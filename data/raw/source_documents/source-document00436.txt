CIVIL GOVERNMENT FOR COMMON SCHOOLS.

PREPARED AS A MANUAL FOR PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

To which are appended the Constitution of the State of New York as
amended at the election of 1880, the Constitution of the United
States, and the Declaration of Independence.

BY HENRY C. NORTHAM,

CONDUCTOR OF TEACHERS' INSTITUTES.


PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.


Instruction in Civil Government should be both theoretical and
practical. Unfortunately the text-books in general use stop with
the theory.

They deal with the science of government, but, being intended for
use throughout the United States, they give no information as to
the ART of government as practiced in this State.

Our students learn what is the guaranty of Republican government,
but not how that government is exercised in their own town.

They are drilled in Incorporeal Hereditaments, but do not learn
what kind of causes can be tried before a Justice of the Peace.

To supply this deficiency, is the aim of the present manual.
Beginning with the school district, the names, manner of election,
duties, and salaries are given of all important officers from the
school trustee to the President of the United States.

The rapid sale of the First and Second Editions of this book
encourages the hope that, with the additions now made, this manual
may be considered indispensable in every PROGRESSIVE school in the
State of New York.

HENRY C. NORTHAM. LOWVILLE, April 22, 1878.
