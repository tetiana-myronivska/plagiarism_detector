     "As formerly, the ticket-holders, with their numbers, were placed in a
     barrel and thoroughly shaken up."--_Hamilton Advertiser._

These repressive measures ought to satisfy even the sternest member of the
Anti-Gambling League.

CIVIL WAR;

_Or, Some Words about CARTER_.

  Not always for the noblest martyr,
    My countrymen, ye forge
      The crown of gold nor wreathe the laurel;
      One protestant ye count as moral,
      Neglect another. Take the quarrel
  Extant between myself and CARTER
    (Henchman of D. LLOYD GEORGE).

  I see the Unionists grow oranger,
    I mark the wigs upon the green,
      The rooted hairs of Ulster bristle
      And all men talk of CARSON'S gristle,
      Then why should this absurd epistle,
  Put down beside my little porringer,
    Provoke not England's spleen?

  Did HAMPDEN positively jeopardise
    His life, and did the axe
      Extinguish CHARLES'S hopes of boodle
      And all the wrongs of bad days feudal
      For this--that CARTER, the old noodle,
  With t's all crossed and dot-bepeppered i's,
    Should change my income-tax?

  Thank heaven that one heart in Albion
    Retains its oaken core;
      Alone I can withstand my duty,
      And so my answer to this beauty
      Is simply "Rats!" and "Rooti-tooti!
  My toll for this year _must_ and _shall_ be on
    The sums declared before."

  If not--if all things go by jobbery
    And tape dyed red with sin,
      Come, let him make a small collusion
      And, when he writes his next effusion,
      Grant me, we'll say, six years' exclusion
  From re-assessments of his robbery.
    And then--I _may_ come in.

  But, if the fiend still stays importunate,
    My blood is up. _Ad lib._,
      Till at the door the bailiff rattles
      And rude men reave me of my chattels,
      I shall prolong these wordy battles,
  And may the just cause prove the fortunate;
    Phoebus defend my nib!

  So long as gray goose yields a pinion,
    So long as ink is damp,
      Mine to resist the loathly fetters
      Of D. LLOYD GEORGE and his abettors,
      Posting innumerable letters
  To CARTER (D. LLOYD GEORGE'S minion),
    Minus the penny stamp.

  EVOE.

A shame to disturb the poor fellow's sleep.

ASKING FOR IT.

The big clock in the station pointed three minutes to the hour, and my
train went at one minute past, so I didn't waste words with the man in the
booking-office.

"Third r'turn, Wat'loo."

Nothing happened. He was there all right, but he neither spoke nor made any
attempt to give me my ticket; he merely looked.

"Third r'turn, Wat'loo," I repeated, and again, inserting my face as far as
possible into the window, very firmly, distinctly and offensively. "Third
re-turn, Wat-er-loo."

Then he spoke, slowly. "Sorry, Sir, I can't do it. You have hit on the one
station to which we don't issue tickets. Any other one I could manage for
you, but----"

"Look here," I said sternly, "you don't seem to know your business. If you
haven't got a printed ticket, can't you make one out on paper? Hurry up,
man; my train leaves in a minute or two."

"Yes," he said more slowly than ever, "I could do that--we have blank forms
for that purpose; but all the same I won't do it."

"Oh, you won't? And why?"

"Well, I don't know what the fare is. I----"
