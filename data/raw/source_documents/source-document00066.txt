Book 20        Proverbs

20:001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

20:001:002 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of
           understanding;

20:001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,
           and equity;

20:001:004 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
           discretion.

20:001:005 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
           understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

20:001:006 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of
           the wise, and their dark sayings.

20:001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
           despise wisdom and instruction.

20:001:008 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not
           the law of thy mother:

20:001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and
           chains about thy neck.

20:001:010 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

20:001:011 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
           lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

20:001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those
           that go down into the pit:

20:001:013 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
           with spoil:

20:001:014 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

20:001:015 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot
           from their path:

20:001:016 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

20:001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

20:001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
           their own lives.

20:001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which
           taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

20:001:020 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

20:001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
           the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

20:001:022 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
           scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

20:001:023 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
           you, I will make known my words unto you.

20:001:024 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
           hand, and no man regarded;

20:001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
           reproof:

20:001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
           cometh;

20:001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
           cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon
           you.

20:001:028 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
           shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

20:001:029 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
           the LORD:

20:001:030 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

20:001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
           filled with their own devices.

20:001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
           prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

20:001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
           quiet from fear of evil.

20:002:001 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
           commandments with thee;

20:002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
           heart to understanding;

20:002:003 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
           for understanding;

20:002:004 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for
           hid treasures;

20:002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the
           knowledge of God.

20:002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
           and understanding.

20:002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler
           to them that walk uprightly.

20:002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
           his saints.

20:002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
           equity; yea, every good path.

20:002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is
           pleasant unto thy soul;

20:002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

20:002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man
           that speaketh froward things;

20:002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
           darkness;

20:002:014 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the
           wicked;

20:002:015 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

20:002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger
           which flattereth with her words;

20:002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
           covenant of her God.

20:002:018 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
           dead.

20:002:019 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of
           the paths of life.

20:002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the
           paths of the righteous.

20:002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
           remain in it.

20:002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
           transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

20:003:001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
           commandments:

20:003:002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add
           to thee.

20:003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy
           neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

20:003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
           of God and man.

20:003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto
           thine own understanding.

20:003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
           paths.

20:003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
           evil.

20:003:008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

20:003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
           of all thine increase:

20:003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
           shall burst out with new wine.

20:003:011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be
           weary of his correction:

20:003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the
           son in whom he delighteth.

20:003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
           understanding.

20:003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
           silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

20:003:015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou
           canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

20:003:016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand
           riches and honour.

20:003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
           peace.

20:003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
           happy is every one that retaineth her.

20:003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
           hath he established the heavens.

20:003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
           down the dew.

20:003:021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
           and discretion:

20:003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

20:003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
           stumble.

20:003:024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou
           shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

20:003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
           wicked, when it cometh.

20:003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
           from being taken.

20:003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in
           the power of thine hand to do it.

20:003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow
           I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

20:003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
           securely by thee.

20:003:030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
           harm.

20:003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

20:003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
           with the righteous.

20:003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he
           blesseth the habitation of the just.

20:003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
           lowly.

20:003:035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion
           of fools.

20:004:001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to
           know understanding.

20:004:002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

20:004:003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the
           sight of my mother.

20:004:004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
           words: keep my commandments, and live.

20:004:005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline
           from the words of my mouth.

20:004:006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and
           she shall keep thee.

20:004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
           all thy getting get understanding.

20:004:008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
           honour, when thou dost embrace her.

20:004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
           glory shall she deliver to thee.

20:004:010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
           life shall be many.

20:004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
           right paths.

20:004:012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
           thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

20:004:013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for
           she is thy life.

20:004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way
           of evil men.

20:004:015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

20:004:016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
           sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

20:004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
           violence.

20:004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
           more and more unto the perfect day.

20:004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what
           they stumble.

20:004:020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

20:004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
           thine heart.

20:004:022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
           their flesh.

20:004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
           issues of life.

20:004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
           from thee.

20:004:025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look
           straight before thee.

20:004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be
           established.

20:004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot
           from evil.

20:005:001 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
           understanding:

20:005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
           knowledge.

20:005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
           mouth is smoother than oil:

20:005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

20:005:005 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

20:005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
           moveable, that thou canst not know them.

20:005:007 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
           words of my mouth.

20:005:008 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
           house:

20:005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
           the cruel:

20:005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be
           in the house of a stranger;

20:005:011 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
           consumed,

20:005:012 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
           reproof;

20:005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
           mine ear to them that instructed me!

20:005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
           assembly.

20:005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out
           of thine own well.

20:005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
           the streets.

20:005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

20:005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
           youth.

20:005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
           breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
           with her love.

20:005:020 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
           and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

20:005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he
           pondereth all his goings.

20:005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
           be holden with the cords of his sins.

20:005:023 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
           folly he shall go astray.

20:006:001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast
           stricken thy hand with a stranger,

20:006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
           with the words of thy mouth.

20:006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
           into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure
           thy friend.

20:006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

20:006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
           bird from the hand of the fowler.

20:006:006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

20:006:007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

20:006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in
           the harvest.

20:006:009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
           of thy sleep?

20:006:010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
           hands to sleep:

20:006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want
           as an armed man.

20:006:012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

20:006:013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he
           teacheth with his fingers;

20:006:014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
           he soweth discord.

20:006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he
           be broken without remedy.

20:006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
           abomination unto him:

20:006:017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent
           blood,

20:006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
           in running to mischief,

20:006:019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord
           among brethren.

20:006:020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law
           of thy mother:

20:006:021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy
           neck.

20:006:022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it
           shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
           thee.

20:006:023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and
           reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

20:006:024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
           tongue of a strange woman.

20:006:025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
           thee with her eyelids.

20:006:026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
           bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

20:006:027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
           burned?

20:006:028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

20:006:029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever
           toucheth her shall not be innocent.

20:006:030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul
           when he is hungry;

20:006:031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give
           all the substance of his house.

20:006:032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
           understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

20:006:033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not
           be wiped away.

20:006:034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare
           in the day of vengeance.

20:006:035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
           though thou givest many gifts.

20:007:001 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

20:007:002 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of
           thine eye.

20:007:003 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
           heart.

20:007:004 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding
           thy kinswoman:

20:007:005 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the
           stranger which flattereth with her words.

20:007:006 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

20:007:007 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
           youths, a young man void of understanding,

20:007:008 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
           way to her house,

20:007:009 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

20:007:010 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an
           harlot, and subtil of heart.

20:007:011 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

20:007:012 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at
           every corner.)

20:007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face
           said unto him,

20:007:014 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

20:007:015 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
           face, and I have found thee.

20:007:016 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
           works, with fine linen of Egypt.

20:007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

20:007:018 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
           solace ourselves with loves.

20:007:019 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

20:007:020 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at
           the day appointed.

20:007:021 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
           flattering of her lips she forced him.

20:007:022 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
           slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

20:007:023 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
           snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

20:007:024 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to
           the words of my mouth.

20:007:025 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
           paths.

20:007:026 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
           been slain by her.

20:007:027 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
           death.

20:008:001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

20:008:002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
           places of the paths.

20:008:003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
           coming in at the doors.

20:008:004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

20:008:005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
           understanding heart.

20:008:006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of
           my lips shall be right things.

20:008:007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an
           abomination to my lips.

20:008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is
           nothing froward or perverse in them.

20:008:009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
           them that find knowledge.

20:008:010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
           than choice gold.

20:008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may
           be desired are not to be compared to it.

20:008:012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
           inventions.

20:008:013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
           and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

20:008:014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
           strength.

20:008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

20:008:016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the
           earth.

20:008:017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall
           find me.

20:008:018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
           righteousness.

20:008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
           revenue than choice silver.

20:008:020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths
           of judgment:

20:008:021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and
           I will fill their treasures.

20:008:022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
           works of old.

20:008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
           earth was.

20:008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
           were no fountains abounding with water.

20:008:025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
           brought forth:

20:008:026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
           the highest part of the dust of the world.

20:008:027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a
           compass upon the face of the depth:

20:008:028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the
           fountains of the deep:

20:008:029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not
           pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the
           earth:

20:008:030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
           his delight, rejoicing always before him;

20:008:031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
           were with the sons of men.

20:008:032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are
           they that keep my ways.

20:008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

20:008:034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
           gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

20:008:035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of
           the LORD.

20:008:036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they
           that hate me love death.

20:009:001 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
           pillars:

20:009:002 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she
           hath also furnished her table.

20:009:003 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
           places of the city,

20:009:004 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that
           wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

20:009:005 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have
           mingled.

20:009:006 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
           understanding.

20:009:007 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he
           that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

20:009:008 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man,
           and he will love thee.

20:009:009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
           teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

20:009:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
           knowledge of the holy is understanding.

20:009:011 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy
           life shall be increased.

20:009:012 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
           scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

20:009:013 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth
           nothing.

20:009:014 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the
           high places of the city,

20:009:015 To call passengers who go right on their ways:

20:009:016 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that
           wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

20:009:017 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
           pleasant.

20:009:018 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her
           guests are in the depths of hell.

20:010:001 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but
           a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

20:010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness
           delivereth from death.

20:010:003 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
           but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

20:010:004 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand
           of the diligent maketh rich.

20:010:005 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that
           sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.

20:010:006 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth
           the mouth of the wicked.

20:010:007 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked
           shall rot.

20:010:008 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating
           fool shall fall.

20:010:009 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that
           perverteth his ways shall be known.

20:010:010 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating
           fool shall fall.

20:010:011 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence
           covereth the mouth of the wicked.

20:010:012 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

20:010:013 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
           but a rod is for the back of him that is void of
           understanding.

20:010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is
           near destruction.

20:010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of
           the poor is their poverty.

20:010:016 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
           wicked to sin.

20:010:017 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
           refuseth reproof erreth.

20:010:018 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
           slander, is a fool.

20:010:019 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
           refraineth his lips is wise.

20:010:020 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the
           wicked is little worth.

20:010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
           wisdom.

20:010:022 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
           sorrow with it.

20:010:023 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
           understanding hath wisdom.

20:010:024 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
           of the righteous shall be granted.

20:010:025 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
           righteous is an everlasting foundation.

20:010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
           sluggard to them that send him.

20:010:027 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the
           wicked shall be shortened.

20:010:028 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the
           expectation of the wicked shall perish.

20:010:029 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but
           destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

20:010:030 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
           inhabit the earth.

20:010:031 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
           tongue shall be cut out.

20:010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the
           mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

20:011:001 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight
           is his delight.

20:011:002 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is
           wisdom.

20:011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the
           perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

20:011:004 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness
           delivereth from death.

20:011:005 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the
           wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

20:011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
           transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

20:011:007 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the
           hope of unjust men perisheth.

20:011:008 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
           cometh in his stead.

20:011:009 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but
           through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

20:011:010 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and
           when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

20:011:011 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is
           overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

20:011:012 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man
           of understanding holdeth his peace.

20:011:013 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful
           spirit concealeth the matter.

20:011:014 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
           counsellors there is safety.

20:011:015 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he
           that hateth suretiship is sure.

20:011:016 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain
           riches.

20:011:017 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
           cruel troubleth his own flesh.

20:011:018 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
           righteousness shall be a sure reward.

20:011:019 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
           pursueth it to his own death.

20:011:020 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
           but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

20:011:021 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
           but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

20:011:022 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
           which is without discretion.

20:011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation
           of the wicked is wrath.

20:011:024 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is
           that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

20:011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall
           be watered also himself.

20:011:026 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but
           blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

20:011:027 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
           seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

20:011:028 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous
           shall flourish as a branch.

20:011:029 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and
           the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

20:011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that
           winneth souls is wise.

20:011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much
           more the wicked and the sinner.

20:012:001 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
           reproof is brutish.

20:012:002 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked
           devices will he condemn.

20:012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of
           the righteous shall not be moved.

20:012:004 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that
           maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

20:012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of
           the wicked are deceit.

20:012:006 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the
           mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

20:012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the
           righteous shall stand.

20:012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that
           is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

20:012:009 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he
           that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

20:012:010 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the
           tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

20:012:011 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he
           that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

20:012:012 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the
           righteous yieldeth fruit.

20:012:013 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the
           just shall come out of trouble.

20:012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
           and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto
           him.

20:012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that
           hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

20:012:016 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth
           shame.

20:012:017 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a
           false witness deceit.

20:012:018 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the
           tongue of the wise is health.

20:012:019 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying
           tongue is but for a moment.

20:012:020 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the
           counsellors of peace is joy.

20:012:021 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall
           be filled with mischief.

20:012:022 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal
           truly are his delight.

20:012:023 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools
           proclaimeth foolishness.

20:012:024 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful
           shall be under tribute.

20:012:025 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
           maketh it glad.

20:012:026 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the
           way of the wicked seduceth them.

20:012:027 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
           but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

20:012:028 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway
           thereof there is no death.

20:013:001 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner
           heareth not rebuke.

20:013:002 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul
           of the transgressors shall eat violence.

20:013:003 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that
           openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

20:013:004 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the
           soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

20:013:005 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome,
           and cometh to shame.

20:013:006 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but
           wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

20:013:007 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is
           that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

20:013:008 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor
           heareth not rebuke.

20:013:009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the
           wicked shall be put out.

20:013:010 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is
           wisdom.

20:013:011 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
           gathereth by labour shall increase.

20:013:012 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire
           cometh, it is a tree of life.

20:013:013 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that
           feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

20:013:014 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the
           snares of death.

20:013:015 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors
           is hard.

20:013:016 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth
           open his folly.

20:013:017 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful
           ambassador is health.

20:013:018 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
           but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

20:013:019 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is
           abomination to fools to depart from evil.

20:013:020 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion
           of fools shall be destroyed.

20:013:021 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
           repayed.

20:013:022 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
           and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

20:013:023 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is
           destroyed for want of judgment.

20:013:024 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
           chasteneth him betimes.

20:013:025 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the
           belly of the wicked shall want.

20:014:001 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh
           it down with her hands.

20:014:002 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he
           that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.

20:014:003 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of
           the wise shall preserve them.

20:014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by
           the strength of the ox.

20:014:005 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will
           utter lies.

20:014:006 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is
           easy unto him that understandeth.

20:014:007 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
           not in him the lips of knowledge.

20:014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the
           folly of fools is deceit.

20:014:009 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is
           favour.

20:014:010 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
           intermeddle with his joy.

20:014:011 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
           tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

20:014:012 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
           thereof are the ways of death.

20:014:013 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
           mirth is heaviness.

20:014:014 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and
           a good man shall be satisfied from himself.

20:014:015 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh
           well to his going.

20:014:016 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
           rageth, and is confident.

20:014:017 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
           devices is hated.

20:014:018 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
           knowledge.

20:014:019 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of
           the righteous.

20:014:020 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath
           many friends.

20:014:021 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath
           mercy on the poor, happy is he.

20:014:022 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be
           to them that devise good.

20:014:023 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips
           tendeth only to penury.

20:014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of
           fools is folly.

20:014:025 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness
           speaketh lies.

20:014:026 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children
           shall have a place of refuge.

20:014:027 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the
           snares of death.

20:014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the
           want of people is the destruction of the prince.

20:014:029 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he
           that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

20:014:030 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the
           rottenness of the bones.

20:014:031 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
           honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

20:014:032 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
           hath hope in his death.

20:014:033 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
           but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

20:014:034 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
           people.

20:014:035 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is
           against him that causeth shame.

20:015:001 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
           anger.

20:015:002 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
           of fools poureth out foolishness.

20:015:003 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil
           and the good.

20:015:004 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein
           is a breach in the spirit.

20:015:005 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that
           regardeth reproof is prudent.

20:015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the
           revenues of the wicked is trouble.

20:015:007 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the
           foolish doeth not so.

20:015:008 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but
           the prayer of the upright is his delight.

20:015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he
           loveth him that followeth after righteousness.

20:015:010 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he
           that hateth reproof shall die.

20:015:011 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then
           the hearts of the children of men?

20:015:012 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he
           go unto the wise.

20:015:013 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of
           the heart the spirit is broken.

20:015:014 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
           but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

20:015:015 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a
           merry heart hath a continual feast.

20:015:016 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
           and trouble therewith.

20:015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox
           and hatred therewith.

20:015:018 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to
           anger appeaseth strife.

20:015:019 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the
           way of the righteous is made plain.

20:015:020 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth
           his mother.

20:015:021 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
           understanding walketh uprightly.

20:015:022 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the
           multitude of counsellors they are established.

20:015:023 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken
           in due season, how good is it!

20:015:024 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from
           hell beneath.

20:015:025 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will
           establish the border of the widow.

20:015:026 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but
           the words of the pure are pleasant words.

20:015:027 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
           hateth gifts shall live.

20:015:028 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth
           of the wicked poureth out evil things.

20:015:029 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
           the righteous.

20:015:030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report
           maketh the bones fat.

20:015:031 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the
           wise.

20:015:032 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he
           that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

20:015:033 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before
           honour is humility.

20:016:001 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
           tongue, is from the LORD.

20:016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
           weigheth the spirits.

20:016:003 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
           established.

20:016:004 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the
           wicked for the day of evil.

20:016:005 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the
           LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

20:016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
           LORD men depart from evil.

20:016:007 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies
           to be at peace with him.

20:016:008 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues
           without right.

20:016:009 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his
           steps.

20:016:010 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth
           transgresseth not in judgment.

20:016:011 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of
           the bag are his work.

20:016:012 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
           throne is established by righteousness.

20:016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him
           that speaketh right.

20:016:014 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man
           will pacify it.

20:016:015 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour
           is as a cloud of the latter rain.

20:016:016 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
           understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

20:016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that
           keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

20:016:018 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a
           fall.

20:016:019 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
           divide the spoil with the proud.

20:016:020 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso
           trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

20:016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness
           of the lips increaseth learning.

20:016:022 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
           but the instruction of fools is folly.

20:016:023 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning
           to his lips.

20:016:024 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
           health to the bones.

20:016:025 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
           thereof are the ways of death.

20:016:026 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth
           it of him.

20:016:027 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a
           burning fire.

20:016:028 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
           friends.

20:016:029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the
           way that is not good.

20:016:030 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips
           he bringeth evil to pass.

20:016:031 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way
           of righteousness.

20:016:032 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he
           that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

20:016:033 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
           is of the LORD.

20:017:001 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house
           full of sacrifices with strife.

20:017:002 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
           and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

20:017:003 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but
           the LORD trieth the hearts.

20:017:004 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear
           to a naughty tongue.

20:017:005 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is
           glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

20:017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of
           children are their fathers.

20:017:007 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips
           a prince.

20:017:008 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
           whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

20:017:009 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
           repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

20:017:010 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred
           stripes into a fool.

20:017:011 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel
           messenger shall be sent against him.

20:017:012 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool
           in his folly.

20:017:013 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
           house.

20:017:014 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
           therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

20:017:015 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
           just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.

20:017:016 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
           wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

20:017:017 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
           adversity.

20:017:018 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh
           surety in the presence of his friend.

20:017:019 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that
           exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

20:017:020 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath
           a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

20:017:021 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the
           father of a fool hath no joy.

20:017:022 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
           drieth the bones.

20:017:023 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the
           ways of judgment.

20:017:024 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of
           a fool are in the ends of the earth.

20:017:025 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her
           that bare him.

20:017:026 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
           equity.

20:017:027 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of
           understanding is of an excellent spirit.

20:017:028 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and
           he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

20:018:001 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
           intermeddleth with all wisdom.

20:018:002 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
           may discover itself.

20:018:003 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with
           ignominy reproach.

20:018:004 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the
           wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

20:018:005 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to
           overthrow the righteous in judgment.

20:018:006 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
           strokes.

20:018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare
           of his soul.

20:018:008 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
           the innermost parts of the belly.

20:018:009 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is
           a great waster.

20:018:010 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth
           into it, and is safe.

20:018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall
           in his own conceit.

20:018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before
           honour is humility.

20:018:013 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly
           and shame unto him.

20:018:014 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
           spirit who can bear?

20:018:015 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the
           wise seeketh knowledge.

20:018:016 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before
           great men.

20:018:017 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his
           neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

20:018:018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
           mighty.

20:018:019 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and
           their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

20:018:020 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
           and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

20:018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
           love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

20:018:022 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
           favour of the LORD.

20:018:023 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

20:018:024 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there
           is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

20:019:001 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that
           is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

20:019:002 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and
           he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

20:019:003 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart
           fretteth against the LORD.

20:019:004 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
           neighbour.

20:019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
           lies shall not escape.

20:019:006 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a
           friend to him that giveth gifts.

20:019:007 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
           friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they
           are wanting to him.

20:019:008 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
           understanding shall find good.

20:019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
           lies shall perish.

20:019:010 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to
           have rule over princes.

20:019:011 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his
           glory to pass over a transgression.

20:019:012 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour
           is as dew upon the grass.

20:019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the
           contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

20:019:014 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent
           wife is from the LORD.

20:019:015 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall
           suffer hunger.

20:019:016 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he
           that despiseth his ways shall die.

20:019:017 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and
           that which he hath given will he pay him again.

20:019:018 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul
           spare for his crying.

20:019:019 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
           deliver him, yet thou must do it again.

20:019:020 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be
           wise in thy latter end.

20:019:021 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the
           counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

20:019:022 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better
           than a liar.

20:019:023 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it
           shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

20:019:024 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so
           much as bring it to his mouth again.

20:019:025 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
           that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

20:019:026 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a
           son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

20:019:027 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err
           from the words of knowledge.

20:019:028 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
           wicked devoureth iniquity.

20:019:029 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back
           of fools.

20:020:001 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is
           deceived thereby is not wise.

20:020:002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso
           provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.

20:020:003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool
           will be meddling.

20:020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore
           shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

20:020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
           understanding will draw it out.

20:020:006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
           faithful man who can find?

20:020:007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are
           blessed after him.

20:020:008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away
           all evil with his eyes.

20:020:009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
           sin?

20:020:010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
           abomination to the LORD.

20:020:011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
           and whether it be right.

20:020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even
           both of them.

20:020:013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
           and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

20:020:014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
           gone his way, then he boasteth.

20:020:015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
           knowledge are a precious jewel.

20:020:016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a
           pledge of him for a strange woman.

20:020:017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth
           shall be filled with gravel.

20:020:018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
           make war.

20:020:019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
           therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

20:020:020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
           out in obscure darkness.

20:020:021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
           end thereof shall not be blessed.

20:020:022 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD,
           and he shall save thee.

20:020:023 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
           balance is not good.

20:020:024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand
           his own way?

20:020:025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and
           after vows to make enquiry.

20:020:026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
           them.

20:020:027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
           inward parts of the belly.

20:020:028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden
           by mercy.

20:020:029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of
           old men is the grey head.

20:020:030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
           inward parts of the belly.

20:021:001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of
           water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

20:021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD
           pondereth the hearts.

20:021:003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
           sacrifice.

20:021:004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the
           wicked, is sin.

20:021:005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but
           of every one that is hasty only to want.

20:021:006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed
           to and fro of them that seek death.

20:021:007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they
           refuse to do judgment.

20:021:008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure,
           his work is right.

20:021:009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
           brawling woman in a wide house.

20:021:010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
           favour in his eyes.

20:021:011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and
           when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

20:021:012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
           but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

20:021:013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall
           cry himself, but shall not be heard.

20:021:014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
           strong wrath.

20:021:015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be
           to the workers of iniquity.

20:021:016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
           remain in the congregation of the dead.

20:021:017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth
           wine and oil shall not be rich.

20:021:018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the
           transgressor for the upright.

20:021:019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
           contentious and an angry woman.

20:021:020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
           wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

20:021:021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
           righteousness, and honour.

20:021:022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down
           the strength of the confidence thereof.

20:021:023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
           troubles.

20:021:024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud
           wrath.

20:021:025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse
           to labour.

20:021:026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous
           giveth and spareth not.

20:021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more,
           when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

20:021:028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth
           speaketh constantly.

20:021:029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he
           directeth his way.

20:021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
           LORD.

20:021:031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
           of the LORD.

20:022:001 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
           loving favour rather than silver and gold.

20:022:002 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them
           all.

20:022:003 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
           simple pass on, and are punished.

20:022:004 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour,
           and life.

20:022:005 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth
           keep his soul shall be far from them.

20:022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
           he will not depart from it.

20:022:007 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to
           the lender.

20:022:008 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his
           anger shall fail.

20:022:009 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth
           of his bread to the poor.

20:022:010 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife
           and reproach shall cease.

20:022:011 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips
           the king shall be his friend.

20:022:012 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth
           the words of the transgressor.

20:022:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be
           slain in the streets.

20:022:014 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred
           of the LORD shall fall therein.

20:022:015 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
           correction shall drive it far from him.

20:022:016 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
           that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

20:022:017 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply
           thine heart unto my knowledge.

20:022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
           shall withal be fitted in thy lips.

20:022:019 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee
           this day, even to thee.

20:022:020 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
           knowledge,

20:022:021 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of
           truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
           that send unto thee?

20:022:022 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the
           afflicted in the gate:

20:022:023 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
           those that spoiled them.

20:022:024 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
           thou shalt not go:

20:022:025 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

20:022:026 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
           sureties for debts.

20:022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed
           from under thee?

20:022:028 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

20:022:029 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand
           before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

20:023:001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
           what is before thee:

20:023:002 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to
           appetite.

20:023:003 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

20:023:004 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

20:023:005 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
           certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle
           toward heaven.

20:023:006 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither
           desire thou his dainty meats:

20:023:007 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,
           saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

20:023:008 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
           thy sweet words.

20:023:009 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the
           wisdom of thy words.

20:023:010 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
           the fatherless:

20:023:011 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
           thee.

20:023:012 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the
           words of knowledge.

20:023:013 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest
           him with the rod, he shall not die.

20:023:014 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
           from hell.

20:023:015 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even
           mine.

20:023:016 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

20:023:017 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of
           the LORD all the day long.

20:023:018 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be
           cut off.

20:023:019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the
           way.

20:023:020 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

20:023:021 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
           drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

20:023:022 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
           mother when she is old.

20:023:023 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,
           and understanding.

20:023:024 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
           begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

20:023:025 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
           thee shall rejoice.

20:023:026 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my
           ways.

20:023:027 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
           pit.

20:023:028 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
           transgressors among men.

20:023:029 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
           babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
           eyes?

20:023:030 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed
           wine.

20:023:031 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
           colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

20:023:032 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
           adder.

20:023:033 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall
           utter perverse things.

20:023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
           sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

20:023:035 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick;
           they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I
           will seek it yet again.

20:024:001 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be
           with them.

20:024:002 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
           mischief.

20:024:003 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
           established:

20:024:004 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
           precious and pleasant riches.

20:024:005 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
           strength.

20:024:006 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude
           of counsellors there is safety.

20:024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
           gate.

20:024:008 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous
           person.

20:024:009 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an
           abomination to men.

20:024:010 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

20:024:011 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
           those that are ready to be slain;

20:024:012 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that
           pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul,
           doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man
           according to his works?

20:024:013 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb,
           which is sweet to thy taste:

20:024:014 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou
           hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy
           expectation shall not be cut off.

20:024:015 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
           righteous; spoil not his resting place:

20:024:016 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but
           the wicked shall fall into mischief.

20:024:017 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart
           be glad when he stumbleth:

20:024:018 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
           his wrath from him.

20:024:019 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious
           at the wicked:

20:024:020 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of
           the wicked shall be put out.

20:024:021 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with
           them that are given to change:

20:024:022 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the
           ruin of them both?

20:024:023 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have
           respect of persons in judgment.

20:024:024 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall
           the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

20:024:025 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good
           blessing shall come upon them.

20:024:026 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

20:024:027 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
           field; and afterwards build thine house.

20:024:028 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and
           deceive not with thy lips.

20:024:029 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will
           render to the man according to his work.

20:024:030 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
           the man void of understanding;

20:024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
           covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
           broken down.

20:024:032 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and
           received instruction.

20:024:033 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
           hands to sleep:

20:024:034 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want
           as an armed man.

20:025:001 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
           king of Judah copied out.

20:025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
           kings is to search out a matter.

20:025:003 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart
           of kings is unsearchable.

20:025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come
           forth a vessel for the finer.

20:025:005 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne
           shall be established in righteousness.

20:025:006 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand
           not in the place of great men:

20:025:007 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
           than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
           prince whom thine eyes have seen.

20:025:008 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do
           in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

20:025:009 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not
           a secret to another:

20:025:010 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy
           turn not away.

20:025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
           silver.

20:025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a
           wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

20:025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
           messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of
           his masters.

20:025:014 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
           without rain.

20:025:015 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
           breaketh the bone.

20:025:016 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
           lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

20:025:017 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
           of thee, and so hate thee.

20:025:018 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
           maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

20:025:019 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
           broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

20:025:020 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as
           vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy
           heart.

20:025:021 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
           thirsty, give him water to drink:

20:025:022 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD
           shall reward thee.

20:025:023 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance
           a backbiting tongue.

20:025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with
           a brawling woman and in a wide house.

20:025:025 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
           country.

20:025:026 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a
           troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

20:025:027 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their
           own glory is not glory.

20:025:028 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that
           is broken down, and without walls.

20:026:001 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
           seemly for a fool.

20:026:002 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
           curse causeless shall not come.

20:026:003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
           fool's back.

20:026:004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
           like unto him.

20:026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his
           own conceit.

20:026:006 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off
           the feet, and drinketh damage.

20:026:007 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the
           mouth of fools.

20:026:008 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth
           honour to a fool.

20:026:009 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a
           parable in the mouths of fools.

20:026:010 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,
           and rewardeth transgressors.

20:026:011 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
           folly.

20:026:012 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope
           of a fool than of him.

20:026:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is
           in the streets.

20:026:014 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon
           his bed.

20:026:015 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
           bring it again to his mouth.

20:026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
           can render a reason.

20:026:017 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to
           him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

20:026:018 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

20:026:019 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not
           I in sport?

20:026:020 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is
           no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

20:026:021 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
           contentious man to kindle strife.

20:026:022 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
           the innermost parts of the belly.

20:026:023 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered
           with silver dross.

20:026:024 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
           within him;

20:026:025 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
           abominations in his heart.

20:026:026 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
           shewed before the whole congregation.

20:026:027 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
           stone, it will return upon him.

20:026:028 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
           flattering mouth worketh ruin.

20:027:001 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
           day may bring forth.

20:027:002 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
           stranger, and not thine own lips.

20:027:003 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
           heavier than them both.

20:027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to
           stand before envy?

20:027:005 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

20:027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
           enemy are deceitful.

20:027:007 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
           every bitter thing is sweet.

20:027:008 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
           wandereth from his place.

20:027:009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness
           of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

20:027:010 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
           neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy
           calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a
           brother far off.

20:027:011 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him
           that reproacheth me.

20:027:012 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
           simple pass on, and are punished.

20:027:013 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
           pledge of him for a strange woman.

20:027:014 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in
           the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

20:027:015 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious
           woman are alike.

20:027:016 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
           right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

20:027:017 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
           his friend.

20:027:018 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
           that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

20:027:019 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
           man.

20:027:020 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
           never satisfied.

20:027:021 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is
           a man to his praise.

20:027:022 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with
           a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

20:027:023 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look
           well to thy herds.

20:027:024 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to
           every generation?

20:027:025 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and
           herbs of the mountains are gathered.

20:027:026 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of
           the field.

20:027:027 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the
           food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy
           maidens.

20:028:001 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are
           bold as a lion.

20:028:002 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
           but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof
           shall be prolonged.

20:028:003 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain
           which leaveth no food.

20:028:004 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep
           the law contend with them.

20:028:005 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD
           understand all things.

20:028:006 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he
           that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

20:028:007 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a
           companion of riotous men shameth his father.

20:028:008 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he
           shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

20:028:009 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his
           prayer shall be abomination.

20:028:010 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he
           shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall
           have good things in possession.

20:028:011 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
           hath understanding searcheth him out.

20:028:012 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when
           the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

20:028:013 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
           confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

20:028:014 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his
           heart shall fall into mischief.

20:028:015 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler
           over the poor people.

20:028:016 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great
           oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his
           days.

20:028:017 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall
           flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

20:028:018 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is
           perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

20:028:019 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he
           that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

20:028:020 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh
           haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

20:028:021 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of
           bread that man will transgress.

20:028:022 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth
           not that poverty shall come upon him.

20:028:023 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than
           he that flattereth with the tongue.

20:028:024 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
           transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

20:028:025 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
           putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

20:028:026 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
           wisely, he shall be delivered.

20:028:027 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that
           hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

20:028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they
           perish, the righteous increase.

20:029:001 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall
           suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

20:029:002 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but
           when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

20:029:003 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth
           company with harlots spendeth his substance.

20:029:004 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that
           receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

20:029:005 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his
           feet.

20:029:006 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the
           righteous doth sing and rejoice.

20:029:007 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the
           wicked regardeth not to know it.

20:029:008 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away
           wrath.

20:029:009 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage
           or laugh, there is no rest.

20:029:010 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

20:029:011 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in
           till afterwards.

20:029:012 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.

20:029:013 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD
           lighteneth both their eyes.

20:029:014 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
           established for ever.

20:029:015 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
           bringeth his mother to shame.

20:029:016 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but
           the righteous shall see their fall.

20:029:017 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall
           give delight unto thy soul.

20:029:018 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that
           keepeth the law, happy is he.

20:029:019 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he
           understand he will not answer.

20:029:020 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more
           hope of a fool than of him.

20:029:021 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
           have him become his son at the length.

20:029:022 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth
           in transgression.

20:029:023 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
           humble in spirit.

20:029:024 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth
           cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

20:029:025 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust
           in the LORD shall be safe.

20:029:026 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh
           from the LORD.

20:029:027 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is
           upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

20:030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man
           spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

20:030:002 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
           understanding of a man.

20:030:003 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

20:030:004 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath
           gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a
           garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what
           is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

20:030:005 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put
           their trust in him.

20:030:006 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
           found a liar.

20:030:007 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I
           die:

20:030:008 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty
           nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

20:030:009 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or
           lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in
           vain.

20:030:010 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and
           thou be found guilty.

20:030:011 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not
           bless their mother.

20:030:012 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
           is not washed from their filthiness.

20:030:013 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their
           eyelids are lifted up.

20:030:014 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their
           jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth,
           and the needy from among men.

20:030:015 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There
           are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things
           say not, It is enough:

20:030:016 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled
           with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

20:030:017 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
           mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the
           young eagles shall eat it.

20:030:018 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea,
           four which I know not:

20:030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a
           rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way
           of a man with a maid.

20:030:020 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
           her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

20:030:021 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which
           it cannot bear:

20:030:022 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled
           with meat;

20:030:023 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that
           is heir to her mistress.

20:030:024 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they
           are exceeding wise:

20:030:025 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat
           in the summer;

20:030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
           in the rocks;

20:030:027 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by
           bands;

20:030:028 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'
           palaces.

20:030:029 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in
           going:

20:030:030 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away
           for any;

20:030:031 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there
           is no rising up.

20:030:032 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou
           hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

20:030:033 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the
           wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of
           wrath bringeth forth strife.

20:031:001 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
           him.

20:031:002 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son
           of my vows?

20:031:003 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
           destroyeth kings.

20:031:004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink
           wine; nor for princes strong drink:

20:031:005 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment
           of any of the afflicted.

20:031:006 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
           unto those that be of heavy hearts.

20:031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery
           no more.

20:031:008 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
           appointed to destruction.

20:031:009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the
           poor and needy.

20:031:010 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
           rubies.

20:031:011 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he
           shall have no need of spoil.

20:031:012 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

20:031:013 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her
           hands.

20:031:014 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from
           afar.

20:031:015 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
           household, and a portion to her maidens.

20:031:016 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
           hands she planteth a vineyard.

20:031:017 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her
           arms.

20:031:018 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
           not out by night.

20:031:019 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
           distaff.

20:031:020 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
           forth her hands to the needy.

20:031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
           household are clothed with scarlet.

20:031:022 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk
           and purple.

20:031:023 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
           elders of the land.

20:031:024 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
           unto the merchant.

20:031:025 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
           time to come.

20:031:026 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
           law of kindness.

20:031:027 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
           the bread of idleness.

20:031:028 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
           and he praiseth her.

20:031:029 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
           all.

20:031:030 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
           feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

20:031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
           praise her in the gates.
