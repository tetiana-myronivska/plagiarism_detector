            till,
  And strike, if he could, were it but with his cheating yard-wand, home.

LYRA HEROICA


  I

  AGINCOURT


  INTROIT

  O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
  The brightest heaven of invention,
  A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
  And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
  Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
  Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
  Leashed in like hounds, should Famine, Sword and Fire
  Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,
  The flat unraisèd spirits that have dared
  On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
  So great an object. Can this cockpit hold
  The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
  Within this wooden O the very casques
  That did affright the air at Agincourt?
  O pardon! since a crooked figure may
  Attest in little place a million,
  And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
  On your imaginary forces work.
  Suppose within the girdle of these walls
  Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
  Whose high uprearèd and abutting fronts
  The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
  Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
  Into a thousand parts divide one man,
  And make imaginary puissance;
  Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them
  Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
  For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
  Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,
  Turning the accomplishment of many years
  Into an hour-glass.


  INTERLUDE

  Now all the youth of England are on fire,
  And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
  Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
  Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
  They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
  Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
  With wingèd heels, as English Mercuries:
  For now sits Expectation in the air,
  And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
  With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
  Promised to Harry and his followers.
  The French, advised by good intelligence
  Of this most dreadful preparation,
  Shake in their fear, and with pale policy
  Seek to divert the English purposes.
  O England! model to thy inward greatness,
  Like little body with a mighty heart,
  What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
  Were all thy children kind and natural!
  But see thy fault: France hath in thee found out
  A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
  With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
  One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
  Have for the gilt of France--O guilt indeed!--
  Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France;
  And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
  If hell and treason hold their promises,
  Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton!--


  HARFLEUR

  Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
  In motion of no less celerity
  Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
  The well-appointed king at Hampton Pier
  Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet
  With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:
  Play with your fancies, and in them behold
  Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
  Borne with the invisible and creeping wind
  Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea
  Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think
  You stand upon the rivage and behold
  A city on the inconstant billows dancing!
  For so appears this fleet majestical,
  Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:
  Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
  And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
  Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,
  Or passed or not arrived to pith and puissance;
  For who is he, whose chin is but enriched
  With one appearing hair, that will not follow
  These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege:
  Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
  With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
  Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
  Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
  Katharine his daughter, and with her to dowry
  Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
  The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
  With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
  And down goes all before them!


  THE EVE

  Now entertain conjecture of a time
  When creeping murmur and the poring dark
  Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
  From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
  The hum of either army stilly sounds,
  That the fixed sentinels almost receive
  The secret whispers of each other's watch:
  Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
  Each battle sees the other's umbered face;
  Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
  Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
  The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
  With busy hammers closing rivets up,
  Give dreadful note of preparation.
  The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
  And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
  Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
  The confident and over-lusty French
  Do the low-rated English play at dice,
  And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night
  Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
  So tediously away. The poor condemnèd English,
  Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
  Sit patiently and inly ruminate
  The morning's danger, and their gesture sad,
  Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,
  Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
  So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
  The royal captain of this ruined band
  Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
  Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
  For forth he goes and visits all his host,
  Bids them good-morrow with a modest smile,
  And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
  Upon his royal face there is no note
  How dread an army hath enrounded him;
  Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
  Unto the weary and all-watchèd night,
  But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
  With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,
  That every wretch, pining and pale before,
  Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.
  A largess universal like the sun
  His liberal eye doth give to every one,
  Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
  Behold, as may unworthiness define,
  A little touch of Harry in the night--
  And so our scene must to the battle fly.

                                    _Shakespeare._


  THE BATTLE

  Fair stood the wind for France,
  When we our sails advance,
  Nor now to prove our chance
      Longer will tarry;
  But putting to the main,
  At Caux, the mouth of Seine,
  With all his martial train,
      Landed King Harry.

  And taking many a fort,
  Furnished in warlike sort,
  Marched towards Agincourt
      In happy hour,
  Skirmishing day by day
  With those that stopped his way,
  Where the French gen'ral lay
      With all his power:

  Which, in his height of pride,
  King Henry to deride,
  His ransom to provide
      To the king sending;
  Which he neglects the while
  As from a nation vile,
  Yet with an angry smile
      Their fall portending.

  And turning to his men,
  Quoth our brave Henry then,
  'Though they to one be ten,
      Be not amazèd.
  Yet have we well begun,
  Battles so bravely won
  Have ever to the sun
      By fame been raisèd.

  And for myself, quoth he,
  This my full rest shall be:
  England ne'er mourn for me,
      Nor more esteem me;
  Victor I will remain
  Or on this earth lie slain;
  Never shall she sustain
      Loss to redeem me.

  Poitiers and Cressy tell,
  When most their pride did swell,
  Under our swords they fell;
      No less our skill is
  Than when our grandsire great,
  Claiming the regal seat,
  By many a warlike feat
      Lopped the French lilies.'

  The Duke of York so dread
  The eager vaward led;
  With the main Henry sped,
      Amongst his henchmen;
  Excester had the rear,
  A braver man not there:
  O Lord, how hot they were
      On the false Frenchmen!

  They now to fight are gone,
  Armour on armour shone,
  Drum now to drum did groan,
      To hear was wonder;
  That with the cries they make
  The very earth did shake,
  Trumpet to trumpet spake,
      Thunder to thunder.

  Well it thine age became,
  O noble Erpingham,
  Which did the signal aim
      To our hid forces!
  When from the meadow by,
  Like a storm suddenly,
  The English archery
      Struck the French horses.

  With Spanish yew so strong,
  Arrows a cloth-yard long,
  That like to serpents stung,
      Piercing the weather;
  None from his fellow starts,
  But playing manly parts,
  And like true English hearts
      Stuck close together.

  When down their bows they threw,
  And forth their bilbos drew,
  And on the French they flew,
      Not one was tardy;
  Arms were from shoulders sent,
  Scalps to the teeth were rent,
  Down the French peasants went;
      Our men were hardy.

  This while our noble king,
  His broadsword brandishing,
  Down the French host did ding
      As to o'erwhelm it,
  And many a deep wound lent,
  His arms with blood besprent,
  And many a cruel dent
      Bruisèd his helmet.

  Glo'ster, that duke so good,
  Next of the royal blood,
  For famous England stood,
      With his brave brother;
  Clarence, in steel so bright,
  Though but a maiden knight,
  Yet in that furious fight
      Scarce such another!

  Warwick in blood did wade,
  Oxford the foe invade,
  And cruel slaughter made,
      Still as they ran up;
  Suffolk his axe did ply,
  Beaumont and Willoughby
  Bare them right doughtily,
      Ferrers and Fanhope.

  Upon Saint Crispin's Day
  Fought was this noble fray,
  Which fame did not delay,
      To England to carry.
  O, when shall Englishmen
  With such acts fill a pen,
  Or England breed again
      Such a King Harry?

                                    _Drayton._


  AFTER

                Now we bear the king
  Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,
  Heave him away upon your wingèd thoughts
  Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouthed sea,
  Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king
  Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,
  And solemnly see him set on to London.
  So swift a pace hath thought that even now
  You may imagine him upon Blackheath;
  Where that his lords desire him to have borne
  His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword
  Before him through the city: he forbids it,
  Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,
  Giving full trophy, signal and ostent,
  Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
  In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
  How London doth pour out her citizens!
  The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
  Like to the senators of the antique Rome,
  With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
  Go forth and fetch their conquering Cæsar in!

                                    _Shakespeare._

  LORD OF HIMSELF


  How happy is he born or taught
    Who serveth not another's will;
  Whose armour is his honest thought,
    And simple truth his highest skill;

  Whose passions not his masters are;
    Whose soul is still prepared for death--
  Not tied unto the world with care
    Of prince's ear or vulgar breath;

  Who hath his ear from rumours freed;
    Whose conscience is his strong retreat;
  Whose state can neither flatterers feed,
    Nor ruin make oppressors great;

  Who envies none whom chance doth raise,
    Or vice; who never understood
  How deepest wounds are given with praise,
    Nor rules of state but rules of good;

  Who God doth late and early pray
    More of his grace than gifts to lend,
  And entertains the harmless day
    With a well-chosen book or friend--

  This man is free from servile bands
    Of hope to rise or fear to fall:
  Lord of himself, though not of lands,
    And, having nothing, yet hath all.

                                    _Wotton._

  TRUE BALM


      High-spirited friend,
  I send nor balms nor corsives to your wound;
      Your faith hath found
  A gentler and more agile hand to tend
  The cure of that which is but corporal,
  And doubtful days, which were named critical,
      Have made their fairest flight
      And now are out of sight.
  Yet doth some wholesome physic for the mind,
          Wrapped in this paper lie,
  Which in the taking if you misapply
          You are unkind.

      Your covetous hand,
  Happy in that fair honour it hath gained,
      Must now be reined.
  True valour doth her own renown commend
  In one full action; nor have you now more
  To do than be a husband of that store.
      Think but how dear you bought
      This same which you have caught--
  Such thoughts will make you more in love with truth
          'Tis wisdom, and that high,
  For men to use their fortune reverently,
          Even in youth.

                                    _Jonson._

  HONOUR IN BUD


  It is not growing like a tree
  In bulk doth make man better be:
        A lily of a day
        Is fairer far in May:
  Although it fall and die that night,
  It was the plant and flower of light.

                                    _Jonson._


  V

  THE JOY OF BATTLE


  Arm, arm, arm, arm! the scouts are all come in;
  Keep your ranks close, and now your honours win.
  Behold from yonder hill the foe appears;
  Bows, bills, glaives, arrows, shields, and spears!
  Like a dark wood he comes, or tempest pouring;
  O view the wings of horse the meadows scouring!
  The vanguard marches bravely. Hark, the drums!
                                Dub, dub!

  They meet, they meet, and now the battle comes:
            See how the arrows fly
            That darken all the sky!
            Hark how the trumpets sound!
            Hark how the hills rebound--
                        Tara, tara, tara, tara, tara!

  Hark how the horses charge! in, boys! boys, in!
  The battle totters; now the wounds begin:
            O how they cry!
            O how they die!
  Room for the valiant Memnon, armed with thunder!
      See how he breaks the ranks asunder!
  They fly! they fly! Eumenes has the chase,
  And brave Polybius makes good his place:
            To the plains, to the woods,
            To the rocks, to the floods,
  They fly for succour. Follow, follow, follow!
  Hark how the soldiers hollow!
                                        Hey, hey!

            Brave Diocles is dead,
            And all his soldiers fled;
            The battle's won, and lost,
            That many a life hath cost.

  IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY


  Mortality, behold and fear!
  What a change of flesh is here!
  Think how many royal bones
  Sleep beneath this heap of stones!
  Here they lie had realms and lands,
  Who now want strength to stir their hands.
  Here from their pulpits sealed with dust
  They preach, 'In greatness is no trust.'
  Here is an acre sown indeed
  With the richest, royall'st seed
  That the earth did e'er suck in,
  Since the first man died for sin.
  Here the bones of birth have cried,
  'Though gods they were, as men they died.'
  Here are sands, ignoble things,
  Dropt from the ruined sides of kings.
  Here's a world of pomp and state,
  Buried in dust, once dead by fate.

                                    _Beaumont._

  GOING A-MAYING


  Get up, get up for shame! The blooming morn
  Upon her wings presents the god unshorn:
      See how Aurora throws her fair
      Fresh-quilted colours through the air:
      Get up, sweet slug-a-bed, and see
      The dew-bespangled herb and tree!
  Each flower has wept and bowed toward the east,
  Above an hour since, yet you not drest,
      Nay, not so much as out of bed?
      When all the birds have matins said,
      And sung their thankful hymns, 'tis sin,
      Nay, profanation, to keep in,
  Whenas a thousand virgins on this day
  Spring sooner than the lark to fetch in May.

  Rise, and put on your foliage, and be seen
  To come forth like the spring-time fresh and green,
      And sweet as Flora. Take no care
      For jewels for your gown or hair:
      Fear not; the leaves will strew
      Gems in abundance upon you:
  Besides, the childhood of the day has kept,
  Against you come, some orient pearls unwept.
      Come, and receive them while the light
      Hangs on the dew-locks of the night,
      And Titan on the eastern hill
      Retires himself, or else stands still
  Till you come forth! Wash, dress, be brief in praying:
  Few beads are best when once we go a-Maying.

  Come, my Corinna, come; and coming, mark
  How each field turns a street, each street a park,
      Made green and trimmed with trees! see how
      Devotion gives each house a bough
      Or branch! each porch, each door, ere this,
      An ark, a tabernacle is,
  Made up of white-thorn neatly interwove,
  As if here were those cooler shades of love.
      Can such delights be in the street
      And open fields, and we not see 't?
      Come, we'll abroad: and let's obey
      The proclamation made for May,
  And sin no more, as we have done, by staying,
  But, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying.

  There's not a budding boy or girl this day,
  But is got up and gone to bring in May.
      A deal of youth ere this is come
      Back and with white-thorn laden home.
      Some have despatched their cakes and cream,
      Before that we have left to dream:
  And some have wept and wooed, and plighted troth,
  And chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth:
      Many a green-gown has been given,
      Many a kiss, both odd and even:
      Many a glance too has been sent
      From out the eye, love's firmament:
  Many a jest told of the keys betraying
  This night, and locks picked: yet we're not a-Maying.

  Come, let us go, while we are in our prime,
  And take the harmless folly of the time!
      We shall grow old apace, and die
      Before we know our liberty.
      Our life is short, and our days run
      As fast away as does the sun.
  And, as a vapour or a drop of rain,
  Once lost can ne'er be found again,
      So when or you or I are made
      A fable, song, or fleeting shade,
      All love, all liking, all delight,
      Lies drowned with us in endless night.
  Then, while time serves, and we are but decaying,
  Come, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying.

  TO ANTHEA

  WHO MAY COMMAND HIM ANYTHING


  Bid me to live, and I will live
    Thy Protestant to be;
  Or bid me love and I will give
    A loving heart to thee.

  A heart as soft, a heart as kind,
    A heart as sound and free,
  As in the whole world thou canst find,
    That heart I'll give to thee.

  Bid that heart stay, and it will stay
    To honour thy decree;
  Or bid it languish quite away,
    And 't shall do so for thee.

  Bid me to weep, and I will weep
    While I have eyes to see;
  And, having none, yet I will keep
    A heart to weep for thee.

  Bid me despair, and I'll despair
    Under that cypress-tree;
  Or bid me die, and I will dare
    E'en death to die for thee.

  Thou art my life, my love, my heart,
    The very eyes of me,
  And hast command of every part,
    To live and die for thee.

                                    _Herrick._

  MEMENTO MORI


  Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright--
  The bridal of the earth and sky--
  The dew shall weep thy fall to-night,
          For thou must die.

  Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,
  Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,
  Thy root is ever in its grave,
          And thou must die.

  Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,
  A box where sweets compacted lie,
  My music shows ye have your closes,
          And all must die.

  Only a sweet and virtuous soul
  Like seasoned timber never gives,
  But, though the whole world turn to coal,
          Then chiefly lives.

                                    _Herbert._

  THE KING OF KINGS


  The glories of our birth and state
    Are shadows, not substantial things:
  There is no armour against fate:
    Death lays his icy hand on kings:
          Sceptre and crown
          Must tumble down,
  And in the dust be equal made
  With the poor crookèd scythe and spade.

  Some men with swords may reap the field,
    And plant fresh laurels when they kill,
  But their strong nerves at last must yield:
    They tame but one another still.
          Early or late
          They stoop to fate,
  And must give up their murmuring breath
  When they, pale captives, creep to death.

  The garlands wither on their brow--
    Then boast no more your mighty deeds!
  Upon Death's purple altar now
    See where the victor-victim bleeds!
          All heads must come
          To the cold tomb:
  Only the actions of the just
  Smell sweet, and blossom in their dust.

                                    _Shirley._


  XI

  LYCIDAS


  Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more,
  Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,
  I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,
  And with forced fingers rude
  Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.
  Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear,
  Compels me to disturb your season due:
  For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,
  Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer:
  Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew
  Himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme.
  He must not float upon his watery bier
  Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,
  Without the meed of some melodious tear.
    Begin, then, sisters of the sacred well,
  That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring;
  Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string;
  Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse:
  So may some gentle Muse
  With lucky words favour my destined urn,
  And, as he passes, turn
  And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud!
    For we were nursed upon the selfsame hill,
  Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill.
  Together both, ere the high lawns appeared
  Under the opening eyelids of the morn,
  We drove afield, and both together heard
  What time the grey-fly winds her sultry horn
  Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,
  Oft till the star that rose at evening bright
  Towards heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.
  Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,
  Tempered to the oaten flute;
  Rough satyrs danced, and fauns with cloven heel
  From the glad sound would not be absent long;
  And old Damoetas loved to hear our song.
    But O the heavy change, now thou art gone,
  Now thou art gone, and never must return!
  Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods, and desert caves
  With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown,
  And all their echoes, mourn.
  The willows and the hazel copses green
  Shall now no more be seen
  Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays,
  As killing as the canker to the rose,
  Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,
  Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear
  When first the white-thorn blows,
  Such, Lycidas, thy loss to Shepherds' ear.
    Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep
  Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?
  For neither were ye playing on the steep
  Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,
  Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,
  Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream:
  Ay me! I fondly dream
  'Had ye been there,' ... for what could that have done?
  What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,
  The Muse herself, for her enchanting son
  Whom universal nature did lament,
  When by the rout that made the hideous roar
  His gory visage down the stream was sent,
  Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?
    Alas! what boots it with incessant care
  To tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade,
  And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?
  Were it not better done, as others use,
  To sport with Amaryllis in the shade
  Or with the tangles of Neæra's hair?
  Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
  (That last infirmity of noble mind)
  To scorn delights and live laborious days;
  But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,
  And think to burst out into sudden blaze,
  Comes the blind Fury with the abhorrèd shears,
  And slits the thin-spun life. 'But not the praise,'
  Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears:
  'Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,
  Nor in the glistering foil
  Set off to the world nor in broad rumour lies,
  But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
  And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;
  As he pronounces lastly on each deed,
  Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.'
    O fountain Arethuse, and thou honoured flood,
  Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,
  That strain I heard was of a higher mood!
  But now my oat proceeds,
  And listens to the Herald of the Sea
  That came in Neptune's plea.
  He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,
  What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?
  And questioned every gust of rugged wings
  That blows from off each beakèd promontory:
  They knew not of his story,
  And sage Hippotades their answer brings,
  That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed:
  The air was calm, and on the level brine
  Sleek Panope with all her sisters played.
  It was that fatal and perfidious bark,
  Built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark,
  That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
