THE DOG'S DINNER PARTY.


Mr. Blenheim was a very gentlemanly dog, and Mrs. Blenheim was quite
the lady; both were well-bred, handsome, and fond of good company. They
lived in a nice house, by Hyde Park Corner. Now Mr. Blenheim was one
day in the library, dozing in his arm-chair after dinner, when Mrs. B.
thus addressed him:

"Rouse up, Blenny dear, and tell me about these notes of invitation for
our dinner-party."

"I am rather sleepy," said he, "so you must read the list over to me."

Mrs. B. read the names of Mr. Tan-Terrier, Mr. Fox-Hound, Mr. Dane, Mr.
Mastiff, Mr. Beagle, Mr. Poodle, Mr. Barker--Mr. Bull-Dog concluding
the list. "Mr. Bull-Dog!" cried Mrs. B., looking vexed, "why do you ask
him? no one considers him respectable."

"It will not do to leave him out, dear!" said Mr. Blenheim, who then
got up, and went lazily to the desk to write the invitations.

Pug, the Page, went to Kennel Court, the country box of Mr. Fox-Hound,
and found that sporting character near home, wiping his brow after a
good hunt. His manners were more blunt than his teeth, and his loud
voice could be heard miles off. He was called a "jolly dog," and seldom
dined alone. But his great delight was the chase of a fox; he could
then hardly give tongue enough to express his joy. After asking Pug
after Mrs. Blenheim's health, he accepted the invitation.

Florio, the Courier, waited on Mr. Barker with his note of invitation.
Mr. Barker lived in a snug little house, in a farmyard, where he had
the charge of watching over and protecting the live stock. He at first
feared he must decline the invitation, but, on second thoughts, he
resolved to venture; it was not a late dinner, and he would manage to
get away early. Unluckily, his coat was rather the worse for wear, but
he could boast of a handsome collar at any rate,--and so he accepted.

When Pug, the Page, reached the dwelling-place of Mr. Bull-Dog, he
found him lying close to a bit of an old tub, in a dirty yard, smoking
a short pipe very coolly. Mr. Bull-Dog snarled a little at being
disturbed, and then read the note. "Oh, you can say I'll be sure to
come," said he, "I am always ready for a good feed. Now, young one,"
said he to Pug, with a growl, "I advise you to cut away as fast as you
can!"

At last the day of the grand dinner-party arrived, and the guests all
assembled, in good spirits, with keen appetites for the feast. Never
had so many sleek, well-dressed dogs met together before, and the
variety of their coats and countenances was very striking. All were,
in compliment to the gentle hostess, Mrs. Blenheim, on their best
behaviour, and great was the harmony that prevailed. Ample justice,
too, was done to the good things liberally provided for their
entertainment; and, strange to say, for so large a party and so mixed
a company, no excess was committed either in eating or drinking.
Social chat was the order of the day; compliments were exchanged;
toasts, praising every guest in turn, were proposed and received with
cordiality; speeches were made, which were applauded even when not
called for or understood; and for a long time it seemed that no Lord
Mayor's feast could have passed off more brilliantly, or have given
greater satisfaction.

Mr. Bull-Dog was, however, missing from among the guests after a time;
it seems that he found the sports rather dull, and so had sneaked off.
Presently a great uproar was heard; and it was found that he had gone
below, and had eaten up all the servants' dinner; so they all joined
together to punish him, and after some trouble, contrived to kick him
out of the house; and very foolish he looked, in spite of his tipsy
swagger.

As Mr. Bull-Dog had lost his pipe in the street, he thought he would
turn into a public-house to get another: here he again misbehaved, and
was soon turned out; some mischievous boys then got hold of him, tied
an old tin saucepan to his tail, and chased him through the streets.
The faster he ran, the more he bumped himself with the saucepan; and
the more he yelled with pain, the more the boys pelted him with mud and
stones. At length he reached his dirty dwelling, more dead than alive.

Poor Mrs. Blenheim! she was, indeed, much to be pitied, to have her
nice dinner-party disturbed by so vulgar a creature. This shows how
careful we should be in avoiding low company.
