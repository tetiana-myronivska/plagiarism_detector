TO

REVEREND DANIEL J. QUINN, S.J.

The historical material here presented was gathered for my classes at
Fordham University School of Medicine during your term as president of
the University. It seems only fitting then, that when put into more
permanent form it should appear under the patronage of your name and
tell of my cordial appreciation of more than a quarter of a century of
valued friendship.


"When we have thoroughly mastered contemporary science it is time to
turn to past science; nothing fortifies the judgment more than this
comparative study; impartiality of mind is developed thereby, the
uncertainties of any system become manifest. The authority of facts is
there confirmed, and we discover in the whole picture a philosophic
teaching which is in itself a lesson; in other words, we learn to know,
to understand, and to judge."--LITTRÉ: _OEuvres
d'Hippocrate_, T. I, p. 477.

"There is not a single development, even the most advanced of
contemporary medicine, which is not to be found in embryo in the
medicine of the olden time."--LITTRÉ: Introduction to the Works
of Hippocrates.

"How true it is that in reading this history one finds modern
discoveries that are anything but discoveries, unless one supposes that
they have been made twice."--DUJARDIN: _Histoire de la
Chirurgie_, Paris, 1774 (quoted by Gurlt on the post title-page of his
_Geschichte der Chirurgie_, Berlin, 1898).


PREFACE


The material for this book was gathered partly for lectures on the
history of medicine at Fordham University School of Medicine, and partly
for articles on a number of subjects in the Catholic Encyclopedia. Some
of it was developed for a series of addresses at commencements of
medical schools and before medical societies, on the general topic how
old the new is in surgery, medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy. The
information thus presented aroused so much interest, the accomplishments
of the physicians and surgeons of a period that is usually thought quite
sterile in medical science proved, indeed, so astonishing, that I was
tempted to connect the details for a volume in the Fordham University
Press series. There is no pretence to any original investigation in the
history of medicine, nor to any extended consultation of original
documents. I have had most of the great books that are mentioned in the
course of this volume in my hands, and have given as much time to the
study of them as could be afforded in the midst of a rather busy life,
but I owe my information mainly to the distinguished German and French
scholars who have in recent years made deep and serious studies of these
Old Makers of Medicine, and I have made my acknowledgments to them in
the text as opportunity presented itself.

There is just one feature of the book that may commend it to
present-day readers, and that is that our medieval medical colleagues,
when medicine embraced most of science, faced the problems of medicine
and surgery and the allied sciences that are now interesting us, in very
much the same temper of mind as we do, and very often anticipated our
solutions of them--much oftener, indeed, than most of us, unless we have
paid special attention to history, have any idea of. The volume does not
constitute, then, a contribution to that theme that has interested the
last few generations so much,--the supposed continuous progress of the
race and its marvellous advance,--but rather emphasizes that puzzling
question, how is it that men make important discoveries and inventions,
and then, after a time, forget about them so that they have to be made
over again? This is as true in medical science and in medical practice
as in every other department of human effort. It does not seem possible
that mankind should ever lose sight of the progress in medicine and
surgery that has been made in recent years, yet the history of the past
would seem to indicate that, in spite of its unlikelihood, it might well
come about. Whether this is the lesson of the book or not, I shall leave
readers to judge, for it was not intentionally put into it.

OUR LADY'S DAY IN HARVEST, 1911.

"Of making many books there is no end."--_Eccles._ xii, 12 (circa 1000
B.C.).


"The little by-play between Socrates and Euthydemus suggests an advanced
condition of medical literature: 'Of course, you who have so many books
are going in for being a doctor,' says Socrates, and then he adds,
'there are so many books on medicine, you know.' As Dyer remarks,
whatever the quality of these books may have been, their number must
have been great to give point to this chaff."--_Aequanimitas_,
WILLIAM OSLER, M.D., F.R.S., Blakistons, Philadelphia, 1906.


    "Augescunt aliae gentes, aliae minuuntur;
    Inque brevi spatio mutantur saecla animantum,
    Et, quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt."
                                            --OVID.


One nation rises to supreme power in the world, while another declines,
and, in a brief space of time, the sovereign people change,
transmitting, like racers, the lamp of life to some other that is to
succeed them.


"There is one Science of Medicine which is concerned with the inspection
of health equally in all times, present, past and future."

--PLATO.
