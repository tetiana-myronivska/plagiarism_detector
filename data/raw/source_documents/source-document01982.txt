MAX.
                And think'st thou,
Dost thou believe, that thou wilt tear it from him?
Oh, never hope it! Father! father! father!
An inauspicious office is enjoined thee.
This paper here!--this! and wilt thou enforce it?
The mighty in the middle of his host,
Surrounded by his thousands, him wouldst thou
Disarm--degrade! Thou art lost, both thou and all of us.

OCTAVIO.
What hazard I incur thereby, I know.
In the great hand of God I stand. The Almighty
Will cover with his shield the imperial house,
And shatter, in his wrath, the work of darkness.
The emperor hath true servants still; and even
Here in the camp, there are enough brave men
Who for the good cause will fight gallantly.
The faithful have been warned--the dangerous
Are closely watched. I wait but the first step,
And then immediately----

Max.
            What? On suspicion?
Immediately?

OCTAVIO.
       The emperor is no tyrant.
The deed alone he'll punish, not the wish.
The duke hath yet his destiny in his power.
Let him but leave the treason uncompleted,
He will be silently displaced from office,
And make way to his emperor's royal son.
An honorable exile to his castles
Will be a benefaction to him rather
Than punishment. But the first open step----

MAX.
What callest thou such a step? A wicked step
Ne'er will he take; but thou mightest easily,
Yea, thou hast done it, misinterpret him.

OCTAVIO.
Nay, howsoever punishable were
Duke Friedland's purposes, yet still the steps
Which he hath taken openly permit
A mild construction. It is my intention
To leave this paper wholly unenforced
Till some act is committed which convicts him
Of high treason, without doubt or plea,
And that shall sentence him.

MAX.
               But who the judge

OCTAVIO.
Thyself.

MAX.
     Forever, then, this paper will lie idle.

OCTAVIO.
Too soon, I fear, its powers must all be proved.
After the counter-promise of this evening,
It cannot be but he must deem himself
Secure of the majority with us;
And of the army's general sentiment
He hath a pleasing proof in that petition,
Which thou delivered'st to him from the regiments.
Add this too--I have letters that the Rhinegrave
Hath changed his route, and travels by forced marches
To the Bohemian forests. What this purports
Remains unknown; and, to confirm suspicion,
This night a Swedish nobleman arrived here.

MAX.
I have thy word. Thou'lt not proceed to action
Before thou hast convinced me--me myself.

OCTAVIO.
Is it possible? Still, after all thou know'st,
Canst thou believe still in his innocence?

MAX. (with enthusiasm).
Thy judgment may mistake; my heart cannot.
      [Moderates his voice and manner.
These reasons might expound thy spirit or mine;
But they expound not Friedland--I have faith:
For as he knits his fortunes to the stars,
Even so doth he resemble them in secret,
Wonderful, still inexplicable courses!
Trust me, they do him wrong. All will be solved.
These smokes at once will kindle into flame--
The edges of this black and stormy cloud
Will brighten suddenly, and we shall view
The unapproachable glide out in splendor.

OCTAVIO.
I will await it.


SCENE II.

   OCTAVIO and MAX. as before. To then the VALET OF
   THE CHAMBER.

OCTAVIO.
How now, then?

VALET.
        A despatch is at the door.

OCTAVIO.
So early? From whom comes he then? Who is it?

VALET.
That he refused to tell me.

OCTAVIO.
               Lead him in:
And, hark you--let it not transpire.

     [Exit VALET: the CORNET steps in.

OCTAVIO.
Ha! cornet--is it you; and from Count Gallas?
Give me your letters.

CORNET.
            The lieutenant-general
Trusted it not to letters.

OCTAVIO.
              And what is it?

CORNET.
He bade me tell you--Dare I speak openly here?

OCTAVIO.
My son knows all.

CORNET.
          We have him.

OCTAVIO.
                 Whom?

CORNET.
                    Sesina,
The old negotiator.
