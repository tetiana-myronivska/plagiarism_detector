The side which "calls" takes all of the States in a box. When "time" is
called by the "reply" side, the "calls" must put a State on the table, and
the "replys" must name it and give the position it occupies before the
time-keeper of the "calls" can count 25; if the name or position is not
correctly given, the "calls" must themselves name the State and its
position, and place it on the table in about the position it will occupy
when all the pieces are in place; if they do this, they score.

For instance: The State of Massachusetts is put out, and the "replys" name
it "Massachusetts--Northeastern part," and count one. This is continued
until the entire map is complete.

As maps may be obtained which have the Great Lakes also cut out, it is
great fun to see the mistakes made.

The "calls" or "replys" will frequently in playing it turn a state upside
down; this counts against the side making the mistake.

The game may be varied by putting one State on the table and calling for
"next North," "next South," "next East," etc., when the name of the State
occupying that position must be correctly given.

The side having the greatest number of points wins the game.
