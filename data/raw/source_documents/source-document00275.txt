In this peaceful manner my adventures ended, and I found myself, far
beyond my deserts, settled at last in the land where I was born, among
those who loved me and whom I loved.

And we are so made, and this life of ours is so strange a thing, that
sometimes, when I walk abroad in the evening, as I was wont to do in
my boyhood, and stand beside the lonely, rippling water of the broad,
and watch the reflection of the sunset upon the distant walls of
Yarmouth town; sometimes, I say, I ask myself whether all this has
really been as I have thus written it, or whether all these events
from my first running away from my father's roof; and those nights and
days in the streets of yonder town and beneath the roof of the old
"Three-decker"; and the woman I loved and fought for; and my cousin
Rupert's enmity; and the voyage which I took to the East Indies, and
the battles and perils which I passed through; and last of all that
white tomb in the seraglio garden in far-off Moorshedabad; whether
they are not dreams and visions which have come to me while I have
slept.
