she cries in sham deprecation, but all the while she "winks the other
eye" in a way her hearers quite understand. "Cabby knows his fare,"
and the Music-hall Muse knows her clients. What, we wonder, would
be her reception did she really carry out her ironically pretended
protest and sing to the chuckling cads who applaud her, the following
version of her favourite lay?

NO. II.--THE WINK OF ROGUERY'S EYE.

AIR--"_WINK THE OTHER EYE_."

  Say, boys, whatever do men mean
  When they wink the other eye?
  Why, when "sharps" say the world is "green,"
  Do they wink the other eye?
  The Radicals and Tories both tell stories, not a few,
  About Measures falsely promised, and reforms long overdue;
  And when the simple Mob believes that every word is true.
  Then they--wink the other eye!

    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, now is it quite the thing!
        Say, should we let them have their fling?
        Ah, when they get us "on a string"
        Then they wink the other eye!

  Say, boys are Leaders to be loved,
  When they wink the other eye?
  By artful speech the Mob is moved,
  Till _it_ winks the other eye;
  The optic Wink's the language of the sly and sordid soul,
  The mute freemasonry of Fraud, sign-post to Roguery's goal.
  When Circe sees her votaries swine ready in sludge to roll
  Then _she_ winks the other eye!

    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, _is_ it so fine a thing,
        Low Cunning, which Cheat's laureates sing,
        The Comus of the Mart and Ring,
        Who--winks the other eye?

  Say, boys, is Cunning's promise good,
  When she winks the other eye?
  Noodledom seeks her neighbourhood,
  And winks _its_ other eye.
  For no one winks so freely as a fool who _thinks_ he's sly;
  The dupe of deeper knavery smirks in shallow mimicry
  Of the smirking JERRY DIDDLER who is sucking him so dry,
  And who winks the other eye.

    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, now is the Wink a thing
        Worthy of worship; will you fling
        Your caps in air for the Knave-King
        Who--winks the other eye?

  The Politician plucks his geese,
  Then he winks the other eye.
  Brazen Fraud steals Trade's Golden Fleece,
  Then he winks the other eye.
  _Autolycus_ pipes ballads; public pockets are his aim;
  _Rabagas_ raves of "liberty"; advancement is his game;
  And when their dupes aren't looking all these rogues do just the same,
  They--wink the other eye!

    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, pæans will you sing
        To winking harpies all a-wing
        To prey on fools; who steal, and sting,
        And--wink the other eye?

  Wisdom may smile, but Cunning can't,
  She winks the other eye.
  Humour shall chortle, Mockery shan't,
  She winks the other eye.
  The stars above us twinkle and the dews beneath us blink,
  All the eyes of Nature sparkle, and from merriment do not shrink,
  The Language of the Eye of Cynic Knavery is--the Wink!
  _Roguery_ "winks the other eye!"

    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, is it quite the thing?
        "Ducdàme"[1] to fools the Diddlers sing;
        Trust me 'tis Rascals in a Ring
        Who wink the other eye!

[Footnote 1:

  _Amiens_. What's that "ducdàme"?

  _Jaques_. 'Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle.

THE EVOLUTION OF TOMMY'S PRIVATE-SCHOOL REPORT.

1. _A rough draught, written by the under-master, who certainly has
had rather a trying week with_ TOMMY.

"I am unable to speak highly of either his intelligence or his
industry; but occasionally he works well, and has undoubtedly made
some progress this term. His conduct is not always good."

2. _Second rough draught_; TOMMY _in the meantime has missed a
repetition and accidentally knocked down the black-board._
