Altogether the experiences gained amply repaid me for the effort spent.
These visits to the silent ones were payments ample enough in
themselves, but my closer acquaintance with a very interesting family
made them doubly so. I find that the owl is one of our best and most
valuable friends, destroying during a season much of the troublesome
animal population that injures the agricultural interests of the land.
If careless boys and indifferent "others" could get this fact well
grounded and use some other mark in target practice, all parties would
be better off and much good gained. To take any life is ill, but to
take good life is crime.

    THE JAYS.


    "I know an old man,
      His name is Jay,
    He wears a blue coat,
      And a hat of gray.

    He has a nice nest
      High up in a tree,
    Where sits his dear mate
      Content as can be.

    There are four blue eggs
      In the little brown nest,
    Which will soon be baby birds
      Blue, like the rest."


    ADDRESS OF THE BIRDS.

    AN EXERCISE FOR FIVE PUPILS.


    _The Robin_--

    "I am a robin, very brown
    And big and plump and smooth and round.
    My breast is pretty, bright and red
    And see this top-knot on my head!
    I heard the boys awhile ago
    Shooting robins o'er the snow,
    And flew away in trembling fear
    And thought I'd hide from them in here.

    _The Blue Bird_--

    I'm a blue bird. Don't you see
    Me sitting on this apple-tree,
    I left my nest an hour ago
    To look for bugs and worms, you know;
    And now I know the very thing--
    That while I'm waiting I will sing,
    Oh! beautiful and balmy spring.

    _The Woodpecker_--

    I'm a woodpecker--a bird
    Whose sound through wood and dale is heard.
    I tap, tap, tap, with noisy glee,
    To test the bark of every tree.
    I saw a rainbow stretching gay,
    Across the sky, the other day;
    And some one said, "Good-bye to rain,
    The woodpecker has come again."

    _The Lark_--

    I'm the lark and early rise
    To greet the sun-god of the skies,
    And upright cleave the freshening air,
    To sail in regions still more fair.
    Who could not soar on lusty wing,
    His Maker's praises thus to sing?

    _The Nightingale_--

    In music I excel the lark,
    She comes at dawn, I come at dark,
    And when the stars are shining bright,
    I sing the praises of the night.

    _In Concert_--

    Oh! in a chorus sweet we'll sing,
    And wake the echoes of the spring."


    LITTLE BY LITTLE.


    "Little by little," the acorn said,
    As it slowly sank in its mossy bed,
    "I am improving every day,
    Hidden deep in the earth away."
    Little by little each day it grew;
    Little by little it sipped the dew;
    Downward it sent out a threadlike root;
    Up in the air sprung a tiny shoot,
    Day after day, and year after year,
    Little by little the leaves appear;
    And the slender branches spread far and wide,
    Till the mighty oak is the forest's pride.

    "Little by little," said the thoughtful boy,
    "Moment by moment, I'll well employ,
    Learning a little every day,
    And not misspending my time in play;
    Whatever I do I will do it well.
    Little by little, I'll learn to know
    The treasured wisdom of long ago;
    And one of these days, perhaps, will see
    That the world will be the better for me."

    A LITTLE POLLYWOG.


    "A tiny little pollywog,
      And little brothers three,
    Lived in the water near a log,
      As happy as could be.
    A-swimming, swimming all the day,
      A-sleeping all the night,
    And trying, though they were so gay,
      To do just what was right;
    A-growing, growing all the while,
      Because they did their best;
    But I am afraid that you will smile
      When I tell you the rest.

    One morning, sitting on the log,
      They looked in mute surprise;
    Four legs had every pollywog,
      Where two had met their eyes.
    Their mother, letting fall a tear,
      Said, "Oh, my pollywogs,
    It can't be you that sitting here!"
      For all of them were frogs.
    And with their legs they've grown some lungs;
      So you just wait and see.
    In summer time their little tongues
      Will sing 'Kachink' with glee."

    --_School Education._


    AN ARBOR DAY TREE.


    Dear little tree that we plant today
    What will you be when we're old and gray?
    "The savings bank of the squirrel and mouse,
    For robin and wren an apartment house,
    The dressing-room of the butterfly's ball,
    The locust's and katydid's concert hall,
    The school-boy's ladder in pleasant June,
    The school-girl's tent in the July noon.
    And my leaves shall whisper them merrily,
    A tale of the children who planted me."

    --_From The Intelligence._


    THE ROBIN AND THE FLOWER.


    A Robin once sat in the bright winter's sun,
        A foolish red robin was he,
    For he sang a sweet song that springtime had come
        When the day was as cold as could be.

    So gay was his song of the warmth of the hour,
        So merrily babbled the sound,
    That it stole through the dream of a dear little flower
        Who was slumbering under the ground.

    The sleeper awakened, soft lifted the sod
        And harkened the robin's sweet song,
    Full glad was her heart and thankful to God
        That winter so quickly had gone.

    The robin still sang and the dear little flower
        Unfolded her petals of pink:--
    "I'll hold up my chalice," she said, "for a shower
        That from me my robin may drink."

    The singer flew quickly to welcome his love,--
        His love that was faltering low:--
    Oh, where was the warmth from the heaven above?
        Instead of a shower there was snow.

    Then robin quick covered her o'er with his wing,
        "Don't leave me, I love you," he cried:
    And he kissed her so tenderly, poor little thing,
        But the blossom, his loved one, had died.

    Red robin still sits in the bright winter's sun,
        But a sorrowing robin is he;
    No longer he sings that the springtime has come
        When the day is as cold as can be.

    --_Charles A. Myall._


    Give fools their gold and knaves their power;
      Let fortune's bubbles rise and fall;
    Who sows a field, or trains a flower
      Or plants a tree is more than all.
    For he who blesses most is blest;
      And God and man shall own his worth
    Who toils to leave as his bequest
      An added beauty to the earth.

    --_Whittier._

    THE CATBIRD.


    He sits on the branch of yon blossoming tree,
        This mad-cap cousin of Robin and Thrush,
    And sings without ceasing the whole morning long;
        Now wild, now tender, the wayward song
    That flows from his soft gray, fluttering throat;
        But oft he stops in his sweetest note,
    And shaking a flower from the blossoming bough,
        Drawls out: "Mi-eu, mi-ow!"

    --_Edith M. Thomas._




    THE MOCKING BIRD.


    He didn't know much music
        When first he come along;
    An' all the birds went wonderin'
        Why he didn't sing a song.

    They primed their feathers in the sun,
        An' sung their sweetest notes;
    An' music jest come on the run
        From all their purty throats!

    But still that bird was silent
        In summer time an' fall;
    He jest set still an' listened
        An' he wouldn't sing at all!

    But one night when them songsters
        Was tired out an' still,
    An' the wind sighed down the valley
        An' went creepin' up the hill;

    When the stars was all a-tremble
        In the dreamin' fields o' blue,
    An' the daisy in the darkness
        Felt the fallin' o' the dew,--

    There come a sound o' melody
        No mortal ever heard,
    An' all the birds seemed singin'
        From the throat o' one sweet bird!

    Then the other birds went playin'
        In a land too fur to call;
    Fer there warn't no use in stayin'
        When one bird could sing fer all!

    --_Frank L. Stanton._
