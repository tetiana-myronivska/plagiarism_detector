Book 03 Leviticus
001:001 Yahweh called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the Tent
        of Meeting, saying,
001:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When anyone
        of you offers an offering to Yahweh, you shall offer your
        offering of the livestock, from the herd and from the flock.
001:003 "'If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall
        offer a male without blemish.  He shall offer it at the door
        of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before Yahweh.
001:004 He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering,
        and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
001:005 He shall kill the bull before Yahweh.  Aaron's sons, the priests,
        shall present the blood and sprinkle the blood around on
        the altar that is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
001:006 He shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into pieces.
001:007 The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar,
        and lay wood in order on the fire;
001:008 and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head,
        and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire which is
        on the altar;
001:009 but its innards and its legs he shall wash with water.
        The priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt offering,
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
001:010 "'If his offering is from the flock, from the sheep,
        or from the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer
        a male without blemish.
001:011 He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before Yahweh.
        Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood around
        on the altar.
001:012 He shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat.
        The priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on
        the fire which is on the altar,
001:013 but the innards and the legs he shall wash with water.
        The priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on the altar.
        It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet
        savor to Yahweh.
001:014 "'If his offering to Yahweh is a burnt offering of birds,
        then he shall offer his offering of turtledoves,
        or of young pigeons.
001:015 The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head,
        and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be drained
        out on the side of the altar;
001:016 and he shall take away its crop with its filth, and cast it
        beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes.
001:017 He shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it apart.
        The priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on
        the fire.  It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
002:001 "'When anyone offers an offering of a meal offering to Yahweh,
        his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it,
        and put frankincense on it.
002:002 He shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall
        take his handful of its fine flour, and of its oil,
        with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn
        the memorial of it on the altar, an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
002:003 That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's
        and his sons'.  It is a most holy thing of the offerings
        of Yahweh made by fire.
002:004 "'When you offer an offering of a meal offering baked in the oven,
        it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil,
        or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
002:005 If your offering is a meal offering of the baking pan,
        it shall be of unleavened fine flour, mixed with oil.
002:006 You shall cut it in pieces, and pour oil on it.
        It is a meal offering.
002:007 If your offering is a meal offering of the frying pan,
        it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
002:008 You shall bring the meal offering that is made of these things
        to Yahweh:  and it shall be presented to the priest,
        and he shall bring it to the altar.
002:009 The priest shall take from the meal offering its memorial,
        and shall burn it on the altar, an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
002:010 That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's
        and his sons'.  It is a thing most holy of the offerings
        of Yahweh made by fire.
002:011 "'No meal offering, which you shall offer to Yahweh, shall be
        made with yeast; for you shall burn no yeast, nor any honey,
        as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
002:012 As an offering of firstfruits you shall offer them to Yahweh:
        but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.
002:013 Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt;
        neither shall you allow the salt of the covenant of your God
        to be lacking from your meal offering.  With all your offerings
        you shall offer salt.
002:014 "'If you offer a meal offering of first fruits to Yahweh,
        you shall offer for the meal offering of your first fruits grain
        in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.
002:015 You shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it:
        it is a meal offering.
002:016 The priest shall burn as its memorial, part of its bruised grain,
        and part of its oil, along with all its frankincense:
        it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
003:001 "'If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings;
        if he offers it from the herd, whether male or female,
        he shall offer it without blemish before Yahweh.
003:002 He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill
        it at the door of the tent of meeting:  and Aaron's sons
        the priests shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.
003:003 He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering
        made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the innards,
        and all the fat that is on the innards,
003:004 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is
        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,
        he shall take away.
003:005 Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar on the burnt offering,
        which is on the wood that is on the fire:  it is an offering
        made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
003:006 "'If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to
        Yahweh is from the flock; male or female, he shall offer
        it without blemish.
003:007 If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer
        it before Yahweh;
003:008 and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering,
        and kill it before the tent of meeting:  and Aaron's sons
        shall sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.
003:009 He shall offer from the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering
        made by fire to Yahweh; its fat, the entire tail fat, he shall
        take away close to the backbone; and the fat that covers
        the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,
003:010 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is
        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,
        he shall take away.
003:011 The priest shall burn it on the altar:  it is the food
        of the offering made by fire to Yahweh.
003:012 "'If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before Yahweh:
003:013 and he shall lay his hand on its head, and kill it before
        the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle
        its blood on the altar round about.
003:014 He shall offer from it as his offering, an offering made by fire
        to Yahweh; the fat that covers the innards, and all the fat
        that is on the innards,
003:015 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is
        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,
        he shall take away.
003:016 The priest shall burn them on the altar:  it is the food
        of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor;
        all the fat is Yahweh's.
003:017 "'It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations
        in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood.'"
004:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
004:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If anyone
        sins unintentionally, in any of the things which Yahweh has
        commanded not to be done, and does any one of them:
004:003 if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people,
        then let him offer for his sin, which he has sinned, a young
        bull without blemish to Yahweh for a sin offering.
004:004 He shall bring the bull to the door of the Tent of Meeting
        before Yahweh; and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull,
        and kill the bull before Yahweh.
004:005 The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull,
        and bring it to the Tent of Meeting.
004:006 The priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
        some of the blood seven times before Yahweh, before the veil
        of the sanctuary.
004:007 The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar
        of sweet incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting;
        and he shall pour out all of rest of the blood of the bull at
        the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door
        of the Tent of Meeting.
004:008 He shall take all the fat of the bull of the sin offering
        off of it; the fat that covers the innards, and all the fat
        that is on the innards,
004:009 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is
        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,
        he shall take away,
004:010 as it is taken off of the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings.
        The priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
004:011 The bull's skin, all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs,
        its innards, and its dung,
004:012 even the whole bull shall he carry forth outside the camp
        to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn
        it on wood with fire.  Where the ashes are poured out it
        shall be burned.
004:013 "'If the whole congregation of Israel sins, and the thing
        is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done
        any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done,
        and are guilty;
004:014 when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly
        shall offer a young bull for a sin offering, and bring it
        before the Tent of Meeting.
004:015 The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on
        the head of the bull before Yahweh; and the bull shall be
        killed before Yahweh.
004:016 The anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bull
        to the Tent of Meeting:
004:017 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
        it seven times before Yahweh, before the veil.
004:018 He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar
        which is before Yahweh, that is in the Tent of Meeting;
        and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base
        of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of
        the Tent of Meeting.
004:019 All its fat he shall take from it, and burn it on the altar.
004:020 Thus shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull
        of the sin offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest
        shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
004:021 He shall carry forth the bull outside the camp, and burn
        it as he burned the first bull.  It is the sin offering
        for the assembly.
004:022 "'When a ruler sins, and unwittingly does any one of all
        the things which Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done,
        and is guilty;
004:023 if his sin, in which he has sinned, is made known to him,
        he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish.
004:024 He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it
        in the place where they kill the burnt offering before Yahweh.
        It is a sin offering.
004:025 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with
        his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering.
        He shall pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar
        of burnt offering.
004:026 All its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of
        the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall make
        atonement for him concerning his sin, and he will be forgiven.
004:027 "'If anyone of the common people sins unwittingly, in doing
        any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done,
        and is guilty;
004:028 if his sin, which he has sinned, is made known to him,
        then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female
        without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned.
004:029 He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering,
        and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering.
004:030 The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger,
        and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering;
        and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base
        of the altar.
004:031 All its fat he shall take away, like the fat is taken
        away from off of the sacrifice of peace offerings;
        and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet savor
        to Yahweh; and the priest shall make atonement for him,
        and he will be forgiven.
004:032 "'If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering,
        he shall bring a female without blemish.
004:033 He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering,
        and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill
        the burnt offering.
004:034 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with
        his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering;
        and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base
        of the altar.
004:035 All its fat he shall take away, like the fat of the lamb is taken
        away from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall
        burn them on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire;
        and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin
        that he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.
005:001 "'If anyone sins, in that he hears the voice of adjuration,
        he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he doesn't
        report it, then he shall bear his iniquity.
005:002 "'Or if anyone touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass
        of an unclean animal, or the carcass of unclean livestock,
        or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it is hidden
        from him, and he is unclean, then he shall be guilty.
005:003 "'Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness
        is with which he is unclean, and it is hidden from him;
        when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty.
005:004 "'Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil,
        or to do good, whatever it is that a man might utter rashly
        with an oath, and it is hidden from him; when he knows of it,
        then he shall be guilty of one of these.
005:005 It shall be, when he is guilty of one of these, he shall
        confess that in which he has sinned:
005:006 and he shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh for his sin
        which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat,
        for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement
        for him concerning his sin.
005:007 "'If he can't afford a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass
        offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves,
        or two young pigeons, to Yahweh; one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering.
005:008 He shall bring them to the priest, who shall first offer
        the one which is for the sin offering, and wring off its head
        from its neck, but shall not sever it completely.
005:009 He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on
        the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be
        drained out at the base of the altar.  It is a sin offering.
005:010 He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to
        the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him
        concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
005:011 "'But if he can't afford two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
        then he shall bring his offering for that in which he has sinned,
        the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.
        He shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense
        on it, for it is a sin offering.
005:012 He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take
        his handful of it as the memorial portion, and burn it
        on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.
        It is a sin offering.
005:013 The priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin that
        he has sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven;
        and the rest shall be the priest's, as the meal offering.'"
005:014 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
005:015 "If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unwittingly,
        in the holy things of Yahweh; then he shall bring his trespass
        offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock,
        according to your estimation in silver by shekels,
        after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.
005:016 He shall make restitution for that which he has done wrong
        in the holy thing, and shall add a fifth part to it,
        and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make
        atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering,
        and he will be forgiven.
005:017 "If anyone sins, and does any of the things which Yahweh
        has commanded not to be done; though he didn't know it,
        yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
005:018 He shall bring a ram without blemish from of the flock,
        according to your estimation, for a trespass offering,
        to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him
        concerning the thing in which he sinned and didn't know it,
        and he will be forgiven.
005:019 It is a trespass offering.  He is certainly guilty before Yahweh."
006:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:002 "If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against Yahweh,
        and deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit,
        or of bargain, or of robbery, or has oppressed his neighbor,
006:003 or has found that which was lost, and dealt falsely therein,
        and swearing to a lie; in any of all these things that a
        man does, sinning therein;
006:004 then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, he shall
        restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has
        gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him,
        or the lost thing which he found,
006:005 or any thing about which he has sworn falsely; he shall restore
        it even in full, and shall add a fifth part more to it.
        To him to whom it belongs he shall give it, in the day of his
        being found guilty.
006:006 He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh, a ram without
        blemish from the flock, according to your estimation,
        for a trespass offering, to the priest.
006:007 The priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will
        be forgiven concerning whatever he does to become guilty."
006:008 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:009 "Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law
        of the burnt offering:  the burnt offering shall be on
        the hearth on the altar all night until the morning;
        and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
006:010 The priest shall put on his linen garment, and he shall put
        on his linen breeches upon his body; and he shall remove
        the ashes from where the fire has consumed the burnt offering
        on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
006:011 He shall take off his garments, and put on other garments,
        and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
006:012 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not
        go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning:
        and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it,
        and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
006:013 Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually;
        it shall not go out.
006:014 "'This is the law of the meal offering:  the sons of Aaron
        shall offer it before Yahweh, before the altar.
006:015 He shall take from there his handful of the fine flour of
        the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense
        which is on the meal offering, and shall burn it on the altar
        for a sweet savor, as its memorial, to Yahweh.
006:016 That which is left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat.
        It shall be eaten without yeast in a holy place.
        They shall eat it in the court of the Tent of Meeting
006:017 It shall not be baked with yeast.  I have given it as their
        portion of my offerings made by fire.  It is most holy,
        as the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.
006:018 Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it,
        as their portion forever throughout your generations,
        from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.  Whoever touches
        them shall be holy.'"
006:019 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:020 "This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
        shall offer to Yahweh in the day when he is anointed:
        the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal
        offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half
        of it in the evening.
006:021 It shall be made with oil in a baking pan.  When it is soaked,
        you shall bring it in.  You shall offer the meal offering
        in baked pieces for a sweet savor to Yahweh.
006:022 The anointed priest that will be in his place from among his
        sons shall offer it.  By a statute forever, it shall be wholly
        burnt to Yahweh.
006:023 Every meal offering of a priest shall be wholly burned.
        It shall not be eaten."
006:024 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:025 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law
        of the sin offering:  in the place where the burnt offering
        is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before Yahweh.
        It is most holy.
006:026 The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it.  It shall be
        eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
006:027 Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy.  When there
        is any of its blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash
        that on which it was sprinkled in a holy place.
006:028 But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken;
        and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured,
        and rinsed in water.
006:029 Every male among the priests shall eat of it:  it is most holy.
006:030 No sin offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent
        of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be eaten:
        it shall be burned with fire.
007:001 "'This is the law of the trespass offering.  It is most holy.
007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering, he shall
        kill the trespass offering; and its blood he shall sprinkle
        on the altar round about.
007:003 He shall offer all of its fat:  the fat tail, and the fat
        that covers the innards,
007:004 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is
        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,
        shall he take away;
007:005 and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering
        made by fire to Yahweh:  it is a trespass offering.
007:006 Every male among the priests may eat of it.  It shall be eaten
        in a holy place.  It is most holy.
007:007 "'As is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering;
        there is one law for them.  The priest who makes atonement
        with them shall have it.
007:008 The priest who offers any man's burnt offering, even the priest
        shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which
        he has offered.
007:009 Every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all
        that is dressed in the frying pan, and on the baking pan,
        shall be the priest's who offers it.
007:010 Every meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all
        the sons of Aaron, one as well as another.
007:011 "'This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
        which one shall offer to Yahweh.
007:012 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer
        with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed
        with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
        mixed with oil.
007:013 With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his offering
        with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving.
007:014 Of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave
        offering to Yahweh.  It shall be the priest's who sprinkles
        the blood of the peace offerings.
007:015 The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
        thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering.
        He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
007:016 "'But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or a freewill
        offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice;
        and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten:
007:017 but what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
        day shall be burned with fire.
007:018 If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
        is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted,
        neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it.
        It will be an abomination, and the soul who eats any of it
        will bear his iniquity.
007:019 "'The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten.
        It shall be burned with fire.  As for the flesh, everyone who
        is clean may eat it;
007:020 but the soul who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
        offerings, that belongs to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him,
        that soul shall be cut off from his people.
007:021 When anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man,
        or an unclean animal, or any unclean abomination, and eats some
        of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong
        to Yahweh, that soul shall be cut off from his people.'"
007:022 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
007:023 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'You shall eat no fat,
        of ox, or sheep, or goat.
007:024 The fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that
        which is torn of animals, may be used for any other service,
        but you shall in no way eat of it.
007:025 For whoever eats the fat of the animal, of which men offer
        an offering made by fire to Yahweh, even the soul who eats
        it shall be cut off from his people.
007:026 You shall not eat any blood, whether it is of bird or of animal,
        in any of your dwellings.
007:027 Whoever it is who eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off
        from his people.'"
007:028 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
007:029 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'He who offers
        the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Yahweh shall bring his
        offering to Yahweh out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
007:030 With his own hands he shall bring the offerings of Yahweh
        made by fire.  He shall bring the fat with the breast,
        that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before Yahweh.
007:031 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast
        shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
007:032 The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave
        offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
007:033 He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the
        peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh
        for a portion.
007:034 For the waved breast and the heaved thigh I have taken from the
        children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
        and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons
        as their portion forever from the children of Israel.'"
007:035 This is the anointing portion of Aaron, and the anointing portion
        of his sons, out of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,
        in the day when he presented them to minister to Yahweh
        in the priest's office;
007:036 which Yahweh commanded to be given them of the children of Israel,
        in the day that he anointed them.  It is their portion forever
        throughout their generations.
007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering,
        and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering,
        and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings;
007:038 which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that
        he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings
        to Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.
008:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
008:002 "Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments,
        and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering,
        and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
008:003 and assemble all the congregation at the door of the
        Tent of Meeting."
008:004 Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the congregation was
        assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
008:005 Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing which Yahweh
        has commanded to be done."
008:006 Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
008:007 He put the coat on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him
        with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfully
        woven band of the ephod on him, and fastened it to him with it.
008:008 He placed the breastplate on him; and in the breastplate he put
        the Urim and the Thummim.
008:009 He set the turban on his head; and on the turban, in front,
        he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
008:010 Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
        and all that was in it, and sanctified them.
008:011 He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed
        the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base,
        to sanctify them.
008:012 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head,
        and anointed him, to sanctify him.
008:013 Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats,
        and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
008:014 He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons
        laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
008:015 He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns
        of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
        the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar,
        and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.
008:016 He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover
        of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses
        burned it on the altar.
008:017 But the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung,
        he burned with fire outside the camp; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
008:018 He presented the ram of the burnt offering:  and Aaron and his
        sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
008:019 He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.
008:020 He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burned the head,
        and the pieces, and the fat.
008:021 He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses
        burned the whole ram on the altar.  It was a burnt offering
        for a sweet savor.  It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
008:022 He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration:
        and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
008:023 He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on
        the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand,
        and on the great toe of his right foot.
008:024 He brought Aaron's sons; and Moses put some of the blood
        on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their
        right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot;
        and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.
008:025 He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on
        the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys,
        and their fat, and the right thigh;
008:026 and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Yahweh,
        he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread,
        and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and on the right thigh.
008:027 He put all these in Aaron's hands and in his sons' hands, and waved
        them for a wave offering before Yahweh.
008:028 Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on
        the burnt offering.  They were a consecration for a sweet savor.
        It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
008:029 Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
        before Yahweh.  It was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
008:030 Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which
        was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments,
        and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him,
        and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons'
        garments with him.
008:031 Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the door
        of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that
        is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying,
        'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'
008:032 What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall
        burn with fire.
008:033 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting
        seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled:
        for he shall consecrate you seven days.
008:034 What has been done this day, so Yahweh has commanded to do,
        to make atonement for you.
008:035 At the door of the Tent of Meeting you shall stay day and night
        seven days, and keep the charge of Yahweh, that you don't die:
        for so I am commanded."
008:036 Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh
        commanded by Moses.
009:001 It happened on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons,
        and the elders of Israel;
009:002 and he said to Aaron, "Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering,
        and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer
        them before Yahweh.
009:003 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Take a male
        goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old,
        without blemish, for a burnt offering;
009:004 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
        before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil:
        for today Yahweh appears to you.'"
009:005 They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting:
        and all the congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh.
009:006 Moses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you
        should do:  and the glory of Yahweh shall appear to you."
009:007 Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar, and offer
        your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make
        atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer
        the offering of the people, and make atonement for them;
        as Yahweh commanded."
009:008 So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of
        the sin offering, which was for himself.
009:009 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped
        his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar,
        and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:
009:010 but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from
        the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
009:011 The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
009:012 He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered the blood
        to him, and he sprinkled it on the altar round about.
009:013 They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece,
        and the head:  and he burned them upon the altar.
009:014 He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt
        offering on the altar.
009:015 He presented the people's offering, and took the goat of
        the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it,
        and offered it for sin, like the first.
009:016 He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according
        to the ordinance.
009:017 He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there,
        and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering
        of the morning.
009:018 He also killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings,
        which was for the people:  and Aaron's sons delivered to him
        the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about,
009:019 and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that
        which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover
        of the liver:
009:020 and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat
        on the altar:
009:021 and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave
        offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.
009:022 Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them;
        and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the
        burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
009:023 Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out,
        and blessed the people:  and the glory of Yahweh appeared
        to all the people.
009:024 There came forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt
        offering and the fat upon the altar:  and when all the people
        saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
010:001 Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer,
        and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange
        fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.
010:002 And fire came forth from before Yahweh, and devoured them,
        and they died before Yahweh.
010:003 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what Yahweh spoke of,
        saying, 'I will show myself holy to those who come near me,
        and before all the people I will be glorified.'"
        Aaron held his peace.
010:004 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle
        of Aaron, and said to them, "Draw near, carry your brothers
        from before the sanctuary out of the camp."
010:005 So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp,
        as Moses had said.
010:006 Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons,
        "Don't let the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear
        your clothes; that you don't die, and that he not be angry
        with all the congregation:  but let your brothers, the whole
        house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.
010:007 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting,
        lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you."
        They did according to the word of Moses.
010:008 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,
010:009 "Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you,
        when you go into the Tent of Meeting, that you don't die:
        it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations:
010:010 and that you are to make a distinction between the holy
        and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;
010:011 and that you are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes
        which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses."
010:012 Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar,
        his sons who were left, "Take the meal offering that remains
        of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without
        yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;
010:013 and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion,
        and your sons' portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire:
        for so I am commanded.
010:014 The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a
        clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you:
        for they are given as your portion, and your sons' portion, out of
        the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.
010:015 The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with
        the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave
        offering before Yahweh:  and it shall be yours, and your sons'
        with you, as a portion forever; as Yahweh has commanded."
010:016 Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering,
        and, behold, it was burned:  and he was angry with Eleazar
        and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,
010:017 "Why haven't you eaten the sin offering in the place of
        the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he has given it you
        to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement
        for them before Yahweh?
010:018 Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of
        the sanctuary:  you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary,
        as I commanded."
010:019 Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this day they have offered
        their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh;
        and such things as these have happened to me:  and if I had
        eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing
        in the sight of Yahweh?"
010:020 When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.
011:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,
011:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'These are the living
        things which you may eat among all the animals that are
        on the earth.
011:003 Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and chews
        the cud among the animals, that you may eat.
011:004 "'Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew
        the cud, or of those who part the hoof:  the camel,
        because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof,
        he is unclean to you.
011:005 The coney, because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof,
        he is unclean to you.
011:006 The hare, because she chews the cud but doesn't part the hoof,
        she is unclean to you.
011:007 The pig, because he has a split hoof, and is cloven-footed,
        but doesn't chew the cud, he is unclean to you.
011:008 Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you
        shall not touch; they are unclean to you.
011:009 "'These you may eat of all that are in the waters:
        whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas,
        and in the rivers, that you may eat.
011:010 All that don't have fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers,
        of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures
        that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you,
011:011 and you detest them.  You shall not eat of their flesh,
        and you shall detest their carcasses.
011:012 Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an
        abomination to you.
011:013 "'These you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten,
        they are an abomination:  the eagle, and the vulture,
        and the black vulture,
011:014 and the red kite, any kind of black kite,
011:015 any kind of raven,
011:016 the horned owl, the screech owl, and the gull, any kind of hawk,
011:017 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
011:018 the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,
011:019 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.
011:020 "'All flying insects that walk on all fours are an
        abomination to you.
011:021 Yet you may eat these:  of all winged creeping things
        that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet,
        with which to hop on the earth.
011:022 Even of these you may eat:  any kind of locust, any kind of katydid,
        any kind of cricket, and any kind of grasshopper.
011:023 But all winged creeping things which have four feet,
        are an abomination to you.
011:024 "'By these you will become unclean:  whoever touches the carcass
        of them shall be unclean until the evening.
011:025 Whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes,
        and be unclean until the evening.
011:026 "'Every animal which parts the hoof, and is not cloven-footed,
        nor chews the cud, is unclean to you.  Everyone who touches
        them shall be unclean.
011:027 Whatever goes on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours,
        they are unclean to you.  Whoever touches their carcass shall
        be unclean until the evening.
011:028 He who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be
        unclean until the evening.  They are unclean to you.
011:029 "'These are they which are unclean to you among the creeping
        things that creep on the earth:  the weasel, the rat,
        any kind of great lizard,
011:030 the gecko, and the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink,
        and the chameleon.
011:031 These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep.
        Whoever touches them when they are dead, shall be unclean
        until the evening.
011:032 On whatever any of them falls when they are dead, it shall be unclean;
        whether it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack,
        whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must
        be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening;
        then it will be clean.
011:033 Every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, all that is
        in it shall be unclean, and you shall break it.
011:034 All food which may be eaten, that on which water comes,
        shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every
        such vessel shall be unclean.
011:035 Everything whereupon part of their carcass falls shall be unclean;
        whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces:
        they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.
011:036 Nevertheless a spring or a cistern in which water is a gathered
        shall be clean:  but that which touches their carcass
        shall be unclean.
011:037 If part of their carcass falls on any sowing seed which is
        to be sown, it is clean.
011:038 But if water is put on the seed, and part of their carcass
        falls on it, it is unclean to you.
011:039 "'If any animal, of which you may eat, dies; he who touches
        its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
011:040 He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be
        unclean until the evening.  He also who carries its carcass
        shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
011:041 "'Every creeping thing that creeps on the earth is an abomination.
        It shall not be eaten.
011:042 Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours,
        or whatever has many feet, even all creeping things
        that creep on the earth, them you shall not eat; for they
        are an abomination.
011:043 You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
        thing that creeps, neither shall you make yourselves unclean
        with them, that you should be defiled thereby.
011:044 For I am Yahweh your God.  Sanctify yourselves therefore,
        and be holy; for I am holy:  neither shall you defile yourselves
        with any kind of creeping thing that moves on the earth.
011:045 For I am Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt,
        to be your God.  You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
011:046 "'This is the law of the animal, and of the bird, and of every
        living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature
        that creeps on the earth,
011:047 to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean,
        and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living
        thing that may not be eaten.'"
012:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
012:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives,
        and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days;
        as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean.
012:003 In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
012:004 She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days.
        She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary,
        until the days of her purifying are completed.
012:005 But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean
        two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood
        of purification sixty-six days.
012:006 "'When the days of her purification are completed, for a son,
        or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door
        of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering,
        and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering:
012:007 and he shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her;
        and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.
        "'This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.
012:008 If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves,
        or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering,
        and the other for a sin offering:  and the priest shall make
        atonement for her, and she shall be clean.'"
013:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
013:002 "When a man shall have a rising in his body's skin, or a scab,
        or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his body
        the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron
        the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:
013:003 and the priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body:
        and if the hair in the plague has turned white, and the
        appearance of the plague is deeper than the body's skin,
        it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall examine him,
        and pronounce him unclean.
013:004 If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body,
        and the appearance of it isn't deeper than the skin,
        and the hair of it hasn't turned white, then the priest shall
        isolate the infected person for seven days.
013:005 The priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and, behold,
        if in his eyes the plague is arrested, and the plague hasn't
        spread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for
        seven more days.
013:006 The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day;
        and behold, if the plague has faded, and the plague hasn't
        spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean.
        It is a scab.  He shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
013:007 But if the scab spreads on the skin, after he has shown himself
        to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself
        to the priest again.
013:008 The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread
        on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.
        It is leprosy.
013:009 "When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
        brought to the priest;
013:010 and the priest shall examine him.  Behold, if there is a white
        rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white,
        and there is raw flesh in the rising,
013:011 it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest
        shall pronounce him unclean.  He shall not isolate him,
        for he is unclean.
013:012 "If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy
        covers all the skin of the infected person from his head
        even to his feet, as far as it appears to the priest;
013:013 then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the leprosy has
        covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague.
        It has all turned white:  he is clean.
013:014 But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.
013:015 The priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean:
        the raw flesh is unclean.  It is leprosy.
013:016 Or if the raw flesh turns again, and is changed to white,
        then he shall come to the priest;
013:017 and the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the plague
        has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean
        of the plague.  He is clean.
013:018 "When the body has a boil on its skin, and it has healed,
013:019 and in the place of the boil there is a white rising,
        or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown
        to the priest;
013:020 and the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the appearance
        of it is lower than the skin, and the hair of it has
        turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.
        It is the plague of leprosy.  It has broken out in the boil.
013:021 But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white
        hairs in it, and it isn't deeper than the skin, but is dim,
        then the priest shall isolate him seven days.
013:022 If it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce
        him unclean.  It is a plague.
013:023 But if the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn't spread,
        it is the scar from the boil; and the priest shall
        pronounce him clean.
013:024 "Or when the body has a burn from fire on its skin, and the raw
        flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,
013:025 then the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair
        in the bright spot has turned white, and the appearance of it
        is deeper than the skin; it is leprosy.  It has broken out
        in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean.
        It is the plague of leprosy.
013:026 But if the priest examines it, and behold, there is no white
        hair in the bright spot, and it isn't lower than the skin,
        but is faded; then the priest shall isolate him seven days.
013:027 The priest shall examine him on the seventh day.  If it has spread
        in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.
        It is the plague of leprosy.
013:028 If the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn't spread
        in the skin, but is faded, it is the swelling from the burn,
        and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar
        from the burn.
013:029 "When a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard,
013:030 then the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if the
        appearance of it is deeper than the skin, and the hair in it
        is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
        it is an itch, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
013:031 If the priest examines the plague of itching, and behold,
        its appearance isn't deeper than the skin, and there is no
        black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate him the person
        infected with itching seven days.
013:032 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the plague; and behold,
        if the itch hasn't spread, and there is no yellow hair in it,
        and the appearance of the itch isn't deeper than the skin,
013:033 then he shall be shaved, but he shall not shave the itch;
        and the priest shall shut him up who has the itch seven more days.
013:034 On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the itch; and behold,
        if the itch hasn't spread in the skin, and its appearance isn't
        deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean.
        He shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
013:035 But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,
013:036 then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the itch has
        spread in the skin, the priest shall not look for the yellow hair;
        he is unclean.
013:037 But if in his eyes the itch is arrested, and black hair
        has grown in it; the itch is healed, he is clean.
        The priest shall pronounce him clean.
013:038 "When a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body,
        even white bright spots;
013:039 then the priest shall examine them; and behold, if the bright
        spots on the skin of their body are a dull white,
        it is a harmless rash, it has broken out in the skin;
        he is clean.
013:040 "If a man's hair has fallen from his head, he is bald.
        He is clean.
013:041 If his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head,
        he is forehead bald.  He is clean.
013:042 But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead,
        a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his
        bald head, or his bald forehead.
013:043 Then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the rising
        of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his
        bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin
        of the flesh,
013:044 he is a leprous man.  He is unclean.  The priest shall surely
        pronounce him unclean.  His plague is on his head.
013:045 "The leper in whom the plague is shall wear torn clothes,
        and the hair of his head shall hang loose.  He shall cover
        his upper lip, and shall cry, 'Unclean!  Unclean!'
013:046 All the days in which the plague is in him he shall be unclean.
        He is unclean.  He shall dwell alone.  Outside of the camp
        shall be his dwelling.
013:047 "The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
        is a woolen garment, or a linen garment;
013:048 whether it is in warp, or woof; of linen, or of wool;
        whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;
013:049 if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin,
        or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything made of skin;
        it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown to the priest.
013:050 The priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the
        plague seven days.
013:051 He shall examine the plague on the seventh day.
        If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp,
        or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin
        is used for, the plague is a destructive mildew.
        It is unclean.
013:052 He shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool
        or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is:
        for it is a destructive mildew.  It shall be burned in the fire.
013:053 "If the priest examines it, and behold, the plague hasn't
        spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof,
        or in anything of skin;
013:054 then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which
        the plague is, and he shall isolate it seven more days.
013:055 Then the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed;
        and behold, if the plague hasn't changed its color, and the plague
        hasn't spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire.
        It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside or outside.
013:056 If the priest looks, and behold, the plague has faded after
        it is washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment,
        or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
013:057 and if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp,
        or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading.
        You shall burn with fire that in which the plague is.
013:058 The garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing
        of skin it is, which you shall wash, if the plague has
        departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time,
        and it will be clean."
013:059 This is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool
        or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or in anything of skin,
        to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
014:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
014:002 "This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing.
        He shall be brought to the priest,
014:003 and the priest shall go forth out of the camp.  The priest shall
        examine him, and behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed
        in the leper,
014:004 then the priest shall command them to take for him who is
        to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood,
        and scarlet, and hyssop.
014:005 The priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an
        earthen vessel over running water.
014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
        and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and
        the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed
        over the running water.
014:007 He shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy
        seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let
        the living bird go into the open field.
014:008 "He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off
        all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean.
        After that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell
        outside his tent seven days.
014:009 It shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his
        hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
        his hair he shall shave off.  He shall wash his clothes,
        and he shall bathe his body in water, then he shall be clean.
014:010 "On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish,
        and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenths
        of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil,
        and one log of oil.
014:011 The priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to
        be cleansed, and those things, before Yahweh, at the door
        of the Tent of Meeting.
014:012 "The priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer him
        for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, and wave them
        for a wave offering before Yahweh.
014:013 He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill
        the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place
        of the sanctuary; for as the sin offering is the priest's,
        so is the trespass offering.  It is most holy.
014:014 The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
        and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him
        who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand,
        and on the big toe of his right foot.
014:015 The priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it
        into the palm of his own left hand.
014:016 The priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his
        left hand, and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger
        seven times before Yahweh.
014:017 The priest shall put some of the rest of the oil that is in his
        hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed,
        and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his
        right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering.
014:018 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
        on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest
        shall make atonement for him before Yahweh.
014:019 "The priest shall offer the sin offering, and make atonement
        for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness:
        and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering;
014:020 and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal
        offering on the altar.  The priest shall make atonement for him,
        and he shall be clean.
014:021 "If he is poor, and can't afford so much, then he shall
        take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved,
        to make atonement for him, and one tenth of an ephah of fine
        flour mingled with oil for a meal offering, and a log of oil;
014:022 and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able
        to afford; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other
        a burnt offering.
014:023 "On the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to
        the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, before Yahweh.
014:024 The priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,
        and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave
        offering before Yahweh.
014:025 He shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering.
        The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
        offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him
        who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand,
        and on the big toe of his right foot.
014:026 The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his
        own left hand;
014:027 and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of
        the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Yahweh.
014:028 Then the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand
        on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed,
        and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his
        right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering.
014:029 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
        on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement
        for him before Yahweh.
014:030 He shall offer one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons,
        such as he is able to afford,
014:031 even such as he is able to afford, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering, with the meal offering.
        The priest shall make atonement for him who is to be
        cleansed before Yahweh."
014:032 This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy,
        who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing.
014:033 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
014:034 "When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
        for a possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house
        in the land of your possession,
014:035 then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying,
        'There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house.'
014:036 The priest shall command that they empty the house,
        before the priest goes in to examine the plague,
        that all that is in the house not be made unclean:
        and afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.
014:037 He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in
        the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish,
        and it appears to be deeper than the wall;
014:038 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,
        and shut up the house seven days.
014:039 The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look.
        If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,
014:040 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones
        in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place
        outside of the city:
014:041 and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped round about,
        and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scraped off,
        outside of the city into an unclean place.
014:042 They shall take other stones, and put them in the place
        of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall
        plaster the house.
014:043 "If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house,
        after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped
        the house, and after it was plastered;
014:044 then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague
        has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house.
        It is unclean.
014:045 He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber,
        and all the house's mortar.  He shall carry them out of the city
        into an unclean place.
014:046 "Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall
        be unclean until the evening.
014:047 He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes;
        and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
014:048 "If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold,
        the plague hasn't spread in the house, after the house
        was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean,
        because the plague is healed.
014:049 To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, and cedar wood,
        and scarlet, and hyssop.
014:050 He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel
        over running water.
014:051 He shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet,
        and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird,
        and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
014:052 He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with
        the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood,
        with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;
014:053 but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into
        the open field.  So shall he make atonement for the house;
        and it shall be clean."
014:054 This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch,
014:055 and for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house,
014:056 and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;
014:057 to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean.
        This is the law of leprosy.
015:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
015:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When any
        man has a discharge from his body, because of his discharge
        he is unclean.
015:003 This shall be his uncleanness in his discharge:
        whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body has
        stopped from his discharge, it is his uncleanness.
015:004 "'Every bed whereon he who has the discharge lies shall be unclean;
        and everything he sits on shall be unclean.
015:005 Whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
        himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
015:006 He who sits on anything whereon the man who has the discharge
        sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and be unclean until the evening.
015:007 "'He who touches the body of him who has the discharge shall
        wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
        until the evening.
015:008 "'If he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean,
        then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and be unclean until the evening.
015:009 "'Whatever saddle he who has the discharge rides on
        shall be unclean.
015:010 Whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean
        until the evening.  He who carries those things shall wash
        his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
        until the evening.
015:011 "'Whoever he who has the discharge touches, without having
        rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes,
        and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
015:012 "'The earthen vessel, which he who has the discharge touches,
        shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
015:013 "'When he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge,
        then he shall count to himself seven days for his cleansing,
        and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water,
        and shall be clean.
015:014 "'On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves, or two
        young pigeons, and come before Yahweh to the door of the Tent
        of Meeting, and give them to the priest:
015:015 and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering.  The priest shall make
        atonement for him before Yahweh for his discharge.
015:016 "'If any man has an emission of semen, then he shall bathe
        all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.
015:017 Every garment, and every skin, whereon the semen is, shall be
        washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.
015:018 If a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen,
        they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean
        until the evening.
015:019 "'If a woman has a discharge, and her discharge in her
        flesh is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days:
        and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.
015:020 "'Everything that she lies on in her impurity shall be unclean.
        Everything also that she sits on shall be unclean.
015:021 Whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
        himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
015:022 Whoever touches anything that she sits on shall wash his clothes,
        and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
015:023 If it is on the bed, or on anything whereon she sits,
        when he touches it, he shall be unclean until the evening.
015:024 "'If any man lies with her, and her monthly flow is on him,
        he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lies
        shall be unclean.
015:025 "'If a woman has a discharge of her blood many days not
        in the time of her period, or if she has a discharge beyond
        the time of her period; all the days of the discharge
        of her uncleanness shall be as in the days of her period:
        she is unclean.
015:026 Every bed whereon she lies all the days of her discharge shall
        be to her as the bed of her period:  and everything whereon
        she sits shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her period.
015:027 Whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash
        his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
        until the evening.
015:028 "'But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count
        to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
015:029 On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves, or two
        young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door
        of the Tent of Meeting.
015:030 The priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other
        for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement
        for her before Yahweh for the uncleanness of her discharge.
015:031 "'Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from
        their uncleanness, so they will not die in their uncleanness,
        when they defile my tabernacle that is in their midst.'"
015:032 This is the law of him who has a discharge, and of him who has
        an emission of semen, so that he is unclean thereby;
015:033 and of her who has her period, and of a man or woman who has
        a discharge, and of him who lies with her who is unclean.
016:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
        when they drew near before Yahweh, and died;
016:002 and Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron your brother, not to come
        at all times into the Most Holy Place within the veil,
        before the mercy seat which is on the ark; lest he die:
        for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.
016:003 "Herewith shall Aaron come into the sanctuary:  with a young
        bull for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
        breeches on his body, and shall put on the linen sash, and he shall
        be dressed with the linen turban.  They are the holy garments.
        He shall bathe his body in water, and put them on.
016:005 He shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two
        male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
016:006 "Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering, which is
        for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house.
016:007 He shall take the two goats, and set them before Yahweh at
        the door of the Tent of Meeting.
016:008 Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats; one lot for Yahweh,
        and the other lot for the scapegoat.
016:009 Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh,
        and offer him for a sin offering.
016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell for the scapegoat, shall be
        presented alive before Yahweh, to make atonement for him,
        to send him away for the scapegoat into the wilderness.
016:011 "Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering,
        which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself
        and for his house, and shall kill the bull of the sin offering
        which is for himself.
016:012 He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar
        before Yahweh, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small,
        and bring it within the veil:
016:013 and he shall put the incense on the fire before Yahweh,
        that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is
        on the testimony, so that he will not die.
016:014 He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it
        with his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and before
        the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his
        finger seven times.
016:015 "Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, that is
        for the people, and bring his blood within the veil,
        and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull,
        and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
016:016 and he shall make atonement for the Holy Place,
        because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel,
        and because of their transgressions, even all their sins;
        and so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells
        with them in the midst of their uncleanness.
016:017 There shall be no one in the Tent of Meeting when he enters
        to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out,
        and has made atonement for himself and for his household,
        and for all the assembly of Israel.
016:018 "He shall go out to the altar that is before Yahweh and make
        atonement for it, and shall take some of the bull's blood,
        and some of the goat's blood, and put it on the horns
        of the altar round about.
016:019 He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger
        seven times, and cleanse it, and make it holy from the uncleanness
        of the children of Israel.
016:020 "When he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place, the Tent
        of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat.
016:021 Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat,
        and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
        of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins;
        and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall
        send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man
        who is in readiness.
016:022 The goat shall carry all their iniquities on himself to a
        solitary land, and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.
016:023 "Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take
        off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into
        the Holy Place, and shall leave them there.
016:024 Then he shall bathe himself in water in a holy place, and put
        on his garments, and come out and offer his burnt offering
        and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement
        for himself and for the people.
016:025 The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
016:026 "He who lets the goat go for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes,
        and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come
        into the camp.
016:027 The bull for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering,
        whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place,
        shall be carried forth outside the camp; and they shall burn
        their skins, their flesh, and their dung with fire.
016:028 He who burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh
        in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
016:029 "It shall be a statute to you forever:  in the seventh month,
        on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls,
        and shall do no manner of work, the native-born, or the stranger
        who lives as a foreigner among you:
016:030 for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you;
        from all your sins you shall be clean before Yahweh.
016:031 It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict
        your souls; it is a statute forever.
016:032 The priest, who is anointed and who is consecrated to be
        priest in his father's place, shall make the atonement,
        and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments.
016:033 Then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary; and he shall
        make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar;
        and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all
        the people of the assembly.
016:034 "This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for
        the children of Israel once in the year because of all their sins."
        It was done as Yahweh commanded Moses.
017:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
017:002 "Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel,
        and say to them:  'This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded,
017:003 Whatever man there is of the house of Israel, who kills an ox,
        or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp,
017:004 and hasn't brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to offer
        it as an offering to Yahweh before the tabernacle of Yahweh:
        blood shall be imputed to that man.  He has shed blood;
        and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
017:005 This is to the end that the children of Israel may bring
        their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field,
        that they may bring them to Yahweh, to the door of the Tent
        of Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices
        of peace offerings to Yahweh.
017:006 The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Yahweh at
        the door of the Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet
        savor to Yahweh.
017:007 They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols,
        after which they play the prostitute.  This shall be a statute
        forever to them throughout their generations.'
017:008 "You shall say to them, 'Any man there is of the house of Israel,
        or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them,
        who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
017:009 and doesn't bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting,
        to sacrifice it to Yahweh; that man shall be cut off
        from his people.
017:010 "'Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live
        as foreigners among them, who eats any kind of blood,
        I will set my face against that soul who eats blood,
        and will cut him off from among his people.
017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given
        it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls:
        for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life.
017:012 Therefore I have said to the children of Israel, "No person
        among you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who lives
        as a foreigner among you eat blood."
017:013 "'Whatever man there is of the children of Israel,
        or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them,
        who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be eaten;
        he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.
017:014 For as to the life of all flesh, its blood is with its life:
        therefore I said to the children of Israel, "You shall not eat
        the blood of any kind of flesh; for the life of all flesh
        is its blood.  Whoever eats it shall be cut off."
017:015 "'Every person that eats what dies of itself, or that which is
        torn by animals, whether he is native-born or a foreigner,
        he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and be unclean until the evening:  then he shall be clean.
017:016 But if he doesn't wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall
        bear his iniquity.'"
018:001 Yahweh said to Moses,
018:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'I am
        Yahweh your God.
018:003 You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived:
        and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I
        am bringing you; neither shall you walk in their statutes.
018:004 You shall do my ordinances, and you shall keep my statutes,
        and walk in them:  I am Yahweh your God.
018:005 You shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances;
        which if a man does, he shall live in them:  I am Yahweh.
018:006 "'None of you shall approach anyone who are his close relatives,
        to uncover their nakedness:  I am Yahweh.
018:007 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father,
        nor the nakedness of your mother:  she is your mother.
        You shall not uncover her nakedness.
018:008 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife:
        it is your father's nakedness.
018:009 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister,
        the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother,
        whether born at home, or born abroad.
018:010 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter,
        or of your daughter's daughter, even their nakedness:
        for theirs is your own nakedness.
018:011 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's
        wife's daughter, conceived by your father, since she
        is your sister.
018:012 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister:
        she is your father's near kinswoman.
018:013 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister:
        for she is your mother's near kinswoman.
018:014 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother,
        you shall not approach his wife:  she is your aunt.
018:015 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law:
        she is your son's wife.  You shall not uncover her nakedness.
018:016 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife:
        it is your brother's nakedness.
018:017 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter.
        You shall not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter,
        to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen:
        it is wickedness.
018:018 "'You shall not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival,
        to uncover her nakedness, while her sister is yet alive.
018:019 "'You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness,
        as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.
018:020 "'You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife,
        and defile yourself with her.
018:021 "'You shall not give any of your children to sacrifice to Molech;
        neither shall you profane the name of your God:  I am Yahweh.
018:022 "'You shall not lie with a man, as with a woman.
        That is detestable.
018:023 "'You shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it;
        neither shall any woman give herself to an animal, to lie
        down with it:  it is a perversion.
018:024 "'Don't defile yourselves in any of these things:
        for in all these the nations which I am casting out before
        you were defiled.
018:025 The land was defiled:  therefore I punished its iniquity,
        and the land vomited out her inhabitants.
018:026 You therefore shall keep my statutes and my ordinances, and shall
        not do any of these abominations; neither the native-born,
        nor the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you;
018:027 (for all these abominations have the men of the land done,
        that were before you, and the land became defiled);
018:028 that the land not vomit you out also, when you defile it,
        as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
018:029 "'For whoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls
        that do them shall be cut off from among their people.
018:030 Therefore you shall keep my charge, that you do not practice
        any of these abominable customs, which were practiced
        before you, and that you do not defile yourselves with them:
        I am Yahweh your God.'"
019:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
019:002 "Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        and tell them, 'You shall be holy; for I Yahweh your God am holy.
019:003 "'Each one of you shall respect his mother and his father.
        You shall keep my Sabbaths.  I am Yahweh your God.
019:004 "'Don't turn to idols, nor make molten gods for yourselves.
        I am Yahweh your God.
019:005 "'When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh,
        you shall offer it so that you may be accepted.
019:006 It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the next day:
        and if anything remains until the third day, it shall be
        burned with fire.
019:007 If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination.
        It will not be accepted;
019:008 but everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has
        profaned the holy thing of Yahweh, and that soul shall be cut
        off from his people.
019:009 "'When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly
        reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather
        the gleanings of your harvest.
019:010 You shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather
        the fallen grapes of your vineyard; you shall leave them
        for the poor and for the foreigner.  I am Yahweh your God.
019:011 "'You shall not steal; neither shall you deal falsely,
        nor lie to one another.
019:012 "'You shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name
        of your God.  I am Yahweh.
019:013 "'You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him.
        The wages of a hired servant shall not remain with you all
        night until the morning.
019:014 "'You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling
        block before the blind; but you shall fear your God.
        I am Yahweh.
019:015 "'You shall do no injustice in judgment:  you shall not be
        partial to the poor, nor show favoritism to the great;

019:017 "'You shall not hate your brother in your heart.
        You shall surely rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin
        because of him.
019:018 "'You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against
        the children of your people; but you shall love your neighbor
        as yourself.  I am Yahweh.
019:019 "'You shall keep my statutes.  "'You shall not crossbreed
        different kinds of animals.  "'you shall not sow your field
        with two kinds of seed; "'neither shall there come upon on you
        a garment made of two kinds of material.
019:020 "'If a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave girl,
        pledged to be married to another man, and not ransomed,
        or given her freedom; they shall be punished.  They shall
        not be put to death, because she was not free.
019:021 He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh, to the door
        of the Tent of Meeting, even a ram for a trespass offering.
019:022 The priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass
        offering before Yahweh for his sin which he has committed:
        and the sin which he has committed shall be forgiven him.
019:023 "'When you come into the land, and have planted all kinds of trees
        for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden.{literally,
        "uncircumcised"} Three years shall they be forbidden to you.
        It shall not be eaten.
019:024 But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, for giving
        praise to Yahweh.
019:025 In the fifth year you shall eat its fruit, that it may yield
        its increase to you.  I am Yahweh your God.
019:026 "'You shall not eat any meat with the blood still in it;
        neither shall you use enchantments, nor practice sorcery.
019:027 "'You shall not cut the hair on the sides of your heads,
        neither shall you clip off the edge of your beard.

019:029 "'Don't profane your daughter, to make her a prostitute;
        lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become
        full of wickedness.

        I am Yahweh.
019:031 "'Don't turn to those who are mediums, nor to the wizards.
        Don't seek them out, to be defiled by them.  I am Yahweh your God.

019:035 "'You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures
        of length, of weight, or of quantity.

        of the land of Egypt.
019:037 You shall observe all my statutes, and all my ordinances,
        and do them.  I am Yahweh.'"
020:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
020:002 "Moreover, you shall tell the children of Israel, 'Anyone of
        the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as
        foreigners in Israel, who gives any of his seed to Molech;
        he shall surely be put to death.  The people of the land
        shall stone him with stones.
020:003 I also will set my face against that person, and will cut him off
        from among his people because he has given of his seed to Molech,
        to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
020:004 If the people of the land all hide their eyes from that person,
        when he gives of his seed to Molech, and don't put him to death;
020:005 then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,
        and will cut him off, and all who play the prostitute after him,
        to play the prostitute with Molech, from among their people.
020:006 "'The person that turns to those who are mediums,
        and to the wizards, to play the prostitute after them,
        I will even set my face against that person, and will cut
        him off from among his people.
020:007 "'Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am
        Yahweh your God.
020:008 You shall keep my statutes, and do them.  I am Yahweh
        who sanctifies you.
020:009 "'For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely
        be put to death:  he has cursed his father or his mother;
        his blood shall be upon him.
020:010 "'The man who commits adultery with another man's wife,
        even he who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife,
        the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
020:011 The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his
        father's nakedness:  both of them shall surely be put to death;
        their blood shall be upon them.
020:012 "'If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall
        surely be put to death:  they have committed a perversion;
        their blood shall be upon them.
020:013 "'If a man lies with a male, as with a woman, both of them have
        committed an abomination:  they shall surely be put to death;
        their blood shall be upon them.
020:014 "'If a man takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness:

        may be no wickedness among you.
020:015 "'If a man lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death;
        and you shall kill the animal.
020:016 "'If a woman approaches any animal, and lies down with it,
        you shall kill the woman, and the animal:  they shall surely
        be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
020:017 "'If a man takes his sister, his father's daughter,
        or his mother's daughter, and sees her nakedness, and she
        sees his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall
        be cut off in the sight of the children of their people:
        he has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
020:018 "'If a man lies with a woman having her monthly period,
        and uncovers her nakedness; he has made naked her fountain,
        and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood:
        and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
020:019 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, nor of

020:021 "'If a man takes his brother's wife, it is an impurity:
        he has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
020:022 "'You shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my ordinances,
        and do them; that the land, where I am bringing you to dwell,
        may not vomit you out.
020:023 You shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am
        casting out before you:  for they did all these things,
        and therefore I abhorred them.
020:024 But I have said to you, "You shall inherit their land, and I will
        give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey."
        I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
020:025 "'You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal
        and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean:
        and you shall not make yourselves abominable by animal,
        or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems,
        which I have separated from you as unclean for you.
020:026 You shall be holy to me:  for I, Yahweh, am holy, and have set
        you apart from the peoples, that you should be mine.
020:027 "'A man or a woman that is a medium, or is a wizard,
        shall surely be put to death:  they shall stone them with stones;
        their blood shall be upon them.'"
021:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,
        and say to them, 'A priest shall not defile himself for the dead
        among his people;
021:002 except for his relatives that are near to him:  for his mother,
        for his father, for his son, for his daughter, for his brother,
021:003 and for his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband;
        for her he may defile himself.
021:004 He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people,
        to profane himself.
021:005 "'They shall not shave their heads, neither shall they shave
        off the corners of their beards, nor make any cuttings
        in their flesh.
021:006 They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of
        their God; for they offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,
        the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
021:007 "'They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane;
        neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband:
        for he is holy to his God.
021:008 You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread
        of your God:  he shall be holy to you:  for I Yahweh,
        who sanctify you, am holy.
021:009 "'The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself
        by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father:
        she shall be burned with fire.
021:010 "'He who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head
        the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put
        on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose,
        nor tear his clothes;
021:011 neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself
        for his father, or for his mother;
021:012 neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane
        the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil
        of his God is upon him.  I am Yahweh.
021:013 "'He shall take a wife in her virginity.
021:014 A widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled,
        or a prostitute, these he shall not marry:  but a virgin
        of his own people shall he take as a wife.
021:015 He shall not profane his seed among his people:
        for I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.'"
021:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
021:017 "Say to Aaron, 'None of your seed throughout their generations
        who has a blemish, may approach to offer the bread of his God.
021:018 For whatever man he is that has a blemish, he shall not draw near:
        a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose,
        or any deformity,
021:019 or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand,
021:020 or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye,
        or an itching disease, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles;
021:021 no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, who has a blemish,
        shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.
        Since has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread
        of his God.
021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy,
        and of the holy.
021:023 He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near to the altar,
        because he has a blemish; that he may not profane my sanctuaries,
        for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.'"
021:024 So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the
        children of Israel.
022:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
022:002 "Tell Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy
        things of the children of Israel, which they make holy to me,
        and that they not profane my holy name.  I am Yahweh.
022:003 "Tell them, 'If anyone of all your seed throughout your
        generations approaches the holy things, which the children
        of Israel make holy to Yahweh, having his uncleanness
        on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me.
        I am Yahweh.
022:004 "'Whoever of the seed of Aaron is a leper or has an issue;
        he shall not eat of the holy things, until he is clean.
        Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead,
        or a man whose seed goes from him;
022:005 or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be
        made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,
        whatever uncleanness he has;
022:006 the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening,
        and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his
        body in water.
022:007 When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall
        eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
022:008 That which dies of itself, or is torn by animals, he shall
        not eat, defiling himself by it.  I am Yahweh.
022:009 "'They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear
        sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it.
        I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.
022:010 "'No stranger shall eat of the holy thing:  a foreigner
        living with the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat
        of the holy thing.
022:011 But if a priest buys a slave, purchased by his money,
        he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house,
        they shall eat of his bread.
022:012 If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider, she shall
        not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.
022:013 But if a priest's daughter is a widow, or divorced,
        and has no child, and has returned to her father's house,
        as in her youth, she may eat of her father's bread:
        but no stranger shall eat any of it.
022:014 "'If a man eats something holy unwittingly, then he shall add
        the fifth part of its value to it, and shall give the holy
        thing to the priest.
022:015 The priests shall not profane the holy things of the children
        of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,
022:016 and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt,
        when they eat their holy things:  for I am Yahweh
        who sanctifies them.'"
022:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
022:018 "Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children
        of Israel, and say to them, 'Whoever is of the house of Israel,
        or of the foreigners in Israel, who offers his offering,
        whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill offerings,
        which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt offering;
022:019 that you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without blemish,
        of the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats.
022:020 But whatever has a blemish, that you shall not offer:
        for it shall not be acceptable for you.
022:021 Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh
        to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill offering, of the herd
        or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted;
        there shall be no blemish therein.
022:022 Blind, injured, maimed, having a wart, festering, or having
        a running sore, you shall not offer these to Yahweh, nor make
        an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.
022:023 Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking
        in his parts, that you may offer for a freewill offering;
        but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
022:024 That which has its testicles bruised, crushed, broken, or cut,
        you shall not offer to Yahweh; neither shall you do thus
        in your land.
022:025 Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread
        of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them.
        There is a blemish in them.  They shall not be accepted for you.'"
022:026 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
022:027 "When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born, then it shall
        remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth
        day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the offering
        of an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
022:028 Whether it is a cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young
        both in one day.
022:029 "When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh,
        you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
022:030 It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it
        until the morning.  I am Yahweh.
022:031 "Therefore you shall keep my commandments, and do them.
        I am Yahweh.
022:032 You shall not profane my holy name, but I will be made holy
        among the children of Israel.  I am Yahweh who makes you holy,
022:033 who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God.
        I am Yahweh."
023:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
023:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The set feasts
        of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations,
        even these are my set feasts.
023:003 "'Six days shall work be done:  but on the seventh day is a Sabbath
        of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no manner of work.
        It is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.
023:004 "'These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations,
        which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.
023:005 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month
        in the evening, is Yahweh's Passover.
023:006 On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened
        bread to Yahweh.  Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
023:007 In the first day you shall have a holy convocation.
        You shall do no regular work.
023:008 But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh
        seven days.  In the seventh day is a holy convocation:
        you shall do no regular work.'"
023:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
023:010 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you
        have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap
        its the harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first
        fruits of your harvest to the priest:
023:011 and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you.
        On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
023:012 On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb
        without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
023:013 The meal offering with it shall be two tenth parts of an ephah
        of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire
        to Yahweh for a sweet savor; and the drink offering with it
        shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
023:014 You shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh grain,
        until this same day, until you have brought the offering
        of your God.  This is a statute forever throughout your
        generations in all your dwellings.
023:015 "'You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath,
        from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
        seven Sabbaths shall be completed:
023:016 even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall number
        fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh.
023:017 You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a
        wave offering made of two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour.
        They shall be baked with yeast, for first fruits to Yahweh.
023:018 You shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish
        a year old, one young bull, and two rams.  They shall
        be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their meal offering,
        and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet aroma to Yahweh.
023:019 You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male
        lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
023:020 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits
        for a wave offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs.
        They shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.
023:021 You shall make proclamation on the same day:  there shall
        be a holy convocation to you; you shall do no regular work.
        This is a statute forever in all your dwellings
        throughout your generations.
023:022 "'When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall
        not wholly reap into the corners of your field,
        neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest:
        you shall leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner.
        I am Yahweh your God.'"
023:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
023:024 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'In the seventh month,
        on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you,
        a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
023:025 You shall do no regular work; and you shall offer an offering
        made by fire to Yahweh.'"
023:026 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
023:027 "However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day
        of atonement:  it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you
        shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering
        made by fire to Yahweh.
023:028 You shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day
        of atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God.
023:029 For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day;
        shall be cut off from his people.
023:030 Whoever it is who does any manner of work in that same day,
        that person I will destroy from among his people.
023:031 You shall do no manner of work:  it is a statute forever
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
023:032 It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall
        deny yourselves.  In the ninth day of the month at evening,
        from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath."
023:033 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
023:034 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say, 'On the fifteenth
        day of this seventh month is the feast of tents for seven
        days to Yahweh.
023:035 On the first day shall be a holy convocation:  you shall
        do no regular work.
023:036 Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
        On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you;
        and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
        It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.
023:037 "'These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh, which you shall
        proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made
        by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, and a meal offering,
        a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day;
023:038 besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your gifts,
        and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings,
        which you give to Yahweh.
023:039 "'So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have
        gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast
        of Yahweh seven days:  on the first day shall be a solemn rest,
        and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
023:040 You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees,
        branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees,
        and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh
        your God seven days.
023:041 You shall keep it a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year:
        it is a statute forever throughout your generations;
        you shall keep it in the seventh month.
023:042 You shall dwell in booths seven days.  All who are native-born
        in Israel shall dwell in booths,
023:043 that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel
        to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.
        I am Yahweh your God.'"
023:044 Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed
        feasts of Yahweh.
024:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
024:002 "Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive
        oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
024:003 Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting,
        shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning
        before Yahweh continually:  it shall be a statute forever
        throughout your generations.
024:004 He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lampstand
        before Yahweh continually.
024:005 "You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it:
        two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.
024:006 You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold
        table before Yahweh.
024:007 You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may
        be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made
        by fire to Yahweh.
024:008 Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before
        Yahweh continually.  It is on the behalf of the children
        of Israel an everlasting covenant.
024:009 It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it
        in a holy place:  for it is most holy to him of the offerings
        of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute."
024:010 The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian,
        went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite
        woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.
024:011 The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed;
        and they brought him to Moses.  His mother's name was Shelomith,
        the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
024:012 They put him in custody, until the will of Yahweh should be
        declared to them.
024:013 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
024:014 "Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay
        their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
024:015 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Whoever curses
        his God shall bear his sin.
024:016 He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he shall surely be put
        to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him:
        the foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes
        the Name, shall be put to death.
024:017 "'He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
024:018 He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good,
        life for life.
024:019 If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it
        be done to him:
024:020 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth;
        as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him.
024:021 He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills
        a man shall be put to death.
024:022 You shall have one kind of law, for the foreigner as well
        as the native-born: for I am Yahweh your God.'"
024:023 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him
        who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones.
        The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
025:001 Yahweh said to Moses in Mount Sinai,
025:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you
        come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep
        a Sabbath to Yahweh.
025:003 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall
        prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruits;
025:004 but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn
        rest for the land, a Sabbath to Yahweh.  You shall not sow
        your field or prune your vineyard.
025:005 What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap,
        and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather.
        It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
025:006 The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself,
        for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant,
        and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.
025:007 For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land,
        shall all the increase of it be for food.
025:008 "'You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times
        seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven
        Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.
025:009 Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of
        the seventh month.  On the Day of Atonement you shall sound
        the trumpet throughout all your land.
025:010 You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty
        throughout the land to all its inhabitants.  It shall be a jubilee
        to you; and each of you shall return to his own property,
        and each of you shall return to his family.
025:011 That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you.  In it you
        shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself,
        nor gather from the undressed vines.
025:012 For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you.  You shall eat
        of its increase out of the field.
025:013 "'In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
025:014 "'If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor,
        you shall not wrong one another.
025:015 According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall
        buy from your neighbor.  According to the number of years
        of the crops he shall sell to you.
025:016 According to the length of the years you shall increase the price
        of it, and according to the shortness of the years you shall
        diminish the price of it; for he is selling the number
        of the crops to you.
025:017 You shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God:
        for I am Yahweh your God.
025:018 "'Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances
        and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.
025:019 The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill,
        and dwell therein in safety.
025:020 If you said, "What shall we eat the seventh year?
        Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;"
025:021 then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year,
        and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
025:022 You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits,
        the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in,
        you shall eat the old store.
025:023 "'The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine;
        for you are strangers and live as foreigners with me.
025:024 In all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption
        for the land.
025:025 "'If your brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions,
        then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and redeem
        that which his brother has sold.
025:026 If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous
        and finds sufficient means to redeem it;
025:027 then let him reckon the years since the sale of it,
        and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it;
        and he shall return to his property.
025:028 But if he isn't able to get it back for himself, then what he has
        sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until
        the Year of Jubilee:  and in the Jubilee it shall be released,
        and he shall return to his property.
025:029 "'If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
        redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold.
        For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
025:030 If it isn't redeemed within the space of a full year,
        then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure
        in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations.
        It shall not be released in the Jubilee.
025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round
        about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country:
        they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.
025:032 "'Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities
        of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.
025:033 The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city
        of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee;
        for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession
        among the children of Israel.
025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
        for it is their perpetual possession.
025:035 "'If your brother has become poor, and his hand can't
        support him among you; then you shall uphold him.
        As a stranger and a sojourner he shall live with you.
025:036 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God;
        that your brother may live among you.
025:037 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him
        your food for profit.
025:038 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land
        of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
025:039 "'If your brother has grown poor among you, and sells himself
        to you; you shall not make him to serve as a slave.
025:040 As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you;
        he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee:
025:041 then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him,
        and shall return to his own family, and to the possession
        of his fathers.
025:042 For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land
        of Egypt.  They shall not be sold as slaves.
025:043 You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall
        fear your God.
025:044 "'As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have;
        of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy
        male and female slaves.
025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you,
        of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you,
        which they have conceived in your land; and they will
        be your property.
025:046 You may make them an inheritance for your children after you,
        to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever:
        but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule,
        one over another, with harshness.
025:047 "'If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich,
        and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself
        to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member
        of the stranger's family;
025:048 after he is sold he may be redeemed.  One of his brothers
        may redeem him;
025:049 or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any
        who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him;
        or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.
025:050 He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year
        that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee:
        and the price of his sale shall be according to the number
        of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall
        he be with him.
025:051 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall
        give back the price of his redemption out of the money
        that he was bought for.
025:052 If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee,
        then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service
        he shall give back the price of his redemption.
025:053 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him:
        he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.
025:054 If he isn't redeemed by these means, then he shall be released
        in the Year of Jubilee, he, and his children with him.
025:055 For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
        servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.
        I am Yahweh your God.
026:001 "'You shall make for yourselves no idols, neither shall you
        raise up an engraved image or a pillar, neither shall you
        place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it:
        for I am Yahweh your God.
026:002 "'You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary.
        I am Yahweh.
026:003 "'If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments,
        and do them;
026:004 then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land
        shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall
        yield their fruit.
026:005 Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage
        shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread
        to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
026:006 "'I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down,
        and no one will make you afraid; and I will remove evil animals
        out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
026:007 You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you
        by the sword.
026:008 Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall
        chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you
        by the sword.
026:009 "'I will have respect for you, and make you fruitful,
        and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.
026:010 You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall move out
        the old because of the new.
026:011 I will set my tent among you:  and my soul won't abhor you.
026:012 I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will
        be my people.
026:013 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land
        of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; and I have
        broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
026:014 "'But if you will not listen to me, and will not do
        all these commandments;
026:015 and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors
        my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments,
        but break my covenant;
026:016 I also will do this to you:  I will appoint terror over you,
        even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes,
        and make the soul to pine away; and you will sow your seed
        in vain, for your enemies will eat it.
026:017 I will set my face against you, and you will be struck
        before your enemies.  Those who hate you will rule over you;
        and you will flee when no one pursues you.
026:018 "'If you in spite of these things will not listen to me,
        then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
026:019 I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky
        like iron, and your soil like brass;
026:020 and your strength will be spent in vain; for your land won't
        yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land
        yield their fruit.
026:021 "'If you walk contrary to me, and won't listen to me,
        then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according
        to your sins.
026:022 I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you
        of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few
        in number; and your roads will become desolate.
026:023 "'If by these things you won't be reformed to me, but will walk
        contrary to me;
026:024 then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you,
        even I, seven times for your sins.
026:025 I will bring a sword upon you, that will execute the vengeance
        of the covenant; and you will be gathered together within
        your cities:  and I will send the pestilence among you;
        and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
026:026 When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread
        in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight:
        and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.
026:027 "'If you in spite of this won't listen to me, but walk
        contrary to me;
026:028 then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will
        chastise you seven times for your sins.
026:029 You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh
        of your daughters.
026:030 I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars,
        and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols;
        and my soul will abhor you.
026:031 I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries
        to desolation, and I will not take delight in the sweet
        fragrance of your offerings.
026:032 I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies
        that dwell therein will be astonished at it.
026:033 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out
        the sword after you:  and your land will be a desolation,
        and your cities shall be a waste.
026:034 Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies
        desolate and you are in your enemies' land.  Even then the land
        will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
026:035 As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest
        which it didn't have in your sabbaths, when you lived on it.
026:036 "'As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness
        into their hearts in the lands of their enemies:
        and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight;
        and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they
        will fall when no one pursues.
026:037 They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword,
        when no one pursues:  and you will have no power to stand
        before your enemies.
026:038 You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies
        will eat you up.
026:039 Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity
        in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their
        fathers shall they pine away with them.
026:040 "'If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers,
        in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that,
        because they walked contrary to me,
026:041 I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land
        of their enemies:  if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled,
        and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity;
026:042 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my
        covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham;
        and I will remember the land.
026:043 The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its sabbaths
        while it lies desolate without them:  and they will accept
        the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they
        rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
026:044 Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies,
        I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them,
        to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them;
        for I am Yahweh their God;
026:045 but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their
        ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt
        in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God.
        I am Yahweh.'"
026:046 These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made
        between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.
027:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
027:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man
        makes a vow, the persons shall be for Yahweh by your valuation.
027:003 Your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even
        to sixty years old, even your valuation shall be fifty shekels
        of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
027:004 If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
027:005 If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old,
        then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels,
        and for a female ten shekels.
027:006 If the person is from a month old even to five years old,
        then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver,
        and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
027:007 If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if it
        is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels,
        and for a female ten shekels.
027:008 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set
        before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to
        the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.
027:009 "'If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to Yahweh,
        all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.
027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
        for a good:  and if he shall at all change animal for animal,
        then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
027:011 If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer
        as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal
        before the priest;
027:012 and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad.
        As you the priest values it, so shall it be.
027:013 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth
        part of it to its valuation.
027:014 "'When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh,
        then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad:
        as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand.
027:015 If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall
        add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it,
        and it shall be his.
027:016 "'If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession,
        then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it:
        the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty
        shekels of silver.
027:017 If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee,
        according to your valuation it shall stand.
027:018 But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest
        shall reckon to him the money according to the years that
        remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made
        from your valuation.
027:019 If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall
        add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it,
        and it shall remain his.
027:020 If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field
        to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;
027:021 but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy
        to Yahweh, as a field devoted; it shall be owned by the priests.
027:022 "'If he dedicates to Yahweh a field which he has bought,
        which is not of the field of his possession,
027:023 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation
        up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation
        on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.
027:024 In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from
        whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession
        of the land belongs.
027:025 All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of
        the sanctuary:  twenty gerahs to the shekel.
027:026 "'Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn
        to Yahweh, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep,
        it is Yahweh's.
027:027 If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according
        to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it:
        or if it isn't redeemed, then it shall be sold according
        to your valuation.
027:028 "'Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote
        to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal,
        or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed:
        every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.
027:029 "'No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men,
        shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
027:030 "'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land
        or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh's. It is holy to Yahweh.
027:031 If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth
        part to it.
027:032 All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes
        under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.
027:033 He shall not search whether it is good or bad,
        neither shall he change it:  and if he changes it at all,
        then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
        It shall not be redeemed.'"
027:034 These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses
        for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
