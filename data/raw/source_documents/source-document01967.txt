  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXTRACTS FROM MORE THAN 1,000 ENDORSEMENTS OF THIS
  VOLUME:--

  To me at least, it will be an authority. A book of permanent value, not
  milk for babes but strong meat for men.--_Ex-Pres. T.D. Woolsey_.

  Fills an important place in History, not before occupied.--_Wm. M.
  Everts, N.Y._

  The maps themselves are a History, invaluable, and never before
  supplied.--_Henry Day, N.Y._

  An entirely new field of Historical labor. A splendid volume, the result
  of careful research, with the advantage of military experience.--_Geo.
  Bancroft_.

  It is an absolute necessity in our literature. No one can understand the
  philosophy of the old War for Independence, until he has made a careful
  and thoughtful perusal of this work.--_Benson J. Lossing_.

  The maps are just splendid.--_Adj. Gen. W.L. Stryker, N.J._

  The book is invaluable and should be in every library.--_Wm. L. Stone,
  N.Y._

  Of permanent standard authority.--_Gen. De Peister, N.Y._

  Indicates such profound erudition and ability in the discussion as
  leaves nothing to be desired.--_Sen. Oscar de La Fayette, Paris_.

  I have read the volume with pleasure and profit.--_Z. Chandler_.

  The volume is superb and will give the author enduring fame.--_B.
  Gratz Brown, St. Louis_.

  It should have a place in every gentleman's library, and is just the
  book which young men of Great Britain and America should know by
  heart.--_London Telegraph_.

  The most impartial criticism on military affairs in this country which
  the century has produced.--_Army and Navy Journal_.

  Fills in a definite form that which has hitherto been a somewhat vague
  period of military history.--_Col. Hamley, Pres., Queen's Staff
  College, England_.

  A valuable addition to my library at Knowlsy.--_Lord Derby, late Brit.
  Sec. of State_.

  A magnificent volume and a monument of national History.--_A. de
  Rochambeau, Paris_.

  Magazine_.
