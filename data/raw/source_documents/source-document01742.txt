2 _Cap_. Away, good pilchers![211]
Now blow your matches and stand fast: he comes here.

1 _Cap_. And now bend all your pikes.

    _Enter Provost, Barnavelt, Lords, Guard.
    (A Scaffold put out) Executioner_.

_Prov_. Cleere all the Skaffold;
Let no more into th'Court; we are choakd with people.

_Bar_. You are curteous in your preparations, gentlemen,

1 _Lord_. You must ascend, Sir.

_Bar_. Feareles I will, my lords,
And, what you can inflict, as feareles suffer.
Thus high you raise me, a most glorious kindnes
For all my Cares! For my most faithfull service
For you and for the State thus ye promote me!
I thanck ye, Cuntrymen, most nobely thanck ye.
--Pull of my Gowne. Of what place are ye, frend?

_Exec_. Of _Utrich_, Sir.

_Bar_. Of _Utrich_! Wherefore, prethee,
Art thou appointed here?

_Exec_. To tell you true, Sir,
I won this place at dyce: we were three appointed.

_Bar_. Am I becom a generall game? a Rest[212]
For every Slave to pull at? Thanck ye still:
You are growne the noblest in your favours, gentlemen.
--What's that hangs there? what Coffin?

_Lord_. How it stirrs him.

2 _Lord_. The body, Sir, of _Leidenberch_[213] the Traitour.

_Bar_. The traitour?

2 _Lord_. I, the Traitour, the fowle Traitour,
Who, though he killd himself to cleere his cause,
Justice has found him out and so proclaimd him.

_Bar_. Have mercy on his soule! I dare behold him.

1 _Lord_. Beleeve me, he's much moved.

2 _Lord_. He has much reason.

_Bar_. Are theis the holly praires ye prepare for me--
The comforts to a parting soule? Still I thanck ye,
Most hartely and lovingly I thanck ye.
Will not a single death give satisfaction,
O you most greedy men and most ungratefull,--
The quiet sleep of him you gape to swallow,
But you must trym up death in all his terrors
And add to soules departing frights and feavors?
Hang up a hundred Coffins; I dare view 'em,
And on their heads subscribe a hundred treasons
It shakes not me, thus dare I smile upon 'em
And strongly thus outlooke your fellest Justice.

2 _Lord_. Will ye bethinck ye, Sir, of what ye come for.

_Bar_. I come to dye: bethinck you of your Justice
And with what Sword ye strike, the edge of mallice.
Bethinck ye of the travells I had for ye,
The throaes and grones to bring faire peace amongst ye;
Bethinck ye of the dangers I have plundgd through
And almost gripes of death, to make you glorious.
Thinck when the Cuntry, like a Wildernes,
Brought nothing forth but desolation,
Fire, Sword and Famine; when the earth sweatt under ye
Cold dewes of blood, and _Spanish_ flames hoong ore ye,
And every man stood markt the child of murder
And women wanted wombes to feed theis cruelties;--
Thinck then who stept in to you, gently tooke ye
And bound your bleeding wounds up; from your faces
Wipd of the sweatts of sorrow, fed and nurssd ye;
Who brought the plowgh againe to crowne your plenty;
Your goodly meadowes who protected (Cuntrymen)
From the armd Soldiers furious marches; who
Unbard the Havens that the floating Merchant
Might clap his lynnen wings up to the windes
And back the raging waves to bring you proffit.
Thinck through whose care you are a Nation
And have a name yet left,--a fruitfull Nation
(Would I could say as thanckfull)--bethinck ye of theis things
And then turne back and blush, blush [for] my ruyne.

1 _Lord_. 'Tis strange how this [man b]rags; 'tis a strange impudence
Not to be pittied in his [case], not sufferd.
You breed the peace, you bring the plowgh againe?
You wipe the fire and blood of from this Cuntry,
And you restore hir to hir former Beuty?
Blush in thine age, bad man; thy grave blush for thee
And scorne to hide that man that holds no Creadit.
Beare witnes all the world that knowes our Trobles
Or ever greiv'd our plagues, what we have sufferd
And, under Heaven, by what armes we have cur'd theis,--
Councells and frends; in which I tell thee (_Barnavelt_),
And through thy Impudence I here proclaime it,
Thou hadst the least and last share. 'Tis not your face, Sir,
The greatnes of your friends, corruptly purchast,
The Crying up of your manie Services,
Which lookd into wither away like Mushrumps,
Shall scandall us.

2 _Lord_. Your _Romaine_ end, to make men
Imagine your strong conscience fortifide,
No, nor your ground Religion. Examine all men
Branded with such fowle syns as you now dye for,
And you shall find their first stepp still Religion.
_Gowrie_ in _Scotland_, 'twas his maine pretention:
Was not he honest, too? his Cuntries father?
Those fyery Speritts next that hatchd in _England_
That bloody Powder-Plot, and thought like meteors
To have flashd their Cuntryes peace out in a Moment:
Were not their Barrells loden with Religion?
Were not they pious, iust and zealous Subiects?
Humble your soule for shame, and seeke not now, Sir,
To tumble from that happines even Angells
Were throwne from for their pride. Confes, and dye well.

1 _Lord_. Will ye confes your faultes?

_Bar_. I come not heather
To make myself guilty; yet one fault I must utter,
And 'tis a great one.

2 _Lord_. The greater mercy.

_Bar_. I dye for saving this unthanckfull Cuntry.

1 _Lord_. Play not with heaven.

_Bar_. My Game's as sure as yours is,
And with more care and inocence I play it.
Take of my doblet; and I prethee, fellow,
Strike without feare.

_Exec_. I warrant ile fitt ye.
I pray forgive me, Sir.

_Bar_. Most hartely,
And heer's my hand. I love thee, too: thy physick
Will quickly purge me from the worldes abuses.
When I speak lowdest, strike.

_Exec_. I shall observe ye.

_Bar_. Farwell, my lords: to all your Counsailes fortune,
Happie succes and proffit; peace to this Cuntry;
And to you all, that I have bredd like children,
Not a more faithfull father but more fortunate.
Doe not I stay too long?

2 _Lord_. Take your owne time, Sir.

_Bar_. I have a wiffe, my lords, and wretched children,
Unles it please his Grace to looke upon 'em
And your good honours with your eies of favour.
'Twill be a litle happines in my death
That they partake not with their fathers ruyns.

1 _Lord_. Let not that troble ye: they shall not find it.

_Bar_. Commend my last breath to his Excellence;
Tell him the Sun he shot at is now setting,
Setting this night, that he may rise to morrow,
For ever setting. Now let him raigne alone
And with his rayes give life and light to all men.
May he protect with honour, fight with fortune,
And dye with generall love, an old and good Prince.
My last petition, good Cuntrymen, forget me:
Your memories wound deeper then your mallice,
And I forgive ye all.--A litle stay me.--
Honour and world I fling ye thus behind me,
And thus a naked poore man kneele to heaven:
Be gracious to me, heare me, strengthen me.
I come, I come, ô gracious heaven! now, now,
Now, I present--

_Exec_. Is it well don mine Heeres?

1 _Lord_. Somewhat too much; you have strooke his fingers, too,
But we forgive your haste. Draw in the body;
And Captaines, we discharge your Companies.

_Vand_. Make cleere the Court.--Vaine glory, thou art gon!
And thus must all build on Ambition.

2 _Lord_. Farwell, great hart; full low thy strength now lyes:
He that would purge ambition this way dies.

                                   _Exeunt_.


INTRODUCTION TO _CAPTAIN UNDERWIT_.


This anonymous Comedy is printed, for the first time, from Harl. MS.
7,650,--a small quarto of eighty-nine leaves. I have followed Halliwell
(Dictionary of Old Plays) in adopting the title, Captain _Underwit_.
There is no title-page to the MS.

An editor with plenty of leisure on his hands would find ample
opportunities in Captain _Underwit_ for discursive comment. Sometimes I
have been obliged to pass over odd phrases and out-of-the-way allusions
without a line of explanation; but in the index at the end of the fourth
volume I hope to settle some difficulties that at present are left
standing.

The date of the play I take to be circ. 1640 or 1642. In I. 1 there is a
mention of the "league at _Barwick_ and the late expeditions," where the
reference can only be to Charles I.'s march into Scotland in the spring
of 1639, and to the so-called Pacification of _Berwick_. Again, in III.
3, there is an allusion to the Newmarket Cup. Historians of the Turf say
that Newmarket races date from 1640; but this statement is incorrect,
for in Shirley's _Hyde Park_ (V. 1),--a play licensed in 1632 and
printed in 1637,--mention is made of a certain "Bay _Tarrall_ that won
the Cup at Newmarket." We find also an allusion to the "great ship"
(III. 3), which was built in 1637. Of Mr. Adson's "new ayres" (IV. 1) I
know very little. He brought out in 1621 a volume of "Courtly Masquing
Ayres," but published nothing later,--although, of course, he may have
continued writing long afterwards. Hawkins and Mr. Chappell are
altogether silent about Adson's achievements.

Gerard Langbaine tells us that Shirley left at his death some plays in
manuscript: I have little doubt, or rather no doubt at all, that Captain
_Underwit_ is one of them. In the notes I have pointed out several
parallelisms to passages in Shirley's plays; and occasionally we find
actual repetitions, word for word. But apart from these strong proofs,
it would be plain from internal evidence that the present piece is a
domestic comedy of Shirley's, written in close imitation of Ben Jonson.
All the characters are old acquaintances. Sir Richard Huntlove, who
longs to be among his own tenants and eat his own beef in the country;
his lady, who loves the pleasures of the town, balls in the Strand, and
masques; Device, the fantastic gallant,--these are well-known figures in
Shirley's plays. No other playwright of that day could have given us
such exquisite poetry as we find in Captain _Underwit_. The briskness,
too, and cleverness of the dialogue closely recall Shirley; but it must
be owned that there are few plays of Shirley's written with such
freedom, not to say grossness.


[CAPTAIN UNDERWIT, A COMEDY.]


_Act the First_.


    _Enter Captaine Underwit and his man Thomas_.

_Un_. Come, my man _Thomas_, and my fathers old man _Thomas_; reioyce,
I say, and triumph: thy Master is honourable.

_Tho_. Then wee are all made.

_Un_. No, tis only I am made.

_Tho_. What, and please your worship?

_Un_. I am made a Captaine of the traind band,[214] _Thomas_, and this
is my Commission, this very paper hath made me a Captaine.

_Tho_. Are you a paper Captaine, Sir? I thought more had gone to the
makeing up of a Captaine.

_Un_. They are fooles that thinke so, provided he have the favour of the
Livetenant of the County.

_Tho_. Which it seemes you have.

_Un_. The honour of it is more then the thing, _Thomas_, since I did
not bribe the Secretarys steward or what servant else so ever hath the
government of his Lordship therein.

_Tho_. This is very strange.

_Un_. Not so much as transitorie wicker bottles to his Deputy
Livetenant, no fewell for his winter, no carriages for his summer, no
steple sugarloaves to sweeten his neighbours at Christmas, no robbing my
brave tennants of their fatt Capons or Chickens to present his worship
withall, _Thomas_.

_Tho_. I cry your worship mercy, you sold him land the last terme; I had
forgott that.

_Un_. I, that lay convenient for him. I us'd him like a gentleman and
tooke litle or nothing; 'twere pitty two or three hundred acres of dirt
should make friends fall out: we should have gone to fenceing schools.

_Tho_. How, sir?

_Un_. I meane to _Westminster_ hall, and let one another blood in Lawe.

_Tho_. And so the Land has parted you?

_Un_. Thou saist right, _Thomas_, it lies betweene both our houses
indeed. But now I am thus dignified (I thinke that's a good word) or
intituled is better, but tis all one; since I am made a Captaine--

_Tho_. By your owne desert and vertue.

_Un_. Thou art deceavd; it is by vertue of the Commission,--the
Commission is enough to make any man an officer without desert;
_Thomas_, I must thinke how to provide mee of warlike accoutrements to
accomodate, which comes of Accomodo[215]: _Shakespeare_. The first, and
the first--

_Tho_. No, Sir, it comes of so much money disburs'd.

_Un_. In troth, and it does, _Thomas_; but take out your table bookes
and remember to bring after me into the Country, for I will goe downe
with my father in law Sir _Richard_ this morning in the Coach,--let me
see--first and formost: a Buff Coate and a paire of breeches.

_Tho_. First and formost: Item, a Buff Coate fox and a paire of breeches
of the same Cloth.

_Un_. A paire of bootes and spurres, and a paire of shooes without
spurres.

_Tho_. Spurres.

_Un_. A paire of gray stockins, thick dapple gray stockins, with a belt,
to be worne either about my shoulder or about my wast.

_Tho_. Wast.

_Un_. A _London Dutch_ felt without a band, with a feather in't.

_Tho_. Without a feather in't.

_Un_. An old fox[216] blade made at _Hounsloe_ heath, and then all the
Bookes to be bought of warlike discipline, which the learned call
Tacticks.

_Tho_. Ticktacks.[217]--If your worship would take my Counsell,
considering the league at _Barwick_[218] and the late expeditions, wee
may find some of these things in the North or else speake with some
reform'd Captaine, though he bee a Catholike; and it may bee wee may
have them at cheaper rates.

_Un_. 'Tis true, Thomas: but I must change the lynings of the breeches,
for I love to bee cleanly.

_Tho_. So you may, Sir; and have the fowling of them yourselfe.

_Un_. Let me see: A leading staff--

_Tho_. A leaden staffe--

_Un_. A lead'ing staffe.

_Tho_.--ding staffe. Why, a Cane is a leading staffe in a Captaines
hand.

_Un_. But I must have tassells, _Thomas_, and such things.

_Tho_. At the harnesse of the Carthorses there are tassells and Bells,
too, if you will.

_Un_. Bells? What should I doe with em?

_Tho_. Ring all your companie in.

_Un_. Thou would'st make me a Captaine of a Morris dance. What serve the
phifes and Drumms for, prethee?

_Tho_. But does your worship thinke you shall endure the bouncing of the
Gunns? I observed you ever kept a way of at the Musters.

_Un_. Thou shalt therefore every morne goe a birding about the house to
inure me to the report. By that tyme thou hast kild all my pigeons I
shall endure the noise well enough.

_Tho_. But, Sir, you must have a dry Nurse, as many Captaines have. Let
me see: I can hire you an old limping decayed Sergeant at _Brainford_
that taught the boyes,--he that had his beard sing'd of at the last
Muster: hee'le doe it bravely.

_Un_. What must he have?

_Tho_. Alas, twenty pipes[219] of _Barmudas_ a day, six flagons of
March[220] beere, a quart of Sack in a weeke, for he scornes meate; and
the kitching wench to bring the shirt to him and the only band, for
Cuffs he gets none but such as his drunkennes procures him with
quarrelling.

_Un_. No, I shall be bashfull to learne of a stranger, thou sha't goe
seeke out Captaine _Sackburye_.

_Tho_. He that weares no money in his scarlett hose, and when he is
drunke is infected with Counsell?

_Un_. The very same; you shall find him at his Lodging in _Fleetstreet_
or in the next taverne. Give him this Letter; tell him I desire his
Companie this summer in the Country. He shall have a horse of mine,
say:--here, give him this gold, too.

_Tho_. I hope it is gameing gold.

_Un_. He shall read warres to me and fortification.

_Tho_. I can teach you to build a sconce[221], sir.

_Un_. Beside, he is very valiant; he beate me twice when he was drunk,
but, poore fellow, I ask'd him forgivenes the next day. Make hast, good
_Thomas_, and remember all the Tacticks.

_Tho_. I warrant you, Sir: I know 'em well enough.    [_Exit_.

_Un_. So, so; here's Sir _Richard_.

    _Enter Sir Richrd Huntlove, his Ladie and Mistresse Dorothy_.

_Sir Rich_. Me thinkes you looke more sprightly since you were made a
Captaine.

_Un_. Oh, good Sir _Richard_, indeed my face is the worst part about mee;
and yet it will serve at the Muster.

_Do_. Serve! With reverence to the title, I have seene a Generall with a
worse Countenance. It is a good leading face, and though you have no cut
ore the nose or other visible scarre, which I doubt not but you may
receave all in good tyme, it is a quarrelling face and fitt for a man of
warre.

_Un_. I thanke you, sweet mistress _Dorothy_: I will commend you as much
when you are in the Countrey.--But doe you resolve to goe downe this
morning, Sir?

_Sir Rich_. By all meanes: is your sister readie? bid the Coachman make
hast, and have a care you leave none of your trinketts behind: after a
little dialogue with my scrivenour Ile returne, and then to Coach.

_Lady_. But why this expedition, this posting out of towne as the Aire
were infected?

_Sir Rich_. The[222] truth is, my sweet Ladie, we have no Exchange in
the Country, no playes, no Masques, no Lord Maiors day, no gulls nor
gallifoists[223]. Not so many Ladies to visit and weare out my Coach
wheeles, no dainty Madams in Childbedd to set you a longing when you
come home to lie in with the same fashion'd Curtaines and hangings, such
curious silver Andirons, Cupbord of plate and pictures. You may goe to
Church in the Countrey without a new Satten gowne, and play at penny
gleeke[224] with a Justice of peaces wife and the parsons; show your
white hand with but one Diamond when you carve and not be asham'd to
weare your owne wedding ring with the old poesie. There are no Doctors
to make you sick wife; no legends of lies brought home by yong gallants
that fill my Dyning roome with fleas and new fashions, that will write
verses upon the handle of your fanne and comend the education of your
Monkey, which is so like their worships as they were all of one familie.
I have no humour to provokeing meates; I will downe and enter into a
Christian diett, Madam. There is sport in killing my owne partridge and
pheasant; my Trowtes will cost me less than your Lobsters and crayfish
drest with amber greece[225], and I may renew my acquaintance with
mutton and bold chines of beefe; entertaine my tenants, that would pay
for my housekeeping all the yeere and thanke my worship at Christmas,
over and above their rents, with Turkies and Beeves of supererogation.
You may guesse I have some reason to change the aire, wife, and so I
leave you to prepare your selfe: You have my purpose and may expect mee.
                                                                [_Exit_.

_Lady_. However he may pretend, and point at charge
Which makes his stay unpleasant, 'tis his Jelousie
That strikes him into wildnes and dislike
Of all things here: he does not use mee well.
--Where is my sister?

_Do_. In the Closet, Madam.
--I must waite upon my Ladie, sweete Captaine.

                     [_Exeunt Lady & Dorothy_.

_Un_. This Wench has a notable witt, if I have any Judgment: I doe not
thinke but shee's in love with me. If I thought shee were not given to
be with child I would examine her abilities; but these waiting women are
so fruitfull, when they have a good turne from a gentleman they have not
the vertue of concealment: touch a Chambermaide and take a Child,
--everything workes with their soluble bodies.

    _Enter Monsir Device_.

_De_. Noble Mr. _Underwitt_!

_Un_. I know not whome you meane, sir: he that comands the family in
chiefe, hath been honor'd with a sword and "rise Sir _Richard_" (who is
but my father in lawe[226] to a[nd?] by a former wife): for Mr.
_Underwitt_, whome to salute you humbled your Cloth a gold Dublet, I ken
not the wight.

_De_. Doe not you know mee, noble Sir?

_Un_. Upon even tearmes I may call your name to memorie, but if you
understand not my addition[227] it is honourable to forgett the best
friend I have.

_De_. What's the mistry of this? Your addition? pray honour me to
know it.

_Un_. He that was Mr. _Underwit_ is made a Captaine; you may, if you
please, take notice of his title.

_De_. I beg your mercy, noble Captaine, and congratulate your addition
of honour. It was Ignorance which, I professe, made me salute you with a
wrong preface. Now, Capt., I shall bee proud to march under the ensigne
of your favour.

_Un_. Friend _Device_, how does thy body? I am thy vassall; servant is
for porters, watermen & lacquies, & is no witt neither. You preserve
your tropes and your elegancies? What fancies doe adorne to-day? If I
were a Constable I might apprehend you for suspition you had robd a
pedlar. Does this thatchd cottage head hold still in fashion? What paid
you for this dead mans hair? Where's your night rail[228]? The last time
I saw you was in _Fleetstreet_, when at Complement and bare to an other
gentleman. I tooke him for a Barber and I thought you by the wide lynnen
about your neck [to] have been under correction in the suds[229], sir.

_De_. Wee are govern'd by the Mode, as waters by the Moone; but there
are more changes in th'one than t'other. But does your Comand extend
to the Sea or the land service?

_Un_. I never see the Sea in my life, sir, nor intend it.

_De_. You are not the first Captaine that has seene no service: 'tis
time lost to travell for't when a man may bee a Comander at home. I
never traveld myselfe.

_Un_. No, Sir?

_De_. And yet I understand garbes, from the elevation of your pole to
the most humble galosh.

_Un_. Can your hanches play well in these close cut breeches? they want
but a pummell to distinguish 'em from Trouses[230].

_De_. O sir, there is a perfect geometry in these breeches; you doe not
observe the morality of your fancie, nor the gentile play and poize of
your Lemon, Orange or Melon: this is gentry. Why, I understand all the
curiosities of the Mode to a Mathematicall point, and yet I never
travaild in all my life for't.

_Un_. These are extraordinary parts. Alas, a Captaine has but fifty or a
hundred at most to looke after, and all they have not so much witt as
your _French_ Lacquey. And what need any travaile to instruct them? I
can teach them their motions by word of mouth: when they come to fight,
my Countrymen will retreate naturally.

    _Enter Ladie and her Sister_.

_Lady_. Now in revenge could I bee rich, but that
I would not be a prisoner to my Chamber.
These superstitions will make women doe
Strange things sometymes.

_Sis_. Of whome doe you thinke he should be jealous, sister?

_Lady_. Of Duke _Eneas_ in the hanging.

_Sis_. I hope he has no suspition of my servants,
That, under the pretence of formall Courtship
To mee, should ayme at his dishonour: there's
One that would weare my livery.

_Lady_. _Device_?
Hang him, outside! no, my husband loves
His folly and would have him the state foole,
His garbes are so ridiculous.

_Sis_. What opinion
(Still with a confidence of your cleere thoughts)
Holdes he of the Knight Sir _Francis Courtwell_,
That often visits us?

_Lady_. Sure a Noble one,
If I may aske my Innocence; yet I find
Him very amorous. O my husband loves him;
He is a powerfull man at Court, whose friendship
Is worth preserving. Sister, I confesse
His nobleness and person hath prevaild
With mee to give him still the freest welcome
My modestie and honor would permitt;
But if I thought my husband had a scruple
His visits were not honourable, I
Should soone declare how much I wish his absence.

_Un_. Your Mistresse and my Lady; I have some
Affaires require despatch, ile leave you to 'em.    [_Exit_.

_Sis_. My witty servant!

_Lady_. Most pretious Alamode, Monsir _Device_!

_De_. I blesse my lipps with your white handes.

_Lady_. You come to take your leave as knowing by instinct wee have but
halfe an hour to stay.

_Sis_. Wee are for the Countrey as fast as your _Flanders_ mares will
trott, sir.

_De_. That's a Solecisme till the Court remove;--are you afraid of the
small pox?

_Sis_. The less the better for a gentlewoman.

_De_. And the greater more genty for a Cavallier. By this glove (a
pretty embroidery is't not?) you must not deprive us so soone of your
sweet presence. Why, there's a Ball to night in the _Strand_ and
tomorrow I had a purpose to waite upon you to the pictures; I ha'
bespoke regalias[231] there, too. There will be a new play shortly,
a pretty Comedy written by a profest Scholler: he scornes to take
money[232] for his witt, as the Poetts doe.

_Lady_. He is Charitable to the Actors.

_Sis_. It may be their repentance enough to play it.

_De_. You must needs stay and give your opinion.
What will become of me when you are gon, Ladie?

_Lady_. If your devotion catch not cold you may breath your _Barbary_
and visit us, where you may be confident of your welcome.

_De_. I dare as soone doubt I was Christned. But pray let us visit the
Exchange and take a trifle to weare for my sake before you goe. What
say, Madam? my owne Coach is at dore, the lyning is very rich and the
horses are very well matcht.

_Lady_. Alas, wee expect upon my husbands returne to take Coach
imediatlie.

_Sis_. But if wee see you in the Countrey you will doe us an honour?

_De_. You invite me to my happines. I can play well o' the kittar; I
thinke your musique is but course there; wee'le have a Countrey dance
after supper and a song. I can talke loud to a Theorbo[233], too, and
thats cald singing. Now, yee shall heare my Ballet.

_Sis_. Did you make a Ballet?

_De_. Oh I, the greatest wit lies that way now; a pittifull Complaint of
the Ladies when they were banish'd the Towne[234] with their husbands to
their Countrey houses, compeld to change the deere delight of Maske and
Revells here for Wassail and windie bagpipes; instead of Silken Fairies
tripping in the Banquetting Roome, to see the Clownes sell fish in the
hall and ride the wild mare, and such Olimpicks, till the ploughman
breake his Crupper, at which the Villagers and plumporidge men boile
over while the Dairy maid laments the defect of his Chine and he, poore
man, disabled for the trick, endeavours to stifle the noise and company
with perfume of sweat instead of Rose water.

_Lady_. This must be our Countrey recreation, too!

    _Enter Sir Francis Courtwell_.

_De_. Who is this?

_Lady_. 'Tis Sir _Francis Courtwell_;
You cannot choose but know him.--This must bee
A favour, Sir, to visit us at parting.

_Sir Fr_. I came with other expectation, Madam,
Then to heare this: I could receave no newes
So unwelcome. What misfortune doth conclude
The Towne so unhappie?

_Lady_. 'Tis my husbands pleasure,
Affrighted with some Dreame he had last night;
For I can guess no other cause.

_Sir Fr_. Could hee
Bee capable of fright and you so neere him?

_De_. He cannot choose but know me then.--Sir, I kisse your noble hand
and shall be stellified in your knowledge.

_Sir Fr_. What thing's this that looks so like a race Nagg trick'd with
ribbands?

_Sis_. He is one of my inamoratos, Sir;
They call him Mounsir _Device_.

_Sir Fr_. Lady, your faire excuse.--He has, it seemes,
Some confidence to prevaile upon your liking
That he hath bought so many Bride laces.

_Sis_. You may interpret him a walking mirth.

_Sir Fr_. He moves upon some skrues and may be kinsman
To the engine that is drawne about with Cakebread,
But that his outside's brighter.

_De_. Sir _Francis Courtwell_.

_Sir Fr_. That's my name, Sir.

_De_. And myne Mounsieur _Device_.

_Sir Fr_. A _Frenchman_ Sir?

_De_. No, sir; an _English_ Monsier made up by a _Scotch_ taylor that
was prentice in _France_. I shall write my greatest ambition satisfied
if you please to lay your Comands upon mee.

_Sir Fr_. Sweet lady, I beseech you mussell your beagle; I dare not
trust my selfe with his folly, and he may deserve more beating then I am
willing to bestow at this tyme.

_Sis_. Take truce a little, servant.

_Sir Fr_. Will you consider, Madam, yet how much
A wounded hart may suffer?

_Lady_. Still the old businesse;
Indeede you make me blush, but I forgive you
If you will promise to sollicite this
Unwelcome cause no more.

_Sir Fr_. 'Tis my desire;
I take no pleasure in a pilgrimage.
If you instruct a nearer way, 'tis in
Your will to save your eare the trouble of
My pleading, Madam, if with one soft breath
You say I'me entertain'd; but for one smile
That speakes consent you'le make my life your servant.

_Lady_. My husband, Sir--

_Sir Fr_. Deserves not such a treasure to himselfe
And starve a noble servant.

_Lady_. You but pleade
For vanitie: desist, for if I could
(Forgetting honour and my modestie)
Allow your wild desires, it were impossible
That wee should meete more then in thought and shadowes.

_Sir Fr_. If these shadowes, Madam, be but darke enough,
I shall account it happines to meet you.
But referr that to opportunitie,
Which our kind starrs in pitty will sooner offer
To both our ioyes.

_Lady_. But he is very Jealous.

_Sir Fr_. That word assures my victorie; I never
Heard any wife accuse her husband of
Or cold neglect or Jealousie, but she had
A confirm'd thought within to trick his forehead--
It is but Justice, Madam, to reward him
For his suspitious thoughts.

_Lady_. D'ee thinke it fitt
To punish his suspition yet perswade
To act the sinne he feares?

_Sir Fr_. Custome and nature make it less offence
In women to comitt the deed of pleasure
Then men to doubt their chastity; this flowing
From poison'd natures, that excus'd by fraielty.
Yet I have heard the way to cure the scare
Has bin the deed; at truth the scruples vanish.
I speake not, Madam, with a thought to suffer
A foule breath whisper your white name; for he
That dares traduce it must beleeve me dead,
Or my fame twisted with your honour must not
Have pitty on the Accusers blood.

_Device_. I will attend you in the Countrey;
I take my leave and kiss your ivory hand;
Madam, and yours. Sir _Francis_, your obliged.
                                          [_Exit_.

_Sir Fr_. You bless me with this promise.
--How can you, lady, suffer this impertinent
Afflict you thus?
                                       [_Ex. Lad_.

_Sis_. Alas, my parrat's dead and he supplies the prattle: ith' spring
and fall he will save me charge of phisick in purgeing Melancholy.

_Sir Fr_. If you dare
Accept a servant, Ladie, upon my
Comends, I should present a kinsman t'ee
Who sha'not want a fortune nor, I hope,
A meritt to possesse your faire opinion.

_Sis_. You doe not say he is hansome all this while, and that's a maine
consideration. I wod not have a man so tall as a Mast, that I must clyme
the shroudes to kisse him, nor so much a dwarfe that I must use a
multiplying glass to know the proportion of his limbes. A great man is a
great house with too much garret and his head full of nothing but
lumber: if he be too round agen hees only fitt to be hung upp in a
Christall glasse. The truth is the man I love must please me at first
sight; if he take my eye I may take more tyme to examine his talent.

_Sir Fr_. Do you but grace him with accesse and aske your owne fancie,
Ladie, how you can affect him. Ile not despaire if he were cur'd of
modesty, which is the whole fault in his behaviour; but he may passe
without contempt.

_Do_. That modestie is a foule fault.

    _Enter Captaine Underwitt_.

_Un_. Come away, Cosen; Sir _Richard's_ come and calls for you; the
Coachman is ready to mount. Noble Sir _Richard_, because you may not
loose breath, you may call me a Captaine, please you, a Captaine o' the
train'd band.

_Sis_. 'Tis very certaine.

_Sir Fr_. I congratulate your title, Sir.

_Un_. If you come into the Countrey you shall see me doe as much with my
leading staff as another.

_Sir Fr_. You wonot thrash your men?

_Un_. If I did 'tis not the first time I ha thrash'd. If I find my
Souldiers tractable they shall find me but a reasonable Captaine.

    _Enter Sir Richard [and] Lady_.

_Sir Rich_. Sir _Francis_, I am sorrie the violence of my affaires wonot
let me entertaine you to my wishes. Pray honour us with your presence in
the Countrey, if you can dispence with your employments, when I shall
satisfie for this haste of my departure.

_Sir Fr_. I shall attend you, Sir, and present a kinsman of mine to this
virgin Ladie: he is like to be Master of no narrow fortune. It was my
busines at this tyme only to prepare his accesse.

_Sir Rich_. He shall have my vote for your sake, Sir _Francis_. Come,
Madam.

_Sir Fr_. Ile waite upon you to the Coach and take my leave.

_Un_. Sweet Mistresse _Doritye_.

                                    [_Exeunt_.


_Act the Second_.


    _Enter Captaine Sackburie, reading a Letter, and Thomas_.

_Capt_. Hum--hum--Where's the gold?

_Tho_. Here, Sir; one, two, three, fowre, and five.

_Cap_. Thou hast learnd the Cinque pace[235], _Tho_: is the gold weight?

_Tho_. I hope so, Sir.

_Cap_. Hum--into the Country;--thou hast a horse, too?

_Tho_. Not about me, Sir, but he is ready, all but brideling and
sadling, at our Inne, Captaine. My master sayes you shalbe troubled with
no horse but his.

_Cap_. Why, is he lame?

_Tho_. What? _Truehunt_, the black nag with three white feete? he lame?
You meane that I ride upon my selfe.

_Cap_. Hum,--'make hast as you will preserve the reputation of your true
friend and servant:'--so, so--Comend me to him, _Thomas_; I wonot faile
to visit him.

_Tho_. You may demand the Nag, if you ask for _Humfrey_ the Ostler, by
the same token he has bin there this foure dayes and had but one peck of
provender.

_Cap_. Enough I wonot faile, I say. Farewell, honest _Tom a
Lincolne_, farewell: comend me to the traind band.

_Tho_. Pray doe not fall a drinking and forgett it: bu'oy[236], noble
Captaine.
             [_Exit_.

    _Enter Mr. Courtwell_.

_Cap_. My expectation of the Lawz well mett!

_Cou_. I am glad to see you, Captaine.

_Cap_. Is thy sight perfect?
Thy poring upon statutes and booke cases
Makes me suspecte. But dost thou thinke to bee
A Dominus factotum on the Bench,
And be a Civill Lawyer?

_Cou_. You are merry.

_Cap_. Tis more then thou hast been this twelvemonth: th'ast
Lost thy Complexion with too much study.
Why, thou shalt be an heire and rule the rost
Of halfe a shire, and thy father would but Dye once;
Come to the Sizes with a band of Janisaries
To equall the Grand Signor, all thy tenants,
That shall at their owne charge make themselves fine
And march like Cavaliers with tilting feathers,
Gaudy as _Agamemnons_[237] in the play:
After whome thou, like _St. George_ a horseback
Or the high Sheriff, shall make the Cuntrey people
Fall downe in adoration of thy Crooper
And silver stirrup, my right worshipfull.
A pox a buckram and the baggage in't!
Papers defil'd with Court hand and long dashes,
Or Secretarie lines that stradle more
Then _Frenchmen_ and lesse wholsome to the Client.
Is thy head to be fild with Proclamations,
Rejoynders and hard words beyond the _Alchemist_[238]?
Be ruld, and live like a fine gentleman
That may have haukes and hounds and whores and horses,
And then thou art fitt Companie.

_Cou_. You talke wildlie;
I wou'd you saw your Errour that place all
Your happinesse upon such course delights.
I should degenerate too much and forfet
My education.

_Cap_. Education! he has gott a tune:
I doe not thinke but thou wilt leave thy law
And exercise thy talent in composeing
Some treatises against long haire and drinking
That most unchristian weed yclipt tobacco;
Preach to the puisnes[239] of the Inne sobrietie,
And abstinence from shaveing of lewd Baylies
That will come shortlie to your Chamber doores
And there with reverence entreat your worships
Come forth and be arrested,--precious tappoles!
I wo'd not willingly despaire of thee,
For thy Lands sake and cause I am thy Countreyman.
One generous Vagarie, and thou wer't wise,
Would breake somebodies hart within a sennight,
And then th'art Lord of all. Have but the grace
To dine wo' mee at taverne and ile tell
Thy friends there is some hope.

_Cou_. My friends?

_Cap_. Thy father's
In _Essex_: if he live heele purchase _Romford_;
If he die sooner then the towne's our owne;
Spend but an acre a day and thou maist live
Till all the world be wearie of thee. Betweene
Us two, what thincke you of a wench?

_Cou_. Nothing.

_Cap_. You meane one wench betweene us two is nothing.
I know a hundred Leverets[240], things that will
Bound like a dancer on the rope and kiss thee
Into thy naturall complexion:
A sinner that shall clime thee like a squirrell.

_Cou_. And crack me like a Nutt. I ha no kernell
To spare for her sweet tooth.

_Cap_. That was a metaphor: hee's not desperate!

_Cou_. Buoy, my deere Captaine.

_Cap_. Wy, farewell, Countreyman:
I may live yet to witnes thy conversion.    [_Exit_.

    _Enter a Footeman_.

_Cou_. How does my uncle?

_Fo_. He desires presentlie
To speake with you at his lodging.

_Cou_. Ile attend him.

                          [_Exit_.


[SCENE 2.]


    _Enter Captaine Underwit and Thomas_.

_Un_. And hast thou been carefull of all those things I gave charge
to be provided?

_Tho_. There is a note of the particulars.

_Un_. Tis very well done, _Thomas_.--Let me see: Imprimis--

_Tho_. The Captaine wonot faile to be w'ee, sir. He was not at his
lodging; and inquiring at the _Horne_ tavern, I heard he had been there
with two or three Cittizens that ow'd him mony.

_Un_. That he owde mony to.

_Tho_. Tis all one, I thinke, Sir; for when Captaines have not pay, the
creditors may pay themselves. Here they said he did mollifie the hart of
the haberdashers and dranke himselfe a little mellowe ere they parted,
which gave me some hope I might find him ere night at the _Divell_,
where indeed I fetcht him out of the fire and gave him your Letter.

_Un_. And the gold too?

_Tho_. That was the first word he read; if you did not write it in text
he could not have found it out so soone. His eye was no sooner in the
inside but his arme flew out with an open mouth and his very fingers
cryed "give me the gold"! which presumeing to be weight he put in his
hocas pocas, a little dormer under his right skirt; and so takeing his
word to come downe and turning over your horse to him, with caution not
to be drunk and forgett your worship, I tooke my leave and went about
my Inventorie.

_Un_. Theis things are very right, _Thomas_. Let me see now the bookes
of Martiall discipline.

_Tho_. I bought up all that I found have relation to warr and fighting.

_Un_. That was weldone.--Item: _The Sword Salve_.

_Tho_. This I conceiv'd to have the vertue of _Achilles_ speare: if you
bee hurt you need goe no further then the blade for a Surgeon.

_Un_. The _Buckler of Faith_.

_Tho_. You had the sword before, Sir.

_Un_. A _Booke of Mortification_.

_Tho_. I, Sir, that is a kind of killing which I thought very necessary
for a Captaine.

_Un_. Item: the _Gunpowder Treason_ and the _Booke of Cannons_.

_Tho_. I wod not lett any shott scape mee.

_Un_. _Shakespeares_ Workes.--Why _Shakespeares_ Workes?

_Tho_. I had nothing for the pikemen before.

_Un_. They are plays.

_Tho_. Are not all your musterings in the Countrey so, Sir? Pray,
read on.

_Un_. _Bellarmines Controversie_ in six tomes.

_Tho_. That I took upon the Stationers word, who had been a pretty
Schollar at Paules; for the word _Bellarmine_, he said, did comprehend
warr, weapons and words of defiance. Ill words provoke men to draw their
sword, and fighting makes an end of the busines; and all this is
controversy. Pray, goe on, Sir.

_Un_. Two paire of Tables.--Tables for what?

_Tho_. Oh, sir, for ticktack. You know it was in my note, which though I
doubted at first, yet considering you were newly made a Cap: I conceiv'd
it was fitt you should learne to sett and or[d]er your men.

_Un_. Tacticks, man: thou didst mistake, they are bookes of warre.

_Tho_. You cannot know these from bookes as they are painted,
I warrant you.

_Un_. Why, dost thou thinke theis will make a Souldier?

_Tho_. Not of themselves, Sir, and therefore I provided: please you
read on, Sir.

_Un_. _Parsons Resolutions_ and _Felthams Resolves_[241].

_Tho_. All is nothing I knew, Sir, without resolution.

_Un_. Summa totalis three and twenty poundes nyneteene shillings and
sevenpence.--Thou hast undone mee.

_Tho_. If you doe not like the pennyworths tis but the charges of my
selfe and a horse agen to _London_. I will lose but the three odd pounds
19s and 7d: it may be you doe not understand these Authors: when the
Captaine comes he will expound 'em to you.

_Un_. What a Coxcombe have I to my man! but I dare not be angry with
him. Well, carry 'em into my study, _Thomas_.

                                  [_Ext. Tho_.

    _Enter Device_.

_De_. Most honor'd Captaine.

_Un_. My compleat Monsier _Device_, this is a grace to us. You come to
visit your Mistres my Cosen. As if by instinct she had knowledge of your
    [_Enter Ladie and Sister, & Dorothy_.
approach, she is come to meet you.--Shall I never get opportunitie with
that shee waiter! If I gett her with Child my man _Thomas_ shall marry
her.

    _Enter Thomas_.

_Tho_. Sir, the Captaine is new alighted.

_Un_. Gett a bottle of sack up to my Chamber presently.

                            [_Ext. [Underwit & Thomas_.

_La_. You are a gentleman of your word.

_Sis_. And such a gentleman is to be trusted, Madam.

_De_. He is an Infidell that will breake his word with a Ladie.

_Sis_. I suspect, servant, you have many Mistresses.

_De_. Not I, by this white hand. I must acknowledge there are some
Ladies in the Court in whose eyes and opinion I am favour'd. I cannot
obscure my selfe from their observation; but my heart with contempt of
all other endeerement is only devoted to your service.

_Sis_. Is't not a charge to dresse your selfe with such variety of
Ribbands every day?

_De_. Is that your scruple? Tis the Mode to express our fancie upon
every occasion; to shew the turne and present state of our hope or
feares in our Affection. Your colours to an understanding Lover carry
the interpretation of the hart as plainely as wee express our meaning
one to another in Characters. Shall I decipher my Colours to you now?
Here is Azure and Peach: Azure is constant, and Peach is love; which
signifies my constant Affection.

_Sis_. This is very pretty.

_De_. Oh, it saves the trouble of writing, where the Mistres and Servant
are learned in this amorous blazon. Yesterday I wore Folimort, Grisdelin
and Isabella: Folimort is withered, Grisdelin is absent, and Isabella is
beauty, which put together express I did wither or languish for your
absent beautie.

_Sis_. But is there any reason for theis distinctions?

_De_. Yes, Lady: for example, your Follimort is a withred leafe, which
doth moralise a decay: your yellow is joy, because--

_La_. Why, yellow, Sir, is Jealous.

_De_. No, your Lemon colour, a pale kind of yellow, is Jealous; your
yellow is perfect joy. Your white is Death, your milke white inocence,
your black mourning, your orange spitefull, your flesh colour
lascivious, your maides blush envied, your red is defiance, your gold is
avaritious, your straw plenty, your greene hope, your sea greene
inconstant, your violet religious, your willow forsaken.

_Sis_. We may then comitt a solecisme and be strangely interpreted by
such curious expounders in the rash election and wearing of our colours,
I p[er]ceave.

_La_. Tis pitty but there should be some bookes for our instruction in
this art.

_De_. Your Hierogliphick was the _Egiptian_ wisdome, your _Hebrew_ was
the Cabala, your _Roman_ had your Simball or impresse; but they are now
obsolete, your embleme trite and conspicuous, your invention of
Character and Alphabeticall key tedious and not delightfull, your motto
or rebus too open and demonstrative: but the science and curiosity of
your Colours in Ribbands is not only instructive but an ornament and the
nearest Comentator of Love; for as Love is entertain'd first by the eye,
or, to speake more plaine, as the object affected is tooke in first by
these opticks which receive the species of the thing colord &
beautifide, so it is answerable to nature that in the progresse of our
passion we should distinguish by our eye the change or constancy of our
affections in apt and significant colours.

_Sis. _You have tooke paines to study this learn'd heraldry.

_De_. It is the onely gentile knowledge or philosophie in the world. I
will undertake to open any man or womans hart.

_La_. Heaven forbid!

_De_. Tell the most secret imaginations and designes conclude every
passion and scruple, if they be carefull to observe the artificiall
method of their colours.

_Sis_. Why, this may be a way of fortune telling too.

_De_. You say right, Lady: phisiognomy and chiromancy are but trifles;
nay, your geomancie meere coniecturall, the execution of your schemes
circumstantiall and fallible, but your quaint alamode weare of your
fancie more then astrologicall.

_La_. Tis a kind of Divinitie.

_De_. You say very true, Madam, and comes neere to propheticall if the
minds of Ladies and gentlemen were elevated to the just and sublime
consideration.

_Sis_. What paines he takes to be ridiculous!

_Do_. This gentleman has a notable fancie and talkes poetically.

_Sis_. Yes, yes; he can write verses.

_Do_. Well, I have read Authors in my dayes and knew the length of the
poets in my tyme too, which was an hexameter and which a pentameter, but
the wits are not as they have been--right and straite.

_Sis_. Why, _Doroty_?

_Do_. Why, because wind is the cause of many things; now if the wind bee
not in the right corner tis the ill wind our proverbe speakes of that
blowes nobodie good; for when vapors and wind flie into the head it
cannot be in two places at one time: and that's the reason your men of
most wit doe seldome love a woman.--But here comes my Master and Sir
_Francis_.

    _Enter Sir Richard and Sir Francis, and Mr. Courtwell_.

_Ri_. This is a double honour to us, _Sir Francis_. I shall want
language, but not a friendly hart to entertaine you and your noble
kinsman. What my exquisite Cavalier _Device_!--tis to no purpose I see
to remove into the Countrey to save charges and be quiet; the whole
Citty will come hither if I stay. I have no stomack to my kn't.

_Fra_. I hope, madam, you will be no enemy to my kinsman.

_Ri_. Sister, I present this gentleman; observe and cherish him; he has
been i'th Universitie.

_Sis_. Any degree, Sir?

_Co_. Onely Bachelour, forsooth!

_Ri_. If he winne you to marriage, Lady quicksilver--

_Sis_. He wilbe Master of his Art.

_Ri_. My vote is for him.

_De_.--I like not the induction of this rivall.

_Ri_. He studies now the law,
And thats the high way to preferment, Sister.

_Sis_. Indeed it is the high way in which some
Deliver up their purses. He may clime
To scarlet, but that he has too good a face.

_De_. Sir, I hope--

_Ri_. Troth, do not, Sir,--I meane, trouble yourselfe:
He is too bashfull to prevaile upon
Your spirited mistres!

    _Enter Mr. Engine_.

_En_. Sir _Richard_.

_Ri_. More customers? Mr. _Engine_, welcome;
Your presence was unexpected in the Countrey.

_En_. Twas my ambition with some intents
To serve you, sir. Please you vouchsafe your privacie,
I bring Affaires are worth your entertainement:
I have rid hard.

_Cou_. What Cavallier's this, Uncle?

_Fra_. He is the inventor of new proiects, cosen,
They say, and patents; one that lives like a moth
Upon the Common wealth.

_Cou_. He lookes like one.

_Ric_. You will excuse me, gentlemen.--Make much of Sir _Francis_, Madam.

                                          _Ext. [Sir Richard and Engine_.

_Fra_. Weele leave my Nephew and your sister, Madam,
And take a turne i'th garden.

_Sis_. You may be confident.

           [_Exeunt Sir Francis, Lady, and Dorothy_.

_De_.--I doe not like the fancie in his hat;
That gules is warre and will be ominous.

                              _Ext. [Device_.

_Sis_. The gentleman's turnd statue! blesse me how
He staires upon me and takes roote, I thinke.
It mooves, and now to earth is fixt agen;
Oh, now it walkes and sadly marches this way.
Is't not a ghost? heele fright me. Oh, sweet sir,
Speake if you can and say who murderd you.
It points at me: my eyes? ungentle eyes
To kill so at first sight! Ile have my lookes
Arraigned for't and small _Cupid_ shall be judg,
Who for your sake will make me blind as he is.

_Co_. Ladie--

_Sis_. The man's alive agen and has
A tongue! discretion guide it; he but sent
His soule forth of an arrand; tis returnd,
Now wee shall have some sentences.

_Co_. Such are the strange varieties in love,
Such heates, such desperate coldes,--

_Sis_. No more winter, and you love me, unlesse you can command the
colepits; we have had a hard tyme on't already for want of fuell.

_Co_. I'me all turnd eares and, Lady, long to heare you,
But pressing to you doubt I am too neare you.
Then I would speake, but cannot; nought affordes
Expression, th'Alphabet's too poore for wordes:
He that knowes Love knowes well that every hower
Love's glad, Love's sad, Love's sweet--

_Sis_. And sometymes sower. Theis wordes would goe well to a tune; pray
letts heare you sing. I doe not thinke but you can make me a ioynture of
fower nobles a yeare in Balletts, in lamentable balletts; for your wit I
thinke lies tragicall. Did you make the _Ladies Downefall_[242].
You expresse a passion rarely, but pray leave
Your couplets and say something in blanck verse
Before you goe.

_Co_. Before I goe? breath not that killing language:
There is no sunne but in your eyes, and when
I once take leave of those celestiall beames
I meet with darkenes in my habitation;
Where stretch'd on sable ground I downe shall lay
My mournefull body, and with folded Armes
Heare sadder noats uppon the _Irish_ harpe[243]
And drop division with my brinish teares.[244]

_Sis_. This must be lamentable musick sure!

_Co_. But I have found an art to cure this wound,
For I with fancies pencill will so draw
Your picture in the table of my hart,
Your absence shall but like darke shadowes stand
To sett you of and see you, Lady, better
Then Love will lett me when I looke upon you.

_Sis_. Could this be true and meant, sweet sir, to me,
I should be kinder then the gentlest spring
That warms the world and makes fierce beasts so tame
And trees to swell themselves to cheerefull greene;
More jocund then the proudest quire of birds,
What ere they be that in the woods so wide
Doe sing their merry catches.--Sure he does
But counterfeit.

_Co_. Oh, now I see that Love
Is sweet as flowers in their fragrant birth,
Gentle as silke, and kind as Cloudes to Earth?

_Sis_. One rime more and you undoe my love for ever. Out upon't! pedlars
_French_[245] is a Christian language to this. I had rather you should
put me a case out of _Litleton_. They say you are a pretty Lawyer.

_Co_. Tenant[246] per la Curtesie d'Engleterre est, hon home prent feme
seisie in fee simple ou en fee taile generall, ou seisie come
heire de la taile speciall et ad issue per mesme la fame, male ou
female, oies ou wife, soit lissue apres mort ou en vie si la feme de
aie, la baron tiendra la terre durant sa vie, per la ley dengleterre.

_Sis_. Nay, here's enough a Conscience! What a Noise this confusion of
languages make; tis almost as good as a beare baiting. Harke you, Sir,
you are never like to recover me by law.

_Co_. You are not the first sweet Ladie has been overthrowne at
Common Lawe.

_Sis_. Not by tenn thousand, Sir. Confest: but I have no mind to come to
issue with a Lawyer; when he should consider my cause at home, heele be
at _Westminster_, teaching men the Statutes. No, no, I wo'not marry a
Judge.

_Co_. Why, Lady?

_Sis_. They are casuall things and men that hold such strange opinions.

_Co_. Lady, you may be misinform'd: _Astraea_
Hath not quite left the earth, and the abuses
Of some which shame the calling are but like
Patches of beauty on the shape of lawe
To set the whitenes of.

_Sis_. Farewell, Sir:
You are in love with a barrd gown, not beauty;
If you will be my learned Counsell, leave it
--This yong thing is a foole or a fine fellow.    [_Exit_.

_Co_. She kicks and flings out like a Colt unwayed;
Her witt's a better portion then her money;
I would not love her yet, and I could help it.--
My Uncle and his Mistres: Ile not hinder em.

                                             [_Ex_.


[SCENE 3.]


    _Enter Sir Francis and Ladie_.

_La_. It is no honour, Sir, if arm'd with so
Much eloquence you overcome a woman.
I blush to say I love you now too much;
I wish you would release what your sweet charmes
Won from my tongue; I shall repent my promise.

_Fra_. Make me not miserable after so much blessing.
Why, Madam, tis on honourable tearmes,
Since not upon the first attempt but after
A tedious seige in to your faire love you give up
What shall enrich us both. It were a sinne
To feare you can retract what both our lipps
Have seal'd, and loose a happines so neare
And so secure. Your husband holds his pleasure
Of early hunting constant, and when he
Pursues the tymerous hare to morrow morne,
_Cupid_ will waite to bring me to _Elizium_,
Your bed, where every kisse shall new create us.

_La_. You must be wise in your excuse, to quit
His importunitie.

_Fra_. Leave that to me:
I weare not worth the name of him that serv'd you
To loose my glorious hope for want of such
A thinne device. In your thought wish me prosper,
And I am fortifide against the power
Of fate to seperate us; and when thou art
Within the amorous circle of my armes,
We will make lawes to love; teach him new motion
Or chaine[247] him with the cordage of his haire,
Like a tame thing, to walke, and watch our pillow
And be our pleasures Centinell.

_La_. I see
My husband; tis not safe he should observe us:
Be wise and constant.    [_Exit Lady_.

_Fra_. All that's sweet attend thee.
So I am sailing now to my owne _Indies_,
And see the happie Coast, too: How my wings
Doe spread to catch the wind which comes to court 'em,
And the green Sea, enamour'd on my barke,
Doth leap to see how _Cupid_ sitts at helme.
And steeres my soule to his new world.

    _Enter Sir Richard and Engine_.

_Ri_. A monopolie say you
For Perriwigs?

_En_. Is't not a rare designe? and by such art
And reasons I can name, most beneficiall
To the common wealth, preventing the diseases
Which some unwholsome haire breeds in mens heads,
It will be worth our agitation, Sir;
And you, after the rate of every thousand
Per Annum milk'd out of the comon purse
Into your owne, may easily defaulke
To me a hundred for my first projection.
Did I not love you, Sir, I could make choice
Of other able men that would be glad
To multiplie their money.

_Ri_. Sir, I thanke you,
But have no mind to thrive upon abuse of
My princes favour nor the peoples curse.
Here is a gentleman, Sir _Francis Courtwell_,
Perhapps will undertake it.

_Fra_. What, Sir _Richard_?

_Ri_. A Monopolie for composeing and selling of perriwiggs.

_Fra_. Excuse me, Sir, I dare not deale in 'em.
If I be not mistaken, Sir, your name
Is _Engine_?

_En_. Yes, Sir.

_Fra_. The proiector generall?
If I may advise you, Sir, you should make your will,
Take some convenient phisick and dye tymely
To save your credit, and an execution:
It is thought else--

_En_. Oh--

_Fra_. What aile you, Sir?

_En_. A Megrim in my head.

_Ri_. Whoes there?

    _Enter Thomas_.

Looke to Mr. _Engine_ heere, he faints, and send
To your Ladie for some Cordiall waters presently.

_Tho_. There is a Soveraigne Well hard by has done
Strange cures: please you, ile throw him into that.
               _Ext. [Thomas; carrying away Engine_.

_Ri_. Though I distast his busines I wod not
He should miscarry here; you frighted him.
But come, I thinke tis supper tyme, Sir _Francis_.
I shall expect youle hunt with me i'th morning;
I have a pack of Doggs sent me will make
The Forrest ring.

_Fra_. Ile cheerefully attend you,
I love the sport; as earlie as you please, Sir.

_Ri_. I wish wee had all pleasures to delight you,
But no thing wants in my true love to serve you.

_Fra_.--Yet I must cuckold him; I cannot helpe it.


_Act the Third_.


    _Enter Thomas with Sir Richards bootes_.

_Tho_. Sir.

_Within Ri_. Whoes that? _Thomas_?

_Tho_. The sun is up before you. Here be your bootes.

_Ri_. That's well.

_Within La_. I preethe donot rise yet; it is hardly day. Sirra, who bid
you call him so earlie? Sir _Richard_ wonot rise yet.

_Tho_. I cannot helpe it, it is none of my fault.

_La_. Wheres _Doroty_?

    [_Enter Doroty_.

_Do_. Here, Madam; what make you up so soone, _Thomas_?

_Tho_. O Mistres _Dority_, tis e'ne long of you, for betweene sleepe
and awake your remembrance came to me this morning, and _Thomas_ was
up presently.

    _Enter Sir Richard [& Lady]_.

_Ri_. You must excuse me, wife;
I meane to kill a brace of hares before
You thinke tis day. Come, on with my Bootes, _Thomas_;
And _Dorothy_ goe you to Sir _Francis_ Chamber,
Tell him the Day growes old and I am readie,
Our horses and the merry hounds expect us.

_La_. Any excuse to leave me.

_Ri_. You may take
Your ease a bed still, Madam. Ile not loose
One morning that invites so pleasantly,
To heare my Doggs, for a new Maidenhead, I.
Twas for these sports and my excess of charge
I left the towne: besides the Citty foggs
And steame of Brick hills almost stifled me;
This Aire is pure and all my owne.

_Tho_. My Ladie
Meanes shee would have you gett another heire,
Sir, for your lands; though it be against my Master
The young Captaine, yet she speakes but reason.
And now I talke o'th Captaine, Sir,
Would you had given him Counsell.

_Ri_. To what?

_Tho_. Before he tooke this huffing[248] trade upon him,
To have been a man of peace, I meane a Justice.
Nature has made him fit for both alike.
Hee's now at charge to keepe a Captaine Schoolemaster;
He might have sav'd the qua[r]teridge of his Tutor
If I had been his Clarke: and then the income
That broken heads bring in, and new yeares guifts
From soder'd virgins and their shee provintialls
Whose warren must be licenc'd from our office!

_Ri_. Away you prating knave.--

    [_Enter Dorothy_.

What? is he readie?

_Do_. Alas, hee's almost dead.

_Ri_. How? dead?

_Do_. He has been troubled with a fitt o'th stone,
Sir, all this night. Sweet gentleman he groanes,
And sweates, and cannot--

_Ri_. What?

_Do_. Make urine, Sir.

_Tho_. I heard my Ladie has an excellent
Receit to cure the Stone; she is a peece
Of a rare Surgeon.

_Ri_. Well, away and get the horses readie, sirra,
For I shall ride you and your witt together.

_Tho_. Alas, any foole may ride me, but I would
faine see any man ride Mistres _Dorothy_.

_Do_. How, sirra?
                                 [_Exit Thomas_.

_Ri_. I am sorry I must leave such a Companion.
But more lament the cause. I wish him health;
My presence cannot serve him. Morrow, wife:
I cannot lose my sport.    [_Exit_.

_Do_. Nor shee when you are gone.
My Lady does expect another hunt's up.

_La_. Now I must trust thy secresie.

_Do_. You shall not doubt me, Madam, and t'assure you
My faith, I have a suit to your Ladiship
Whose grant, were there no other bonds upon me,
Would tye me everlastinglie to silence.

_La_. What ist? but name, and I shall soone confirme thee.

_Do_. Our Captaine o'th traind band has been offring
To chaffer Maidenheads with me. I must
Confesse I can affect the foole upon
Good tearmes, and could devise a plott to noose
My amorous woodcock, if you privatlie
Assist me and dare trust me with some Jewell
Of price, that is not knowne, which shalbe faithfully
Restor'd Madam.

_La_. I that dare trust my honour with thee sha'not
Suspect thy faith in any treasure else.
But prethe draw the Curtains close, while I
Expect this friend: I needes must hide my blushes.
Thou maist discover from the Gallory windowe
When they are hors'd. I tremble to consider
What I have promis'd.

_Do_. Tremble to meet a Ghost!
You are more fearefull then a Virgin, Madam.
Why this setts me a longing; but ile watch:
This is the timerous world of flesh and blood.
                                       [_Exit_.

    _Enter Sir Richard_.

_La. within_. Alas!
What doe you meane? retire for heavens sake!
My husband is not gone, I heare his voice yet;
This rashnes will undoe my fame for ever
Should he returne.

_Ri_. How's this?
"Returne for heavens sake! my husband is not gone:
I heard his voice; this will undoe my fame!"
It was my wife, and this is sure my bed chamber.

_La_. (_looking forth_.) I have undone my selfe; it is my husband.

_Ri_. My forehead sweats: Where are you, Madam?
Whome did you talke too or take me for? ha! Asleepe
Alreadie, or doe I dreame? I am all wonder.
Madam,--

_La_. You may kill him and please you, sweet heart;
I cannot abide a Blackamore.

_Ri_. How's this, wife?

_La_. Helpe, helpe, deare husband, strangle him with one
Of my Lute strings; doe, doe, doe.

_Ri_. If shee be a sleepe she was not us'd to talke thus:
She has some hideous dreame. She spake to me, to;
Whom should I strangle, sweet hart, with a lute string?

_La_. The King of _Morocco_, I thinke.

_Ri_. Tis so, she dreames. What strange Chimeras wee
Doe fancie in our sleepe! I were best wake her.
Madam, Madam!

_La_. O Murder, Murder!

_Ri_. Sweet heart, Madam, wake!

_La_. Whoes that?

_Ri_. Tis I.

_La_. Sir _Richard_? Oh you have delivered me
From such a dreame I quake to thinke upon't.

_Ri_. I must confesse you frighted me at first.

    _Enter Dorothy_.

_Do_.--My Master come back? if he had found the [sic] Sir _Francis_ here!

_Ri_. How now? art thou frighted too?

_Do_. Frighted, quoth a! Oh, Madam, the key of the Closet quickly. I
must have some Cordiall water for Sir _Francis_; I feare this fitt will
kill him.

_La_. Alas, good gentleman! make hast.

_Do_.--His appearance would betray all: I thus prevent it.

_La_. Nay, sweet hart, you sha'not leave me till I ha told
What a cruell Dreame I had. Methought a king
Of Blackamores was in love with me, and haveing
By flattering Courtship drawne me to his bed chamber,
With my consent or force swore to enjoy mee.
I knew not by what reasons to divert
The Ravisher, but told him that I heard
Thy voice, and bid him if he lov'd his life
Retire, for thou wouldst deere revenge my honour.
But he pursueing me, I cry'd out Murder!
At which sad noise methought I saw thee enter,
But, having nere a sword, I counselld thee
To strangle him with a Lute string, for which cruelty
Of mine, me thought he threw an Arrow at me,
Which, if thou hadst not wak'd me as thou didst,
Would as I slept with my strong feares ha killd me.

_Ri_. This was the King of _Morocco_: well, I'me glad
I came to take away thy fright.

_La_. But, sweet, you left me with a resolution
To hunt this morning. Have you done already?

_Ri_. The theeves prevented me.
My Stable has been rob'd to night; two geldings
And my roane Nagg are vanished.

_La_. How?

_Ri_. Nay, doe not thou vexe:
I have sent hue and cry that may oretake 'em.
But come, Ile leave thee to my glasse,
And visit Sir _Francis_ now shees return'd.--

    [_Enter Dorothy_.

How does our Noble guest?

_Do_. Hees pretty well: he has voided one stone since
And now finds ease.

_Ri_. Tis well: attend your Mistres.    [_Exit_.

_La_. O, wench, I had almost undone my selfe,
Come o'tother side, reach me that peticote;
Ile tell the storie as I make me ready.

                                  _Ex[eun]t_.


[SCENE 2.]


    _Enter Device, Sister_.

_Sis_. Ist possible you can talke thus and be no travailer?

_De_. I have traveld in my fancie, Ladie, and with the Muses, and do for
my recreation of witt compose some wonders in verse, poeticall essaies,
as once upon the report of a heate that was in _Egipt_.

_Sis_. Lets heare 'em.

_De_. _In Countreys I have been
Under the Equinoctiall, where I have seene
The Sunne disperse such a prodigious heat
That made our sive-like skins to raine with sweat.
Men would have given for an Ecclipse their lives,
Or one whisper of Aire; yet each man strives
To throw up grasse, feathers, nay women, too,
To find the wind: all falls like lead, none blew.
The Dogstarre spits new fire till't came to passe
Each eye became his neighbours burning glasse.
Leane men did burne to ashes presentlie,
Fatt men did wast to leane Anatomye;
Young womens heat did gett themselves with child,
For none but they themselves themselves defild;
Old women naturally to witches turne,
And onely rubbing one another burne.
The beasts were bak'd, skin turnd to crust, they say,
And fishes in the River boild away.
Birds in the aire were rosted and not burn'd,
For, as they fell downe, all the way they turn'd_.

_Sis_. Most excellent!

_De_. I have seene Larkes in that motion at fire
With an Engine of packthread perpendicular.

_Sis_. What would they have given for a shower in those Cuntries?

_De_. Now you talke of a Shower you shall heare
Another coppie of Verses that I made
Of a mighty raine which fell once in the _Indies_.

_Sis_. That you made? If you will venture your lungs let me heare more
impossible stories to passe away the tyme.

_De. _Heaven did not weepe, but in its swelling eye
Whole Seas of Rhume and moist Catarrs did lie,
Which so bespauld the lower world, men see
Corne blasted and the fruit of every tree;
Aire was condenst to water gainst their wish,
And all their foule was turn'd to flying Fish;
Like watermen they throng'd to ply a fare,
As though it had been navigable Aire.
Beasts lost the naturall motion of each limbe,
Forgott to goe with practiseing to swime:
A trout now here you would not thinke how soone
Taken and drest for th'Emperour o'the Moone,
The fixed Starres, though to our eyes were missing
Wee knew yet were by their continuall hissing.
Weomen were mermaides sailing with the wind,
The greatest miracle was fish behind:
But men were all kept chast against their wish,
And could comitt but the cold sin of fish_.

_Sis_. And that synne would puzzle all the Civell Lawyers in the
kingdome. Sinns of the flesh they are perfect in; they know well enough
what belongs to Adultery and simple fornication, but you would much
improve and oblige the practise of the Court, if you could bring this
sinne of fish under the Commission. But now, I hope, the raine is over
we shall have faire weather.

_De_. Now I can tell you, Lady, what a strange frost was in one part of
the world--

_Sis_. I shall cry out fire if you doe; I had rather have some discourse
to keepe me warm still.

_De_. Or how the whole world was troubled with the wind Collick.

_Sis_. No more Earthquakes, I beseech you. Some frends of myne lost a
great deale of land the last terme, and for ought I know tis never like
to be recover'd. Why, all these verses you have honourd me to heare were
translated out of _French_.

_De_. You say very right, Lady.

_Sis_. No, no; they are out of _Spanish_, as I remember.

_De_. I thinke it be out of _Spanish_, indeed.

_Sis_. Or else the _Italian_.

_De_. Troth, I know not which very well.

_Sis_. And yet you made 'em! Some gentlemen have the faculty to make
verses and forgett what language was the Originall: tis Alamode, I
confesse, sir.

_De_. Thers the mischiefe in poetry: a man might have told 200 lies in
prose upon his owne name, and never miscaried.--But, leaving these rude
rymes, Ladie, how do you like the novice that Sir _Richard_ comended.

_Sis_. Mr. _Courtwell_?

_De_. Is he not a pretty Chrisome[249]? I could not choose but laugh to
observe in what rurall deportment he came to salute you, that should
have made his address in theis postures.

_Sis_. Tis enough, sir; I apprehend what you would doe. The truth is,
touching that thing in black, I doe not love him.

_De_. I know't; tis impossible.

_Sis_. Why is't impossible? The man's a pretty indifferent meaning man,
but I must have one of a more active spiritt. No, no, the man's a
Coward.

_De_. He lookes like one.

_Sis_. I put him to't, he dares not fight; and he that expects my favour
to so high a degree as marriage must be none of my lord Maiors
whifflers[250]; he must be valiant in Armes. I am not taken with a ring
or Caskanet, as some avaritious Ladies; he that presents me with the
sword of his rivall is more welcome then all the silken soft natur'd six
hundreds a yeere, that will be baffeld in their best clothes and goe
downe into the Country every Vacacon like Atturneys to be beaten against
next terme and get damage by it, but I forget some affaires that
concerne me. I take my leave. Your deserts upon me are eminent and many,
and for all your noble services I--will promise you nothing: you
apprehend me?

_De_. O, sweet Lady, tis too much.

_Sis_. I am so weary I can stay no longer w'ee.    [_Exit_.

_De_. You make mee over happie.--So, so; the matters done. I may write
my friends. Hum: well thought upon! I shall leave her joyes without any
bound to entertaine me if I first beat this foolish rivall of mine and
present her with his sword. She assures me he dares not fight: it shall
be so. Thus with one baffling and disarming him I shall secure my
Mistresse and get the reputation of a fighting Cavallier, which may save
me many a knock hereafter among men of strong faith that shall heare how
much honour I have elsewhere taken upon the ticket.


[SCENE 3.]


    _Enter Captaine and Underwit_.

_Un_. Stand right to your files, make even your rankes, silence!
Front to the right hand.
As you were.
To the right hand about.
By the left hand.
As you were.
Rankes to the right double.
Rankes as you were.
Rankes to the left double.
Midlemen to the right hand double the front; as you were,--to the left,
--double the front; middle-men to the right entire [or[251] by division]
double the front; files to the right,--to the left,--to the right hand
countermarch,--to the right,--to the left,--wheele about--

_Cap_. Ran tan: enough,--you must not wast your lunges
Too much at once. March faire and make a Captaine.
When these words of Command are rotten (rooted?) wee
Will sowe some other military seeds.
You beare[252] a braine and memory.

_Un_. I hope so.

[_Cap_.[253]] And now you are chose a Captaine for your Countrey
You must give good example to your Soldiers
And cherish nature after exercise:
You must drinke sack, sack is a fortifier.
Come, wee'le to the taverne.

_Un_. With all my heart.

    [_Enter Mr. Courtwell_.

Here's Mr. _Courtwell_: lett's take him with us.

_Cap_. My costive Countrey man? hee's an Anabaptist: he wonot drinke,
and yet kist the Cupp of last night, me thought, when his Mistres--
drank to him: wee'le try. How ist, my man of mortall breeding?

_Cou_. My man of warre, trebonn.--Your servant, Captaine.

_Cap_. Why, this was spoke like one of us; canst doo't
Agen? thy voice is more authentick, soundes
As I have heard a Cavalliers in taverne,
Or like the merry master of the _Dragon_,
Small _Neptune_, that controlls the rich Canaries,
When he Comaunds the Tritons of his cellar
'Skud, and bring wine, you varlotts, with a flavour
For my Nobilitie.' Wee were conspiring
To goe to'th taverne.

_Cou_. Ile make one, gentlemen, to wash away some melancholy.

_Cap_. Spoke boldlie, like an _Argonaute_.

_Cou_. I am not now in _London_,
Upon a hall day marching with the puisnes,
Twenty on's in a teame, to _Westminster_
In our torne gownes, embroiderd with _Strand_ dirt,
To heare the Law.

_Cap_. Is not thy father dead, thou talkst so well?
How I was cosend in thee: come away.

    _Enter Thomas_.

_Un_. Here's my man _Thomas_.

_Cap_. Now the Newes, Sir _Tristram_.

_Tho_. Oh the Gentleman is mad.

_Un_. What gentleman?

_Tho_. Why, Mr. Engine that did faint last night.

_Un_. With feare of being hang'd for his projections.

_Cou_. My Uncle told me of him.

_Cap. Let him to _Bedlam_ then; what makes he here?
Clean straw and a good whip are held restoratives.

_Tho_. He walkes and talkes the madliest; twenty midwives
Are nothing to him, he drownes all their noise.
His tongue is twenty ring of Bells, and yett
He seemes so merry.

    _Enter Engine_.

_En_. Save you, gentlemen, gallants, Cavalliers. How farre travell you:
me thinkes you are very finely accomodated. Are you a Doctor, sir?

_Cap_. No, but I can tell you how to purge, and please you.

_En_. You say very well. Troth, gentlemen you must pardon me: cry you
mercy, your name is Captaine _Underwit_.

_Un_. Yes, sir, but my mother came of the _Over-muches_ by the _Peake_.
She broke my father's hart, and Sir _Richard_ buried her: things must be
as please the starres.

_En_. What thinke you of the blazeing starre in _Germany_? according to
_Ptolmy_ tis very strange. Does the race hold at _Newmarket_ for the
Cup[254]? When is the Cocking, gentlemen? There are a parcell of rare
Jewells to be sold now, and a man had money. I doe meane to build a very
fine house next summer and fish ponds. What did you heare of the new
play. I am afraid the witts are broke; there be men will make affidavit
that [they] have not heard a good jest since _Tarleton_[255] dyed. Pray,
may I crave your name, sir?

_Cou_. My name is _Courtwell_, sir.

_En_. In your eare; I have a cast of the best Marlins[256] in England,
but I am resolv'd to goe no more by water but in my Coach. Did you ever
see the great ship?[257]

_Cap_. I have been one of twenty that have dind in her lanterne.

_En_. It may be so; she is a good sailer. But ile tell you one thing: I
intend to have the best pack of hounds in _Europe_; Sir Richard loves
the sport well. And then if I can but find out the reason of the
loadstone I were happie and would write _Non Ultra_.

_Cap_. The philosophers stone were better in my opinion. Have you no
project to gett that?

_Cou_. That has startled him: I doubt this fellow does but counterfeit.

_Un_. What thinke you of the Dromedary that was to be seene at the back
side[258] of the _Bell_.

_En_. I have seene a stranger beast.

_Cap_. So have I; I have seene you before now, sir.

_En_. Why then, ile tell you: the strangest beast that ever I saw was an
Ostridge that eate up the Iron mynes. But now you talke of birds I saw
an Elephant beat a Taylor in the fenceing schoole at his owne weapon.

_Tho_. The _Spanish_ needle?

_En_. He did out eat him in bread, and that was miraculous. I have seene
a Catamountaine[259] once; but all was nothing to the wench that turnd
round and thred needles.

_Cou_. Troth, sir, I thinke you have turnd round, too, and are not
setled yet.

_En_. Now you talke of setling I knew a gentleman, that was borne to a
good fortune, sold all his land, went to sea in a _Hollander_, was taken
by the _Dunkirke_; at seaven yeares end stole away in an _English_
botome; after that saw both the _Indies_; for all this was taken by a
_Turks_ man of warre, put into the Gallies, and for ought I heare by
credible report is not setled yet.

_Tho_. Sure he is a great scholler; a man cannot understand him.

_Un_. His braines are out of tune.

_En_. Now you talke of Musick theres no man in the world loves musick
better then I,--ile give you the reason: I have been deafe almost this
halfe yeare, and it came with a cold sitting up a primero.

_Co_. Now you talke of the cold it puts me in mind of the new device of
fire for brewing and bakeing. Had you no hand in the project?

_Cap_. Againe hees startled: come, he shall to taverne with us and
confess all. If he do not strip his soule stark naked to us, say I am no
fortune teller.--Please you to honour our society: we are going to
indulge at the taverne hard by.

_En_. You shall comand me, sir. Oh the Neats tongues and partargoes that
I have eaten at Stillyard, but of all things in the world I do not love
a black catt: next a brewers cart, there's nothing will stay a man so
much in the night as a Constables. One word before you go, and I beseech
you give me your opinion cleerely: was not the _Morocco_ Ambasadour a
very fine gentleman for a pagan?

_Cap_. Yes, surely, and the lead mines in _Darbishire_ hold still for
the Allom businesses. But come; will you walke, Sir?

_En_. I do use to goe a foote sometymes but when I ride; and then I must
confesse there is no striving with the streame. You were in _London_
lately: they say the people are more affected to beare baiting then in
former tyme.

_Cap_. There are some a late are drawne like beares to the stake; but
for your owne part the gout and the grand pox are all one to you. What
price beare[s] meat in the shambles?

_En_. Flesh rises and falls as it us'd to doe, sir; but a Countrey life
is the best when all's done. What thinke you of a bridg from _Lion_ key
to _Flaunders_? You may guess I talke at randum, gentlemen; but you must
not interpret all foolish discourse a distemper of the braine: Lords
would take it for a _Scandalum Magnatum_ and your Ladies would bee angry
too.

    _Enter Sir Francis and Lady_.

Now you talke of Ladies--

_Cap_. By no meanes, Mr. _Engin_; that gentleman loves you not. Come,
ile bring up the rere. Where's _Thomas_?

                 [_Exeunt Underwit, Captain, Courtwell and Engine_.

_Tho_. Ile follow, sir.--I would give my fower marks a yeare that I
could talke like that mad gentleman. Hee's here and there and
everywhere. How will his tongue run when his Coggs are oild; theile
drench him!    [_Exit_.

_Fra_. Although I mist a happines, I applaud
Your nimble wit that securd both our honours.
You have an excellent Instrument too o' your gentlewoman.

_La_. Oh she deliver'd to the life how you
Were troubled with the Stone. At first I did
Beleev't my selfe, and thinke of the sad consequence.
But tyme is pretious now: although our Starres
Have not been yet propitious to our meeting
Ile try my art to night to make 'em shine.
With happie influence on our Loves.

_Fra_. Most excellent Madam, how?

_La_. Ile not engage
Your visit to my chamber, since the first
Prov'd so unfortunate, but come to youres.

_Fra_. This night? wonot your husband be at home.

_La_. Yes.

_Fra_. You enjoy but one bed.

_La_. Without witchcraft, sir,
I have a stratageme to delude my husband
And all his jealous waking eyes, a plott
That cannot faile if you dare but expect me.

_Fra_. I grow immortall with my hopes and fancie
More than the worlds most pretious Empire in
Our first embrace. I should runne back into
An Infant once agen, and by degrees
And tyme grow up to meet so vast a happines.
Ages in expectation spent were poore
And easy sufferings weigh'd against this triumph!
Methinkes I am not man but something of
A more exalted essence: humane nature
Hath not capacity to understand
And owne theis spatious blessings.

_La_. No more rapture;
But with the confidence of a lover spread
Your equall thoughts, and in your heart and armes
Prepare an entertainement for that guest
That hath no life or name but what you give.
A kisse! and leave our soules to thinke upon
The joyes this night attend us.

_Fra_. Sullen day,
Do not tire now; tis downehill all the way.

                       [_Exeunt severally_.


_Act the Fourth_.

[SCENE 1.[260]]


    [_Captain,[261] Underwit, Courtwell and Musicians,
    discovered in the Tavern_.]

_Capt_. Come, my _Apollos_, my _Orpheuses_ or my _Bacchus_ his
Minst[rels], which, to leave poeticall expressions, in broader phrase
is Taverne fidlers, some of your new tunes, my Masters; doe you heare?

1. Do you meane Mr. _Adson_'s[262] new ayres, Sir?

_Cap_. I, Sir; but they are such phantasticall ayres as it putts a Poet
out of his witts to rhime to them; but let mee heare.

                                            1 _Play_.

_Capt_. No, I doe not like that.

                1 _Play againe_.

_Capt_. Nor that. (_Play againe_)--No, no, no, neither.

1. An't please your Worship, Mr. _Capt_., our Boyes can singe songs
to these.

_Cap_. No, no, saveing your presence, your Boyes have nothing,
sarreverence,[263] but Love songs, and I hate those monstruously, to
make thinges appeare better then they are, and that is but _deceptio
Visus_, which after some embraceings the parties see presently what
it is.
                                               _The Musique Playes_.

    (_Hee sings and reeks and fillips all the time
    with his finger, then sayees_:)

_Cap_. I, I, this thumping tune I like a life; a Song, a Song to it!

        _One Singes.
         This Song.

    _The Juice of Spanish squeez'd Grapes is It
    That makes a dull Braine so full of witt;
    The Lemonades cleere sparkling wine
    The grosser witts too, doth much refine.
    Then to bee foxd[264] it is no crime,
    Since thickest and dull Braines It makes sublime.
    The Stillyards Reanish wine and Divells white,
    Who doth not in them sometimes take delight?
    If with Mimique Gestures you'le keep you from sadnes,
    Then drinke lusty Clarett twill put you in Madnes;
    And then to settle you no hopes in Beer
    But wholesome Potts of Scotch ale though its deere_.

_Cap_. But looke you, Child, you say the Divells white in your Song. You
have beene ill catechiz'd, Boy, for a _White Divell_ is but a poeticall
fiction[265]; for the Divell, God bless us, Child, is blacke.

_Boy_. No, Captaine, I say white wine at the Divell.

_Cap_. That's true; thats a good Boy, indeed. _Underwit_, lend mee a
Peice to give these harmonious men there. And now begon, my Masters,
without noise, for I will have no more fiddle-faddle for my money, no
tunes of supererrogation after the Musicall Bill is paid.

                                    [_Exeunt[266] omnes_.


[SCENE 2.]


    _Enter Thomas_.

_Tho_. They are all drunke already, and such Confusion in their heads
and tongues, my master kisses the next man and calls him Mistres
_Dorothy_; Mr. _Courtwell_, possest with the spiritt of defiance to
_Cupid_, is ready to beat him for being in love; my Projector dead drunk
in a Chaire, and the Captaine peepeing into his mouth like a tooth
drawer and powring downe sack which he feeles not, but his chapps shut
againe like a spring lock till he returne with a key to open his teeth,
to poure in the next health.

    _Enter Courtwell_.

_Cou_. My Cloake and sword, Drawer.

_Tho_. Tis here, sir.

_Cou_. Thou art a pretty fellow; here's half a Crowne, say I am
gone _Thomas_.

_Tho_. You are pretty well.

    _Enter Captaine and Underwit_.

_Un_. What shalls doe with him; this Engine burnes like _Etna_.

_Cap_. Throw him into the River.

_Un_. Hee's able to mull the _Thames_ well, for my owne part would
Mistresse _Dorothy_ were here to open her files.

_Cou_. Did you not name a woman. I will have no mention of any thing
that's female.

_Un_. May not a man talke of Sack?

_Cap_. Sack is a soveraigne medicine.

_Un_. Oh very Soveraigne.

_Cap_. Is it not _hic et hec_ sack, both for he and she. Stay, is my
Countryman gone? come hither, _Thomas_; do you thinke I am drunke?

_Tho_. Truly, Captaine, I cannot tell.

_Cap_. You cannot tell? there's your ignorance. Drink is a vice I am as
little given to as another man, for I doe abhorre it in my selfe. I do
wonder how any reasonable man can be drunk; therefore every wise man
take Counsell and example by me, and he may see very plainely what an
odious thing it is; for you must follow your leader, and vertue, which
is an Antient--

_Tho_. Vertue an Antient?

_Cap_. I, an Antient old gentlewoman that is growne very poore, and
nobodie knowes where she dwells very hard to find her out, especially
for a Capt.; you will find it very difficult for a Livetenent. But wee
will endeavour the best wee can; you see my courses, I have travel'd to
find her out, and I could never yet see her at a baudihouse.

_Un_. Who is to be seene at a baudihouse? to the right hand countermarch.

_Tho_. He talkes of vertue, sir.

_Un_. Vertue? she never comes there; why do you thinke she should be
there, Captaine?

_Cap_. Why, because she is an old gentlewoman and might keepe the house.

_Tho_. Alas, Captaine, Mistris _Vertue_ is poore and leane.

_Cap_. Nay, then she is not fit to be a baud, but tell me did you ever
see her, or if so did you ever doo't with her?

_Un_. No, but twas none of my fault; I know not what I may do in time
when she understands the wordes of Command.

_Tho_. He does not meane Mistris _Dorothy_: but, Captaine, I would faine
know the reason why your baudes are so fat still.

_Cap_. A plaine case: they lie fallow and get hart, then they keepe
themselves so in health and so soluble with stewd prunes; and then
sipping of sack is a great matter to fatten 'em. But they are as good
people as a man shall keepe company withall, and bring up the young
gentlewomen so vertuously. I came into one of their houses tother day
for a carreere, and I found the baud sick upon her death bed, very
religious and much given to repentance for those poore sins she had
comitted. When she had taken order for her soule, she told me the young
gentlewoman I look'd for was in the next roome; and desiring her upon
her blessing to give me content, she turnes herselfe to the wall and
gives up the ghost very privatly, because she was loth to trouble us.

_Un_. By your relation theis appeare to be very good people. What if we
went to visit one of these Matrons? I have a great mind--

_Cap_. Wy, now you speake like an understanding soldier, and one that
may come to something in the end. Lett us therefore march on.

_Un_. March on to _Venus_ Warres.

_Cap_. For you know, _Thomas_, that the Spider and the Bee, the Spider
and the Bee, do both--something, but in troth I have forgott what tis.

_Un_. Tis no matter what; let us goe.

_Cap_. Goe? no more but goe? though I be a Captaine, if I be not chosen
in this imployment--

_Tho_. What, then, Captaine?

_Cap_. Why, then--I cannot goe.

_Tho_. Very right; but wo' not those young gentlewomen you talk'd of
give a man something to make a man afraid of pepper upon occasion?

_Cap_. You will be prating so long till I breake your head for
pretending to that which you have not, sirra.

_Tho_. Alas, I never had it in my life.

_Un_. What's that, Captaine?

_Cap_. Wit, I talke of wit.

_Un_, Who has any wit? does my man offer to have wit?

_Cap_. Nay, take no offence at it, for I meant none to either of you
by this sack. Drawer, give me my oath, cannot you drinke without wit?
cannot you game without wit?

_Un_. And yet by your favour the gamesters are cald the wits now.

_Cap_. Tis no wit to cozen; confederacy and dishonesty will doo't
without wit. Ile iustifie it: do not you know the receit of Cozenage?
take an ounce of knavery at the least,--and confederacie is but so many
knaves put together,--then you must take a very fine young Codling heire
and pound him as small as you can.

_Un_. And what then, Captaine?

_Cap_. Why, then you must cozen him.

_Un_. But which way?

_Cap_. Which way? Why, which way you will: is not cozen him enough? thou
art a pretty fellow, ile talke with thee. Thy name's _Thomas_; take
heed, I say still, _Thomas_, of being drunke, for it doth drowne the
mortall soule; and yours cannot swim, _Thomas_,--can it?

_Tho_. Not as I know, Captaine; if it scape fire tis as much as I
looke for.

_Within Eng_. Oh--oh--

_Cap_. What's that?

_Tho_. Tis Mr. _Engine_ recovered from his dead sleepe.    [_Exit_.

_Un_. D'ee heare, Captaine, for all this I have a great mind to a wench,
and a wench I must have if there be one above ground. Oh _London,
London_, thou art full of frank tenements, give me _London_. Shall we
wheele about yet?

_Cap_. Give you _London_? Wo'nott _Cheapeside_ serve your turne, or the
_Exchange_?

    _Enter Thomas_.

_Tho_. Oh, gentlemen, Mr. _Engine_ is surely bewitch'd.

_Cap_. What, what's the matter? bring the witch and Mr. _Engine_
before us.

_Tho_. He does vomit the strangest things yonder.

_Cap_. Did not I say, murder will out?

_Tho_. I thinke he has eaten and drunke nothing but Monopolies, and too
hard to be digested they come up againe.

_Within Eng_. Oh!

_Tho_. Harke, I must hold his head.    [_Exit_.

_Cap_. Did not I tell you something would come out?

_Tho_. Pins, pins, they lay across his throat. I told you he was
bewitch'd. Heyday! cards and dice, out with 'em, the Divells a gamester
and paies the box soundly--Now, now, now.

_Un_. Whats that?

_Tho_. Tis something clammy,--now,--oh, tis sope!

_Cap_. Sope? give a man leave to wash his mouth.

_Un_. Does not the lyme burne his throat, _Thomas_?

_Tho_. Alas, poore gentleman, something now agen is ready to strangle
him; out with em,--hides, hides,--it was the hornes stuck in his gullett.

_Within_. Oh--

_Tho_. Well straind; what a foule stomack he has! open your mouth,
Mr. _Engine_.

_Cap_. Throw downe a pottlepot.

_Tho_. I have, sir, and it has come up full of medium wine; if you have
any charity come and helpe me to hold his head; now agen!

_Within_. Oh, oh, oh!

_Un_. This is very strange, Captaine; the man is certainely enchanted.

_Tho_. Master, master, tis _Shrovetuesday_[267] and the prentices are
pulling downe _Covent Garden_; the Brickes come as whole out as if he
had swallowed Cherristones. Hey! will you take Tobacco in the Roll? here
is a whole shiplading of _Bermudas_ and one little twopenny paper of
berrinas, with a superscription 'To my very loving friends the
Custome-house.'

_Cap_. Put up that for a relique, _Thomas_, and open it upon high dayes
to clear the sore eyes of our _Spanish_ Marchants. _Thomas_, no more,
but call the Drawer, an understanding Drawer and one that writes
orthographie.

    [_Enter Drawer_.

--Sirra, I charge you set a padlock upon that Chamber doore; there is a
dangerous fellow must be brought to his purgation. And looke all the
goods that he hath vomitted be forthcomeing, while we discreetly goe and
enforme the Magistrates.--At your perill, sirra, at your perill seale up
the Doore; and do you pay the reckoninge.

_Un_. Sir _Richard_ is a Justice. There's your money, and yet wee need
not pay; the gentleman hath left enough for the Reckoning in the next
Roome.

_Un_. I ha made him fast, you are very welcome, gentlemen. All's paid in
the Percullis.

                  [_Exeunt_.


[SCENE 3.]


    _Enter Courtwell and Sister_.

_Sis_. Ile walke no further; if you have a secret
To impart, you need not feare this place; the trees
And hedges will not listen. What's the business?
I hope your phlegmatick stock of verse is spent.

_Cou_. Why then in prose, the worst that I can speake in,
I doe not love you, Lady.

_Sis_. How? you ha not
Traind me thus farr to tell me that?

_Cou_. You are
Of all your sex the poorest emptiest trifle,
And one with whome tis most impossible
I ere should change Affection; theres nothing
To invite me too't, not so much as that
Wee call a seeming reason, upon which
All Love is built, seeming, I say, not it,
My understanding Ladie.

_Sis_. You thinke I am very dull that you expound
Your witt thus, but it needes no Comentator,
Not by the Author, tis so very plaine;
But to despise me most of all the sexe
Is something oversaid. Though I affect
No flattery, I hate uncivill Language.
You do not meane to quarrell, now you have
Betraid me to the feilds, and beat me, Sir?

_Cou_. What is there in your face more to attract mee
Then that Red Cowes complexion? Why the Divell
Do you thinke I should dote upon your person?
That thing when she is stroak'd gives milke.

_Sis_. By that
I understand all this revenge, because
You thinke I did neglect you. Pray, sir, tell me,
And tell me seriouslie, put the Case that I
Should love you now, could not you love agen?

_Cou_. In troth I thinke I could not.

_Sis_. You do but thinke.

_Cou_. Nay, ile bind it with an oath before the parish,
And when I have given my reasons, too, the Clarke
Shall praise me fort and say Amen.

_Sis_. What reasons?

_Cou_. I shall be very loath
To say your eyes are twinckling Starres agen,
Your lipps twin cherries and out blush the rubie,
Your azure veines vye beauty with the Saphire
Or that your swelling breasts are hills of Ivory,
Pillowes for Jove to rest his amorous head,
When my owne Conscience tells me that _Bunhill_
Is worth a hundred on 'em, and but _Higate_
Compar'd with 'em is Paradice. I thanke you;
Ile not be vext and squeez'd about a rime
Or in a verse that's blanke, as I must be,
Whine love unto[268] a tune.

_Sis_. This all your feare?

_Cou_. No, I doe feare to loose my tyme, my businesse,
And my witts too, jolting them all away
To waite on you in prouder Coaches.

_Sis_. Is this all?

_Cou_. To spend my selfe to nothing and be laugh'd at
By all the world when I shall come at last
To this reward for all my services,
To bee your lay Court Chaplaine and say gravely
A hastie grace before your windowes breakfast.

_Sis_. But how
Came you thus cur'd? You were a passionate
(I may say) foole, in hope you will deserve it.
What phisick tooke you that hath thus restor'd you?

_Cou_. A little sack had power to cure this madnes.

_Sis_. I hope you are not sober yet, the humour
May change when you ha slept.

_Cou_. Ile rather stick
My Eyelids up with Sisters[269] thread and stare
Perpetually.

_Sis_. Then you may see me agen.

_Cou_. I thinke I sha'not, unless it be to wonder,
When you are in the Ivie bush, that face
Cut upon Tafata, that creame and prunes,
So many plums in white broth, that scutcheon of
Pretence powderd with ermines. Now I looke upon't,
With those black patches it does put me in mind
Of a white soule with sinns upon't, and frights me.
How sell you grapes? Your haire[270] does curle in bunches;
You[r] lipps looke like the parsons glebe, full of
Red, blew and yellow flowers; how they are chopt
And looke like trenches made to draine the meadowe.

_Sis_. This rudenes
Is beyond the manners of a gentleman.

_Cou_. I cannot helpe it, and I hope you thinke so.

_Sis_. I am confirm'd that now I am forsaken,
But if your passion have not drownd all reason
I pray let us part civilly.

_Cou_. With all my heart; I dare then take my leave, to[o].

_Sis_. Whoe's there?

_Cou_. Where?

_Sis_. Behind that tree?

_Cou_. You have no plott to accuse me for a rape?
Twas at the worst but felony, for cherries
That look'd as they had been a fortnight gather'd.

_Sis_. I know youle bring me home in Curtesie.

_Cou_. Not I, I wo' not trust my selfe; and you
Will hardly meet a worse to interrupt you.
Fare you well, Ladie.--Do you see that Bull?

_Sis_. Yes, Sir.

_Cou_. That is a happie beast

_Sis_. Why happie, sir?

_Cou_. He writes no verses to his Mistresse, is
Not cosend nor forsworne to gett her favour,
Bestowes no rings nor empties his Exchequer
To appear still in new rich suites, but lives
Free o' the stock of Nature, yet loves none.
Like the great _Turke_ he walkes in his Seraglio,
And doth command which concubine best pleases;
When he has done he falls to graze or sleepe,
And makes as he had never knowne the Dun,
White, Red or Brindled Cowe.

_Sis_. You are unmanly.

_Cou_. Nay, I know you will raile now; I shall like it.
Call me a scurvy fellow, proud and saucie,
An ill bred, crooked Clowne; ile here this rather
Then live upon your pitty. And yet doe not;
For, if you raile, too, men that know you can
Dissemble, may beleeve you love me, and
Tis not my ayme.

_Sis_. You are a fine man!

_Cou_. I am in my best clothes?

_Sis_. I perceave
That tis truth now what the world saies of you,
And yet tis strange.

_Cou_. 'Twere strange it should be otherwise.

_Sis_. You give your tongue a licence, nor will I hope
Your malice should spare me abroad that have
So prodigally abus'd a Ladies fame
That deserv'd nobly from you; but you men
Care not whose name you blast with a loose character,
So you maintaine your pride of talke.

_Cou_. Howe's this?
It is confess'd I have talk'd in my tyme
And talk'd too much, but not too much of you;
For I but seldome thought of such a woman:
For any other--

_Sis_. Nay, sir, I am satisfied;
You can talke your pleasure.

_Cou_. Have I not done it, too?

_Sis_. Yes, by your own report, and with a lady
So much in vertue and in birth above you;
And therefore I expect not--

_Cou_. Stay; this moves me.
I never tooke a pleasure yet to lie
With Ladies fames, or ever thought that sport
Lay in the tongue. Such humours are for men
That live by brothell offices: let me know
Who hath traduc'd me to you thus, he shall
Be knowne no more.

_Sis_. Ile not be guiltie, sir,
Of any murder; when we meet agen,
And you in better humour, I may tell you.
So farewell, _Gondarino_,[271] nothing's lost
When you turne _Woman Hater_.    [_Exit_.

_Cou_. She has vext me.
If we make Matrimony after this rate,
The Divell is like to dance at our wedding. Ho!

    _Enter Device_.

_De_. Hee's here,
Alone too, and the place most opportune.
How shall I beginne?--Mr. _Courtwell_, do you love
Any friend of mine?

_Cou_. Not to my knowledge, Sir; I should be sorry.

_De_. Do not you love a gentlewoman?

_Cou_. If she be a friend of yours ile take the first
Occasion to neglect her for your sake.

_De_. It will become your wisdome and your safety.

_Cou_. What mischiefe have done to your face?

_De_. My face?

_Cou_. You looke so scurvily; come hither, thou
New Monster, with more feet then a Caterpiller;
What tyme a day ist? you that move upon
So many wheeles, say, Monsier, are you not
A walkeing Clock? I have a mighty mind
To see you tooke a peeces.

_De_. I doe not like this.--
You wo'not put me, sir, together againe.

_Cou_. I wo'not take the paines. Why do you smile now?

_De_. At your conceite to thinke I was a Clock:
I am a watch, I never strike.--Hee's valiant.

_Cou_. You have pretty colours there; are these your Mistresses?

_De_. If you did know the mistery you would applaud 'em.
Have you read _Livre de blason_? What meane you?

_Cou_. I will bestow 'em, sir, upon some forehorse?
They will become a countrey teame rarely.

_De_. Mor bleu!
Why, you dare fight, it seemes, and I was told
You were no Cavellier, a very dreame [droane?]
A wedg for men to breake their swords upon.
I shall never trust fame agen for your sake.

_Cou_. Thou never cosendst me.

_De_. I was never so illiterate in man.

_Cou_. For I did ever thinke thou durst not fence
But at a complement; a glittering vapour,
A thing of clothes and fitt for chambermaides
To whet their witts upon, but now resolve
Either to have your skin flead of or fight wo' me
For troubling my present meditations.

_De_. Why, sir, if you be serious I shall quit
That prejudice you have upon my valour.
Looke you, sir, I can draw, and thus provok'd
I dare chastise you, too. Cause I was merry
I was not bound to feed your spleen eternally
With laughter; yet I am not ignorant
What an advantage, sir, your weapon gives you
In length.

_Cou_. Wee'le change; why, this is honour in thee.

  [_They measure and Device getts both weapons_.

_De_. Now, sir, keepe of.

_Cou_. Th'art not so base?

_De_. I never cosen'd you, do you remember?
These two will guide me on the rope.

_Cou_. You meane to dance, then?

_De_. Yes, the Canaries,[272] but with quicker tyme
Then you, I hope, can follow: thus I begin.
Fa, la, la, &c.    [_Excurrit_.

_Cou_. What a heathen Coward's this? how the rogue tripps like a fairie
to the towne with 'em! He has been a footman, sure; I have not aire
enough to overtake him, and twill be darke presently. If I loose the
sight on him ile search the towne, and if I find him not there, pursue
him with hue and cries and after hang him.

                                   [_Exit_.


[SCENE 4.]


    _Enter Sir Francis, a taper prepar'd_.

_Fra_. The sun whose busie eye is still employ'd
A spie upon our actions, tir'd with waiting,
Is drowsie gone to bed, about whose pillow
Night hath hung all her wings and set up tapers
As if the Day were timerous like a Child
And must have lights to sleepe by. Welcome all
The houres that governe pleasure, but be slow
When you have blest me with my wishes. Time
And Love should dwell like twins; make this your bower
And charme the aire to sweetnes and to silence.
Favour me now and you shall change your states;
Time shall be old no more, I will contract
With Destiny, if he will spare his winges
To give him youth and beauty, that we may
Find every minute a fresh child of pleasure.
Love shall be proud to be no more a boy
But grow to perfect strength and bold consistence[273];
For when too Active Lovers meet, so happie
As wee, whose equall flames light to embraces,
Twill be no weight to number many yeares
In our delights and thinke all age a blessing.
But language is to narrow to expresse
What I expect, tis fitt my soule retire
Till she present her selfe; and, if it can
Measure my hop'd for ioyes with thought, prepare
To entertaine the happines.

                               [_Exit_.


[SCENE 5.]


    _Sir Richard and his Lady abed. Enter Dorothy with a Light_.

_Do_. I have set already my designe a moveing
To take my Captaine _Underwit_, who in wine
Was late more feirie upon me. I'th meane tyme
I cannot choose but laugh at the device
Wee have to cheat my Master; sure the Divell
Is a great friend to women that love men,
He doth so furnish us with quaint inventions.
Presently after supper she began
Her fitt othe toothach, and did counterfeit
So naturally; but since she went to bed
She almost rav'd by turnes:--I heare her at it.

_La_. Oh--oh, whoe's there?

_Do_. Tis I forsooth, I heard you groane and I
Have not the hart to sleepe. Shall I watch by you?

_La. Oh, no, no, no; get you to bed, make fast the Chamber;
I cannot endure the candle.

    [_Dorothy towards the dore putts out the Candle and returnes_.

_Ri_. Deare hart be patient.

_La_. I, you have your homilies of patience, but if you had my paine
twould make you wild. Oh!

_Ri_. Ile send for the _french_ toothdrawer in the morning.

_La_. Oh, there is no rack nor torture like it. What shall I do? I shall
never sleepe agen.

_Ri_. Which tooth ist?

_Do_.--The sweet one you may be sure which troubles her.

_La_. This, this, O that there.

_Ri_. They are happie that are old and have no teeth.

_La_. Oh, take heed, now it shoots up to my head.

_Ri_. Thou dost make my head ake with the noise.

_La_. If you knew what I suffer your head would ake indeed. I must rise
and walke in the Chamber; there is no remedy.

_Ri_. You will catch more cold.

_La_. Oh, no, no, deere life, do not crosse me; and you were in my
torment you would rise and trie any thing for a little ease. It cannot
be worse; the paine sure came with a cold, and who knowes but an other
cold may cure me.

_Ri_. I prethe come to bed agen.

_La_. So, so, do not troble me; I am now in some little ease; its a
heavenly thing to be goeing.

_Ri_. Dost heare?

_La_. Your noise will bring my paine back agen; if you knew what a
vexation it were for me to speake, You wo'not put me too't so. If you
doe talke I wo'not answere a word more, oh!

_Ri_. Well by this no light ile to _London_ tomorrow.

           [_She takes Dorothy by the hand and exit_.

Now do I see it is possible that a womans teeth should be as
troublesome as her tongue.

_Do_. Oh, oh!

_Ri_. I cannot choose but pitty her, that any woman should hold so much
paine in a hollow tooth.

_Do_.--If my Mr. touched with so much compassion should rise and force
me to bed with him, I must not cry out a rape; tis at the worst on my
side but fornication in my owne defence.

_Ri_. I prethe come to Bed.

_Do_. Oh, oh, oh!

_Ri_. The musick at a convocation of Catts upon a witches upsetting is
the spheres to this Catterwalling. I will thrust my head into the
pillow, as _Dametas_[274] did in a bush when the beare was a comeing,
and then I shanot heare her.

_Do_. Oh, this is a kind of Purgatory for sins of the flesh. If she
should fall asleepe with the tother knight it is not possible I should
hold out till morning; that which would fright away an Ague would put me
into a feare, I shall ha the toothache indeed with counterfeiting; I
have knowne some men caught the stammers so; my gums begin to murmure,
there is a feare all over my flesh, she will stay so long, and then---

_Ri. coughs_.--Uh, uh!

_Do_. Oh, oh!--Ile shift places to shew more distraction; at the worst
my noise shall be within his reach; it may give her notice to returne
too.
        [_Exit_.


[SCENE 6.]


    _Sir Francis a sleepe; a table, inke, and paper. Enter Lady_.

_La_. I am full of feares, and my owne motion frights me;
This furious love is a strange pilot. Sir,
Where are you? ha! asleepe! can any dulnes
That is not Death possess a gentleman,
So valiant in desires, when he expects
To meete his Mistresse? How I blush to raise him!
Was I not worth thy waking expectation?
Farewell; yet something that [like?] a charme that's fastned
To my poore hart restraines me. Inke and paper!
Ile leave him a short monument of this shame
And my neglected Love.    [_Writes_.
He knowes my hand: farwell, forgetfull Lover.
                                          [_Exit_.

_Fra_. What? have I slept? some witchcraft did betray
My eyes to so much darkenes; yet my dreame
Was full of rapture, such as I with all
My wakeing sence would flie to meet. Me thought
I saw a thousand Cupids slide from heaven,
And landing here made this their scene of revells,
Clapping their golden feathers which kept tyme
While their owne feet strook musike to their dance,
As they had trod and touched so many Lutes.
This done, within a Cloud formd like a Throne,
She to whom love had consecrate this night,
My Mistresse, did descend and, comeing toward me,
My soule that ever wakes, angrie to see
My body made a prisoner and so mock'd,
Shook of the chaines of sleepe, least I should loose
Essentiall pleasure for a dreame. Tis happie;
I will not trust my selfe with ease and silence,
But walke and waite her comeing that must bless me.
Forgive me, you bright starres, and do not frowne
That I have not attended as became
One that must live by your kind influence.
Not yet appeard? She did comand I should
With confidence expect her. Ha! what's here?
This Character, was not visible before.
_That man's too much compos'd of phleame
Will loose his Mistress for a Dreame_.    [_Reades_.
Tis her's, I know't; she has been here, oh fatall!
And finding me asleepe scorn'd to uncharme
My dull and cursed silence. This distracts me:
Have I so long, with so much Art and study,
Labour'd this honour, and obtaind what my
Ambition look'd at, her consent; and when
The tree it selfe bowed downe its golden fruit
And tempted me to gather, must I make
My selfe uncapable and be guilty of
So black, so base a forfeit? I could teare
My eyelids of, that durst let in a Mist
So darke and so destroying, must I sleepe
At such a tyme that the Divell must be over
Watche too! This houre hath blasted such a hope
As the Earth never teemd with nor the spring
Gave up in smileing blosomes to the breath
Of those sweet windes that whisper from the West
A tale of triumph to the yeere. I could
Dissolve with curseing of my Lathargie.
How shall I looke upon her face whose love
And bold adventure I have thus rewarded?
But passion cannot cure my wound; which must
Bleed till I see her, and then either cease,
Blest by her pardon, or dismiss a life
(Though iust) too poore a Sacrifice for her anger.
Where shall I hide my selfe and shame for ever!

                                          [_Exit_.


_The Fifth Act_.


    _Enter Sister_.

_Sis_. I cannot forgett my carelesse gentleman: his neglect and
reproaches have wrought strangely upon me.--Hee's here.

    _Enter Courtwell_.

_Cou_. Is there not a weesill crept into your Chamber, lady?

_Sis_. A weesill, sir?

_Cou_. A Mounsier sucklegge.

_Sis_. Do you take my Chamber for a henns neast?

_Cou_. There is a thing that calls himselfe _Device_,
One that will break the hart of a post horse
To continue a hand gallop with him; your Alamode,
Your fighting faery feather'd footed servant,--
When saw you him?

_Sis_. My fighting servant? has he beaten you, sir?
Perhapps he thought you were his Rivall; surely
I saw him not since yesterday.

_Cou_. Bu'y, Ladie.--
How many mile ist to the next Cutlers?
The rogue has pawn'd or sold my sword.
                            [_Offers to go forth_.

_Sis_. Dee heare, sir?
I can tell you now what Lady twas you did
Abuse so.

_Cou_. I abuse a Ladie! tell me the slave
Reported it. I hope twill prove this Mounsieur.
If ere we meet agen! Who wast?

_Sis_. Upon condition, sir, you will requite me
But with one gentle favour.

_Cou_. Any thing--

_Sis_. You must sitt downe and heare me then while I
At a distance thus deliver--

_Cou_. Tis more state.

_Sis_. I am most unfortunate.

_Cou_. In what, deare Damsell?

_Sis_. And much wrongd by a gentleman I lov'd.

_Cou_. Can he be a gentleman that dares
Wrong so much love and beauty? what's the offence?

_Sis_. He wo'not love agen.

_Cou_. And you would have
The stubborne man corrected?

_Sis_. I would be
Revengd if I knew how, and honour him
Should do me Justice.

_Cou_. Name the man; Ile doot.

_Sis_. I cannot.

_Cou_. How?

_Sis_. Yet turne your face: alas, it is yourselfe.
I have your word to punish him.

_Cou_. Sweet Ladie,
I am well acquainted with the worthy gentleman,
But will not kill nor strike him, for I know
He has just reason not to love you--you
Of all your sex; he told me so.

_Sis_. His reason?

_Cou_. Was in these wordes; suppose you hear him speak it;
Now do you sit--Lady, when I consider you,
The perfect frame of what we can call hansome,
With all your attributes of soule and body,
Where no addition or detraction can
By _Cupids_ nicer Crittick find a fault,
Or _Mercury_ with your eternall flame;
And then consider what a thing I am
To this high Character of you, so low,
So lost to noble merits, I despaire
To love a Mistresse cannot love agen.

_Sis_. This is a much dissembled Modesty.

_Cou_. Therefore give me the kinder Chambermaid,
That will returne me love for my two peeces
And give me back twelve pennyworth agen,
Which is as much as I can well receave;
So there is thirty and nyne shillings cleere
Gotten in Love, and much good do her too't;
I thinke it very well bestow'd.

_Sis_. But if I thinke you worthy, and accept
Your service, it destroies this other reason
For your despaire. Why, I can praise you, too.

_Cou_. No, lett it alone I have other reasons Lady
Among my papers. But to love or to be in love
Is to be guld; that's the plaine _English_ of _Cupids Latine_.
Beside, all reverence to the calling, I
Have vowd never to marry, and you know
Love may bring a Man toot at last, and therefore
My fine Gewgaw do not abuse me.

_Sis_. How can I
When you will neither Love nor marry me?

_Cou_. I was not made for a husband.

_Sis_. But I would make you.

_Cou_. I know what you would make me.

    _Enter Servant_.

_Ser_. Mounsier _Device_, if you be alone, would present his service.

_Cou_. Is he come?

_Sis_. Sir, do me but one favour, ile recant
My Love, I wonot have so much as one
Good thought on you; I will neglect you, sir,
Nay and abuse you, too, if you obscure
But for three minutes.

_Cou_. Ile have patience so long.

_Sis_. Admitt him.--I wilbe reveng'd o' somebody.--
Now, Sir.

    _Enter Device_.

_De_. I ha brought you a weapon, Lady.

_La_. Mee, what to do, Sir?

_De_. Tis Justice I present it to your feete
Whose love arm[e]d me to vindicate your honour.

_Sis_. My honour?

_De_. This is but the first of my valour in your cause;
If you affect these Monuments ile make
You up an Armorie; meane tyme receave
My Service with this sword: if he provoke me
To fight with him agen, Ile cut his hand of
And bring that wo' me to present the next.

_Sis_. Whose hand, deare servant?

_De_. He is not worth the nameing; las, this does not
Deserve your knowledge. Only thinke what I
Dare do when your bright name is question[e]d,
And I in tyme may merit to be cald
The darling of your virgin thoughts.

_Sis_. I pray stay.
My name traduc'd? who was so impudent?
Do me the grace to let me know on whome
Your valour had been exercis'd.

_De_. Why, the formall thing _Courtwell_; I would [not] call him
Gentleman; but that I ha baffled him
You need no other witnes but his sword
With that fine holliday hilt, Ladie.

                       [_She shutts the Doore_.

_Sis_. Looke you, sir, I ha made fast the Doore,
Because I meane before you goe to have
A satisfaction for the base injury
You ha done me.

_De_. I done you injurie!

_Sis_. Not that I value _Courtwell_, whome you would
Pretend has been to saucy with my honour;
But, cause I scorne to owne a goodnes should
Depend upon your sword or vindication,
Ile fight with you my selfe in this small vollume
Against your bulke in folio.

_Cou_. Excellent wench!

_De_. I was your Champion, lady.

_Sis_. Ide rather have no fame then heare thee name it.
Thou fight for a Ladies honour and disarme
A gentleman, thou! fence before the pageants
And make roome for the porters, when like Elephants
They carry once a yeare the Citty Castles,
Or goe a feasting with the Drum and foot boyes
To the _Bankeside_ and save the Beares a whipping
That day thou art cudgeld for thy saucy challenging
A sergeant with one eye, that was to much too.
Come, Sir, I meane to have a bout with you.

_De_. At that weapon?

_Sis_. This, and no other.

_De_. Ile rather bleed to death then lift a sword
In my defence, whose inconsiderate brightnes
May fright the Roses from your cheeke and leave
The Lillies to lament the rude divorce.
But were a Man to dare me, and your enemy,
My rage more nimble then [the] _Median_ shaft
Should flie into his bosome, and your eye
Change anger into smiles to see me fight
And cut him into a ragged staffe.

    _Enter Courtwell_.

_Cou_. I can hold no longer. You have gott a stomack, Sir, with running;
ile try how you can eate a sword.

_De_. Ha you an ambush, Lady? Ile cry out murder.
Is two to one faire play?

_Cou_. Let me cut one legg of, to marre his running.

_De_. Hold, let me speake.

_Cou_. What canst thou say for thy baseness?

_De_. Some men loves wit, and can without dishonour
Endure a jeast. Why, do you thinke I know not
You were here, and but obscur'd to see my humour.
I came to waite upon you with your sword, I.

_Cou_. How came you by'te? confesse before this Lady.

_De_. Dost thinke her witts so limber to believe
I could compell it from thee. Twas a trick,
A meere conceipt of mirth; thou sha't ha mine.
Dost thinke I stand upon a sword? Ile gi' thee
A case of Pistolls when we come to _London_;
And shoot me when I love thee not. Pox ont,
Thou apprehende'st me well enough.

_Cou_. But I am not
Satisfied: do you affect this gentlewoman?

_De_. Hum.

_Cou_. You will resolve, sir?

_De_. As may become a stranger; ile not loose
Thy friendship for all woman kind.

_Cou_. He dares not owne you.

_Sis_. I easilie forgive him; I should hate
My selfe, if I depended on his pitty.

_Cou_. Th'art a noble wench. Shall we leave of
These jigs and speake our harts in earnest? By
These twin lips I love thee extreamely.

_Sis_. Sweare by your owne.

_Cou_. They shall bee mine. Mounsier,
For your penance you shall along and witnes.

_Sis_. What, I pray?

_Cou_. The Priest shall tell you; come, we have both dissembled,
We do love one another.

_Sis_. Tis not possible.

_Cou_. Unless you will denie me i'the church.
I ha vou'd to lie with you to night: _Device_,
Amble before and find the parson out;
We will bee friends and thou shalt be her father.

_De_. I must maintaine my humour or be beaten.    [_Ex_.

_Cou_. Come, weele have no more acquainted.

_Sis_. Very pretty.
--I may deceave you yet for all your confidence.

_Cou_. If the skie fall weele have the larkes to supper.

                                              [_Exeunt_.


[SCENE 2.]


    _Enter Ladie, Sir Francis, Dorothy_.

_La_. It was strange neglect, sir.

_Fra_. I confesse it,
And not deserve to live for't; yet if you
But knew my sufferings--

_La_. Let her be Judge.

_Fra_. By no meanes, Madam.

_La_. You may trust her knowledge.

_Fra_. This is worse then a whipping now; these Ladies
Have no mercy on a delinquent. I must stand toot.
There is no tyrant to a chamberwoman
Made judg in such a cause; Ide give a Limbe
To be quit now, but, if she choose, I am
A Criple for this world.

_Do_. Ist possible a man and such a beast?

_Fra_. So, I must to the shameles.

_La_. What punishment can be equall to the offence?

_Do_. He lookes with some compunction for his fault.
Troth, Madam, choose an other night and trye
Whether he will sleepe agen.

_Fra_. Mercifull wench!
If we peece agen it shall be a good turne in thy way.

_La_. My husband is this day resolv'd for _London_;
It is his humour, or els, worse, suspition.
Ther's no pretence for him to stay behind.

_Do_. You have made ill use of your time, Sir _Francis_;
I know not how to helpe you. Seaven yeare hence
You may have such an other oportunitie.

_La_. Watch if my husband come not this way, _Dorothy_.
--Well, sir, though your transgresse deserve no pardon,
Yet I am charitable upon Condition--

_Fra_. Anything, Madam. This shewes exlent in you;
No pennance shall displease so you absolve me.
Bid me to clime some Rock or Pyramide,
Upon whose narrow spire you have advanc'd
My peace, and I will reach it or else fall,
Lost to the world in my attempt.

_La_. You speake
Gloriously; the condition that assures
Your pardon, 's only this--that you conclude
Here all your loose desires with a resolve
Never to prosecute or hope to enjoy me.

_Fra_. Call you this Charity? let me rather loose
Your pardon then for ever to be thus forfeited;
Bind me never to see you (and yet that
Were cruelty) then charme me to forgett
That I am man or have a hart, and you
A beauty, which your absence can as well
Make nothing as devide from my adoring.
It is not cure but killing to prescribe
I never must enjoy you. If you have
Resolv'd a Death upon me, let it bee
When we like Lovers have embrac'd--

_La_. It is not possible.

_Fra_. Nothing in love
Can be impossible to willing mindes.
Ile tell you, Madam--(sure the Divell has
Forsworne the flesh)--there may be a plot. I have it!
An exelent rare devise, if you but favour it.
Your husband is imediately for _London_,
I must in modesty ride with him; you
Are left behind.

_La_. How can that profitt you?

_Do_.--What a deale of submission these foolish men
Trouble us women with, that are more forward
To be friends agen then they are!

_Fra_. I will counterfeit a fall.

_La_. A fall?

_Fra_. I, from my horse; observe me, then--

_Do_.--My confederate, I hope, by this time is at gate
Enquiring for Sir _Richard_ very formally
From the old knight, his Master, and good Ladie.
The fellow has witt to manage it.

_Fra_. My footman shall pretend himselfe the Surgeon
To attend me; is't not rare?
Stand but to'th fate of this, and if it faile
I will sitt downe a Convert and renounce
All wanton hope hereafter. Deerest Madam,
If you did meane before this honour to me,
Let not your loving thoughts freeze in a Minuit.
My genius is a prophet.

_Do_. Sir _Richard_, Madam,
Is comeing this way.

_Fra_. Shall I hope agen?

_La_. I wo'not say you shall despaire.

_Fra_. You blesse me.    [_Exit_.

_Do_. My busines is a foote; your Jewell, Madam,
Will credit much the cause.

_La_. Wee will withdraw
And let me know how you have cast the plott.

                                  [_Exeunt_.


(SCENE 3.)


    _Enter Sir Richard, opening a Letter; a Footman waiting_.

_Ri_. From thy Master? his name?

_Foo_. Sir _Walter Littleland_.

_Ri_. I doe not know him.

_Foo_. His name is well knowne in _Lincolnsheire_ neere the fenns: there
were his family antient gentlemen before the Conquest; some say ever
since the flood.

_Ri_. _Littleland_!

_Foo_. But he has now more land then three of the best in the shire,
thanke the _Duchmen_ that have drunk up all the water.

_Ri_. They water drinkers?

_Foo_. Why not, as well as eate dry land? they are lin'd with butter,
Sir, and feare no Dropsie.

_Sir Richard reades_.

_She has been absent theis two yeares; the occasion, her dislike and
disaffection to a gentleman whome I confesse I did too seveerely urge
her to marry. If she have liv'd with you, as my late intelligence hath
enformed me, in the nature of a servant, which is beneath my wishes and
her condition, I hope upon this knowledge you will with consideration of
her quality (she being the onely Child and heire to my fortune) use her
like a gentlewoman. And though my yeares have made me unfitt for
travell, I do intend, upon returne of your Letters, personally to give
you thankes for your respects to my Daughter, whome I shall receave as
new blessing from you, and be happie upon any turne presented to
expresse my selfe for your favours, your true friend and servant_
                                            _W. Littleland._

My maide _Dorothy_ a Knights Daughter and heire! Doe you know your yong
Mistresse.

_Foo_. I shall be happie to see her and present her with a Letter & some
token from her Ladie Mother.

_Ri_. I pray trust me to deliver it.

_Foo_. With all my hart, Sir, you may comand.

    [_Enter Thomas_.

_Ri_. _Thomas_, pray entertaine this footman in the butterie; let him
drinke and refresh himselfe, and set the cold chine of Beefe before him:
he has ranne hard.

_Tho_. That will stay his stomach, indeed, but Claret is your only
binder.

_Foo_. Sack, while you live, after a heat, Sir.

_Tho_. Please you, my friend, ile shew you the way to be drunke.

                                    [_Exit. [Tho. with footman_.

_Ri_. To my loving Daughter. May not this be a trick?
By your favour, Madam.    [_He opens the Letter_.

    _Enter Underwit_.

Captaine, gather you the sence of that Letter while I peruse this. You
know Mistress _Dorothy_.

_Un_. I have had a great desire to know her, I confess, but she is
still like the bottome of the map, _terra incognita_. I have been a
long tyme hovering about the _Magellan_ streights, but have made no
new discoveries.

_Ri_. Ha! this is not counterfeit, I dare trust my owne Judgment; tis a
very rich one. I am confirmed, and will scale them up agen. My Ladies
woman Sir _Walter Littlelands_ Daughter and heire! What think you now of
Mistris _Dorothy_?

_Un_. A great deale better than I did; and yet I have lov'd her this
halfe yeare in a kind of way. O' my conscience why may not I marry her?

_Ri_. This Jewell was sent by her mother to her.

_Un_. Deere Uncle conseale till I have talk'd with her. Oh for some
witchcraft to make all sure.

_Ri_. I like this well; shees here.

    _Enter Dorothy_.

_Un_. I vow, Mistris Dorothy, if I were immodest twas the meere impudence
of my sack and not my owne disposition; but if you please to accept my
love now, by the way of Marriage, I will make you satisfaction like a
gentleman in the point of honour.

_Do_. Your birth and estate is to high and unequall for me, sir.

_Un_. What care I for a portion or a face! She that has good eyes has
good----Give me vertue.

_Do_. You are pleas'd to make your mirth of me.

_Un_. By this Rubie, nay you shall weare it in the broad eye of the
world, dost thinke I am in Jeast.

_Do_. Sir _Richard_--

_Un_. And were he ten Sir _Richards_, I am out of my wardship.

_Do_.--How he flutters in the lime bush! it takes rarely.

_Un_. What a necessary thing now were a household Chaplaine.

                                [_Ext. [Dorothy & Underwit_.

_Ri_. So, so, the wench inclines. I will hasten my journey that I may
appear with more excuse when they are married in my absence.

    _Enter Captaine and Engine_.

_Cap_. Sir, I heare you are for _London_ presentlie;
It will concerne you take this gentleman
Along w'ee to bee cur'd.

_Ri_. Mr. _Engine_ sick!

_Cap_. Oh, sir,
Dangerously; he has purg'd his stomack, but the ill spiritts
Are flowne into his head and spoild his eares.
He was ever troubled with Devices in his head;
I stronglie feare he must have his scull open'd,
His brains are very foule within. I know
And can direct you to an excle'nt Surgeon.

_En_. I cannot heare you, Captaine--

_Cap_. One that has a rare dexteritie at lanceing
Or opening of a stomack that has crudities;
So neat at separation of a limbe
And quartering of treason.

_Ri_. You meane the hangman?

_Cap_. He has practised late to mend his hand, and now
With the very wind and flourish of his instrument
He will strike flatt a projector at twelve score.

_Ri_. Does he not heare you?

_Cap_. He has lost that sence he saies, unless he counterfeits;
It wilbe your securitie to see him
Safe in the Surgeons hands.
                                  [_they whisper_.

_En_.--Into what misery have my Projects flung me!
They shanot know I understand 'em. That
I were quitt with loss of both my eares, although
I cut my haire like a Lay Elder, too,
To shew the naked conyholes! I doe thinke
What cursed Balletts will be made upon me
And sung to divilish tunes at faire and Marketts
To call in cutpurses. In a puppet play,
Were but my storie written by some scholler,
Twould put downe _hocas pocas_ and the tumblers
And draw more audience than the Motion
Of _Ninivie_[275] or the dainty docile horse[276]
That snorts at _Spaine_ by an instinct of Nature.

_Cap_. Ile leave him to you and seeke out Captaine _Underwit_.
                                                       [_Exit_.

_Ri_. Come, Master _Engine_, weele to horse imediately.

                                              [_Exeunt_.


[SCENE 4.]


    _Enter Courtwell, Sister and Device_.

_Cou_. So, we are fast enough, and now I have thee
Ile tell thee all the fault I find; thou hast
A little too much witt to bee a wife;
It could not be too nimble for a Mistresse.--
_Device_, there is a part still of your pennance
Behind. You would pretend to be a Poet;
Ile not disgrace the name to call thee one,
But let me have rimes against we go to bed,
Two Anagrams that weigh an ounce, with coment,
And after that in verse your Affidavit
That you do wish us joy, and I discharge you.

_De_. Tis tyme I were at study then.

_Cou_. About e'm:
Your double congey and depart with silence.    [_Exit Device_.
Now prethe tell me who reported I
Had wrong'd a Ladie? Wast not thy revenge
To make me angrie?

_Sis_. Twas, indeed. Now tell me:
Why at the first approach seem'd you so modest?
You have confidence to spare now.

_Cou_. Troth I came not
With any wooing purpose; only to please
My Uncle, and try thy witt; and that converted me.

    _Enter Thomas_.

_Tho_. Did you see my Master, Captaine _Underwit_?

_Cou_. Yes, hee's talking with the priest and Mistris _Dorothy_.

_Tho_. Her fathers footman was here; she is a knights daughter
And heire, but she does not know it yet.

_Sis_. I thinke so.

_Cou_. Where's my Uncle.

_Tho_. A mile ons way to _London_ by this tyme with
Sir _Richard_. I long to see my Master.    [_Exit_.

_Cou_. Wee shall want companie to dance.

    _Enter Ladie_.

_Sis_. My Sister.

_Cou_. If you please, Madam, you may call me Brother:
We have been at 'I _John_ take the _Elizabeth_'.
A possett and foure naked thighes a bed
To night will bid faire earnest for a boy, too.

_Sis_. Tis even so; Madam, the preist has done it.

_La_. May then all joyes attend you; if this had
Been knowne, it might have staid Sir _Richard_ and
Your Uncle one day more.

    _Enter Underwit, Dorothy, Captaine, Thomas_.

_Un_. Come for another Couple.

_Tho_. In hell[277]; my Master is married.

_La_. My husband left some letters and a token
Was sent you Mistris _Dorothy_. You did ill
To obscure your selfe so much; you shall not want
Hereafter all respects that may become you.

_Do_. Madam, I know not what you meane.

_Cap_. She wonot take it upon her yet.

_Un_. Theres the sport.

    _Enter Device_.

_De_. Oh, Madam, newes, ill newes, an accident
Will blast all your mirth: Sir _Francis_--

_Cou: La_. What of him?

_De_. Has brooke--

_Cou_. His neck?

_De_. You guest very neere it, but his shoulder
Has sav'd that joynt. A fall from's horse, they say,
Hath much endanger'd him.

_Cou_. My Uncle hurt!    [_Exit_.

_La_. He has kept his word; now if he but counterfeit handsomely.

_Un_. Mounsier _Device_, I must entreat a Courtesie; you have wit, and
I would have a Masque to entertaine my new father-in-law Sir _Walter
Littleland_. Mistres _Dorothy_, now my wife, is his onely Daughter and
heire.

_Do_. Who has guld you thus? I am no knights _Daughter_;
You may share your poeticall invention, sir.

_De_. Give you joy, Captaine.

_Un_. She is still loth to confesse it.

    _Enter Sir Francis, Lady, Courtwell, Sister, Captaine_.

_Fra_. If you have charity a bone setter.

_La_. He does counterfeit rarely.--Wheres Sir _Richard_?

_Fra_. He rid before, but I sent my footman to tell him this misfortune.
Oh, Madam!

_La_.--This is better then the toothack; he carries it excellently.

_Fra_. Aske me no torturing questions; I desire,
Madam, a little conference with you.
Ile thanke the rest if they withdraw: oh!

[_Cou_.[278]] Letts leave him.

_Un_. Wee'le to my chamber, captaine.

_Cap_. You have a mind to examine the business privatly?

_Do_. No, good Captaine, you may be present.

_Cou_. Come, _Thomas_, thou shat be witnes, too.

              [_Ext. all but Sir Francis and Lady_.

_La_. They are gone; they feigne most artificially,
Let me embrace you.

_Fra_. Oh, take heed.

_La_. What's the matter?

_Fra_. Tis no dissembling,--Madam; I have had
A fall indeed, a dreadfull fall; I feele it.
I thinke my horse saw the Divell in some hedge:
Ere I had rid three furlongs, gave a start,
Pitcht me of ons back like a barr and broke
A flint with my shoulder, I thinke, which strooke fire too;
There was something like it in my eyes, Ime punish'd.

_La_. But is this serious? are you hurt indeed?

_Fra_. Hurt? I ha broke my shoulder feelingly,
And I am of opinion when I doe
Enjoy you, Madam, I shall breake my neck;
That will be next. Ile take this for a warning
And will leave of in tyme.

_La_. This makes me tremble.

_Fra_. I will be honest now; and so forgive me.
Not the Surgeon come yet?

_La_. Heaven hath cur'd us both.

_Fra_. I am not cured yet. Oh for the bone setter!
If ere I counterfeit agen.

_La_. There is a blessing falne upon my blood.
Your only charme had power to make my thoughts
Wicked, and your conversion disinchants me;
May both our lives be such as heaven may not
Grieve to have shew'd this bounty.

    _Enter Courtwell_.

_Cou_. Sir _Richard_, Madam.

_La_. You may enter now, sir.

    _Enter the rest and Sir Richard_.

_Ri_. I do not like this stratageme; Sir _Francis_
Must not heere practise his Court tricks; I wo'not
    _Enter Surgeon_.
Trust my wives surgerie. Hee's come.--How ist,
Noble Sir _Francis_? Best withdraw; ile see
Him drest my selfe.    [_They lead out Sir Francis_.

    _Enter Underwit, Dorothy, Captaine, Thomas_.

_Un_. Madam and gentlemen, Mistris _Dorothy_ wo'not acknowledge she is
a knight's daughter; she sweares she knows no _Littleland_.

_Do_. Till it appeare to whom this gemme was meant,
Deare Madame, be you treasurer. I confesse
I have wealth enough in such a noble husband.

_La_. It shall belong to thee; be honest, _Dorothy_,
And use him well.

_Do_. With my best study, Madam.

_La_. Where is the footman you talke of?

_Tho_. He pretended Letters to carry two mile of to a kinsman of his
Masters, and returne presently. He dranke three or fower beere glasses
of sack, and he ran away so lightlie.

_Do_. His reward shall overtake him.

_Un_. Will you have her? she will doe you service, Captaine, in a _Low
Country_[279] Leaguer. Or thou, _Thomas_? ile give thee a Coppiehold.

_Tho_. You have one life to come in that lease, yet I thank you: I am
free, and that's inheritance; for ought I know she may serve us both.

_La_. Come you may perswade her to looke high and take it upon her for
your credit. The gullery is yet within these walles; let your shame goe
no farther. The wench may prove right, she may.

    _Enter Sir Richard_.

_La_. What news from Sir _Francis_?

_Ri_. Wife, I hardly aske thee forgivenes; I had jealous thoughts, but
all's right agen.

_La_. I will deserve your confidence.

_Ri_. No great danger, his blade bone dislocated; the man has put
everything in his right place.

_Un_. Dee heare, Sir _Richard_? wee are married.

_Ri_. Tis well done, send you joy; tis to my mind.

_Un_. Come hither, _Dorothy_.

_Cap_. But where's Mr. _Engine_?

_Ri_. He rid before.

_Cap_. If the rascall have any wit left he will ride quite away with
himselfe; tis his best course to fly oversea.

_Tho_. If he were sure to flie, he were sure to escape.

_Cap_. At the worst, drowning is a most [sic] honourable death then
hanging.

_Do_. My mother died, I have it by tradition,
As soone as I was borne; my father (but
No knight) is now i'th _Indies_, a poore Merchant,
That broke for 20,000 pounds.

_Ri_. The shipps may come home. Hee!

_Do_. You were best use me well, now we are married.
I will be sworne you forc'd me to the Church
And thrice compeld me there to say _I Dorothy_.
The Parsons oath and mine, for ought I know,
May make it halfe a rape.

_Ri_. There is no remedy;
We can prove no conspiracie. And, because
I have been gulld my selfe, gett her with child,
--My Doe is barren,--at birth of her first baby
Ile give her a hundred peeces.

_Un_. That's somewhat yet, when charge comes on. Thy hand! a wife can be
but a wife: it shall cost me 500 pounds but ile make thee a Ladie in
earnest.

    _Enter Sir Francis and Surgeon_.

_Ri_. How ist, Sir _Francis_?

_Fra_. My Surgeon sayes no danger; when you please,
I may venture, Sir, to _London_.

_Ri_. No hast now.

_Cou_. Not to-night, Sir; wee must have revells and you salute my Bride.

_Un_. And mine.

_Tho_. A knights Daughter and heire.

_Fra_. May all joy thrive upon your Loves.
--Then you are cosend of your Mistres, Mounseir?

_Do_. But your nephew knowes I have met with my match. Some bodie has
been put to the sword.

_Ri_. Come, we loose tyme.

_Fra_. Preserve your marriage faith: a full increase
Of what you wish confirme your happinesse.

                                           [_Exeunt_.


FINIS.


APPENDIX I.


The folio volume numbered Eg. MS. 1,994 contains 349 leaves. It was
purchased by the British Museum, for the very modest sum of thirty-three
pounds, at the sale of Lord Charlemont's library on August 6, 1865. Mr.
Warner (of the Manuscript Department of the British Museum), to whom the
public are indebted for an excellent catalogue of the Dulwich
Collection, thinks that the volume originally belonged to Dulwich
College. Towards the end of the XVIIth century Cartwright, the actor,
bequeathed to the College a number of MS. plays, which the College
authorities in the middle of the last century exchanged (horrendum
dictu!) for tomes of controversial divinity. Of all the plays left by
the actor only one[280]--and that imperfect--remains. The late Lord
Charlemont was a friend of Malone, and it is well known that Malone had
many of the Dulwich documents in his possession for years. Mr. Warner's
theory is that Malone lent the volume to Lord Charlemont, and that it
was never returned. The objection that naturally suggests itself is,
"How came so acute a scholar as Malone to fail to draw attention to a
Collection of such considerable interest?" And I confess that I am not
able to offer any satisfactory answer.

The volume contains in all fifteen plays, written in various hands. One
piece has the author's initials attached, but the others have neither
name nor initials.

First in order, leaves 1-29, stands Fletcher's _Elder Brother_. I have
compared the MS. with Dyce's text, and find the variations to be few and
unimportant. In III. 3 Dyce follows the old copies in reading:--

    What a noise is in this house! my head is broken
    Within a parenthesis: in every corner,
    As if the earth were shaken with some strange colic,
    There are stirs and motions.

As the words "within a parenthesis" were found in all the old copies
Dyce did not feel justified in rejecting them, although he had only the
most grotesque meaning to assign to them. Theobald rightly saw that
"within a parenthesis" was a marginal note, mistaken for a part of the
text when the book was sent to press. The MS. gives--

    Sweet heart,
    What noyse is in this house? my head is broken
    In every corner, as the earth were shaken
    With some strange Collick: there are stirs and motions:
    What planet rules this house? Whos there?

In III. 5 the MS. supports Mason's correction "Their blue veins _and_
blush disclose," where Dyce followed the old reading "_in_ blush."--At
the end of the play, after the Epilogue, are written the three following
Epigrams:--

    A freemans life is like a pilgrimage:
    What's his life then that lives in mariage?
    Tis _Sisyphus_ his toyle that with a stone
    Doth doe what surely for ease must be done.
    His labours journey's endles; 'tis no riddle,
    Since he's but halfe on's way that stands inth' middle.

                _Ad Janum_.

    Take comfort, _Janus_; never feare thy head
    Which to the quick belongs, not to the dead.
    Thy wife did lye with one; thou, being dead drunke,
    Then art no Cuckold though she bee a Punke.

    Tis not the state nor soveraintie of _Jove_
    Could draw thy pure affections from my love:
    Nor is there any _Venus_ in the skyes
    Could from thy lookes withdraw my greedy eyes.

Leaves 30-51 are taken up with _Dick of Devonshire_. Then follows an
unnamed play (leaves 52-73), written in a villainous hand. If I succeed
in transcribing this play I shall print it in the third volume, for it
seems to be an unpublished play of Heywood's. The next piece, entitled
_Calisto_ (leaves 74-95), which is written in the same hand, consists of
scenes from Heywood's _Golden Age_ and _Silver Age_. There are many
variations from the printed copies, showing that the most active of the
old playwrights found time to revise his works. Here is a song that was
omitted in the printed copy. Its proper place in Pearson's _Reprint_ of
Heywood is vol. iii. p. 67:--

    Whether they be awake or sleepe,
    With what greate Care ought Virgins keepe,
          With what art and indevor,
    The Jewell which they ought to pryse
    Above the ritchest marchandise,--
          And once lost lost for ever!

    Virginity is a rare gem,
    Rated above a diadem,
          And was despised never:
    'Tis that at which the most men ayme
    And being gott they count their game
          And once lost lost for ever.

Of the charming song "Haile beauteous _Dian_, Queene of Shades" the MS.
gives a far inferior version:--

    Thou _Trivia_, dost alone excell,
    In heaven when thou dost please to dwell
    Cald _Cynthia, Proserpine_ in Hell:
          But when thou theair art fyred
    And takest thy bugle and thy bowe,
    To chase on Earth the hart or doe,
    Thee for _Diana_ all men knowe,
          Who art mongst us admired:
    _Pan_ and _Pomona_ boath rejoyce,
    So swaynes and nimphes with pipe and voyce.

    Off all chast vestalls thou art queene
    Which are, which heretofore have been;
    The fawnes and satyres cladd in greene
          On earth wayte to attend thee;
    And when that thou on huntinge goest,
    In which thou art delighted moest,
    They off their active swiftnes boast,
          For which we all comend thee.
    _Pan_ and _Pomona_ boath rejoyce,
    So swaynes and nimphes with pipe and voyce.

We come now to a chronicle play (leaves 97-118), _Edmond Ironside: The
English King_. This piece had a second title--_A trew Chronicle History
called War hath made all friends_. It must be confessed that this old
play is a tedious business, sadly wanting in life and movement. The
following extract will give a taste of the author's quality:--

        _Enter Canutus, Edricus with other Lords and souldiers_.

    _Canutus_. A plague upon you all for arrant cowards!
    Looke how a dunghill cocke not rightly bred
    Doth come into the pitt with greater grace,
    Brislinge his feathers, settinge upp his plumes,
    Clappinge his winges and crowinge lowder out
    Then doth a cocke of game that meanes to fight;
    Yett after, when he feeles the spurres to pricke,
    Crakes like a Craven and bewrayes himself:
    Even soe my bigbond _Daines_, adrest to fight
    As though they meant to scale the Cope of heaven,
    (And like the Giants graple with the gods)
    At first encounter rush uppon theire foes
    But straight retire: retire? nay, run awaye
    As men distraught with lightninge from above
    Or dastards feared with a sodaine fraye.

    _Edricus_. Renowned Soveraigne, doe not fret your self.
    Fortune in turninge will exalt your state
    And change the Countenaunce of her cloudy browe,
    Now you must hope for better still and better
    And _Edmond_ must expect still worse and worse,
    A lowringe morning proves a fayer daye,
    Fortunes ilfavord frowne shewes shee will smile
    On you and frowne on _Ironside_.

    _Canutus_. What telst thou mee of fortune and her frownes,
    Of her sower visage and her rowling stone?
    Thy tongue rowles headlong into flattery.
    Now by theis heavens above our wretched heades
    Ye are but cowards every one of you!
    _Edmond_ is blest: oh, had I but his men,
    I would not doute to conquer all the world
    In shorter time the [then] _Alexander_ did.
    But all my _Daines_ are Braggadochios
    And I accurst to bee the generall
    Of such a stocke of fearefull runawaies.

    _South_. Remember you have lost Ten Thousand men,
    All _English_ borne except a Thousand _Daines_.
    Your pensive lookes will kill them that survive
    If thus to Choller you give libertie.

    _Canutus_. It weare no matter if they all weare slaine,
    Then they should neaver runne awaye againe.

    _Uska_. My noble lord, our Cuntrymen are safe:
    In all their broyles _English_ gainst _English_ fight;
    The _Daines_ or none or very few are slaine.

    _Canutus_. It was a signe yee fledd and did not fight.
                            [_turns towards Uskatant_.
    Ist not a dishonour unto you
    To see a foraingne nation fight for mee
    Whenas my homebred Cuntrymen doe runne,
    Leaving theire king amongest his enimies?

    _Edricus_. Give not such scoope to humerous discontent,
    Wee all are partners of your privat greefes.
    Kinges are the heads, and yf the head but ache
    The little finger is distempered.
    Wee greeve to se you greeved, which hurteth us
    And yet availes not to asswage your greefe.
    You are the Sunne, my lo:, wee Marigolds;
    Whenas you shine wee spred our selves abroad
    And take our glory from your influence;
    And when you hide your face or darken yt
    With th'least incounter of a clowdy looke,
    Wee close our eies as partners of your woes,
    Droopinge our heades as grasse downe waid with due.
    Then cheere ye upp, my lord, and cheere upp us,
    For now our valours are extinguished
    And all our force lyes drownd in brinish teares,
    As Jewells in the bottome of the sea.
    --I doe beseech your grace to heare mee speake.
                            [_Edricus talks to him_.

The next piece (leaves 119-135), which is without a title, is founded on
the Charlemagne romances. My friend, Mr. S.L. Lee, editor of _Huon of
Bordeaux_, in answer to my inquiries writes as follows: "Almost all the
characters in this play are the traditional heroes of the French
Charlemagne romances, and stand in the same relation to one another as
in the _Lyf of Charles the Grete_ and the _Four Sons of Aymon_, both of
which were first printed by Caxton, and secured through later editions a
wide popularity in England during the XVIth century. I believe, however,
that the story of the magic ring is drawn from another source. It is
unknown to the Charlemagne romances of France and England, but it
appears in several German legends of the Emperor, and is said to be
still a living tradition at Aix-la-Chapelle, where the episode is
usually localised (cf. Gaston, Paris, _Histoire Poétique de
Charlemagne_, p. 383). Petrarch has given a succinct account of it in a
letter written from Cologne, in which he states that he learnt it from
the priests of the city, and it is through his narrative that the legend
appears to have reached England. John Skelton in his poem 'Why come ye
not to court?' quotes the story, and refers to the Italian poet as his
authority (cf. Dyce's Skelton, II. 48 and 364, where the letter is
printed at length). Southey has also made the tradition the subject of a
ballad entitled _King Charlemain_ to which he has prefixed a French
translation of the passage of Petrarch. In 1589 George Peele in a
_Farewell_ addressed to Morris and Drake on setting out with the English
forces for Spain tells them to

    Bid theatres and proud tragedians,
    Bid Mahomet, Scipio, & mighty Tamburlaine,
    King _Charlemagne_, Tom Stukeley and the rest
    Adieu.

Dyce, in a note on this passage (Dyce's Peele, II. 88) writes: 'No drama
called _Charlemagne_ has come down to us, nor am I acquainted with any
old play in which that monarch figures.' But we know from Henslowe's
diary that in at least two plays that were dramatised from Charlemagne
romances the Emperor must have taken a part." Mr. Lee concludes his most
interesting note by suggesting that the present play may be the one to
which Peele alludes; but he will at once perceive from my extracts that
the date 1589 is much too early. Here is a passage that might have been
written by Cyril Tourneur:--

        [_Ganelon_ stabs _Richard_, his dearest friend,
        suspecting him of treachery.]

    _Rich_. O you've slayne me! tell me, cruell sir,
    Why you have doone thys, that myne innocent soule
    May teache repentance to you--    _dies_.

    _Gan_. Speake it out,--
    What, not a worde? dumbe with a littill blowe?
    You are growne statlye, are you? tys even so:
    You have the trycke of mightie men in courte
    To speake at leasure and pretend imployment.
    Well, take your tyme; tys not materyall
    Whether you speake the resydue behynde
    Now or at doomes day. If thy common sence
    Be not yet parted from thee, understand
    I doe not misse thee dyinge because once
    I loved thee dearlye; and collect by that
    There is no Devyll in me nor in hell
    That could have flesht me to this violent deathe
    Hadst thou beene false to all the world but me.

The concentrated bitterness of those lines is surpassed by nothing in
the _Revenger's Tragedy_. Indeed, I am inclined to believe that the
whole play, which is very unskilfully constructed, is by Tourneur, or
perhaps by the author[281] of the _Second Maiden's Tragedy_. All the
figures are shrouded in a blank starless gloom; to read the play is to
watch the riot of devils. Here is an extract from the scene where
_Orlando_, returning from the wars, hears that _Charlemagne_, his uncle,
has married _Ganelon's_ niece, and that his own hopes of succession have
been ruined by the birth of a son:--

    _Orl[ando.]_ I am the verye foote-ball of the starres,
    Th'anottomye of fortune whom she dyssects
    With all the poysons & sharpe corrosyves
    Stylld in the lymbecke of damde pollycie.
    My starres, my starres!
    O that my breath could plucke theym from theire spheares
    So with theire ruyns to conclude my feares.

        _Enter La Buffe_.

    _Rei[naldo.]_ Smoother your passions, Sir: here comes his sonne--
    A propertie oth court, that least his owne
    Ill manners should be noted thyeks it fytt
    In pollycie to scoffe at other mens.
    He will taxe all degrees & thynke that that
    Keepes hym secure from all taxation.

    _Orl_. Y'are deceyvd; it is a noble gentyllman
    And hated of hys father for hys vertues.

    _Buf_. Healthe and all blessinge wherewith heauen and earthe
    May comforte man, wayte on your excellence!

    _Orl_. Although I know no mans good wyshe or prayrs
    Can ere be heard to my desyred good,
    I am not so voyde of humanytie
    But I will thancke your loue.

    _Rei_. Pray, Sir, what newse
    Hath the courte latterly beene deliverd of?

    _Buf_. Such as the gallymaufry that is fownd
    In her large wombe may promise: he that has
    The fayrest vertues weares the foulest shyrte
    And knowes no shyfte for't: none but journeymen preists
    Invay agaynst plurallytie of liueinge
    And they grow hoarse ithe cause, yet are without
    The remedye of sugar candye for't.
    Offices are like huntinge breakfasts gott
    Hurlye burlye, snatcht with like greedynes,
    I & allmost disjested too assoone.

    _Oli[ver]_. I, but in sober sadnes whatts doone there?

    _Buf_. Faythe, very littill, Sir, in sober sadnes,
    For there disorder hurryes perfect thyngs
    To mere confussyon; nothing there hath forme
    But that which spoyles all forme, & to be shorte
    Vice only thrives & merrytt starves in courte.

    _Rei_. What of the maryadge of your noble aunte
    Oure fayre eied royall empresse?

    _Buf_. Trothe I wonderd, Sir,
    You spooke of that no sooner, yet I hope
    None here are jealyous that I brought one sparke
    To kyndell that ill flame.

    _Orl_. No, of my trothe,
    I knowe thee much too honest; but how fares
    The Empresse now, my dear exequetresse?

    _Buf_. Sir, as a woman in her casse may doe;
    Shee's broughte [to] bedd.

    _Rei_. What, has she a chylde then?

    _Buf_. I, my Lord.

    _Orl_. A Sonne?

    _Buf_. Mys-fortune hathe inspyrd you, Sir; tys true.

    _Orl_. Nay when my fortune faylls me at a pynche
    I will thynke blasphemy a deede of merrytt.
    --O harte, will nothing breake the?

    _Rei_. Tis most straunge.

    _Orl_. Straunge? not a whytt. Why, if she had beene spayd
    And all mankynd made Euenucks, yet in spyght
    My ill fate would have gotten her with chylde--
    Of a son too. Hencefourthe let no man
    That hathe a projecte he dothe wishe to thryve
    Ere let me knowe it. My mere knowledge in't
    Would tourne the hope't successe to an event
    That would fryghte nature, & make patyence braule
    With the most pleasinge obiecte.

    _Buf_. Sir, be at peace;
    Much may be found by observatyon.

    _Orl_. Th'arte bothe unfriendlie & uncharytable.
    Thys observation thou advysest to
    Would ryvett so my thoughts uppon my fate
    That I should be distrackt. I can observe
    Naughte but varyetye of mysseries
    Crossynge my byrthe, my blood and best endevours.
    I neare did good for any but great _Charles_,
    And the meare doing that hath still brought fourth
    To me some plague too heavye to be borne,
    But that I am reserud onlye to teach
    The studyed envye of mallignant starrs.
    If fortune be blynde, as the poetts houlde,
    It is with studyinge myne afflictions:
    But, for her standing on a roullinge stone,
    Theare learninge faylls theym, for she fixed stands
    And onlye against me.

I may perhaps be tempted to print this play in full. The MS. has
suffered somewhat, many lines having been cut away at the foot of some
of the pages. Although the first scene is marked _Act 2, Scene 2_,[282]
the play seemed to me to be complete. On the last leaf is written "Nella
[Greek: phdphnr] la B." Some name is possibly concealed under these
enigmatic letters; but the riddle would defy an Oedipus.

The next play (leaves 136-160) is entitled _The fatal Maryage, or a
second Lucreatya_. _Galeas_, on returning from the wars, crowned with
praises, is requested by his widowed mother to make a journey into the
province of _Parma_ to receive moneys owed by Signor _Jouanny_. On his
arrival he falls in love with _Jouanny's_ daughter, _Lucretia_, runs
away with her, and secretly marries her. _Galeas'_ mother, angered at
the match, practises to convey _Lucretia_ to a nunnery and get her son
married to an earl's daughter; but _Galeas_ defeats his mother's
machinations by killing himself and _Lucretia_. There is a second plot
to this odd play, but enough has been said. The meeting between _Galeas_
and _Jouanny_ is the best thing in the play:--

        _Enter Galeas & Jacomo_.

    _Ga_. You spake with him as I comanded you?

    _Jac_. And had his promise to meet you presently.

    _Ga_. I have heard much fame of him since my arrive,
    His generall nature, hospitable love;
    His [He's?] good to all men, enemy to none.
    Indeed he has that perfect character
    Before I see him I'm in love with him.

    _Jac_. Hee has the fame few Cittizens deserve.

    _Ga_. Why, sir, few Cittizens?

    _Jac_. His words his bond, and does not break that bond
    To bankrupt others; he makes you not a library
    Of large monopolie to cosen all men:
    _Subintelligitur_, he hates to deale
    With such portentious othes as furr his mouth
    In the deliverance.

        _Enter Jouanny_.

    _Ga_. Hee comes himselfe.

    _Jou_. Sir _Galeas_, if I mistake not?

    _Ga_. I weare my fathers name, sir.

    _Jou_. And tis a dignity to weare that name.
    Whatts your affairs in _Parma_?

    _Ga_. To visit you, sir.

    _Jou_. Gladness nor sorrow never paid mans debts.
    --Your pleasure, sir?

    _Ga_. The livery of my griefe: my fathers dead
    And mee hath made his poore executor.

    _Jou_. What? ought hee ten thousand duckets?
    Thy fathers face fixt in thy front
    Should be the paymaster tho from my hand.

    _Ga_. I doe not come to borrow: please yee read.

    _Jou_. Read? and with good regard, for sorrow paies noe debts.

    _Ga_. The summes soe great I feare, once read by him,
    My seeming frend will prove my enemy.

    _Jac_. Faith, if he doe, hee proves like your French
    galloshes that promise faire to the feet, yet twice a day
    leave a man in the durt.

    _Jou_. Was this your fathers pleasure?

    _Ga_. It was his hand.

    _Jou_. It was his writing, I know it as my owne,
    Wherein hee has wronged mee beyond measure?

    _Ga_. How? my father wrongd yee? I'm his sonn.

    _Jou_. Wert thou his father I'm wrongd,--
    Iniurd, calumniated, baffled to my teeth;
    And were it not that these gray haires of mine
    Were priviledgd ane enemy to vallour,
    I have a heart could see your fathers wrong--

    _Ga_. What? raile you, sir?

    _Jac_. Challenge a half pint pot.

    _Jou_. There in a sawpitt, knave, to quitt my self
    Of such an inury.--Hee writes mee here
    That I should pay to you tenn thousand crownes.

    _Ga_. As being due to him.

    _Jou_. But thatts not my quarrell, sir; for I did owe to him
    Millions of Crownes, millions of my love;--
    And but to send a note here for his owne!
    Ist not a quarrell for an honest man?

    _Jac_. With very few, I thinke.

    _Jou_. Why, looke yee, sir:
    When after many a storme and dreadfull blow
    Strooke from fire-belching clouds, bankrupt of life
    I have home return'd; when all my frends denide
    Their thresholds to mee, and my creditors
    Desir'd to sinke mee in a prisoners grave,
    Hee gave mee dying life, his helpefull hand
    Sent mee to sea and kept mee safe on land.
    Ist not a quarrell then to seeke butts owne?

    _Ga_. Oh, pray, sir--

    _Jou_. When all the talents of oppression
    Of usurers, lawyers and my creditors
    Had fangd upon my wife and family,
    Hee gave mee dying life, his helpfull hand
    Sent mee to sea and kept mee safe on land.
    Ist not a quarrell then to seeke but's owne?

    _Ga_. Good sir--

    _Jou_. Come in, sir, where I will pay all that you can demand:
    Noe other quarrell, sir, shall passe your hand.

    _Ga_. If every [one] should pay as well as you
    The world were good, wee should have bankrupts few.

    _Jac_. I'm of your mind for that.    [_Exeunt_.

We now come to a play (leaves 161-185), without title, and wanting some
leaves at the end, on the subject of Richard the Second. I think with
Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, who printed eleven copies of this piece, that
it is anterior to Shakespeare's play. There is less extravagance of
language than in most of the plays belonging to that early date (circ.
1593?); and the blank verse, though it is monotonous enough, has perhaps
rather more variety than we should expect to find. Much of the play is
taken up with _Greene_ and _Baggott_; but the playwright has chiefly
exerted himself in representing the murder of _Woodstock_ at Calais.
Before the murder, _Woodstock_ falls asleep, and there appears to him
the ghost of the _Black Prince_:

                     ... Oh I am nought but ayre:
    Had I the vigour of my former strength
    When thou beheldst me fight at _Cressy_ feild,
    Wher hand to hand I tooke King _John_ of _France_
    And his bould sonns my captive prisoners,
    Ide shake these stiff supporters of thy bed
    And dragg thee from this dull securyty.
    Oh yett for pittye wake; prevent thy doome;
    Thy blood upon my sonne will surely come:
    For which, deere brother _Woodstocke_, haste and fly,
    Prevent his ruein and thy tragedy.    [_Exit Ghoste_.

Undisturbed by this appeal, _Woodstock_ slumbers on. Then enters the
ghost of _Edward the Third_. His speech is worthy of Robert Greene:--

    Sleepst thou so soundly and pale death so nye?
    _Thomas_ of _Woodstocke_, wake my sone and fly.
    Thy wrongs have roused thy royall fathers ghost,
    And from his quiat grave king _Edwards_ come
    To guard thy innocent life, my princely sonne.
    Behould me heere, sometymes faire _Englands_ lord:
    (7) warlicke sonnes I left, yett being gone
    No one succeeded in my kingly throne, &c.

I will not inflict more of this stuff on the reader. Suffice it to say
that _Woodstock_ wakes in terror and calls aloud. _Lapoole_, the
governor of the city, who is close at hand with two murderers, enters
and comforts him. Here the playwright shows a touch of pathos:--

    Good nyght, _Lapoole_, and pardon me, I prethee,
    That my sadd feare made question of thy faith.
    My state is fearefull and my mynd was troubled
    Even at thy entrance with most fearefull vissions
    Which made my passiones more extreame and hastye.
    Out of my better judgment I repent itt
    And will reward thy love: once more, good nyght.

Now follows the _Lady Mother_ (leaves 186-211), which I have proved to
be a play of Glapthorne's. No doubt it is the same piece as the _Noble
Trial_, entered on the Stationers' Registers, June 29, 1660, but not
printed.

Then we have a masque (leaves 212-223). On the first page are given the
_nomina actorum_, and underneath is written "August 5th, 1643." I was
surprised to find in this masque a long passage that occurs also in
Chapman's _Byron's Tragedie_ (ed. Pearson, ii. 262). Ben Jonson said (to
Drummond of Hawthornden) that only he and Chapman knew how to write a
masque. The remark has always puzzled me, and certainly I should never
have thought of Chapman's name in connexion with this masque. Here is an
extract, containing the passage from _Byron's Tragedie_:--

    _Love_. For thy sake, Will, I feathered all my thoughts
    And in a bird's shape flew in to her bosome,
    The bosome of _Desert_, thy beautious Mistris,
    As if I had been driven by the hauke
    In that sweet sanctuary to save my liffe.
    She smild on me, cald me her prety bird,
    And for her sport she tyed my little legs
    In her faire haire. Proud of my golden fetters
    I chirped for Joy; she confident of my lameness,
    Soon disintangled me & then she percht me
    Upon her naked breast. There being ravishd
    I sung with all my cheere and best of skill.
    She answered note for note, relish for relish,
    And ran division with such art and ease
    That she exceeded me.

    _Judgment_. There was rare musicke.

    _Love_. In this swete strife, forgetting where I stood.
    I trod so hard in straining of my voice
    That with my claw I rent her tender skin;
    Which as she felt and saw vermillion follow
    Stayning the cullor of _Adonis_ bleeding
    In _Venus_ lap, with indignation
    She cast me from her.

    _Will_. That fortune be to all that injure her.

    _Love_. Then I put on this shepheards shape you see;
    I tooke my bow and quiver as in revenge
    Against the birds, shooting and following them
    From tre to tre. She passing by beheld
    And liked the sport. I offerrd her my prey,
    Which she receved and asked to feele my bowe;
    Which when she handled and beheld the beauty
    Of my bright arrowes, she began to beg em.
    I answered they were all my riches, yet
    I was content to hazard all and stake em
    Downe to a kiss at a game at chess with her.
    "Wanton," quoth she, being privy to her skill,
    "A match!" Then she with that dexterrytey
    Answered my challenge that I lost my weapons:
    Now _Cupides_ shaffts are headed with her lookes.
    My mother soone perceiving my disgrace,
    My Arms beinge lost and gon which made me a terror
    To all the world, she tooke away my wings,
    Renouncd me for her child and cast me from her;
    And more, to be revengd upon _Desert_,
    Comanded _Danger_ to be her strong keeper,
    That should she empt my quiver at the hearts
    Of men they might not dare to court her, fearing
    That horrid mischiefe that attends [on] her.
    On this I threw me headlong on the sea
    To sleepe my tyme out in the bottome off it;
    Whence you have puld me up to be a scorne
    To all the World.

    _Will_. Not so, my prety boy, Ill arme the againe;
    My breast shall be thy quiver, my sighes thy shaffts:
    And heres an opportunytey to be wingd againe;
    Se here the wings of _Fortune_.

    _Love_. _Fortunes_ wings
    Are full of giddy feathers to unsure
    For me to fly with all, but I will stay with you,
    I like so well this aire; onely you must
    Provide to keepe me from the hands of _Danger_
    That wayts upon _Dessert_.

    _Will_. Our selfes and all
    _Arcadia_ shall be your guard and wher
    _Love_ passes and recides he shall be allwayes
    Armd and attended by a band of lovers,
    Such faithfull ones as if that ugly _Danger_
    Were _Lucifer_ himselfe, they should defend you.

Next on our List (leaves 224-244) is the _Two Noble Ladyes, or the
Converted Conjurer_. This "Tragicomicall Historie often tymes acted with
approbation at the _Red Bull_ in St. _John's_ Streete by the company of
the Revells," is a coarse noisy play. The comic part consists of the
most absurd buffoonery, and the rest is very stilted. But there is one
scene--and one only--which shows genuine poetic power. It is where
_Cyprian_, the sorcerer, having by his magical arts saved _Justina_, a
Christian maiden, tries to gain her love:--

        _Enter Cyprian and Justina_.

    _Cyprian_. Doe not disdayne, faire peece of Natures pride,
    To heare him plead for love that sav'd thy life.
    It was my pow'rfull arte produc'd those monsters
    To drowne those monstrous executioners
    That should have wrought your wracke.

    _Justina_. Sir, I am sorry
    Hell had a hand in my delivery:
    That action cannot merrit my affection.

    _Cyprian_. I not alleadge it for desert of grace
    But argument of mercie: pitty him
    That in distresse so lately pitty'd you.

    _Justina_. I am the troth-plight wife of _Clitophon_,
    The Prince of _Babylon_; hee has my hart,
    And theres no share for others.

    _Cyprian_. That high state
    Is now at a low ebbe: destruction
    Hangs like a threatning Commet ore the walls
    Of _Babilon_. Then fix thy love on him
    That can more then the greatest prince on earth.
    Love mee, and princes shall thy pages bee;
    Monarchs shall lay their crownes and royalties
    As presents at thy feet; the _Indian_ mynes
    Shall be thy ioyntures; all the worldes rich marchants
    Shall bring their pearles and pretious stones to thee,
    Sweet gums and spices of _Arabia_,
    Fine _Median_ linnen and Barbarian silkes;
    The earth shall beare no fruit of raritie
    But thou shalt taste it. Weele transforme ourselves
    In quaintest shapes to vary our delights.
    And in a chariot wrought out of a cloud,
    Studded with starres, drawne through the subtle aire
    By birds of paradise, wee'll ride together
    To fruitfull _Thessalie_, where in fair _Tempe_
    (The only pleasant place of all the earth)
    Wee'll sport us under a pavilion
    Of _Tyrian_ scarlet.

    _Justina_. Should these rarities
    (Faithlesse as are your wondrous promises)
    Lead me into the hazard of my soule
    And losse of such ay-lasting happinesse
    As all earths glories are but shaddows to?

    _Cyprian_. Thincke you this rare pile of perfection.
    Wherein Love reads a lecture of delight,
    Ows not it's use to Nature? There is love
    In every thing that lives: the very sunne
    Does burne in love while we partake his heate;
    The clyming ivy with her loving twines
    Clips the strong oake. No skill of surgerie
    Can heale the wounds, nor oceans quench the flames
    Made by all pow'rfull love. Witnesse myselfe:
    Since first the booke of your perfections
    Was brought so neare than I might read it ore,
    I have read in it charmes to countermand
    All my enchantments and enforce mee stoop
    To begge your love.

    _Justina_. How ere you please to style
    A lustfull appetite, it takes not mee.
    Heav'n has my bow my life shall never bee
    Elder then my unstain'd virginitie.

    _Cyprian_. Virginitie! prize you so dearely that
    Which common things cast of? Marke but the flow'rs
    That now as morning fresh, fragrant and faire,
    Lay ope their beautys to the courting sunne,
    And amongst all the modest mayden rose:
    These wanton with the aire until unleavd
    They die and so loose their virginitie.

    _Justina_. In _India_ there is a flow'r (they say)
    Which, if a man come neare it, turnes away:
    By that I learne this lesson, to descrie
    Corrupt temptations and the tempter flie.

Leaves 245-267 are taken up with the _Tragedy of Nero_, which was
printed in 1624. Then comes [Daborne's] _Poore Man's Comfort_
(268-292), an inferior play printed in 1655. Afterwards follows a dull
play (leaves 293-316), _Loves Changlelings Changed_, founded on Sidney's
_Arcadia_. The last piece in the book (leaves 317-349) is _The
lancheinge of the May_, Written by W.M. Gent in his return from _East
India_, A.D. 1632. There is a second title, _The Seamans honest wife_,
to this extraordinary piece. On the last leaf is a note by Sir Henry
Herbert:--"This Play called ye _Seamans honest wife_, all ye Oaths
left out in ye action as they are crost in ye booke & all other
Reformations strictly observed, may bee acted, not otherwise. This 27th
June, 1633.      HENRY HERBERT.

"I command your Bookeeper to present mee with a faire Copy hereaft[er]
and to leave out all oathes, prophaness & publick Ribaldry as he will
answer it at his perill.      H. HERBERT."

It is plain therefore that the piece was intended for presentation on
the stage; but it must have been a strange audience that could have
listened to it. Dramatic interest there is none whatever. The piece is
nothing more, than a laudation of the East India Company. In tables of
statistics we have set before us the amount of merchandise brought from
the East; and the writer dwells with enthusiasm on the liberality of the
Company, and shows how new channels have been opened for industry. One
extract will be enough:--

    Nor doe our marchants tradinge into Spayne,
    The _Streights_, to _Venice_, _Lisbon_ or the like,
    Give entertaynment unto novices
    Which have not some experience of the sea.
    But when all doors of Charitie are shutt
    The _East India_ gates stand open, open wide,
    To entertayne the needie & the poore
    With good accomodation. Two monthes paye
    They have before hand for to make provision,
    Needfull provision for so longe a voyage,
    And two monthes paye theyr wives are yearely payd
    The better to mayntayne theyr poore estate
    Duringe the discontinuance of theyr husbands.
    Yf in the voyage he doe chance to [MS. doe] dye
    The widowe doth receave whatere's found due,
    Yf not by will disposed otherwise;
    Which often happeneth to be such a sume
    As they togeather never sawe the like.
    And when did any of these widowes begge
    For mayntenaunce in Churches as some doe?
    _Blackwall_ proclaymes theyr bountie; _Lymehouse_ speakes
    (Yf not ingrate) their liberalitie;
    _Ratcliffe_ cannot complayne nor _Wapping_ weepe,
    Nor _Shadwell_ crye agaynst theyr niggardnes.
    No, they doe rather speake the contrary
    With acclamations to the highest heavens.


APPENDIX II.


The following note is by Mr. Robert Boyle, of St. Petersburg, a
Shakespearian scholar, whose name is well known to readers of the
_Anglia_ and the _New Shakspere Society's Transactions_. Mr. Boyle, who
has a close acquaintance with Massinger, on seeing the proof-sheets of
_Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt_, pointed out several repetitions of
expressions used in other plays of Massinger. It will be understood that
I do not adopt Mr. Boyle's conclusions unreservedly. Possibly in an
Appendix to Vol. IV. I may return to a consideration of _Barnavelt_, but
the present volume has already swollen beyond its limits.


_Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt_.

This play, the most valuable Christmas present English scholars have for
half a century received, appears indubitably to belong to the Massinger
and Fletcher series. Even a cursory glance will convince the reader that
it is one of the greatest treasures of our dramatic literature. That
such a gem should lie in manuscript for over 200 years, should be
catalogued in our first library, should be accessible to the eye of the
prying scholar, and yet never even be noticed till now, affords a
disagreeable but convincing proof of the want of interest in our early
literature displayed even by those whose studies in this field would
seem to point them out for the work of rescuing these literary treasures
from a fate as bad as that which befell those plays which perished at
the hands of Warburton's "accursed menial." The present play has some
remarkable features in it. It is taken from contemporary history (the
only one as far as we know of that class in which Massinger was
engaged). It was written almost immediately after the events it
describes. These events took place in the country in which Englishmen
then took more interest than in any other country in Europe. There is a
tone of political passion in the play which, particularly in one place,
breaks out in an expression which the hearers must have applied to their
own country. There is no doubt that the audience wandered away in their
thoughts from Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt, the saviour of his country
from the Spanish yoke, as he professed himself in his defence on his
trial, and Spain's determined enemy, to Sir Walter Raleigh, whose head
had just fallen on the block, the victim of a perfidious foe and of a
mean, shuffling king. The following is the passage:--

    Octavius, when he did affect the Empire,
    And strove to tread upon the neck of Rome
    And all her ancient freedoms, took that course
    That now is practised on you; for the Catos,
    And all free spirits slain or else proscribed,
    That durst have stirred against him, he then seized
    The Absolute rule of all. _You can apply this_.    p. 292.

In a note Mr. Bullen informs us, that "You can apply this" is crossed
through. He does not state whether there is anything to show that this
was done by Sir George Buck, Master of the Revels, and consequently
Censor for the Stage. But this would appear to be the case, the more so
as the present play seems to have raised scruples in many places in the
mind of the dramatic Cerberus. It is hardly possible to imagine that the
spectators did not apply the "free spirits" to Raleigh, and the "Catos"
to those members who were shortly after to be imprisoned on account of a
memorable protest entered in the journals of the House, which Octavius,
who was trying to seize the absolute rule of all, tore out with his own
royal hands. There is a peculiar fitness in this hit at James as
Octavius which probably did not escape the audience. There is another
passage, on p. 253, which, singular to say, seems to have escaped the
notice of the Censor:--

    Such mild proceedings in a Government
    New settled, whose main power had its dependence
    Upon the power of some particular men,
    Might be given way to, but in ours it were
    Unsafe and scandalous.

Vandort, the speaker here, is opposing the idea of mercy to Barnavelt.
The language is very mild, but receives a peculiar shade of meaning when
read in connexion with the following passage by Massinger from the
_Virgin Martyr_, I. 1, 236:--

                   In all growing empires
    Even cruelty is useful; some must suffer
    And be set up examples to strike terror
    In others, though far off: but when a state
    Is raised to her perfection, and her bases
    Too firm to shrink, or yield, we may use mercy
    And do't with safety.

The _Virgin Martyr_ is noticed October 6th, 1620, as newly reformed. It
was probably written not long before. The two passages above mentioned
would seem to bring the two plays into connexion. But, it may be asked,
what proof have we that it was a production of Massinger and Fletcher?
As for the latter, there can be no doubt. His double endings are
sufficient proof. As for the Massinger part, there is first the
probability of his being Fletcher's partner, as the play belongs to a
period when we know they were working together; secondly, the metrical
style could belong to nobody else; thirdly, according to his well-known
manner, he has allusions to and repetitions of expressions in his other
plays. As I have gone through Massinger with a view to these
repetitions, I propose to notice those that occur in the present play.
When I allude to a play going under the name of Beaumont and Fletcher as
partly Massinger's, I am supported either by Mr. Fleay's tables,
published in the _Transactions of the New Shakspere Society_, or to my
own extension of these tables published in the _Eng. Studien_, a German
periodical for English literature and philology.

Act I. The First Scene is by Massinger, who almost always begins the
joint plays. On page 210 we have--

    When I should pass with glory to my rest.

Compare _Virgin Martyr_, V. 2. 319.

    When thou shouldst pass with honour to thy rest.

On page 211,

                             And end that race
    You have so long run strongly, like a child,

is a repetition of the idea in _Virgin Martyr_. On page 212 "Grave
Maurice"; here "Grave" is Count Maurice, who is also so called in
_Love's Cure_, I. 2. Bobadilla's speech. (_Love's Cure_ is by Massinger
and another author, not Fletcher.)

Page 213.

                    The desire of glory
    Was the last frailty wise men ere put off.

This occurs again in _A Very Woman_, V. 4, line 10,--

    Though the desire of fame be the last weakness
    Wise men put off.

Though the thought occurs in Tacitus and Simplicius, Milton seems to
have adopted it, as he has done many other of his most striking
passages from Massinger. It occurs also in at least one other play of
Massinger's, but the passage has escaped me for the moment.

Same page:--

                       'Tis like yourself,
    Like Barnavelt, and in that all is spoken.

An expression which, with a slight change from "spoken" to
"comprehended," occurs in almost every one of Massinger's plays.

Act I. Scene 2, is also by Massinger. On page 218,--

    We need not add this wind by our observance
    To sails too full already.

This reminds us of the common Massinger simile,--

    Too large a sail for your small bark.

And _Virg. Mar_., I. 1. 85,--

                               You pour oil
    On fire that burns already at the height.

Both similes occur in almost all Massinger's plays.

The situation on page 219 has a striking resemblance to a similar scene
with Cranmer in _Henry VIII_. Both Maurice and Cranmer are to be
disgraced by being kept waiting outside while their enemies were at
Council. I cannot help here repeating what I have expressed before, that
_Henry VIII_. as we have it is not the work of Shakespeare and Fletcher,
but of Massinger and Fletcher, with only fragments of the Shakespeare
play.

Act I. Scene 3, is by Fletcher.

Act II. Scene 1, is by Massinger.

On page 231 we have,--

              When the hot lyon's breath
    Burns up the fields.

Compare _Parliament of Love_, I. 5., Montrose,--

    When the hot lion's breath singeth the fields.

A little lower down, "At all parts" occurs in almost every play of
Massinger.

On page 232, "This I foresaw," is also very common in similar
situations. Among numerous cases I refer to the _Unnatural Combat_, Act
III., about the end, and _Maid of Honour_, II. iii., where exactly the
same words are used.

Page 233, "Be ne'er remembered," occurs in almost all Massinger's plays.
It is the most frequent of his many repetitions.

A little lower down. "And something there I'll do," is a well-known
Massingerism, occurring everywhere in his plays.

II. 2, is by Fletcher; 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7 are also probably his.

III. 1, is Fletcher's. On page 250 Barnavelt's hope that the soldiers
will regret him because he fed and nursed them, stands in flagrant
opposition to what Massinger says of Barnavelt's cashiering the Captain,
on page 215.

III. 2, is by Massinger.

Page 252, "But that is not the hazard that I would shun," is one of the
commonest Massingerisms. The passage on page 253 has been mentioned
already. Massinger is almost the only later dramatist who has a large
number of dissyllable "tions." We have here (253),--

    Of what condi_ti-on_ soever, we
    Palliate seditions.

His share of the present play presents many such cases.

III. 3, seems also by Massinger.

III. 4, is by Fletcher. On page 263 there is an unmistakable
reminiscence of _Henry VIII_., Wolsey's "Farewell."

III. 5 (also marked 4), is by Massinger. On page 264 occurs, "At no
part," one of the commonest Massingerisms; and a little lower down,--

                   Ever maintained
    The freedom I was born to.

Compare _Great Duke of Florence_, I. 1-4,--

    For I must use the freedom I was born with.

It also occurs in other Massinger plays.

III. 6, is by Fletcher.

IV. 1, is by Fletcher.

IV. 2, is by Fletcher.

IV. 3, is by Fletcher. Here occurs another allusion to _Henry VIII_.,--

                   And glide away
    Like a spent exhalation.

Compare _Henry VIII_., III. 2, 226:--

                               shall fall
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening.

Fletcher does not repeat himself often, and these two exceptions are
important.

IV. 4, is apparently by Massinger, but contains no repetitions.

IV. 5, is by Massinger. There are no clear Massingerisms, but the
metrical style, and the allusion to Raleigh already mentioned, make it
plain that the Scene is his.

V. 1, is also Massinger's. The end of this Scene I have not seen, as
pages 296-305 were missing in the proof-sheets I examined. Nearly all
Scene 2 is also missing. It and the rest of the play seem to be
Fletcher's, who, as usual, spoiled Massinger's fine conception of
Barnavelt, and makes him whine like Buckingham in _Henry VIII_. This
moral collapse of all energy in the face of death in the two characters
is significant. Massinger would have carried out the scene in quite
another tone. Some of the Fletcher scenes in this play, in which he has
an unusually large share, are surprisingly good, and remind us of
Fletcher at his best, in _Philaster_ and the earlier plays. He fails
here, as he always does, in the delineation of character. Nowhere is
this break-down more characteristic than in Buckingham and Barnavelt. It
gives the end of our play quite a wrench, and deprives Barnavelt of the
sympathies which we had been forced to turn on him through his intrepid
behaviour in the great trial scene. We had almost gained the conviction
that his aims were really pure, and here we are called on to witness his
utter collapse, in which he almost whines for pardon for his sins, and,
like all worthless fellows without character seems actually to soften in
gratitude to the man who sent him to his death.

This conclusion, I say, weakens the dramatic power of the close, but it
does not prevent Sir John Barnavelt from occupying a high place among
our dramatic treasures.      R. BOYLE.

Dorothea, Consort of George I_., &c. (Vol. i. p. 104. London, 1848.)
8vo.

[4] Mr. Fleay thinks that _Dick of Devonshire_ was written by
R. Davenport. "The conduct of the plot," he observes, "the
characterisation, the metre, the language are very like the _City
Nightcap_." The reader must judge between us. I find it difficult to
believe that Davenport could have preserved throughout five acts such
clear directness of style.

[5] The old form of "pop-gun."

[6] Xeres.

[7] Cadiz.

[8] Span. picaro, a rogue or thief. Nares quotes several instances of
"picaro" and "picaroon" from our early writers.

[9] It would be an improvement to read "enkindled," or "kindled at the
first."

[10] Cf. Heywood's _Faire Maid of the West_: part one (Works, II. 306),
"And joyne with you a ginge of lusty ladds." The meaning is "band,
company." The word is not uncommon among Elizabethan writers, and is
also found much earlier.

[11] Span. caraca, a ship of large size. Nares quotes from Beaumont and
Fletcher.

[12] Halliwell quotes Minsheu: "The Spanish _borachoe_, or bottle
commonly of a pigges skinne, with the haire inward, dressed inwardly
with rozen and pitch to keepe wine or liquor sweet." Hence the word came
to be applied to a drunkard.

[13] A stately Spanish dance. Nares' article sub. 'Pavan' is full and
interesting.

[14] The repetition of the words "such a" is probably a clerical error:
the Alexandrine is clumsy.

[15] Skirmishers or sharpshooters.

[16] Nares quotes from Taylor's _Workes_, 1630:--"So horseman-ship
hath the trot, the amble, the _racke_, the pace, the false and wild
gallop, or the full speed," &c.

[17] Street bullies, such as are introduced in Nabbes' _Bride_,
Middleton and W. Rowley's _Fair Quarrel_, &c. The exploits of a "Roaring
Girl" are admirably set forth by Dekker and Middleton.

[18] The full form "God refuse me" occurs in Webster's _White Devil_
(ed. 1871, p. 7), where Dyce quotes from Taylor, the water poet: "Would
so many else in their desperate madnes desire God to Damne them, to
Renounce them, to Forsake them, to Confound them, to Sinke them, to
_Refuse_ them?" "_Against Cursing and Swearing_," _Works_, 1630.

[19] "The Saturday Night, some sixteen sail of the Hollanders, and about
ten White Hall Men (who in England are called Colliers) were commanded
to fight against the Castle of Punthal, standing three miles from Cadiz:
who did so accordingly; and discharged in that service, at the least,
1,600 shot." _Three to One_, &c. (Arber's _English Garner_, I. 626).

[20] Sc. companions: _Mids. Night's Dream_, III., i.; Shirley's
_Wedding_, k. v., &c.

[21] Middleton says somewhere (in A Fair Quarrel, I think):--

    "The Infinity of Love
    Holds no proportion with Arithmetick."

[22] To "look babies in the eyes" was a common expression for peering
amorously into the eyes.

[23] Sc. fagot.

[24] "Barleybreake" (the innocent sport so gracefully described in the
first book of the _Arcadia_) is often used in a wanton sense.

[25] A common form of expression. Everybody remembers Puck's--

    "I'll put a girdle round about the earth
    In forty minutes."

Cf. Chapman's _Bussy D'Ambois_, I. 1.--

    "In tall ships, richly built and ribd with brasse,
    To put a Girdle round about the world."

[26] Furnished with "bosses," which seem to have been the name for some
tinkling metal ornaments. Nares quotes from Sp. _Moth. Hub_. I. 582:--

    "The mule all deck'd in goodly rich array,
    With bells and bosses that full loudly rung."

[27] Cf. _Spanish Tragedy_, sc. vi.:--

    "A man hanging and _tottering_ and _tottering_,
    As you know the wind will wave a man."

(Quoted by Mr. Fleay in illustration of the "tottering colours" in _King
John_, v. 5, 7.)

[28] One is reminded of Shakespeare's--

    "Had I _as many sons as I have hairs_,
     I would not wish them to a fairer death."--_Macbeth_, v. 8.

[29] "That e'er o'erclouded," I should prefer.

[30] MS. _Exit_.

[31] Eringoes are often mentioned as a provocative by early writers:
_Merry Wives_, v. 5, &c.

[32] Sc. mallet.

[33] Sc. I lying in my _trundle-bed_.

[34] To "make ready" is to dress; so to "make unready" is to undress.
The expression was very common.

[35] A large salt-cellar was placed in the middle of the table: guests
of importance sat "above the salt," inferior guests below. Abundant
illustrations are given in Nares' Glossary.

[36] In Brand's _Popular Antiquities_ (Bohn's _Antiq. Libr_., II. 70-77)
there is an interesting article on "Groaning Cake and Cheese."

[37] A large coach: the derivation of the word is uncertain.

[38] The next word is illegible in the MS. We should have expected
"_Exeunt Fer., Man., & attendants_."

[39] Vid. vol. i. 307.

[40] The schoolmen's term for the confines of hell.

[41] I have followed the punctuation of the MS., though I am tempted to
read, "What to doe? pray with me?"

[42] A stage-direction for the next scene.

[43] Sc. bravadoes.

[44] The biting of the thumb is here a mark of vexation: to bite one's
thumb _at_ a person was considered an insult (_Rom. and Jul_., i. 1).

[45] A diminutive of "cock" (_Tempest_, ii. 1, &c.).

[46] The conceit is very common. Compare (one of many instances)
Dekker's _Match me in London_, iv. 1--

    "You oft call Parliaments, and there enact
    Lawes good and wholesome, such as who so breake
    Are hung by the purse or necke, but as the weake
    And smaller flyes i'th Spiders web are tane
    When great ones teare the web, and free remain."

[47] The reading of the MS. is "snapsance," which is clearly wrong.
"Snaphance was the name for the spring-lock of a musket, and then for
the musket itself. It is said that the term was derived from the Dutch
_snap-haans_ (poultry stealers), a set of marauders who made use of it"
(_Lilly's Dramatic Works_, ed. Fairholt, II., 272). "Tarrier" must mean
"a person that causes delay": cf. a passage from Sir Thomas Overbury's
character of "a meene Petty fogger":--"He cannot erre before judgment,
and then you see it, only _writs of error_ are the _tariers_ that keepe
his client undoing somewhat the longer" (quoted in Todd's _Johnson_, sub
_tarrier_).

[48] "One being condemned to be shot to death for a rape: the maid [sic]
in favour of his life was content to beg him for her husband. Which
being condiscended unto by the Judge, _according to the lawe of Spaine
in that behalfe_: in steps me the hangman all in a chafe and said unto
the Judge. Howe (I pray you, sir) can that be, seeing the stake is
already in the ground, the rope, the arrowes, the Archers all in a
readines, and heere I am come for him." (Anthony Copley's _Wits, Fits,
and Fancies_, 1614, p. 120.) Here is another merry tale, with rather
more point in it, from the same collection:--"A fellow being to suffer,
a maide came to the gallowes to beg him for her husband, according as
the custome of _Spaine_ dispenceth in that case. The people seeing this
said unto the fellow: Now praise God that he hath thus mercifullie
preserv'd thee, and see thou ever make much of this kinde woman that so
friendly saves thy life. With that the Fellow viewing her and seeing a
great skarre in her face, which did greatlie disfigure her, a long nose,
thin lips and of a sowre complexion, hee said unto the Hangman: On (my
good friend) doe thy duty: Ile none of her." (p. 160.)

[49] Cf. _Rom. and Jul_., I., iii., 76, "Why, he's a man of wax," where
Dr. Ingleby (who has no doubt learnt better by this time) once took the
meaning to be, "a man of puberty, a proper man." Steevens happily
compared Horace's "_cerea_ Telephi brachia."

[50] The old spelling for "bawbles."

[51] "Slug. A ship which sails badly." Halliwell. I cannot recall
another instance of the use of the word in this sense.

[52] The "trundle-bed" (or "truckle-bed") was a low bed moving on
castors. In the day-time it was placed under the principal or "high"
bed: at night it was drawn out to the foot of the larger bed. Vid.
Nares, sub "truckle bed" and "trundle bed."

[53] The reading of the MS. is unintelligible. For _All_. I would read
_Alq_., and for "Law you?"--by a very slight change--"Love you?" (the
question being addressed to Henrico). Then what follows is intelligible.

[54] "Flay" is usually, if not always, written "flea" in old authors.

[55] MS. "For 3 hellish sins:" the word "For" is no doubt repeated from
_Fer_.

[56] The passage might be tortured into verse, somewhat as follows:--

                            "Nay but
    Shall I not be acquainted with your designe?
    When we must marry,
    Faith, to save charges of two wedding dinners,
    Lets cast so that one day may yield us bridegroome,--
    I to the daughter, thou to the mother."

[57] We ought, no doubt, to read "professed,"--a trisyllable.

[58] An allusion is intended to the tailor's "hell,"--the hole under the
counter.

[59] _Vide_ note on Vol. I., p. 175.

[60] MS. tracning.

[61] In the MS. the stage direction has been altered to "Enter Sir
Gefferie & Bunche." The whole of the colloquy between Sucket and Crackby
is marked as if to be omitted. Doubtless this was one of the
"reformacons" made at the instance of the Master of the Revels.

[62] Such would seem to be the reading of the MS., but it is not
quite plain. I suspect that the true reading is "tripe-wives" (cf.
oysterwives, &c.).

[63] I.e., Besár las manos (hand-kissing).

[64] MS. "will."

[65] Perhaps we should rather read:--

    "Fie, Sister;
     'Tis a pretty gent[leman], I know you love him."

[66] The words "I faith" have been crossed out in the MS.--as being
irreverent.

[67] MS. "whom."

[68] Cf. _The Ladies Privilege_, i. 1. (Glapthorne's Works, ii. 99)--

                           "For my services
   Pay me with pricelesse treasure of a kisse,
   While from the balmy fountaynes of thy lips
   Distils a moisture precious as the Dew
   The amorous bounty of the morne
   Casts on the Roses cheeke."

[69] In the MS. the word "witnes" has been crossed out and "vouchers"
substituted.

[70] The introductory part of this scene, up to the entrance of the
steward, had been omitted by the copyist and is added on the last leaf
of the play.

[71] In the margin we find the words "Well said, Mr. Steward: a good
observation."

[72] "Pride" has been crossed out in the MS.

[73] "What? does he plucke it out of his Codpeece? Yes, here lyes all
his affeccon."--Marginal note in MS.

[74] "A verrie politique drunkard"--"I think the barrell of Hedlebergs
in his bellye."--Marginal notes in MS.

[75] "Tis well his friends here to reconcile ... ... for assault and
battery elce."--the other words in the marginal note are illegible.

[76] "It were but cast away on such a beast as thou art." Marginal note.

[77] To "take in" is a common phrase for "to take by storm."

[78] Pappenheim fell at the battle of _Lützen_, November 16, 1632; but
there had been fighting at _Maestricht_ in the earlier part of the year.

[79] MS. pdue.

[80] The first reading was--"Hold, hold, good Captaine, tis our most
temperate Steward."

[81] 'Heere, here' is a correction (in the MS.) for 'what then?'

[82] MS. Trime.

[83] These words are crossed out in the MS.

[84] Therefore this play would seem to have been acted at the
Whitefriars, i.e. at the Salisbury Court theatre. (F.G. Fleay.)

[85] The "jig" seems to have been a comic after-piece consisting of
music and dancing. In Mr. Collier's _Hist. of Dram. Lit_., iii. 180-85
(new ed.), the reader will find much curious information on the point.
The following passage from Shirley's _Love in a Maze_ (1632) is not
noticed by Mr. Collier:--

                             "Many gentlemen
    Are not, as in the days of understanding,
    Now satisfied without a jig, which since
    They cannot, with their honour, call for after
    The Play, they look to be serv'd up in the middle:
    Your dance is the best language of some comedies
    And footing runs away with all; a scene
    Express'd with life of art and squared to nature
    Is dull and phlegmatic poetry."

--Works (ed. Gifford and Dyce), ii. 339.

[86] MS. him.

[87] The name of the musician, I suppose; but the reading of the MS. is
somewhat illegible.

[88] The passage at first ran as follows: "Umh, how long have I slept,
or am I buried and walke in Elizium as the poets faine? Goe to, where
are they? in the ayre? I can percieve nothing nor remember anything has
been don or said!"

[89] '_Grimes_. Soe, now retire a little. Ile play him one fitt of
mirthe on my trebble to rouse him. _Ext_.' These words occur in the
left-hand margin. Probably they should stand here in the text 'Ext.' may
mean either '_exeunt_' (musicians) or '_exit_' (_Grimes_ to disguise
himself).

[90] 'Who are these! ha! the towne waits? why, how now, my masters, whats
the matter, ha?'--Passage cancelled in MS.

[91] 'Bakside' is a correction (in the MS.) for 'buttock.'

[92] "Here Gent[lemen], share this amongst yee and pray for Grimes."
These words (addressed to the musicians) follow in the MS. but have been
scored through.

[93] The MS. gives "aurescion."

[94] The reading of the MS. seems to be "inuolute." Mr. Fleay suggests
"invocate."

[95] The repetition of 'loath' in the next line is suspicious.

[96] The arrangement of the verse is not easy: perhaps we should read--

    'Wishes for husband.
                  A proper Gent[leman]; Ime happy
     She has made so iuditious an election.'

Our author usually makes a trisyllable of "gentleman"; here it counts
only as a monosyllable.

[97] Between this word and the next there is a mark of omission in the
MS., and the words "t'were Sir" have been written above.

[98] What follows, to the entrance of _Thurston_, is marked to be
omitted. I have thought fit to restore it to the text. "Here's Mr.
_Thurston,"_ concludes Clariana's speech.

[99] Cf. a similar passage in Glapthorne's _Wit in a Constable_
(Works, I. 182):--

                                "a limber fellow,
    Fit onely for deare _Nan_, his schoole-fellow,
    A Grocer's daughter borne in _Bread-street_, with
    Whom he has used to goe to _Pimblico_
    And spend ten groats in cakes and Christian ale."

From Shirley we learn that the apprentices took their pleasure
in the mild form of treating their sweethearts to cream and
prunes:--

    "You have some festivals, I confess, but when
    They happen, you run wild to the next village,
    Conspire a knot and club your groats apiece
    For cream and prunes, not daring to be drunk."
                              (_Honoria and Mammon_, v. i.).

Pimlico seems to have been a place near Hoxton famous for its ales and
custards; cf. Mayne's _City Match_, II. 6.--

    "Nay, captain, we have brought you
    A gentleman of valour, who has been
    In Moorfields often: marry it has been
    To squire his sisters and demolish custards
    At Pimlico."

There is an unique tract entitled "Pimlyco or Runne Red cap, 'tis a mad
world at Hoggesden," 1609.

[100] I cannot find that "bob" is used as a technical term in falconry.
Mr. Fleay suggests that a "bob'd hawke" merely means a "hawk cheated
of her prey." I rather think the meaning is a "hawk beaten or repulsed
by her prey."

[101] From "A Kalendar of the English Church," p. 45 (Rivingtons: n.d.,
but 1865), one learns that "Marriage is restrained by Law at the
following times unless with a License or Dispensation from the Bishop
of the Diocese, his Chancellor, or Commissary, viz., from Advent Sunday
until eight days after the Epiphany; from Septuagesima until eight days
after Easter; and from the Monday in Rogation week until Trinity
Sunday."

[102] I venture to insert the word "poet": both sense and metre are
defective without it.

[103] In the MS. "thee" is corrected into "you."

[104] Some words have been cut away.

[105] MS. throng.

[106] "_Thu_. And here she comes, I feare me"--crossed out in the MS.

[107] Here a line follows in the MS:--

    "And verely she is much to blame in it."

It is crossed through, and rightly.

[108] "Puny" is not uncommonly spelt "puisne" (Fr. puisné) in old
authors.

[109] The metre requires "unman[ner]ly."

[110] MS. have.

[111] MS. puisants.

[112] The "Artillery Garden" was situated in Finsbury Fields, where also
was the place of exercise for the City Trained Bands. In the
"Antiquarian Repertory" (ed. 1807), i. 251-270, the reader will find an
interesting account of the Trained Bands and the Artillery Company. Old
writers are fond of sneering at the City warriors. The following passage
is from Shirley's "Witty Fair One," v. 1:--"There's a spruce captain
newly crept out of a gentleman-usher and shuffled into a buff jerkin
with gold lace, that never saw service beyond Finsbury or the
Artillery-Garden, marches wearing a desperate feather in his lady's
beaver, while a poor soldier, bred up in the school of war all his life,
yet never commenced any degree of commander, wants a piece of brass to
discharge a wheaten bullet to his belly."

[113] _"Vinum muscatum quod moschi odorem referat, propter dulcedinem_,
for the sweetnesse and smell it resembles muske," &c_. Minsheu's _Guide
into Tongues_ (apud Dyce's _Glossary_).

[114] "Mooncalf" (originally the name for an imperfectly formed foetus)
was used as a term of reproach, like dodypol, nincompoop, ninny,
dunderhead, &c.

[115] _Sc_. trifling fellow, noodle.

[116] The blades from Bilboa in Spain were esteem'd as highly as those
of Toledo manufacture.

[117] MS. two.

[118] "Striker" is a cant term for a losel, a wencher.

[119] "Mew" is a falconer's term for the place where a hawk is confined.

[120] This passage is repeated in _The Ladies Privilege_, at the end of
Act I.

[121] "Curst" is an epithet applied to shrewish women and vicious
beasts.

[122] This is the prettiest passage, I think, to be found in Glapthorne.

[123] MS. me.

[124] "Oh me" is crossed out, and "once" written above.

[125] The passage is bracketed in the MS., and was probably meant to be
omitted.

[126] MS. Its.

[127] Throughout the scene "judge" is substituted in the MS. for
"recorder."

[128] MS. know.

[129] This passage is bracketed in the MS. It could hardly have been
expected to escape official censure.

[130] MS. led.

[131] Bracketed in MS.

[132] Early Greek writers held up the Scythians as models of justice and
simplicity (Iliad, xiii. 6, &c.). Clearchus (apud Athen., xii. 27)
accuses them of cruelty, voluptuous living, and viciousness of every
kind; but, in justice to the Scythians, it should be added that in his
"animadversiones" to the "Deipnosophists" (when will somebody complete
and print Dyce's translation?) the learned Schweighaeuser in no measured
language accuses Clearchus of wanton recklessness and gross inaccuracy.

[133] "What is the matter there? looke to the prisoners," was the first
reading.

[134] The passage is bracketed in the MS.

[135] Erased in MS.

[136] Before correction the passage stood "And now, madam, being your
servant and _Timothy_ I bring you newes!" The words "Stay, stay Mr.
Justice," &c., were inserted afterwards.

[137] Bracketed in MS.

[138] The reading of the MS. appears to be "a lonly."

[139] Bracketed in MS.

[140] The MS. is a folio of thirty-one leaves, written in a small clear
hand: it was purchased for the National Library in 1851 from the Earl of
Denbigh.

[141] In May, 1622, "by reason of sickness and indisposition of body
wherewith it had pleased God to visit him, he had become incapable of
fulfilling the duties and was compelled to resign."--Vid. Collier's
"Hist. Eng. Dram. Lit." I. 402 (new ed.).

[142] Mr. Warner, of the Manuscript Department of the British Museum, to
whom we owe the excellent Catalogue of the Dulwich Collection, kindly
drew my attention to the autograph letter.

[143] In the right-hand margin we find "Jo: R: migh."--the names of the
actors who took the Captains' parts. Further on the name "Jo: Rice"
occurs in full. John Rice stands last on the list of Chief Actors in the
first fol. Shakespeare. The reader will find an account of him in
Collier's "Hist. of Eng. Dram. Lit.," iii. 486-88. It is curious that he
should have taken so unimportant a part; but perhaps he sustained one of
the chief characters besides.--"Migh" = Michael.

[144] It seems to have been no uncommon thing for officers to keep the
names of soldiers on the list after their death and pocket their pay:
cf. Webster's "Appius and Virginia," v. i., &c.

[145] The reply of 1 _Cap_., extending to thirteen lines, has been
scored through in the MS., at the instance, I suppose, of the censorious
Master of the Revels; it is, unfortunately, quite illegible.

[146] The MS. reads "_Enter Barnavelt, Modes-bargen, Leidenberck_,
Vandermetten, _Grotius_, Taurinus, Utenbogart, _Hogebeets_." Names not
in italics are scored through.

[147] MS. Tau. _Hog_.

[148] All the characters remain on the stage in spite of this direction.

[149] At first the line ran, "Of this proud _Prince of Orange_, at the
worst."

[150] MS. _Enter Pr. of Orange, Gr: Henrie, Gra: William, Collonells &
Captaines. Gr: Henrie_ and _Collonells_ are scored through. In the
right-hand margin is written the name of an actor, _Mr. Rob:_

[151] The words "I feele too" probably belong to another speaker.

[152] Fletcher is fond of using "ye" for "you."

[153] In the MS. there is a marginal note:--"I like not this: neither do
I think that the pr. was thus disgracefully used, besides he is to much
presented. G.B." The initials are those of Sir George Buc, Master of the
Revels.

[154] "Shellain" is a corrupted form of Dutch _schelm_--a rogue,
villain.

[155] The stage direction in the MS. runs thus:--"_Enter 1 Burger,
Vandermitten, Grotius." Vandermitten_ finally takes the place of
1 _Burger_ and _Grotius_.

[156] Beneath, in the MS., is written the name of the actor who took the
part, "Mr. Gough."

[157] In the right-hand margin are written the initials "R.T." It is
unknown what actor was the owner of them.

[158] "Jo: Ri:" is written above, and "migh" in the right-hand margin.

[159] "Mr. Rob." took the Captain's part.

[160] This Captain is identical with the one in the previous scene:
"Jo: Rice:" took the part.

[161] In the MS. _Vandermitten_ is scored through, and _Grotius_ written
above; but the alteration is not followed afterwards.

[162] "R.T." was responsible for the part.

[163] In the right-hand margin are the initials "T.P.," i.e. Thomas
Pollard.

[164] In the right hand margin is a stage-direction, scored through,--
"Droms--Enter ye Arminians: pass over."

[165] MS. _Enter Bredero, Vandort_ and 2 Lords. The words in Roman
letters are scored through in the MS.

[166] The brackets are mine: whoever excluded the 2 _Lords_ left these
words standing by an oversight.

[167] These weak endings without a pause are characteristic of
Massinger.

[168] Massinger is fond of the use of parentheses.

[169] In the MS. _Leiden_ has been corrected into _Roterdam_.

[170] The officer was personated by "R.T."

[171] In the right-hand margin we find "Mr. Rice."

[172] The Captains' parts were taken by "Mr. Rob." and "Mighel."

[173] The Dutch word _knol_ signifies both a turnip and a blockhead.

[174] i.e. explain to me. (A very common expression.)

[175] "Fry" has here the unusual sense of "buzz, hiss."

[176] In the right-hand margin we find "Cap. Jo: R."

[177] Underneath is written Migh. who took the part of 1 _Huntsman_.

[178] "And bycause some Hares by haunting the lowe watrie places do
become foule and mesled, such Hares doe never follow the hard ways nor
make such pathes to their formes, but use all their subtleties and
pollecies by the sides of the Ryvers, brookes and other waters."
Turberville's _Booke of Hunting_ (1575), p. 160.

[179] "R.T." took the part.

[180] MS. they.

[181] "Tho: Po:" (i.e. Thomas Pollard) is written in the right-hand
margin.

[182] MS. Potents.

[183] The part was taken by "G. Lowen."

[184] The Wife's part was taken by "Nich", who may possibly be (as Mr.
Fleay suggests) Nicholas Tooley; but I suspect that a younger actor than
Tooley would have been chosen for the part.

[185] "Jo: Rice" took the part.

[186] A corruption of Dutch _kermis_ (the annual fair).

[187] An ironical expression (very common) of denial or astonishment.

[188] _Sc_. merrily (Dutch _lustig_), "Lustick, as the Dutchman says."
--_All's Well_, II. 3.

[189] A corruption of Dutch _brui_. The meaning is "A plague on his
Excellencie!"

[190] In the MS. follow two and a half lines, spoken by _Vandort_, and a
speech of _Barnavelt's_, twenty-four lines long. These were cancelled on
revision. I have succeeded in reading some of the lines; and perhaps
after a keener scrutiny the whole passage might become legible. But I
have no doubt that the lines were cancelled by the author himself
(Massinger?) in order to shorten the scene.

[191] Nearly forty lines of dialogue that follow are cancelled in the
MS., in order to shorten the scene.

[192] Not marked in MS.

[193] This passage is marked in pencil, as for omission, in the MS.

[194] The words "Upon my soule" are crossed through in the MS.

[195] This line and the eleven lines following are marked for omission
in the MS.

[196] The words "tooke that course That now is practisd on you" are
crossed through in the MS., and "cutt of his opposites" substituted in
the right-hand margin.

[197] In the MS. the words "you can apply this" are crossed through.

[198] The words "to a Monarchie" are corrected in the MS. "to another
forme."

[199] Not marked in MS.

[200] Not marked in MS.

[201] T[homas] Holc[ombe] took the part.

[202] "Mr. Rob." took the part.

[203] In the right-hand margin we find the actor's name, "Mr. Bir.,"
i.e. Bir[ch].

[204] "The quantity of ten of any commodity; as a _dicker_ of hides was
ten hides, a _dicker_ of iron ten bars. See 'Fragment. Antiq.,' p. 192.
Probably from _decas_, Lat."--Nares.

[205] Sc. pumpkin (Fr.).

[206] "Dewse-ace. _Deux et az_." Cotgrave. (Cf. _Love's Labour's Lost_,
I. 2.) The lowest cast of the dice, two aces, was called "ames ace."

[207] Among the Romans the highest cast was called _Venus_ and the
lowest _canis_. (Cf. a well-known couplet of Propertius, lib. iv. el.
viii. l. 45--

    "Me quoque per talos Venerem quaerente secundos
    Semper damnosi subsiluere canes.")

[208] Sc. quatre et trois.

[209] Embroidered, figured.

[210] The actors' names, "Mr. Rob." and "Mr. Rice," are written in the
right-hand margin.

[211] A term of contempt, like "poor John."

[212] To set up one's rest, meant, as has been abundantly shown by
Shakespearean commentators, to stand upon one's cards at _primero_; but
the word "pull" in this connexion is not at all easy to explain. The
general sense of the present passage is plain: "Is my life held in such
paltry esteem that slaves are allowed to gamble for it as for a stake at
cards?" We have nowhere a plain account of _primero_. When the "Compleat
Gamester" was published (in 1674) the game had been discontinued. The
variety of quotations given by Nares, under _Primero_ and _Rest_, is
simply distracting. There are two passages (apud Nares) of Fletcher's
bearing on the present difficulty:--

    "My _rest is up_, wench, and I _pull_ for that
    Will make me ever famous."    _Woman's Prize_, I. 2.

    "Faith, sir, my _rest is up_,
    And what I now _pull_ shall no more afflict me
    Than if I play'd at span-counter."    _Monsieur Thomas_, IV. 9.

Dyce accepts Nares' suggestion that _pull_ means to _draw a card_; but
if a player is standing on his cards, why should he want to draw a card?
There is an old expression, to "pull down a side," i.e. to ruin one's
partner (by bad play); and I am inclined to think that to "pull at a
rest" in _primero_ meant to try to pull down (beat, go beyond) the
player who was standing on his cards. The first player might say, "My
rest is up"; the other players might either discard or say, "See it";
then the first player would either "revie" it (cover with a larger sum)
or throw up his cards. At length--for some limitation would have been
agreed upon--the challenger would play his cards, and the opponents
would "pull at his rest"--try to break down his hand. I am not at all
sure that this is the proper explanation; but _pull_ in the text cannot
possibly mean _draw a card_.

[213] The body of Leydenberg was not exposed until two days after
Barneveld's execution.

[214] Charles I. was particularly anxious that these trained bands
should be made as efficient as possible, In the "Analytical Index to the
Series of Records known as the Remembrancia" (printed for the
Corporation of the City of London, 1878) there are several letters from
the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor on this subject (pp. 533-9).
The Directions sent round to the Lord Lieutenants (An. 1638) concerning
the Trained Bands of the several counties are given in Rushworth's
_Historical Collections_, Part 2, vol. i. p. 790.

[215] An allusion, of course, to Bardolph's famous definition of
"accommodated" (2 _Henry IV_., iii. 2).

[216] _Fox_ was a cant term for a sword of English make. At Hounslow
Heath there was a sword-blade manufactory:--"Nov 30 (1639). Benjamin
Stone, blade maker, Hounslow Heath, to the Officers of the Ordnance.
Will always be ready to deliver 1,000 swords of all fashions every month
throughout the year, and will put in such security as the office shall
desire. Has now ready at the Tower and in his own house 2,000 swords to
deliver when the officers shall please."--Calendar of State Papers,
Domestic Series, 1639-40, p. 134.

[217] _Ticktacks_ was a game somewhat similar to backgammon. It is
described in the _Compleat Gamester_, 1674.

[218] The Pacification of Berwick took place in June, 1639.

[219] Tobacco-pipefuls; but no doubt a pun was intended. For _Bermudas_
tobacco Nares quotes from _Clitus's Whimz_., p. 135, "Where being
furnished with tinder, match, and a portion of decayed _Bermoodus_ they
smoke it most terribly."

[220] Our forefathers esteemed the March brewing; we the October.

[221] To "build a sconce" means, I suppose, to fix a candle in a
candle-stick.

[222] This speech of Sir Richard's is very much in Shirley's style:
cf. _Lady of Pleasure_ (I. 1).

[223] Galley-foist was the name given to long many-oared barges,
particularly the Lord Mayor's barge of state. Foist is also a term for a
sharper; and gallifoist was intended to be pronounced here gullifoist.

[224] An account of the way to play _Gleek_ is given in the _Compleat
Gamester_, 1674.

[225] Ambergrease was not uncommonly used for culinary purposes.

[226] Father-in-law is often used by old writers for step-father.
Perhaps "by a" is a correction for "to a."

[227] Title, mark of distinction (Hamlet, I. 4, &c.).

[228] A head-covering worn by women. "A night-rail (for a woman) pignon,
pinon," Sherwood's Engl.-French Dict. 1650.

[229] To be "in the suds" was an expression for to be "in the dumps."

[230] Vid. Notes of the Commentators on _Henry V_., iii. 7 ("strait
trossers").

[231] Regals were a kind of small portable organ: vide Nares.

[232] Cf. a passage in Shirley's _Witty Fair One_ (IV. 2): "What makes
so many scholars then come from Oxford or Cambridge like market-women
with dorsers full of lamentable tragedies and ridiculous comedies which
they might here vent to the players, but they will take no money for
them?"

[233] The Theorbo was a kind of lute.

[234] On June 20, 1632, a royal proclamation was made "commanding the
Gentry to keep their Residence in at their Mansions in the Country, and
forbidding them to make their habitations in London and places
adjoining." The text of the proclamation is in Rushworth's Historical
Collections (1680), Pt. II. vol. i. p. 144. In a very interesting little
volume of unpublished poems, temp. Charles I. (MS. 15,228, British
Museum), there is an "Oade by occasion of his Maiesties Proclamatyon for
Gentlemen to goe into the Country." It is too long to quote here in
full, but I will give a few stanzas:--

    Nor lett the Gentry grudge to goe
    Into the places where they grew,
    Butt thinke them blest they may doe so:
                Who would pursue

    The smoaky gloryes of the Towne,
    That might goe till his Native Earth
    And by the shineing fyre sitt downe
               Of his own hearth;

    Free from the gripeing Scriv'ners bands
    And the more biteing Mercers bookes,
    Free from the bayte of oyled hands
               And painted lookes?

    The Country, too, eene chops for rayne:
    You that exhale it by your pow'r,
    Let the fatt drops fall downe again
               In a full show'r.

    And you, bright beautyes of the time,
    That spend your selves here in a blaze,
    Fixe to your Orbe and proper Clime
               Your wandring Rayes.

    Lett no dark corner of the Land
    Bee unimbellisht with one Gemme,
    And those which here too thick doe stand
              Sprinkle on them.

    And, trust mee, Ladyes, you will find
    In that sweet life more sollid joyes,
    More true contentment to the minde,
              Then all Towne-Toyes.

    Nor Cupid there less blood doth spill,
    Butt heads his shafts with chaster love,
    Not feath'red with a Sparrow's quill
              Butt of a Dove.

    There may you heare the Nightingale,
    The harmeless Syren of the wood,
    How prettily shee tells a tale
              Of rape and blood.

    Plant trees you may and see them shoot
    Up with your Children, to bee serv'd
    To your cleane Board, and the fayr'st fruite
              To bee preserved;

    And learne to use their sev'rall gumms.
    Tis innocente in the sweet blood
    Of Cherrys, Apricocks and Plumms
              To bee imbru'd.

[235] The Galliard, a lively French dance described in Sir John Davies'
_Orchestra_ (st. 67).

[236] Sc. good-bye. Cf. Shirley's _Constant Maid_, i. 1, "Buoy, _Close_,
buoy, honest _Close_: we are blanks, blanks."

[237] Can the reference be to _Troilus and Cressida_?

[238] Ben Jonson's _Alchemist_.

[239] Puisne (i.e. puny) was the term applied to students at the Inns of
Court; also to Freshmen at Oxford.

[240] Cf. Shirley's _Honoria and Mammon_, i. 2:

    "Go to your Lindabrides
    I'the new brothel; she's a handsome _leveret_."

[241] The first edition of this well-known book was published in 1628.
_Parsons Resolutions_ is a fictitious book.

[242] The "lamentable ballad of the Lady's Fall" has been reprinted by
Ritson and Percy.

[243] In the MS. follows a line, scored through:--

    "And while my footman plaies sigh out my part."

[244] Shirley delights in ridiculing the affectation in which the
gallants of his time indulged. Cf. a very similar passage in _The Lady
of Pleasure_, v. 1.

[245] The cant language of thieves. In Harman's _Caveat for Cursitors_,
or some of Dekker's tracts, "Pedlars' French" may be found in abundance.

[246] I print this passage exactly as I find it in the MS. With a little
trouble it might be turned into good law.

[247] _Aut Shirley aut Diabolus_. Cf. _Duke's Mistress_, iv. 1:

    "You shall lead destiny in cords of silk,
    And it shall follow tame and to your pleasure."

[248] Sc. swaggering.

[249] A Chrisome child was one that died within a month after birth, at
the time of wearing the Chrisome cloth (i.e. the cloth formerly wrapt
round a child after baptism). Device implies that his rival is perfectly
helpless among ladies, a mere child.

[250] "In the City of London," says Nares, "young freemen who march at
the head of their proper companies on the lord mayor's day, sometimes
with flags, were called _whifflers_ or _bachelor whifflers_, not because
they cleared the way but because they went first as whifflers did.--'I
look'd the next Lord Mayor's day to see you o' the livery, or one of the
_bachelor_ whifflers. _City Match_.'"

[251] These words are scored through in the MS.

[252] To "bear a brain" means to have understanding. The expression is
very common.

[253] Not marked in the MS.

[254] The earliest reference I have yet found to the "Cup at
_Newmarket_" is in Shirley's _Hyde Park_, v. 1.

[255] The exact date of his death is unknown; he was dead before the
performance of Ben Jonson's _Bartholomew Fair_ (1614).

[256] "Merlin. The _falco aesalon_ of Linnaeus, a small species of hawk;
sometimes corrupted into murleon. It was chiefly used to fly at small
birds, and Latham says it was particularly appropriated to the service
of ladies."--Nares.

[257] Thomas Heywood gives an account of the "great ship" in his "True
description of his Majesties Royall Ship built this yeare 1637 at
Wool-witch in Kent," &c. 1637. 4to.

[258] "Back side" = back yard.

[259] A wild cat.

[260] This scene was added, as an afterthought, at the end of the MS. In
the body of the MS. we find only "_A song ith taverne. Enter Thomas_."

[261] The stage direction is my own.

[262] All that I know at present of Mr. Adson is that he published in
1621 a collection of "Courtly Masquing Ayres."
