  |   Politically it will be Democratic--red-hot and reliable    |
  |     earnest and continuous in its war against the bonded     |
  |  interest of the country, and determined in its labors for   |
  | that earnest Democracy, which believes in the _restoration_  |
  |       and not the _reconstruction_ of the Government.        |

  |   For one-hundred subscribers, with $200, a $100 machine.    |
  |                                                              |
  |                                                              |
  |                       IMPORTANT NOTICE                       |
  |                                                              |
  |   If you can not conveniently raise subscribers enough to    |
  |  entitle you to a machine, as a premium, send what you can,  |
  |    with two dollars for each subscriber so sent, and the     |
  |  balance in cash for such priced machine as you so desire,   |
  |   when the paper and the machine will be sent as directed.   |
  |                                                              |
  |  For example, where thirty subscribers and $60 are sent, it  |
  |   will require $26 in cash in addition to the subscription   |
  |  money to purchase a $56 machine; or, for forty subscribers  |
  |   and $80, sixteen dollars additional will be required to    |
  |   purchase the same priced machine, and son in proportion.   |
  |                                                              |
  | We offer these unrivalled machines, believing them to be the |
  |     simplest, most durable, useful, and desirable sewing     |
  | machines in the world, with a view to giving workingmen, or  |
  |  deserving woman a chance to obtain a machine for much less  |
  |            money than in any other possible way.             |
  |                                                              |
  |    There is hardly a township in the United States, but a    |
  |    person can, in a day or two, earn for himself a family    |
  | machine, actually worth the price asked for it--the same as  |
  | sold at, when purchased of Wilcox & Gibbs, the manufactures. |
  |                                                              |
  | In many cases a few gentlemen might, by sending their names  |
  |  to us as subscribers, receive for themselves THE DEMOCRAT   |
  |    each week, and a machine for some poor widow or other     |
  |    deserving woman, thus giving her the power to care for    |
  |          herself and family, and live independant.           |
  |                                                              |
  | Each machine we send out will be _perfect_, and of the very  |
  |                            best.                             |
  |                                                              |
  | Address all letters on business connected with the office to |
  |    C.P. Sykes, Publisher, P.O. Box 5,217, New-York City.     |
  |                                                              |
  |   Letters on political matters should be addressed to M.M.   |
  |  Pomeroy, and if the writer wishes them to be seen only by   |
  |  the person to whom they are address, they should be marked  |
  | private, when, if Mr. Pomeroy is not in the city, they will  |
  | be forwarded to him immediately by mail, express, or special |
  |                          messenger.                          |
  |                                                              |
  |     In ordering papers, be careful to write the names of     |
  |   subscribers with the post-office, county, and state very   |
  |  plain, that there may be no mistakes in entering names or   |
  |                      forwarding papers.                      |
  |                                                              |

  |                                                              |
  |        Additions can be made to clubs at $2 per year.        |

  | In forwarding sums of money for clubs of subscribers, drafts |
  |    or money orders should always be used, as, if lost or     |
  |  stolen, they can be duplicated, and no financial loss will  |
  |           be sustained by the parties interested.            |
  |                                                              |
