_The Camp in Bulstrode Park_.--Is there any published account of
this camp having been opened? It is well worth the examination of
a competent antiquary.... It is not even alluded to in Mr. Jesse's
_Favourite Haunts_, nor does that gentleman appear to have visited the
interesting village of "Hedgerley" (anciently _Hugely_), or Jordans,
the Quakers' Meeting-house, and burial-place of Penn, between
Beaconsfield and Chalfont. Chalfont was anciently written Chalfhunt,
and is by the natives still called Charffunt; and Hunt is a very
common surname in this parish: there was, however, Tobias Chalfont,
Rector of Giston, who died 1631. "Chal" appears to be a common prefix.
In Chalfont (St. Peter's) is an inscription to _Sir_ Robert Hamson,
Vycar, alluded to in Boutell's _Brasses_. In a cupboard under the
gallery staircase is a copper helmet, which, prior to the church
having been beautified in 1822, was suspended on an iron bracket with
a _bit of rag_, as it then looked, to the best of my memory. I have
heard that it belonged to the family of Gould of Oak End, extinct.

DR. PERCY AND THE POEMS OF THE EARL OF SURREY.

I have the means of showing what Dr. Percy did with the poems of the
Earl of Surrey, because I have a copy of the work now before me.

It can hardly be said that he "prepared an edition" of those poems,
as supposed by your correspondent "G." on the authority of Watts's
_Bibliotheca Britannica_, but he made an exact reprint of the _Songes
and Sonnettes written by the Right Honorable Lorde Henry Haward,
late Earle of Surrey, and other_, which was printed _Apud Richardum
Tottell. Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum_. 1557. The Bishop of
Dromere made no attempt at editing the work much beyond what was
necessary to secure an exact reimpression. He prefixed no Life of
Surrey (a point "G." wishes to ascertain); and, in fact, the book was
never completed. It contains considerably more than the reprint of the
poems of Lord Surrey, and was intended to consist of two volumes with
separate pagination; the first volume extending to p. 272., and the
second to p. 342.

As the work is a rarity, owing to an unfortunate accident, some of
your readers may like to see a brief notice of it. Watts (as quoted
by "G." for I have not his portly volumes at hand,) states that the
"whole impression" was "consumed in the fire which took place in Mr.
Nicholls's premises in 1808." This was a mistake, as my extant copy
establishes; and _Restituta_ (iii. 451.) informs us that _four_ were
saved. Of the history of my own impression I know nothing beyond the
fact, that I paid a very high price for it some twenty years since,
at an auction; but the late Mr. Grenville had another copy, which I
had an opportunity of seeing, and which had belonged to T. Park, and
had been sent to him by Dr. Percy for the advantage of his notes and
remarks. This, I presume, is now in the British Museum; whither it
came with the rest of Mr. Grenville's books, four or five years ago.

The "Songs and Sonnets" of Surrey occupy only the first forty pages of
vol. i.; then follow "Songs and sonnets" by Sir Thomas Wyat to p. 111.
inclusive; and they are succeeded by poems "of uncertain authors,"
which occupy the rest of the the first volume. The second volume
begins with "The Seconde Boke of Virgiles Ænæis," filling thirty
pages; while "the Fourth Boke" ends at p. 57., with the imprint of R.
Tottell, and the date of 1557. "Ecclesiastes and Certain Psalms by
by Henry Earl of Surrey," which are "from ancient MSS. never before
imprinted," close at p. 81. "Certayne Psalmes chosen out of the
Psalter of David," consisting of the seven penitential psalms, with
the imprint of Thomas Raynald and John Harrington," fill thirty pages;
and to them is added "Sir Thomas Wyat's Defence," from the Strawberry
Hill edition; which, with a few appended notes, carries the work on to
p. 141.

A new title-page, at which we now arrive, shows us the intention of
Dr. Percy, and the object at which he had all along aimed: it runs
thus:--"Poems in Bland Verse (not Dramatique) prior to Milton's
_Paradise Lost._ Subsequent to Lord Surrey's in this Volume, and to
N.G.'s in the preceding." In truth, Dr. Percy was making a collection
in the two volumes of all the English undramatic blank verse he could
discover, prior to the publication of Milton's great poem. He was
guilty of some important omissions, because bibliographical knowledge
was not then as far advanced as at present, but he performed good
service to letters as far as he was able to go; and the blank verse
productions he subjoins are by George Tubervile, George Gascoigne,
Barnabie Riche, George Peele, James Aske, William Vallans, Nicholas
Breton, George Chapman, and Christopher Marlow. These occupy from p.
342. of vol. ii.

This list might now be considerably increased; but my present business
is only to answer the Query of "G.," as to the nature and contents
of the work. It has been said, I know not on what authority, that
Steevens assisted Percy in preparing and printing it. I apprehend that
the aid given by Steevens consisted solely in recommending the Bishop
to procure certain rare productions which would contribute to the
purpose.

    [To this we may add, that about 1767, when Bishop Percy
    printed these twenty-five sheets of poems of Lord Surrey and
    the Duke of Buckingham, it appears by a letter of the Bishop
    to Horace Walpole, that he presented a copy of them to
    Walpole, with a request for information about Lord Surrey. The
    Bishop never wrote the Life of Surrey; and in 1808 the whole
    impression was burnt, with the exception of a copy or two that
    the Bishop had given to his friends. In the letter to Walpole
    the Bishop says, "A few more leaves will complete that book,
    which with the second and Dr. Surrey's Songs and Sonnets, &c.
    will be sufficient for the book."]

SYMBOLS OF THE FOUR EVANGELISTS.

Horne, in his _Introduction_, vol. iv. p. 254., says that Irenæus was
the first to discover the analogy between the four animals mentioned
by Ezekiel (i. 5. 10.) and the four Evangelists, which gave rise to
the well-known paintings of these latter. He quotes from _Iren. adv.
Hoer._ lib. iii. cap. 11.:--

    "The first living creature, which is like a lion, signifies
    Christ's efficacy, principality, and regality, viz. John; the
    second, like a calf, denotes His sacerdotal order, viz. Luke;
    the third, having as it were, a man's face, describes His
    coming in the flesh as man, viz. Matthew; and the fourth, like
    a flying eagle, manifests the grace of the Spirit flying into
    the Church, viz. Mark."
There is also an interesting passage in _Dionys Carthus. in Apocal.
Enarr._ iv. 7., from which the following is an extract:--

    "Although the above exposition of Gregorius, in which by the
    man in meant Matthew, by the calf Luke, &c., be the common
    one, yet other holy men have held a different opinion, for as
    Bede relates on this point, Augustine understood by the lion
    Matthew, because in the beginning of his Gospel he describes
    the _royal_ descent of Christ; by the calf he also understood
    Luke, because he wrote of the _priestly_ descent of Our Lord;
    by the man Mark, because he omits the question of Christ's
    birth, and confines himself more especially to describing
    His acts as a _man_; by the eagle, _all_ understand John, on
    account of the sublimity to which his Gospel soars. Others
    again understand by the lion Matthew; by the calf Mark,
    on account of the simplicity of his style; and by the man
    Luke, because he has more fully treated of Christ's _human_
    generation."

Would "JARLZBERG" kindly favour me with a reference to his interesting
anecdote of the lion's whelps?

Your correspondent "JARLZBERG" (No. 24. p. 385.) inquires for the
origin of the Evangelistic symbols. The four living creatures, in
Ezekiel, i. 10., and Revelations, iv. 7., were interpreted from
the earliest times to represent the four Gospels. Why the angel is
attributed to St. Matthew, the lion to St. Mark, and so on, is another
question: but their order in Ezekiel corresponds with the order of
the Gospels as we have them. Durandus would probably furnish some
information. The fabulous legend of the lion savours of a later
origin. Some valuable remarks on the subject, and a list of references
to early writers, will be found in Dr. Wordsworth's _Lectures on the
Canon of Scripture_ (Lect. VI. p. 151.), and his _Lectures on the
Apocalypse_ (Lect. IV. pp. 116, 117.)

      "Quatuor hæc Dominum signant animalia Christum,
      Est _Homo_ nascendo, _Vitulus_que sacer moriendo,
      Et _Leo_ surgendo, coelos _Aquila_ que petendo;
      Nec minus hos scribas animalia et ipsa figurant."]

       *       *       *       *       *

COMPLEXION.

_Complexion_ is usually (and I think universally) employed to express
the _tint of the skin_; and the hair and eyes are spoken of separately
when the occasion demands a specific reference to them. "NEMO"
(No. 22. p. 352.), moreover, seems to confound the terms "white"
and "fair," between the meanings of which there is considerable
difference. A white skin is not fair, nor a fair skin white. There
is no close approach of one to the other; and indeed we never see a
white complexion, except the chalked faces in a Christmas of Easter
Pantomime, or in front of Richardson's booth at Greenwich or Charlton
Fair. A contemplation of these would tell us what the "human face
divine" would become, were we any of us truly _white-skinned_.

The skin diverges in tint from the white, in one direction towards the
yellow, and in another towards the red or pink; whilst sometimes we
witness a seeming tinge of blue,--characteristic of asphyxia, cholera,
or some other disease. We often see a mixture of red and yellow (the
yellow predominating) in persons subject to bilious complaints; and
not unfrequently a mixture of all three, forming what the painters
call a "neutral tint," and which is more commonly called "an olive
complexion."

The negro skin is black; that is, it does not separate the sun's light
into the elementary colours. When, by the admixture of the coloured
races with the negro, we find coloured skins, they _always_ tend to
the yellow, as in the various mulatto shades of the West Indies, and
especially in the Southern States of America; and the same is true of
the "half-castes" of British India, though with a distinct darkness or
blackness, which the descendant of the negro does not generally show.

Though I have, in accordance with the usual language of philosophers,
spoken of _blue_ as an element in the colour of the skin, I have some
doubt whether it be a "true blue" or not. It is quite as likely
to arise from a partial participation in the quality of the negro
skin--that of absorbing a large portion of the light without any
analysis whatever. This may be called _darkness_.

However, to return to the Query: the term _pale_ is applied to the
yellow-tinted skin; _fair_, to the red or pink; _brown_, to the
mixture of red and yellow, with either blue or such darkness as
above described; _sallow_, to yellow and darkness; and the only close
approach to _whiteness_ that we ever see, is in the sick room of the
long-suffering fair complexion. In death, this changes to a "blackish
grey," a mixture of white and darkness.

The _pale_ complexion indicates a thick, hard, dry skin; the _fair_,
a thin and soft one; and all the shades of dark skin render a large
amount of ablution essential to health, comfort, or agreeableness
to others. If any of your readers should feel curious about the
characters of the wearers of these several skins, they must inquire of
Lavater and his disciples.

BALLAD OF DICK AND THE DEVIL.

Looking over some of your back numbers, I find (No. 11. p. 172.) an
inquiry concerning a ballad with this title. I have never met with it
in print, but remember some lines picked up in nursery days from an
old nurse who was a native of "the dales." These I think have probably
formed a part of this composition. The woman's name was curiously
enough Martha Kendal; and, in all probability, her forebears had
migrated from that place into Yorkshire:--

  "Robin a devil he sware a vow.
    He swore by the _sticks_[2] in hell--
  By the _yelding_ that crackles to mak the _low_[3],
    That warms his _namsack_[4] weel.

  "He _leaped_ on his beast, and he rode with heaste,
    To _mak_ his black oath good;
  'Twas the Lord's Day, and the folk did pray
    And the priest in _can_cel stood.

  "The door was wide, and in does he ride,
    In his clanking _gear_ so gay;
  A long keen brand he held in his hand,
    Our Dickon for to slay.

  "But Dickon goodhap he was not there,
    And Robin he rode in vain,
  And the men got up that were kneeling in prayer,
    To take him by might and main.

  "Rob swung his sword, his steed he spurred,
    He plunged right through the thr_a_ng.
  But the stout smith Jock, with his old mother's _crutch_[5],
    He gave him a _woundy_ bang.

  "So hard he smote the iron pot,
    It came down plume and all;
  Then with bare head away Robin sped,
    And himself was _fit_ to fall.

  "Robin a devil he _way'd_[6] him home,
    And if for his foes he seek,
  I think that again he will not come
    To _late_[7] them in Kendal kirk."[8]

Y.A.C.

    [2] The unlettered bard has probably confused "styx" with the
    kindling, "yelding," of hell-fire.

    [3] Flame.

    [4] I have often wondered what namsac (so pronounced) could
    be, but since I have seen the story as told by "H.J.M." it is
    evidently "namesake."

    [5] Probably crook in the original, to rhyme with Jock.

    [6] "I way'd me" is yet used in parts of Yorkshire for "I went."

    [7] "To late" is "to seek;" from _lateo_, as if by a confusion
    of hiding and seeking.]

    [8] "Kirk" is not a very good rhyme to "seek;" perhaps it should
    be "search" and "church".]

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.

_Cavell_.--In the time of Charles I., a large tract of land lying
south-eastward of Doncaster, called Hatfield Chace, was undertaken to
be drained and made fit for tillage and pasture by one Sir Cornelius
Vermuyden, a celebrated Flemish engineer of that day, and his
partners, or "participants," in the scheme, all or most of them
Dutchmen. The lands drained were said to be "_cavelled and allotted_"
to so and so, and the pieces of land were called "_cavells_." They
were "scottled," or made subject to a tax or assessment for drainage
purposes. Two eminent topographical writers of the present day are
inclined to be of opinion that this word _cavell_ is connected with
the Saxon _gafol_, gavel-tributum--money paid--which we have in
_gavel-kind_ and _gavelage_. One of them, however, suggests that the
word _may_ be only a term used in Holland as applicable to land, and
then introduced by the Dutch at the time of the drainage in question.
I shall be obliged if any of your readers can inform me if the word
"cavell" is so used in Holland, or elsewhere, either as denoting
any particular quantity of land, or land laid under any tax, or
_tributum_, or otherwise.

J.

    [Our correspondent will find, on referring to Kilian's
    _Dictionarium Teutonico-Latino-Gallicum_, that the word
    _Kavel_ is used for sors, "sors in divisione bonorum:" and
    among other definitions of the verb _Kavelen_, "sorte dividere
    terram," which corresponds exactly with his _cavelled and
    allotted_.]

_good-tide_, i.e. holiday or festival? In Halliwell's _Archæological
Dictionary_ I find,--

    "Good-day, a holiday; Staff.

    Tuesday.

_Salt ad Montem_ (No. 24. p. 384.) _as meaning Money_.--_Salt_ is
an old metaphor for money, cash, pay; derived, says Arbuthnot, from
_salt's_ being part of the pay of the Roman soldiers; hence _salarium,
salary_, and the levying contributions at _Salt_ Hill. Your Querist

of Transplanting the Irish in Connaught Vindicated, from Col. R.

_Pimlico_ (No. 24. p. 383.).--The derivation of this word is explained

me, entitled _Newes from Hogsdon_, 1598:--

    "Have at thee, then, my merrie boyes, and hey for old _Ben
    Pimlico's_ nut-browne."

Pimlico kept a place of entertainment in or near Hoxton, and was
celebrated for his nut-brown ale. The place seems afterwards to have
been called by his name, and is constantly mentioned by our early
dramatists. In 1609 a tract was printed, entitled _Pimlyco, or Runne
Red Cap, 'tis a Mad World at Hogsdon_. Isaac Reed (Dodsley's _Old
Plays_, ed. Collier, vii. 51.) says,--

    "A place near Chelsea is still called Pimlico, and was
    resorted to within these few years, on the same account as the
    former at Hogsdon."

Pimlico is still, I believe, celebrated for its fine ale.

_Pimlico_ (No. 24. p. 383.).--I see, by a passage in Lord Orrery's

    Pemlicoe, Dublin." (_Earl of Orrery to Duke of Ormond_, Feb.
    5. 1663, in _Orrery's State Letters_.)


This may be of use to "R.H.," who inquires about the origin of
_Pimlico_. _Ranelaugh_, in the same parts, is doubtless also of Irish
origin.

"apeece" is larger than the price of the "chute." Twin lambs are still
called _bive_ lambs on the borders of Sussex and Kent; and chute lambs
are fat lambs.

_Chuet_ is an old word signifying a fat greasy pudding. It is rightly
applied to Falstaff:--

_Le Petit Albert_ (No. 24. p. 385.).--I suspect this Petit Albert,
in 32mo.--a size in harmony with the cognomen--is only a catchpenny
publication, to which the title of _Le Petit Albert_ has been given
by way of resembling its name to that of Albertus Magnus, who wrote a
work or works of a character which gave rise, in the middle ages, to
the accusation that he practised magical arts; and hence, probably,
any abridgement or compendium of them, or any little work on such
arts, would be styled by the French compiler _Le Petit Albert_. In
the _Biographie Universelle_, it is affirmed that the rhapsodies
known under the name of _Secrets du Petit Albert_ are not by Albertus
Magnus; a statement which favours the belief that the work mentioned
by your correspondent "JARLZBERG" is one of that vulgar class (like
our old Moore's Almanack, &c.) got up for sale among the superstitious
and the ignorant, and palmed on the world under the mask of a
celebrated name. According to Bayle, Albertus Magnus has, by
some, been termed _Le Petit Albert_, owing, it is said, to the
diminutiveness of his stature, which was on so small a scale, that
when he, on one occasion, paid his respects to the pope, the pontiff
supposed he was still kneeling at his feet after he had risen up and
was standing erect.
