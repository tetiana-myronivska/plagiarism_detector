ANNUAL MEETING.
---------------


The next annual meeting of the American Missionary Association will be
held in Northampton, Mass., in the Edwards Church, commencing at three
o'clock Tuesday afternoon, October 21st. Rev. Frank W. Gunsaulus, D.D., of
Chicago, Ill., will preach the sermon. On the last page of the cover will
be found directions as to membership and other items of interest. Fuller
details regarding the reception of delegates and their entertainment,
together with rates at hotels and railroad reductions, will be given in
the religious press. A meeting of unusual interest is expected, and we
hope our friends will be present in full attendance.

For notice of Woman's Meeting, see page 318.

The holding of our Annual Meeting in Northampton will call up some very
remarkable associations. Northampton was the home of Jonathan Edwards,
who was not only the eloquent preacher and profound theologian, but the
missionary to the neighboring Stockbridge Indians. It was also the home
of his son-in-law, David Brainerd, who was the typical self-denying
martyr-missionary to the Indians in New Jersey. It was the home of the
Tappan family, two of whose sons, Arthur and Lewis, were among the early
founders and most valued friends of this Association. In June, 1848, the
Tappan family held a joyous family reunion in Northampton, continuing
for a week.

Frederick Douglass is hopeful. In a recent address he says: "A great
change has taken place among the colored race--vast and wonderful has it
been. It seems as if we had realized the vision of St. John when he saw a
new heaven and a new earth. But the change has come at last. The time has
come when we can look our fellow-citizens in the face and share in the
glory of the country."

No man has a better right to say this than he, for his life has touched
the degraded condition of the slave and the exalted position of an
Embassador of this great Republic. He adds: "Some talk of exterminating
our race, and others say we will soon die out, but I tell you both are
impossible. If slavery could not kill us, liberty won't." Liberty ought
to do more than save them alive. It ought to educate, elevate and
Christianize them.

The _Independent_ quotes from Dr. Mayo's address before the American
Social Science Association on "The Third Estate," in which the Doctor,
refers to the strange population of the great Southern mountain
world--nearly two millions at present--as a body of people that sends
forth a louder cry for the missionary of modern civilization than any
other portion of the Republic, and adds:


      "What is also said by the Unitarian, Dr. Mayo, of the need of
      missionary work for this class of the Southern whites, calls
      for an emphasis even stronger than we could put on any
      political conclusion. We pass this patriotic appeal along to
      those who have the wealth that is seeking a worthy object on
      which to expend itself. There are missionary societies whose
      business it is to do this. For the Congregationalista, the
      American Missionary Association will for a very moderate
      amount establish a church and an academy in any one of a
      hundred counties inhabited by these people, and what a man
      with a million dollars to expend could do we hardly dare to
      say. For the Presbyterians, the Board of Home Missions will do
      the same; for the Methodists, their Missionary Society; for
      the Episcopalians, their board of Domestic Missions; for the
      Baptists, their Home Mission Society; and so on for all the
      religious bodies. But will not a goodly company of wealthy men
      supplement what the churches are doing in their collections,
      by large gifts for this special, most needy, most fruitful,
      and we declare most neglected mission work of the nation?"

Agitations on the surface are significant mainly as they are connected
with the larger movements of the deeper waters beneath. The re-election of
Speaker Reed to Congress, and the contest for the re-election of Mr.
Breckinridge in Arkansas; the Federal Election Bill, which proposes to
secure a free ballot for all men irrespective of color, and the Convention
in Mississippi, which aimed avowedly to curtail the voting of the colored
people--all these derive their importance from their relation to the
gravest problem of American statesmanship. That problem will not be
settled by the results of either of these current questions. For at the
bottom the real question is: Shall knowledge and character and property
become the possession of the colored race, and they thus be prepared for
their place in American politics, industry and prosperity, or will they be
allowed for the lack of these things to be crushed back into a condition
of semi-slavery or be goaded to resistance or discouraged in poverty,
pauperism and degradation? That is a fundamental question. For that, men
should read, think, pray and work.


The Federal Election Bill And The Mississippi Convention.
---------------------------------------------------------


The ultimate aim of the Federal Election Bill in Congress, and of the
Constitutional Convention in Mississippi, point in diametrically opposite
directions. They cannot be harmonized, and there is no middle way between
them. The Election Bill contemplates a "free ballot and fair count" for
every voter, including the Negro. The Mississippi Convention aims to
restrict Negro suffrage. In an address delivered by the President of the
Convention, September 11th, he is reported to have said that: "He did not
propose to mince matters and hide behind a subterfuge, but if asked by
anybody if it was the purpose of the Convention to restrict Negro
suffrage, he would frankly say, 'Yes; that is what we are here for.'" This
Convention proposes to secure its object not by the force and fraud of
earlier days, but by constitutional and legal methods--or at least by what
has constitutional and legal _forms_. All this, however, is another
attempt to achieve the impracticable. As the Negro grows in intelligence
and numbers, he will claim his right to vote.
