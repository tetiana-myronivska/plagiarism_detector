     I am very much interested in the Cubans, and I hope that they will
     get free. I wish THE GREAT ROUND WORLD would tell more about it. We
     have your nice little book for our reading class. We all laughed
     right out when we read about the serpent down on the Florida coast,
     and the singing mouse. I will close now, wishing great success to
     THE GREAT ROUND WORLD.

     DEAR MR. EDITOR:

     Having read three of your GREAT ROUND WORLD books, I now let you
     know how I enjoyed them. I read many interesting things about the
     little island of Greece, and many other things. I read one book a
     day, and each week I send them to a friend in the country. She
     enjoys them very much.

                                Yours truly,
       NEW YORK, May 4th, 1897.        JESSIE B.G.


The Editor thanks Marie, Dallas S., and Jessie B.G. for their kindly and
pleasant letters.


     DEAR EDITOR:

     I take your GREAT ROUND WORLD and like it very much. I hope Greece
     will win in her war with Turkey, and Cuba in her war with Spain.
     General Weyler must be a very cruel man to kill the wounded Cuban
     soldiers who are in the hospitals. I hope the wars will soon stop
     and the countries be at peace. I enjoy your paper very much, it
     having many interesting accounts in it. I am very glad that the
     Czar of Russia is not going to make the exiles travel on foot any
     more to Siberia, and I think he must be a very nice ruler. Do you
     think the Cubans will win? I wish THE GREAT ROUND WORLD was
     published twice a week, as I like it so much. Did young Prince
     George of Greece marry that "Holy Child," as I think she is called?

                                         Yours truly,
EVANSVILLE, MD., May 12th, 1897.            NANNIE M.


DEAR NANNIE:

Thank you for your letter and kind words.

In regard to Prince George of Greece, our list of the reigning families
of Europe for 1897 states that he is unmarried.
