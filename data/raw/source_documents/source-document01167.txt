_Mireille_, Miss EAMES, charming throughout, is a happy peasant
in beautiful little patent leather shoes, which, I hope, are
as easy as apparently are her circumstances. She is beloved by
one _Vincent_, pronounced _Van Song_, a peasant of a rather
Whitechapelish-costermongerish-out-on-a-Sunday appearance, but
picturesque withal. They are engaged; at least, if they are not they
ought to be. Then comes a handsome elderly lady, disguised like a
fairy godmother in a pantomime before she throws off her hood and
announces her real character, and this lady, called _Taven_ in the
bill, is Mlle. PASSAMA, who sings a song about a _papillon_, for what
particular reason I do not know, except to please the audience, which
it did, being encored, and to puzzle _Mireille_, in which it also
succeeded, if I might judge by Miss EAMES's expressive countenance.
And here I must observe that I found my intimate acquaintance with
the French language almost useless, for except an occasional "_oui_,"
given, as _Jeames_ has it, "in excellent French," and for some
allusions to "_le papillon_" just mentioned, and "_et alors_"--which
didn't help me much, even when given twice most dramatically by M.
ISNARDON,--I couldn't catch a single word, and as far as libretto
went, it might have been, for me personally, given in double-Dutch,
or the dialect of a South-African tribe.

Toasting-cum-Tuning-Fork.]

On the disappearance of _Taven_,--[she didn't take off her cloak, and
wasn't a fairy, which rather put me off the scent, I admit,]--in comes
a gorgeous person, six feet high at least, and stout in proportion,
who, as I gathered from the programme, was _Ourrias_ (what a name!),
played by Signor CESTE, and sung with a kind of double vibrato stop in
his organ, which seemed, when turned on full, to make the upper boxes
quiver. Well, in he comes, and tells _Mireille_ something--what,
I don't know--but this is how the row began, as, in less than five
minutes, two old men, one M. ISNARDON, dramatic and in tune, and
the other, not mentioned in my programme, and therefore pardonably
somewhat out of tune, enter and commence a rumpus; what the difficulty
was all about I am not clear, but the upshot was that the old man in
tune cursed his daughter, and the old man out of tune held back his
son VINCENT, and prevented him from first assaulting and then being
assaulted by the irate _Maître Ramon_, i.e., M. ISNARDON. The Chorus
of Unhappy Villagers forms _tableau_. End of Act the Second; in Act
the First there was no action at all, and everything had gone off as
pleasantly as possible.

Then, in Act III., there is a sandy desert--where?--Egypt?--Heaven,
AUGUSTUS HARRIS, and the scene-painter, only know--and here comes on
a mighty illigant shepherd with a pipe--to play, not to smoke--and
one clever person near me was sure it was Miss EAMES in disguise, but
it turned out to be Miss REGINA PINKERT, a piper of whom some present
would willingly have paid to hear a little more; but she vanished,
probably in search of her flock in the desert,--by the way, an
excellent place for golf this desert,--and then in came _Mireille_ and
_Taven_, when the latter, I fancy, tells _Mireille_ of the crime she
has witnessed in the previous scene, which, I regret to say, I have
omitted to mention from motives of delicacy. But alas! I can no longer
conceal the fact. In that previous scene _Mr. Ourrias_ had behaved
very badly in first losing his temper, and then sticking a dagger into
poor _Vincent Lubert_, who fell down behind a rock, presumably dead.

The golf-ground is cleared off, and we are back again in front of the
village church. But at this moment a person, who knew all about it,
whispered, "If you want to get your cab, and escape the crush, now's
the time, as the Opera is just over." So I hurried off, and to this
moment I haven't the faintest idea how it all ended, and I don't quite
understand how it began. However, I have recorded my impressions,
confused probably, but--the music is very pretty, and Miss EAMES very
charming.

PARENTAL AUTHORITY.

_Typical British Father_ (_according to the Home Secretary_). Now,
come, JANE and JIM, bundle up to your work. Look sharp!

_Government Inspector_. No, Mr. SIKES, I think not. Your youngsters
have not touched eleven yet.

_Typical British Father_. But they're over ten.

_Government Inspector_. That don't matter. The age is altered. You'll
just send your young kids back to the Board School again.

_Typical British Father_. Well, I call it downright robbery. Why, they
supports me, they do; and what more fitter work can you find for the
kids, but to support their parients with the sweat of their brow. Why,
I thought the 'OME SECRETARY was all on our side.

_Government Inspector_. Well, he's been beat, that's all. The country
don't see the fun of sending children of tender years away from their
proper training, to wear out their young bodies and poison their young
systems in beastly close, ill-ventilated work-rooms, and all just to
bring in an extra bit of money to enable their parents, like you, to
laze and loaf at home, and, maybe, spend their hardly-earned wage on
drink. However, you'll have to dock it, Mr. SIKES.

_Typical British Father_. Well, I call it downright bloomin' robbery.
It's more. It's a invasion of the sacred rights of the British
working man's domestic home. It's a infringement of the liberty of the
subject, that's wot it is. It's a teaching the young 'uns rebellion
against their natural protectors. It's a bloomin' shame!

    [Government Inspector _leads them off delighted_. Typical
    British Father _left swearing_.

UNSELFISH HELP BY SMILES.--"Dr. QUAIN's advice to doctors," says
Mr. JAMES PAYN in the _Illustrated London News_, "always 'to look
cheerful,' ought to be written in letters of gold." So it is: in
notes, or cheques. When the eminent novelist has to send for Dr.
QUAIN, the latter will beam on him, and tell him a good story. The
labour he delights in will "physic PAYN."

POLITICAL ASIDES;

OR, TRUTH IN PARENTHESES.

(_VERY FREELY ADAPTED FROM_ THOMAS HOOD.)

_Fond Mother_. I really take it vastly kind,
     This visit, my dear creature!
    A family likeness here you'll find.
      (Like _hers_? Not in one feature!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Only too happy, I am sure,
      To see the little darling,
    Our family friendships _are_ so pure!
     (They find effect in snarling.)

_Fond Mother_. Well, dear, with _your_ experience,
      Your aid must be of value.
    You've not yet given its help immense.
     (Nor, if I know it, _shall_ you!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Ah! Good Nurse G-SCH-N, is she out,
      That you the babe are dandling?
    Sweet-tempered child and strong, no doubt!
      (The brat wants careful handling.)

_Fond Mother_. G-SCH-N and D-KE are both at hand,
      But I'm so proud to show it.
    The weakness _you_ will understand
     (Envious, and knows I know it!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Mothers must be as vigilant
      As--say 'Bus-strikers' pickets.
    It cries, dear! What does baby want?
      (Half-starved, and has the rickets!)
