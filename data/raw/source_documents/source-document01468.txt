Economy


Economy--overview: Since 1984 the government has accomplished
  major economic restructuring, moving an agrarian economy dependent
  on a concessionary British market access toward a more
  industrialized, free market economy that can compete globally. This
  dynamic growth has boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the
  technological capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained
  inflationary pressures. Inflation remains among the lowest in the
  industrial world. Per capita GDP has been moving up toward the
  levels of the big West European economies. New Zealand's heavy
  dependence on trade leaves its growth prospects vulnerable to
  economic performance in Asia, Europe, and the US. The slump in
  demand in Asian markets largely explains the slight drop in GDP in
  1998.
