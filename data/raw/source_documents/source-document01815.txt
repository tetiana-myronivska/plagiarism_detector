UNDERWOOD, LUCIUS MARCUS. Born at New Woodstock, N.Y., October 26, 1853.
Spent early life on a farm. Was graduated from Syracuse University in 1877.
After teaching several years in his alma mater and elsewhere, he became
Professor of Botany in Columbia University. He contributed numerous
articles to the _Torrey Bulletin_, _Fern Bulletin_, and other scientific
journals. His scholarly book, "Our Native Ferns and Their Allies,"
continued unexcelled through six editions. He died November 16, 1907.


DAVENPORT, GEO. EDWARD. Born in Boston, August 3, 1833. A promoter and
officer of the Middlesex Institute. An accurate and diligent student of the
ferns, his numerous articles were published in the _Fern Bulletin_, in the
_Torrey Bulletin_, _Rhodora_, and in separate monographs. He was a leading
authority on the pteridophyta, and collected a large and choice herbarium
of the native ferns, which he donated to the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society. By his gentle manners and kindly spirit he won many friends, all
of whom were proud to recognize his distinguished ability. He cultivated
many of our rare native ferns in his Fellsway home, at Medford, Mass., and
freely gave specimens to his friends. He died suddenly of heart failure,
November 29, 1907.


WATERS, CAMPBELL EASTER. Born in Baltimore County, Md., September 14, 1872.
Was graduated at Johns Hopkins University in 1895. Ph.D. in 1899. Was for
a time a close student of ferns, and issued his notable book, "Ferns," in
1903, containing his "Analytical Key Based on the Stipes." A chemist by
profession, he has pursued that branch of science for the last eighteen
years. His address is Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C.

MAXON, WILLIAM RALPH. Born at Oneida, N.Y., February 27, 1877. Was
graduated at Syracuse University in 1898. Began as aid in cryptogamic
botany, United States National Herbarium, 1899, and is now associate
curator of the same. Has specialized in scientific work on the
pteridophyta, distinguishing himself by the excellence as well as by the
large number of his publications, the more important being "Studies of
Tropical American Ferns," Nos. 1 to 6. The _Fern Bulletin_, _Torrey
Bulletin_, _American Fern Journal_, _Fernwort Papers_, et al., have
profited from his expert and up-to-date knowledge. He is president of the
American Fern Society.

PARSONS, FRANCES THEODORA. Born in New York, December 5, 1861. _Née_ Smith.
Married Commander William Starr Dana of the United States Navy, who was
lost at sea. As Mrs. Dana, she published, "How to Know the Wild Flowers,"
in 1893, and within ten years more than seventy thousand copies of the book
had been sold. "According to Season" appeared in 1894. In February, 1896,
she married Prof. James Russell Parsons, treasurer of the University of
the State of New York. In 1899 she published, "How to Know the Ferns." She
combined a thorough knowledge of her subject with an easy and graceful
style.

DODGE, RAYNAL. Born at Newburyport, Mass., September 9, 1844. Civil War
veteran. Wounded at Port Hudson, June 28, 1863. A machinist by trade. A
careful observer and student of nature, he discovered _Aspidium simulatum_
at Follymill, Seabrook, N.H., in 1880. (Whittier's "My Playmate," verse
9.) He discovered also the hybrid _Aspidium cristatum × Marginale_. He
published his little book, "Ferns and Fern Allies of New England," in 1896.
Died October 20, 1918.

EATON, ALVAH AUGUSTUS. Born at Seabrook, N.H., November 20, 1865. Studied
at the Putnam School in Newburyport, but was largely self-educated. He
took up teaching for several years, spending three years in California.
Returning East, he became a florist and began to write for various fern
journals, giving special attention to the fern allies. He prepared the
genera _Equisetum_ and _Isoetes_ for the seventh edition of "Gray's
Manual." He proved the keenness of his observing powers by discovering
several ferns new to the United States. Died at his home in North Easton,
Mass., September 29, 1908.

WILLIAMSON, JOHN. Born in Abernathy, Scotland, about the year 1838. He came
to Louisville, Ky., to live in 1866. A wood-carver by trade, he could work
skillfully in wood or metal, and after a time established a brass foundry.
His friend, George E. Davenport, writes of him: "He caught as by some
divine gift or inspiration the innermost life and feelings of the wild
flowers and ferns, and his marvelously accurate needle transfixed them with
revivifying power on paper or metal." His "Ferns of Kentucky," issued in
1878, was the first handbook on ferns published in the United States. He
died June 17, 1884, in the mountains of West Virginia, whither he had gone
for his health.
