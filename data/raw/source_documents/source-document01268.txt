_A Pretty Girl_ (_to Mr. ACKMEY, who has been privileged to take
charge of herself and her plain Sister_). Do come and tell me if I'm
doing it right, Mr. ACKMEY. You _said_ you'd go round with me!

_The Plain S._ How can you be so _selfish_, FLORRIE? You've had ever
so much more practice than _I_ have! Mr. ACKMEY, I wish you'd look
at my left boot--it _will_ go like that. Is it my ankle--or what? And
this strap _is_ hurting me so! Couldn't you loosen it, or take me back
to the man, or something? FLORRIE can get on quite well alone, can't
she?

_Mr. A._ (_temporising feebly_). Er--suppose I give _each_ of you a
hand, eh?

_The Plain S._ No; I can't go along fast, like you and LAURA. You
promised to look after me, and I'm perfectly helpless alone!

_The Pretty S._ Then, am I to go by myself, Mr. ACKMEY?

_Mr. A._ I--I think--just for a little, if you don't mind!

_The Pretty S._ Mind? Not a bit! There's CLARA WILLOUGHBY and her
brother on the next ring, I'll go over to them. Take good care of
ALICE, Mr. ACKMET. Good-bye for the present.

    [_She goes; ALICE doesn't think Mr. A. is "nearly so nice
    as he used to be."_

_The Reckless Rough_. Now then, I'm on 'ere. Clear the way, all
of yer! Parties must look out fur theirselves when they see _me_ a
comin', I carn't stop fur nobody!

    [_Rushes round the ring at a tremendous pace._

_An Admiring Sweeper_ (_following his movements with enthusiasm_).
Theer he goes--the Ornimental Skyter! Look at 'im a buzzin' round!
Lor, it's a treat to see 'im bowlin' 'em all over like a lot er
bloomin' ninepins! Go it, ole FRANKY, my son--don't you stop to
apollergise!... Ah, there he goes on his nut agen! _'E_ don't care,
not _'e_!... Orf he goes agin!... That's _another_ on 'em down, and
ole FRANKY atop--'e'll 'ave the ring all to isself presently! Up
agin! Oh, ain't he _lovely_! I never see his loike afore nowheres
... _Round_ yer go--that's the stoyle! My eyes, if he ain't upset
another--a lydy this time--she's done _'er_ skytin fur the d'y, any
'ow! and ole FRANK knocked silly ... Well, I ain't larfed ser much in
all my life! [_He is left laughing._

THE CURATE TO HIS SLIPPERS.

  Take, oh take those boots away
    That so nearly are out-worn;
  And those shoes remove, I pray--
    Pumps that but induce the corn;
  But my slippers bring again,
            Bring again--
  Works of love, but worked in vain,
            Worked in vain!

Our Own First-Class Clipper sends us the following from the
_Manchester Guardian_, Dec. 11th:--

    GROCERY.--Wanted, a live Sugar Wrapper. Apply, &c.

    SHOE TRADE.--Wanted, good Hand-sewn Men. Apply, &c.

    DRAPERY.--Wanted, for the first three weeks in January, several
    Men, for sale. Apply by letter, stating experience, &c., to ----.

Would a Spirit Rapper be accepted for the first? and a man who had got
a stitch in his side for the second? As for the third, there are so
many people sold at Christmas time, that to provide a few men for sale
would be no very difficult task.
