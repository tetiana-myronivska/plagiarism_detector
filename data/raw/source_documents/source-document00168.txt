@Benin:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output, which had averaged a sound 4% during
1990-95, rose to 5.5% in 1996 and was targeted at 4.8% for 1997. Rapid
population growth offset much of this growth in output. Inflation
jumped to 55% in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50%
currency devaluation in January 1994, but has subsided over the past
three years, with a target of 3.5% inflation in 1997. Commercial and
transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are extremely
vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly fuel shortages.
Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral creditors has eased
the external debt situation in recent years. The government, still
burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a bloated civil
service, has been gradually implementing a World Bank supported
structural adjustment program since 1991.

@Bermuda:Economy

Economy-overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes
in the world, having successfully exploited its location by providing
financial services for international firms and luxury tourist
facilities for 360,000 visitors annually. The tourist industry, which
accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84% of its business
from North America. The industrial sector is small, and agriculture is
severely limited by a lack of suitable land. About 80% of food needs
are imported. International business contributes over 60% of Bermuda's
economic output; a failed independence vote in late 1995 can be
partially attributed to Bermudian fears of scaring away foreign firms.
