_At the Sun-Tavern at Billingsgate, written on the Wainscot._

_Underwritten._

  Mr. Pimp, had I known your Worship was there,

_At the Red-Lion, Shrewsbury._

  The Drawer, _Tom_, has scarce forgot,
    Since I was here last _Easter_;
  I broke his Head with the Pewter Pot,
    And gave him not a Teaster.
  But why, d'ye think, I serv'd him so?
    What Flesh alive could bear it?
  I'd call'd a dozen Times, I trow,
    Yet the Dog would bring no Claret.
  This Discipline was not in vain,
    For h'as his Manners mended;
  I've been here twenty Times since then,
    And always well attended.


_From a Window in Carlisle, the Sign forgot._

  How says the Proverb, can it e'er be thought,

  For _Molly_ kind is kiss'd by none, but only all that know her.

_From another Pane in the same Place._

  As dear _N----y B----k_ look'd into the Street,

  I poop'd her behind, but no Body see't,
    And she prov'd ne'er the worse for my using.

  Ungrateful Wretch, thou'rt scarcely fit to live,

  A greater Curse than leading Apes in Hell,

_On the next Pane._

  Dear Madam, pray dont let your Anger abound,
    For Faith what you've wrote has no Charm in't;
  You often have try'd me, and know I am sound,
    Then prithee now where was the Harm in't?
  You did me a favour, I did you one too,
    And, if I'm not mistaken, a greater;
  I'll swear I can't love the Sport better than you,
    So pray say no more of the Matter.


_In a Bog-House, at the Bush at Carlisle_, 1718.

    Reader,

  For here I've s----, and likewise here have sh----d.
  They both are healthful, Nature's Ease require 'em
  And though you grin, I fancy you desire 'em.

  A sullen Faggot, wet and green,

  And she better had stay'd at Home.

As she lost nothing by it, she may still remain a Light to the World.

_Calais, at the Silver Lion._

  At the Foot of a Bed where a Woman lay dying,
    A Parcel of Gossips in Council were sat;
  And instead of good Prayers, condoling and crying,
    A _Thing_ was the Subject of all the Debate.
  One wish'd for a thick one, and swore 'twas the best,
    Altho' 'twere as short to the full as her Snout;
  But a small One procur'd the Applause of the rest,
    Provided in Length the Defect were made out.
  Hold, quoth the sick Sister, you are all in the Wrong,
    So I'll in a Case of this Weight to decide,
  Heav'n send me at once both the Thick and the Long;
    So closing her pious Petition, she dy'd.

_The Motto upon a Sign of a Gardiner's Window, who kept a Publick House
  in the Road to Cambridge; inserted for the Benefit of bad Spellers._

  Heer is good Liker
  Ov awl Quinds toby sould,
  And sevile Yewzitch.

The Learned have examin'd the above Inscription: Some took it for
Gibberish; others for _Welch_; and some for one of the Eastern
Languages; but a Gentlewoman of extraordinary Knowledge in this
cramp Way of Writing, tells us, it must be read thus, in _English_:

  Here is good Liquor
  Of all Kinds to be sold,
  And civil Usage.

And so we believe it was meant; for it is allow'd by all, that some few
of the fair Sex can explain bad Sense and bad Spelling, even better than
most of the Heads of the Universities.

most Places of publick Resort in this Kingdom, it is hoped that all, who

care how merry they are, provided they are not obscene.


THE

MERRY-THOUGHT.


PART IV.

To the EDITOR of the Glass-Window, _&c._ Miscellany.


_Mr._ BOG,

Where Wit and Learning (as at present in this our Isle) so much abound,
great Marvel it is to me, That so worthy a Compiler of other Men's
Labours as yourself, should be put to the little mean Shifts of copying
from such _Cacascriptores_, who have from _Hudibras_, _Tom Brown_, and
others of the like Rank, their little Bits and Scraps, basely purloined,
whereby you run a Risque of being deem'd yourself a Plagiary: Nor is it
less unbecoming the Dignity and Fidelity of your Undertaking, to supply
the Want of Application and Diligence, by filling up your lifeless Pages
with Musical Punctations, as vile and unrelishing as ever echo'd from
your own natural Bagpipe. Therefore, that you may the better be enabled
these Indecencies equally to avoid, I send you the following
_Collectanea Nasutula_: If you honour them, I shall honour your next
Performance; if not, _Non cuicunque datum est habere nasum_.


_From a Boghouse near _Lincoln's-Inn-Fields_._

_The_ WISH.

    Oh! may our Senate, learn'd and great,
    (In order to perpetuate
    The tuneful Strains and witty Flights,
    Of him that Studies while he sh - - ts)
    Decree all Landlords, thro' the Nation,
    Shall lay (on Pain of Flagellation)
    In some meet Corner of their Dark Hole
    A cuspidated Piece of Charcoal;
    Or, where the Walls are cas'd with Wainscot,
    A Piece of Chalk with equal Pains cut;
    That those who labour at both Ends,
    To ease themselves, and serve their Friends,
    May not, reluctant, go from Sh - - t,
    And leave no Relict of their Wit,
    For want of necessary Tools
    To impart the _Proles_ of their Stools:
    Then _Cibber_'s Odes, and _Tindal_'s Sense,
    _Caleb_ and _Henley_'s Eloquence,
    _Woolston_, and all such learned Sophi's,
    Would be cut down in House-of-Office:
    _Oxford_ and _Cambridge_ too would join
    Their Puns, to make the Boghouse shine
    Each learn'd Society would try all
    (From lowest Club, to that call'd Royal,)
    To furnish something might improve
    Religion, Politicks, or Love:
    Grand _Keyber_, Gormogons, Free Masons,
    And _Heydeger_, with all his gay Sons,
    Would find to suit, with Lectures there,
    Their Intellectuals to a Hair:
  _Bodens_ might pick up Wit from thence, and lay
  The _Drama_ of another Modish Play.
  So wise a Law would doubtless tend
  To prove our Senate, Learning's Friend;
  Whilst Trade, and such like fond Chimeras,
  Might wait more fit and leisure _Æra's._


_From a Window at the _Dolphin_ Inn in _Southampton_._

  The Wedding-Night past, says Sir _John_ to his Mate,
  Faith Madam I'm bit (tho' I find it too late)
  By your d - - - n'd little Mouth, or else I'm a Whore's Son,
  For the Cross underneath's quite out of Proportion.
  Good Sir _John_, says my Lady, then under the Rose,
  I'm as bad bit as you, by your plaguy long Nose:
  You have not by half so much as I wanted,
  I've more than you want, yet y'are not contented.


_From the Playhouse Boghouse._

  Good Folks, sh - - t and write, and mend honest Bog's Trade,
  For when you sh - - t Rhymes, you help him to Bread:
  He'el feed on a Jest, that is broke with your Wind,
  And fatten on what you here leave behind.


_From A Boghouse at the _White Hart_, Petersfield._

  Were this Place to be view'd by a Herald of Note,
  He would find a new Charge for the next new-bought Coat,
  Which _Guillim_ ne'er thought of, nor one of the Herd,
  _Viz._ a Wall erect Argent, _Gutte de T----d._
  And as a Reward, for improving the Art,
  He should bear on a Fess (if he paints it) a F - - - t.


_Underwritten._

  A Pox on your writing, I thought you were sh - - - - g,
    My great Gut has giv'n me such Twitches:
  Had you scribled much more, I'm a Son of a Whore,
    If I should not have don't in my Breeches.


_From the _White Lyon_, _Bristol_._

    I'm witty, I'll Write,
    I'm valiant, I'll Fight,
  And take all that's said in my own Sense:
    In Liquor I'm sunk,
    And confoundedly drunk,
  So there is the Source of this Nonsense.


_From the same Place._

  A Wretch, whom Fortune has been pleas'd to rowl
  From the Tip-top of her enchanted Bowl,
  Sate musing on his Fate, but could not guess,
  Nor give a Reason for her Fickleness:
  Such Thoughts as these would ne'er his Brain perplex,
  Did he but once reflect upon her Sex:
  For how could he expect, or hope to see,
  In Woman either Truth or Constancy.


_Written on the Wall of one of the Summer-Houses in _Gray's-Inn_ Walks,
  under a curious Piece of Drawing._

  Come hither, Heralds, view this Coat,
    'Twill bear Examination,
  'Tis ancient, and derives its Note
    From the first Pair's Creation.
  The Field is _Luna_, _Mars_ a Pale,
    Within an Orle of _Saturn_;
  Charg'd with two Pellets at the Tail:
    Pray take it for a Pattern.

_Under-written._

  I don't see your _Luna_, nor _Saturn_, nor _Mars_,
  But I see her ---- plain, and I see his bare A - - se.


_From another Place in the same Walks._

  Could fairest dear _Eliza_ know how much I love,
  My Story might, at least, her gen'rous Pity move;
  Her Pity's all my Hope, nor durst I more implore,
  With that I still might live, and still her Charms adore.

_Under-written._

  Poor Wretch, alas! I pity Thee with all my heart,
  Since that, it seems, alone will cure thy Love-sick Smart:
  For he that has not Courage further to implore,
  May surely have our Pity, but deserves no more.


_From a _Bog-House_ at the _George-Inn_ in _Whitchurch_._

  From costive Stools, and hide-bound Wit,
  From Bawdy Rhymes, and Hole besh - - t.
  From Walls besmear'd with stinking Ordure,
  By Swine who nee'r provide Bumfodder
      _Libera Nos_ ----


_Upon a Pillar at the _Royal-Exchange_._

  This City is a World that's full of Streets,
  And Death's the Market-Place where Mankind meets;
  If Life were Merchandize, that Men could buy,
  The Rich would only live, the Poor must die.


_In the Window of a _Green-House_ near _Tunbridge_._

  Sitting on yon Bank of Grass,
  With a blooming buxom Lass;
  Warm with Love, and with the Day,
  We to cool us went to play.
  Soon the _am'rous_ Fever fled,
  But left a worse _Fire_ in its Stead.
  Alas! that _Love_ should cause such Ills!
  As doom to _Diet-Drink_ and _Pills_.


_An Encomium on a _Fart_._
