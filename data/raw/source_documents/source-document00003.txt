MARVELS OF MAN'S MAKING.

I.--THE BROOKLYN SUSPENSION BRIDGE.


[Illustration]

When two large cities stand opposite to one another on the banks of a
river, it is not likely they can do very well without a bridge to
connect them. Yet the citizens of New York and Brooklyn were obliged to
manage as best they could for a good many years before they had their
bridge. There were many difficulties in the way. For one thing, the
river is very broad; for another, the tall-masted ships ply up and down
so frequently that it would never do to build anything which would
obstruct their passage; and to overcome these difficulties would mean
the expenditure of a vast sum of money. But the folk who earned their
daily bread in New York and lived in Brooklyn grew thoroughly tired of
spending chilly hours in foggy weather on the river-side piers, waiting
for the ferry-boat to come and take them across, and at last they began
an agitation which resulted in the Brooklyn Bridge.
