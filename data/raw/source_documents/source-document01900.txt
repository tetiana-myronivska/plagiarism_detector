THE PRIMÆVAL ANTIQUITIES OF DENMARK. By J.J.A. WORSAAE, M.R.S.A.,
of Copenhagen. Translated and applied to the Illustration of similar
Remains in England, by WILLIAM J. THOMS, ESQ., F.S.A., Secretary of
the Camden Society. Illustrated with numerous Woodcuts. 8vo. 10s. 6d.

    "This is the best antiquarian handbook we have ever met
    with--so clear is its arrangement, and so well and so plainly
    is each subject illustrated by well-executed engravings,
    that confusion for the future is impossible upon a variety of
    points on which the most grievous mistakes have hitherto been
    made by anxious and zealous antiquarians. * * * It is the
    joint production of two men who have already distinguished
    themselves as authors and antiquarians. It is a book of which
    it may be said, that in every sentence is to be found an
    interesting fact, and that every page teems with instruction,
    and may be regarded as a sure guide to all antiquarians in
    their future archæological inquiries."--_Morning Herald_.

THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND; from the TIME of the CONQUEST. By EDWARD FOSS,
F.S.A.

    "A work in which a subject of great historical importance is
    treated with the care, diligence, and learning it deserves;
    in which Mr. Foss has brought to light many points previously
    unknown, corrected many errors, and shown such ample knowledge
    of his subject as to conduct it successfully through all the
    intricacies of a difficult investigation, and such taste and
    judgment as will enable him to quit, when occasion requires,
    the dry details of a professional inquiry, and to impart
    to his work, as he proceeds, the grace and dignity of a
    philosophical history."--_Gent. Mag._

PINACOTHECÆ HISTORICÆ SPECIMEN; sive Illustrium Quorundam Ingenia,
Mores, Fortunæ, ad Inscriptionum formam Expressæ. Auctore F. KILVERT,
A.M. Pars Secunda.

    "The production of an English clergyman, and bears unequivocal
    marks of refined taste, elegant scholarship, and a
    liberal, generous, and candid mind. The idea--to us a novel
    one--carried out in this work is, to bring up for judgment
    (as the Egyptians used to do with their departed kings) the
    characters that figure most in the page of history, and to
    pass sentence upon them. Summoning them, as it were, into his
    presence with the lamp of history to guide him, _exquiritque
    auditque dolos_; and whether it be praise or blame, or a
    mixture of both, that he awards, the judgment is pronounced in
    a temperate spirit, and with judicial impartiality; and it
    is expressed in pure and elegant Latin, and often with
    epigrammatic felicity."--_Scotsman_.

THE ENGLISH GENTLEMAN: his Principles, his Feelings, his Manners, his
Pursuits.

    "We like him so well as to wish heartily we might meet many
    such."--_Theologian_.

    "The object of the first of the four essays is to form the
    principles of a gentleman on a Christian standard. In the
    other three subjects, of feelings, manners, and pursuits,
    the views, though strict, are of a more worldly
    kind."--_Spectator_.
