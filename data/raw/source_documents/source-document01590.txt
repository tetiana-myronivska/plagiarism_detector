Such being the case, it becomes more than ever desirable that this
interesting volume should be sought after, and the _whole_ of its
contents put on record before its total decay. Surely, if its depositary
is known, and accessible, it is well worth the attention of the
_Shakespeare Society_, or some other learned body instituted for the
preservation of documents of this nature.

A biographical account of the various persons that have held the
appointment of "Master of the Revels," with such particulars of the
stage as would necessarily fall in, would form a valuable _Prolegomena_
to the publication of Sir Henry's Office-Book. We have, it is true, much
information upon this subject, but in a very scattered form.

I have now before me a list of the "Masters of the Revells," with the
dates of their patents, which I beg to transcribe. It is of more than
ordinary value, being in the handwriting of Sir Henry Herbert himself,
and copied at the back of the worthy knight's "Petition to Charles the
Second against the Grant to Killegrew and Davenant to form Two Companies
of Players."

"_Masters of ye Revells_.

"Sir Richard Guilford    - not on record.
Sir Thomas Cawerden      - [1544] 36 Henry VIII.
Sir Thomas Beneger       - not on record.
Sir John Fortescue       - not on record.
Edmund Tilney, Esq.      - July 24 [1578] 21 Eliz.
Sir George Buck          - June 23 [1603] I Jac.
Sir John Astley          - [1612] 10 Jac. I.
Benjamin Johnson         - [1617] 15 Jac. I.

Simon Thelwall, Esq.  }  - Aug. 21 [1629] 5 Car. I."

NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS

It will be seen by our leading article that having been unable to
procure by any other means sufficient copies of our early numbers, to
supply perfect sets to all who applied for them, we have reprinted Nos.
1. 2. 3. and 4., so that our subscribers have now an opportunity of
completing their sets.

Our correspondent who inquired respecting the _Life and Diary of Haydon
the Painter_, is informed that its publication is suspended for the
present.

We have to explain to correspondents who inquire as to the mode of
procuring "NOTES AND QUERIES," that every bookseller and newsman will
supply it _if ordered_, and that gentlemen residing in the country may
be supplied regularly with the Stamped Edition, by giving their orders
direct to the publisher, MR. GEORGE BELL, 186. Fleet Street, accompanied
by a Post Office order for a Quarter (4s. 4d.).

A neat Case for holding Numbers of "NOTES AND QUERIES" until the
completion of each volume, is now ready, price 1s. 6d., and may be had,
by _Order_, of all Booksellers and Newsmen.

We are again compelled to omit many Notes, Queries, and Answers to
Queries, as well as Answers to Correspondents.
