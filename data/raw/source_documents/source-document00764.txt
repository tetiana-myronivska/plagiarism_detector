_Second W. I. M._ (_doggedly_). You're always talking about
agricultural depression and hard times for those that live on the
land, and you won't lift a finger to help them when you get the
chance. If we give these chaps Parish Councils, they can all get
allotments, and then of course (_quotes again_) "we shall multiply the
productive power of the land tenfold."

_First W. I. M._ What have allotments got to do with Parish Councils?

_Second W. I. M._ Everything.

_First W. I. M._ (_triumphant_). Then how do you account for my
Uncle's coachman having an allotment at this very moment? He's had it
for years, long before anybody even heard of Parish Councils.

_Second W. I. M._ That exactly proves my point. It's just because he
_isn't_ an agricultural labourer that he's been able to get it. What
we want to do is to level up.

_Inquirer._ But there aren't any agricultural labourers in my parish;
at least, I never heard of any. How are they going to manage about
that?

_Second W. I. M._ They'll send you some from somewhere else. That's
what they call migration.

_Inquirer._ I thought birds did that.

BEFORE THE PRIVATE VIEW.

(_A Modern Dialogue._)

[Illustration: Private View.]

SCENE--Lady HAY'S _Boudoir. Lady_ HAY _and_ Miss BEE _discovered
sipping five o'clock tea._

_Miss Bee_ (_sympathetically_). I am so sorry, dearest, that you have
sprained your ankle. And is it _quite_ out of the question to come on
Friday to Burlington House?

_Lady Hay._ Quite, dearest. Dr. KEELEY DODGE says I shall be laid up
the whole Season if I move a step before Monday. So you will tell me
all about the Royal Academy Private View, now won't you?

_Miss Bee._ Of course I will do my best; but you know my forte is not
description. What do you want to know?

_Lady Hay._ Why, of course, who were there, and what they said, and
(most important of all) what they wore. I hope, dear, you will notice
if they are wearing any of the new-fashioned bonnets, and if hats are
going out.

_Miss Bee._ You may rely upon me, darling.

_Lady Hay._ And mind you get at the last bit of scandal. There ought
to be plenty about, now that people have come back from the Riviera.
But, my dear, you know exactly what I should like, so it is useless to
prompt you. I leave everything to your discretion.

_Miss Bee._ Quite so, darling. (_After a pause._) I thought I had
forgotten something--how about the paintings?

_Lady Hay._ Oh, never mind them! They will keep until another
occasion!      [_And as they will, Scene closes in on the Pictures._

LIBERTY LOQUITUR.

    ["I am persuaded that the true interests of the entire
    working-classes of this country are bound up with respect for
    individual freedom, and that to overlook it, or to bring
    the smallest interference in restriction of it, unless under
    absolute necessity, would be a sad mistake upon the part of
    the working-classes."--_Mr. Gladstone to the Deputation of
    Miners from Durham and Northumberland._]

  I stand between you--Capital and Labour,--
    And each of you invokes my "sacred name."
  Sacred! Were love of freedom and one's neighbour
    Coöperant, claim would not conflict with claim.
  But heed my words, outspoken yet meant kindly;
  _I_ suffer whilst ye stone each other blindly.

  Solicitous--in speech--of my intactness,
    Ye damage and deface me in your strife.
  Your aims, expressed with full and fair exactness.
    Mean fratricidal strife, war to the knife.
  Encounter hot, and fierce retaliation
  Must vainly prate about conciliation.

  Union is strength; but banded for oppression
    Toilers are tyrants, and employers--knaves.
  Plain speech! Monopolist wealth in high possession
    Treated its scattered thralls as serfs and slaves.
  And now the lesson of the scourge and fetter
  Emancipated toil would learn--and better.

  Divide and govern! That, beneath all glosing
    About Free Labour, is Wealth's motto still;
  Ingenious fudge on shallow wits imposing,
    On banded Labour to impose its will,
  Capital needs (and lauds) Labour _unbanded_.
  The Many-headed dreads the Many-handed!

  But set one half his hands against the other,
    And e'en Briareus may be safely tackled.
  Whilst "Unionist" is foiled by "Blackleg" brother,
    Labour fights Capital with limbs half shackled.
  Hence Federations chant, in sweet communion,
  Hymns to the blessed Liberty of _non_-Union!

  And Labour, which loves Liberty--of striking,
    Hates "Blackleg" freedom with a furious hate.
  "_Make_ all men do according to _my_ liking!"
    Seems now the cry all round us in the State.
  Monopolist, Miner, Temperance fanatic,
  All crave compulsion with a force emphatic.

  But Legal Eight Hours Day, or Local Veto,
    "Blackleg" suppression, Anti-Union law,
  Mean "make the others to myself say ditto!"
    "Restriction" is the newest ass's-jaw
  For slaying all our foes, from Wealth to Drink,
  Hailed with applause, save by the few who think.

  If from proved ill to legal prohibition
    Were step as plain and proper as some deem,
  To diagnose (and cure) the State's condition
    Were easy as some Socialistic dream.
  But Looking Backward--or e'en forward--'s found
  Poor substitute for wisdom's look all round.

  Labour, you would be free to fix your wages;
    Capital, you'd be free to pick your men:
  Love of free Union the one's tongue engages,
    Love of free "Knobsticks" fires the other's pen;
  But love of Freedom for her own fair self,--
  How much of it moves Poverty or Pelf?

  Eight hours in the dark coal-seam, good friend Labour,
    Humanity admits more than enough.
  But _fix it so_, whilst neighbour wars' with neighbour,
    And mine with mine about it? Task too tough,
  Too desperate dilemma, for a Statesman,
  Why you can't settle it with your own mates, man!

  Capital, _does_ your passion for Toil's Freedom
    Mean much more than desire to smash Toil's Union?
  He sells his birthright for the mess of Edom,
    The "Blackleg" ESAU selling Work's communion
  Into the bonds of Wealth, well knit and strong,
  His comrades say. Are they entirely wrong?

  Thus Individual Freedom suffers scath
    On all sides. Can you plead Necessity's fiat?
  For _me_ you boast your love, proclaim your faith,
    But, battered by the missiles you let fly at
  Each other, I with ROLAND, cry in shame,
  What tyrannous things are done in Freedom's name!

FALBULOUS!

DR. FALB, of Vienna, knows when earthquakes and eruptions are going to
occur. Mr. MORLEY said, the other day, in the House of Commons, that
the best way of treating a prophet was not to believe him; but this
is rather difficult when the prophet happens to be right, as Dr. FALB
generally is. For example, he predicted the last terrible earthquake
at Zante, which only came one day before it was due. Dr. FALB has
been interviewed about how he does it,--or perhaps it would be
more appropriate to say, that he has been subjected to some mild
"Heckling"--and he appears to hold that it is the action of the Moon
on the tides which is responsible. In support of his theory it has
been noticed that it is quite a custom of the people at Zante, after
their houses have fallen in on their heads, to observe--"That was
a tidy shock!" These predictions should help them to tide over the
periods of danger.

COURT OUT!

[Illustration: One of the Points of the Piece. The Queen of the
Amazons gets the Needle.]

What is an "Original Farcical Romance"? The immediate reply is that
_The Amazons_, by Mr. PINERO, is a specimen of the genus. To see _The
Amazons_ ought to supply the terms of the required definition. I have
seen it, and yet the definition does not satisfy me. "_Original_"!
Well--more or less; but to use old materials in a novel manner is
quite enough for originality. The girl brought up as a boy is not
absolutely new or original, _vide_ _Tom Noddy's Secret_, and multiply
the heroine of that farce by three. The three men hunting after the
three girls and obtaining access to them at school--substituting, in
this case, home for school, and a mother for a school-mistress--is not
absolutely new or original; but, again, what matters this to anyone,
so long as the new shape given to the old material is genuinely
amusing? So "farcical" goes with "original." But now, as to its being
a "Romance?" Would not the term "burlesque" be a better term than
"Farcical Romance?" The characters of the three adventurous lovers
are not less burlesque than were those of the three Knights in ALBERT
SMITH'S romantic Extravaganza, _The Alhambra_, played then by ALFRED
WIGAN, and Mr. and Mrs. KEELEY. So if I may take it that "Farcical
Romance" is only a way out of describing the piece as "burlesque,"
then I know how to class it, and what to expect. Now I must own that
my puzzlement is due to my own fault, for it so chanced that I did not
look at the author's description of his play until after leaving the
theatre. I thought I was seeing something that was intended to be as
broad a farce as _Bébé, alias Betsy_, but I soon found that, whatever
it might be, it wasn't this. It is capitally acted by all, but
especially, on "the Spear Side," by Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH and F. KERR,
the former as an effeminate Earl, and the latter as a manly Viscount.
But, even from a burlesque point of view, Mr. ELLIOT overdoes the
Frenchman, a part which belongs to a stage-family of Frenchmen, of
which, in former times, ALFRED WIGAN was the best representative; and,
later, Mons. MARIUS, who, as the French sporting nobleman, in _Family
Ties_, in love with an English "Mees," and so proud of his English
slang, was simply the character to the life, without any more
exaggeration than was artistically necessary. On "the Spindle Side,"
Miss LILY HANBURY looks handsome, and is generally fairly well-suited;
Miss PATTIE BROWNE has the most difficult part of the three, and it is
not to be wondered at if she a bit out-tommies _Tommy_. Miss ELLALINE
TERRIS looks, acts, and sings charmingly as _Lady Wilhelmina_, and
Miss CALDWELL gives a good touch of low comedy to "the Sergeant."

The places where the fun comes in, as it does occasionally, and is
therefore the more precious, are chiefly with WEEDON GROSSMITH, and in
the scenes between Mr. F. KERR and Miss HANBURY. The piece is not up
to the former "screamers," such as _Dandy Dick_, _The Magistrate_, and
_My Aunt_, or whatever was the title of the farce in which Mr. WEEDON
GROSSMITH played the part of Mrs. JOHN WOOD'S solicitor. The scenery
by Mr. HALL is Hall good, specially the woodland scene in Overcote
Park.

"MUCH ADO ABOUT _NIL_."--Were the Temporal Power in existence, the
LORD MAYOR, in proposing the toast of the POPE before that of the
QUEEN, would have been guilty of a blunder, and we all know, on
TALLEYRAND'S authority, how far worse is a blunder than a crime. But
the POPE, being no longer "two single gentlemen rolled into one," but
simply, as it might be set down in a Play-bill of _Dramatis Personæ_,
"First Bishop," and also by his own style and title, "_Servus
Servorum_," the health of His Holiness (which is uncommonly good)
might, in British Dominions, be introduced after that of the QUEEN and
Royal Family, and could be fitted into Church and State as neatly
as possible, that is, where such a toast is a necessity of the
entertainment. But the stupidity of the incident has been surpassed by
the idiocy of the notice taken of it, and, for the sake of the common
sense of the Common Council, it is to be hoped that a large majority
will be on the side of Alderman and Sheriff RENALS, and refuse to
toast the LORD MAYOR on the Gridiron of LAWRENCE.

who may remember that _tragédienne_), but Mlle. GHERLSEN, representing
the Jew's daughter, does what the great RACHEL could not do, that is,
sing. _La Juive_ will be given during the Covent Garden season; so
these performances may be considered as very superior rehearsals.
_Carmen_ on Thursday, instead of _Il Trovatore_.--the _Trovatore_
being _Il_, couldn't appear. With all due sympathy and respect for
_Trovatore_, _Carmen_ was gratefully received. Signor PIGNALOSA,
as the _Toréador_, very good, and obtained his _encore_; so _this_
_Toréador_ was "_contento_." Mlle. GUERCIA was a fascinating _Carmen_,
and what is any _Carmen_ if not fascinating?

TAKEN IN, BUT NOT DONE FOR.

(_Overflow Letters, probably originally intended for a Contemporary._)

SIR,--No doubt you have seen in the papers recently a number of
letters, giving accounts of the stoppage of cabs by well-dressed young
men, who, after heartily greeting the occupants, have asked for the
loan of a sovereign. The other day something of the same sort
occurred to me. I got into an omnibus, when a man, purporting to be a
Conductor, asked me for my fare. I replied that I would pay him later
on. He then proceeded to mount to the roof, apparently to collect
other money, when I quickly descended. I firmly believe that, had
I not acted promptly, I should have been defrauded of three-pence.
Believe me, yours, &c.,


VIGILANT.

SIR,--I think you should know the last dodge. I was walking home from
a rather heavy dinner the other evening, when I came across a man
exactly like myself. He might have been my twin brother. He didn't say
anything, but put out his hand towards me as if asking for alms. Of
course I refused, as I could see that the man was drunk. A little
later I was escorted home by a policeman. The next morning, when I
got to the spot where I had been accosted by this silently-begging
stranger, I found a looking-glass. The police say they have the
matter in hand, but they do not see much prospect of finding the
original.--T. O'BACCUS.

SIR,--As a warning to the less wary, I beg to send you the following
particulars:--A short time ago I met at a Charity Banquet an Alderman
who was apparently a most excellent gentleman; and I lay a stress upon
this fact to show how deceptive are appearances. After the speeches,
my City friend said he would like to subscribe to the benefaction. He
asked me if I had change for a five-pound note. I replied I had only
four pounds. He said that that would do, and that I could forward
him the additional sovereign at my leisure. I then handed over the
quartette of golden coins in exchange for his bank-note. Immediately
afterwards I quitted the apartment to ascertain if the note was
genuine. I have not seen the Alderman since. I may add that although
I believe the draft a forgery, I have received its full alleged value
from the Bank of England.

CAUTION.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

_House of Commons, Monday, April 11._--LORD MAYOR OF DUBLIN dropped in
to pass time of day with SPEAKER. Accompanied by a score of his merry
Councilmen, arrayed in scarlet cloaks trimmed with costly furs. Made
ordinary Members in black coats feel very small. T. D. SULLIVAN, the
Bard of Erin, long known at Westminster, is also Member of Dublin
Corporation. Brought over his scarlet robes; took his seat within
the Bar; other Members of Corporation, of course, kept outside sacred
precincts. Some little disturbance at door when LORD MAYOR arrived in
procession, preceded by Mace, and accompanied by Sword-Bearer. These
wanted to enter House, and support his Lordship as he stood at Bar in
alien assembly.

"You enter only across my body," said the Serjeant-at-Arms, lightly,
but firmly, touching the hilt of his terrible brand.

A moment's awful pause. The sword brought over from Ireland would,
in weight and cubic capacity, have made ten of the rapier to which
ERSKINE of Cardross had significantly called attention. When, later,
it peacefully rested behind doorkeeper's chair, its mighty hilt rose
above topmost height like the cross on a cathedral spire. Sword-Bearer
looked at LORD MAYOR; Mace-Bearer grasped with both hands shaft of
his ponderous weapon. Both warriors accustomed to public meetings in
Dublin; knew what was expected of them by way of argument. LORD MAYOR
happily in placable mood. Readjusting around his neck the collar of
gold (the very one "MALACHI won from the proud Invader"), he bowed his
head; Mace and Sword were deposited behind doorkeeper's chair, and his
Lordship strode in, escorted by the crimson-gowned, fur-betrimmed City
Fathers.

LORD MAYOR, supported on either side by a stately Alderman, stood at
Bar holding what at first sight looked like a shillelagh.

"What have you there, my LORD MAYOR OF DUBLIN?" asked the SPEAKER, in
tones so stern they made the sword rattle in the scabbard on the other
side of the closed door.

Nothing escapes SPEAKER'S Eye when he pleases to bring it to bear on
a particular focus. Had seen the implement in LORD MAYOR'S hand;
insisted upon knowing all about it before proceedings went further.
Turned out to be nothing more dangerous than petition from Corporation
of Dublin in favour of Home-Rule Bill. SPEAKER, instantly mollified,
allowed it to be read; after which LORD MAYOR, bowing, retired; Mace
and Sword found all right, and possession resumed. As the thin red
streak filed out of doorway, T. D. S. still lingering in seat by
Cross Benches, said, as he looked admiringly upon the befurred crimson
robes. "Reminds me, TOBY, of a line from GOLDSMITH. You remember it in
_The Deserted Village?_

    'With blossom'd furze, unprofitably gay.'"

_Business done._--Eighth Night Debate on Home-Rule Bill.

_Tuesday._--Found VICARY GIBBS (well-known firm, SONS AND ANTONY
GIBBS, of the City and the Universe) rather in dumps to-night. Been a
burglar at family mansion in Regent's Park; the Firm at dinner;
SONS standing a little meal for ANTONY; burglar took opportunity of
entering by bedroom window, first observing precaution of screwing
up doors, and other entrances and exits, so that he might pursue
his vocation with that certainty of non-disturbance upon which all
well-bred burglars insist. Loot considerable, Providence blessing the
burglar with tea-pots and spoons to extent that would have excited
envy in heart of HANS BREITMANN.

"Well, cheer up," I said to young VICARY; "awkward, of course, to lose
this property; some of it, probably, heirlooms; at least, there was no
bloodshed. You should be thankful for that."

[Illustration: THE PARLIAMENTARY GOLF HANDICAP.]

"Not at all," said VICARY, the light of Ulster battle ditches flaming
in his eyes. "I should like to have shed some myself. But it isn't
that, nor is it the material jewels whose disappearance I lament. They
are things that are bought and sold; they may be replaced. Fact is,
old friend" (hate to see a strong young man sobbing), "there was more
than that."

"I didn't see anything else mentioned in the papers," I remarked.

"No; we resolved to bear our burden among ourselves. I don't mind
telling you, that beside the brooches, bracelets, chains, rings, and
other things of that sort, the fellows stole the notes I had made for
speech on Home-Rule Bill. Been here night after night since debate
opened, sitting patiently waiting to catch SPEAKER'S eye. Have given
up my dinner and other evening delights; night after night SPEAKER
has passed me over. I waited on; everything has its compensation;
the enforced delay proved invaluable, as supplying opportunity for
improving original draft of speech. As I sat and listened, great
thoughts surged through my mind; happy illustrations flashed upon me;
irresistible arguments were slowly moulded. Jotted 'em all down. Notes
getting, perhaps, a little long; couldn't have managed to work them
off in less than two hours; but House would, I know, have suffered
gladly for that time, or even longer. An audience that has survived
two hours of ASMEAD BARTLETT (Knight) is not disposed to mince
matters. Last night resolved to get it over: told PRINCE ARTHUR to
tell AKERS-DOUGLAS to arrange with SPEAKER to call me as near ten
o'clock as possible. Went home for slight repast; placed notes
of speech on dressing-table; thought with passing pleasure of the
policeman we have kept these thirty years perambulating St. Dunstan's
in view of possible burglar, and went to dinner. When I tripped
upstairs, meaning to go down to House, found notes gone, and,
incidentally, £2000 worth of jewellery. I won't disguise from you,
TOBY old man, my private conviction that the whole thing was a plant.
Mr. GLADSTONE'S _at the bottom of it!_"

_Business done._--Ninth Night Debate on Home-Rule Bill.

_Thursday._--SEXTON made five speeches to-night, each sufficient of
itself to lay foundation of parliamentary reputation. Had he spread
them over the Session, or even distributed them throughout a month,
would have scored great success. Unhappily worked them all off at
single sitting, without other interval than succession of long pauses,
arbitrarily introduced. Fancy he felt he must do something to maintain
ancient reputation. GRANDOLPH and JOHN MORLEY spoke for two hours
each, whilst few, having caught SPEAKER'S eye, let go under ninety
minutes. SEXTON must needs beat record; did it, talking for two hours
and half by Westminster clock! Had an hour and a half served, speech
would have been worthy to rank with those of ASQUITH, JOHN REDMOND,
and DAVITT. As it is, case one of oratorial suicide. CARSON followed;
quite moderate in comparison. Spoke for little over an hour. When he
sat down, it was after eight o'clock; more that one-half of possible
length of sitting exhausted; only two Members taken part in Debate.

"Debate d'ye call it," said LORD MORRIS, looking on from the Peer's
Gallery. "It's preaching rather--pragmatical prosing, the death of
useful Parliamentary discussion."

[Illustration: THE PARLIAMENTARY POLKA. "PAIRS PLEASE!"]

House left in almost comatose state. Someone faintly moved Count;
MARJORIEBANKS, who had not suffered the four hours' talk, and who, by
comparison with rest, seemed supernaturally active, managed to bring
in what was left of forty Members, and conversation drowsily proceeded
to appointed hour of closing. _Business done._--Eleventh Night.

_Scheherazade._ "And so, my Lord, he drew his scimitar, and was about
to---- But excuse me, Sultan, I observe, through the oriel window,
something that looks remarkably like the streak of dawn, and, if you
don't mind, I'll continue the story to-morrow night."

_Schahriah, Sultan of Persia._ "Thank you, no my dear, I have some dim
recollection that, in a former state, this sort of thing went on for
a Thousand and One Nights, ending in the most agreeable manner to the
principal personages concerned. But that, you will admit, was in other
circumstances. The world, and we, were younger then. Eleven nights of
this is enough for me, and, if you would be so good as to step into
the next room, I will give instructions for your being--excuse this
yawn--bowstrung."

[Illustration: Demon-Trap for Reporters.]

_Saturday_, 1.15 A.M.--Members streaming back from Division Lobby;
Mr. G. down on stroke of One o'clock: splendid speech--a mental and
physical miracle; for little over an hour he entranced an audience
still suffering from two hours of HENRY JAMES, throughout which
the eminent jurist sank below lowest level hitherto known of his
Parliamentary capacity. PRINCE ARTHUR at his best; in brisk fighting
mood, hitting out right and left; stirring TIM HEALY'S soul with
surging desire to get up and reply. No opportunity so TIM snapped at
him across Gangway, PRINCE ARTHUR cutting back with ever-smiling face.
When, just now Mr. G. walked in from Division Lobby, Liberals and
Irish Members leaped to their feet, welcoming him with waving hats,
and strident cheers. A moving scene, introducing announcement that,
in House of 651 Members, every absentee accounted for, Ministerial
majority ran up to 43. _Business done._--Home-Rule Bill read Second
Time.
