NOTE.--This bulletin, a joint contribution of the Bureau of Biological
Survey and the Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station, contains a
summary of the results of investigations of the relation of a subspecies
of kangaroo rat to the carrying capacity of the open ranges, being one
phase of a general study of the life histories of rodent groups as they
affect agriculture, forestry, and grazing.


IMPORTANCE OF RODENT GROUPS.


As the serious character of the depredations by harmful rodents is
recognized, State, Federal, and private expenditures for their control
increase year by year. These depredations include not only the attacks
by introduced rats and mice on food materials stored in granaries,
warehouses, commercial establishments, docks, and private houses, but
also, particularly in the Western States, the ravages of several groups
of native ground squirrels and other noxious rodents in grain and
certain other field crops. Nor is this all, for it has been found that
such rodents as prairie dogs, pocket gophers, marmots, ground squirrels,
and rabbits take appreciable and serious toll of the forage on the open
grazing range; in fact, that they reduce the carrying capacity of the
range to such an extent that expenditures for control measures are amply
justified. Current estimates place the loss of goods due to rats and
mice in warehouses and stores throughout the United States at no less
than $200,000,000 annually, and damage to the carrying capacity of the
open range and to cultivated crops generally by native rodents in the
Western States at $300,000,000 additional; added together, we have an
impressive total from depredations of rodents.

The distribution and life habits of rodents and the general
consideration of their relation to agriculture, forestry, and grazing,
with special reference to the carrying capacity of stock ranges, is a
subject that has received attention for many years from the Biological
Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture. As a result of
the investigations conducted much has been learned concerning the
economic status of most of the more important groups, and the knowledge
already gained forms the basis of the extensive rodent-control work
already in progress, and in which many States are cooperating with the
bureau. If the work is to be prosecuted intelligently and the fullest
measure of success achieved, it is essential that the consideration
largely of groups as a whole be supplemented by more exhaustive
treatment of the life histories of individual species and of their place
in the biological complex. The present report is based upon
investigations, chiefly in Arizona, of the life history, habits, and
economic status of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat, _Dipodomys
spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam (Pl. I).


INVESTIGATIONAL METHODS.

Some 18 years ago (in 1903) a tract of land 49.2 square miles in area on
the Coronado National Forest near the Santa Rita Mountains, Pima County,
southern Arizona, was closed to grazing by arrangement between the
Forest Service and the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University
of Arizona. Since that time another small tract of nearly a section has
been inclosed (Griffiths, 1910, 7[1]). This total area of approximately
50 square miles is known as the United States Range Reserve, and is
being devoted to a study of grazing conditions in this section and to
working out the best methods of administering the range (Pl. II, Fig.
1).

For some years an intensive study of the forage and other vegetative
conditions of this area has been made, the permanent vegetation quadrat,
as proposed by Dr. F. E. Clements (1905, 161-175), being largely
utilized. During the autumn of 1917 representatives of the Carnegie
Institution and the Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station visited the
Reserve and were impressed with the evidence of rodent damage to the
grass cover. The most conspicuous appearance of damage was noted about
the habitations of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys
spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam), although it was observed also that
jack rabbits of two species (_Lepus californicus eremicus_ Allen and _L.
alleni alleni_ Mearns), which were very abundant in some portions of the
reserve, were apparently affecting adversely the forage conditions in
particular localities. Accordingly, the Biological Survey, the
Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Arizona, the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the U. S. Forest Service have
undertaken a study of the relation of the more important rodents to the
forage crop of the Range Reserve in Arizona.

The present paper is a first step in this larger investigation.[2] In
this work the authors have made no attempt to deal with the taxonomic
side of the kangaroo rat problem. It is not unlikely that intensive
studies will show that the form now known as _Dipodomys spectabilis
spectabilis_ is made up of a number of local variants, some of them
perhaps worthy of recognition as additional subspecies. But it is felt
that the conclusions here reached will be little, if at all, affected by
such developments.

Color descriptions are based on Ridgway's Color Standards and Color
Nomenclature published in 1912.

IDENTIFICATION.


There are only three groups of mammals in the Southwest having external
cheek pouches. These are (_a_) the pocket gophers (Geomyidæ), which have
strong fore feet, relatively weak hind feet, and short tail, as compared
with weak fore feet, relatively strong hind feet, and long tail in the
other two; (_b_) the pocket mice (_Perognathus_), which are considerably
smaller than the kangaroo rats and lack the conspicuous white hip
stripe possessed by all the latter; and (_c_) the kangaroo rats
(_Dipodomys_).

[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Range, east of the Colorado River, of _Dipodomys
spectabilis spectabilis_ compared with that of _Dipodomys merriami_.
Cross hatching indicates area of overlapping of the two forms. The range
of _Dipodomys deserti_, not shown on the map, is west of that of
_spectabilis_, and so far as known the two do not overlap.]

_Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam requires comparison with
three other forms of kangaroo rats in the same general region, namely,
_D. deserti_ Stephens, of approximately the same size, and _D. merriami_
Mearns and _D. ordii_ Woodhouse, the last two of decidedly smaller size.
The range of _deserti_ lies principally to the west of that of
_spectabilis_, and the two do not, so far as known, overlap. On the
other hand, _merriami_ and _ordii_, and subspecies, occur over a large
part of the range of _spectabilis_, living in very close proximity to
its burrows; _merriami_ is even suspected of pillaging the stores of
_spectabilis_. The range of _merriami_, however, is much more extensive
than that of _spectabilis_ (Fig. 1), which argues against a definite
ecological dependence or relationship. Separation of the four forms
mentioned may be easily accomplished by the following key:

_Key to Species of_ Dipodomys _in Arizona._

_a^1_. Size much larger (hind foot and greatest length of skull more
than 42 millimeters); tail tipped with white.

     _b^1_. Upper parts dark brownish buffy; tail dark brownish or
     blackish with more sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal
     broader, distinctly separating mastoids (range in Arizona mainly
     southeastern part)                          =Dipodomys spectabilis.=

     _b^2_. Upper parts light ochraceous-buffy; tail pale brownish with
     less sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal narrower, reduced
     to mere spicule between mastoids (range in Arizona mainly
     southwestern part)                              =Dipodomys deserti.=

_a^2_. Size much smaller (hind foot and greatest length of skull less
than 42 millimeters); tail not tipped with white.

     _b^1_. Hind foot with four toes                =Dipodomys merriami.=

     _b^2_. Hind foot with five toes                   =Dipodomys ordii.=

On account of the small size, _merriami_ and _ordii_ do not require
detailed color comparison with the other two. The general color of the
upperparts of _spectabilis_ is much darker than that of _deserti_;
whereas _spectabilis_ is ochraceous-buff or light ochraceous-buff
grizzled with blackish, _deserti_ is near pale ochraceous-buff and lacks
the blackish.

The color of the upperparts alone amply suffices to distinguish
_spectabilis_ and _deserti_; but the different coloration of the tail is
the most obvious diagnostic feature. The near black of the middle
portion of the tail, the conspicuous white side stripes, and the pure
white tip make the tail of _spectabilis_ stand in rather vivid contrast
to the pale-brown and whitish tail of _deserti_.

The dens of the two larger species of _Dipodomys_--_spectabilis_ and
_deserti_--can be distinguished at a glance from those of the two
smaller--_merriami_ and _ordii_--by the fact that the mounds of the
former are usually of considerable size and the burrow mouths are of
greater diameter. On the Range Reserve _merriami_ erects no mounds, but
excavates its burrows in the open or at the base of _Prosopis_,
_Lycium_, or other brush. The mounds of _spectabilis_ are higher than
those of _deserti_, the entrances are larger, and they are located in
harder soil (Pl. III, Fig. 1). The dens of _deserti_ are usually more
extensive in surface area than those of _spectabilis_, and have a
greater number of openings (Pl. III, Fig. 2).

what the range has to offer.]

DESCRIPTION.


GENERAL CHARACTERS.

Size large; ears moderate, ear from crown (taken in dry skin) 9 or 10
millimeters; eyes prominent; whiskers long and sensitive; fore feet
short and weak; hind feet long and powerful, provided with four
well-developed toes; tail very long, usually 30 to 40 per cent longer
than the body. Cranium triangular, the occiput forming the base and the
point of the nose the apex of the triangle, much flattened, auditory and
particularly mastoid bullae conspicuously inflated.


COLOR.

General color above, brownish buffy, varying in some specimens to
lighter buffy tints, grizzled with black; oblique hip stripes white;
tail with dark-brown or blackish stripes above and below, running into
blackish about halfway between base and tip, and with two lateral side
stripes of white to a point about halfway back; tail tipped with pure
white for about 40 millimeters (Pl. I). Underparts white, hairs white to
bases, with some plumbeous and buffy hairs about base of tail; fore legs
and fore feet white all around; hind legs like back, brown above, hairs
with gray bases, becoming blackish (fuscous-black or chætura-black)
about ankles, hairs on under side white to bases; hind feet white above,
dark-brown or blackish (near fuscous) below.

Color variations in a series of 12 specimens from the type locality and
points widely scattered through the range of _spectabilis_ consist in
minor modifications of the degree of coloration, length of white tip of
tail, and length of white lateral tail stripes. In general the color
pattern and characters are remarkably uniform. Young specimens, while
exhibiting the color pattern and general color of adults, are
conspicuously less brown, and more grayish.

There appears to be little variation in color with season. In the series
at hand, most specimens taken during the fall, winter, and spring are
very slightly browner than those of summer, suggesting that the fresh
pelage following the fall molt is a little brighter than is the pelage
after being worn all winter and into the following summer. But at most
the difference is slight.


OIL GLAND.

Upon separating the hairs of the middle region of the back about a third
of the distance between the ears and the rump, one uncovers a prominent
gland, elliptical in outline, with long axis longitudinal and about 9
millimeters in length. The gland presents a roughened and granular
appearance, and fewer hairs grow upon it than elsewhere on the back. The
hairs in the vicinity are frequently matted, as if with a secretion. In
worn stage of pelage the gland may be visible from above without
separating the hairs. Bailey has suggested that this functions as an oil
gland for dressing the fur, and our observations bear out this view.
Kangaroo rats kept in captivity without earth or sand soon come to have
a bedraggled appearance, as if the pelage were moist. When supplied with
fine, dusty sand, they soon recover their normal sleek appearance.
Apparently the former condition is due to an excess of oil, the latter
to the absorption of the excess in a dust bath. The oil is doubtless an
important adjunct to the preservation of the skin and hair amid the
dusty surroundings in which the animal lives.


MEASUREMENTS AND WEIGHTS.

External measurements include: _Total length_, from tip of nose to tip
of tail without hairs, measured before skinning; _tail vertebræ_, length
of tail from point in angle when tail is bent at right angles to body to
tip of tail without hairs; and _hind foot_, from heel to tip of longest
claw.

The following are measurements of a series from the U. S. Range Reserve:
