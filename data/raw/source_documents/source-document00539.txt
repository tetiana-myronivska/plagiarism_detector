Book 04 Numbers
001:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent
        of Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second
        year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
001:002 "Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to
        the number of the names, every male, one by one;
001:003 from twenty years old and upward, all who are able to go
        out to war in Israel.  You and Aaron shall number them
        by their divisions.
001:004 With you there shall be a man of every tribe; everyone head
        of his fathers' house.
001:005 These are the names of the men who shall stand with you:
        Of Reuben:  Elizur the son of Shedeur.
001:006 Of Simeon:  Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
001:007 Of Judah:  Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
001:008 Of Issachar:  Nethanel the son of Zuar.
001:009 Of Zebulun:  Eliab the son of Helon.
001:010 Of the children of Joseph:  Of Ephraim:  Elishama the son of Ammihud.
        Of Manasseh:  Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
001:011 Of Benjamin:  Abidan the son of Gideoni.
001:012 Of Dan:  Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
001:013 Of Asher:  Pagiel the son of Ochran.
001:014 Of Gad:  Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
001:015 Of Naphtali:  Ahira the son of Enan."
001:016 These are those who were called of the congregation,
        the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads
        of the thousands of Israel.
001:017 Moses and Aaron took these men who are mentioned by name.
001:018 They assembled all the congregation together on the first
        day of the second month; and they declared their ancestry
        by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to
        the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
        one by one.
001:019 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
        wilderness of Sinai.
001:020 The children of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their generations,
        by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to
        the number of the names, one by one, every male from twenty
        years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;
001:021 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben,
        were forty-six thousand five hundred.
001:022 Of the children of Simeon, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, those who were numbered of it,
        according to the number of the names, one by one, every male
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        out to war;
001:023 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Simeon,
        were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
001:024 Of the children of Gad, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        out to war;
001:025 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad,
        were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
001:026 Of the children of Judah, their generations, by their families,

        out to war;
001:027 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Judah,
        were sixty-four thousand six hundred.
001:028 Of the children of Issachar, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        out to war;
001:029 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Issachar,
        were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
001:030 Of the children of Zebulun, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        out to war;
001:031 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Zebulun,
        were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
001:032 Of the children of Joseph, of the children of Ephraim,
        their generations, by their families, by their fathers'
        houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty
        years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;
001:033 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Ephraim,
        were forty thousand five hundred.
001:034 Of the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        out to war;
001:035 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Manasseh,
        were thirty-two thousand two hundred.
001:036 Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        out to war;
001:037 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Benjamin,
        were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
001:038 Of the children of Dan, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        forth to war;
001:039 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan,
        were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
001:040 Of the children of Asher, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        forth to war;
001:041 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Asher,
        were forty-one thousand five hundred.
001:042 Of the children of Naphtali, their generations, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go
        forth to war;
001:043 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Naphtali,
        were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
001:044 These are those who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron
        numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men:
        they were each one for his fathers' house.
001:045 So all those who were numbered of the children of Israel
        by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward,
        all who were able to go out to war in Israel;
001:046 even all those who were numbered were six hundred three thousand
        five hundred fifty.
001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
        numbered among them.
001:048 For Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
001:049 "Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, neither shall
        you take a census of them among the children of Israel;
001:050 but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony,
        and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it.
        They shall carry the tabernacle, and all its furnishings;
        and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.
001:051 When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down;
        and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set
        it up.  The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
001:052 The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man
        by his own camp, and every man by his own standard,
        according to their divisions.
001:053 But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony,
        that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children
        of Israel:  and the Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle
        of the Testimony."
001:054 Thus the children of Israel did.  According to all that Yahweh
        commanded Moses, so they did.
002:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
002:002 "The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard,
        with the banners of their fathers' houses:  at a distance
        from the tent of meeting shall they encamp around it."
002:003 Those who encamp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of
        the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their divisions:
        and the prince of the children of Judah shall be Nahshon
        the son of Amminadab.
002:004 His division, and those who were numbered of them,
        were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
002:005 Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar:
        and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel
        the son of Zuar.
002:006 His division, and those who were numbered of it, were fifty-four
        thousand four hundred.
002:007 The tribe of Zebulun:  and the prince of the children of Zebulun
        shall be Eliab the son of Helon.
002:008 His division, and those who were numbered of it, were fifty-seven
        thousand four hundred.
002:009 All who were numbered of the camp of Judah were one hundred
        eighty-six thousand four hundred, according to their divisions.
        They shall set out first.
002:010 "On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
        according to their divisions.  The prince of the children
        of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.
002:011 His division, and those who were numbered of it, were forty-six
        thousand five hundred.
002:012 "Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon.
        The prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel
        the son of Zurishaddai.
002:013 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were fifty-nine
        thousand three hundred.
002:014 "The tribe of Gad:  and the prince of the children of Gad
        shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.
002:015 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were forty-five
        thousand six hundred fifty.
002:016 "All who were numbered of the camp of Reuben were one hundred
        fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty, according to their armies.
        They shall set out second.
002:017 "Then the tent of meeting shall set out, with the camp
        of the Levites in the midst of the camps.  As they encamp,
        so shall they set out, every man in his place, by their standards.
002:018 "On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
        according to their divisions:  and the prince of the children
        of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.
002:019 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were forty
        thousand five hundred.
002:020 "Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh:  and the prince
        of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
002:021 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were thirty-two
        thousand two hundred.
002:022 "The tribe of Benjamin:  and the prince of the children
        of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.
002:023 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were thirty-five
        thousand four hundred.
002:024 "All who were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred
        eight thousand one hundred, according to their divisions.
        They shall set out third.
002:025 "On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan
        according to their divisions:  and the prince of the children
        of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
002:026 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were sixty-two
        thousand seven hundred.
002:027 "Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher:
        and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel
        the son of Ochran.
002:028 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were forty-one
        thousand and five hundred.
002:029 "The tribe of Naphtali:  and the prince of the children
        of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.
002:030 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were fifty-three
        thousand four hundred.
002:031 "All who were numbered of the camp of Dan were one hundred
        fifty-seven thousand six hundred.  They shall set out last
        by their standards."
002:032 These are those who were numbered of the children of Israel
        by their fathers' houses.  All who were numbered of the camps
        according to their armies were six hundred three thousand
        five hundred fifty.
002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
002:034 Thus the children of Israel did.  According to all that Yahweh
        commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards,
        and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to
        their fathers' houses.
003:001 Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses
        in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai.
003:002 These are the names of the sons of Aaron:  Nadab the firstborn,
        and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests
        who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in
        the priest's office.
003:004 Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh, when they offered strange
        fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had
        no children.  Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's
        office in the presence of Aaron their father.
003:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
003:006 "Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron
        the priest, that they may minister to him.
003:007 They shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
        congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service
        of the tabernacle.
003:008 They shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting,
        and the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the service
        of the tabernacle.
003:009 You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons.  They are
        wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel.
003:010 You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep
        their priesthood.  The stranger who comes near shall be
        put to death."
003:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
003:012 "Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children
        of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among
        the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:
003:013 for all the firstborn are mine.  On the day that I struck
        down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy
        to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal.
        They shall be mine.  I am Yahweh."
003:014 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
003:015 "Number the children of Levi by their fathers' houses,
        by their families:  every male from a month old and upward
        shall you number."
003:016 Moses numbered them according to the word of Yahweh,
        as he was commanded.
003:017 These were the sons of Levi by their names:  Gershon, and Kohath,
        and Merari.
003:018 These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families:
        Libni and Shimei.
003:019 The sons of Kohath by their families:  Amram, and Izhar, Hebron,
        and Uzziel.
003:020 The sons of Merari by their families:  Mahli and Mushi.
        These are the families of the Levites according to
        their fathers' houses.
003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family
        of the Shimeites:  these are the families of the Gershonites.
003:022 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all
        the males, from a month old and upward, even those who were
        numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred.
003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind
        the tabernacle westward.
003:024 The prince of the fathers' house of the Gershonites shall
        be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
003:025 The charge of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting shall
        be the tabernacle, and the tent, its covering, and the screen
        for the door of the Tent of Meeting,
003:026 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door
        of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and around the altar,
        and its cords for all of its service.
003:027 Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
        of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites,
        and the family of the Uzzielites:  these are the families
        of the Kohathites.
003:028 According to the number of all the males, from a month
        old and upward, there were eight thousand six hundred,
        keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall encamp on the south
        side of the tabernacle.
003:030 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of the Kohathites
        shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
003:031 Their charge shall be the ark, the table, the lamp stand,
        the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which they minister,
        and the screen, and all its service.
003:032 Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be prince of the princes
        of the Levites, with the oversight of those who keep the charge
        of the sanctuary.
003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family
        of the Mushites.  These are the families of Merari.
003:034 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number
        of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
        thousand two hundred.
003:035 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of Merari
        was Zuriel the son of Abihail.  They shall encamp on the north
        side of the tabernacle.
003:036 The appointed charge of the sons of Merari shall be the
        tabernacle's boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
        all its instruments, all its service,
003:037 the pillars of the court around it, their sockets, their pins,
        and their cords.
003:038 Those who encamp before the tabernacle eastward,
        in front of the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise,
        shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge
        of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel.
        The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
003:039 All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered
        at the commandment of Yahweh, by their families, all the males
        from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.
003:040 Yahweh said to Moses, "Number all the firstborn males
        of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
        and take the number of their names.
003:041 You shall take the Levites for me (I am Yahweh)
        instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel;
        and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn
        among the livestock of the children of Israel."
003:042 Moses numbered, as Yahweh commanded him, all the firstborn
        among the children of Israel.
003:043 All the firstborn males according to the number of names,
        from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them,
        were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.
003:044 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
003:045 "Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among
        the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites
        instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine.
        I am Yahweh.
003:046 For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the
        firstborn of the children of Israel, who exceed the number
        of the Levites,
003:047 you shall take five shekels apiece for each one;
        after the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them
        (the shekel is twenty gerahs):
003:048 and you shall give the money, with which the remainder of them
        is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons."
003:049 Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded
        the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;
003:050 from the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money,
        one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, after the shekel
        of the sanctuary:
003:051 and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons,
        according to the word of Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
004:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
004:002 "Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi,
        by their families, by their fathers' houses,
004:003 from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
        all who enter into the service, to do the work in the
        Tent of Meeting.
004:004 This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting,
        the most holy things.
004:005 When the camp moves forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons,
        and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover
        the ark of the Testimony with it,
004:006 and shall put a covering of sealskin on it, and shall spread
        over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its poles.
004:007 On the table of show bread they shall spread a blue cloth,
        and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the cups
        with which to pour out; and the continual bread shall be on it.
004:008 They shall spread on them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same
        with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.
004:009 They shall take a blue cloth, and cover the lampstand of the light,
        and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff dishes,
        and all its oil vessels, with which they minister to it.
004:010 They shall put it and all its vessels within a covering of sealskin,
        and shall put it on the frame.
004:011 On the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover
        it with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.
004:012 They shall take all the vessels of ministry, with which they
        minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth,
        and cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put
        them on the frame.
004:013 They shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
        a purple cloth on it.
004:014 They shall put on it all its vessels, with which they minister
        about it, the fire pans, the flesh hooks, the shovels,
        and the basins; all the vessels of the altar; and they shall
        spread on it a covering of sealskin, and put in its poles.
004:015 "When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary,
        and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp moves forward;
        after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to carry it:
        but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die.
        These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
        Tent of Meeting.
004:016 "The charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil
        for the light, the sweet incense, the continual meal offering,
        and the anointing oil, the charge of all the tabernacle,
        and of all that is in it, the sanctuary, and its furnishings."
004:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
004:018 "Don't cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
        from among the Levites;
004:019 but thus do to them, that they may live, and not die, when they
        approach to the most holy things:  Aaron and his sons shall go in,
        and appoint them everyone to his service and to his burden;
004:020 but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment,
        lest they die."
004:021 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
004:022 "Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers'
        houses, by their families;
004:023 from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall
        you number them; all who enter in to wait on the service,
        to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.
004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites,
        in serving and in bearing burdens:
004:025 they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the Tent
        of Meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is
        above on it, and the screen for the door of the Tent of Meeting,
004:026 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door
        of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and
        around the altar, and their cords, and all the instruments
        of their service, and whatever shall be done with them.
        Therein shall they serve.
004:027 At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
        service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden,
        and in all their service; and you shall appoint to them
        in charge all their burden.
004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites
        in the Tent of Meeting:  and their charge shall be under
        the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
004:029 "As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families,
        by their fathers' houses;
004:030 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old
        shall you number them, everyone who enters on the service,
        to do the work of the Tent of Meeting.
004:031 This is the charge of their burden, according to all their
        service in the Tent of Meeting:  the tabernacle's boards,
        its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
004:032 and the pillars of the court around it, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
        and with all their service:  and by name you shall appoint
        the instruments of the charge of their burden.
004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
        according to all their service, in the Tent of Meeting,
        under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
004:034 Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation
        numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families,
        and by their fathers' houses,
004:035 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the
        Tent of Meeting.
004:036 Those who were numbered of them by their families were two
        thousand seven hundred fifty.
004:037 These are those who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites,
        all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron
        numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
004:038 Those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, their families,
        and by their fathers' houses,
004:039 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the
        Tent of Meeting,
004:040 even those who were numbered of them, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, were two thousand six hundred thirty.
004:041 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Gershon, all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses
        and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh.
004:042 Those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari,
        by their families, by their fathers' houses,
004:043 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the
        Tent of Meeting,
004:044 even those who were numbered of them by their families,
        were three thousand two hundred.
004:045 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the
        commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
004:046 All those who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
        Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, by their families,
        and by their fathers' houses,
004:047 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered in to do the work of service, and the work
        of bearing burdens in the Tent of Meeting,
004:048 even those who were numbered of them, were eight thousand
        five hundred eighty.
004:049 According to the commandment of Yahweh they were numbered by Moses,
        everyone according to his service, and according to his burden.
        Thus were they numbered by him, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
005:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
005:002 "Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp
        every leper, and everyone who has an issue, and whoever
        is unclean by the dead.
005:003 Both male and female shall you put out, outside of the camp
        shall you put them; that they not defile their camp,
        in the midst of which I dwell."
005:004 The children of Israel did so, and put them out outside of the camp;
        as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
005:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
005:006 "Speak to the children of Israel:  When a man or woman commits
        any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Yahweh,
        and that soul is guilty;
005:007 then he shall confess his sin which he has done, and he shall
        make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it
        the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom
        he has been guilty.
005:008 But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made
        for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh
        shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement,
        by which atonement shall be made for him.
005:009 Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children
        of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.
005:010 Every man's holy things shall be his:  whatever any man gives
        the priest, it shall be his."
005:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
005:012 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them:
        If any man's wife goes astray, and is unfaithful to him,
005:013 and a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes
        of her husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled,
        and there is no witness against her, and she isn't taken
        in the act;
005:014 and the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous
        of his wife, and she is defiled:  or if the spirit
        of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife,
        and she isn't defiled:
005:015 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring
        her offering for her:  the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal.
        He shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it
        is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial,
        bringing iniquity to memory.
005:016 The priest shall bring her near, and set her before Yahweh;
005:017 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;
        and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle
        the priest shall take, and put it into the water.
005:018 The priest shall set the woman before Yahweh, and let the hair
        of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal offering of
        memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy.
        The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness
        that brings a curse.
005:019 The priest shall cause her to swear, and shall tell the woman,
        'If no man has lain with you, and if you haven't gone aside
        to uncleanness, being under your husband, be free from this
        water of bitterness that brings a curse.
005:020 But if you have gone astray, being under your husband,
        and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you
        besides your husband:'
005:021 then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath
        of cursing, and the priest shall tell the woman, 'Yahweh make
        you a curse and an oath among your people, when Yahweh allows
        your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;
005:022 and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels,
        and make your body swell, and your thigh fall away.'
        The woman shall say, 'Amen, Amen.'
005:023 "The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall
        blot them out into the water of bitterness.
005:024 He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes
        the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter
        into her and become bitter.
005:025 The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the
        woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh,
        and bring it to the altar.
005:026 The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering,
        as the memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, and afterward
        shall make the woman drink the water.
005:027 When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen,
        if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against
        her husband, that the water that causes the curse will
        enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell,
        and her thigh will fall away:  and the woman will be a curse
        among her people.
005:028 If the woman isn't defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free,
        and shall conceive seed.
005:029 "This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband,
        goes astray, and is defiled;
005:030 or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous
        of his wife; then he shall set the woman before Yahweh,
        and the priest shall execute on her all this law.
005:031 The man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall
        bear her iniquity."
006:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them:  When either
        man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite,
        to separate himself to Yahweh,
006:003 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink.
        He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink,
        neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh
        grapes or dried.
006:004 All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is
        made of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.
006:005 "All the days of his vow of separation there shall no
        razor come on his head, until the days are fulfilled,
        in which he separates himself to Yahweh.  He shall be holy.
        He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
006:006 "All the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he shall
        not go near a dead body.
006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for
        his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die;
        because his separation to God is on his head.
006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.
006:009 "If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head
        of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day
        of his cleansing.  On the seventh day he shall shave it.
006:010 On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young
        pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.
006:011 The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other
        for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he
        sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy
        that same day.
006:012 He shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation,
        and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering;
        but the former days shall be void, because his separation
        was defiled.
006:013 "This is the law of the Nazirite:  when the days of his
        separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door
        of the Tent of Meeting,
006:014 and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh, one male lamb
        a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
        ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering,
        and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
006:015 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour
        mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil,
        and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.
006:016 The priest shall present them before Yahweh, and shall offer
        his sin offering, and his burnt offering.
006:017 He shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
        to Yahweh, with the basket of unleavened bread.  The priest
        shall offer also its meal offering, and its drink offering.
006:018 The Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door
        of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of the head
        of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under
        the sacrifice of peace offerings.
006:019 The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one
        unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer,
        and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has
        shaved the head of his separation;
006:020 and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.
        This is holy for the priest, together with the breast that is
        waved and the thigh that is offered.  After that the Nazirite
        may drink wine.
006:021 "This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, and of his offering
        to Yahweh for his separation, besides that which he is able to get.
        According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law
        of his separation."
006:022 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:023 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is how you
        shall bless the children of Israel.'  You shall tell them,
006:024 'Yahweh bless you, and keep you.
006:025 Yahweh make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you.
006:026 Yahweh lift up his face toward you, and give you peace.'
006:027 "So they shall put my name on the children of Israel;
        and I will bless them."
007:001 It happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up
        the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it,
        with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels,
        and had anointed and sanctified them;
007:002 that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers'
        houses, offered.  These were the princes of the tribes.
        These are they who were over those who were numbered:
007:003 and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons,
        and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for
        each one an ox:  and they presented them before the tabernacle.
007:004 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
007:005 "Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service
        of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites,
        to every man according to his service."
007:006 Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
007:007 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon,
        according to their service:
007:008 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari,
        according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar
        the son of Aaron the priest.
007:009 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service
        of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it
        on their shoulders.
007:010 The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar
        in the day that it was anointed, even the princes gave their
        offerings before the altar.
007:011 Yahweh said to Moses, "They shall offer their offering,
        each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar."
007:012 He who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son
        of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah,
007:013 and his offering was:  one silver platter, the weight of which was
        one hundred thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels,
        after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine
        flour mixed with oil for a meal offering;

        This was the offering of Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

007:089 When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh,
        he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that
        was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim:
        and he spoke to him.
008:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
008:002 "Speak to Aaron, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps,
        the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.'"
008:003 Aaron did so.  He lit its lamps to light the area in front
        of the lampstand, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
008:004 This was the workmanship of the lampstand, beaten work of gold.
        From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work:
        according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses,
        so he made the lampstand.
008:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
008:006 "Take the Levites from among the children of Israel,
        and cleanse them.
008:007 Thus shall you do to them, to cleanse them:  sprinkle the water
        of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor,
        and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
008:008 Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering,
        fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall
        take for a sin offering.
008:009 You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting.
        You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel.
008:010 You shall present the Levites before Yahweh.  The children
        of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,
008:011 and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering,
        on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs
        to do the service of Yahweh.
008:012 The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls,
        and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for
        a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.
008:013 You shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,
        and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.
008:014 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children
        of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
008:015 "After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of
        the Tent of Meeting:  and you shall cleanse them, and offer
        them as a wave offering.
008:016 For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel;
        instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all
        the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.
008:017 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine,
        both man and animal.  On the day that I struck all the firstborn
        in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.
008:018 I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among
        the children of Israel.
008:019 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons
        from among the children of Israel, to do the service of
        the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make
        atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague
        among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel
        come near to the sanctuary."
008:020 Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, to the Levites.  According to all that Yahweh
        commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children
        of Israel did to them.
008:021 The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed
        their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering
        before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
008:022 After that, the Levites went in to do their service in
        the Tent of Meeting before Aaron, and before his sons:
        as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
        so they did to them.
008:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
008:024 "This is that which belongs to the Levites:  from twenty-five
        years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service
        in the work of the Tent of Meeting;
008:025 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting
        on the work, and shall serve no more,
008:026 but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent
        of Meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
        Thus shall you do to the Levites concerning their duties."
009:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first
        month of the second year after they had come out of the land
        of Egypt, saying,
009:002 "Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover
        in its appointed season.
009:003 On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep
        it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes,
        and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep it."
009:004 Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should
        keep the Passover.
009:005 They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth
        day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai.
        According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children
        of Israel did.
009:006 There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body
        of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day,
        and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
009:007 Those men said to him, "We are unclean because of the dead
        body of a man.  Why are we kept back, that we may not offer
        the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among
        the children of Israel?"
009:008 Moses answered them, "Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will
        command concerning you."
009:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
009:010 "Say to the children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your
        generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a
        journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.
009:011 In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they
        shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread
        and bitter herbs.
009:012 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone
        of it.  According to all the statute of the Passover they
        shall keep it.
009:013 But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails
        to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
        Because he didn't offer the offering of Yahweh in its
        appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
009:014 If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover
        to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover,
        and according to its ordinance, so shall he do.
        You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him
        who is born in the land.'"
009:015 On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud
        covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony:
        and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were
        the appearance of fire, until morning.
009:016 So it was continually.  The cloud covered it, and the appearance
        of fire by night.
009:017 Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after
        that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where
        the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.
009:018 At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled,
        and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped.  As long
        as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.
009:019 When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days,
        then the children of Israel kept the charge of Yahweh,
        and didn't travel.
009:020 Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle;
        then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped,
        and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.
009:021 Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning;
        and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled:
        or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.
009:022 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud
        stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children
        of Israel remained encamped, and didn't travel; but when it
        was taken up, they traveled.
009:023 At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment
        of Yahweh they traveled.  They kept the charge of Yahweh,
        at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
010:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
010:002 Make you two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shall you make them:
        and you shall use them for the calling of the congregation,
        and for the journeying of the camps.
010:003 When they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather
        themselves to you at the door of the tent of meeting.
010:004 If they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands
        of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
010:005 When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side
        shall take their journey.
010:006 When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie
        on the south side shall take their journey:  they shall blow
        an alarm for their journeys.
010:007 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow,
        but you shall not sound an alarm.
010:008 The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they
        shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.
010:009 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who
        oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets;
        and you shall be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you
        shall be saved from your enemies.
010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts,
        and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets
        over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your
        peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial
        before your God:  I am Yahweh your God.
010:011 It happened in the second year, in the second month,
        on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken
        up from over the tent of the testimony.
010:012 The children of Israel set forward according to their journeys
        out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in
        the wilderness of Paran.
010:013 They first took their journey according to the commandment
        of Yahweh by Moses.
010:014 In the first [place] the standard of the camp of the children
        of Judah set forward according to their armies:
        and over his army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
010:015 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
        Nethanel the son of Zuar.
010:016 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab
        the son of Helon.
010:017 The tent was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons
        of Merari, who bore the tent, set forward.
010:018 The standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to
        their armies:  and over his army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
010:019 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
        Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
010:020 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph
        the son of Deuel.
010:021 The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary:
        and [the others] did set up the tent against their coming.
010:022 The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward
        according to their armies:  and over his army was Elishama
        the son of Ammihud.
010:023 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
        Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
010:024 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
        Abidan the son of Gideoni.
010:025 The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the
        rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their armies:
        and over his army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
010:026 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel
        the son of Ochran.
010:027 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira
        the son of Enan.
010:028 Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according
        to their armies; and they set forward.
010:029 Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses'
        father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said,
        I will give it to you:  come you with us, and we will do you good;
        for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.
010:030 He said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land,
        and to my relatives.
010:031 He said, Don't leave us, please; because you know how we
        are to encamp in the wilderness, and you shall be to us
        instead of eyes.
010:032 It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever
        good Yahweh shall do to us, the same will we do to you.
010:033 They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days' journey;
        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them
        three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
010:034 The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward
        from the camp.
010:035 It happened, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
        Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered;
        and let those who hate you flee before you.
010:036 When it rested, he said, Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands
        of the thousands of Israel.
011:001 The people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Yahweh:
        and when Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire
        of Yahweh burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost
        part of the camp.
011:002 The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh,
        and the fire abated.
011:003 The name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire
        of Yahweh burnt among them.
011:004 The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly:
        and the children of Israel also wept again, and said,
        Who shall give us flesh to eat?
011:005 We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing;
        the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,
        and the garlic:
011:006 but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save
        this manna to look on.
011:007 The manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance of it
        as the appearance of bdellium.
011:008 The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,
        or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it:
        and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
011:009 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
011:010 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families,
        every man at the door of his tent:  and the anger of Yahweh
        was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.
011:011 Moses said to Yahweh, Why have you dealt ill with your servant?
        and why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay
        the burden of all this people on me?
011:012 Have I conceived all this people?  Have I brought them forth,
        that you should tell me, Carry them in your bosom,
        as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you
        swore to their fathers?
011:013 Where should I get meat to give to all this people? for they
        weep to me, saying, Give us meat, that we may eat.
011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is
        too heavy for me.
011:015 If you deal thus with me, please kill me out of hand, if I have
        found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
011:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders
        of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people,
        and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting,
        that they may stand there with you.
011:017 I will come down and talk with you there:  and I will take
        of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them;
        and they shall bear the burden of the people with you,
        that you not bear it yourself alone.
011:018 Say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow,
        and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears
        of Yahweh, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was
        well with us in Egypt:  therefore Yahweh will give you flesh,
        and you shall eat.
011:019 You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days,
        neither ten days, nor twenty days,
011:020 but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it
        be loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Yahweh
        who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came
        we forth out of Egypt?
011:021 Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
        thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh,
        that they may eat a whole month.
011:022 Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them?
        or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,
        to suffice them?
011:023 Yahweh said to Moses, Has Yahweh's hand grown short? now shall
        you see whether my word shall happen to you or not.
011:024 Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh:
        and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people,
        and set them round about the Tent.
011:025 Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of
        the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders:
        and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them,
        they prophesied, but they did so no more.
011:026 But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad,
        and the name of the other Medad:  and the Spirit rested on them;
        and they were of those who were written, but had not gone
        out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
011:027 There ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad
        do prophesy in the camp.
011:028 Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his
        chosen men, answered, My lord Moses, forbid them.
011:029 Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake?
        I wish that all Yahweh's people were prophets, that Yahweh
        would put his Spirit on them!
011:030 Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
011:031 There went forth a wind from Yahweh, and brought quails
        from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's
        journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side,
        round about the camp, and about two cubits above the surface
        of the earth.
011:032 The people rose up all that day, and all the night,
        and all the next day, and gathered the quails:
        he who gathered least gathered ten homers:  and they spread
        them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
011:033 While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed,
        the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh
        struck the people with a very great plague.
011:034 The name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there
        they buried the people who lusted.
011:035 From Kibrothhattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth;
        and they abode at Hazeroth.
012:001 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite
        woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.
012:002 They said, Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses?  Hasn't he
        spoken also with us?  Yahweh heard it.
012:003 Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were
        on the surface of the earth.
012:004 Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron,
        and to Miriam, Come out you three to the tent of meeting.
        They three came out.
012:005 Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of
        the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
012:006 He said, Hear now my words:  if there be a prophet among you,
        I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision, I will
        speak with him in a dream.
012:007 My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:
012:008 with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly,
        and not in dark speeches; and the form of Yahweh shall he see:
        why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant,
        against Moses?
012:009 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.
012:010 The cloud removed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous,
        as [white as] snow:  and Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold,
        she was leprous.
012:011 Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please don't lay sin on us,
        for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.
012:012 Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half
        consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
012:013 Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, Heal her, God, I beg you.
012:014 Yahweh said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face,
        shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up
        outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall
        be brought in again.
012:015 Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days:
        and the people didn't travel until Miriam was brought in again.
012:016 Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped
        in the wilderness of Paran.
013:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
013:002 Send you men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan,
        which I give to the children of Israel:  of every tribe of their
        fathers shall you send a man, everyone a prince among them.
013:003 Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to
        the commandment of Yahweh:  all of them men who were heads
        of the children of Israel.
013:004 These were their names:  Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
        son of Zaccur.
013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi
        the son of Susi.
013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
013:016 These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land.
        Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
013:017 Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them,
        Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country:
013:018 and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein,
        whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
013:019 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad;
        and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps,
        or in strongholds;
013:020 and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean,
        whether there is wood therein, or not.  Be of good courage,
        and bring of the fruit of the land.  Now the time was the time
        of the first-ripe grapes.
013:021 So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness
        of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.
013:022 They went up by the South, and came to Hebron;
        and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.
        (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
013:023 They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there
        a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on
        a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates,
        and of the figs.
013:024 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster
        which the children of Israel cut down from there.
013:025 They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
013:026 They went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation
        of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh;
        and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation,
        and shown them the fruit of the land.
013:027 They told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us;
        and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is
        the fruit of it.
013:028 However the people who dwell in the land are strong,
        and the cities are fortified, [and] very great:
        and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
013:029 Amalek dwells in the land of the South:  and the Hittite,
        and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill country;
        and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side
        of the Jordan.
013:030 Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up
        at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
013:031 But the men who went up with him said, We aren't able to go
        up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
013:032 They brought up an evil report of the land which they had
        spied out to the children of Israel, saying, The land,
        through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats
        up the inhabitants of it; and all the people who we saw in it
        are men of great stature.
013:033 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of
        the Nephilim:  and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,
        and so we were in their sight.
014:001 All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;
        and the people wept that night.
014:002 All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron:
        and the whole congregation said to them, Would that we
        had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died
        in this wilderness!
014:003 Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword?
        Our wives and our little ones will be a prey:  wouldn't it
        be better for us to return into Egypt?
014:004 They said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us
        return into Egypt.
014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
        of the congregation of the children of Israel.
014:006 Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes:
014:007 and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out,
        is an exceeding good land.
014:008 If Yahweh delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
        and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
014:009 Only don't rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people
        of the land; for they are bread for us:  their defense
        is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us:
        don't fear them.
014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.
        The glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of meeting to all
        the children of Israel.
014:011 Yahweh said to Moses, How long will this people despise me?
        and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs
        which I have worked among them?
014:012 I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
        and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.
014:013 Moses said to Yahweh, Then the Egyptians will hear it;
        for you brought up this people in your might from among them;
014:014 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.
        They have heard that you Yahweh are in the midst of this people;
        for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands
        over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day,
        and in a pillar of fire by night.
014:015 Now if you shall kill this people as one man, then the nations
        which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,
014:016 Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into
        the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them
        in the wilderness.
014:017 Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you
        have spoken, saying,
014:018 Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
        forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means
        clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers
        on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.
014:019 Pardon, Please, the iniquity of this people according to
        the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you
        have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
014:020 Yahweh said, I have pardoned according to your word:
014:021 but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be
        filled with the glory of Yahweh;
014:022 because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs,
        which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted
        me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;
014:023 surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers,
        neither shall any of those who despised me see it:
014:024 but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
        and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
        into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.
014:025 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley:
        tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way
        to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
014:026 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
014:027 How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur
        against me?  I have heard the murmurings of the children
        of Israel, which they murmur against me.
014:028 Tell them, As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken
        in my ears, so will I do to you:
014:029 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all
        who were numbered of you, according to your whole number,
        from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
014:030 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I
        swore that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
014:031 But your little ones, that you said should be a prey,
        them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which
        you have rejected.
014:032 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
014:033 Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years,
        and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies
        be consumed in the wilderness.
014:034 After the number of the days in which you spied out the land,
        even forty days, for every day a year, shall you bear your
        iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my alienation.
014:035 I, Yahweh, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this
        evil congregation, who are gathered together against me:
        in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there
        they shall die.
014:036 The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned,
        and made all the congregation to murmur against him,
        by bringing up an evil report against the land,
014:037 even those men who did bring up an evil report of the land,
        died by the plague before Yahweh.
014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.
014:039 Moses told these words to all the children of Israel:
        and the people mourned greatly.
014:040 They rose up early in the morning, and got them up
        to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we are here,
        and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised:
        for we have sinned.
014:041 Moses said, Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh,
        seeing it shall not prosper?
014:042 Don't go up, for Yahweh isn't among you; that you not be struck
        down before your enemies.
014:043 For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you,
        and you shall fall by the sword:  because you are turned back
        from following Yahweh, therefore Yahweh will not be with you.
014:044 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain:
        nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and Moses,
        didn't depart out of the camp.
014:045 Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who lived
        in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down,
        even to Hormah.
015:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
015:002 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you are
        come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,
015:003 and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering,
        or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering,
        or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor to Yahweh,
        of the herd, or of the flock;
015:004 then shall he who offers his offering offer to Yahweh a meal
        offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed
        with the fourth part of a hin of oil:
015:005 and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin,
        shall you prepare with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice,
        for each lamb.
015:006 Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth
        parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with the third part
        of a hin of oil:
015:007 and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part
        of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
015:008 When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice,
        to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh;
015:009 then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth
        parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil:
015:010 and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine,
        for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
015:011 Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram,
        or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.
015:012 According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you
        do to everyone according to their number.
015:013 All who are native-born shall do these things after this manner,
        in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
015:014 If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may
        be among you throughout your generations, and will offer
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh;
        as you do, so he shall do.
015:015 For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you,
        and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner [with you],
        a statute forever throughout your generations:  as you are,
        so shall the foreigner be before Yahweh.
015:016 One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger
        who lives as a foreigner with you.
015:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
015:018 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come
        into the land where I bring you,
015:019 then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land,
        you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.
015:020 Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a
        wave offering:  as the wave offering of the threshing floor,
        so shall you heave it.
015:021 Of the first of your dough you shall give to Yahweh a wave
        offering throughout your generations.
015:022 When you shall err, and not observe all these commandments,
        which Yahweh has spoken to Moses,
015:023 even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that
        Yahweh gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;
015:024 then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge
        of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one
        young bull for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor to Yahweh,
        with the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it,
        according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.
015:025 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation
        of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven;
        for it was an error, and they have brought their offering,
        an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering
        before Yahweh, for their error:
015:026 and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall
        be forgiven, and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them;
        for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
015:027 If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female
        goat a year old for a sin offering.
015:028 The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs,
        when he sins unwittingly, before Yahweh, to make atonement for him;
        and he shall be forgiven.
015:029 You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly,
        for him who is native-born among the children of Israel,
        and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.
015:030 But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is
        native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes Yahweh;
        and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
015:031 Because he has despised the word of Yahweh, and has broken
        his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off;
        his iniquity shall be on him.
015:032 While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found
        a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
015:033 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses
        and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
015:034 They put him in custody, because it had not been declared
        what should be done to him.
015:035 Yahweh said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death:
        all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside
        of the camp.
015:036 All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned
        him to death with stones; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
015:037 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
015:038 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they
        should make them fringes{or, tassels (Hebrew tzitzit)} in
        the borders of their garments throughout their generations,
        and that they put on the fringe{or, tassel} of each border
        a cord of blue:
015:039 and it shall be to you for a fringe{or, tassel}, that you may look
        on it, and remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and do them;
        and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes,
        after which you use to play the prostitute;
015:040 that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy
        to your God.
015:041 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
        to be your God:  I am Yahweh your God.
016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
        with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son
        of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [men]:
016:002 and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children
        of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation,
        called to the assembly, men of renown;
016:003 and they assembled themselves together against Moses and
        against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you,
        seeing all the congregation are holy, everyone of them,
        and Yahweh is among them:  why then lift yourselves up above
        the assembly of Yahweh?
016:004 When Moses heard it, he fell on his face:
016:005 and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the
        morning Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy,
        and will cause him to come near to him:  even him whom he shall
        choose he will cause to come near to him.
016:006 This do:  take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
016:007 and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow:
        and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh does choose, he [shall
        be] holy:  you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.
016:008 Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:
016:009 [seems it but] a small thing to you, that the God of Israel
        has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
        you near to himself, to do the service of the tent of Yahweh,
        and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
016:010 and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons
        of Levi with you? and seek you the priesthood also?
016:011 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together
        against Yahweh:  and Aaron, what is he who you murmur against him?
016:012 Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab;
        and they said, We won't come up:
016:013 is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land
        flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,
        but you must needs make yourself also a prince over us?
016:014 Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk
        and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards:
        will you put out the eyes of these men? we won't come up.
016:015 Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, "Don't respect
        their offering:  I have not taken one donkey from them,
        neither have I hurt one of them."
016:016 Moses said to Korah, You and all your company go before Yahweh,
        you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:
016:017 and take every man his censer, and put incense on them,
        and bring you before Yahweh every man his censer, two hundred
        fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.
016:018 They took every man his censer, and put fire in them,
        and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent
        of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
016:019 Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door
        of the tent of meeting:  and the glory of Yahweh appeared
        to all the congregation.
016:020 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
        consume them in a moment.
016:022 They fell on their faces, and said, God, the God of the spirits
        of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry
        with all the congregation?
016:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
016:024 Speak to the congregation, saying, Get away from around the tent
        of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
016:025 Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders
        of Israel followed him.
016:026 He spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
        from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs,
        lest you be consumed in all their sins.
016:027 So they got them up from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
        on every side:  and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood
        at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons,
        and their little ones.
016:028 Moses said, Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do
        all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind.
016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they
        be visited after the visitation of all men; then Yahweh
        hasn't sent me.
016:030 But if Yahweh make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth,
        and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them,
        and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand
        that these men have despised Yahweh.
016:031 It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words,
        that the ground split apart that was under them;
016:032 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up,
        and their households, and all the men who appertained to Korah,
        and all their goods.
016:033 So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive
        into Sheol:  and the earth closed on them, and they perished
        from among the assembly.
016:034 All Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them;
        for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
016:035 Fire came forth from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred
        fifty men who offered the incense.
016:036 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
016:037 Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up
        the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder;
        for they are holy,
016:038 even the censers of these sinners against their own lives;
        and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar:
        for they offered them before Yahweh; therefore they are holy;
        and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
016:039 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who
        were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering
        of the altar,
016:040 to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that
        no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn
        incense before Yahweh; that he not be as Korah, and as his company:
        as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.
016:041 But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel
        murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have
        killed the people of Yahweh.
016:042 It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses
        and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting:
        and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.
016:043 Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
016:044 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
016:045 Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them
        in a moment.  They fell on their faces.
016:046 Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire therein
        from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it
        quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them:
        for there is wrath gone out from Yahweh; the plague is begun.
016:047 Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly;
        and behold, the plague was begun among the people:
        and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
016:048 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
016:049 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and
        seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.
016:050 Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting:
        and the plague was stayed.
017:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
017:002 Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods,
        one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according
        to their fathers' houses, twelve rods:  write you every man's
        name on his rod.
017:003 You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there
        shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.
017:004 You shall lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony,
        where I meet with you.
017:005 It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose
        shall bud:  and I will make to cease from me the murmurings
        of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
017:006 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes
        gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers'
        houses, even twelve rods:  and the rod of Aaron was
        among their rods.
017:007 Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.
017:008 It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent
        of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house
        of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms,
        and bore ripe almonds.
017:009 Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all
        the children of Israel:  and they looked, and took every
        man his rod.
017:010 Yahweh said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony,
        to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion;
        that you may make an end of their murmurings against me,
        that they not die.
017:011 Thus did Moses:  as Yahweh commanded him, so did he.
017:012 The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we perish,
        we are undone, we are all undone.
017:013 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tent of Yahweh, dies:
        shall we perish all of us?
018:001 Yahweh said to Aaron, You and your sons and your fathers'
        house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary;
        and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity
        of your priesthood.
018:002 Your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father,
        bring you near with you, that they may be joined to you,
        and minister to you:  but you and your sons with you shall
        be before the tent of the testimony.
018:003 They shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the Tent:
        only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary
        and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you.
018:004 They shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of
        the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent:
        and a stranger shall not come near to you.
018:005 You shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of
        the altar; that there be wrath no more on the children of Israel.
018:006 I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among
        the children of Israel:  to you they are a gift, given to Yahweh,
        to do the service of the tent of meeting.
018:007 You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for
        everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you
        shall serve:  I give you the priesthood as a service of gift:
        and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
018:008 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, I, behold, I have given you the charge
        of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children
        of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing,
        and to your sons, as a portion forever.
018:009 This shall be your of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire:
        every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs,
        and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering
        of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy
        for you and for your sons.
018:010 As the most holy things shall you eat of it; every male shall
        eat of it:  it shall be holy to you.
018:011 This is your:  the wave offering of their gift, even all
        the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given
        them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you,
        as a portion forever; everyone who is clean in your house
        shall eat of it.
018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage,
        and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give
        to Yahweh, to you have I given them.
018:013 The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they
        bring to Yahweh, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your
        house shall eat of it.
018:014 Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.
018:015 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they
        offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal shall be yours:
        nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem,
        and the firstborn of unclean animals shall you redeem.
018:016 Those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall
        you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money
        of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary
        (the same is twenty gerahs).
018:017 But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep,
        or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy:
        you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall
        burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet
        savor to Yahweh.
018:018 The flesh of them shall be your, as the wave offering breast
        and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.
018:019 All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children
        of Israel offer to Yahweh, have I given you, and your
        sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever:
        it is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to
        your seed with you.
018:020 Yahweh said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land,
        neither shall you have any portion among them:  I am your
        portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.
018:021 To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe
        in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service
        which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.
018:022 Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the tent
        of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting,
        and they shall bear their iniquity:  it shall be a statute
        forever throughout your generations; and among the children
        of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
018:024 For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave
        offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance:
        therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel
        they shall have no inheritance.
018:025 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
018:026 Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them,
        When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I
        have given you from them for your inheritance, then you
        shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe
        of the tithe.
018:027 Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it
        were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness
        of the winepress.
018:028 Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all
        your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel;
        and of it you shall give Yahweh's wave offering to Aaron the priest.
018:029 Out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering
        of Yahweh, of all the best of it, even the holy part of it
        out of it.
018:030 Therefore you shall tell them, When you heave the best of it
        from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase
        of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress.
018:031 You shall eat it in every place, you and your households:
        for it is your reward in return for your service in the
        tent of meeting.
018:032 You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved
        from it the best of it:  and you shall not profane the holy
        things of the children of Israel, that you not die.
019:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
019:002 This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded,
        saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring
        you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish,
        [and] on which never came yoke.
019:003 You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring
        her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her
        before his face:
019:004 and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
        and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of
        meeting seven times.
019:005 One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh,
        and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
019:006 and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
        and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe
        his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp,
        and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
019:008 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe
        his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
019:009 A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
        and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place;
        and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children
        of Israel for a water for impurity:  it is a sin offering.
019:010 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes,
        and be unclean until the even:  and it shall be to the children
        of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner
        among them, for a statute forever.
019:011 He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
019:012 the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day,
        and on the seventh day he shall be clean:  but if he doesn't
        purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall
        not be clean.
019:013 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died,
        and doesn't purify himself, defiles the tent of Yahweh;
        and that soul shall be cut off from Israel:  because the water
        for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean;
        his uncleanness is yet on him.
019:014 This is the law when a man dies in a tent:  everyone who comes
        into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be
        unclean seven days.
019:015 Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
019:016 Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword,
        or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be
        unclean seven days.
019:017 For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning
        of the sin offering; and running water shall be put thereto
        in a vessel:
019:018 and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
        and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on
        the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone,
        or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:
019:019 and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day,
        and on the seventh day:  and on the seventh day he shall purify him;
        and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and shall be clean at even.
019:020 But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
        that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly,
        because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh:
        the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him;
        he is unclean.
019:021 It shall be a perpetual statute to them:  and he who sprinkles
        the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who
        touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.
019:022 Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean;
        and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until even.
020:001 The children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month:
        and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there,
        and was buried there.
020:002 There was no water for the congregation:  and they assembled
        themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
020:003 The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we
        had died when our brothers died before Yahweh!
020:004 Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness,
        that we should die there, we and our animals?
020:005 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us
        in to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs,
        or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
        water to drink.
020:006 Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to
        the door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces:
        and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.
020:007 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
020:008 Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron
        your brother, and speak you to the rock before their eyes,
        that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them
        water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation
        and their livestock drink.
020:009 Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him.
020:010 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock,
        and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring
        you forth water out of this rock?
020:011 Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice:
        and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank,
        and their livestock.
020:012 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, Because you didn't believe
        in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
        therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land
        which I have given them.
020:013 These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel
        strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.
020:014 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says
        your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has
        happened to us:
020:015 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in
        Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us,
        and our fathers:
020:016 and when we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, and sent
        an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt:  and behold,
        we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.
020:017 Please let us pass through your land:  we will not pass
        through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of
        the water of the wells:  we will go along the king's highway;
        we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left,
        until we have passed your border.
020:018 Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, lest I come
        out with the sword against you.
020:019 The children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway;
        and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give
        the price of it:  let me only, without [doing] anything [else],
        pass through on my feet.
020:020 He said, You shall not pass through.  Edom came out against him
        with much people, and with a strong hand.
020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
        why Israel turned away from him.
020:022 They traveled from Kadesh:  and the children of Israel,
        even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
020:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border
        of the land of Edom, saying,
020:024 Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter
        into the land which I have given to the children of Israel,
        because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
020:026 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son:
        and Aaron shall be gathered [to his people], and shall die there.
020:027 Moses did as Yahweh commanded:  and they went up into Mount Hor
        in the sight of all the congregation.
020:028 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar
        his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain:
        and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
020:029 When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept
        for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
021:001 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South,
        heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim;
        and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
021:002 Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed
        deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
        destroy their cities.
021:003 Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
        the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities:
        and the name of the place was called Hormah.
021:004 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea
        of Reeds}, to compass the land of Edom:  and the soul
        of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
021:005 The people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you
        brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there
        is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes
        this light bread.
021:006 Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people;
        and much people of Israel died.
021:007 The people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
        because we have spoken against Yahweh, and against you;
        pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us.
        Moses prayed for the people.
021:008 Yahweh said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on
        a standard:  and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten,
        when he sees it, shall live.
021:009 Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard:
        and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man,
        when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.
021:010 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.
021:011 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim,
        in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.
021:012 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.
021:013 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side
        of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of
        the border of the Amorites:  for the Arnon is the border of Moab,
        between Moab and the Amorites.
021:014 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh, "Vaheb
        in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,
021:015 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar,
        leans on the border of Moab."
021:016 From there they traveled to Beer:  that is the well of
        which Yahweh said to Moses, Gather the people together,
        and I will give them water.
021:017 Then sang Israel this song:  "Spring up, well; sing to it:
021:018 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of
        the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles."
        From the wilderness [they traveled] to Mattanah;
021:019 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
021:020 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab,
        to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.
021:021 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
021:022 Let me pass through your land:  we will not turn aside into field,
        or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells:
        we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border.
021:023 Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border:
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
        against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz;
        and he fought against Israel.
021:024 Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his
        land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon;
        for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
021:025 Israel took all these cities:  and Israel lived in all the cities
        of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns of it.
021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
        who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken
        all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.
021:027 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon.
        Let the city of Sihon be built and established;
021:028 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon.
        It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places
        of the Arnon.
021:029 Woe to you, Moab!  You are undone, people of Chemosh!  He has
        given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity,
        to Sihon king of the Amorites.
021:030 We have shot at them.  Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.
        We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."
021:031 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
021:032 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns of it,
        and drove out the Amorites who were there.
021:033 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan:  and Og the king
        of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people,
        to battle at Edrei.
021:034 Yahweh said to Moses, Don't fear him:  for I have delivered
        him into your hand, and all his people, and his land;
        and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
        who lived at Heshbon.
021:035 So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there
        was none left him remaining:  and they possessed his land.
022:001 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains
        of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
022:002 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done
        to the Amorites.
022:003 Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:
        and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
022:004 Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick
        up all that is round about us, as the ox licks up the grass
        of the field.  Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab
        at that time.
022:005 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor,
        which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people,
        to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out
        from Egypt:  behold, they cover the surface of the earth,
        and they abide over against me.
022:006 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are
        too mighty for me:  peradventure I shall prevail, that we
        may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land;
        for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom
        you curse is cursed.
022:007 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
        rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam,
        and spoke to him the words of Balak.
022:008 He said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you
        word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me:  and the princes
        of Moab abode with Balaam.
022:009 God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?
022:010 Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
        has sent to me, [saying],
022:011 Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covers
        the surface of the earth:  now, come curse me them;
        peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall
        drive them out.
022:012 God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall
        not curse the people; for they are blessed.
022:013 Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes
        of Balak, Get you into your land; for Yahweh refuses to give
        me leave to go with you.
022:014 The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said,
        Balaam refuses to come with us.
022:015 Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
022:016 They came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son
        of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me:
022:017 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you
        say to me I will do.  Please come therefore, and curse this
        people for me.
022:018 Balaam answered the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me
        his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word
        of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.
022:019 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may
        know what Yahweh will speak to me more.
022:020 God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men are
        come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word
        which I speak to you, that shall you do.
022:021 Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey,
        and went with the princes of Moab.
022:022 God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Yahweh
        placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.
        Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants
        were with him.
022:023 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way,
        with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey
        turned aside out of the way, and went into the field:
        and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.
022:024 Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards,
        a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
022:025 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself
        to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall:
        and he struck her again.
022:026 The angel of Yahweh went further, and stood in a narrow place,
        where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
022:027 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam:
        and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey
        with his staff.
022:028 Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said
        to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me
        these three times?
022:029 Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me, I would
        there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed you.
022:030 The donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you
        have ridden all your life long to this day? was I ever wont
        to do so to you? and he said, No.
022:031 Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
        of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand;
        and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
022:032 The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why have you struck your donkey
        these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary,
        because your way is perverse before me:
022:033 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times:
        unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even
        slain you, and saved her alive.
022:034 Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, I have sinned;
        for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me:
        now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.
022:035 The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only
        the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.
        So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
022:036 When Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him
        to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon,
        which is in the utmost part of the border.
022:037 Balak said to Balaam, Didn't I earnestly send to you to call
        you? why didn't you come to me? am I not able indeed to promote
        you to honor?
022:038 Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you:
        have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word
        that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
022:039 Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.
022:040 Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam,
        and to the princes who were with him.
022:041 It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought
        him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there
        the utmost part of the people.
023:001 Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
        me here seven bulls and seven rams.
023:002 Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
        on every altar a bull and a ram.
023:003 Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go:
        perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me; and whatever he shows
        me I will tell you.  He went to a bare height.
023:004 God met Balaam:  and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars,
        and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
023:005 Yahweh put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak,
        and thus you shall speak.
023:006 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his
        burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
023:007 He took up his parable, and said, From Aram has Balak brought me,
        The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:  Come, curse
        me Jacob, Come, defy Israel.
023:008 How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed?  How shall I defy,
        whom Yahweh has not defied?
023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, From the hills I see him:
        behold, it is a people that dwells alone, And shall not be
        reckoned among the nations.
023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth
        part of Israel?  Let me die the death of the righteous,
        Let my last end be like his!
023:011 Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me?
        I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have
        blessed them altogether.
023:012 He answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which
        Yahweh puts in my mouth?
023:013 Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place,
        from whence you may see them; you shall see but the utmost
        part of them, and shall not see them all:  and curse me
        them from there.
023:014 He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,
        and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram
        on every altar.
023:015 He said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I
        meet [Yahweh] yonder.
023:016 Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,
        Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.
023:017 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering,
        and the princes of Moab with him.  Balak said to him,
        What has Yahweh spoken?
023:018 He took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear!
        Listen to me, you son of Zippor.
023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man,
        that he should repent.  Has he said, and will he not do it?
        Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?
023:020 Behold, I have received a command to bless.  He has blessed,
        and I can't reverse it.
023:021 He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.  Neither has he seen
        perverseness in Israel.  Yahweh his God is with him.
        The shout of a king is among them.
023:022 God brings them out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength
        of the wild ox.
023:023 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there
        any divination with Israel.  Now it shall be said of Jacob
        and of Israel, What has God done!
023:024 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts
        himself up.  He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,
        and drinks the blood of the slain.
023:025 Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
        them at all.
023:026 But Balaam answered Balak, Didn't I tell you, saying, All that
        Yahweh speaks, that I must do?
023:027 Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place;
        peradventure it will please God that you may curse me
        them from there.
023:028 Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down
        on the desert.
023:029 Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
        me here seven bulls and seven rams.
023:030 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram
        on every altar.
024:001 When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel,
        he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments,
        but he set his face toward the wilderness.
024:002 Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according
        to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.
024:003 He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says,
        the man whose eye was closed says;
024:004 he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision
        of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:
024:005 How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your tents, Israel!
024:006 As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the riverside,
        as aloes which Yahweh has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.
024:007 Water shall flow from his buckets.  His seed shall be
        in many waters.  His king shall be higher than Agag.
        His kingdom shall be exalted.
024:008 God brings him out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength
        of the wild ox.  He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,
        shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows.
024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall
        rouse him up?  Everyone who blesses you is blessed.
        Everyone who curses you is cursed.
024:010 Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck
        his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you
        to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed
        them these three times.
024:011 Therefore now flee you to your place:  I thought to promote
        you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you
        back from honor.
024:012 Balaam said to Balak, Didn't I also tell your messengers
        who you sent to me, saying,
024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,
        I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do either good or bad
        of my own mind; what Yahweh speaks, that will I speak?
024:014 Now, behold, I go to my people:  come, [and] I will advertise you
        what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.
024:015 He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says,
        the man whose eye was closed says;
024:016 he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the
        Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down,
        and having his eyes open:
024:017 I see him, but not now.  I see him, but not near.
        A star will come out of Jacob.  A scepter will rise out
        of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab,
        and break down all the sons of Sheth.
024:018 Edom shall be a possession.  Seir, his enemies, also shall
        be a possession, while Israel does valiantly.
024:019 Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy
        the remnant from the city.
024:020 He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,
        Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall
        come to destruction.
024:021 He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,
        Your dwelling place is strong.  Your nest is set in the rock.
024:022 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries
        you away captive.
024:023 He took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when
        God does this?
024:024 But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim.
        They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.
        He also shall come to destruction.
024:025 Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak
        also went his way.
025:001 Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play
        the prostitute with the daughters of Moab:
025:002 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods;
        and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.
025:003 Israel joined himself to Baal Peor:  and the anger of Yahweh
        was kindled against Israel.
025:004 Yahweh said to Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people,
        and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce
        anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.
025:005 Moses said to the judges of Israel, Kill you everyone his men
        who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.
025:006 Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his
        brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in
        the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.
025:007 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
        saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation,
        and took a spear in his hand;
025:008 and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion,
        and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel,
        and the woman through her body.  So the plague was stayed
        from the children of Israel.
025:009 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
025:010 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
        has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel,
        in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I
        didn't consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.
025:012 Therefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:
025:013 and it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant
        of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God,
        and made atonement for the children of Israel.
025:014 Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was
        slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,
        a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.
025:015 The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi,
        the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers'
        house in Midian.
025:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
025:017 Vex the Midianites, and strike them;
025:018 for they vex you with their wiles, with which they have deceived
        you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi,
        the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was
        slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.

        and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers'
        houses, all who are able to go forth to war in Israel.
026:003 Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains
        of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

        that came forth out of the land of Egypt.

026:053 To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according
        to the number of names.
026:054 To the more you shall give the more inheritance,
        and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:
        to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall
        his inheritance be given.
026:055 Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot:
        according to the names of the tribes of their fathers
        they shall inherit.
026:056 According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between
        the more and the fewer.

        who was born to Levi in Egypt:  and she bore to Amram Aaron
        and Moses, and Miriam their sister.
026:060 To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
026:061 Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before Yahweh.
026:062 Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand,
        every male from a month old and upward:  for they were not
        numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no
        inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
026:063 These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest,
        who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab
        by the Jordan at Jericho.
026:064 But among these there was not a man of them who were numbered
        by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children
        of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
026:065 For Yahweh had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness.
        There was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        and Joshua the son of Nun.
027:001 Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher,
        the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
        of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these
        are the names of his daughters:  Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah,
        and Milcah, and Tirzah.
027:002 They stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
        and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door
        of the tent of meeting, saying,
027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among
        the company of those who gathered themselves together against
        Yahweh in the company of Korah:  but he died in his own sin;
        and he had no sons.
027:004 Why should the name of our father be taken away from among
        his family, because he had no son?  Give to us a possession
        among the brothers of our father.
027:005 Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.
027:006 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right:  you shall surely give
        them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers;
        and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to
        pass to them.
027:008 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a man die,
        and have no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass
        to his daughter.
027:009 If he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance
        to his brothers.
027:010 If he have no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance
        to his father's brothers.
027:011 If his father have no brothers, then you shall give his
        inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family,
        and he shall possess it:  and it shall be to the children
        of Israel a statute [and] ordinance, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
027:012 Yahweh said to Moses, Go up into this mountain of Abarim,
        and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.
027:013 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people,
        as Aaron your brother was gathered;
027:014 because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin,
        in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters
        before their eyes.  (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh
        in the wilderness of Zin.)
027:015 Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,
027:016 Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man
        over the congregation,
027:017 who may go out before them, and who may come in before them,
        and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in;
        that the congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which
        have no shepherd.
027:018 Yahweh said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom
        is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;
027:019 and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all
        the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
027:020 You shall put of your honor on him, that all the congregation
        of the children of Israel may obey.
027:021 He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire
        for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh:
        at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall
        come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him,
        even all the congregation.
027:022 Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set
        him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
027:023 and he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as Yahweh
        spoke by Moses.
028:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
028:002 Command the children of Israel, and tell them, My offering,
        my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor to me,
        shall you observe to offer to me in their due season.
028:003 You shall tell them, This is the offering made by fire which you
        shall offer to Yahweh:  male lambs a year old without blemish,
        two day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
028:004 The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb
        shall you offer at even;
028:005 and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering,
        mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai
        for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
028:007 The drink offering of it shall be the fourth part of a hin
        for the one lamb:  in the holy place shall you pour out a drink
        offering of strong drink to Yahweh.
028:008 The other lamb shall you offer at even:  as the meal offering
        of the morning, and as the drink offering of it, you shall
        offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
028:009 On the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish,
        and two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal offering,
        mixed with oil, and the drink offering of it:
028:010 this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual
        burnt offering, and the drink offering of it.
028:011 In the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt
        offering to Yahweh:  two young bulls, and one ram, seven male
        lambs a year old without blemish;
028:012 and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a
        meal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth
        parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil,
        for the one ram;
028:013 and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal
        offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor,
        an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
028:014 Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull,
        and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part
        of a hin for a lamb:  this is the burnt offering of every
        month throughout the months of the year.
028:015 One male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh; it shall be
        offered besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink
        offering of it.
028:016 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month,
        is Yahweh's Passover.
028:017 On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast:
        seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
028:018 In the first day shall be a holy convocation:  you shall
        do no servile work;
028:019 but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering
        to Yahweh:  two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male
        lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;
028:020 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil:
        three tenth parts shall you offer for a bull, and two tenth
        parts for the ram;
028:021 a tenth part shall you offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;
028:022 and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
028:023 You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning,
        which is for a continual burnt offering.
028:024 After this manner you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food
        of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh:
        it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering,

        parts for each bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,

        and their drink offerings.
029:001 In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall

        of a sweet savor to Yahweh:  one bull, one ram, seven male
        lambs a year old without blemish;
029:037 their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bull,
        for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number,
        after the ordinance:
029:038 and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual
        burnt offering, and the meal offering of it, and the drink
        offering of it.
029:039 These you shall offer to Yahweh in your set feasts, besides your vows,
        and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings,
        and for your meal offerings, and for your drink offerings,
        and for your peace offerings.
029:040 Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
        Yahweh commanded Moses.
030:001 Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel,
        saying, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded.
030:002 When a man vows a vow to Yahweh, or swears an oath to bind
        his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall
        do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
030:003 Also when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh, and binds herself
        by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,
030:004 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she
        has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her;
        then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she
        has bound her soul shall stand.
030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears,
        none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound
        her soul, shall stand:  and Yahweh will forgive her,
        because her father disallowed her.
030:006 If she be [married] to a husband, while her vows are on her,
        or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has
        bound her soul,
030:007 and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day
        that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
        with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
030:008 But if her husband disallow her in the day that he hears it,
        then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash
        utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul:
        and Yahweh will forgive her.
030:009 But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced,
        [even] everything with which she has bound her soul,
        shall stand against her.
030:010 If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond
        with an oath,
030:011 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her,
        and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall stand,
        and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
030:012 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he
        heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning
        her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand:
        her husband has made them void; and Yahweh will forgive her.
030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul,
        her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
        to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds,
        which are on her:  he has established them, because he held
        his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
030:015 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has
        heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
030:016 These are the statutes, which Yahweh commanded Moses,
        between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter,
        being in her youth, in her father's house.
031:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites:
        afterward you shall be gathered to your people.
031:003 Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm you men from among you
        for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute
        Yahweh's vengeance on Midian.
031:004 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        shall you send to the war.
031:005 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel,
        a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
031:006 Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war,
        them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
        with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm
        in his hand.
031:007 They warred against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses;
        and they killed every male.
031:008 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain:
        Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five
        kings of Midian:  Balaam also the son of Beor they killed
        with the sword.
031:009 The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their
        little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks,
        and all their goods, they took for a prey.
031:010 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all
        their encampments, they burnt with fire.
031:011 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man
        and of animal.
031:012 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
        to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation
        of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab,
        which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
031:013 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of
        the congregation, went forth to meet them outside of the camp.
031:014 Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains
        of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from
        the service of the war.
031:015 Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?
031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel
        of Balaam, to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor,
        and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.
031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
        every woman who has known man by lying with him.
031:018 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him,
        keep alive for yourselves.
031:019 Encamp you outside of the camp seven days:  whoever has
        killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain,
        purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day,
        you and your captives.
031:020 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin,
        and all work of goats' [hair], and all things made of wood,
        you shall purify yourselves.
031:021 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle,
        This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses:
031:022 however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
        and the lead,
031:023 everything that may abide the fire, you shall make to go
        through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it
        shall be purified with the water for impurity:
        and all that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go
        through the water.
031:024 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall
        be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp.
031:025 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal,
        you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the congregation;
031:027 and divide the prey into two parts:  between the men skilled
        in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
031:028 Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle:
        one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of the oxen,
        and of the donkeys, and of the flocks:
031:029 take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest,
        for Yahweh's wave offering.
031:030 Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out
        of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the donkeys,
        and of the flocks, [even] of all the livestock, and give them
        to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tent of Yahweh.
031:031 Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:032 Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took,
        was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
031:033 and seventy-two thousand oxen,
031:034 and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
031:035 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had
        not known man by lying with him.
031:036 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war,
        was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand
        five hundred sheep:
031:037 and Yahweh's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.
031:038 The oxen were thirty-six thousand; of which Yahweh's
        tribute was seventy-two.
031:039 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which Yahweh's
        tribute was sixty-one.
031:040 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Yahweh's tribute
        was thirty-two persons.
031:041 Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh's wave offering,
        to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:042 Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off
        from the men who warred
031:043 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven
        thousand five hundred sheep,
031:044 and thirty-six thousand oxen,
031:045 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
031:046 and sixteen thousand persons),
031:047 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn
        out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them
        to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tent of Yahweh;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:048 The officers who were over the thousands of the army,
        the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds,
        came near to Moses;
031:049 and they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum
        of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacks
        not one man of us.
031:050 We have brought Yahweh's offering, what every man has gotten,
        of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings,
        and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.
031:051 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,
        even all worked jewels.
031:052 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh,
        of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,
        was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.
031:053 ([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
031:054 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of
        thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting,
        for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh.
032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had
        a very great multitude of livestock:  and when they saw
        the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold,
        the place was a place for livestock;
032:002 the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke
        to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes
        of the congregation, saying,
032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon,
        and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
032:004 the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel,
        is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.
032:005 They said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land
        be given to your servants for a possession; don't bring us
        over the Jordan.
032:006 Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall
        you sit here?
032:007 Why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from
        going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?
032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea
        to see the land.
032:009 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
        they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they
        should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.
032:010 Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,
032:011 Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years
        old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
032:012 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua
        the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Yahweh.
032:013 Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
        them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years,
        until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, was consumed.
032:014 Behold, you are risen up in your fathers' place, an increase
        of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of
        Yahweh toward Israel.
032:015 For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
        them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people.
032:016 They came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
        here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones:
032:017 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children
        of Israel, until we have brought them to their place:
        and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities
        because of the inhabitants of the land.
032:018 We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel
        have inherited every man his inheritance.
032:019 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan,
        and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this
        side of the Jordan eastward.
032:020 Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm
        yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,
032:021 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh,
        until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
032:022 and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you
        shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel;
        and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh.
032:023 But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh;
        and be sure your sin will find you out.
032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;
        and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.
032:025 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses,
        saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.
032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock,
        shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
032:027 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war,
        before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.
032:028 So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest,
        and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel.
032:029 Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children
        of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man
        who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land shall
        be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land
        of Gilead for a possession:
032:030 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall
        have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
032:031 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying,
        As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.
032:032 We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan,
        and the possession of our inheritance [shall remain] with us
        beyond the Jordan.
032:033 Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph,
        the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities of it
        with [their] borders, even the cities of the land round about.
032:034 The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
032:035 and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,
032:036 and Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran:  fortified cities,
        and folds for sheep.
032:037 The children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,
032:038 and Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah:
        and they gave other names to the cities which they built.
032:039 The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
        and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.
032:040 Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh;
        and he lived therein.
032:041 Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns of it,
        and called them Havvoth Jair.
032:042 Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages of it, and called
        it Nobah, after his own name.
033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they
        went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under
        the hand of Moses and Aaron.
033:002 Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
        by the commandment of Yahweh:  and these are their journeys
        according to their goings out.
033:003 They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth
        day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover
        the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight
        of all the Egyptians,
033:004 while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn,
        whom Yahweh had struck among them:  on their gods also
        Yahweh executed judgments.
033:005 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses, and encamped
        in Succoth.
033:006 They traveled from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is
        in the edge of the wilderness.
033:007 They traveled from Etham, and turned back to Pihahiroth,
        which is before Baal Zephon:  and they encamped before Migdol.
033:008 They traveled from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst
        of the sea into the wilderness:  and they went three days'
        journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.
033:009 They traveled from Marah, and came to Elim:  and in Elim
        were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees;
        and they encamped there.
033:010 They traveled from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea{or, Sea of
        Reeds}.
033:011 They traveled from the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, and encamped
        in the wilderness of Sin.
033:012 They traveled from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.
033:013 They traveled from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.
033:014 They traveled from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim, where was
        no water for the people to drink.
033:015 They traveled from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.
033:016 They traveled from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped
        in Kibroth Hattaavah.
033:017 They traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth.
033:018 They traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.
033:019 They traveled from Rithmah, and encamped in Rimmon Perez.
033:020 They traveled from Rimmon Perez, and encamped in Libnah.
033:021 They traveled from Libnah, and encamped in Rissah.
033:022 They traveled from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.
033:023 They traveled from Kehelathah, and encamped in Mount Shepher.
033:024 They traveled from Mount Shepher, and encamped in Haradah.
033:025 They traveled from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.
033:026 They traveled from Makheloth, and encamped in Tahath.
033:027 They traveled from Tahath, and encamped in Terah.
033:028 They traveled from Terah, and encamped in Mithkah.
033:029 They traveled from Mithkah, and encamped in Hashmonah.
033:030 They traveled from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.
033:031 They traveled from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene Jaakan.
033:032 They traveled from Bene Jaakan, and encamped in Hor Haggidgad.
033:033 They traveled from Hor Haggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.
033:034 They traveled from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.
033:035 They traveled from Abronah, and encamped in Ezion Geber.
033:036 They traveled from Ezion Geber, and encamped in the wilderness
        of Zin (the same is Kadesh).
033:037 They traveled from Kadesh, and encamped in Mount Hor,
        in the edge of the land of Edom.
033:038 Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment
        of Yahweh, and died there, in the fortieth year after
        the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
        in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
033:039 Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died
        in Mount Hor.
033:040 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South in the land
        of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
033:041 They traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.
033:042 They traveled from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.
033:043 They traveled from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.
033:044 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped in Iye Abarim,
        in the border of Moab.
033:045 They traveled from Iyim, and encamped in Dibon Gad.
033:046 They traveled from Dibon Gad, and encamped in Almon Diblathaim.
033:047 They traveled from Almon Diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains
        of Abarim, before Nebo.
033:048 They traveled from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped
        in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
033:049 They encamped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to
        Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.
033:050 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan
        at Jericho, saying,
033:051 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass
        over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
033:052 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land
        from before you, and destroy all their figured [stones],
        and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all
        their high places:
033:053 and you shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein;
        for to you have I given the land to possess it.
033:054 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families;
        to the more you shall give the more inheritance,
        and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:
        wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his;
        according to the tribes of your fathers shall you inherit.
033:055 But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land
        from before you, then shall those who you let remain of them
        be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides,
        and they shall vex you in the land in which you dwell.
033:056 It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I
        do to you.
034:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
034:002 Command the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come
        into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall
        to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according
        to the borders of it),
034:003 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin
        along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be
        from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;
034:004 and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent
        of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out of it
        shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go forth
        to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon;
034:005 and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt,
        and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
034:006 For the western border, you shall have the great sea and
        the border [of it]: this shall be your west border.
034:007 This shall be your north border:  from the great sea you shall
        mark out for you Mount Hor;
034:008 from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath;
        and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;
034:009 and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it
        shall be at Hazar Enan:  this shall be your north border.
034:010 You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;
034:011 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah,
        on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down,
        and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;
034:012 and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings
        out of it shall be at the Salt Sea.  This shall be your land
        according to the borders of it round about.
034:013 Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land
        which you shall inherit by lot, which Yahweh has commanded
        to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;
034:014 for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers'
        houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according
        to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:
034:015 the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance
        beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.
034:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
034:017 These are the names of the men who shall divide the land
        to you for inheritance:  Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
        the son of Nun.
034:018 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide
        the land for inheritance.
034:019 These are the names of the men:  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the
        son of Jephunneh.
034:020 Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
034:022 Of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the
        son of Jogli.
034:023 Of the children of Joseph:  of the tribe of the children
        of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
034:024 Of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the
        son of Shiphtan.
034:025 Of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the
        son of Parnach.
034:026 Of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince,
        Paltiel the son of Azzan.
034:027 Of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the
        son of Shelomi.
034:028 Of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince,
        Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
034:029 These are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance
        to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
035:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan
        at Jericho, saying,
035:002 Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites
        of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in;
        and suburbs for the cities round about them shall you give
        to the Levites.
035:003 The cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs
        shall be for their livestock, and for their substance,
        and for all their animals.
035:004 The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites,
        shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand
        cubits round about.
035:005 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two
        thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits,
        and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north
        side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst.
        This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
035:006 The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six
        cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to:
        and besides them you shall give forty-two cities.
035:007 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be
        forty-eight cities; them [shall you give] with their suburbs.
035:008 Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession
        of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many;
        and from the few you shall take few:  everyone according
        to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities
        to the Levites.
035:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
035:010 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass
        over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
035:011 then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge
        for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly
        may flee there.
035:012 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger,
        that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the
        congregation for judgment.
035:013 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six
        cities of refuge.
035:014 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three
        cities shall you give in the land of Canaan; they shall
        be cities of refuge.
035:015 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner
        living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge;
        that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
035:016 But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died,
        he is a murderer:  the murderer shall surely be put to death.
035:017 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die,
        and he died, he is a murderer:  the murderer shall surely
        be put to death.
035:018 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand,
        by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer:
        the murderer shall surely be put to death.
035:019 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death:
        when he meets him, he shall put him to death.
035:020 If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait,
        so that he died,
035:021 or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died;
        he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer:
        the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death,
        when he meets him.
035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him
        anything without lying in wait,
035:023 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him,
        and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy,
        neither sought his harm;
035:024 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and
        the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;
035:025 and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of
        the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall
        restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled:
        and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest,
        who was anointed with the holy oil.
035:026 But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border
        of his city of refuge, where he flees,
035:027 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his
        city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer;
        he shall not be guilty of blood,
035:028 because he should have remained in his city of refuge
        until the death of the high priest:  but after the death
        of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land
        of his possession.
035:029 These things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance to you
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
035:030 Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at
        the mouth of witnesses:  but one witness shall not testify
        against any person that he die.
035:031 Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer
        who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
035:032 You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city
        of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land,
        until the death of the priest.
035:033 So you shall not pollute the land in which you are:
        for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can
        be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein,
        but by the blood of him who shed it.
035:034 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst
        of which I dwell:  for I, Yahweh, dwell in the midst of
        the children of Israel.
036:001 The heads of the fathers' [houses] of the family of the
        children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
        of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke
        before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the children of Israel:
036:002 and they said, Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land
        for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel:
        and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance
        of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
036:003 If they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes
        of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken
        away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added
        to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong:
        so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
036:004 When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will
        their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe
        whereunto they shall belong:  so will their inheritance be
        taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
036:005 Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word
        of Yahweh, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right.
036:006 This is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning
        the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married
        to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe
        of their father shall they be married.
036:007 So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove
        from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave
        everyone to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
036:008 Every daughter, who possesses an inheritance in any tribe
        of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family
        of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may
        possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
036:009 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe;
        for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave everyone
        to his own inheritance.
036:010 Even as Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
036:011 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters
        of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.
036:012 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh
        the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe
        of the family of their father.
036:013 These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh
        commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains
        of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
