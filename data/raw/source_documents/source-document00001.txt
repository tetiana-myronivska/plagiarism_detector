 Oh, can't you? Simplest thing in the world--any child
could do it!

_Second Lady_. What, find the rabbit inside those boxes, when they
were all corded up, and sealed!

_The M. in E.D_. You don't mean to say you were taken in by _that_?
Why, it was another rabbit, of course!

_First Lady_. But even if it _was_ another rabbit, it was wearing the
borrowed watch round its neck.

_The M. in E. D_. Easy enough to slip the watch in, if all the boxes
have false bottoms.

_Second L_. Yes, but he passed the boxes round for us to examine.

_The M. in E. D_. Boxes--but not _those_ boxes.

_First L_. But how could he slip the watch in when somebody was
holding it all the time in a paper bag?

_The M. in E. D_. Ah, _I_ saw how it was done--but it would take too
long to explain it now. I _have_ seen it so well performed that you
_couldn't_ spot it. But this chap's a regular duffer!

_Herr V. K. (who finds this sort of thing rather disturbing_). Lyties
and Shentilmans, I see zere is von among us who is a brofessional like
myself, and knows how all my leedle dricks is done. Now--_suddenly
abandoning his accent_--I am always griteful for hanythink that will
distrack the attention of the orjonce from what is going on upon the
Stige; naterally so, because it prevents you from follerin' my actions
too closely, and so I now call upon this gentleman in the hevenin'
dress jest to speak hup a very little louder than what he 'as
been doin', so that you will be enabled to 'ear hevery word of his
hexplanation more puffickly than what some of you in the back benches
have done 'itherto. Now, Sir, if you'll kindly repeat your very
hinterestin' remarks in a more haudible tone, I can go on between
like. [_Murmurs of "No, no!" "Shut up!" "We don't want to hear him!"
from various places_; The Man in Evening Dress _subsides into a
crimson taciturnity, which continues during the remainder of the
performance_.
