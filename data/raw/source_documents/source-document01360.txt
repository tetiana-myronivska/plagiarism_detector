  PART I

  PUPPYHOOD


  _"What other nature yours than of a child
  Whose dumbness finds a voice mighty to call,
  In wordless pity, to the souls of all,
  Whose lives I turn to profit, and whose mute
  And constant friendship links the man and brute?"_


  THE DOG'S BOOK OF VERSE

  WE MEET AT MORN


  Still half in dream, upon the stair I hear
  A patter coming nearer and more near,
  And then upon my chamber door
  A gentle tapping,
  For dogs, though proud, are poor,
  And if a tail will do to give command
  Why use a hand?
  And after that a cry, half sneeze, half yapping,
  And next a scuffle on the passage floor,
  And then I know the creature lies to watch
  Until the noiseless maid will lift the latch.
  And like a spring
  That gains its power by being tightly stayed,
  The impatient thing
  Into the room
  Its whole glad heart doth fling,
  And ere the gloom
  Melts into light, and window blinds are rolled,
  I hear a bounce upon the bed,
  I feel a creeping toward me--a soft head,
  And on my face
  A tender nose, and cold--
  This is the way, you know, that dogs embrace--
  And on my hand, like sun-warmed rose-leaves flung,
  The least faint flicker of the warmest tongue
  --And so my dog and I have met and sworn
  Fresh love and fealty for another morn.

    HARDWICKE DRUMMOND RAWNSLEY.


  THE LOST PUPPY


  Say! little pup,
      What's up?
  Your tail is down
    And out of sight
  Between your legs;
    Why, that ain't right.
      Little pup,
        Brace up!

  Say! little pup,
      Look up!
  Don't hang your head
    And look so sad,
  You're all mussed up,
    But you ain't mad.
      Little pup,
        Cheer up!

  Say! little pup,
      Stir up!
  Is that a string
    Around your tail?
  And was it fast
    To a tin pail?
      Little pup,
        Git up.

  Say! little pup,
      Talk up.
  Were those bad boys
    All after you,
  With sticks and stones,
    And tin cans, too?
      Little pup,
        Speak up!

  Say! little pup,
      Stand up!
  Let's look at you;
    You'd be all right
  If you was scrubbed
    And shined up bright.
      Little pup,
        Jump up!

  Say! little pup,
      Bark up!
  Let's hear your voice.
    Say, you're a brick!
  Now try to beg
    And do a trick.
      Little pup,
        Sit up!

  Say! little pup,
      Chime up!
  Why, you can sing--
    Now come with me;
  Let's wash and eat
    And then we'll see,
      Little pup,
        What's up!

    HENRY FIRTH WOOD.


  A LAUGH IN CHURCH


  She sat on the sliding cushion,
  The dear, wee woman of four;
  Her feet, in their shiny slippers,
  Hung dangling over the floor.
  She meant to be good; she had promised,
  And so with her big, brown eyes,
  She stared at the meetinghouse windows
  And counted the crawling flies.

  She looked far up at the preacher,
  But she thought of the honeybees
  Droning away at the blossoms
  That whitened the cherry trees.
  She thought of a broken basket,
  Where curled in a dusky heap,
  Four sleek, round puppies, with fringy ears.
  Lay snuggled and fast asleep.
