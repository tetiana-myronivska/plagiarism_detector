On the banks of Allan Water,
  When the Winter snow fell fast,
Still was seen the miller's daughter,
  Chilling blew the blast.
But the miller's lovely daughter,
  Both from cold and care was free:
On the banks of Allan Water,
  There a corpse lay she.

AULD LANG SYNE.


Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
  And never brought to min'?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
  And days o' auld lang syne?

        CHORUS.
For auld lang syne, my dear,
  For auld lang syne,
We'll tak' a cup' o' kindness yet,
  For auld lang syne.

We twa hae run about the braes,
  And pu'd the gowans fine;
But we've wandered mony a weary foot
  Sin auld lang syne.
        For auld, etc.

We twa hae paidl't i' the burn,
  From mornin' sun till dine;
But seas between us braid hae roar'd
  Sin auld lang syne.
        For auld, etc.

And here's a hand, my trusty frien',
  And gie's a hand o' thine;
And we'll tak a right guid-willie waught,
  For auld lang syne.
        For auld, etc.

And surely ye'll be your pint-stoup,
  And surely I'll be mine;
And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet
  For auld lang syne.
        For auld, etc.

        _Burns._


WITHIN A MILE OF EDINBURGH TOWN.


'Twas within a mile of Edinburgh town,
    In the rosy time of the year;
Sweet flowers bloom'd,
          and the grass was down,
  And each shepherd woo'd his dear.
    Bonnie Jocky, blythe and gay,
    Kiss'd sweet Jenny making hay:
The lassie blush'd, and frowning cried,
      "No, no, it will not do;
I canna, canna, wonna, wonna,
              manna buckle to."

Jocky was a wag that never would wed,
  Though long he had follow'd the lass:
Contented she earn'd
          and eat her brown bread,
  And merrily turn'd up the grass.
    Bonnie Jocky, blythe and free,
    Won her heart right merrily:
Yet still she blush'd, and frowning cried,
      "No, no, it will not do;
I canna, canna, wonna, wonna,
              manna buckle to."

But when he vow'd he would
          make her his bride,
  Though his flocks and herds
                were not few,
She gave him her hand, and a kiss beside,
  And vow'd she'd for ever be true.
    Bonnie Jocky, blythe and free,
    Won her heart right merrily:
At church she no more frowning cried,
      "No, no, it will not do;
I canna, canna, wonna, wonna,
              manna buckle to."

        _Anon._


THE NIGHT-PIECE TO JULIA.


Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,
The shooting stars attend thee;
  And the elves also,
  Whose little eyes glow,
Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.

No Will-o'-th'-Wisp mislight thee,
Nor snake or slow-worm bite thee;
  But on, on thy way,
  Not making a stay,
Since ghost there's none to affright thee.

Let not the dark thee cumber;
What though the moon does slumber?
  The stars of the night
  Will lend thee their light,
Like tapers clear, without number.

Then, Julia, let me woo thee,
Thus, thus to come unto me;
  And when I shall meet
  Thy silv'ry feet,
My soul I'll pour into thee.

        _Herrick_.


TOM BOWLING.


Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling,
  The darling of our crew;
No more he'll hear the tempest howling,
  For death has broach'd him to.
His form was of the manliest beauty,
  His heart was kind and soft;
Faithful below he did his duty.
  But now he's gone aloft.

Tom never from his word departed,
  His virtues were so rare;
His friends were many and true-hearted,
  His Poll was kind and fair:
And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly;
  Ah, many's the time and oft!
But mirth is turn'd to melancholy,
  For Tom is gone aloft.

Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather,
  When He who all commands,
Shall give, to call life's crew together,
  The word to pipe all hands.
Thus Death, who kings and tars dispatches,
  In vain Tom's life has doff'd;
For though his body's under hatches,
  His soul is gone aloft.

        _Charles Dibdin._
