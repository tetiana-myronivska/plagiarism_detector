BABY'S TEN LITTLE LIVE PLAYTHINGS BY J. K. BARRY

These ten little live playthings can be held in every baby's hand, five
in one and five in the other and be the baby ever so poor yet he always
has these ten playthings because, you know, he brings them with him.

But all babies do not know how to play with them. They find out for
themselves a good many ways of playing with them but here are some of
the ways that a baby I used to know got amusement out of his.

The very first was the play called "Ta-ra-chese" (Ta-rar-cheese). It is
a Dutch word and there was a little song about it all in Dutch. This is
the way the baby I knew would play it when he was a tiny little fellow.
