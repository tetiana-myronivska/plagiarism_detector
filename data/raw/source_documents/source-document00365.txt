    "Let us buy,"
    Said Sally Fry,
    "Something nice,"
    Said Betsy Price.
    "What shall it be,"
    Said Kitty Lee,
    "A nice plum cake,"
    Said Lucy Wake.


    [Illustration]

    Which will you have, the doll, or Noah's Ark? said
    mother to Mary one day.

    The doll, if you please, I think I will take, for
    then I can prettily play.


    [Illustration]

    One day John said, as he made his bow,
    "Mamma, are you at leisure now?
    Tell me, for much I wish to know,
    Tell me, do pins and needles grow?"


    [Illustration]

    With a bound, see the ball go,
    Now high in the air as hit it just so.
    No catch is Jo.; oh, how he lingers,
    He'll soon have the name of old butter fingers.


    [Illustration]

    Oh, what a pretty butterfly,
    How beautiful its wings,
    How quick it flies! now low, now high,
    From flower to flower it springs.


    [Illustration]

    Oh, bless me, Mary, how is this?
    Your hands are very dirty, Miss,
    I don't expect such hands to see,
    When you come in to dine with me.


    [Illustration]

    Said good Mamma, "My Harry dear,
    'Tis nine o'clock, and school time's near,
    Go comb your hair, and fetch your book,
    And go to school with pleasant look."


    [Illustration]

    Hear me, my dear little son,
    Go slow, and do not run,
    Do you always make a rule,
    To come straight home from school;
    Try to learn your lessons well,
    That you may learn to read and spell.
