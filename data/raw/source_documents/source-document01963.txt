  Now Law, the Old Antic, seems utterly frantic, absurdly romantic and
      maundering;
  And Cool Common Sense has gone dotty and dense, in dim deserts of
      Sentiment wandering.
  Now Reason and Right, hydrocephalous quite, are both Della-Cruscan and
      drivelling,
  Life (barring the fun) like "The Mulberry One," seems a mixture of
      diddling and snivelling.
  There's LAWSON who jaws on the Abstinence Cause on, and would lay his
      claws on the Nation,
  And put sudden stopper on all that's improper (as _he_ thinks) without
      compensation;
  And then there's Sir EDWARD, who, when he goes bedward, must have _his_
      reflections nightmarish!
  It seems, from such rigs, that our biggest Big Wigs are scarcest to
      govern a parish.
  MCDOUGALL again, is agog to restrain all that gives _his_ soul pain--it's
      a squeamish one!--
  He thinks he's a stayer as Jabberwock-slayer, mere Angry Boy he, _not_ a
      Beamish One!
  These Oracles windy do raise such a shindy, and kick such a doose of a
      dust up,
  One would think without _them_ we were wrong stern and stem, and the whole
      of creation would bust up.
  But verily why men should _new_ worship Hymen,--who, just as unshackled as
      Cupid,--
  (See decision _Re_ JACKSON), take burdens their backs on, I can_not_
      conceive. It seems stupid
  Beyond all expression to have a "possession" whose "ownness" there's
      desperate doubt of,
  And which (if she's _nous_) you can't keep _in_ your house, nor yet (if
      she's "savvy") keep _out_ of!
  What _is_ "Hymen's halter"? I fidget and falter! The Beaks seem to palter
      and fumble.
  In such a strange fashion, I fly in a passion, and vow that the world is a
      jumble.
  Law seems a wigged noodle, as tame as a poodle, the whole darned caboodle
      (as 'ARRY sees)
  Is ructions and "rot," and our "rulers" a lot of confounded old foodles
      and Pharisees!
  Yes, that's what _I_ think about Marriage and Drink--if you may call it
      thought, which with frenzy is fraught, and gives me a "head" like bad
      whiskey; whose dread is on me day and night, makes me wake in a fright,
      from visions most solemn of column on column of such "printed matter"
      and paragraph chatter, as makes me feel flatter than cold eggless batter
      upon a lead platter--as mad as a hatter, and who will relieve me? Can anyone?
  I tell you it's dreadful to face a whole bedful of spectres and spooks (born
      of papers and books) with, most horrible looks, limbs contorted in crooks,
      and bat-wings with big hooks, which haunt all the nooks of tester and
      curtain, and which, I am certain, will drive me insane if _some_ one can't
      explain where the mischief we are, 'midst the jumble and jar of factions
      and fads, of crotchets and cads, of Tolstois and Jeunes, and Ibsens (whose
      lunes are more lunatic still). Oh, I'd learn with a will from any or aught,
      who could bring me, fresh caught, with lucidity fraught (what so long I have
      sought) a Clear Comforting Thought--though a Penny One!
