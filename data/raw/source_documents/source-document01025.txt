Introduction.


  Here are Tot, Tom and Toby:
    There are lots of things to see;
  There are dogs and cats and horses and goats,
    As happy as they can be.

  Turn the leaves gently. The dogs and the cats,
    And the little children, too,
  Will be hurt if you tear them. How would you feel
    If any one tore up you?


"FLY LITTLE BIRD AWAY."

[Illustration]

  A lit-tle girl
  Read in her book,
  How a wick-ed boy
  A wild bird took
  From out its nest
  In the green-wood tree
  A cap-tive now
  'Tis forced to be,
  And flutters its poor wings all day long,
  And beats the bars of its cage so strong.

[Illustration]

  "Poor lit-tle bird!"
  She soft-ly cried;
  Then on her head
  Her hood she tied,
  Took down the cage
  Of her own bird,
  Opened the door,
  With joy-ous word.
  "Fly, lit-tle bird, a-way," quoth she,
  Back to your home in the green-wood tree.

[Illustration]

  A-way, a-way,
  The glad bird flew,
  Far out of sight,
  In heav-ens blue.
  The wee girl watched
  With won-der-ing eye,
  Till it had fad-ed
  In the sky,
  Then sat her down, and cried, "Boo-hoo!
  My bird is gone! What shall I do?"

[Illustration]

  Her pin-a-fore
  With tears was wet:
  "My bird a-gain,
  I'll nev-er get."
  At last she raised
  Her weep-ing eye,
  And there at hand,
  What should she spy
  But bird-ie hop-ping in his door,
  Tired of his free-dom, back once more.


MAY DAY.

[Illustration]

  One day, all in the sweet spring weather,
  Two lit-tle folk went out to-geth-er.
    Oh the bright May-day!
  Sun was shining, birds were sing-ing,
  Flow-ers bloom-ing, May-bells ring-ing!
    Oh the glad May-day!

  So they two went forth a May-ing,
  Laugh-ing, dan-cing, sing-ing, say-ing
    "Oh the bright May-day!
  What care we for moth-er's warn-ing?
  Who would bide at home this morn-ing?
    Oh the glad May-day!"


HI DIDDLE, DIDDLE!

[Illustration]

  Hi! Diddle, Diddle!
  The Cat and the Fiddle!
  The Cow jumped over the Moon.

[Illustration]

  The Little Dog laughed to see such sport,
  And the Dish ran away with the Spoon.

JACK AND JILL.

These are Jack and Jill. Do you not see their pail? They fill it with
salt wa-ter.

[Illustration]

"What a sweet lit-tle lamb!" said May. "No: it is a wolf. I must run:
he will eat me."


DOLL AND I.


[Illustration]

  "Oh, dear! On, dear!
  'Tis al-most nine.
  The birds all sing,
  The sun does shine.
  Poor Doll and I
  To school must go:
  I don't see why,
  We hate it so.
  I hate those let-ters. They twist and turn.
  There's no use try-ing: I'll nev-er learn.

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration]

  "Hur-rah! hur-rah!
  At last it's two!
  I am so glad!
  What shall we do?
  Come, Doll, let's run.
  I'll nev-er go,
  When I get big,
  To school, I know;
  But ev-er-y min-ute of the day
  I'll spend just as I like, in play."


THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT.


[Illustration]

"Hold it tight, Tom, dear," said May. "Mam-ma will be pleased at her
birth-day gift. I think it is just love-ly." But the words were not out
of her mouth when Tom caught his foot and fell at full length on the
car-pet. Crash! went the vase that was to have been mam-ma's pres-ent
in-to bits.

May burst in-to tears, but she stopped all at once when she saw that Tom
did not get up, and that his face was grow-ing ve-ry white. "Oh! Tom,"
she cried, "is a-ny-thing the matter?"

"My knee," groaned Tom, "it hurts aw-ful-ly."

[Illustration]

May ran at once for pa-pa. He came, and Tom was lift-ed up and put to
bed, and the doc-tor was sent for. It was found that his knee was bad-ly
hurt, and that he must not get out of bed for a month. Hard work it was
for Tom, but May stayed by him all the time, and at the month's end he
was well a-gain.

ROVER PASSES BY.

[Illustration: IN DANGER.]

  A scared little couple,
    Fright in each eye!
  O what is the matter?
    A dog passes by!
      Bow-wow!

  I'm sure 'tis a big dog,
    Or kitty'd not hide,
  And her brave little mistress
    So nearly have cried!
      Bow-wow!


"THE SEA FOAM"


One bright spring day Tom got out his new sail-boat, "The Sea Foam."
Dol-ly went with him, and they set out for the pond. They had but just
put the boat in the wa-ter, when they saw their cous-in Grace. She had
a doll in her arms, which she was car-ry-ing with great care; and she
had her eyes on the ground as she walked a-long.
