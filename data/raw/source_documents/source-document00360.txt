Economy Indonesia


Economy - overview:
  Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, has struggled to overcome the
  Asian financial crisis, and still grapples with high unemployment, a
  fragile banking sector, endemic corruption, inadequate
  infrastructure, a poor investment climate, and unequal resource
  distribution among regions. Indonesia became a net oil importer in
  2004 because of declining production and lack of new exploration
  investment. In late December 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami took
  131,000 lives with another 37,000 missing, left some 570,000
  displaced persons, and caused an estimated $4.5 billion in damages
  and losses. The cost of subsidizing domestic fuel placed increasing
  strain on the budget in 2005, and combined with indecisive monetary
  policy, contributed to a run on the currency in August 2005,
  prompting the government to enact a 126% average fuel price hike in
  October. The resulting inflation and interest rate hikes dampened
  growth prospects in 2006. However, in October 2006, Jakarta paid off
  its outstanding IMF debt, incurred during the 1997-98 Asian
  financial crisis, four years ahead of schedule. Keys to future
  growth remain internal reform, building up the confidence of
  international and domestic investors, and strong global economic
  growth.

Transnational Issues Indonesia


Disputes - international:
  East Timor-Indonesia Boundary Committee continues to meet, survey,
  and delimit land boundary, but several sections of the boundary
  remain unresolved; many East Timorese refugees who left in 2003
  still reside in Indonesia and refuse repatriation; Indonesia and
  East Timor contest the sovereignty of the uninhabited coral island
  of Pulau Batek/Fatu Sinai, which hinders a decision on a northern
  maritime boundary; a 1997 treaty between Indonesia and Australia
  settled some parts of their maritime boundary but outstanding issues
  remain; ICJ's award of Sipadan and Ligitan islands to Malaysia in
  2002 left maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Celebes Sea in
  dispute, culminating in hostile confrontations in March 2005 over
  concessions to the Ambalat oil block; the ICJ decision has prompted
  Indonesia to assert claims to and to establish a presence on its
  smaller outer islands; Indonesia and Singapore pledged in 2005 to
  finalize their 1973 maritime boundary agreement by defining
  unresolved areas north of Batam Island; Indonesian secessionists,
  squatters, and illegal migrants create repatriation problems for
  Papua New Guinea; piracy remains a problem in the Malacca Strait

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  IDPs: 570,000 (resulting from 26 December 2004 tsunami) 500,000
