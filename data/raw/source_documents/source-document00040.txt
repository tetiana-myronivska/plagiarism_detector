Economy

Economy - overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and
technologically advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GDP
of $28,600, the largest among major industrial nations. In this
market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make
most of the decisions, and government buys needed goods and services
predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy
considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay off surplus
workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they face higher
barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the barriers to
entry of foreign firms in US markets. In all economic sectors, US
firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances,
especially in computers, and medical, aerospace, and military
equipment, although their advantage has narrowed since the end of
World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual
development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the bottom
lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at
the top and, more and more, fail to get pay raises, health insurance
coverage, and other benefits. The years 1994-96 witnessed moderate
gains in real output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment
below 6%. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic
infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,
sizable budget and trade deficits, and stagnation of family income in
the lower economic groups. The outlook for 1997 is for continued
moderate growth, low inflation, and about the same level of
unemployment.

Economy

Economy - overview: Uruguay's small economy benefits from a favorable
climate for agriculture and substantial hydropower potential. Economic
development has been restrained in recent years by high - though
declining - inflation and extensive government regulation. The
SANGUINETTI government's conservative monetary and fiscal policies are
aimed at continuing to reduce inflation, at 24.3% at yearend 1996;
other priorities include extensive reform of the social security
system and increased investment in education. Uruguay recovered from
recession in 1996 - partly due to the recovery in Argentina - and
ended the year with a nearly 5% rise in GDP. Uruguayan trade continued
to expand and the potential for new markets continued to open through
the negotiations of Mercosur (Southern Cone Common Market) with
neighboring countries and the European Union (EU). The economy is
expected to continue growing at a healthy rate in 1997 along with
other regional economies.

Economy

Economy - overview: Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which
10% consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It was
one of the poorest areas of the former Soviet Union with more than 60%
of its population living in overpopulated rural communities.
Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major
producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally significant
producer of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in
December 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style
command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and
prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however, the government
stepped up the pace of reform in mid-1994, by introducing tighter
monetary policies, expanding privatization, slightly reducing the role
of the state in the economy, and improving the environment for foreign
investors. Nevertheless, the state continues to be a dominating
influence in the economy, and reforms have so far failed to bring
about much-needed structural changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's
$185 million standby arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental
steps that made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based primarily on subsistence or
small-scale agriculture which provides a living for 65% of the
population. Fishing and tourism are the other mainstays of the
economy, with 43,000 visitors in 1992. Mineral deposits are
negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light
industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly
from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on
relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters,
and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands.

Economy

Economy - overview: The petroleum sector dominates the economy,
accounting for roughly 25% of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and 50% of
central government revenues. It is likely to become even more
important as the state petroleum company plans to double its
production over the next ten years. The non-petroleum sectors have
been contracting, however, with GDP shrinking by 1.6% during 1996.
Realizing the failure of interventionist policies, the CALDERA
administration embarked on a comprehensive reform program and
successfully negotiated a $1.4 billion stand-by agreement with the
IMF. The state eliminated price and exchange controls, reduced the
long-standing subsidy on gasoline, and revitalized its stalled
privatization program. Foreign investors reacted positively and the
Caracas stock exchange ended 1996 as the world's best performing stock
market. The influx of foreign investment and a windfall of oil
revenues resulting from higher-than-expected international oil prices
raised Venezuela's reserves to over $15 billion. As a result,
Venezuela used only the first tranche of the IMF credit - $400
million. The currency depreciated sharply following the exchange
liberalization, and caused an inflationary burst that led to a 103%
yearly rate of inflation, the highest in Venezuelan history. The
bolivar has since strengthened and inflation fell near the end of the
year. The macroeconomic adjustments should take hold in 1997, and the
economy is expected to grow by 4% or more. Increased salary demands by
public and private sector workers, however, threaten a renewal of
inflationary pressures.

Economy

Economy - overview: Vietnam is a poor, densely populated country that
has had to recover from the ravages of war, the loss of financial
support from the old Soviet Bloc, and the rigidities of a centrally
planned economy. Substantial progress has been achieved over the past
10 years in moving forward from an extremely low starting point.
Economic growth continued at a strong pace during 1996 with industrial
output rising by 14% and real GDP expanding by 9.4%. Foreign direct
investment rose to an estimated $2.3 billion for the year, up by about
30% from 1995. These positive numbers, however, masked some major
difficulties that are emerging in economic performance. Many domestic
industries, including coal, cement, steel, and paper, reported large
stockpiles of inventory and tough competition from more efficient
foreign producers. Vietnam's trade deficit widened to $4 billion in
1996, up over 80% from a year ago. While disbursements of aid and
foreign direct investment have risen, they are not large enough to
finance the rapid increase in imports and it is widely believed that
Vietnam may be using short-term trade credits to bridge the gap - a
risky strategy that could result in a foreign exchange crunch during
1997. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities continue to move very slowly
toward implementing the structural reforms needed to revitalize the
economy and produce more competitive, export-driven industries.
Privatization of state enterprises remains bogged down in political
controversy, while the country's dynamic private sector is denied both
financing and access to markets. Reform of the banking sector is
proceeding slowly, raising concerns that the country will be unable to
tap sufficient domestic savings to maintain current high levels of
growth. Administrative and legal barriers are also causing costly
delays for foreign investors and are raising similar doubts about
Vietnam's ability to maintain the inflow of foreign capital.
Ideological bias in favor of state intervention and control of the
economy is slowing progress toward a more liberalized investment
environment.

Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism is the primary economic activity,
accounting for more than 70% of GDP and 70% of employment. The number
of US tourists in the first five months of 1996 was down by 55% from
the same period in 1995, the lingering result of the fierce hurricanes
of 1995. Unemployment rose sharply in 1996. The manufacturing sector
consists of textile, electronics, pharmaceutical, and watch assembly
plants. The agricultural sector is small, most food being imported.
International business and financial services are a small but growing
component of the economy. One of the world's largest petroleum
refineries is at Saint Croix. A major economic problem at the
beginning of 1997 was the more than $1 billion in governmental
arrears, in income tax refunds, payments to vendors, and overdue
wages.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is limited to traditional subsistence
agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood
from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs),
and fishing. About 4% of the population is employed in government.
Revenues come from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing
rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from
expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and Futuna imports food -
particularly sugar, rice, and beef - fuel, clothing, machinery, and
transport equipment, but its exports are negligible, consisting of
copra and handicrafts.

WEST BANK

Introduction

Current issues: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996. Under
the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities
to the Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative
Council elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing
arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and
responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place
pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza
Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank
pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement. The
DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the
transitional period for external security and for internal security
and public order of settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to
be determined through direct negotiations which began on 5 May 1996.

Economy

Economy - overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been
hampered by tight Israeli security restrictions. Industries using
advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have been
discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing,
not productive assets that would enable local Palestinian firms to
compete with Israeli industry. GDP has been substantially supplemented
by remittances of workers employed in Israel. Such transfers from the
Persian Gulf states dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have
returned to the West Bank, increasing unemployment, and export
revenues have dropped because of the decline of markets in Jordan and
the Gulf states. An estimated 147,000 people were in refugee camps in
1996.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy of Western Samoa has traditionally
been dependent on development aid, private family remittances from
overseas, and agricultural exports. Increasingly, tourism is becoming
a significant source of revenue, earning approximately $34 million in
1995. While registering an overall economic improvement in 1995,
however, the country continues to struggle with a series of natural
disasters from the early 1990s which wiped out the nation's
infrastructure as well as its then-major export crop, taro root.
Agriculture continues to be a key source of wealth for Apia, employing
more than one-half of the labor force, and furnishing 90% of exports.
The bulk of these export earnings comes from the sale of coconut
cream, coconut oil, and copra. Family remittances also play a key role
in economic viability for the island nation - in 1995, remittances
totaled $34.9 million, four times export earnings. The economy did
well in 1996, supported by a steady flow of foreign aid and
remittances.

Economy

Economy - overview: Real global output - gross world product (GWP) -
rose an estimated 3.6% in 1996, with the newly industrializing Third
World countries again setting the pace. And once more, results varied
widely among regions and countries. Average growth of 2.3% in the GDP
of industrialized countries (55% of GWP in 1996) and average growth of
6.5% in the GDP of less developed countries (39% of GWP) were partly
offset by a 2% drop in the GDP of the former USSR/Eastern Europe area
(only 6% of GWP). With the notable exception of Japan at 3%,
unemployment was typically 6%-12% in the industrial world. The US
accounted for 21% of GWP in 1996; Western Europe accounted for 20%;
and Japan accounted for 8%. These are the three "economic superpowers"
presumably destined to compete for mastery in international markets on
into the 21st century. As for the less developed countries: China,
India, and the Four Dragons - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
Singapore - once again posted records of 5% growth or better; however,
many other countries, especially in Africa, continued to suffer from
drought, rapid population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central
Europe and the 15 successor states to the USSR generally made progress
in moving toward "market-friendly" economies, but output in Russia and
Ukraine continued to fall. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically
based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in
Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political
problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The
addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution,
desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of
their own internal problems, the industrialized countries have
inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the
world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming
further marginalized. (For specific economic developments in each
country, see the individual country entries.)

Economy

Economy - overview: The northern city Sanaa is the political capital
of a united Yemen, and the southern city Aden, with its refinery and
port facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future
economic development depends heavily on Western-assisted development
of the country's moderate oil resources. Former South Yemen's
willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
economic support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture
has made northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of
its essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern
Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export crops -
cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing a
shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect
by Yemenis and which has no significant export market. Economic growth
in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives,
partly stemming from centralized control over production decisions,
investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's GDP has been
supplemented by remittances from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign
aid. Since the Gulf crisis, however, remittances have dropped
substantially. Floods in June 1996 caused the loss of much valuable

Economy

Economy - overview: Despite progress in privatization and budgetary
reform, Zambia's economy has a long way to go. Inflation, while
slowing somewhat, continues to be a major concern to the CHILUBA
government. Zambia's copper mining sector, which accounts for over 80%
of the nation's foreign currency intake, is struggling. Production
rates are down as are world copper prices. Aid cuts by Zambia's
donors, arising out of concern for the November 1996 flawed election,
will severely damage Zambia's economic prospects. Urged by the World
Bank, Zambia has embarked on a privatization program which is to
include the all-important copper industry.

Economy

Economy - overview: Agriculture employs 70% of the labor force of this
landlocked nation and supplies almost 40% of exports. Mining accounts
for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but minerals and metals
account for about 40% of exports. Severe drought caused GDP to drop 8%
in 1992, with growth rebounding to 2% in 1993 and 4.5% in 1994, only
to drop by 2.4% in 1995. The government is continuing to push its
IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program aimed at encouraging
exports and foreign investment. Officials face the difficult task of
restraining expenditures in their effort to keep inflation within
bounds.

Economy

Economy - overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with
considerable guidance of investment and foreign trade by government
officials and partial government ownership of some large banks and
industrial firms. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 9% a year
during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster and
has provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and
unemployment are low. Agriculture contributes less than 4% to GDP,
down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries are
steadily being moved off-shore and replaced with more capital- and
technology-intensive industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in
China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The tightening of labor markets has led to an influx of foreign
workers, both legal and illegal.
