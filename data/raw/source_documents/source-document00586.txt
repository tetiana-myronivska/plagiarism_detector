        but not before Paul had spoken a parting word to them, saying,
        "Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your forefathers
        through the Prophet Isaiah:
028:026 "`Go to this people and tell them, you will hear and hear,
        and by no means understand; and will look and look,
        and by no means see.
028:027 For this people's mind has grown callous, their hearing has
        become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent
        their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears,
        or understanding with their minds, and turning back,
        so that I might cure them.'
028:028 "Be fully assured, therefore, that this salvation--God's salvation--
        has now been sent to the Gentiles, and that they, at any rate,
        will give heed."

028:030 After this Paul lived for fully two years in a hired house
        of his own, receiving all who came to see him.
028:031 He announced the coming of the Kingdom of God, and taught
        concerning the Lord Jesus Christ without let or hindrance.
