  Now don't go to say I'm the friend of force;
    Best keep all your spare breath for coolin' your broth;
  And when just Law has a fair clar course,
    All talk of "wild justice" is frenzy and froth.
  Uncle SAM is free, but he sez, sez he:--
      "If he gits within hail
      Of the Glan-na-Gael,
  Or the _Mafia_ either, he shoots," sez he.

  This ain't no matter for sauce or swagger--
    Too summary judgment both scout, I hope;
  Though _ef_ it's a chice betwixt rope and dagger,
    I can't help sayin' I prefer the rope.
  Uncle SAM is free, and he sez, sez he:--
      "At a pinch I'll not flinch
      From a touch of Lynch,--
  That is--at a very _hard_ pinch!" sez he.

  But Lynch Law, UMBERTO, _or_ Secret Society,
    Both are bad, though the latter's wust;
  We'll soon get shut of _either_ variety,
    You and me, UMBERTO, or so I trust.
  Uncle SAM is free, but he sez, sez he:--
      "Assassination
      Won't build a nation,
  Nor yet the _un_legalised rope," sez he.

  Withdraw your Ambassador! Wal, that _air_ summary!
    Italian irons so soon git hot!
  Ironclads? Sure that's mere militant flummery.
    Don't want to rile, but I'll tell you what:
  Uncle SAM is free, but he sez, sez he:--
      "Let FAVA stay,
      Take the _Mafia_ away,
  And we'll call it aright square deal!" sez he.

PRESENTED AT COURT.--Acting upon the suggestions made in these columns
a week ago, the Author of _The Volcano_, and the company of the Court
Theatre have effected the most valuable alterations in the play of the
evening. The Second Act now concludes with the interrupted singing of
_The Wolf_, which brings down the Curtain with a roar of laughter, and
the Third Act is also generally improved. Mrs. JOHN WOOD is seen at
her best as the interviewing lady-journalist, which is condensing in a
sentence a volume of praise. Mr. ARTHUR CECIL, as the Duke, is equally
admirable; and Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH, although scarcely in his element
as a Member of Parliament of noble birth, is distinctly amusing.
Altogether, _The Volcano_ causes explosions of merriment in all parts
of the house, and has entirely escaped the once-impending danger of
fizzling out like a damp squib.

A COMPLAINT OF THE CENSUS.

(_BY A DISAPPOINTED DUKE._)

    [For the first time the sixth column in the Census Schedule is
    simply headed "Profession or Occupation."]

  Oh! I'm a reg'lar rightdown Duke:
  The trying part I act and look
    Right nobly, so they tell me.
  Yet I would have you understand
  Why I am thoroughly unmanned
    At what of late befell me.

  A week or something less ago,
  A schedule came to let me know
    The Census Day was Sunday.
  The many details, one and all,
  Must he filled in, and then they'd call
    To fetch it on the Monday.

  I found it easy to contrive
  To answer columns one to five--
    I filled them up discreetly;
  But when I came to column six
  I got into an awful fix,
    And lost my head completely.

  For "Rank" alas! had disappeared.
  I'd never for an instant feared
    It wouldn't really be there.
  Your "Occupation" you could state,
  "Profession," too, you might relate,
    But I--a Duke--had neither!

  His Grace the Duke of PLAZA-TOR'
  Would call himself, I'm pretty sure,
    A "public entertainer."
  But I and my blue-blooded wife,
  We lead a simple blameless life,
    No life could well be plainer.

  In such a plight what could I do?
  I searched the paper through and through,
    Each paragraph I read. You'll
  Scarce credit it but those who "live
  On their own means" had got to give
    This statement in the schedule!

  I put it, but my ducal pen
  I saw distinctly sputtered when
    I did so. All of which he
  Will please remember when I say
  I thought it in a minor way
    Unkind of Mr. RITCHIE!

MICKY FREE IN PARIS.

As to the incident which recently appeared in the papers under the
head-line "Insulting an Ambassador," our old friend MICKY writes us
as follows:--"Be jabers then, ye must know the truth. Me and Count
MUNSTER was drivin' together. The Count's every bit a true-born son
of Ould Ireland for ever, and descended from the Kings of Munster by
both sides, and more betoken wasn't he wearin' an Ulster at the very
moment, and isn't he the best of chums with the Dukes of CONNAUGHT and
LEINSTER? Any way we were in our baroosh passin' the time o' day to
one another as we were drivin' in the Bore, when whack comes a loaf
o' bread, shied at our heads by an unknown military blaygaird. It
missed me noble friend, the Count, and, as if to give him a lesson
in politeness, it just took off the hat of a domestic alongside the
coachman on the box. 'Tunder and turf!' says I, preparing to descend,
and give the scoundrels a taste of my blackthorn all round. 'Whist!
be aisy now, MICKY,' says the Ambassador to me, in what is, betune
ourselves, his own native tongue; and with that he picks up the loaf,
sniffs at it, makes a wry face ('it's a rye loaf,' says I), and then
says he, out loud, with a supercilious look, 'Ill-bred!' Begorra,
there was a whoop o' delight went up all round, which same was a
sign of their purliteness, as divil a one of the ignoramuses could
onderstand a wurrd the Court said in English or German, let alone
Irish. 'Goot,' says MUNSTER to me, dropping into his German accent,
which, on occasion, comes quite natural to him--the cratur! 'I'll give
the loaf to the dog;' and he whistles up the mastiff, own brother
to BISMARCK's. 'Eh, MICKY, ye gossoon, isn't the proverb, "Loaf me,
loaf my dog"?' Ah! then was cheers for ould Ireland, and a mighty big
dhrink entirely we had that same night.

"Yours as ever, M.F."

_Editor to Eminent Writer_.--Review promises to be deadly slow next

other--you know the style.

_Eminent Writer to Editor_.--Happy to oblige. Got old article handy
advocating cession of Canada and India to the French. Never wrote
anything more ripping. Pitches into everybody. Touching it up, and
will let you have it in two days. By the bye, telegraph people put a
K to my Christian name. Tell them not to do it again.

_Editor to Eminent Writer_ (_a week later_).--Sorry about the K. Got
your article. Not quite what I wanted. Style all right, but arguments
idiotic. Can't you take the other side? Much more popular.

_Eminent Writer to Editor_.--Idea insulting. Any more telegrams of
that sort, and I contribute in future to the _Shortsprightly Review_,

_Editor to Eminent Writer_.--No offence meant. _Is_ there any other
Review besides mine? Never heard of the one you mentioned.

_Eminent Writer to Editor_ (_a month later_).--I say, what's this?
Virulent personal attack on me in your Review, signed with your name!
Pretends my article on giving up Canada, &c., was all a joke! Am I
the sort of man who would joke about anything? Reply at once, with
apology, or I skin you alive in next Number of _Shortsprightly_.

_Editor to Eminent Writer_.--Sorry you're offended. I thought my
Article rather a moderate one. Quite true that I talk about falsehood,
hypocrites, effrontery, demagogues, Pharisees, and so on; but
expressions to be taken in strictly Pickwickian sense, and of course
not intended for _you_.

_Eminent Writer to Editor_.--Explanation unsatisfactory. You first
insert contribution, and then slate it. Do you call yourself an
Editor?

_Editor to Eminent Writer_.--Rather think I _do_ call myself Editor.
Couldn't insert that humbug about India and Canada without reply. By
the bye, have forgotten if you spell Christian name with or without K?
Important. Wire back.

ANOTHER'S!

(_A ONCE REJECTED ADDRESS._)

  Yes! Thou must be another's. Oh,

  I'd always fancied thou wert so
    Peculiarly mine own;
  No welcome doubt my soul can free;
    A convict may not choose--
  Yet, since another's thou must be,
    Most kindly tell me _whose_?

  Is it the Lord of Shilling Thrills
    Who penned _The Black that Mails_--
  That martial man who from the hills
    Excogitates his tales?
  Is it ubiquitous A. LANG?
    Nay, shrink not but explain
  To which of all the writing gang
    Dost properly pertain?

  Perchance to some provincial churl,
    Who blushes quite unseen?
  Perchance to some ambitious Earl
    Or Stockbroker, I ween?
  Such things have frequently occurred,
    And gems like thee have crowned
  The titular and moneyed herd,
    And made them nigh renowned.

  I know not, this alone is clear,
    Thou wert my sole delight;
  I pored on thee by sunshine, dear,
    I dreamed of thee at night.
  Thou wert so good--too splendid for
    The common critic's praise--
  And I was thy proprietor--
    And all the world must gaze!

  But _Punch_, that autocrat, decrees
    That thou another's art:
  I cannot choose but bow my knees
    And lacerate my heart.
  Thou must be someone's else, alack!
    The truth remains confessed--
  For _Mr. P._ hath sent thee back,
    _My cherished little Jest._

EARL GRANVILLE.

BORN IN 1815. DIED 31ST MARCH, 1891.

  The coarser Cyclops now combine
    To push the Olympians from their places;
  And dead as Pan seems the old line
    Of greater gods and gentler graces.
  Pleasant, amidst the clangour crude
    Of smiting hammer, sounding anvil,
  As bland Arcadian interlude,
    The courtly accents of a GRANVILLE!

  A strenuous time's pedestrian muse
    Shouts pæans to the earth-born giant,
  Whose brows Apollo's wreath refuse,
    Whose strength to Charis is unpliant.
  Demos distrusts the debonair,
    Yet Demos found himself disarming
  To gracious GRANVILLE; unaware
    Won by the calm, witched by the charming.

  Bismarckian vigour, stern and stark
    As Brontes self, was not his dower;
  Not his to steer a storm-tost bark
    Through waves that whelm, and clouds that lower.
  Temper unstirred, unerring tact,
    Were his. He could not "wave the banner,"
  But he could lend to steely act
    The softly silken charm of manner.

  Kindly, accomplished, with a wit
    Lambent yet bland, like summer lightning;
  Venomless rapier-point, whose "hit"
    Was palpable, yet painless. Brightening
  E'en, party conflict with a touch
    Of old-world grace fight could not ruffle!
  Faith, GRANVILLE, we shall miss thee much
    Where kites and crows of faction scuffle!

PATERFAMILIAS ON HIS CENSUS PAPER.

  Head of the Family! That makes me quail.
  I am the Head--and thereby hangs a tale!
  This big blue paper, ruled in many a column,
  Gives rise to some misgivings sad and solemn.
  Relation to that Head? That Head's buzz-brained,
  And its "relations" are--just now--"much strained."
  Citizen-duty I've no wish to shirk,
  But would the State do its own dirty work--
  (My daughters swear _'tis_ dirty). I'd be grateful.
  Instructions? Yes! Imperative and fateful!
  But, oh! I wish they would "instruct" me how
  To tell the truth without a family row.
  "Best of my knowledge and belief"! Ah well
  If Aunt MEHITABEL her age _won't_ tell;
  If Cook will swear she's only thirty-three,
  And rather fancies she was born at sea
  (Where I am now) my "knowledge and belief"
  Are not worth much to the official chief,
  BRIDGES P. HENNIKER, if he only knew it.
  A True Return? Well, if it is not true, it
  Is not _my_ fault. Inquisitorial band,
  I've done my level best--Witness my Hand!
  The bothering business makes me feel quite bilious,
  Peace now--for ten years more!

"FACTA NON VERBA"; OR, PIERROT IN LONDON.

"Of the best! of the very best!" as ZERO or CIRO is perpetually
affirming of everything eatable and drinkable that is for his own
benefit and his customers' refreshment at the little bar, not a
hundred miles from the Monte Carlo tables, where he himself and his
barristers practise day and night; and, as this famous cutter of
sandwiches and confectioner of drinks says of his stock in trade,
so say we of _L'Enfant Prodigue_, which, having been translated by
HORATIUS COCLES SEDGER from Paris to London, has gone straight to the
heart and intelligence of our Theatre-loving public.

[Illustration: A BLACK AND WHITE EXHIBITION.]

It is a subject for curious reflection that, just when the comic
scenes of our English Pantomime have been crushed out by overpowering
weight of gorgeous spectacle, there should re-appear in our midst a
revival of the ancient _Pierrot_ who pantomimed himself into public
favour with the Parisians towards the close of the seventeenth
century. Red-hot poker, sausages, and filching Clown have had their
day, and lo! when everyone said we were tired of the "comic business"
of Pantomime, here in our midst re-appear almost in their habits as
they lived, certainly with their white faces and black skull-caps "as
they appeared," a pair of marvellously clever Pierrots. Mlle. JANE
MAY as _Pierrot Junior_, "the Prodigy son," and M. COURTÈS as _Pierrot
Senior_, are already drawing the town to _Matinées_ at the Prince of
Wales's, causing us to laugh at them and with them in their joys, and
to weep with them in their mimic sorrows. Yes! _Pierrot redivivus!_

Mind you, it is not a piece for children; make no mistake about that;
_they_ will only laugh at the antics, be ignorant of the story, and be
untouched by its truth and pathos. All are good. We like the naughty
_blanchisseuse_ the least of the characters, and wish she had been
_plus petite que ça_. But is it not in nature that the prodigal infant
(veritable boy is Mlle. JANE MAY) should fall in love with a young
woman some years his senior, and far beyond him in experience of the
world? Why certainly. Then the Baron, played with great humour by
M. LOUIS GOUGET, who wins the Mistress with his diamonds, and the
inimitable Black Servant, M. JEAN ARCUEIL, who laughs at poor little
_Pierrot_, and cringes to his wealthy rival and successor,--are they
not both admirable? As for the acting of Madame SCHMIDT as _Madame
Pierrot_, loving wife and devoted mother, it is, as it should be, "too
good for words." Her pantomimic action is so sympathetic throughout,
so--well, in fact, perfect. Who wants to hear them speak? _Facta
non verba_ is their motto. Yet with what _gusto_ the Black, heavily
bribed, mouths out the titled Baron's name, though never a syllable
does he utter! It is all most excellent make-believe.

_Vive Pierrot à Londres!_ We see him much the same as he was when
he delighted the Parisians in 1830,--"_Avec sa grand casaque à gros
boutons, son large pantalon flottant, ses souliers blancs comme le
rests, son visage enfariné, sa tête couverte d'un serre-tête noir ...
le véritable Pierrot avec sa bonhomie naïve ... ses joies d'enfant, et
ses chagrins d'un effet si comique_"--and also so pathetic.

If this entertainment could be given at night, the house would be
crammed during a long run; but afternoon possibilities are limited.
More than a word of praise must be given to M. ANDRÉ WORMSER's music,
which, personally conducted by Mr. CROOK, goes hand in hand with the
story written by MICHEL CARRÉ FILS, and illustrated by these clever
pantomimists. No amateur of good acting should fail to see this
performance. _Verb. sap._

In the _Salon_ this year, the _Athenæum_ says, "a _Grand Salon de
Repos_ will be provided." For pictures of "still life" only, we
suppose. Will Sir FREDERICK, P.R.A., act on the suggestion, and set
aside one of the rooms in Burlington House as a Dormitory?

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

Aha! special attraction in _The New Review_! "April Fool's Day Poem,"
by ALFRED AUSTIN, and, an announcement on the cover that "_This
number contains a Picture of_ Miss ELLEN TERRY _in one of her earliest
parts._" Oh, dear! I wish it didn't contain this picture, which is
a bleared red photograph of Misses KATE and ELLEN TERRY, "as they
appeared" (as they never could appear, I'm sure) in an entertainment
which achieved a great success in the provinces--but not with this
red-Indian picture as a poster. Of course it may be intended as
compliment-terry; it _may_ mean "always entertaining and ever reddy."
However, the picture is naught, except as a curiosity; but the first
instalment of our ELLEN's reminiscences is delightfully written,
because given quite naturally, just as the celebrated actress
herself would dictate--(of course she never has to "dictate," as her
scarcely-breathed wish is a law)--to her pleasantly-tasked amanuensis.
Next lot, please!

In _Macmillan's_ for this month, ANDRÉ HOPE tells a fluttering tale in
recounting "A Mystery of Old Gray's Inn." It would have come well from
that weird old clerk, to whom _Mr. Pickwick_ listened with interest
during the convivialities at the "Magpie and Stump." It should take
a prominent place in the proposed new issue of _Half Hours with Jumpy
Authors_.

[Illustration]

The Baron has just read a delightful paper on "The Bretons at Home,"
by CHARLES G. WOOD, in the _Argosy_, for this month. The Baron who has
been there, and still would go if he could, but, as he can't, he is
contented to let "WOOD go" without him, and to read the latter's tales
of a traveller.

_Turf Celebrities I have Known_, by WILLIAM DAY, is a gossipy,
snarly sort of book; casting a rather murky or grey Day-light on a
considerable number of Celebrities who were once on the turf, and are
now under it. But the Baron not being himself either on the turf or
under it, supposes that this DAY is an authority, as was once upon a
time, that is, only the other day, the Dey of ALGIERS. But this DAY
is not of Algiers, but of All-gibes. Ordinarily it is true that "Every
dog has his day." Exceptions prove the rule, and it would appear from
this book--"not the first 'book,' I suppose," quoth the Baron, "that
Mr. DAY has 'made' or assisted in 'making,'"--that not every dog did
_not_ 'have' this particular Day, but that some dogs did. The writer
has missed the chance of a good title--not for himself, but for his
book. He should have it an autobiography, and then call it, "_De Die
in Diem; or, Day by Day_."

Everyone's truly, THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

WHAT IT WILL COME TO!

(_A FRAGMENT FROM A MILITARY-COMMERCIAL ROMANCE OF THE FUTURE._)

And so Mr. ELLERSDEE approached his proposed recruit, and invited him
to lunch to discuss the matter quietly.

"You are very good," returned the other, "but I can assure you I eat
nothing before dinner. Won't you have a cigar?"

Mr. ELLERSDEE accepted the proffered kindness, and remarked upon the
excellent quality of the tobacco.

"Yes," assented his companion, "it is not half bad, for we get all our
supplies from the Stores; and now what can I do for you?"

Then Mr. ELLERSDEE unfolded his sad story. England was losing her
commercial prosperity, owing to a scarcity of labourers, artisans,
nay, even clerks. The Empire was in as bad a condition as those
foreign countries in which forced military service was established.
Like France and Germany, trade was being ruined by the Army. Would not
the young man desert, and become a recruit in the Labour League?

"My dear friend," was the reply, "I hope I am as patriotic as most
people, but I cannot sacrifice my just interest entirely to sentiment.
What can you give me in exchange for my present life? I have
recreation-rooms, libraries, polytechnics, and every sort of
amusement?"

"But also drill and discipline," urged the other.

"Which I am told by my medical attendant (whose services by the way
are gratuitous), are excellent for my health. This being so, I can
scarcely complain of those institutions. Then I have excellent pay
and ample food. Now, I ask you frankly, can the advantages offered by
Trade compare for a moment with the privileges, as a soldier, I now
enjoy? Tell me frankly, shall I improve my position by giving up the
Army?"

And Mr. ELLERSDEE was compelled to answer in the negative!
