On which the young scoundrel, knowing well that it is elsewhere,
pipes out, "There it _is_, Fa-ther, there it _is_, Fa-ther!" with
an unctuous humility shading into impatient contempt that is simply
indescribable, being indeed too revolting for words.

Then, as the father still wavers, his son makes some observations
which I cannot quite follow, but take to be on the fairness of the
game as played with a sportsbird, and the certainty that the luck must
turn sooner or later. After which he exhorts him--this time in plain
English--to "be a bird." Whereupon the doting old parent decides that
he _will_ be a bird and back the middle thimble, and the next moment I
hear the son exclaim, evidently referring to the rook, "No, '_e_'s got
it; no, '_e_'s got it. Cheer up! Cheer up!" with a perfunctory
concern that is but a poor disguise for indecent exultation. I am not
suggesting, by the way, that birds are in the habit of dropping their
"h's"--but _this_ one does. There are times when he is so elated by
his parent's defeat that he cannot repress an outburst of inarticulate
devilry. And so the game goes on, minute after minute, hour after
hour, every day from dawn to dusk. The amount of grains or grubs or
whatever the stakes may be (and it is not likely that any rook would
play for love), that that old idiot must have lost even since I have
been here, is beyond all calculation. He has never once been allowed
to spot the right thimble, but he _will_ go on. As to the son's motive
in permitting it, any bird of the world would tell you that, if you
possess a senile parent who is bound to be rooked by somebody, it
had better be by a person with whom you can come to a previous
arrangement.

Now I come to think of it, though, I have not heard the unnatural
offspring once since I sat down to write this. Can it have dawned at
last upon his parent that this is one of those little games where the
odds are a trifle too heavy in favour of the Table? Or can the son
have sickened of his own villainy and washed his claws of his shady
confederate? I don't know why, but I am almost beginning to hope....
No; through the open window comes the well-known cry, "There it _is_,
Fa-ther! There it _is_, Fa-ther! Be a bird! Be a _bird_!... No, '_e_'s
got it! No, '_e_'s got it! Cheer up! Cheer up!" They are at it again!

F.A.

A SHADY TENANT.

    [From inquiries made by a _Daily Chronicle_ representative it
    appears that the present demand for housing accommodation is
    such that people no longer draw the line at ghosts.]

  The problem at last is a thing of the past;
    Doubts and fears, Geraldine, are at rest;
  We can put up the banns and make definite plans,
    For the love-birds will soon have a nest.
  I've inspected, my sweet, the sequestered retreat
    In which we are destined to dwell,
  And on thinking things out I have not the least doubt
    It will suit us exceedingly well.

  There are drawbacks, I grant, but one nowadays can't
    Have perfection, as you are aware,
  And I'm sure you won't grouse when I state that the house
    Is both damp and in need of repair.
  I might add there's a floor that shows traces of gore;
    I discovered the latter to be
  That of one Lady Jane, who was brutally slain
    By her husband in Sixteen-Two-Three.

  Years have passed since the time of that dastardly crime,
    But the victim's intangible shade
  Can be seen to this day, so the villagers say,
    In diaphanous garments arrayed.
  In the gloom of the room where she met with her doom
    She's appearing once nightly, it seems,
  And the listener quails as lugubrious wails
    Are succeeded by agonised screams.

  But the trivial flaws I have mentioned need cause
    No concern; I am certain that you
  Will approve of my choice, Geraldine, and rejoice
    In the thought that our haven's in view.
  In the likely event of your mother's descent
    There's the warmest of welcomes in store,
  And a rug I'll provide for her bedroom, to hide
    That indelible stain on the floor.

THE NEW ARM.

_(On perceiving William in mufti again and carrying one.)_

  What is this implement of warfare, Bill?
    What seed of fire within its entrails slumbers?
  Does it unfold at all? Run through the drill,
    Doing it first by numbers.

  Not a grenade and not a parachute?
    Some remnant rather of the ancient folly,
  Some touch of times before the Big Dispute?
    I have it now! A brolly.

  Yes, and it opens outwards like a tent,
    Guarding the sacred poll from skies injurious.
  Up with it! Let us see your tops'ls bent.
    How splendid! And how curious!

  Do it again, Bill. I am better now;
    Only at first, perhaps, I slightly trembled.
  Press on the little clutch and show me how
    The parts are reassembled.

  To think men poked these things into the sky,
    Fearing to face the storm's minutest particles,
  Through four long hectic years, whilst you and I
    Forgot there were such articles.

  It brings the old times back to one again,
    The grim-eyed crowd that faced the morning's dolours
  Doing their very best to drip the rain
    Down other people's collars;

  The fond, fond pair beneath a single dome;
    The fight to ride on Hammersmiths and Chelseas;
  The rapture when you found on reaching home
    Your gamp was someone else's.

  O symbol of routine and office hours!
    O emblem of the soft civilian status!
  Shall I too deign to roof me from the showers
    With such an apparatus?

  Shall I consent to grasp within my hand
    The sign of serfdom and to get the habit
  Of marching like a mushroom down the Strand,
    A mushroom on a rabbit?

  Never. O hateful sight! And yet--and yet
    I'm not so sure. This month has been a dry one;
  June will most probably be beastly wet;
    P'r'aps, after all, I'll buy one.

  EVOE.

   OUR HELPFUL CONTEMPORARIES.

   "There have been cases, we believe, in which the height of a
   person has increased after the person had reached mature age, but
   it has always been suspected that this was due to greater
   uprightness. A man who stoops always looks shorter than when he
   is standing quite upright. But no such explanation as this can be
   given for an apparent increase of the human head. If a head
   really requires a larger hat it must be because the head is
   larger."--_Provincial Paper_.
