    TURNER & FISHER:
    NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA.


[Illustration]

Look at this young ensign, how fine he looks with his banner and his
sword. Wouldn't you like to be a soldier? to fight for your
country?


[Illustration]

This soldier has got leave of absence for a few days, and has joined
a party of hunters. Here he is with his horn, whip, cap, and dog.


[Illustration]

Here is an old Turkish officer, who is just going to fight; see he
has drawn his sabre, and is holding out his shield to defend
himself.


[Illustration]

This is a soldier returning from the hunt, as it is time for him to
join his regiment; which has received orders to march to another
barracks.


[Illustration]

Here is a soldier going to battle with his knapsack on his back, and
his gun in his hand, he is going to meet his fellow soldiers.


[Illustration]

This is a soldier who fights with a spear. In olden times, spears
and arrows, were used in war; but now, guns, rifles, cannons and
swords are used.


[Illustration]

This is an officer of a company of soldiers, he has drawn his men up
in a line, and is now telling them how they must act when they are
in battle.


[Illustration]

This man is a Herald; it is his duty to proclaim the commander's
orders to the soldiers throughout the camp. See, he has a trumpet.
