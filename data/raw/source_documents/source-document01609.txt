:0: Numeric zero, as opposed to `O' (the 15th letter of the English
   alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they look a lot alike, and
   various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have
   compounded the confusion.  If your zero is center-dotted and
   letter-O is not, or if letter-O looks almost rectangular but zero
   more like an American football stood on end, you're probably
   looking at a modern character display (though the dotted zero seems
   to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your
   zero is slashed but letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an
   old-style ASCII graphic set descended from the default typewheel on
   the venerable ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom slashed-O is
   a letter, curse this arrangement).  If letter-O has a slash across
   it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very old
   convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers
   (Scandinavians curse *this* arrangement even more, because it
   means two of their letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys
   equipment displays a zero with a *reversed* slash.  And yet
   another convention common on early line printers left zero
   unornamented but added a tail or hook to the letter-O so that it
   resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O.  Are we
   sufficiently confused yet?

:1TBS: // n. The "One True Brace Style"; see {indent style}.

:120 reset: /wuhn-twen'tee ree'set/ [from 120 volts, U.S. wall
   voltage] n. To cycle power on a machine in order to reset or unjam
   it.  Compare {Big Red Switch}, {power cycle}.

:2: infix. In translation software written by hackers, infix 2 often
   represents the syllable *to* with the connotation
   `translate to': as in dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string
   (integer to string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to [nt]roff).

:@-party: /at'par`tee/ [from the @-sign in an Internet address]
   n.  (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n par`tee/) A semi-closed
   party thrown for hackers at a science-fiction convention (esp.
   the annual Worldcon); one must have a {network address} to
   get in, or at least be in company with someone who does.  One of
   the most reliable opportunities for hackers to meet face to face
   with people who might otherwise be represented by mere phosphor
   dots on their screens.  Compare {boink}.

:@Begin: // See {\begin}.

:\begin: // [from the LaTeX command] With \end, used
   humorously in writing to indicate a context or to remark on the
   surrounded text.  For example:

     \begin{flame}
     Predicate logic is the only good programming
     language.  Anyone who would use anything else
     is an idiot.  Also, all computers should be
     tredecimal instead of binary.
     \end{flame}

   The Scribe users at CMU and elsewhere used to use @Begin/@End in
   an identical way (LaTeX was built to resemble Scribe).  On USENET,
   this construct would more frequently be rendered as `<FLAME ON>'
   and `<FLAME OFF>'.
