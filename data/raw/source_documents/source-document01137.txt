  |   This superb building will be devoted to retail purposes,   |
  | where every description of dry-goods, from the necessary and |
  | convenient to the most elegant and fashionable, will attract |
  | a multitudinous throng, and add even a new attraction to the |
  |  brilliancy of Broadway in the most delightful part of the   |
  |   thoroughfare. Besides an immense trade extending to all    |
  |  parts of the United States, LORD & TAYLOR deal largely in   |
  |  carpets and oil-cloths, in upholstery and house furnishing  |
  |   goods, and especially in trousseaux, cloaks, and ladies'   |
  |   furnishing goods of all kinds, in which, perhaps, their    |
  |   business is heavier than that of any other house in the    |
  |   city. The furnishing of hotels and steamboats is one of    |
  | their specialties. The headquarters of their wholesale trade |
  |  is at the old Broadway and Grand street store, while their  |
  |   stock of carpets and oil-cloths is mainly limited to the   |
  |      Grand and Chrystie street establishment. Since the      |
  |  organization of the firm, five partners have retired with   |
  |    fortunes, to make room for younger men, thus affording    |
  |   opportunities for others to profit by the experience and   |
  | success of the house. These changes have also had the effect |
  | to maintain the original vigor of the firm without detaching |
  |      from the maturity of judgment that has marked its       |
  |  operations. Some idea of the magnitude of the business of   |
  |  the house may be inferred from the fact that the pay-roll   |
  |        contains the names of more than 1,000 persons.        |
  |                                                              |
