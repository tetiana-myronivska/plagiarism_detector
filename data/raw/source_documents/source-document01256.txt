A POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK

(1774-1861)

By D.S. ALEXANDER. Two volumes. 840 pp. 8vo. $5.00 net (carriage
extra).

This work presents a history of the movements of political parties in
New York State from 1774 to 1861, and embraces a series of brilliant
character studies of the leaders, most of them of national importance,
who, from the days of George Clinton, have drawn the attention of the
nation to New York. The astute methods and sources of power by which
George Clinton, Hamilton, Burr, DeWitt Clinton, Van Buren, Seymour and
Thurlow Weed each successively controlled the political destiny of the
State are clearly and picturesquely set forth.

"It meets a want widely felt and repeatedly expressed during the past
hundred years.... It would be impossible in a dozen notices to render
any sort of justice to the extensive scope of this work and to the
multiplicity of its interesting details."--From two leading articles,
aggregating over ten columns, in the _New York Sun_.

"Will undoubtedly take its place as the authoritative work upon the
subject."--_Boston Transcript._

"Without question he has performed ... his task very capably. He
addresses the general reader and takes pains to be entertaining,
dealing with men in preference to measures--and only the most
conspicuous, the most interesting men.... Of these outstanding figures
there are full length portraits--biographies, indeed, in ample detail
strung on a long thread of politics, while very many minor characters
have thumb-nail sketches. Few of the good anecdotes available, it
would seem, have escaped Mr. Alexander, and good stories do not suffer
at his hands."--_The New York Globe._

"Will not only repay careful reading, but should be placed among the
permanent reference books of every man who has occasion to know
anything about the politics of this state.... Estimates of the great
men ... are among its most interesting features."--_Buffalo Express._

"The most entertaining story of state politics in American
history."--_Review of Reviews._

"Will be read with great interest and profit outside the Empire
State."--_Cleveland Plain Dealer._

American Public Problems

EDITED BY

RALPH CURTIS RINGWALT


IMMIGRATION: And Its Effects Upon the United States

By PRESCOTT F. HALL, A.B., LL.B., Secretary of the Immigration
Restriction League. 393 pp. $1.50 net. By mail, $1.65.

"Should prove interesting to everyone. Very readable, forceful and
convincing. Mr. Hall considers every possible phase of this great
question and does it in a masterly way that shows not only that he
thoroughly understands it, but that he is deeply interested in it and
has studied everything bearing upon it."--_Boston Transcript._

"A readable work containing a vast amount of valuable information.
Especially to be commended is the discussion of the racial effects. As
a trustworthy general guide it should prove a godsend."--_N.Y. Evening
Post._

"Earnest and unprejudiced.... Cannot fail to be of great assistance in
clarifying and setting on a solid foundation the ideas of people who
are now becoming convinced that the problems of immigration in the
nation and the municipality will soon reach a more acute stage than
ever before."--_Philadelphia Press._

"An auspicious omen of the worth of Messrs. Henry Holt and Company's
recently announced series on American Public Problems.... Mr. Hall has
been in close touch with the immigration movement and he writes with a
grasp and a fullness of information which must commend his work to
every reader.... A handbook ... to which one may turn conveniently for
information for which he would otherwise be obliged to search through
many a dusty document."--_The World To-day._

Sun._

"Well worth reading, and unique because it is devoted wholly to the
election of senators and to the deliberations of the Senate."--_Boston
Transcript._

"Able and dispassionate, and ought to be widely read."--_New York
Commercial._

"Of considerable popular as well as historical interest."--_Dial._

TWO BOOKS ON VITAL QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHTFUL AMERICANS


THE NEGRO AND THE NATION

By GEORGE S. MERRIAM

Probably the first complete history of the negro in his relation to
our politics, _2d printing_ 436 pp. $1.75 net. By mail $1.92.

The Rev. EDWARD EVERETT HALE in "Lend a Hand": "Sensible people who
wish to know, who wish to form good sound opinions, and especially
those who wish to take their honest part in the great duties of the
hour, will read the book, will study it, and will find nothing else
better worth reading and study."

"Admirable, exactly the sort of book needed.... Enlightened and
persuasive discussion of the negro problem in its present phases and
aspects. Not a dry history. Human, dramatic, interesting, absorbing,
there is philosophy of national and political life back of it--a
philosophy which not only furnished interpretation of past events, but
offers guidance for the future.... Impartial and informing.... There
is much that tempts quotation.... Mr. Merriam has given us an
excellent, high-minded, illuminating book on the problem of the
American negro."--_Chicago Record-Herald._

"A deeply interesting story.... An exceedingly readable volume,
especially valuable in its analyses of conditions, causes, situations
and results; and against his main conclusions no sane person can
contend."--_Boston Transcript._


STUDIES IN AMERICAN TRADE-UNIONISM

J.H. HOLLANDER and G.E. BARNETT (Editors)

Twelve papers by graduate students and officers of Johns Hopkins

Trade Unions. There are also chapters on Employers' Associations, the
Knights of Labor, and the American Federation of Labor. (380 pp., 8vo,
$2.75 net. By mail, $2.98.)

"A study of trade-unions in the concrete. Impartial and thorough ...
expertly written."--_New York Times Review._

"Though confined to particular features of particular trade unions,
the data dealt with are comprehensive and typical; so that the result
is a substantial contribution to our knowledge of trade-union
structure and functions.... Excellent studies."--_New York Evening
Post._

"It is doubtful if anything approaching it in breadth and coördination
has yet found its way into print.... A very useful book."--_San
Francisco Chronicle._

AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY


OUR PHILIPPINE PROBLEM

By Prof. HENRY PARKER WILLIS

A study of American Colonial Policy. 12mo, $1.50 net (By mail, $1.64)

A book of vital interest, based on personal investigation in the
Philippines by a former editorial writer of the _New York Evening
Post_, who was also Washington correspondent of the _New York Journal
of Commerce_ and _Springfield Republican_, and is now a professor in
Washington and Lee University.

"Anyone desiring to inform himself fully as to the history, politics,
public questions, in short, everything dealing with the subject of
American control of the Philippines from the day Dewey entered Manila
harbor to the present, will find Mr. Willis's work a most important
book.... He writes of the Filipinos as he found them, and with the
knack of the true investigator, has avoided falling in with the
political views of any party or faction. More valuable still is his
exposition of the Philippine question in its bearings on American life
and politics. A most exhaustive, careful, honest and unbiased review
of every phase of the question."--_The Washington Post._

"A keen, exhaustive and merciless criticism of the whole Philippine
experiment.... His unsparing analysis of all the departments of
Philippine government must (however) command respect as able, honest
and sincere ... no other book contains more solid truth, or a greater
section of the truth."--_Springfield Republican._

"A most interesting treatise ... having an important bearing upon our
future progress."--_Public Opinion._

Indies are particularly interesting and suggestive."--_Review of
Reviews._

"An interesting ... survey of a broad field ... contains a great
variety of useful information ... especially valuable to American
exporters."--_Outlook._
