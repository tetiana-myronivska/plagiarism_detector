    Her neck did she CRANE,
    As she looked up the LANE
    To see the Three Bears pass by.
    They all went in, oddly,
    At the head of the Bodley
    An A.B.C. for to buy.

    She went rather nearer
    To get a good look,
    And when she came back
    He had run through her book!

PREFACE


MOTHER HUBBARD, as we all know, had a cupboard which she found bare on
one occasion.

Well, this is Mother Hubbard's Picture Book, and it's rather bearish,
too, for there are no less than THREE BEARS therein.

But you must not suppose that the book is altogether bear, because there
are other things in it.

There's Apple pie, for instance to my certain knowledge, and "victuals
and drink" of sorts, as well--but I must not let the cat out of the bag
(or the cupboard) all at once--besides Mother Hubbard's clever dog is
still feeding it, for his day (in spite of muzzles) is not over yet, and
he is up to all his old tricks.

When you are tired of him, and if you can manage to get past the Three
Bears, you will find the rest as ABSURDly easy as A.B.C. and probably
meet many old friends on the way.

[Illustration]

      Old Mother Hubbard
        Went to the cupboard
    To get her poor Dog a bone;
      But when she came there
      The cupboard was bare,
    And so the poor Dog had none.

[Illustration]

    She went to the baker's
      To buy him some bread,
    But when she came back,
      The poor Dog was dead.

[Illustration]

    She went to the joiner's
      To buy him a coffin,
    But when she came back,
      The poor Dog was laughing.

[Illustration]

    She took a clean dish
      To get him some tripe,
    But when she came back,
      He was smoking a pipe.

    She went to the ale-house
      To get him some beer,
    But when she came back,
      The Dog sat in a chair.

[Illustration]

    She went to the tavern
      For white wine and red,
    But when she came back,
      The Dog stood on his head.

    She went to the hatter's,
      To buy him a hat,
    But when she came back,
      He was feeding the cat.

[Illustration]

    She went to the barber's
      To buy him a wig,
    But when she came back,
      He was dancing a jig.

    She went to the fruiterer's
      To buy him some fruit,
    But when she came back,
      He was playing the flute.

[Illustration]

    She went to the tailor's
      To buy him a coat,
    But when she came back,
      He was riding a goat.

    She went to the cobbler's
      To buy him some shoes,
    But when she came back,
      He was reading the news.

[Illustration]

    She went to the sempstress
      To buy him some linen,
    But when she came back,
      The Dog was a-spinning.

    She went to the hosier's
      To buy him some hose,
    But when she came back,
      He was drest in his clothes.

[Illustration]

    The Dame made a curtsey,
      The Dog made a bow;
    The Dame said, "Your servant,"
      The Dog said, "Bow wow!"

    This wonderful Dog
      Was Dame Hubbard's delight,
    He could sing, he could dance.
      He could read, he could write.

    She gave him rich dainties
      Whenever he fed,
    And erected a monument
      When he was dead.

    THE THREE BEARS.


    Some time ago, ere we were born or thought of,
      There lived a little girl, who liked to roam
    Through lonely woods and lanes, unknown, unsought of
      Such folk who like to stop and stay at home.
    She found out curious things in all her travel
      And one of her adventures I will tell:
    Once, in a wood she saw a path of gravel,
      Which led to a small cottage in a dell.

[Illustration]

    And, as the door stood open, in walked boldly,
      This child, whose name was Silverlocks, I'm told;
    There was nobody there to treat her coldly,
      No friend to call her back, no nurse to scold.
    She found herself within a parlour charming;
      And there upon the table there were placed
    Three basins, sending up a smell so warming,
      That she at once felt hungry, and must taste.
    The largest basin first, but hot and biting
      The soup was in it, and the second too;
    The smallest basin tasted so inviting,
      That up she ate it all, with small ado.

[Illustration]

    And next she saw three chairs, and tried to sit in
      The biggest, but it was too hard and high;
    The middle one she scarcely seemed to fit in,
      But in the smallest chair sat easily;
    And rocked herself, her ease and comfort taking,
      Singing the pretty songs she knew so well;
    When, oh! the little chair cracked loud, and, breaking,
    Gave way all suddenly, and down she fell.

[Illustration]

    "Ah, well," she thought, "there may be beds to lie on
    Upstairs; I think I'll go at once and see."
    And so there were; she said aloud, "I'll try one,
    For I am tired and sleepy as can be."
    The biggest bed was not of feathers, surely,
    It was so hard; and so she tried the next,
    And found it little better; but securely
    She slept upon the smallest one, unvext.
    The little house belonged to bears, not persons;
    The Father Bear, so very rough and large;
    The Mother Bear (I have known many worse ones);

[Illustration]

    And then the little Cub, their only charge.
    They had gone for a walk before their dinner;
    Returning, Father growled, "Who's touched my soup?"
    "Who's touched my soup?" said Mother, with voice thinner;
    "But mine," said little Cub, "is finished up!"
    They turned to draw their chairs a little nearer;
    "Who's sat in my chair?" growled the Father Bear;
    "Who's sat in my chair?" said the Mother, clearer;
    And squeaked the little Cub, "Who's broken my small chair?"

[Illustration]

    They rushed upstairs, and Father Bruin, growling,
    Cried out, "Who's lain upon my bed?"
    "Who's lain on mine?" cried Mother Bruin, howling;

[Illustration]

    "But some one _lies_ on mine!" the small Bear said.
    "We'll kill the child, and eat her for our dinner,"
    The Father growled; but said the Mother, "No;
    For supper she shall be, and I will skin her."
    "No," said the little Cub, "we'll let her go."

[Illustration]

    So Silverlocks, in sudden terror flying,
    Reached home; and when the Nurse the story hears,
    She says, "You are in luck, there's no denying,
    To get away in safety from THREE BEARS."
