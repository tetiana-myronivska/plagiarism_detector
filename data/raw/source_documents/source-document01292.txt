    As learned _Johnian_ wracks his Brain----
  Thinks, ----hems, ----looks wise, ----then thinks again;----
  When all this Preparation's done,
  The mighty Product is ---- a Pun.

    So some with direful strange Grimaces,
  Within this Dome distort their Faces;
  Strain, ----squeeze, ----yet loth for to depart,
  Again they strain--for what? a Fart.

    Hence _Cantabs_ take this moral Trite,
  'Gainst Nature, if ye think or sh - - te;
  Use all the Labour, all the Art,
  'Twill ne'er exceed a Pun, or Fart.

  A Prude for my Money, by G - - d.

    T. S. 1711.


_Written on the Looking-Glass of Mr. T - - p - - n,
  Fellow-Commoner of Trinity-College, Cambridge._

_Imago in Speculo loquitur ad T - - p - - n._

  I.

  Thou pretty little fluttering Thing,
    That mak'st this gaudy Shew;
  Thou senseless Mimick of a Man,
    Thou Being, call'd a Beau.


  II.

  Like me thou art an empty Form,
    Like me alone, thou'rt made;
  Like me delusive seem'st a Man,
    But only art a Shade.


_Tuns in Cambridge, Window facing a certain Alderman's in the Market._

  Is _Molly Fr----_ immortal? ----No.
  She is; and I will prove her so.
  She's fifteen now, and was, I know,
  Fifteen, full fifteen Years ago.


_Underwritten._

  The Fates from Heaven late came Post;
  And thus address'd this _Cambridge_ Toast.

  Say happy Maid that can detain
  Old hoary Time in fetter'd Chain,
  What wouldst thou have to set him free,
  And give thy captive Liberty?

    Miss _Molly_ call'd Mamma aside,
  ---- Whisper'd awhile, then thus reply'd;

    Upon my Life, all I would have
  From _Victor_ is to be a Slave;
  I'll soon untie this Captive's Hands;
  ---- Tie me but fast in _Hymen_'s Bands.


_On the Same on another Pane._

  At Home Miss _Molly_'s scarce fifteen.
    Mamma says she's no more;
  But if the Parish-Book says true,
    Miss _Molly_'s thirty four.
            Poor Miss _Molly_!


_Wrote on Cor---- Cr----d's (a Printer and Bookseller in Cambridge)
  Window in the Shop._

  Ye longing Sophs, say it who can,
  That _Corny_'s not a learned Man.
  He knows well each Edition, Sir,
  Of _Aldus_, and of _Elzevir_;
  Of _Beza_ he profoundly reasons,
  And talks jocose of _Harry Stephens_.
  Though (says a Wag) all this I grant,
  Yet _Corny_ sure must Learning want.
  How so? ----It's plain, (if that we may
  B'lieve what Men of themselves do say,)
  For _Corny_'s openly* confess'd.
  He's but a Blockhead at the best.

    * _Corny_, in Printing a _Latin_ Book, censur'd by the University,
    was forced to plead _Ignoramus_ to save his Bacon.


_Another in the Shop, on C----'s Title Page_

LEARNING.

  Within this learn'd Receptacle of Arts,
  _Corny_, if ask'd, on each can shew his Parts;
  Alike a _Newton_, or a _Ratcliffe_ prove;
  A _Coke_ in Law----an _Etheridge_ in Love.--
  Reason profound----in Hist'ry state each Fact,
  Teach{~DAGGER~} _London_ how to think, or _Walpole_ how to act.

    O say from whence should all this Learning come.----
  From whence?----from each dead Sage around the Room.

    If _Corny_ thence his Fund of Learning draws,
  How great his Skill in Politicks or Laws? ----
  How deeply read? ---- how vast his learned Store? ----
  ---- When ---- past the Title, all his Learning's o'er.

    {~DAGGER~} Bishop.


_Another in the Same._

  Is _Corny_'s Learning much; my Friends;
  Since where it does begin, ---- it ends?


_From a Window in Ardenham-House, Hertfordshire._

  As glass obdurate no Impression takes,
  But what the radiant piercing Diamond makes;
  Just so my Heart all other Pow'rs defies,
  But those of fair _Venilla_'s brilliant Eyes.


_Written in a Lady's Dressing Room._

  _Brunetta_, I grant you, can give her Swain Death;
  But 'tis not with her Eyes, but with her - - ill Breath.


_From a Window in the Inner Temple-Hall._

  Come hither, Barristers of Dress,
  That once your Lips may meet Success:
  From _Rufus_' filthy Hall withdraw;
  Here only ye can live by Law.


_A Rebus on Lady of Quality, on a Glass at the Old Devil Tavern._

  What fly from her Eyes, and the Place whither I
  Must soon be convey'd to, unless she comply,
  Is the Name of the Beauty for whom I could die.

  _N. B._ Darts and _Shafts_ fly from her Eyes, and if one dies,
    one must be _bury_'d.


_Under the Rebus on Lady Sh - - - bury, at the Devil Tavern, is this;_

  What opens a Door, and a Word of Offence,
  Tell the Name of a Nymph of Wit, Beauty, and Sense.

  Supposed to be for Miss _Ke - ly_.


_From the Window of a Chamber in the Inner Temple._

  For dear _Venilla_ in my Arms,
  I'd scorn all other female Charms;
  Ten thousand Beauties she can spare,
  And still be _Fairest_ of the _Fair_.


_From innumerable Windows._

  Like _Mars_ I'll fight, like _Antony_ I'll love,
  I'll drink like _Bacchus_, and I'll whore like _Jove_.


_From the Apollo, the large Dancing-Room in the Devil Tavern, written
  when some were engaged in a particular Country-Dance._

  This Dance foretells that Couple's Life,
  Who mean to dance as Man and Wife;
  As here, they'll first with Vigour set,
  Give Hands, and turn whene'er they meet;
  But soon will quit their former Track,
  Cast off and end in Back to Back.


_From the Angel Tavern, Temple-Bar._

  'Tis hard! 'tis wonderous hard!
    That the Life of a Man
    Should be but a Span,
  And that of a Woman a Yard!


_From a Watch-Maker's Window, Fleet-Street._

  Here Time is bought and sold: 'Tis plain, my Friend,
  My Clocks and Watches shew what I intend;
        For you I Time correct,
        My Time I spend;
          By Time I live,
    But not one Inch will lend,
    Except you pay the ready down or send:
          I trust no Time,
    Unless the Times do mend.


_On a Watch-Case in a Gentleman's Pocket, given him by a Lady._

  The Wretched pray to make more Haste,
  The Happy say we fly too fast;
  Therefore impossible to know,
  Whether I go too fast or slow.

_At Hollyhead, I suppose, written by some Creation-Mender._

  Arra, now what signifies the making the two great Lights?
  The Sun to light the Day, and the Moons to light the Nights:
  For the Sun in the Day-Time there is no Occasion,
  Because I can see very well after my Persuasion:
  But for the Moons, they are very good in a dark Night,
  Because when we cannot see they give us a Light.

  Rail at your Sister, rail at your Brother,
  Rail on, my Boys, and rail at one another.

  Rail as you say, and you'll be all railed in.


_Written upon the Wall of Clements-Inn, when the Dial was put up
  which is supported by a black Slave in a kneeling Posture._

  In vain poor sable Son of Woe,
    Thou seek'st a tender Ear;
  In vain thy Tears with Anguish flow,
    For Mercy dwells not here:
  From Cannibals thou fly'st in vain,
    Lawyers less Quarter give;
  The first won't eat you till you're slain,
    The last will do't alive.


_Hampstead on a Window._

  I am a Dog ----
    In true Fidelity
  I am a Sun ----
    In faithful Constancy:
  I am a Stote, ----
    To please a lustful Lass;
  I am a Hog, ----
    And you may kiss my A----se.
  But if my _Celia_ comes within my Ken;
  Then I shall be again like other Men.


_On another at the same Place._

  My Wife says, Whither do you go?
  And I return, my dear, I do not know;
  Then d----n your Blood, says she, to use me thus;
  And then I call her catterwauling Puss.
