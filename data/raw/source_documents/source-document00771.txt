One  of the  happiest features  of  the Great  War,  and one  of its  most
favourable omens, is  the optimistic spirit in which  our troops, officers
and men  alike, are  making the  best of  things, in  spite of  the trying
conditions in  which they have to  live and carry out  their arduous work.
They  are  as proof  against  physical  discomfort  or hardships,  and  as
determined to  be "jolly,"  as was Mark  Tapley himself.  Our illustration
shows one of our soldiers writing home  from the loft over a cow-shed, his
only shelter "somewhere near the front."  A shaft of sunlight relieves the
gloom of his rough surroundings, and no doubt is reflected in the messages
he is  sending to  his friends at  home. It is  this wholesome  spirit, in
small  matters  and  in  great,  which  makes  for  success.--[_Photo.  by

[Illustration: SERBIA'S GREAT TRIUMPH: AUSTRIAN PRISONERS; HONOURING THE
DEAD: AND SERBIAN WOMEN HELPING WITH THE GUNS.]

It  has  fallen  to  the  Serbians   to  furnish  the  most  complete  and
overwhelming triumph  yet achieved in  the war--the smashing  victory over
the  Austrian  Army on  the  River  Drina during  the  first  ten days  of
December.  Our  photographs  were  taken  on  and  near  the  battlefield.
No.  1 on  the  first page  represents a  preliminary  incident. It  shows
an  Austrian  patrol  captured  while   pressing  forward  with  the  rash
assurance that  characterised the  Austrian headlong advance.  No. 2  is a
battlefield  scene, on  December 3,  when the  Serbians suddenly  attacked
the  Austrians  and  broke  up  their  positions  at  all  points  at  the
outset,  making  whole regiments,  scattered  and  isolated among  ravines
and  valleys,  in  many  instances, surrender  at  discretion.  One  corps
of  disarmed  Austrian  prisoners  is  seen while  being  marched  to  the

                                                    [_Continued opposite._

rear.  No. 3  shows Serbian  villagers placing  wreaths on  the graves  of
fallen  countrymen. Photograph  No. 4  lets  us realise  something of  the
heroic part the women villagers took in helping to achieve the triumph. As
the  battle took  shape they  came forward  and cheered  the men-folk  on,
calling out  "Napréd, braco,  Napréd," "Forward, brothers,  forward," also
helping (as our photograph shows) to push the cannon and ease the worn-out
horses. Yet another instance of the work the Serbian women did is shown in
our page  photograph. Owing to the  lack of Red Cross  men attendants, the
peasant women took  on themselves to serve  as stretcher-bearers, bringing
in  the wounded,  as these  fell in  fight, to  the dressing-tents  in the
villages and  the churches,  which were  used as  hospitals.--[_Photos. by

[Illustration: WITH "SPIT" HELD BY RIFLES, A SPADE, AND A COUPLE OF
STICKS: COOKING THE CHRISTMAS GEESE AT THE FRONT.]

There was no Christmas  truce at the front. The grim  realities of the war
over-rode all considerations  of sentiment, and the hope which  was, for a
while, common to both sides had to be left unfulfilled. None the less, the
Season was not  without its little luxuries, and, thanks  to the excellent
work  of the  Army Service  Corps  and the  thoughtfulness of  sympathetic
friends  at home,  there  was  no dearth  of  substantial necessaries  and
comforts, as well as tobacco and cigarettes galore. Our illustration shows
a group  of soldiers  cooking their  Christmas geese in  the open,  and as
intent  upon their  task as  though  such conditions  were quite  orthodox
and  even such  minor alarums  as  "spasmodic artillery  duels, and  local
fusillades" were things unheard of.--[_Photo. by L.N.A._]

[Illustration: CHRISTMAS AT THE FRONT: BRITISH SOLDIERS BRINGING IN
MISTLETOE.]

It is pleasant  to think that, with  all the dangers and  anxieties of the
war, our soldiers at the front paid  tribute to the season of goodwill. It
is a reassuring picture, this of the  two men in khaki, rifle on shoulder,
but  swinging  from the  deadly  barrels  berried  mistletoe, so  rich  in
suggestion of the happiness of Christmases when the scourge of war was not
upon the nations.--[_Photograph by L.N.A._]


[Illustration: TRYING A BRITISH DAINTY! A FRENCH SOLDIER EATING
CHRISTMAS PUDDING.]

The  conditions under  which tens  of  thousands of  soldiers spent  their
Christmas were memorably abnormal, but, none  the less, the season was not
passed  without such  observance of  old customs,  and such  care for  all
available good  cheer, as were  possible. Our illustration shows  a French
soldier obviously enjoying  his Christmas dinner despite the  fact that he
has to eat it by the wayside.--[_Photo. by Alfieri._]

[Illustration: A MISSING LONDONER! AN ENGLISH M.E.T. MOTOR-'BUS IN THE
HANDS OF THE GERMANS AND PUT TO USE BY THEM.]

As with our  London soldiers at the  front, the fortune of  war has levied
its toll on  other Londoners. Our photograph depicts  the unfortunate fate
that has befallen  a once well-known object in the  streets of London--one
of  the motor-'buses  shipped across  to France  to serve  in transporting
British troops to  the front, now in  the hands of the enemy.  Not many of
them have  had such bad luck,  from all accounts, but  accidents cannot be
helped, and  a victim  has been  claimed now and  again, mostly  at places
where some raiding  Uhlan patrol has managed  to cut in and  ambush one on
some outlying road  near the line of communications between  the front and
an  army base,  catching the  'bus while  returning after  discharging its
soldier "fares."

[Illustration: WEAPONS OF GREY "MOLES," AT TSING-TAU: A LAND-MINE AND
EMERGENCY HAND-GRENADES CAPTURED FROM THE GERMANS.]

The Germans made use of land-mines in  the defence of Tsing-tau, and a few
days after  the town's surrender, on  Nov. 7, several exploded  while they
were being  removed by  the Japanese,  causing much loss  of life.  It was
stated  that the  explosions  killed  two officers  and  eight men,  while
one  officer  and  fifty-six  men  were injured.  The  Germans  also  used
hand-grenades, as  shown in our photograph.  These appear to have  been of
the improvised "jam-tin" type such as has been employed in the trenches in
Flanders  "Eye-Witness" wrote  recently: "Mines  have not  played such  an
important part  in this  mole-work as  might have  been supposed.  We have
heard the  enemy mining and  we have tried  it ourselves, but  one strikes
water in  this country  between seven and  eight feet  down."--[_Photo. by

[Illustration: IN SHELTERS SUGGESTING A ROW OF MINIATURE RAILWAY-ARCHES!
GERMANS IN THEIR "RABBIT-WARRENS" IN THE ARGONNE.]

"In  the Argonne  we  beat  back the  enemy's  attacks  and preserved  our
front." That  is a typical announcement  one constantly sees in  the Paris
_communiqués_ recording events in the  district where the photograph given
above was taken. Special interest being taken in the fighting in Flanders,
one rather  overlooks the give-and-take  warfare being carried  on further
east, where  siege-trench fighting like that  on the Aisne still  goes on.
There the  Germans occupy deeply  dug lines which  are largely made  up of
underground  galleries partly  natural, partly  artificial, in  character,
as  our  photograph shows.  When  the  French  artillery fire  is  severe,
the  Germans  scuttle like  rabbits  into  their  burrows, coming  out  to
man  the  trenches in  front  immediately  the  French infantry  begin  to
approach.--[_Photo. by C.N._]

                    The Most Economical Food for your Baby
                        is either Breast Milk or Glaxo

  Pure, easily digestible milk is the only food suitable for a young baby,
  and contains  everything baby needs.  That is  why, if Baby  cannot have
  breast milk,  he _must_ have  Glaxo, which  is milk enriched  with extra
  cream made  pure and easily digestible.  It costs you but  a trifle more
  than  ordinary milk,  and  is  not only  the  one  safe alternative  for
  breast-milk, but  is also more  economical than  foods which have  to be
  mixed with  milk to make them  nourishing. Glaxo can be  given either in
  turn with breast-milk or as the sole food from birth.

      Breast  milk  does  not  contain    and   purity   are   permanently
      Starch,  Flour,   Malt  or  Cane    retained  by the  Glaxo Process,
      Sugar,  _neither   does  Glaxo_.    which dries  the milk  and cream
      Glaxo  is  entirely pure,  fresh    to  a  powder  and  also  causes
      milk, enriched  with extra cream    the nourishing curd  of the milk
      and  milk-sugar.  Only the  very    subsequently to form into light,
      best  milk is  made into  Glaxo,    flaky particles  easily digested
      and, so  that it shall  be quite    by  even a  very weak  baby. _As
      fresh,  the  milk  is  delivered    a  well-known doctor  has said_:
      to  the Glaxo  factory within  a    "Glaxo is superior to (ordinary)
      few  hours  of its  being  drawn    cow's  milk  for infants,  being
      from the cow, and is immediately    so  much  more  digestible,  and
      pasteurised and filtered and the    should be  absolutely invaluable
      necessary  cream and  milk-sugar    to  mothers who  for any  reason
      added. All the natural sweetness    cannot suckle their infants."
