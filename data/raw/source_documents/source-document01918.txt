INTRODUCTION


In the year 1914 the University Museum secured by purchase a large
six column tablet nearly complete, carrying originally, according to
the scribal note, 240 lines of text. The contents supply the South
Babylonian version of the second book of the epic _sa nagba imuru_,
"He who has seen all things," commonly referred to as the Epic of
Gilgamish. The tablet is said to have been found at Senkere, ancient
Larsa near Warka, modern Arabic name for and vulgar descendant
of the ancient name Uruk, the Biblical Erech mentioned in Genesis
X. 10. This fact makes the new text the more interesting since the
legend of Gilgamish is said to have originated at Erech and the
hero in fact figures as one of the prehistoric Sumerian rulers of
that ancient city. The dynastic list preserved on a Nippur tablet
[1] mentions him as the fifth king of a legendary line of rulers at
Erech, who succeeded the dynasty of Kish, a city in North Babylonia
near the more famous but more recent city Babylon. The list at Erech
contains the names of two well known Sumerian deities, Lugalbanda
[2] and Tammuz. The reign of the former is given at 1,200 years and
that of Tammuz at 100 years. Gilgamish ruled 126 years. We have to
do here with a confusion of myth and history in which the real facts
are disengaged only by conjecture.

The prehistoric Sumerian dynasties were all transformed into the realm
of myth and legend. Nevertheless these rulers, although appearing
in the pretentious nomenclature as gods, appear to have been real
historic personages. [3] The name Gilgamish was originally written
_d_Gi-bil-aga-mis, and means "The fire god (_Gibil_) is a commander,"
abbreviated to _d_Gi-bil-ga-mis, and _d_Gi(s)-bil-ga-mis, a form
which by full labialization of _b_ to _u_ was finally contracted to
_d_Gi-il-ga-mis. [4] Throughout the new text the name is written with
the abbreviation _d_Gi(s), [5] whereas the standard Assyrian text
has consistently the writing _d_GIS-TU [6]-BAR. The latter method of
writing the name is apparently cryptographic for _d_Gis-bar-aga-(mis);
the fire god _Gibil_ has also the title _Gis-bar_.

A fragment of the South Babylonian version of the tenth book was
published in 1902, a text from the period of Hammurapi, which showed
that the Babylonian epic differed very much from the Assyrian in
diction, but not in content. The new tablet, which belongs to the same
period, also differs radically from the diction of the Ninevite text
in the few lines where they duplicate each other. The first line of the
new tablet corresponds to Tablet I, Col. V 25 of the Assyrian text, [7]
where Gilgamish begins to relate his dreams to his mother Ninsun. [8]

The last line of Col. I corresponds to the Assyrian version Book I,
Col. VI 29. From this point onward the new tablet takes up a hitherto
unknown portion of the epic, henceforth to be assigned to the second
book. [9]

At the end of Book I in the Assyrian text and at the end of Col. I of
Book II in the new text, the situation in the legend is as follows. The
harlot halts outside the city of Erech with the enamoured Enkidu,
while she relates to him the two dreams of the king, Gilgamish. In
these dreams which he has told to his mother he receives premonition
concerning the advent of the satyr Enkidu, destined to join with him
in the conquest of Elam.

Now the harlot urges Enkidu to enter the beautiful city, to clothe
himself like other men and to learn the ways of civilization. When
he enters he sees someone, whose name is broken away, eating bread
and drinking milk, but the beautiful barbarian understands not. The
harlot commands him to eat and drink also:


    "It is the conformity of life,
    Of the conditions and fate of the Land."


He rapidly learns the customs of men, becomes a shepherd and a mighty
hunter. At last he comes to the notice of Gilgamish himself, who is
shocked by the newly acquired manner of Enkidu.

"Oh harlot, take away the man," says the lord of Erech. Once again
the faithful woman instructs her heroic lover in the conventions
of society, this time teaching him the importance of the family
in Babylonian life, and obedience to the ruler. Now the people of
Erech assemble about him admiring his godlike appearance. Gilgamish
receives him and they dedicate their arms to heroic endeavor. At this
point the epic brings in a new and powerful _motif_, the renunciation
of woman's love in the presence of a great undertaking. Gilgamish
is enamoured of the beautiful virgin goddess Ishara, and Enkidu,
fearing the effeminate effects of his friend's attachment, prevents
him forcibly from entering a house. A terrific combat between these
heroes ensues, [10] in which Enkidu conquers, and in a magnanimous
speech he reminds Gilgamish of his higher destiny.

In another unplaced fragment of the Assyrian text [11] Enkidu rejects
his mistress also, apparently on his own initiative and for ascetic
reasons. This fragment, heretofore assigned to the second book,
probably belongs to Book III. The tablet of the Assyrian version which
carries the portion related on the new tablet has not been found. Man
redeemed from barbarism is the major theme of Book II.

The newly recovered section of the epic contains two legends which
supplied the glyptic artists of Sumer and Accad with subjects for
seals. Obverse III 28-32 describes Enkidu the slayer of lions and
panthers. Seals in all periods frequently represent Enkidu in combat
with a lion. The struggle between the two heroes, where Enkidu strives
to rescue his friend from the fatal charms of Ishara, is probably
depicted on seals also. On one of the seals published by Ward, _Seal
Cylinders of Western Asia_, No. 459, a nude female stands beside the
struggling heroes. [12] This scene not improbably illustrates the
effort of Enkidu to rescue his friend from the goddess. In fact the
satyr stands between Gilgamish and Ishara(?) on the seal.

TRANSLATION


    Gilgamish arose interpreting dreams,
    addressing his mother.
    "My mother! during my night
    I, having become lusty, wandered about
    in the midst of omens.
    And there came out stars in the heavens,
    Like a ... of heaven he fell upon me.
    I bore him but he was too heavy for me.
    He bore a net but I was not able to bear it.
    I summoned the land to assemble unto him,
    that heroes might kiss his feet.
    He stood up before me [55]
    and they stood over against me.
    I lifted him and carried him away unto thee."
    The mother of Gilgamish she that knows all things,
    said unto Gilgamish:--
    "Truly oh Gilgamish he is
    born [56] in the fields like thee.
    The mountains have reared him.
    Thou beholdest him and art distracted(?)
    Heroes kiss _his_ feet.
    Thou shalt spare him....
    Thou shalt lead him to me."
    Again he dreamed and saw another dream
    and reported it unto his mother.
    "My mother, I have seen another
    [dream. I beheld] my likeness in the street.
    In Erech of the wide spaces [57]
    he hurled the axe,
    and they assembled about him.
    Another axe seemed his visage.
    I saw him and was astounded.
    I loved him as a woman,
    falling upon him in embrace.
    I took him and made him
    my brother."
    The mother of Gilgamish she that knows all things
    [said unto Gilgamish:--]

    (Thus) Gilgamish solves (his) dream.
    Enkidu sitting before the hierodule

    Six days and seven nights
    came forth Enkidu
    and cohabited with the courtesan.
    The hierodule opened her mouth
    speaking unto Enkidu.
    "I behold thee Enkidu; like a god thou art.
    Why with the animals
    wanderest thou on the plain?
    Come! I will lead thee
    into the midst of Erech of the wide places,
    even unto the holy house, dwelling place of Anu.
    Oh Enkidu, arise, I will conduct thee

    And as I ............

    Come thou, arise from the ground

    He heard her speak and accepted her words with favor.
    The advice of the woman
    fell upon his heart.
    She tore off one garment
    and clothed him with it.
    With a second garment
    she clothed herself.

    The hierodule opened her mouth
    and said unto Enkidu:--
    "Eat bread, oh Enkidu!
    It is the conformity of life,

    Enkidu ate bread,
    until he was satiated.
    Beer he drank

    His thoughts became unbounded and he shouted loudly.

    "Oh harlot, take away the man.
    Wherefore did he come to me?
    I would forget the memory of him."
    The hierodule called unto the man
    and came unto him beholding him.
    She sorrowed and was astonished
    how his ways were ............
    Behold she opened her mouth
    saying unto Enkidu:--
    "At home with a family [_to dwell_??]

    Thou shouldest design boundaries(??)

    He cohabits with the wife decreed for him,

    his hair growing thickly like the corn.
    He came forth ...
    into his presence.
    They met in the wide park of the land.
    Enkidu held fast the door
    with his foot,
    and permitted not Gilgamish to enter.
    They grappled with each other
    goring like an ox.
    The threshold they destroyed.
    The wall they demolished.
    Gilgamish and Enkidu
    grappled with each other,
    goring like an ox.
    The threshold they destroyed.
    The wall they demolished.
    Gilgamish bowed
    to the ground at his feet
    and his javelin reposed.
    He turned back his breast.
    After he had turned back his breast,
    Enkidu unto that one
    spoke, even unto Gilgamish.
    "Even as one [60] did thy mother
    bear thee,
    she the wild cow of the cattle stalls,
    Ninsunna,
    whose head she exalted more than a husband.
    Royal power over the people
    Enlil has decreed for thee."

[1] Ni. 13981, published by Dr. Poebel in PBS. V, No. 2.

[2] The local Bêl of Erech and a bye-form of Enlil, the earth god. Here
he is the consort of the mother goddess Ninsun.

[3] Tammuz is probably a real personage, although _Dumu-zi_, his
original name, is certainly later than the title _Ab-ú_, probably the
oldest epithet of this deity, see _Tammuz and Ishtar_, p. 8. _Dumu-zi_
I take to have been originally the name of a prehistoric ruler of
Erech, identified with the primitive deity Abu.

[4] See _ibid._, page 40.

[5] Also Meissner's early Babylonian duplicate of Book X has invariably
the same writing, see Dhorme, _Choix de Textes Religieux_, 298-303.

[6] Sign whose gunufied form is read _aga_.

[7] The standard text of the Assyrian version is by Professor Paul
Haupt, _Das Babylonische Nimrodepos_, Leipzig, 1884.

[8] The name of the mother of Gilgamish has been erroneously read
_ri-mat ilat_Nin-lil, or _Rimat-Bêlit_, see Dhorme 202, 37; 204,
30, etc. But Dr. Poebel, who also copied this text, has shown that
_Nin-lil_ is an erroneous reading for _Nin-sun_. For _Ninsun_ as
mother of Gilgamish see SBP. 153 n. 19 and R.A., IX 113 III 2. _Ri-mat
ilat_Nin-sun should be rendered "The wild cow Ninsun."

[9] The fragments which have been assigned to Book II in the British
Museum collections by Haupt, Jensen, Dhorme and others belong to
later tablets, probably III or IV.

[10] Rm. 289, latter part of Col. II (part of the Assyrian version)
published in HAUPT, _ibid._, 81-4 preserves a defective text of this
part of the epic. This tablet has been erroneously assigned to Book
IV, but it appears to be Book III.

[11] K. 2589 and duplicate (unnumbered) in Haupt, _ibid._, 16-19.

[12] See also Ward, No. 199.

[13] Here this late text includes both variants _pasaru_ and
_zakaru_. The earlier texts have only the one or the other.

[14] For _kakabê_; _b_ becomes _u_ and then is reduced to the
breathing.

[15] The variants have _kima kisri_; _ki-[ma]?-rum_ is a possible
reading. The standard Assyrian texts regard Enkidu as the subject.

[16] Var. _da-an_

[17] _SAM-KAK_ = _ilu_, net. The variant has _ultaprid ki-is-su-su_,
"he shook his murderous weapon." For _kissu_ see ZA. 9,220,4 =
CT. 12,14b 36, _gis-kud_ = _ki-is-su_.

[18] Var. _nussu_ for _nus-su_ = _nussa-su_. The previous translations
of this passage are erroneous.

[19] This is to my knowledge the first occurence of the infinitive
of this verb, _paheru_, not _paharu_.

[20] Text _ma_?

[21] _istanamma_ > _istilamma_.

[22] Cf. Code of Hammurapi IV 52 and Streck in _Babyloniaca_ II 177.

[23] Restored from Tab. I Col. IV 21.

[24] Cf. Dhorme _Choix de Textes Religieux_ 198, 33.

[25] _namastû_ a late form which has followed the analogy of _restû_
in assuming the feminine _t_ as part of the root. The long _û_ is
due to analogy with _namassû_ a Sumerian loan-word with nisbe ending.

[26] Room for a small sign only, perhaps _A; maiak_? For _mâka_,
there, see BEHRENS, LSS. II page 1 and index.

[27] Infinitive "to shepherd"; see also Poebel, PBS. V 106 I,
_ri-ia-ú_, _ri-te-ia-ú_.

[28] The text has clearly _AD-RI_.

[29] Or _azzammim_? The word is probably an adverb; hardly a word
for cup, mug (??).

[30] _it_ is uncertain and _ta_ more likely than _us_. One expects
_ittabriru_. Cf. _muttabrirru_, CT. 17, 15, 2; _littatabrar_, EBELING,
KTA. 69, 4.

[31] For _sapparu_. Text and interpretation uncertain. _uttappis_
II2 from _tapasu_, Hebrew _tapas_, seize.

[32] Text _ta_!

[33] On _ekesu_, drive away, see Zimmern, _Shurpu_, p. 56. Cf. _uk-kis
_ Myhrman, PBS. I 14, 17; _uk-ki-si_, King, Cr. App. V 55; etc., etc.

[34] The Hebrew cognate of _masû_, to forget, is _nasâ_, Arabic
_nasijia_, and occurs here in Babylonian for the first time. See also
Brockelman, _Vergleichende Grammatik_ 160 a.

[35] Probably phonetic variant of _edir_. The preterite of _ederu_,
to be in misery, has not been found. If this interpretation be correct
the preterite _edir_ is established. For the change _r_ > _l_ note also
_attalah_ < _attarah_, Harper, _Letters_ 88, 10, _bilku_ < _birku_,
RA. 9, 77 II 13; _uttakkalu_ < _uttakkaru_, Ebeling, KTA. 49 IV 10.

[36] Also _na_-'-[     -]_ma_ is possible.

[37] The text cannot be correct since it has no intelligible sign. My
reading is uncertain.

[38] Text uncertain, _kal-lu-tim_ is possible.

[39] _KAK-si_.

[40] _KAK-si_.

[41] Literally nostrils. _pitik apunnati-su_, work done in his
presence(?). The meaning of the idiom is uncertain.

[42] Text _ZU_!

[43] Text has erroneous form.

[44] Text _PA-it-tam_ clearly!

[45] Omitted by the scribe.

[46] Sic! The plural of _kakku_, _kakkîtu_(?).

[47] Cf. _e-pi-sa-an-su-nu libâru_, "May they see their doings,"
_Maklu_ VII 17.

[48] For _sakin-sum_.

[49] On the verb _nâku_ see the Babylonian Book of Proverbs § 27.

[50] The verb _la'atu_, to pierce, devour, forms its preterite _ilut_;
see VAB. IV 216, 1.  The present tense which occurs here as _ilut_
also.

[51] Note _BUL(tu-ku)_ = _ratatu_ (falsely entered in Meissner,
SAI. 7993), and _irattutu_ in Zimmern, _Shurpu_, Index.

[52] "For _ipsah_."

[53] Sic! _hu_ reduced to the breathing _'u_; read _i-ni-'u_.

[54] The tablet is reckoned at forty lines in each column,

[55] Literally "he attained my front."

[56] IV1 of _waladu_.

[57] I.e., in the suburb of Erech.

[58] _pataku_ has apparently the same sense originally as _bataku_,
although the one forms its preterite _iptik_, and the other
_ibtuk_. Cf. also _mahasu_ break, hammer and construct.

[59] The passage is obscure. Here _suhuru_ is taken as a loan-word
from sugur = kimmatu, hair of the head. The infinitive II1 of _saharu_
is philologically possible.

[60] I.e., an ordinary man.
