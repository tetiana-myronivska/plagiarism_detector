Background:
  In 1918 the Slovaks joined the closely related Czechs to form

  free. The Slovaks and the Czechs agreed to separate peacefully on 1
  January 1993. Slovakia was invited to join NATO and the EU in 2002.

Economy Slovakia


Economy - overview:
  Slovakia has mastered much of the difficult transition from a
  centrally planned economy to a modern market economy. The DZURINDA
  government has made excellent progress in 2001-03 in macroeconomic
  stabilization and structural reform. Major privatizations are nearly
  complete, the banking sector is almost completely in foreign hands,
  and foreign investment has picked up. Slovakia's economy exceeded
  expectations in 2001-03, despite the general European slowdown.
  Unemployment, at an unacceptable 15% in 2003, remains the economy's
  Achilles heel. The government faces other strong challenges in 2004,
  especially the cutting of budget and current account deficits, the
  containment of inflation, and the strengthening of the health care
  system.

@Slovenia

Introduction Slovenia


Background:
  The Slovene lands were part of the Holy Roman Empire and Austria
  until 1918 when the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming
  a new nation, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II,
  Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though
  Communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with
  the exercise of power of the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded
  in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war.
  Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable
  democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern
  state. In December 2002, Slovenia received an invitation to join
  NATO, and it is scheduled to accede to the EU along with nine other
  states on 1 May 2004. In a March 2003 referendum on NATO and EU
  membership, Slovenes voted 90% in favor of joining the EU and 66% in
  favor of joining NATO.

Economy Slovenia


Economy - overview:
  Slovenia, with its historical ties to Western Europe, enjoys a GDP
  per capita substantially higher than that of the other transitioning
  economies of Central Europe. Privatization of the economy proceeded
  at an accelerated pace in 2002-3, and the budget deficit dropped
  from 3.0% of GDP in 2002 to 1.9% in 2003. Despite the economic
  slowdown in Europe in 2001-03, Slovenia maintained 3% growth.
  Structural reforms to improve the business environment allow for
  greater foreign participation in Slovenia's economy and help to
  lower unemployment. Further measures to curb inflation are also
  needed. Corruption and the high degree of coordination between
  government, business, and central bank policy are issues of concern
  in the run-up to Slovenia's scheduled 1 May 2004 accession to the
  European Union.
