Shooting on a Small Income

By CHARLES WALKER

Illustrated. Crown 8vo, 5_s._

"A pleasant little surprise awaited us when we found on our table ...
'Shooting on a Small Income.' The marked individuality of this book lies
in the fact that in the course of 300 odd pages it gives in concise
language an enormous body of information fully justifying the title
chosen.... The amount of really useful all-round information presented
in such a readable form would be almost impossible to beat in any single
work that has come to our notice."--_Land and Water._

1 Vol. Demy 8vo. 21_s._ net

"Mr. Dale's book must be read through and through--by the sportsman for
pleasure, the historian for facts, and by the breeders of all animals
for the results of judicious mating. It is about the best work on a
hunting subject ever written."--_Sporting Life._

"He has produced a book which is much more than its title promises, and
he has indeed been fortunate in his subject. While Mr. Dale's record
centres upon the hunting field and kennel with scrupulous care for
detail that hunt history demands, he invests it with stronger claims
still upon attention."--_Bailey's Magazine._
