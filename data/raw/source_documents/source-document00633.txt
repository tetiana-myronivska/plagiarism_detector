Book 31        Obadiah

31:001:001 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
           Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador
           is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up
           against her in battle.

31:001:002 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
           greatly despised.

31:001:003 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
           dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
           that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the
           ground?

31:001:004 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set
           thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
           the LORD.

31:001:005 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
           cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
           the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some
           grapes?

31:001:006 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
           things sought up!

31:001:007 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
           border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
           thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have
           laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

31:001:008 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
           men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

31:001:009 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
           that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
           slaughter.

31:001:010 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
           thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

31:001:011 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
           that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
           foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
           Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

31:001:012 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
           in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou
           have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
           destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
           day of distress.

31:001:013 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
           the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
           on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have
           laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;

31:001:014 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
           those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
           delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
           distress.

31:001:015 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
           hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
           upon thine own head.

31:001:016 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
           heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
           shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
           been.

31:001:017 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
           holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
           possessions.

31:001:018 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
           Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
           shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be
           any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken
           it.

31:001:019 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and
           they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the
           fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
           shall possess Gilead.

31:001:020 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
           possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
           captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
           the cities of the south.

31:001:021 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
           Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.
