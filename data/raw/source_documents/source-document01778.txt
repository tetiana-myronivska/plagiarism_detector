Book 43 John
001:001 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
        and the Word was God.
001:002 The same was in the beginning with God.
001:003 All things were made through him.  Without him was not anything
        made that has been made.
001:004 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
001:005 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't
        overcome{The word translated "overcome" (katelaben) can also
        be translated "comprehended." It refers to getting a grip
        on an enemy to defeat him.} it.
001:006 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
001:007 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light,
        that all might believe through him.
001:008 He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify
        about the light.
001:009 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
001:010 He was in the world, and the world was made through him,
        and the world didn't recognize him.
001:011 He came to his own, and those who were his own didn't receive him.
001:012 But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become
        God's children, to those who believe in his name:
001:013 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
        nor of the will of man, but of God.
001:014 The Word became flesh, and lived among us.  We saw his glory,
        such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father,
        full of grace and truth.
001:015 John testified about him.  He cried out, saying, "This was
        he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me,
        for he was before me.'"
001:016 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.
001:017 For the law was given through Moses.  Grace and truth came
        through Jesus Christ.
001:018 No one has seen God at any time.  The one and only Son,{NU reads
        "God"} who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
001:019 This is John's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites
        from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
001:020 He confessed, and didn't deny, but he confessed, "I am
        not the Christ."
001:021 They asked him, "What then?  Are you Elijah?"  He said, "I am not."
        "Are you the Prophet?"  He answered, "No."
001:022 They said therefore to him, "Who are you?
        Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us.
        What do you say about yourself?"
001:023 He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
        'Make straight the way of the Lord,'{Isaiah 40:3} as Isaiah
        the prophet said."
001:024 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
001:025 They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ,
        nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
001:026 John answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands
        one whom you don't know.
001:027 He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me,
        whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen."
001:028 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan,
        where John was baptizing.
001:029 The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold,
        the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
001:030 This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred
        before me, for he was before me.'
001:031 I didn't know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water:
        that he would be revealed to Israel."
001:032 John testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending
        like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.
001:033 I didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water,
        he said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit descending,
        and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in
        the Holy Spirit.'
001:034 I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."
001:035 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,
001:036 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold,
        the Lamb of God!"
001:037 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
001:038 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are
        you looking for?"  They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say,
        being interpreted, Teacher), "where are you staying?"
001:039 He said to them, "Come, and see."  They came and saw
        where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day.
        It was about the tenth hour.{4:00 PM.}
001:040 One of the two who heard John, and followed him,
        was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
001:041 He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him,
        "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted,
        Christ{"Messiah" (Hebrew) and "Christ" (Greek) both mean
        "Anointed One".}).
001:042 He brought him to Jesus.  Jesus looked at him, and said,
        "You are Simon the son of Jonah.  You shall be called Cephas"
        (which is by interpretation, Peter).
001:043 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee,
        and he found Philip.  Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
001:044 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
001:045 Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him,
        of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote:
        Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
001:046 Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out
        of Nazareth?"  Philip said to him, "Come and see."
001:047 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, "Behold,
        an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
001:048 Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?"  Jesus answered him,
        "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree,
        I saw you."
001:049 Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God!  You are
        King of Israel!"
001:050 Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath
        the fig tree,' do you believe?  You will see greater
        things than these!"
001:051 He said to him, "Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you
        will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
        and descending on the Son of Man."
002:001 The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee.
        Jesus' mother was there.
002:002 Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.
002:003 When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him,
        "They have no wine."
002:004 Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and me?
        My hour has not yet come."
002:005 His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."
002:006 Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews'
        manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes{2
        to 3 metretes is about 20 to 30 U. S. Gallons, 16 to 25
        imperial gallons, or 75 to 115 litres.} apiece.
002:007 Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water."
        They filled them up to the brim.
002:008 He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler
        of the feast."  So they took it.
002:009 When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine,
        and didn't know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn
        the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
002:010 and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first,
        and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse.
        You have kept the good wine until now!"
002:011 This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee,
        and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
002:012 After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,
        his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there
        a few days.
002:013 The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went
        up to Jerusalem.
002:014 He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves,
        and the changers of money sitting.
002:015 He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple,
        both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers'
        money, and overthrew their tables.
002:016 To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of here!
        Don't make my Father's house a marketplace!"
002:017 His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your
        house will eat me up."{Psalm 69:9}
002:018 The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show us,
        seeing that you do these things?"
002:019 Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days
        I will raise it up."
002:020 The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple
        in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"
002:021 But he spoke of the temple of his body.
002:022 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples
        remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture,
        and the word which Jesus had said.
002:023 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast,
        many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.
002:024 But Jesus didn't trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,
002:025 and because he didn't need for anyone to testify concerning man;
        for he himself knew what was in man.
003:001 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler
        of the Jews.
003:002 The same came to him by night, and said to him, "Rabbi, we know
        that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do
        these signs that you do, unless God is with him."
003:003 Jesus answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you,
        unless one is born anew,{The word translated "anew"
        here and in John 3:7 (anothen) also means "again" and "from
        above".} he can't see the Kingdom of God."
003:004 Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old?
        Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
003:005 Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born
        of water and spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God!
003:006 That which is born of the flesh is flesh.  That which is born
        of the Spirit is spirit.
003:007 Don't marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.'
003:008 The wind{The same Greek word (pneuma) means wind, breath,
        and spirit.} blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound,
        but don't know where it comes from and where it is going.
        So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
003:009 Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"
003:010 Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't
        understand these things?
003:011 Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know,
        and testify of that which we have seen, and you don't
        receive our witness.
003:012 If I told you earthly things and you don't believe, how will
        you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
003:013 No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven,
        the Son of Man, who is in heaven.
003:014 As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
        the Son of Man be lifted up,
003:015 that whoever believes in him should not perish,
        but have eternal life.
003:016 For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and
        only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish,
        but have eternal life.
003:017 For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world,
        but that the world should be saved through him.
003:018 He who believes in him is not judged.  He who doesn't believe has
        been judged already, because he has not believed in the name
        of the one and only Son of God.
003:019 This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world,
        and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their
        works were evil.
003:020 For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn't come
        to the light, lest his works would be exposed.
003:021 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works
        may be revealed, that they have been done in God."
003:022 After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land
        of Judea.  He stayed there with them, and baptized.
003:023 John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there
        was much water there.  They came, and were baptized.
003:024 For John was not yet thrown into prison.
003:025 There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's
        disciples with some Jews about purification.
003:026 They came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with
        you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold,
        the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him."
003:027 John answered, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been
        given him from heaven.
003:028 You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ,'
        but, 'I have been sent before him.'
003:029 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of
        the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly
        because of the bridegroom's voice.  This, my joy,
        therefore is made full.
003:030 He must increase, but I must decrease.
003:031 He who comes from above is above all.  He who is from
        the Earth belongs to the Earth, and speaks of the Earth.
        He who comes from heaven is above all.
003:032 What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one
        receives his witness.
003:033 He who has received his witness has set his seal to this,
        that God is true.
003:034 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God
        gives the Spirit without measure.
003:035 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
003:036 One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one
        who disobeys{The same word can be translated "disobeys"
        or "disbelieves" in this context.} the Son won't see life,
        but the wrath of God remains on him."
004:001 Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard
        that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
004:002 (although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples),
004:003 he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.
004:004 He needed to pass through Samaria.
004:005 So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel
        of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.
004:006 Jacob's well was there.  Jesus therefore, being tired
        from his journey, sat down by the well.  It was about
        the sixth hour{noon}.
004:007 A woman of Samaria came to draw water.  Jesus said to her,
        "Give me a drink."
004:008 For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
004:009 The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, "How is it that you,
        being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?"
        (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
004:010 Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it
        is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him,
        and he would have given you living water."
004:011 The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with,
        and the well is deep.  From where then have you that living water?
004:012 Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well,
        and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?"
004:013 Jesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks of this water
        will thirst again,
004:014 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never
        thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become
        in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."
004:015 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I
        don't get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."
004:016 Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
004:017 The woman answered, "I have no husband."  Jesus said to her,
        "You said well, 'I have no husband,'
004:018 for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is
        not your husband.  This you have said truly."
004:019 The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
004:020 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that
        in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."
004:021 Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour comes,
        when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you
        worship the Father.
004:022 You worship that which you don't know.  We worship that which we know;
        for salvation is from the Jews.
004:023 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers
        will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father
        seeks such to be his worshippers.
004:024 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in
        spirit and truth."
004:025 The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah comes,"
        (he who is called Christ).  "When he has come, he will declare
        to us all things."
004:026 Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one who speaks to you."
004:027 At this, his disciples came.  They marveled that he was speaking
        with a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?"
        or, "Why do you speak with her?"
004:028 So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city,
        and said to the people,
004:029 "Come, see a man who told me everything that I did.
        Can this be the Christ?"
004:030 They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
004:031 In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
004:032 But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you don't know about."
004:033 The disciples therefore said one to another, "Has anyone
        brought him something to eat?"
004:034 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me,
        and to accomplish his work.
004:035 Don't you say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?'
        Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields,
        that they are white for harvest already.
004:036 He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life;
        that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
004:037 For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'
004:038 I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored.
        Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
004:039 From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of
        the word of the woman, who testified, "He told me everything
        that I did."
004:040 So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay
        with them.  He stayed there two days.
004:041 Many more believed because of his word.
004:042 They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking;
        for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed
        the Christ, the Savior of the world."
004:043 After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.
004:044 For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor
        in his own country.
004:045 So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him,
        having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast,
        for they also went to the feast.
004:046 Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made
        the water into wine.  There was a certain nobleman whose son
        was sick at Capernaum.
004:047 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee,
        he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal
        his son, for he was at the point of death.
004:048 Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders,
        you will in no way believe."
004:049 The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
004:050 Jesus said to him, "Go your way.  Your son lives."
        The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him,
        and he went his way.
004:051 As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported,
        saying "Your child lives!"
004:052 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better.
        They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour,{1:00
        P. M.} the fever left him."
004:053 So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said
        to him, "Your son lives."  He believed, as did his whole house.
004:054 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come
        out of Judea into Galilee.
005:001 After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus
        went up to Jerusalem.
005:002 Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is
        called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.
005:003 In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame,
        or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;
005:004 for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into
        the pool, and stirred up the water.  Whoever stepped in first
        after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever
        disease he had.
005:005 A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
005:006 When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick
        for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to be made well?"
005:007 The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into
        the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming,
        another steps down before me."
005:008 Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."
005:009 Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.
        Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
005:010 So the Jews said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath.
        It is not lawful for you to carry the mat."
005:011 He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me,
        'Take up your mat, and walk.'"
005:012 Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you,
        'Take up your mat, and walk'?"
005:013 But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus
        had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
005:014 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,
        "Behold, you are made well.  Sin no more, so that nothing
        worse happens to you."
005:015 The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had
        made him well.
005:016 For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him,
        because he did these things on the Sabbath.
005:017 But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working,
        so I am working, too."
005:018 For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him,
        because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God
        his own Father, making himself equal with God.
005:019 Jesus therefore answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Son
        can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing.
        For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.
005:020 For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all
        things that he himself does.  He will show him greater works
        than these, that you may marvel.
005:021 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,
        even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.
005:022 For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment
        to the Son,
005:023 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
        He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father
        who sent him.
005:024 "Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him
        who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into judgment,
        but has passed out of death into life.
005:025 Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is,
        when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice; and those
        who hear will live.
005:026 For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son
        also to have life in himself.
005:027 He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is
        a son of man.
005:028 Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are
        in the tombs will hear his voice,
005:029 and will come out; those who have done good, to the
        resurrection of life; and those who have done evil,
        to the resurrection of judgment.
005:030 I can of myself do nothing.  As I hear, I judge, and my
        judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will,
        but the will of my Father who sent me.
005:031 "If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.
005:032 It is another who testifies about me.  I know that the testimony
        which he testifies about me is true.
005:033 You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
005:034 But the testimony which I receive is not from man.
        However, I say these things that you may be saved.
005:035 He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing
        to rejoice for a while in his light.
005:036 But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John,
        for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish,
        the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father
        has sent me.
005:037 The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me.
        You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
005:038 You don't have his word living in you; because you don't
        believe him whom he sent.
005:039 "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you
        have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.
005:040 Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.
005:041 I don't receive glory from men.
005:042 But I know you, that you don't have God's love in yourselves.
005:043 I have come in my Father's name, and you don't receive me.
        If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
005:044 How can you believe, who receive glory from one another,
        and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?
005:045 "Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father.
        There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have
        set your hope.
005:046 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me;
        for he wrote about me.
005:047 But if you don't believe his writings, how will you
        believe my words?"
006:001 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea
        of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
006:002 A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs
        which he did on those who were sick.
006:003 Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.
006:004 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
006:005 Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great
        multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, "Where are we
        to buy bread, that these may eat?"
006:006 This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
006:007 Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread
        is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may
        receive a little."
006:008 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,
        said to him,
006:009 "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish,
        but what are these among so many?"
006:010 Jesus said, "Have the people sit down."  Now there was much
        grass in that place.  So the men sat down, in number
        about five thousand.
006:011 Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed
        to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down;
        likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
006:012 When they were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up
        the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost."
006:013 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken
        pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over
        by those who had eaten.
006:014 When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said,
        "This is truly the prophet who comes into the world."
006:015 Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come
        and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again
        to the mountain by himself.
006:016 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
006:017 and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea
        to Capernaum.  It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
006:018 The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.
006:019 When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty
        stadia,{25 to 30 stadia is about 5 to 6 kilometers or about 3
        to 4 miles} they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing
        near to the boat; and they were afraid.
006:020 But he said to them, "It is I{or, I AM}. Don't be afraid."
006:021 They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat.
        Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
006:022 On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other
        side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there,
        except the one in which his disciples had embarked,
        and that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat,
        but his disciples had gone away alone.
006:023 However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they
        ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
006:024 When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there,
        nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats,
        and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
006:025 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him,
        "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
006:026 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me,
        not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves,
        and were filled.
006:027 Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which
        remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.
        For God the Father has sealed him."
006:028 They said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may work
        the works of God?"
006:029 Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe
        in him whom he has sent."
006:030 They said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign,
        that we may see, and believe you?  What work do you do?
006:031 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.  As it is written,
        'He gave them bread out of heaven{Greek and Hebrew use the same
        word for "heaven", "the heavens", "the sky", and "the air".}
        to eat.'"{Exodus 16:4; Nehemiah 9:15; Psalm 78:24-25}
006:032 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you,
        it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven,
        but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
006:033 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven,
        and gives life to the world."
006:034 They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."
006:035 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.  He who comes
        to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will
        never be thirsty.
006:036 But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.
006:037 All those who the Father gives me will come to me.
        Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
006:038 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will,
        but the will of him who sent me.
006:039 This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has
        given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up
        at the last day.
006:040 This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees
        the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life;
        and I will raise him up at the last day."
006:041 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,
        "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."
006:042 They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
        and mother we know?  How then does he say, 'I have come
        down out of heaven?'"
006:043 Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among yourselves.
006:044 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him,
        and I will raise him up in the last day.
006:045 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by
        God.'{Isaiah 54:13} Therefore everyone who hears from the Father,
        and has learned, comes to me.
006:046 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God.
        He has seen the Father.
006:047 Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.
006:048 I am the bread of life.
006:049 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
006:050 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone
        may eat of it and not die.
006:051 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven.
        If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
        Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world
        is my flesh."
006:052 The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can
        this man give us his flesh to eat?"
006:053 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you,
        unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,
        you don't have life in yourselves.
006:054 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life,
        and I will raise him up at the last day.
006:055 For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
006:056 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me,
        and I in him.
006:057 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father;
        so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.
006:058 This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our
        fathers ate the manna, and died.  He who eats this bread
        will live forever."
006:059 These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
006:060 Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said,
        "This is a hard saying!  Who can listen to it?"
006:061 But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this,
        said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
006:062 Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where
        he was before?
006:063 It is the spirit who gives life.  The flesh profits nothing.
        The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
006:064 But there are some of you who don't believe."  For Jesus
        knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe,
        and who it was who would betray him.
006:065 He said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can
        come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father."
006:066 At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no
        more with him.
006:067 Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don't also want
        to go away, do you?"
006:068 Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go?
        You have the words of eternal life.
006:069 We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ,
        the Son of the living God."
006:070 Jesus answered them, "Didn't I choose you, the twelve,
        and one of you is a devil?"
006:071 Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was
        he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.
007:001 After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn't
        walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
007:002 Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.
007:003 His brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here,
        and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works
        which you do.
007:004 For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be
        known openly.  If you do these things, reveal yourself
        to the world."
007:005 For even his brothers didn't believe in him.
007:006 Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come,
        but your time is always ready.
007:007 The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify
        about it, that its works are evil.
007:008 You go up to the feast.  I am not yet going up to this feast,
        because my time is not yet fulfilled."
007:009 Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.
007:010 But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also
        went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
007:011 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said,
        "Where is he?"
007:012 There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him.
        Some said, "He is a good man."  Others said, "Not so,
        but he leads the multitude astray."
007:013 Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
007:014 But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up
        into the temple and taught.
007:015 The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man
        know letters, having never been educated?"
007:016 Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine,
        but his who sent me.
007:017 If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching,
        whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.
007:018 He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks
        the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness
        is in him.
007:019 Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law?
        Why do you seek to kill me?"
007:020 The multitude answered, "You have a demon!  Who seeks
        to kill you?"
007:021 Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel
        because of it.
007:022 Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses,
        but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.
007:023 If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law
        of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I
        made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath?
007:024 Don't judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
007:025 Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn't this he whom
        they seek to kill?
007:026 Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him.
        Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is
        truly the Christ?
007:027 However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes,
        no one will know where he comes from."
007:028 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying,
        "You both know me, and know where I am from.  I have not come
        of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don't know.
007:029 I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."
007:030 They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him,
        because his hour had not yet come.
007:031 But of the multitude, many believed in him.  They said,
        "When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than those
        which this man has done, will he?"
007:032 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things
        concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent
        officers to arrest him.
007:033 Then Jesus said, "I will be with you a little while longer,
        then I go to him who sent me.
007:034 You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am,
        you can't come."
007:035 The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this
        man go that we won't find him?  Will he go to the Dispersion
        among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
007:036 What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and won't
        find me; and where I am, you can't come'?"
007:037 Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and
        cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
007:038 He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within
        him will flow rivers of living water."
007:039 But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him
        were to receive.  For the Holy Spirit was not yet given,
        because Jesus wasn't yet glorified.
007:040 Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words,
        said, "This is truly the prophet."
007:041 Others said, "This is the Christ."  But some said, "What,
        does the Christ come out of Galilee?
007:042 Hasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed
        of David,{2 Samuel 7:12} and from Bethlehem,{Micah 5:2}
        the village where David was?"
007:043 So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
007:044 Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid
        hands on him.
007:045 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees,
        and they said to them, "Why didn't you bring him?"
007:046 The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"
007:047 The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You aren't also
        led astray, are you?
007:048 Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
007:049 But this multitude that doesn't know the law is accursed."
007:050 Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them)
        said to them,
007:051 "Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him
        personally and knows what he does?"
007:052 They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee?  Search, and see
        that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.{See Isaiah 9:1
        and Matthew 4:13-16.}"
007:053 Everyone went to his own house,
008:001 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
008:002 Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple,
        and all the people came to him.  He sat down, and taught them.
008:003 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery.
        Having set her in the midst,
008:004 they told him, "Teacher, we found this woman in adultery,
        in the very act.
008:005 Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such.{Leviticus 20:10;
        Deuteronomy 22:22} What then do you say about her?"
008:006 They said this testing him, that they might have something
        to accuse him of.  But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on
        the ground with his finger.
008:007 But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them,
        "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first
        stone at her."
008:008 Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
008:009 They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience,
        went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last.
        Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was,
        in the middle.
008:010 Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are
        your accusers?  Did no one condemn you?"
008:011 She said, "No one, Lord."  Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you.
        Go your way.  From now on, sin no more."
008:012 Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light
        of the world.{Isaiah 60:1} He who follows me will not walk
        in the darkness, but will have the light of life."
008:013 The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about yourself.
        Your testimony is not valid."
008:014 Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony
        is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going;
        but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going.
008:015 You judge according to the flesh.  I judge no one.
008:016 Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone,
        but I am with the Father who sent me.
008:017 It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people
        is valid.{Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15}
008:018 I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent
        me testifies about me."
008:019 They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?"  Jesus answered,
        "You know neither me, nor my Father.  If you knew me,
        you would know my Father also."
008:020 Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple.
        Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
008:021 Jesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away,
        and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins.
        Where I go, you can't come."
008:022 The Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says,
        'Where I am going, you can't come?'"
008:023 He said to them, "You are from beneath.  I am from above.
        You are of this world.  I am not of this world.
008:024 I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins;
        for unless you believe that I AM he, you will die in your sins."
008:025 They said therefore to him, "Who are you?"  Jesus said to them,
        "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
008:026 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you.
        However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard
        from him, these I say to the world."
008:027 They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the Father.
008:028 Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son
        of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing
        of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.
008:029 He who sent me is with me.  The Father hasn't left me alone,
        for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."
008:030 As he spoke these things, many believed in him.
008:031 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him,
        "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.
008:032 You will know the truth, and the truth will make
        you free."{Psalm 119:45}
008:033 They answered him, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never been
        in bondage to anyone.  How do you say, 'You will be made free?'"
008:034 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who
        commits sin is the bondservant of sin.
008:035 A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever.
        A son remains forever.
008:036 If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
008:037 I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me,
        because my word finds no place in you.
008:038 I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you
        also do the things which you have seen with your father."
008:039 They answered him, "Our father is Abraham."  Jesus said to them,
        "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.
008:040 But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth,
        which I heard from God.  Abraham didn't do this.
008:041 You do the works of your father."  They said to him, "We were
        not born of sexual immorality.  We have one Father, God."
008:042 Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father,
        you would love me, for I came out and have come from God.
        For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me.
008:043 Why don't you understand my speech?  Because you can't
        hear my word.
008:044 You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires
        of your father.  He was a murderer from the beginning,
        and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
        When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar,
        and the father of it.
008:045 But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.
008:046 Which of you convicts me of sin?  If I tell the truth,
        why do you not believe me?
008:047 He who is of God hears the words of God.  For this cause you
        don't hear, because you are not of God."
008:048 Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are
        a Samaritan, and have a demon?"
008:049 Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father,
        and you dishonor me.
008:050 But I don't seek my own glory.  There is one who seeks and judges.
008:051 Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word,
        he will never see death."
008:052 Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon.
        Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps
        my word, he will never taste of death.'
008:053 Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died?
        The prophets died.  Who do you make yourself out to be?"
008:054 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.
        It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that
        he is our God.
008:055 You have not known him, but I know him.  If I said, 'I don't
        know him,' I would be like you, a liar.  But I know him,
        and keep his word.
008:056 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.  He saw it,
        and was glad."
008:057 The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old,
        and have you seen Abraham?"
008:058 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham
        came into existence, I AM."
008:059 Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden,
        and went out of the temple, having gone through the midst
        of them, and so passed by.
009:001 As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
009:002 His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents,
        that he was born blind?"
009:003 Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents;
        but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.
009:004 I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day.
        The night is coming, when no one can work.
009:005 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
009:006 When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with
        the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,
009:007 and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means
        "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
009:008 The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was
        blind before, said, "Isn't this he who sat and begged?"
009:009 Others were saying, "It is he."  Still others were saying,
        "He looks like him."  He said, "I am he."
009:010 They therefore were asking him, "How were your eyes opened?"
009:011 He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes,
        and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.'
        So I went away and washed, and I received sight."
009:012 Then they asked him, "Where is he?"  He said, "I don't know."
009:013 They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
009:014 It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
009:015 Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received
        his sight.  He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed,
        and I see."
009:016 Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is
        not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath."
        Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?"
        There was division among them.
009:017 Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you
        say about him, because he opened your eyes?"  He said,
        "He is a prophet."
009:018 The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had
        been blind, and had received his sight, until they called
        the parents of him who had received his sight,
009:019 and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind?
        How then does he now see?"
009:020 His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son,
        and that he was born blind;
009:021 but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened
        his eyes, we don't know.  He is of age.  Ask him.
        He will speak for himself."
009:022 His parents said these things because they feared the Jews;
        for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess
        him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
009:023 Therefore his parents said, "He is of age.  Ask him."
009:024 So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him,
        "Give glory to God.  We know that this man is a sinner."
009:025 He therefore answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner.
        One thing I do know:  that though I was blind, now I see."
009:026 They said to him again, "What did he do to you?
        How did he open your eyes?"
009:027 He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen.
        Why do you want to hear it again?  You don't also want
        to become his disciples, do you?"
009:028 They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we
        are disciples of Moses.
009:029 We know that God has spoken to Moses.  But as for this man,
        we don't know where he comes from."
009:030 The man answered them, "How amazing!  You don't know where
        he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
009:031 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone
        is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens
        to him.{Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 15:29; 28:9}
009:032 Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone
        opened the eyes of someone born blind.
009:033 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
009:034 They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins,
        and do you teach us?"  They threw him out.
009:035 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him,
        he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"
009:036 He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"
009:037 Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who
        speaks with you."
009:038 He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshiped him.
009:039 Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who
        don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind."
009:040 Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things,
        and said to him, "Are we also blind?"
009:041 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin;
        but now you say, 'We see.'  Therefore your sin remains.
010:001 "Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the door
        into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same
        is a thief and a robber.
010:002 But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
010:003 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep
        listen to his voice.  He calls his own sheep by name,
        and leads them out.
010:004 Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them,
        and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
010:005 They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him;
        for they don't know the voice of strangers."
010:006 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand
        what he was telling them.
010:007 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell you,
        I am the sheep's door.
010:008 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep
        didn't listen to them.
010:009 I am the door.  If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved,
        and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
010:010 The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy.
        I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
010:011 I am the good shepherd.{Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34:11-12,15,22}
        The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
010:012 He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own
        the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees.
        The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
010:013 The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't
        care for the sheep.
010:014 I am the good shepherd.  I know my own, and I'm known by my own;
010:015 even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father.
        I lay down my life for the sheep.
010:016 I have other sheep, which are not of this fold.{Isaiah 56:8}
        I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice.
        They will become one flock with one shepherd.
010:017 Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,{Isaiah
        53:7-8} that I may take it again.
010:018 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself.
        I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
        I received this commandment from my Father."
010:019 Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because
        of these words.
010:020 Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane!
        Why do you listen to him?"
010:021 Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon.
        It isn't possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind,
        is it?"{Exodus 4:11}
010:022 It was the Feast of the Dedication{The "Feast of the Dedication"
        is the Greek name for "Chanukkah," a celebration of the
        rededication of the Temple.} at Jerusalem.
010:023 It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple,
        in Solomon's porch.
010:024 The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long
        will you hold us in suspense?  If you are the Christ,
        tell us plainly."
010:025 Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don't believe.
        The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me.
010:026 But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep,
        as I told you.
010:027 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
010:028 I give eternal life to them.  They will never perish,
        and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
010:029 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all.
        No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.
010:030 I and the Father are one."
010:031 Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.
010:032 Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from
        my Father.  For which of those works do you stone me?"
010:033 The Jews answered him, "We don't stone you for a good work,
        but for blasphemy:  because you, being a man, make yourself God."
010:034 Jesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I said,
        you are gods?'{Psalm 82:6}
010:035 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came
        (and the Scripture can't be broken),
010:036 do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world,
        'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God?'
010:037 If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me.
010:038 But if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works;
        that you may know and believe that the Father is in me,
        and I in the Father."
010:039 They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.
010:040 He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John
        was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.
010:041 Many came to him.  They said, "John indeed did no sign,
        but everything that John said about this man is true."
010:042 Many believed in him there.
011:001 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village
        of Mary and her sister, Martha.
011:002 It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment,
        and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.
011:003 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for
        whom you have great affection is sick."
011:004 But when Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to death,
        but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by it."
011:005 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
011:006 When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days
        in the place where he was.
011:007 Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let's go
        into Judea again."
011:008 The disciples told him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying
        to stone you, and are you going there again?"
011:009 Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight?
        If a man walks in the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees
        the light of this world.
011:010 But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light
        isn't in him."
011:011 He said these things, and after that, he said to them,
        "Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going
        so that I may awake him out of sleep."
011:012 The disciples therefore said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep,
        he will recover."
011:013 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke
        of taking rest in sleep.
011:014 So Jesus said to them plainly then, "Lazarus is dead.
011:015 I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you
        may believe.  Nevertheless, let's go to him."
011:016 Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus,{"Didymus"
        means "Twin"} said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go also,
        that we may die with him."
011:017 So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb
        four days already.
011:018 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia{15 stadia
        is about 2.8 kilometers or 1.7 miles} away.
011:019 Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary,
        to console them concerning their brother.
011:020 Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him,
        but Mary stayed in the house.
011:021 Therefore Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here,
        my brother wouldn't have died.
011:022 Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
011:023 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
011:024 Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the
        resurrection at the last day."
011:025 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
        He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.
011:026 Whoever lives and believes in me will never die.
        Do you believe this?"
011:027 She said to him, "Yes, Lord.  I have come to believe that you
        are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the world."
011:028 When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary,
        her sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here,
        and is calling you."
011:029 When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.
011:030 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place
        where Martha met him.
011:031 Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her,
        when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out,
        followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."
011:032 Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him,
        she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you would
        have been here, my brother wouldn't have died."
011:033 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping
        who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
011:034 and said, "Where have you laid him?"  They told him, "Lord,
        come and see."
011:035 Jesus wept.
011:036 The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for him!"
011:037 Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes
        of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?"
011:038 Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb.
        Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
011:039 Jesus said, "Take away the stone."  Martha, the sister of him
        who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench,
        for he has been dead four days."
011:040 Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed,
        you would see God's glory?"
011:041 So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man
        was lying.{NU omits "from the place where the dead man was
        lying."} Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I thank
        you that you listened to me.
011:042 I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude
        that stands around I said this, that they may believe that
        you sent me."
011:043 When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice,
        "Lazarus, come out!"
011:044 He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings,
        and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.  Jesus said
        to them, "Free him, and let him go."
011:045 Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did,
        believed in him.
011:046 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them
        the things which Jesus had done.
011:047 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council,
        and said, "What are we doing?  For this man does many signs.
011:048 If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him,
        and the Romans will come and take away both our place
        and our nation."
011:049 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year,
        said to them, "You know nothing at all,
011:050 nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man
        should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
011:051 Now he didn't say this of himself, but being high priest that year,
        he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
011:052 and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather
        together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
011:053 So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put
        him to death.
011:054 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews,
        but departed from there into the country near the wilderness,
        to a city called Ephraim.  He stayed there with his disciples.
011:055 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand.  Many went
        up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover,
        to purify themselves.
011:056 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another,
        as they stood in the temple, "What do you think--that he isn't
        coming to the feast at all?"
011:057 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded
        that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it,
        that they might seize him.
012:001 Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany,
        where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised
        from the dead.
012:002 So they made him a supper there.  Martha served, but Lazarus
        was one of those who sat at the table with him.
012:003 Mary, therefore, took a pound{a Roman pound of 12 ounces,
        or about 340 grams} of ointment of pure nard, very precious,
        and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair.
        The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
012:004 Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, one of his disciples,
        who would betray him, said,
012:005 "Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii,{300
        denarii was about a year's wages for an agricultural laborer.}
        and given to the poor?"
012:006 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor,
        but because he was a thief, and having the money box,
        used to steal what was put into it.
012:007 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone.  She has kept this for the day
        of my burial.
012:008 For you always have the poor with you, but you don't
        always have me."
012:009 A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there,
        and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might
        see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
012:010 But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,
012:011 because on account of him many of the Jews went away and
        believed in Jesus.
012:012 On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast.
        When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
012:013 they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to
        meet him, and cried out, "Hosanna{"Hosanna" means "save us"
        or "help us, we pray."}!  Blessed is he who comes in the name
        of the Lord,{Psalm 118:25-26} the King of Israel!"
012:014 Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it.
        As it is written,
012:015 "Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion.  Behold, your King comes,
        sitting on a donkey's colt."{Zechariah 9:9}
012:016 His disciples didn't understand these things at first,
        but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that
        these things were written about him, and that they had done
        these things to him.
012:017 The multitude therefore that was with him when he called
        Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead,
        was testifying about it.
012:018 For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they
        heard that he had done this sign.
012:019 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "See how you
        accomplish nothing.  Behold, the world has gone after him."
012:020 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship
        at the feast.
012:021 These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee,
        and asked him, saying, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."
012:022 Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip,
        and they told Jesus.
012:023 Jesus answered them, "The time has come for the Son of Man
        to be glorified.
012:024 Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls
        into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone.
        But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
012:025 He who loves his life will lose it.  He who hates his life
        in this world will keep it to eternal life.
012:026 If anyone serves me, let him follow me.  Where I am,
        there will my servant also be.  If anyone serves me,
        the Father will honor him.
012:027 "Now my soul is troubled.  What shall I say?  'Father, save me
        from this time?'  But for this cause I came to this time.
012:028 Father, glorify your name!"  Then there came a voice out
        of the sky, saying, "I have both glorified it, and will
        glorify it again."
012:029 The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it
        had thundered.  Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."
012:030 Jesus answered, "This voice hasn't come for my sake,
        but for your sakes.
012:031 Now is the judgment of this world.  Now the prince of this
        world will be cast out.
012:032 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all
        people to myself."
012:033 But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
012:034 The multitude answered him, "We have heard out of the law
        that the Christ remains forever.{Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 2:44
        (but see also Isaiah 53:8)} How do you say, 'The Son of Man
        must be lifted up?'  Who is this Son of Man?"
012:035 Jesus therefore said to them, "Yet a little while the light
        is with you.  Walk while you have the light, that darkness
        doesn't overtake you.  He who walks in the darkness doesn't
        know where he is going.
012:036 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you
        may become children of light."  Jesus said these things,
        and he departed and hid himself from them.
012:037 But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they
        didn't believe in him,
012:038 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,
        which he spoke, "Lord, who has believed our report?
        To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"{Isaiah 53:1}
012:039 For this cause they couldn't believe, for Isaiah said again,
012:040 "He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they
        should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart,
        and would turn, and I would heal them."{Isaiah 6:10}
012:041 Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke
        of him.{Isaiah 6:1}
012:042 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him,
        but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it,
        so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,
012:043 for they loved men's praise more than God's praise.
012:044 Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not
        in me, but in him who sent me.
012:045 He who sees me sees him who sent me.
012:046 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes
        in me may not remain in the darkness.
012:047 If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe,
        I don't judge him.  For I came not to judge the world,
        but to save the world.
012:048 He who rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one
        who judges him.  The word that I spoke, the same will judge
        him in the last day.
012:049 For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave
        me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
012:050 I know that his commandment is eternal life.  The things
        therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me,
        so I speak."
013:001 Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time
        had come that he would depart from this world to the Father,
        having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them
        to the end.
013:002 After supper, the devil having already put into the heart
        of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,
013:003 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,
        and that he came forth from God, and was going to God,
013:004 arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments.
        He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
013:005 Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash
        the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was
        wrapped around him.
013:006 Then he came to Simon Peter.  He said to him, "Lord, do you
        wash my feet?"
013:007 Jesus answered him, "You don't know what I am doing now,
        but you will understand later."
013:008 Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet!"
        Jesus answered him, "If I don't wash you, you have no
        part with me."
013:009 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my
        hands and my head!"
013:010 Jesus said to him, "Someone who has bathed only needs to have
        his feet washed, but is completely clean.  You are clean,
        but not all of you."
013:011 For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said,
        "You are not all clean."
013:012 So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on,
        and sat down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I
        have done to you?
013:013 You call me, 'Teacher' and 'Lord.' You say so correctly,
        for so I am.
013:014 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet,
        you also ought to wash one another's feet.
013:015 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I
        have done to you.
013:016 Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord,
        neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.
013:017 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
013:018 I don't speak concerning all of you.  I know whom I have chosen.
        But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats bread
        with me has lifted up his heel against me.'{Psalm 41:9}
013:019 From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens,
        you may believe that I am he.
013:020 Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send,
        receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me."
013:021 When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified,
        "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
013:022 The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.
013:023 One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table,
        leaning against Jesus' breast.
013:024 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him,
        "Tell us who it is of whom he speaks."
013:025 He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him,
        "Lord, who is it?"
013:026 Jesus therefore answered, "It is he to whom I will
        give this piece of bread when I have dipped it."
        So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas,
        the son of Simon Iscariot.
013:027 After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him.
        Then Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."
013:028 Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.
013:029 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus
        said to him, "Buy what things we need for the feast,"
        or that he should give something to the poor.
013:030 Therefore, having received that morsel, he went out immediately.
        It was night.
013:031 When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has
        been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.
013:032 If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him
        in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
013:033 Little children, I will be with you a little while longer.
        You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going,
        you can't come,' so now I tell you.
013:034 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another,
        just like I have loved you; that you also love one another.
013:035 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you
        have love for one another."
013:036 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?"
        Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you can't follow now,
        but you will follow afterwards."
013:037 Peter said to him, "Lord, why can't I follow you now?
        I will lay down my life for you."
013:038 Jesus answered him, "Will you lay down your life for me?
        Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won't crow until you
        have denied me three times.
014:001 "Don't let your heart be troubled.  Believe in God.
        Believe also in me.
014:002 In my Father's house are many homes.  If it weren't so,
        I would have told you.  I am going to prepare a place for you.
014:003 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
        and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may
        be there also.
014:004 Where I go, you know, and you know the way."
014:005 Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going.
        How can we know the way?"
014:006 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
        No one comes to the Father, except through me.
014:007 If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.
        From now on, you know him, and have seen him."
014:008 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will
        be enough for us."
014:009 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do
        you not know me, Philip?  He who has seen me has seen the Father.
        How do you say, 'Show us the Father?'
014:010 Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
        The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself;
        but the Father who lives in me does his works.
014:011 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me;
        or else believe me for the very works' sake.
014:012 Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works
        that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works
        than these, because I am going to my Father.
014:013 Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father
        may be glorified in the Son.
014:014 If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.
014:015 If you love me, keep my commandments.
014:016 I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another
        Counselor,{Greek Parakleton:  Counselor, Helper, Intercessor,
        Advocate, and Comfortor.} that he may be with you forever,--
014:017 the Spirit of truth, whom the world can't receive;
        for it doesn't see him, neither knows him.  You know him,
        for he lives with you, and will be in you.
014:018 I will not leave you orphans.  I will come to you.
014:019 Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more;
        but you will see me.  Because I live, you will live also.
014:020 In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me,
        and I in you.
014:021 One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one
        who loves me.  One who loves me will be loved by my Father,
        and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him."
014:022 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what has happened that you
        are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"
014:023 Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word.
        My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make
        our home with him.
014:024 He who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words.  The word
        which you hear isn't mine, but the Father's who sent me.
014:025 I have said these things to you, while still living with you.
014:026 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send
        in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind
        you of all that I said to you.
014:027 Peace I leave with you.  My peace I give to you; not as the
        world gives, give I to you.  Don't let your heart be troubled,
        neither let it be fearful.
014:028 You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.'
        If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said 'I
        am going to my Father;' for the Father is greater than I.
014:029 Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens,
        you may believe.
014:030 I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes,
        and he has nothing in me.
014:031 But that the world may know that I love the Father,
        and as the Father commanded me, even so I do.  Arise, let us
        go from here.
015:001 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.
015:002 Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, he takes away.
        Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may
        bear more fruit.
015:003 You are already pruned clean because of the word which I
        have spoken to you.
015:004 Remain in me, and I in you.  As the branch can't bear fruit
        by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you,
        unless you remain in me.
015:005 I am the vine.  You are the branches.  He who remains in me,
        and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me
        you can do nothing.
015:006 If a man doesn't remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch,
        and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire,
        and they are burned.
015:007 If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask
        whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.
015:008 "In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit;
        and so you will be my disciples.
015:009 Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you.
        Remain in my love.
015:010 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love;
        even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and remain
        in his love.
015:011 I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you,
        and that your joy may be made full.
015:012 "This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I
        have loved you.
015:013 Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his
        life for his friends.
015:014 You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
015:015 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn't
        know what his lord does.  But I have called you friends,
        for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made
        known to you.
015:016 You didn't choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you
        should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain;
        that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name,
        he may give it to you.
015:017 "I command these things to you, that you may love one another.
015:018 If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before
        it hated you.
015:019 If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
        But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out
        of the world, therefore the world hates you.
015:020 Remember the word that I said to you:  'A servant is not
        greater than his lord.'{John 13:16} If they persecuted me,
        they will also persecute you.  If they kept my word,
        they will keep yours also.
015:021 But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake,
        because they don't know him who sent me.
015:022 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin;
        but now they have no excuse for their sin.
015:023 He who hates me, hates my Father also.
015:024 If I hadn't done among them the works which no one else did,
        they wouldn't have had sin.  But now have they seen and also
        hated both me and my Father.
015:025 But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled
        which was written in their law, 'They hated me without
        a cause.'{Psalms 35:19; 69:4}
015:026 "When the Counselor{Greek Parakletos:  Counselor, Helper,
        Advocate, Intercessor, and Comfortor.} has come, whom I
        will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth,
        who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.
015:027 You will also testify, because you have been with me
        from the beginning.
016:001 "These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn't
        be caused to stumble.
016:002 They will put you out of the synagogues.  Yes, the time comes
        that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.
016:003 They will do these things{TR adds "to you"} because they
        have not known the Father, nor me.
016:004 But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes,
        you may remember that I told you about them.  I didn't tell
        you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
016:005 But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me,
        'Where are you going?'
016:006 But because I have told you these things, sorrow has
        filled your heart.
016:007 Nevertheless I tell you the truth:  It is to your advantage that I
        go away, for if I don't go away, the Counselor won't come to you.
        But if I go, I will send him to you.
016:008 When he has come, he will convict the world about sin,
        about righteousness, and about judgment;
016:009 about sin, because they don't believe in me;
016:010 about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you
        won't see me any more;
016:011 about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
016:012 "I have yet many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now.
016:013 However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide
        you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself;
        but whatever he hears, he will speak.  He will declare to you
        things that are coming.
016:014 He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine,
        and will declare it to you.
016:015 All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said
        that he takes{TR reads "will take" instead of "takes"} of mine,
        and will declare it to you.
016:016 A little while, and you will not see me.  Again a little while,
        and you will see me."
016:017 Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, "What is
        this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me,
        and again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I
        go to the Father?'"
016:018 They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A little while?'
        We don't know what he is saying."
016:019 Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said
        to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this,
        that I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again
        a little while, and you will see me?'
016:020 Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament,
        but the world will rejoice.  You will be sorrowful, but your
        sorrow will be turned into joy.
016:021 A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come.
        But when she has delivered the child, she doesn't remember
        the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born
        into the world.
016:022 Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again,
        and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy
        away from you.
016:023 "In that day you will ask me no questions.  Most certainly
        I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name,
        he will give it to you.
016:024 Until now, you have asked nothing in my name.  Ask, and you
        will receive, that your joy may be made full.
016:025 I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech.
        But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in
        figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
016:026 In that day you will ask in my name; and I don't say to you,
        that I will pray to the Father for you,
016:027 for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me,
        and have believed that I came forth from God.
016:028 I came out from the Father, and have come into the world.
        Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
016:029 His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you speak plainly,
        and speak no figures of speech.
016:030 Now we know that you know all things, and don't need for
        anyone to question you.  By this we believe that you came
        forth from God."
016:031 Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?
016:032 Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you
        will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will
        leave me alone.  Yet I am not alone, because the Father
        is with me.
016:033 I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace.
        In the world you have oppression; but cheer up!
        I have overcome the world."
017:001 Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven,
        he said, "Father, the time has come.  Glorify your Son,
        that your Son may also glorify you;
017:002 even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give
        eternal life to all whom you have given him.
017:003 This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God,
        and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.
017:004 I glorified you on the earth.  I have accomplished the work
        which you have given me to do.
017:005 Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory
        which I had with you before the world existed.
017:006 I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out
        of the world.  They were yours, and you have given them to me.
        They have kept your word.
017:007 Now they have known that all things whatever you have given
        me are from you,
017:008 for the words which you have given me I have given to them,
        and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth
        from you, and they have believed that you sent me.
017:009 I pray for them.  I don't pray for the world, but for those whom
        you have given me, for they are yours.
017:010 All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine,
        and I am glorified in them.
017:011 I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
        and I am coming to you.  Holy Father, keep them through
        your name which you have given me, that they may be one,
        even as we are.
017:012 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name.
        Those whom you have given me I have kept.  None of them
        is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture
        might be fulfilled.
017:013 But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world,
        that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
017:014 I have given them your word.  The world hated them, because they
        are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
017:015 I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you
        would keep them from the evil one.
017:016 They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
017:017 Sanctify them in your truth.  Your word is truth.{Psalm 119:142}
017:018 As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them
        into the world.
017:019 For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves
        also may be sanctified in truth.
017:020 Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe
        in me through their word,
017:021 that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me,
        and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world
        may believe that you sent me.
017:022 The glory which you have given me, I have given to them;
        that they may be one, even as we are one;
017:023 I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one;
        that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them,
        even as you loved me.
017:024 Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me
        where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me,
        for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
017:025 Righteous Father, the world hasn't known you, but I knew you;
        and these knew that you sent me.
017:026 I made known to them your name, and will make it known;
        that the love with which you loved me may be in them,
        and I in them."
018:001 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his
        disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden,
        into which he and his disciples entered.
018:002 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus
        often met there with his disciples.
018:003 Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers
        from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there
        with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
018:004 Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him,
        went forth, and said to them, "Who are you looking for?"
018:005 They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth."  Jesus said to them,
        "I am he."  Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
018:006 When therefore he said to them, "I am he," they went backward,
        and fell to the ground.
018:007 Again therefore he asked them, "Who are you looking for?"
        They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
018:008 Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he.  If therefore you
        seek me, let these go their way,"
018:009 that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, "Of those whom
        you have given me, I have lost none."{John 6:39}
018:010 Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck
        the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear.
        The servant's name was Malchus.
018:011 Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put the sword into its sheath.
        The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not
        surely drink it?"
018:012 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers
        of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
018:013 and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas,
        who was high priest that year.
018:014 Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient
        that one man should perish for the people.
018:015 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple.
        Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered
        in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
018:016 but Peter was standing at the door outside.  So the other disciple,
        who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her
        who kept the door, and brought in Peter.
018:017 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you
        also one of this man's disciples?"  He said, "I am not."
018:018 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made
        a fire of coals, for it was cold.  They were warming themselves.
        Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.
018:019 The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples,
        and about his teaching.
018:020 Jesus answered him, "I spoke openly to the world.  I always taught
        in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet.
        I said nothing in secret.
018:021 Why do you ask me?  Ask those who have heard me what I said
        to them.  Behold, these know the things which I said."
018:022 When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped
        Jesus with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high
        priest like that?"
018:023 Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil;
        but if well, why do you beat me?"
018:024 Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.
018:025 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.  They said
        therefore to him, "You aren't also one of his disciples, are you?"
        He denied it, and said, "I am not."
018:026 One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative
        of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you
        in the garden with him?"
018:027 Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
018:028 They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium.
        It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium,
        that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
018:029 Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation
        do you bring against this man?"
018:030 They answered him, "If this man weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't
        have delivered him up to you."
018:031 Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge
        him according to your law."  Therefore the Jews said to him,
        "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"
018:032 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke,
        signifying by what kind of death he should die.
018:033 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus,
        and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
018:034 Jesus answered him, "Do you say this by yourself, or did others
        tell you about me?"
018:035 Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I?  Your own nation and
        the chief priests delivered you to me.  What have you done?"
018:036 Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world.
        If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants
        would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews.
        But now my Kingdom is not from here."
018:037 Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?"
        Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king.  For this
        reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come
        into the world, that I should testify to the truth.
        Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
018:038 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"  When he had said this,
        he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find
        no basis for a charge against him.
018:039 But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you
        at the Passover.  Therefore do you want me to release to you
        the King of the Jews?"
018:040 Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man,
        but Barabbas!"  Now Barabbas was a robber.
019:001 So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him.
019:002 The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head,
        and dressed him in a purple garment.
019:003 They kept saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and they
        kept slapping him.
019:004 Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I bring
        him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis
        for a charge against him."
019:005 Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and
        the purple garment.  Pilate said to them, "Behold, the man!"
019:006 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him,
        they shouted, saying, "Crucify!  Crucify!"  Pilate said to them,
        "Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis
        for a charge against him."
019:007 The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he ought
        to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
019:008 When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.
019:009 He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are
        you from?"  But Jesus gave him no answer.
019:010 Pilate therefore said to him, "Aren't you speaking to me?
        Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power
        to crucify you?"
019:011 Jesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me,
        unless it were given to you from above.  Therefore he who
        delivered me to you has greater sin."
019:012 At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out,
        saying, "If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's friend!
        Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"
019:013 When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out,
        and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The Pavement,"
        but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."
019:014 Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth
        hour.{noon} He said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
019:015 They cried out, "Away with him!  Away with him!  Crucify him!"
        Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"  The chief
        priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"
019:016 So then he delivered him to them to be crucified.
        So they took Jesus and led him away.
019:017 He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called "The Place
        of a Skull," which is called in Hebrew, "Golgotha,"
019:018 where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either
        side one, and Jesus in the middle.
019:019 Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross.
        There was written, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
019:020 Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place
        where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written
        in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
019:021 The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write,
        'The King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.'"
019:022 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
019:023 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments
        and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat.
        Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
019:024 Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast lots
        for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might
        be fulfilled, which says, "They parted my garments among them.
        For my cloak they cast lots."{Psalm 22:18} Therefore the soldiers
        did these things.
019:025 But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother,
        and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,
        and Mary Magdalene.
019:026 Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom
        he loved standing there, he said to his mother, "Woman,
        behold your son!"
019:027 Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!"
        From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.
019:028 After this, Jesus, seeing{NU, TR read "knowing" instead of
        "seeing"} that all things were now finished, that the Scripture
        might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."
019:029 Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge
        full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.
019:030 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,
        "It is finished."  He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
019:031 Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day,
        so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath
        (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their
        legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
019:032 Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first,
        and of the other who was crucified with him;
019:033 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead,
        they didn't break his legs.
019:034 However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear,
        and immediately blood and water came out.
019:035 He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true.
        He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.
019:036 For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
        "A bone of him will not be broken."{Exodus 12:46;
        Numbers 9:12; Psalm 34:20}
019:037 Again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom
        they pierced."{Zechariah 12:10}
019:038 After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple
        of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate
        that he might take away Jesus' body.  Pilate gave him permission.
        He came therefore and took away his body.
019:039 Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came
        bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred
        pounds.{100 Roman pounds of 12 ounces each, or about 72 pounds,
        or 33 Kilograms.}
019:040 So they took Jesus' body, and bound it in linen cloths with
        the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
019:041 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden.
        In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever
        yet been laid.
019:042 Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was
        near at hand) they laid Jesus there.
020:001 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early,
        while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken
        away from the tomb.
020:002 Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other
        disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken
        away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they
        have laid him!"
020:003 Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went
        toward the tomb.
020:004 They both ran together.  The other disciple outran Peter,
        and came to the tomb first.
020:005 Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying,
        yet he didn't enter in.
020:006 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb.
        He saw the linen cloths lying,
020:007 and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with
        the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
020:008 So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also
        entered in, and he saw and believed.
020:009 For as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise
        from the dead.
020:010 So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
020:011 But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping.  So, as she wept,
        she stooped and looked into the tomb,
020:012 and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head,
        and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
020:013 They told her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"  She said to them,
        "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know
        where they have laid him."
020:014 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing,
        and didn't know that it was Jesus.
020:015 Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?
        Who are you looking for?"  She, supposing him to be the gardener,
        said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me
        where you have laid him, and I will take him away."
020:016 Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him, "Rhabbouni!"
        which is to say, "Teacher!"
020:017 Jesus said to her, "Don't touch me, for I haven't yet
        ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them,
        'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God
        and your God.'"
020:018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen
        the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
020:019 When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week,
        and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled,
        for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst,
        and said to them, "Peace be to you."
020:020 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.
        The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.
020:021 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you.
        As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."
020:022 When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them,
        "Receive the Holy Spirit!
020:023 Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven them.
        Whoever's sins you retain, they have been retained."
020:024 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them
        when Jesus came.
020:025 The other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen
        the Lord!"  But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands
        the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side,
        I will not believe."
020:026 After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas
        was with them.  Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood
        in the midst, and said, "Peace be to you."
020:027 Then he said to Thomas, "Reach here your finger, and see
        my hands.  Reach here your hand, and put it into my side.
        Don't be unbelieving, but believing."
020:028 Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"
020:029 Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me,{TR adds "
        Thomas,"} you have believed.  Blessed are those who have not seen,
        and have believed."
020:030 Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of
        his disciples, which are not written in this book;
020:031 but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is
        the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have
        life in his name.
021:001 After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples
        at the sea of Tiberias.  He revealed himself this way.
021:002 Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana
        in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his
        disciples were together.
021:003 Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing."
        They told him, "We are also coming with you."
        They immediately went out, and entered into the boat.
        That night, they caught nothing.
021:004 But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach,
        yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.
021:005 Jesus therefore said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?"
        They answered him, "No."
021:006 He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat,
        and you will find some."  They cast it therefore, and now they
        weren't able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.
021:007 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's
        the Lord!"  So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
        he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw
        himself into the sea.
021:008 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they
        were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits{200
        cubits is about 100 yards or about 91 meters} away),
        dragging the net full of fish.
021:009 So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there,
        and fish laid on it, and bread.
021:010 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you
        have just caught."
021:011 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish,
        one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many,
        the net wasn't torn.
021:012 Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast."
        None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?"
        knowing that it was the Lord.
021:013 Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them,
        and the fish likewise.
021:014 This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples,
        after he had risen from the dead.
021:015 So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to
        Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?"
        He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."
        He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
021:016 He said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of Jonah,
        do you love me?"  He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I
        have affection for you."  He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
021:017 He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you
        have affection for me?"  Peter was grieved because he asked
        him the third time, "Do you have affection for me?"
        He said to him, "Lord, you know everything.  You know that I
        have affection for you."  Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.
021:018 Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself,
        and walked where you wanted to.  But when you are old,
        you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you,
        and carry you where you don't want to go."
021:019 Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would
        glorify God.  When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."
021:020 Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following.
        This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved,
        the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper
        and asked, "Lord, who is going to betray You?"
021:021 Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?"
021:022 Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come,
        what is that to you?  You follow me."
021:023 This saying therefore went out among the brothers{The word
        for "brothers" here may be also correctly translated "brothers
        and sisters" or "siblings."}, that this disciple wouldn't die.
        Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, "If I
        desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?"
021:024 This is the disciple who testifies about these things,
        and wrote these things.  We know that his witness is true.
021:025 There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they
        would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself
        wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.
