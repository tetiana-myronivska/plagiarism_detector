Use copper sulphate (bluestone) 5 pounds; quick-lime (good stone lime),
6 pounds; water, 50 gallons. Put the bluestone in a sack and hang it so
it will be suspended just under the surface of a barrel of water over
night, or dissolve in hot water. Use one gallon of water to one pound of
bluestone. Slake the lime in a separate barrel, using just enough water
to make a smooth, clean, thin whitewash. Stir this vigorously. Use
wooden vessels only. Fill the spray tank half full of water, add one
gallon of bluestone solution for each pound required, then strain in the
lime and the remainder of the water and stir thoroughly. The formula may
be varied according to conditions, using from 3 to 8 pounds of bluestone
to 50 gallons of water and an equal or slight excess of lime. Use the
stronger mixture in rainy weather. Keep the mixture constantly agitated
while applying.



Formula for Lime-Sulphur.



To make lime-sulphur take quick-lime, 20 pounds; ground sulphur, 15
pounds and water 30 gallons. Slake the lime with hot water in a large
kettle, add the sulphur and stir well together. After the violent
slaking subsides add more water and boil the mixture over a fire for at
least one hour. After boiling sufficiently strain into the spray tank
and dilute with water to the proper strength. If a steam boiler is
available, this mixture may be prepared more easily on a large scale by
cooking in barrels into which steam pipes are introduced. This mixture
cannot be applied safely except during the winter when the trees are
dormant. A large proportion of the lime-sulphur used in the State is
purchased already prepared in more concentrated form.
