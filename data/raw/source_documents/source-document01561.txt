@2070  Disputes - international


Afghanistan
  despite largely successful UN efforts at voluntary
  repatriation, 2-3 million Afghan refugees continue to reside in Iran
  and Pakistan, many at their own choosing; Pakistan has sent troops
  into remote tribal areas to control the border and stem organized
  terrorist and other illegal cross-border activites; regular meetings
  between Pakistani and coalition allies aim to resolve periodic
  claims of boundary encroachments; occasional conflicts over
  water-sharing arrangements with Amu Darya and Helmand River states

Albania
  the Albanian Government calls for the protection of the
  rights of ethnic Albanians in neighboring countries, and the
  peaceful resolution of interethnic disputes; some ethnic Albanian
  groups in neighboring countries advocate for a "greater Albania,"
  but the idea has little appeal among Albanian nationals

Algeria
  Algeria supports the exiled Sahrawi Polisario Front and
  rejects Moroccan administration of Western Sahara; Algeria's border
  with Morocco remains an irritant to bilateral relations; each nation
  has accused the other of harboring militants and arms smuggling; in
  an attempt to improve relations afer unilaterally imposing a visa
  requirement on Algerians in the early 1990s, Morocco lifted the
  requirement in mid-2004 - a gesture not reciprocated by Algeria;
  Algeria remains concerned about armed bandits operating throughout
  the Sahel who sometimes destabilize southern Algerian towns; dormant
  disputes include Libyan claims of about 32,000 sq km still reflected
  on its maps of southeastern Algeria and the FLN's assertions of a
  claim to Chirac Pastures in southeastern Morocco

American Samoa
  none

Andorra
  none

Angola
  continues to give shelter to refugees from the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo while many Angolan refugees and Cabinda
  exclave secessionists reside in neighboring states

Anguilla
  none

Antarctica
  Antarctic Treaty freezes claims (see Antarctic Treaty
  Summary in Government type entry); sections (some overlapping)
  claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, NZ, Norway, and UK;
  the US and most other states do not recognize the territorial claims
  of other states and have made no claims themselves (the US and
  Russia reserve the right to do so); no claims have been made in the
  sector between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west; several states
  with land claims in Antarctica have expressed their intention to
  submit data to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental
  Shelf to extend their continental shelf claims to adjoining undersea
  ridges

Antigua and Barbuda
  none

Arctic Ocean
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)

Argentina
  UK continues to reject sovereignty talks requested by

  Islands (Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich
  Islands, but in 1995 ceded the right to settle the dispute by force;
  Beagle Channel islands dispute resolved through Papal mediation in
  1984, but armed incidents persist since 1992 oil discovery;
  territorial claim in Antarctica partially overlaps UK and Chilean
  claims (see Antarctic disputes); unruly region at convergence of
  Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay borders is locus of money laundering,
  smuggling, arms and drug trafficking, and fundraising for extremist
  organizations; uncontested dispute between Brazil and Uruguay over
  Braziliera Island in the Quarai/Cuareim River leaves the tripoint
  with Argentina in question

Armenia
  Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in
  Nagorno-Karabakh and militarily occupies 16% of Azerbaijan -
  Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) continues
  to mediate dispute; border with Turkey remains closed over
  Nagorno-Karabakh dispute; traditional demands regarding former
  Armenian lands in Turkey have subsided; ethnic Armenian groups in
  Javakheti region of Georgia seek greater autonomy from the new
  Georgian Government

Aruba
  none

Ashmore and Cartier Islands
  Indonesian groups challenge Australia's
  claim to Ashmore Reef; Australia has closed the surrounding waters
  to Indonesian traditional fishing and has created a national park in
  the region while continuing to prospect for hydrocarbons in the
  vicinity

Atlantic Ocean
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)

Australia
  the 1999 maritime delimitation established partial
  maritime boundaries with East Timor over part of the Timor Gap but
  temporary resource-sharing agreements over an unreconciled area
  grant Australia 90% share of exploited gas reserves and hamper
  creation of a southern maritime boundary with Indonesia (see Ashmore
  and Cartier Islands disputes); Australia asserts a territorial claim
  to Antarctica and to its continental shelf (see Antarctica)

Austria
  minor disputes with the Czech Republic over the Temelin
  Nuclear Power Plant

Azerbaijan
  Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in
  Nagorno-Karabakh and militarily occupies about one-sixth of
  Azerbaijan - Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
  (OSCE) continues to mediate dispute; Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and
  Russia ratify Caspian seabed delimitation treaties based on
  equidistance, while Iran continues to insist on an even one-fifth
  allocation and challenges Azerbaijan's hydrocarbon exploration in
  disputed waters; talks resume with Turkmenistan on dividing the
  seabed in 2004 as both sides await an ICJ decision on contested
  oilfields in the middle of the Caspian; Azerbaijan protests Georgian
  constructions at the Red Bridge crossing and several other small

  to fence off high-traffic sections of the porous boundary; dispute
  with India over New Moore/South Talpatty/Purbasha Island in the Bay
  of Bengal deters maritime boundary delimitation; Burmese Muslim
  refugees strain Bangladesh's meager resources

Barbados
  Barbados intends to take its claim before UNCLOS
  arbitration that the northern limit of Trinidad and Tobago's
  maritime boundary with Venezuela extends into its waters; joins
  other Caribbean states to counter Venezuela's claim that Aves Island
  sustains human habitation, a criterion under UNCLOS, which permits
  Venezuela to extend its EEZ/continental shelf over a large portion
  of the Caribbean Sea

Bassas da India
  claimed by Madagascar

Belarus
  1997 boundary treaty with Ukraine remains unratified over
  unresolved financial claims, preventing demarcation and diminishing
  border security; boundaries with Latvia and Lithuania remain
  undemarcated despite European Union financial support

Belgium
  none

Belize
  Guatemalan squatters continue to settle along the border
  region; an OAS brokered Differendum in 2002 created a small
  adjustment to the land boundary, a large Guatemalan maritime
  corridor in Caribbean, a joint ecological park for disputed
  Sapodilla Cays, and a substantial US-UK financial package, but
  agreement was not brought to popular referendum leaving Guatemala to
  continue to claim the southern half of Belize

Benin
  two villages remain in dispute along the border with Burkina
  Faso; accuses Burkina Faso of moving boundary pillars; much of
  Benin-Niger boundary, including tripoint with Nigeria, remains
  undemarcated, and ICJ ad hoc judges have been selected to rule on

  at the base of Mount Pljesevica

Botswana
  established a commission with Namibia to resolve small
  residual disputes along the Caprivi Strip, including the Situngu
  marshlands along the Linyanti River; downstream Botswana residents
  protest Namibia's planned construction of the Okavango hydroelectric
  dam at Popavalle (Popa Falls); Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and
  Zimbabwe boundary convergence is not clearly defined or delimited

Bouvet Island
  none

Brazil
  unruly region at convergence of Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay
  borders is locus of money laundering, smuggling, arms and drug
  trafficking, and fundraising for extremist organizations;
  uncontested dispute with Uruguay over certain islands in the
  Quarai/Cuareim and Invernada boundary streams and the resulting
  tripoint with Argentina

British Indian Ocean Territory
  Mauritius and Seychelles claim the
  Chagos Archipelago and its former inhabitants, who reside chiefly in
  Mauritius, but in 2001 were granted UK citizenship and the right to
  repatriation since eviction in 1965; the UK resists the Chagossians'
  demand for an immediate return to the islands; repatriation is
  complicated by the exclusive US military lease of Diego Garcia that
  restricted access to the largest island in the chain

British Virgin Islands
  none

Brunei
  in 2003 Brunei and Malaysia ceased gas and oil exploration in
  their offshore and deepwater seabeds until negotiations progress to
  an agreement over allocation of disputed areas; Malaysia's land
  boundary with Brunei around Limbang is in dispute; Brunei
  established an exclusive economic fishing zone encompassing Louisa
  Reef in southern Spratly Islands in 1984 but makes no public
  territorial claim to the offshore reefs; the 2002 "Declaration on

  conduct" desired by several of the disputants

Bulgaria
  none

Burkina Faso
  two villages are in dispute along the border with
  Benin; Benin accuses Burkina Faso of moving boundary pillars;
  Burkina Faso border regions have become a staging area for Liberia
  and Cote d'Ivoire rebels and an asylum for refugees caught in
  regional fighting; the Ivoirian Government accuses Burkina Faso of
  supporting Ivoirian rebels

Burma

  differences remain with Thailand over boundary alignment and the
  handling of ethnic rebels, refugees, and illegal cross-border
  activities; groups in Burma and Thailand express concern over
  China's construction of 13 hydroelectric dams on the Salween River
  in Yunnan Province; India seeks cooperation from Burma to keep out
  Indian Nagaland insurgents

Burundi
  Tutsi, Hutu, and other conflicting ethnic groups, associated
  political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces
  continue fighting in the Great Lakes region, transcending the
  boundaries of Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and
  Uganda to gain control over populated and natural resource areas;
  government heads pledge to end conflict, but localized violence
  continues despite UN peacekeeping efforts

Cambodia
  land boundary disputes persist among Cambodian claims that
  Thailand and Vietnam moved or destroyed boundary markers; maritime
  boundary with Vietnam is hampered by dispute over offshore islands;
  Cambodia periodically accuses Thailand of obstructing access to
  Preah Vihear temple ruins awarded to Cambodia by ICJ decision in
  1962; 2003 anti-Thai riots in Phnom Penh resulted in the destruction
  of the Thai Embassy, damage to 17 Thai-owned businesses, and
  disputes over full payment of compensation

Cameroon
  ICJ ruled in 2002 on the entire Cameroon-Nigeria land and
  maritime boundary but the parties formed a Joint Border Commission
  to resolve differences bilaterally and have commenced with
  demarcation in less-contested sections of the boundary, starting in
  Lake Chad in the north; the ICF ruled on an equidistance settlement
  of Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf
  of Guinea, however, implementation of the decision is delayed due to
  imprecisely defined coordinates, the unresolved Bakasi allocation,
  and a sovereignty dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon
  over an island at the mouth of the Ntem River; Nigeria initially
  rejected cession of the Bakasi Peninsula; Lake Chad Commission
  continues to urge signatories Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria to
  ratify delimitation treaty over the lake region, which remains the
  site of armed clashes among local populations and militias

Canada
  managed maritime boundary disputes with the US at Dixon

  border patrols, leaving refugees and rebel groups in both countries;
  Chad serves as an important mediator in the Sudanese civil conflict;
  Chadian Aozou rebels reside in southern Libya; Lake Chad Commission
  continues to urge signatories Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria to
  ratify delimitation treaty over lake region; Chad rejects Nigerian

  persist since 1992 oil discovery; territorial claim in Antarctica
  (Chilean Antarctic Territory) partially overlaps Argentine and
  British claims

China
  involved in complex dispute with Malaysia, Philippines,
  Taiwan, Vietnam, and possibly Brunei over the Spratly Islands; the
  2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea"
  has eased tensions but falls short of a legally binding "code of
  conduct" desired by several of the disputants; most of the rugged,
  militarized boundary with India is in dispute, but the two sides are
  committed to begin resolution with discussions on the least disputed
  Middle Sector; Kashmir remains the world's largest and highly
  militarized territorial dispute with portions under the de facto
  administration of China (Aksai Chin), India (Jammu and Kashmir), and
  Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern Areas), but recent discussion
  and confidence-building measures among parties are beginning to
  defuse tensions, India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding lands to
  China in a 1964 boundary agreement; China and Taiwan continue to
  assert their claims to the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands
  (Diaoyu Tai) with increased media coverage and protest actions;
  certain islands in Yalu and Tumen rivers are in an uncontested
  dispute with North Korea and a section of boundary around Mount
  Paektu is indefinite - China has been attempting to manage illegal
  migration of North Koreans into northern China; China and Russia in
  2004 resolved their last border dispute over islands in the Amur and
  Argun Rivers, but details on demarcation have not yet been
  worked-out; boundary delimitation agreements signed in 2002 with
  Tajikistan cedes 1,000 sq km of Pamir Mountain range to China in
  return for China's relinquishing claims to 28,000 sq km, but
  demarcation has not commenced; agreements with Vietnam demarcating
  maritime boundaries and fisheries cooperation in the Gulf of Tonkin
  were ratified in June, and demarcation of the land boundary
  continues; China occupies some of the Paracel Islands also claimed
  by Vietnam and Taiwan; in response to groups in Burma and Thailand
  expressing concern over China's plans to construct 13 hydroelectric
  dams on the Nu River in Yunnan Province (Salween River in Burma),
  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao suspended the project to conduct an
  environmental impact assessment, a smaller scale version of only 4
  dams is now scheduled to move forward

  Ivorian Government accuses Burkina Faso and Liberia of supporting
  Ivorian rebels

Croatia
  discussions continue with Bosnia and Herzegovina over
  disputed territory around Kostajnica on the Una River and villages
  at the base of Mount Pljesevica; the Croatia-Slovenia land and
  maritime boundary agreement, which would have ceded most of Pirin
  Bay and maritime access to Slovenia and several villages to Croatia,
  remains controversial, has not been ratified, and has been
  complicated by Croatia's declaration of an ecological-fisheries zone
  in the Adriatic Sea

Cuba
  US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay is leased to US and only mutual
  agreement or US abandonment of the area can terminate the lease

Cyprus
  hostilities in 1974 divided the island into two de facto

  meet, survey, and delimit the land boundary, but several sections of
  the boundary especially around the Oekussi enclave remain
  unresolved; Indonesia and East Timor contest the sovereignty of the
  uninhabited coral island of Palau Batek/Fatu Sinai, which may delay
  decision on the northern maritime boundaries; numbers of East Timor
  refugees in Indonesia refuse repatriation; East Timor and Australia
  continue to disagree over the delimitation of a permanent maritime
  boundary and over the sharing of petroleum resources that fall

  counter Venezuela's claim that Aves Island sustains human
  habitation, a criterion under UNCLOS, which permits Venezuela to
  extend its EEZ/continental shelf over a large portion of the
  Caribbean Sea

Samoa
  none

San Marino
  none

Sao Tome and Principe
  none

Saudi Arabia
  nomadic groups on border region with Yemen resist
  demarcation of boundary; Yemen protests Saudi erection of a
  concrete-filled pipe as a security barrier in 2004 to stem illegal
  cross-border activities in sections of the boundary; Kuwait and
  Saudi Arabia continue discussions on a maritime boundary with Iran;
  because the treaties have not been made public, the exact alignment
  of the boundary with the UAE is still unknown and labeled approximate

Senegal
  The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau attempt to stem refugees, cross
  border raids, arms smuggling, and political instability from a
  separatist movement in Senegal's Casamance region

Serbia and Montenegro
  the future status of Kosovo remains an
  unresolved issue in South Central Europe with Kosovo Albanians
  overwhelmingly supporting and Serbian officials opposing Kosovo
  independence; the international community has agreed to begin a
  process to determine final status only after significant progress
  has been made in solidifying multi-ethnic democracy in Kosovo as
  outlined in the policy of "standards before status"; the Contact
  group (including the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia)
  will review progress on the UNMIK standard around mid-2005; ethnic
  Albanians in Kosovo resist demarcation of the F.Y.R.O.M. boundary in
  accordance with the 2000 delimitation treaty, which transfers on net
  a small amount of land to F.Y.R.O.M.; Serbia and Montenegro have
  delimited about half of the boundary with Bosnia and Herzegovina,
  but sections along the Drina River remain in dispute

Seychelles
  together with Mauritius, Seychelles claims the Chagos
  Archipelago (UK-administered British Indian Ocean Territory)

Sierra Leone
  domestic fighting among disparate rebel groups,
  warlords, and youth gangs in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have
  created insurgencies, street violence, looting, arms trafficking,
  ethnic conflicts, and refugees in border areas; in 2003, Guinea and
  Sierra Leone established a boundary commission to resolve a dispute
  over the town of Yenga

Singapore
  disputes with Malaysia over deliveries of fresh water to
  Singapore, Singapore's land reclamation works, bridge construction,
  maritime boundaries, and Pedra Branca Island/Pulau Batu Putih
  persist - parties agree to ICJ arbitration on island dispute within
  three years

Slovakia
  Hungary amended its status law extending special social and
  cultural benefits to ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia, many of whom had
  protested the law; Slovakia and Hungary have renewed discussions on
  ways to resolve differences over the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros
  hydroelectric dam on the Danube, with possible resort again to the
  ICJ for final resolution

Slovenia
  the Croatia-Slovenia land and maritime boundary agreement,
  which would have ceded most of Piran Bay and maritime access to
  Slovenia and several villages to Croatia, remains controversial, has
  not been ratified, and has been complicated by Croatia's declaration
  of an ecological-fisheries zone in the Adriatic Sea

Solomon Islands
  Australian defense personnel are dispatched at the
  invitation of the Solomon Islands' Government to restore law and
  order on the islands and reinforce regional security

Somalia
  "Somaliland" secessionists provide port facilities to
  land-locked Ethiopia and establish commercial ties with regional
  states; "Puntland" secessionists clash with "Somaliland"
  secessionists to establish territorial limits and clan loyalties,
  each seeking support from neighboring states; Ethiopia maintains
  only an administrative line with the Oromo region of southern
  Somalia and maintains alliances with local Somali clans opposed to
  the unrecognized Transitional National Government in Mogadishu

South Africa
  managed dispute with Namibia over the location of the
  boundary in the Orange River

South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands
  briefly occupied by
  military force in 1982 - claimed by Argentina in constitution but
  declares it will no longer seek settlement by force

Southern Ocean
  Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctica
  entry), but Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, NZ, Norway, and UK
  assert claims (some overlapping), including the continental shelf in
  the Southern Ocean; several states have expressed an interest in
  extending those continental shelf claims under the United Nations
  Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to include undersea
  ridges; the US and most other states do not recognize the land or
  maritime claims of other states and have made no claims themselves
  (the US and Russia have reserved the right to do so); no formal
  claims have been made in the sector between 90 degrees west and 150
  degrees west

Spain
  since Gibraltar residents voted overwhelmingly by referendum
  in 2003 against a "total shared sovereignty" arrangement, talks
  between the UK and Spain over the fate of the 300-year old UK colony
  have stalled; Spain disapproves of UK plans to grant Gibraltar
  greater autonomy; Morocco protests Spain's control over the coastal
  enclaves of Ceuta, Melilla, and the islands of Penon de Velez de la
  Gomera, Penon de Alhucemas and Islas Chafarinas, and surrounding
  waters; Morocco serves as the primary launching area of illegal
  migration into Spain from North Africa; Morocco rejected Spain's
  unilateral designation of a median line from the Canary Islands in
  2002 to set limits to undersea resource exploration and refugee
  interdiction, but agreed in 2003 to discuss a comprehensive maritime
  delimitation; some Portuguese groups assert dormant claims to
  territories ceded to Spain around the town of Olivenza

Spratly Islands
  all of the Spratly Islands are claimed by China,
  Taiwan, and Vietnam; parts of them are claimed by Malaysia and the
  Philippines; in 1984, Brunei established an exclusive fishing zone
  that encompasses Louisa Reef in the southern Spratly Islands but has
  not publicly claimed the reef; claimants in November 2002 signed the
  "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea,"
  which has eased tensions but falls short of a legally binding "code
  of conduct"

Sri Lanka
  none

Sudan
  the north-south civil war has affected Sudan's neighbors by
  drawing them into the fighting and by forcing them to provide
  shelter to refugees, to contend with infiltration by rebel groups,
  and to serve as mediators; Sudan has provided shelter to Ugandan
  refugees and cover to Lord's Resistance Army soldiers; Sudan accuses
  Eritrea of supporting Sudanese rebel groups; efforts to demarcate
  the porous boundary with Ethiopia have been delayed by fighting in
  Sudan; Kenya's administrative boundary still extends into the Sudan,
  creating the "Ilemi Triangle"; Egypt and Sudan retain claims to
  administer the triangular areas that extend north and south of the
  1899 Treaty boundary along the 22nd Parallel, but have withdrawn
  their military presence; Egypt is economically developing and
  currently effectively administers the "Hala'ib Triangle" north of
  the Treaty Line; Sudan has pledged to work with the Central African
  Republic to stem violent skirmishes over water and grazing among
  related pastoral populations along the border

Suriname
  area claimed by French Guiana between Riviere Litani and
  Riviere Marouini (both headwaters of the Lawa); Suriname claims a
  triangle of land between the New and Kutari/Koetari Rivers in a
  historic dispute over the headwaters of the Courantyne; Guyana seeks
  UNCLOS arbitration to resolve the long-standing dispute with
  Suriname over the axis of the territorial sea boundary in
  potentially oil-rich waters

Taiwan
  involved in complex dispute with China, Malaysia,
  Philippines, Vietnam, and possibly Brunei over the Spratly Islands;
  the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China
  Sea" has eased tensions but falls short of a legally binding "code
  of conduct" desired by several of the disputants; Paracel Islands
  are occupied by China, but claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam; in 2003,
  China and Taiwan asserted claims to the Japanese-administered
  Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Tai) with increased media coverage and
  protest actions

Tajikistan
  prolonged regional drought created water-sharing
  difficulties for Amu Darya river states; boundary agreements signed
  in 2002 cede 1,000 sq km of Pamir Mountain range to China in return
  for China relinquishing claims to 28,000 sq km of Tajikistani lands
  but demarcation has not yet commenced; talks continue with
  Uzbekistan to delimit border and remove minefields; disputes in
  Isfara Valley delay delimitation with Kyrgyzstan

Tanzania
  disputes with Malawi over the boundary in Lake Nyasa (Lake
  Malawi) and the meandering Songwe River remain dormant

Thailand
  a 1 kilometer segment at the mouth of the Golok River
  remains in dispute with Malaysia; demarcation with Laos complete
  except for certain Mekong River islets and complaints of Thai
  squatters; despite continuing border committee talks, significant
  differences remain with Burma over boundary alignment and the
  handling of ethnic rebels, refugees, and illegal cross-border
  activities; Cambodia accuses Thailand of moving boundary markers and
  obstructing access to Preah Vihear temple ruins awarded to Cambodia
  by ICJ decision in 1962; 2003 anti-Thai riots in Phnom Penh resulted
  in the destruction of the Thai Embassy and damage to 17 Thai-owned
  businesses and disputes over payments of full compensation persist;
  groups in Burma and Thailand express concern over China's
  construction of 13 hydroelectric dams on the Salween River in Yunnan
  Province

  in 2001 Benin claimed Togo moved boundary monuments - joint
  commission continues to resurvey the boundary

Tokelau
  none

Tonga

Turkey
  complex maritime, air, and territorial disputes with Greece
  in the Aegean Sea; Cyprus question remains with Greece; Syria and
  Iraq protest Turkish hydrological projects to control upper
  Euphrates waters; Turkey has expressed concern over the status of
  Kurds in Iraq; border with Armenia remains closed over
  Nagorno-Karabakh

Turkmenistan
  prolonged regional drought created water-sharing
  difficulties for Amu Darya river states; Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
  reached an agreement on improving water usage along the Amu Darya in
  2004; delimitation of Caspian seabed remains unresolved

Turks and Caicos Islands
  have received Haitians fleeing economic
  collapse and civil unrest

Tuvalu
  none

Uganda
  Tutsi, Hutu, Lendu, Hema, and other ethnic groups, associated
  political rebels, armed gangs, militias, and various government
  forces continue fighting in the Great Lakes region, transcending the
  boundaries of Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and
  Uganda to gain control over populated areas and natural resources;
  government heads pledge to end conflict, but localized violence
  continues despite UN peacekeeping efforts; civil conflict in Sudan
  has extended Sudanese rebel forces and refugees into Uganda and
  given shelter to Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army soldiers in Sudan;
  Kenya and Uganda are working together to stem cattle rustling and
  violence by Lord's Resistance Army along the border

Ukraine
  1997 boundary treaty with Belarus remains unratified due to
  unresolved financial claims, preventing demarcation and reducing
  border security; delimitation of land boundary with Russia is
  complete but boundary through the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait
  remains unresolved despite a December 2003 framework agreement and
  on-going expert-level discussions; Ukraine protests Russia's
  construction of a causeway in the direction of
  Ukrainian-administered Tuzla Island in the Kerch Strait;
  difficulties with Moldova's Transnistria region complicate
  controlling border crossing and customs regimes despite concordance
  on the 2003 delimitation and customs protocols and OSCE assistance;
  has not resolved Romanian claims to Ukrainian-administered Zmiyinyy
  (Snake) Island and Black Sea maritime boundary despite ongoing talks
  based on 1997 friendship treaty to find a solution in two years;
  ongoing dispute between Ukraine and Romania over the Danube River
  delta

United Arab Emirates
  because the treaties have not been made public,
  the exact alignment of the boundary with Saudi Arabia is still
  unknown and labeled approximate; boundary agreement signed and
  ratified with Oman in 2003 for entire border, including Oman's
  Musandam Peninsula and Al Madhah enclaves; UAE engage in direct
  talks and solicit Arab League support to resolve disputes over
  Iran's occupation of Lesser and Greater Tunb Islands and Abu Musa
  Island

United Kingdom
  since Gibraltar residents voted overwhelmingly by
  referendum in 2003 against a "total shared sovereignty" arrangement,
  talks between the UK and Spain over the fate of the 300-year old UK
  colony have stalled; Spain disapproves of UK plans to grant
  Gibraltar greater autonomy; Mauritius and Seychelles claim the
  Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory), and its former
  inhabitants since their eviction in 1965; most reside chiefly in
  Mauritius, and in 2001 were granted UK citizenship and the right to
  repatriation; UK continues to reject sovereignty talks requested by
  Argentina, which still claims the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
  and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; Rockall
  continental shelf dispute involving Denmark and Iceland remains
  dormant; territorial claim in Antarctica (British Antarctic
  Territory) overlaps Argentine claim and partially overlaps Chilean
  claim; disputes with Iceland, Denmark, and Ireland over the Faroe
  Islands continental shelf boundary outside 200 nm

United States
  Prolonged drought, population growth, and outmoded
  practices and infrastructure in the border region has strained
  water-sharing arrangements with Mexico; undocumented nationals from
  Mexico and Central America continue to enter the United States
  illegally; 1990 Maritime Boundary Agreement in the Bering Sea still
  awaits Russian Duma ratification; managed maritime boundary disputes
  with Canada at Dixon Entrance, Beaufort Sea, Strait of Juan de Fuca,
  and around the disputed Machias Seal Island and North Rock; The
  Bahamas have not been able to agree on a maritime boundary; US Naval
  Base at Guantanamo Bay is leased from Cuba and only mutual agreement

  recognize the claims of any other state; Marshall Islands claims
  Wake Island

Uruguay
  uncontested dispute with Brazil over certain islands in the
  Quarai/Cuareim and Invernada streams and the resulting tripoint with
  Argentina

Uzbekistan

  elsewhere continue to mar progress for some 130 km of border; talks
  continue with Tajikistan to determine and delimit border

Vanuatu
  Matthew and Hunter Islands east of New Caledonia claimed by
  Vanuatu and France

Venezuela

  preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary; Guyana has
  expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before
  UNCLOS that the Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with
  Venezuela extends into their waters; maritime boundary dispute with

  protest Venezuela's claim that Aves Island sustains human habitation
  and other states' recognition of it

Vietnam
  demarcation of the land boundary with China continues, but
  maritime boundary and joint fishing zone agreement remains
  unimplemented; Cambodia and Laos protest Vietnamese squatters and
  armed encroachments along border; China occupies Paracel Islands
  also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; involved in complex dispute with
  China, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, and possibly Brunei over the
  Spratly Islands; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in
  the South China Sea" has eased tensions but falls short of a legally
  binding "code of conduct" desired by several of the disputants

Virgin Islands
  none

Wake Island
  claimed by Marshall Islands

Wallis and Futuna
  none

West Bank
  West Bank and Gaza Strip are Israeli-occupied with current
  status subject to the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement -
  permanent status to be determined through further negotiation

Western Sahara
  Morocco claims and administers Western Sahara, whose
  sovereignty remains unresolved - UN-administered cease-fire has
  remained in effect since September 1991 but attempts to hold a
  referendum have failed and parties thus far have rejected all
  brokered proposals

World
  stretching over 250,000 km, the world's 325 international land
  boundaries separate the 192 independent states and 72 dependencies,
  areas of special sovereignty, and other miscellaneous entities;
  ethnicity, culture, race, religion, and language have divided states
  into separate political entities as much as history, physical
  terrain, political fiat, or conquest, resulting in sometimes
  arbitrary and imposed boundaries; maritime states have claimed
  limits and have so far established over 130 maritime boundaries and
  joint development zones to allocate ocean resources and to provide
  for national security at sea; boundary, borderland/resource, and
  territorial disputes vary in intensity from managed or dormant to
  violent or militarized; most disputes over the alignment of
  political boundaries are confined to short segments and are today
  less common and less hostile than borderland, resource, and
  territorial disputes; undemarcated, indefinite, porous, and
  unmanaged boundaries, however, encourage illegal cross-border
  activities, uncontrolled migration, and confrontation; territorial
  disputes may evolve from historical and/or cultural claims, or they
  may be brought on by resource competition; ethnic clashes continue
  to be responsible for much of the territorial fragmentation around
  the world; disputes over islands at sea or in rivers frequently form
  the source of territorial and boundary conflict; other sources of
  contention include access to water and mineral (especially
  petroleum) resources, fisheries, and arable land; nonetheless, most
  nations cooperate to clarify their international boundaries and to
  resolve territorial and resource disputes peacefully; regional
  discord directly affects the sustenance and welfare of local
  populations, often leaving the world community to cope with
  resultant refugees, hunger, disease, impoverishment, deforestation,
  and desertification

Yemen
  Yemen protests Eritrea fishing around the Hanish Islands
  awarded to Yemen by the ICJ in 1999; nomadic groups in border region
  with Saudi Arabia resist demarcation of boundary in accordance wih
