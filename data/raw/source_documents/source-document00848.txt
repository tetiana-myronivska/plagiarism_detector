Appendix D - Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes


FIPS 10-4: Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and
Their Principal Administrative Divisions (FIPS PUB 10-4) is maintained
by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues (Department of State)
and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(Department of Commerce). FIPS 10-4 codes are intended for general use
throughout the US Government, especially in activities associated with
the mission of the Department of State and national defense programs.

ISO 3166: Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries (ISO 3166)
is prepared by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO
3166 includes two- and three-character alphabetic codes and three-digit
numeric codes that may be needed for activities involving exchange of
data with international organizations that have adopted that standard.
Except for the numeric codes, ISO 3166 codes have been adopted in the
US as FIPS 104-1: American National Standard Codes for the
Representation of Names of Countries, Dependencies, and Areas of
Special Sovereignty for Information Interchange.

Internet:  The Internet country code is the two-letter digraph
maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
in the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).

The US Government has not yet adopted a standard for hydrographic codes
similar to the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 10-4
country codes. The names and limits of the following oceans and seas
are not always directly comparable because of differences in the
customers, needs, and requirements of the individual organizations.
Even the number of principal water bodies varies from organization to
organization. Factbook users, for example, find the Atlantic Ocean and
Pacific Ocean entries useful, but none of the following standards
include those oceans in their entirety. Nor is there any provision for
combining codes or overcodes to aggregate water bodies. The recently
delimited Southern Ocean is not included.
