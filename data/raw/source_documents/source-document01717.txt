Corrections made to printed original.

page 300, "The duad represented the line" - original reads 'decad', making
no sense in view of what follows. Duad (more likely to be misread than
dyad) seems correct.

page 302, "there is a striking story" - original reads 'strlking'.

page 304, "a letter from Eustace Chapuys" - original reads 'Chaupys'.
