Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Indonesia is a source, transit, and destination
  country for women, children and men trafficked for the purposes of
  sexual exploitation and forced labor; Indonesian victims are
  trafficked to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Hong Kong,
  Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore; a significant number of
  Indonesian women who go overseas each year to work as domestic
  servants or "cultural performers" are subjected to conditions of
  involuntary servitude and commercial sexual exploitation; to a
  minimal extent, Indonesia is a destination for women from East Asia,
  Europe, and South America who are trafficked for sexual
  exploitation; there is extensive trafficking within Indonesia from
  rural to urban metropolitan areas particularly for sexual
  exploitation and involuntary domestic servitude
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Indonesia is placed on the Tier 2
  Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
  to combat trafficking

Illicit drugs:

Introduction Iran


Background:
  Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979
  after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and the shah was forced
  into exile. Conservative clerical forces established a theocratic
  system of government with ultimate political authority nominally
  vested in a learned religious scholar. Iranian-US relations have
  been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US
  Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January
  1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq
  that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes
  between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987-1988. Iran
  has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities
  in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject to US
  economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued
  involvement. Following the elections of a reformist president and
  Majlis in the late 1990s, attempts to foster political reform in
  response to popular dissatisfaction floundered as conservative
  politicians prevented reform measures from being enacted, increased
  repressive measures, and made electoral gains against reformers.
  Parliamentary elections in 2004 and the August 2005 inauguration of
  a conservative stalwart as president, completed the reconsolidation
  of conservative power in Iran's government.

Suffrage:
  15 years of age; universal

Executive branch:
  chief of state: Supreme Leader Ali Hoseini-KHAMENEI (since 4 June
  1989)
  head of government: President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD (since 3 August
  2005); First Vice President Parviz DAVUDI (since 11 September 2005)
  cabinet: Council of Ministers selected by the president with
  legislative approval; the Supreme Leader has some control over
  appointments to the more sensitive ministries
  note: also considered part of the Executive branch of government are
  three oversight bodies: 1) Assembly of Experts, a popularly elected
  body of 86 religious scholars constitutionally charged with
  determining the succession of the Supreme Leader, reviewing his
  performance, and deposing him if deemed necessary; 2) Expediency
  Council or Council for the Discernment of Expediency is a policy
  advisory and implementation board consisting of permanent and
  temporary members representing all major government factions, some
  of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader; the Council exerts
  supervisory authority over the executive, judicial, and legislative
  branches and resolves legislative issues on which the Majles and the
  Council of Guardians disagree; 3) Council of Guardians or Council of
  Guardians of the Constitution is a 12-member board of clerics and

  legislation is both constitutional and faithful to Islamic law; the
  Council also vets candidates for suitability and supervises national
  elections
  elections: Supreme Leader appointed for life by the Assembly of
  Experts; president elected by popular vote for a four-year term

  religious minorities 5, and 2 seats unaccounted for

Judicial branch:
  Supreme Court - above a special clerical court, a revolutionary
  court, and a special administrative court

Political parties and leaders:
  formal political parties are a relatively new phenomenon in Iran
  and most conservatives still prefer to work through political
  pressure groups rather than parties; a loose pro-reform coalition
  called the 2nd Khordad Front, which includes political parties as
  well as less formal pressure groups and organizations, achieved
  considerable success at elections to the sixth Majles in early 2000;
  groups in the coalition include: Islamic Iran Participation Front
  (IIPF), Executives of Construction Party (Kargozaran), Solidarity
  Party, Islamic Labor Party, Mardom Salari, Mojahedin of the Islamic
  Revolution Organization (MIRO), and Militant Clerics Society
  (Ruhaniyun); the coalition participated in the seventh Majles
  elections in early 2004; following his defeat in the 2005
  presidential elections, former MCS Secretary General Mehdi KARRUBI
  formed the National Trust Party; a new apparently conservative
  group, the Builders of Islamic Iran, took a leading position in the
  new Majles after winning a majority of the seats in February 2004

Political pressure groups and leaders:
  political pressure groups conduct most of Iran's political
  activities; groups that generally support the Islamic Republic
  include Ansar-e Hizballah, Muslim Students Following the Line of the
  Imam, Tehran Militant Clergy Association (Ruhaniyat), Islamic
  Coalition Party (Motalefeh), and Islamic Engineers Society; active
  pro-reform student groups include the Office of Strengthening Unity
  (OSU); opposition groups include Freedom Movement of Iran, the
  National Front, Marz-e Por Gohar, and various ethnic and Monarchist
  organizations; armed political groups that have been almost
  completely repressed by the government include Mujahidin-e Khalq
  Organization (MEK), People's Fedayeen, Democratic Party of Iranian
  Kurdistan, and Komala

Economy Iran


Economy - overview:
  Iran's economy is marked by a bloated, inefficient state sector,
  over reliance on the oil sector, and statist policies that create
  major distortions throughout. Most economic activity is controlled
  by the state. Private sector activity is typically small-scale -
  workshops, farming, and services. President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD has
  continued to follow the market reform plans of former President
  RAFSANJANI, with limited progress. Relatively high oil prices in
  recent years have enabled Iran to amass some $40 billion in foreign
  exchange reserves, but have not eased economic hardships such as
  high unemployment and inflation. The proportion of the economy
  devoted to the development of weapons of mass destruction remains a
  contentious issue with leading Western nations.

  Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are trafficked through Iran en
  route to Persian Gulf states where they are ultimately forced to
  work as camel jockeys, beggars, or laborers; Afghan women and girls
  are trafficked to the country for forced marriages and sexual
  exploitation; women and children are also trafficked internally for
  the purposes of forced marriage, sexual exploitation, and
  involuntary servitude
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Iran is downgraded to Tier 3 after persistent,
  credible reports of Iranian authorities punishing victims of
  trafficking with beatings, imprisonment, and execution

Illicit drugs:
  despite substantial interdiction efforts, Iran remains a key
  transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe; domestic
  narcotics consumption remains a persistent problem and according to
  official Iranian statistics there are at least 2 million drug users
  in the country; lacks anti-money-laundering laws

@Iraq

Introduction Iraq


Background:
  Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by Britain
  during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a League
  of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over the next
  dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A
  "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of
  military strongmen ruled the country, the latest was SADDAM Husayn.
  Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly
  eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait, but
  was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of
  January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN
  Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass
  destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification
  inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions
  over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in
  March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. Coalition
  forces remain in Iraq, helping to restore degraded infrastructure
  and facilitating the establishment of a freely elected government,
  while simultaneously dealing with a robust insurgency. The Coalition
  Provisional Authority, which temporarily administered Iraq after the
  invasion, transferred full governmental authority on 28 June 2004,
  to the Iraqi Interim Government (IG), which governed under the
  Transitional Administrative Law for Iraq (TAL). Under the TAL,
  elections for a 275-member Transitional National Assembly (TNA) were
  held in Iraq on 30 January 2005. Following these elections, the
  Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) assumed office. The TNA was
  charged with drafting Iraq's permanent constitution, which was
  approved in a 15 October 2005 constitutional referendum. An election
  under the constitution for a 275-member Council of Representatives
  (CoR) was held in December 2005. The CoR approval in the selection
  of most of the cabinet ministers on 20 May 2006 marked the
  transition from the ITG to Iraq's full-term government.

Economy Iraq


Economy - overview:
  Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which has
  traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings.
  Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international
  economic sanctions, and damage from military action by an
  international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
  reduced economic activity. Although government policies supporting
  large military and internal security forces and allocating resources
  to key supporters of the regime hurt the economy, implementation of
  the UN's oil-for-food program, which began in December 1996, helped
  improve conditions for the average Iraqi citizen. Iraq was allowed
  to export limited amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and
  some infrastructure spare parts. In December 1999, the UN Security
  Council authorized Iraq to export under the program as much oil as
  required to meet humanitarian needs. Per capita food imports
  increased significantly, while medical supplies and health care
  services steadily improved. Per capita output and living standards
  were still well below the pre-1991 level, but any estimates have a
  wide range of error. The military victory of the US-led coalition in
  March-April 2003 resulted in the shutdown of much of the central
  economic administrative structure. Although a comparatively small
  amount of capital plant was damaged during the hostilities, looting,
  insurgent attacks, and sabotage have undermined efforts to rebuild
  the economy. Attacks on key economic facilities - especially oil
  pipelines and infrastructure - have prevented Iraq from reaching
  projected export volumes, but total government revenues have been
  higher than anticipated due to high oil prices. Despite political
  uncertainty, Iraq has established the institutions needed to
  implement economic policy, has successfully concluded a three-stage
  debt reduction agreement with the Paris Club, and is working toward
  a Standby Arrangement with the IMF. The Standby Arrangement would
  clear the way for continued debt relief from the Paris Club.

Introduction Ireland


Background:
  Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600-150 B.C. Invasions
  by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were finally ended
  when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014. English invasions
  began in the 12th century and set off more than seven centuries of
  Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions and harsh
  repressions. A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off
  several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in
  independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern
  (Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1948 Ireland withdrew
  from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in
  1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of
  Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A
  peace settlement for Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday
  Agreement and approved in 1998, is being implemented with some
  difficulties.

Economy Ireland


Economy - overview:
  Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent economy with growth
  averaging a robust 7% in 1995-2004. Agriculture, once the most
  important sector, is now dwarfed by industry and services. Industry
  accounts for 46% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and 29% of the labor
  force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's
  growth, the economy has also benefited from a rise in consumer
  spending, construction, and business investment. Per capita GDP is
  10% above that of the four big European economies and the second
  highest in the EU behind Luxembourg. Over the past decade, the Irish
  Government has implemented a series of national economic programs
  designed to curb price and wage inflation, reduce government
  spending, increase labor force skills, and promote foreign
  investment. Ireland joined in circulating the euro on 1 January 2002
  along with 11 other EU nations.

Economy Isle of Man


Economy - overview:
  Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the
  economy. The government offers incentives to high-technology
  companies and financial institutions to locate on the island; this
  has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in high-income
  industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays
  of the economy, have declined in their shares of GDP. Trade is
  mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU markets.

Introduction Israel


Background:
  Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of
  Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish
  states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the
  Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the
  deep tensions between the two sides. The territories occupied by
  Israel since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country
  profile, unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew
  from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty.
  Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September 1993 a
  Declaration of Principles (also known as the "Oslo Accords") guiding
  an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding territorial
  and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994
  Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May 2000, Israel
  withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied
  since 1982. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid
  Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted
  between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve
  a permanent settlement. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working in
  conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the "Quartet" - took the
  lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict
  by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two
  states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However, progress toward
  a permanent status agreement was undermined by Palestinian-Israeli
  violence between September 2000 and February 2005. An agreement
  reached at Sharm al-Sheikh in February 2005 significantly reduced
  the violence. The election in January 2005 of Mahmud ABBAS as the
  new Palestinian leader following the November 2004 death of Yasir
  ARAFAT, the formation of a Likud-Labor-United Torah Judaism
  coalition government in January 2005, and the successful Israeli
  disengagement from the Gaza Strip (August-September 2005), presented
  an opportunity for a renewed peace effort. However, internal Israeli
  political events between October and December 2005 have destabilized
  the political situation and forced early elections, scheduled for
  March 2006.

Economy Israel


Economy - overview:
  Israel has a technologically advanced market economy with
  substantial government participation. It depends on imports of crude
  oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite limited
  natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural
  and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel imports
  substantial quantities of grain, but is largely self-sufficient in
  other agricultural products. Cut diamonds, high-technology
  equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are the
  leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable current account
  deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad
  and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt
  is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic and
  military aid. The bitter Israeli-Palestinian conflict; difficulties
  in the high-technology, construction, and tourist sectors; and
  fiscal austerity in the face of growing inflation led to small
  declines in GDP in 2001 and 2002. The economy rebounded in 2003 and
  2004, growing at a 4% rate each year, as the government tightened
  fiscal policy and implemented structural reforms to boost
  competition and efficiency in the markets. In 2005, rising consumer
  confidence, tourism, and foreign direct investment - as well as
  higher demand for Israeli exports - boosted GDP by 4.7%.

  its settlers and military from the Gaza Strip and from four
  settlements in the West Bank in August 2005; Golan Heights is
  Israeli-occupied (Lebanon claims the Shab'a Farms area of Golan
  Heights); since 1948, about 350 peacekeepers from the UN Truce
  Supervision Organization (UNTSO) headquartered in Jerusalem monitor
  ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements, prevent isolated

  region

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  IDPs: 276,000 (Arab villagers displaced from homes in northern
  Israel) (2005)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Israel is a destination country for low-skilled
  workers from Eastern Europe and Asia who migrate voluntarily for
  contract labor in the construction, agriculture, and health care
  industries, some of whom are subsequently subjected to conditions of
  involuntary servitude; many labor recruitment agencies in source
  countries and in Israel require workers to pay large up-front fees
  that often lead to debt bondage and vulnerability to forced labor;
  Israel is also a destination country for women trafficked from
  Eastern Europe for the purpose of sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Israel is placed on the Tier 2
  Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
  to address trafficking, namely the conditions of involuntary
  servitude allegedly facing thousands of foreign migrant workers

Illicit drugs:
  increasingly concerned about cocaine and heroin abuse; drugs arrive
  in country from Lebanon and, increasingly, from Jordan;
  money-laundering center

Introduction Italy


Background:
  Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the
  peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King
  Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a
  close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist
  dictatorship. His disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany led to
  Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the
  monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter
  member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has
  been at the forefront of European economic and political
  unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.
  Persistent problems include illegal immigration, organized crime,
  corruption, high unemployment, sluggish economic growth, and the low
  incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the
  prosperous north.

Economy Italy


Economy - overview:
  Italy has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same
  total and per capita output as France and the UK. This capitalistic
  economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated
  by private companies, and a less-developed, welfare-dependent,
  agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed
  by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported.
  Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in
  order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions
  and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates. The
  current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at
  improving competitiveness and long-term growth. Italy has moved
  slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as
  lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labor
  market and over-generous pension system, because of the current
  economic slowdown and opposition from labor unions. But the
  leadership faces a severe economic constraint: the budget deficit
  has breached the 3% EU ceiling. The economy experienced almost no
  growth in 2005, and unemployment remained at a high level.

Introduction Jamaica


Background:
  The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was
  settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino
  Indians, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually
  exterminated, replaced by African slaves. England siezed the island
  in 1655 and a plantation economy - based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee
  - was established. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter
  million slaves, many of which became small farmers. Jamaica
  gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain, and in 1958
  it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation
  of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it
  withdrew from the federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic
  conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs
  created by the major political parties evolved into powerful
  organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling
  and money laundering. The cycle of violence, drugs, and poverty has
  served to impoverish large sectors of the populace. Nonetheless,
  many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute
  substantially to the economy.

Economy Jamaica


Economy - overview:
  The Jamaican economy is heavily dependent on services, which now
  account for 60% of GDP. The country continues to derive most of its
  foreign exchange from remittances, tourism, and bauxite/alumina. The
  global economic slowdown, particularly after the terrorist attacks
  in the US on 11 September 2001, stunted economic growth; the economy
  rebounded moderately in 2003-04, with brisk tourist seasons. But the
  economy faces serious long-term problems: high interest rates,
  increased foreign competition, exchange rate instability, a sizable
  merchandise trade deficit, large-scale unemployment and
  underemployment, and a growing stock of internal debt - the result
  of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy, most
  notably the financial sector in the mid-1990s. The ratio of debt to
  GDP is 135%. Inflation, previously a bright spot, is expected to
  remain in the double digits. Uncertain economic conditions have led
  to increased civil unrest, including gang violence fueled by the
  drug trade. In 2004, the government faced the difficult prospect of
  having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt
  payments while simultaneously attacking a serious and growing crime
  problem that is hampering economic growth. Attempts at deficit
  control were derailed by Hurricane Ivan in September 2004, which
  required substantial government spending to repair the damage.
  Despite the hurricane, tourism looks set to enjoy solid growth for
  the foreseeable future.

@Japan

Introduction Japan


Background:
  In 1603, a Tokugawa shogunate (military dictatorship) ushered in a
  long period of isolation from foreign influence in order to secure
  its power. For 250 years this policy enabled Japan to enjoy
  stability and a flowering of its indigenous culture. Following the
  Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854, Japan opened its ports and
  began to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late
  19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that
  was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied
  Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32
  Japan occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale
  invasion of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering
  America's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East
  and Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan
  recovered to become an economic power and a staunch ally of the US.
  While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity,
  actual power rests in networks of powerful politicians, bureaucrats,
  and business executives. The economy experienced a major slowdown
  starting in the 1990s following three decades of unprecedented
  growth, but Japan still remains a major economic power, both in Asia
  and globally. In 2005, Japan began a two-year term as a
  non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.

Economy Japan


Economy - overview:
  Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of
  high technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation (1% of
  GDP) helped Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of
  second most technologically powerful economy in the world after the
  US and the third-largest economy in the world after the US and
  China, measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. One
  notable characteristic of the economy is how manufacturers,
  suppliers, and distributors work together in closely-knit groups
  called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee of
  lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor
  force. Both features are now eroding. Japan's industrial sector is
  heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. The tiny
  agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop
  yields among the highest in the world. Usually self sufficient in
  rice, Japan must import about 60% of its food on a caloric basis.
  Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and
  accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. For three decades,
  overall real economic growth had been spectacular - a 10% average in
  the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s.
  Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely
  because of the after effects of overinvestment during the late 1980s
  and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring speculative
  excesses from the stock and real estate markets and to force a
  restructuring of the economy. From 2000 to 2003, government efforts
  to revive economic growth met with little success and were further
  hampered by the slowing of the US, European, and Asian economies. In
  2004 and 2005, growth improved and the lingering fears of deflation
  in prices and economic activity lessened. Japan's huge government
  debt, which totals 170% of GDP, and the aging of the population are
  two major long-run problems. Some fear that a rise in taxes could
  endanger the current economic recovery. Internal conflict over the
  proper way to reform the financial system will continue as Japan
  Post's banking, insurance, and delivery services undergo
  privatization between 2007 and 2017.

Economy Jersey


Economy - overview:
  Jersey's economy is based on international financial services,
  agriculture, and tourism. In 1996, the finance sector accounted for
  about 60% of the island's output. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes,
  and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to
  the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and
  represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to
  the UK and other EU countries. Tourism accounts for 24% of GDP. In
  recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate
  in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has
  developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All
  raw material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a
  large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties
  make the island a popular tax haven. Living standards come close to
  those of the UK.

@Jordan

Introduction Jordan


Background:
  Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire,
  the UK received a mandate to govern much of the Middle East. Britain
  separated out a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from Palestine
  in the early 1920s, and the area gained its independence in 1946; it
  adopted the name of Jordan in 1950. The country's long-time ruler
  was King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic leader, he successfully
  navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and
  UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian
  population, despite several wars and coup attempts. In 1989 he
  reinstituted parliamentary elections and gradual political
  liberalization; in 1994 he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King
  ABDALLAH II, the son of King HUSSEIN, assumed the throne following
  his father's death in February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated
  his power and undertaken an aggressive economic reform program.
  Jordan acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000, and began to
  participate in the European Free Trade Association in 2001. After a
  two-year delay, parliamentary and municipal elections took place in
  the summer of 2003. The prime minister appointed in November 2005
  stated the government would focus on political reforms, improving
  conditions for the poor, and fighting corruption.

Economy Jordan


Economy - overview:
  Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate supplies of water
  and other natural resources such as oil. Debt, poverty, and
  unemployment are fundamental problems, but King ABDALLAH, since
  assuming the throne in 1999, has undertaken some broad economic
  reforms in a long-term effort to improve living standards. 'Amman in
  the past three years has worked closely with the IMF, practiced
  careful monetary policy, and made substantial headway with
  privatization. The government also has liberalized the trade regime
  sufficiently to secure Jordan's membership in the WTO (2000), a free
  trade accord with the US (2001), and an association agreement with
  the EU (2001). These measures have helped improve productivity and
  have put Jordan on the foreign investment map. Jordan imported most
  of its oil from Iraq, but the US-led war in Iraq in 2003 made Jordan
  more dependent on oil from other Gulf nations, forcing the Jordanian
  Government to raise retail petroleum product prices and the sales
  tax base. Jordan's export market, which is heavily dependent on
  exports to Iraq, was also affected by the war but recovered quickly
  while contributing to the Iraq recovery effort. The main challenges
  facing Jordan are reducing dependence on foreign grants, reducing
  the budget deficit, and creating investment incentives to promote
  job creation.

Introduction Kazakhstan


Background:
  Native Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes who
  migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united as
  a single nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th
  century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the
  1950s and 1960s agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens
  were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures.
  This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other
  deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled
  non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 caused many
  of these newcomers to emigrate. Current issues include: developing a
  cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the
  country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;
  achieving a sustainable economic growth outside the oil, gas, and
  mining sectors; and strengthening relations with neighboring states
  and other foreign powers.

Geography Kazakhstan


Location:
  Central Asia, northwest of China; a small portion west of the Ural
  River in eastern-most Europe

Geographic coordinates:
  48 00 N, 68 00 E

Map references:

Area:
  total: 2,717,300 sq km
  land: 2,669,800 sq km
  water: 47,500 sq km

Area - comparative:
  slightly less than four times the size of Texas

Land boundaries:
  total: 12,012 km
  border countries: China 1,533 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,051 km, Russia 6,846
  km, Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan 2,203 km

Coastline:
  0 km (landlocked); note - Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea, now
  split into two bodies of water (1,070 km), and the Caspian Sea
  (1,894 km)

Maritime claims:
  none (landlocked)

Climate:
  continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid

Terrain:
  extends from the Volga to the Altai Mountains and from the plains
  in western Siberia to oases and desert in Central Asia

Elevation extremes:
  lowest point: Vpadina Kaundy -132 m
  highest point: Khan Tangiri Shyngy (Pik Khan-Tengri) 6,995 m

Natural resources:
  major deposits of petroleum, natural gas, coal, iron ore,
  manganese, chrome ore, nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, lead,
  zinc, bauxite, gold, uranium

Land use:

  permanent crops: 0.05%
  other: 91.67% (2005)

Irrigated land:
  35,560 sq km (2003)

Natural hazards:
  earthquakes in the south, mudslides around Almaty

Environment - current issues:
  radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with former defense
  industries and test ranges scattered throughout the country pose
  health risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe
  in some cities; because the two main rivers which flowed into the
  Aral Sea have been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and
  leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides and natural
  salts; these substances are then picked up by the wind and blown
  into noxious dust storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil
  pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals and salination from
  poor infrastructure and wasteful irrigation practices

Environment - international agreements:
  party to: Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change,
  Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer
  Protection, Ship Pollution
  signed, but not ratified: Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol

Geography - note:
  landlocked; Russia leases approximately 6,000 sq km of territory
  enclosing the Baykonur Cosmodrome; in January 2004, Kazakhstan and
  Russia extended the lease to 2050

Economy Kazakhstan


Economy - overview:
  Kazakhstan, the largest of the former Soviet republics in
  territory, excluding Russia, possesses enormous fossil fuel reserves
  and plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals. It also has a
  large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain.
  Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and
  processing of these natural resources and also on a growing
  machine-building sector specializing in construction equipment,
  tractors, agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The
  breakup of the USSR in December 1991 and the collapse in demand for
  Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products resulted in a
  short-term contraction of the economy, with the steepest annual
  decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97, the pace of the government
  program of economic reform and privatization quickened, resulting in
  a substantial shifting of assets into the private sector. Kazakhstan
  enjoyed double-digit growth in 2000-01 - 9% or more per year in
  2002-05 - thanks largely to its booming energy sector, but also to
  economic reform, good harvests, and foreign investment. The opening
  of the Caspian Consortium pipeline in 2001, from western
  Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield to the Black Sea, substantially raised
  export capacity. Kazakhstan also has begun work on an ambitious
  cooperative construction effort with China to build an oil pipeline
  that will extend from the country's Caspian coast eastward to the
  Chinese border. The country has embarked upon an industrial policy
  designed to diversify the economy away from overdependence on the
  oil sector by developing light industry. The policy aims to reduce
  the influence of foreign investment and foreign personnel. The
  government has engaged in several disputes with foreign oil
  companies over the terms of production agreements; tensions
  continue. Upward pressure on the local currency continued in 2005
  due to massive oil-related foreign-exchange inflows.

Introduction Kenya


Background:
  Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led
  Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when
  President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional
  succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969
  until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made
  itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and
  external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The
  ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power
  in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and
  fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the
  Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following
  fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate
  of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow
  Coalition, defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the
  presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption
  platform.

Economy Kenya


Economy - overview:
  The regional hub for trade and finance in East Africa, Kenya has
  been hampered by corruption and by reliance upon several primary
  goods whose prices have remained low. In 1997, the IMF suspended
  Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the
  government's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption. A
  severe drought from 1999 to 2000 compounded Kenya's problems,
  causing water and energy rationing and reducing agricultural output.
  As a result, GDP contracted by 0.2% in 2000. The IMF, which had
  resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through the drought, again
  halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to institute
  several anticorruption measures. Despite the return of strong rains
  in 2001, weak commodity prices, endemic corruption, and low
  investment limited Kenya's economic growth to 1.2%. Growth lagged at
  1.1% in 2002 because of erratic rains, low investor confidence,
  meager donor support, and political infighting up to the elections.
  In the key December 2002 elections, Daniel Arap MOI's 24-year-old
  reign ended, and a new opposition government took on the formidable
  economic problems facing the nation. In 2003, progress was made in
  rooting out corruption and encouraging donor support. GDP grew more
  than 5% in 2005.

  Resistance Army (LRA) rebels; the Kenya-Somalia border is open to
  pastoralists and is susceptible to cross-border clan insurgencies;
  Kenya's administrative limits extend beyond the treaty border into
  the Sudan, creating the Ilemi Triangle

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  refugees (country of origin): 153,627 (Somalia) 12,595 (Ethiopia)
  67,556 (Sudan)
  IDPs: 360,000 (KANU attacks on opposition tribal groups in 1990s)
  (2005)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Kenya is a source, transit, and destination
  country for men, women, and children trafficked for forced labor and
  sexual exploitation; children are trafficked within the country for
  domestic servitude, street vending, agricultural labor, and sexual
  exploitation; men, women, and girls are trafficked to the Middle
  East, other African nations, Western Europe, and North America for
  domestic servitude, enslavement in massage parlors and brothels, and
  manual labor; Chinese women trafficked for sexual exploitation
  reportedly transit Nairobi and Bangladeshis may transit Kenya for
  forced labor in other countries
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Kenya is placed on the Tier 2 Watch
  List due to a lack of evidence of increasing efforts to combat
  severe forms of trafficking

Illicit drugs:
  widespread harvesting of small plots of marijuana; transit country
  for South Asian heroin destined for Europe and North America; Indian
  methaqualone also transits on way to South Africa; significant
  potential for money-laundering activity given the country's status
  as a regional financial center; massive corruption, and relatively
  high levels of narcotics-associated activities

@Kiribati

Introduction Kiribati


Background:
  The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and
  complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati. The US
  relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line
  Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati.

Geography Kiribati


Location:
  Oceania, group of 33 coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean, straddling
  the Equator; the capital Tarawa is about one-half of the way from
  Hawaii to Australia; note - on 1 January 1995, Kiribati proclaimed
  that all of its territory lies in the same time zone as its Gilbert
  Islands group (GMT +12) even though the Phoenix Islands and the Line
  Islands under its jurisdiction lie on the other side of the
  International Date Line

Economy Kiribati


Economy - overview:
  A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has few
  natural resources. Commercially viable phosphate deposits were
  exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and
  fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy
  has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development is
  constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure,
  and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more
  than one-fifth of GDP. The financial sector is at an early stage of
  development as is the expansion of private sector initiatives.
  Foreign financial aid from UK, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and
  China equals about 20% of GDP. Remittances from seamen on merchant
  ships abroad account for more than $5 million each year. Kiribati
  receives around $15 million annually for the government budget from
  an Australian trust fund.

@Korea, North

Introduction Korea, North


Background:
  An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was
  occupied by Japan in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War. Five
  years later, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula. Following
  World War II, Korea was split with the northern half coming under
  Soviet-sponsored Communist domination. After failing in the Korean
  War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea (ROK) in
  the southern portion by force, North Korea (DPRK), under its founder
  President KIM Il-so'ng, adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic
  and economic "self-reliance" as a check against excessive Soviet or
  Communist Chinese influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the
  ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded
  propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military policies
  around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of
  Korea under Pyongyang's control. KIM's son, the current ruler KIM
  Jong Il, was officially designated as his father's successor in
  1980, assuming a growing political and managerial role until the
  elder KIM's death in 1994. After decades of economic mismanagement
  and resource misallocation, the DPRK since the mid-1990s has relied
  heavily on international aid to feed its population while continuing
  to expend resources to maintain an army of 1 million. North Korea's
  long-range missile development, as well as its nuclear, chemical,
  and biological weapons programs and massive conventional armed
  forces, are of major concern to the international community. In
  December 2002, following revelations that the DPRK was pursuing a
  nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium in violation of a
  1994 agreement with the US to freeze and ultimately dismantle its
  existing plutonium-based program, North Korea expelled monitors from
  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In January 2003, it
  declared its withdrawal from the international Non-Proliferation
  Treaty. In mid-2003 Pyongyang announced it had completed the
  reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods (to extract weapons-grade
  plutonium) and was developing a "nuclear deterrent." Since August
  2003, North Korea has participated in the Six-Party Talks with
  China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US designed to resolve
  the stalemate over its nuclear programs. The fourth round of
  Six-Party Talks were held in Beijing during July-September 2005. All
  parties agreed to a Joint Statement of Principles in which, among
  other things, the six parties unanimously reaffirmed the goal of
  verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful
  manner. In the Joint Statement, the DPRK committed to "abandoning
  all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning, at
  an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
  Weapons and to IAEA safeguards." The Joint Statement also commits
  the US and other parties to certain actions as the DPRK
  denuclearizes. The US offered a security assurance, specifying that
  it had no nuclear weapons on ROK territory and no intention to
  attack or invade the DPRK with nuclear or other weapons. The US and
  DPRK will take steps to normalize relations, subject to the DPRK's
  implementing its denuclearization pledge and resolving other
  longstanding concerns. While the Joint Statement provides a vision
  of the end-point of the Six-Party process, much work lies ahead to
  implement the elements of the agreement.

Economy Korea, North


Economy - overview:
  North Korea, one of the world's most centrally planned and isolated
  economies, faces desperate economic conditions. Industrial capital
  stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of
  underinvestment and shortages of spare parts. Industrial and power
  output have declined in parallel. Despite an increased harvest in
  2005 because of more stable weather conditions, fertilizer
  assistance from South Korea, and an extraordinary mobilization of
  the population to help with agricultural production, the nation has
  suffered its 11th year of food shortages because of on-going
  systemic problems, including a lack of arable land, collective
  farming practices, and chronic shortages of tractors and fuel.
  Massive international food aid deliveries have allowed the people of
  North Korea to escape mass starvation since famine threatened in
  1995, but the population continues to suffer from prolonged
  malnutrition and poor living conditions. Large-scale military
  spending eats up resources needed for investment and civilian
  consumption. In 2004, the regime formalized an arrangement whereby
  private "farmers markets" were allowed to begin selling a wider
  range of goods. It also permitted some private farming on an
  experimental basis in an effort to boost agricultural output. In
  October 2005, the regime reversed some of these policies by
  forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting a centralized
  food rationing system. In December 2005, the regime confirmed that
  it intended to carry out earlier threats to terminate all
  international humanitarian assistance operations in the DPRK
  (calling instead for developmental assistance only) and to restrict
  the activities of international and non-governmental aid
  organizations such as the World Food Program. Firm political control
  remains the Communist government's overriding concern, which will
  likely inhibit the loosening of economic regulations.

@Korea, South

Introduction Korea, South


Background:
  Korea was an independent kingdom for much of its millennia-long
  history. Following its victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905,
  Japan occupied Korea; five years later it formally annexed the
  entire peninsula. After World War II, a Republic of Korea (ROK) was
  set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a
  Communist-style government was installed in the north (the DPRK).
  During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and UN forces fought
  alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South Korea from DPRK
  attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An armistice was
  signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a demilitarized zone
  at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South Korea achieved rapid
  economic growth with per capita income rising to roughly 14 times
  the level of North Korea. In 1993, KIM Yo'ng-sam became South
  Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of military
  rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern democracy. In
  June 2000, a historic first North-South summit took place between
  the South's President KIM Dae-jung and the North's leader KIM Jong
  Il.

Economy Korea, South


Economy - overview:
  Since the early 1960s, South Korea has achieved an incredible
  record of growth and integration into the high-tech modern world
  economy. Four decades ago, GDP per capita was comparable with levels
  in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004, South Korea
  joined the trillion dollar club of world economies. Today its GDP
  per capita is equal to the lesser economies of the EU. This success
  through the late 1980s was achieved by a system of close
  government/business ties, including directed credit, import
  restrictions, sponsorship of specific industries, and a strong labor
  effort. The government promoted the import of raw materials and
  technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings
  and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of
  1997-99 exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development
  model, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing,
  and an undisciplined financial sector. GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998,
  then recovered 9.5% in 1999 and 8.5% in 2000. Growth fell back to
  3.3% in 2001 because of the slowing global economy, falling exports,
  and the perception that much-needed corporate and financial reforms
  had stalled. Led by consumer spending and exports, growth in 2002
  was an impressive 7%, despite anemic global growth. Between 2003 and
  2005, growth moderated to about 4%. A downturn in consumer spending
  was offset by rapid export growth. In 2005, the government proposed
  labor reform legislation and a corporate pension scheme to help make
  the labor market more flexible, and new real estate policies to cool
  property speculation. Moderate inflation, low unemployment, an
  export surplus, and fairly equal distribution of income characterize
  this solid economy.

Economy Kuwait


Economy - overview:
  Kuwait is a small, rich, relatively open economy with self-reported
  crude oil reserves of about 96 billion barrels - 10% of world
  reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 95% of export
  revenues, and 80% of government income. Kuwait's climate limits
  agricultural development. Consequently, with the exception of fish,
  it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of potable water
  must be distilled or imported. Kuwait continues its discussions with
  foreign oil companies to develop fields in the northern part of the
  country.

  or low-skilled labor, but are subjected to conditions of involuntary
  servitude by employers in Kuwait including conditions of physical
  and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages, confinement to the home, and
  withholding of passports to restrict their freedom of movement;
  Kuwait is reportedly a transit point for South and East Asian
  workers recruited for low-skilled work in Iraq; some of these
  workers are deceived as to the true location and nature of this
  work, and others are subjected to conditions of involuntary
  servitude in Iraq; in past years, Kuwait was also a destination
  country for children exploited as camel jockeys, but this form of
  trafficking appears to have ceased
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Kuwait is placed on the Tier 2
  Watch List because its efforts are based largely on pledges of
  future actions

Introduction Kyrgyzstan


Background:
  A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud
  nomadic traditions, Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864; it
  achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Nationwide
  demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of
  President Askar AKAYEV, who had run the country since 1990.
  Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won
  overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIYEV. Current
  concerns include: privatization of state-owned enterprises,
  expansion of democracy and political freedoms, reduction of
  corruption, improving interethnic relations, and combating terrorism.
