PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.


In preparing this second edition of my relative's work, I have
incorporated the results of observations made by me during several
years' residence in Somersetshire, in the centre of the district.
I have also availed myself by kind permission, of hints and
suggestions in two papers, entitled "Somersetshire Dialect," read
by T. S. Baynes in 1856, and reprinted from the Taunton Courier,
in London, in 1861.

During the forty years which have elapsed since the first edition,
very much light has been thrown on the subject of Provincial
Dialects, and after all much remains to be discovered. I consider
with Mr. Baynes that there is more of the pure Anglo-Saxon in the
west of England dialect, as this district was the seat of
classical Anglo-Saxon, which first rose here to a national tongue,
and lasted longer in a great measure owing to its distance from
the Metropolis, from which cause also it was less subject to
modern modification.

I shall be happy to receive any suggestions from Philological
scholars, which may increase the light thrown on the subject, and
by which a third edition may be improved.

_Hagbourn Vicarage, August,_ 1869.


PREFACE.


The usefulness of works like the present is too generally admitted
to need any apology for their publication. There is,
notwithstanding, in their very nature a dryness, which requires
relief: the author trusts, therefore, that, in blending something
imaginative with the details of philological precision, his work
will afford amusement to the reader.

The Glossary contains the fruit of years of unwearied attention to
the subject; and it is hoped that the book will be of some use in
elucidating our old writers, in affording occasional help to the
etymology of the Anglo-Saxon portion of our language, and in
exhibiting a view of the present state of an important dialect of
the western provinces of England.

A late excursion through the West has, however, induced the Author
to believe that some valuable information may yet remain to be
gathered from our Anglo-Saxon dialect--more especially from that
part of it still used by the common people and the yeomanry. He
therefore respectfully solicits communications from those who feel
an interest in this department of our literature; by which a
second edition may be materially improved.

To a _native_ of the west of England this volume will be
found a vade-mecum of reference, and assist the reminiscence of
well-known, and too often unnoted peculiarities and words, which
are fast receding from, the polish of elegance, and the refinement
of literature.

In regard to the _Poetical Pieces_, it may be mentioned that
most of them are founded on _West Country Stories_, the
incidents in which actually occurred. If some of the subjects
should be thought trifling, it must not be forgotten that the
primary object has been, to exemplify the Dialect, and that common
subjects offered the best means of effectuating such an object. Of
such Poems as _Good Bwye ta thee Cot_; _the Rookery_;
and _Mary Ramsey's Crutch_, it may be observed, that had the
Author _felt_ less he might, perhaps, have written better.

OBSERVATIONS, &c.


The following Glossary includes the whole of Somerset, _East_
of the River Parret, as well as adjoining parts of Wiltshire and
Gloucestershire. West of the Parret many of the words are
pronounced very differently indeed, so as to mark strongly the
people who use them. [This may be seen more fully developed in two
papers, by T. Spencer Baynes, read before the Somersetshire
Archaeological Society, entitled the Somersetshire Dialect,
printed 1861, 18mo, to whom I here acknowledge my obligations for
several hints and suggestions, of which I avail myself in this
edition of my late relative's work].

The chief peculiarity West of the Parret, is the ending of the
third person singular, present tense of verbs, in _th_ or
_eth_: as, he _lov'th_, _zee'th_, &c., for he
loves, sees, &c.

In the pronouns, they have _Ise_ for _I_, and _er_
for _he_. In fact the peculiarities and contractions of the
Western District are puzzling to a stranger. Thus, _her_ is
frequently used for _she_. "_Har'th a doo'd it_," is,
"_she has done it_," (I shall occasionally in the Glossary
note such words as distinguishingly characterise that district).

Two of the most remarkable peculiarities of the dialect of the
West of England, and particularly of Somersetshire, are the sounds
given to the vowels A and E. A, is almost always sounded open, as
in _fäther_, _räther_, or somewhat like the usual sound
of _a_ in _balloon_, _calico_, lengthened; it is so
pronounced in bäll, cäll. I shall use for this sound the
_circumflex over the a_, thus â_ or ä_. E, has commonly
the same sound as the French gave it, which is, in fact, the
slender of A, as heard in _pane fane_, _cane_, &c. The
hard sound given in our polished dialect to the letters _th_,
in the majority of words containing those letters [as in
_through_, _three_, _thing_, think_], expressed
by the Anglo-Saxon _ð_, is frequently changed in the Western
districts into the sound given in England to the letter _d_:

  as for _three_, we have _dree_

  for _thread_, _dread_, or _dird_,

  _through_, _droo_, _throng_, _drong_, or
rather _drang_;

_thrush_, _dirsh_, &c. The consonant and vowel following
_d_, changing places. The slender or soft sound given to
_th_ in our polished dialect, is in the West, most commonly
converted into the thick or obtuse sound of the same letters as
heard in the words _this_, these &c., and this too, whether
the letters be at the beginning or end of words. I am much
disposed to believe that our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, used
indiscriminately the letters Ð and ð for D only, and sounded them
as such, as we find now frequently in the West; although our
lexicographers usually have given the _two_ sounds of
_th_ to Ð and ð respectively. The vowel O is used for
_a_, as _hond, dorke, lorke, hort,_ in hand, dark, lark,
heart, &c., and other syllables are lengthened, as _voote, bade,
dade,_ for foot, bed, dead. The letter O in _no, gold,_
&c., is sounded like _aw_ in _awful_; I have therefore
spelt it with this diphthong instead of _a_. Such word as
_jay_ for _joy_, and a few others, I have not noted.
Another remarkable fact is the disposition to invert the order of
some consonants in some words; as the _r_ in _thrush,
brush, rush, run,_ &c., pronouncing them dirsh, birsh, hirsh,
hirn; also transposition of _p_ and _s_ in such words as
clasp, hasp, asp, &c., sounded claps, haps, aps, &c. I have not
inserted all these words in the Glossary, as these general remarks
will enable the student to detect the words which are so inverted.
It is by no means improbable that the order in which such sounds
are now repeated in the West, is the original order in which they
existed in our language, and that our more polished mode of
expressing them is a new and perhaps a corrupt enunciation.
Another peculiarity is that of joining the letter _y_ at the
end of some verbs in the infinitive mood, as well as to parts of
different conjugations, thus, "I can't _sewy, nursy, reapy_,
to _sawy_, to _sewy_, to _nursy_, &c. A further
peculiarity is the _love of vowel_ sound, and opening out
monosyllables of our polished dialect into two or more syllables,
thus:

  ay-er, for air;
  boo-äth, for both;
  fay-er, for fair;
  vi-ër for fire;
  stay-ers for stairs;
  show-er for sure;
  vröo-rst for post;
  boo-ath for both;
  bre-ash for brush;
  chee-ase for cheese;
  kee-ard for card;
  gee-ate for gate;
  mee-ade for mead;
  mee-olk for milk; &c.


Chaucer gives many of them as dissyllables.

The verb _to be_ retains much of its primitive form: thus
_I be, thou,_ or _thee, beest,_ or _bist, we be, you
be, they be, thä be_, are continually heard for _I am_,
&c., _he be_ is rarely used: but _he is_. In the past
tense, _war_ is used for _was_, and _were_: _I
war, thou_ or _thee wart_, he _war_, &c., we have
besides, _we'm, you'm, they'm_, for _we, you, they,
are_, there is a constant tendency to pleonasm in some cases,
as well as to contraction, and elision in others. Thus we have
_a lost, agone, abought_, &c., for _lost, gone, bought_,
&c., Chaucer has many of these prefixes; but he often uses
_y_ instead of _a_, as _ylost_. The frequent use of
Z and V, the softened musical sounds for S and F, together with
the frequent increase and multiplication of vowel sounds, give the
dialect a by no means inharmonious expression, certainly it would
not be difficult to select many words which may for their
modulation compete with others of French extraction, and, perhaps
be superior to many others which we have borrowed from other
languages, much less analogous to the polished dialect of our own.
I have added, in pursuance of these ideas, some poetical and prose
pieces in the dialect of Somersetshire, in which the idiom is
tolerably well preserved, and the pronunciation is conveyed in
letters, the nearest to the sound of the words, as there are in
truth many sounds for which we have neither letters, nor
combinations of letters to express them. [I might at some future
period, if thought advisable, go into a comparison between the
sound of all the letters of the alphabet pronounced in
Somersetshire, and in our polished dialect, but I doubt if the
subject is entitled to this degree of criticism]. The reader will
bear in mind that these poems are composed in the dialect of
Somerset, north east of the Parret, which is by far the most
general.

In the Guardian, published about a century ago, is a paper No. 40,
concerning pastoral poetry, supposed to have been written by
_Pope_, to extol his own pastorals and degrade those of
Ambrose Phillips. In this essay there is a quotation from a
pretended _Somersetshire_ poem. But it is evident Pope knew
little or nothing about the Somersetshire dialect. Here are a few
lines from "this old West country bard of ours," as Pope calls
him:

  "_Cicely._ Ah Rager, Rager, cher was zore avraid,
  When in yond vield you kiss'd the parson's maid:
  Is this the love that once to me you zed,
  When from tha wake thou broughtst me gingerbread?"

Now first, this is a strange admixture of dialects, but neither
east, west, north, nor south.

_Chez_ is nowhere used; but in the southern part _utche_
or _iche_, is sometimes spoken contractedly _che_. [See
_utchy_ in the Glossary].

_Vield_ for _field_, should be _veel_.

_Wake_ is not used in Somersetshire; but _revel_ is the
word.

_Parson_, in Somersetshire, dealer, is _pâson_.

In another line he calls the cows, _kee_, which is not
Somersetian; nor is, _be go_ for begone: it should, _be
gwon_; nor is _I've a be_; but _I've a bin_,
Somersetian.

The idiomatic expressions in this dialect are numerous, many will
be found in the Glossary; the following may be mentioned. _I'd
'sley do it_, for _I would as lief do it_. I have
occasionally in the Glossary suggested the etymology of some
words; by far the greater part have an Anglo-Saxon, some perhaps a
Danish origin; [and when we recollect that _Alfred the
Great_, a good Anglo-Saxon scholar, was born at Wantage in
Berks, on the border of Wilts, had a palace at Chippenham, and was
for some time resident in Athelney, we may presume that
traditional remains of him may have influenced the language or
dialect of Somersetshire, and I am inclined to think that the
present language and pronunciation of Somersetshire were some
centuries past, general in the south portion of our island.]

In compiling this Glossary, I give the fruits of twenty-five
years' assiduity, and have defined words, not from books, but from
actual usage; I have however carefully consulted _Junius_,
_Skinner_, _Minshew_, and some other old lexicographers,
and find many of their definitions correspond with my own; but I
avoid _conjectural_ etymology. Few dictionaries of our
language are to be obtained, published from the invention of
printing to the end of the 16th century, a period of about 150
years. They throw much light on our provincial words, yet after
all, our _old writers_ are our chief resource, [and doubtless
many MSS. in various depositories, written at different periods,
and recently brought to light, from the Record and State Paper
Office, and historical societies, will throw much light on the
subject]; and an abundant harvest offers in examining them, by
which to make an amusing book, illustrative of our provincial
words and ancient manners. I think we cannot avoid arriving at the
conclusion, that the Anglo-Saxon dialect, of which I conceive the
Western dialect to be a striking portion, has been gradually
giving way to our polished idiom; and is considered a barbarism,
and yet many of the _sounds_ of that dialect are found in
Holland and Germany, as a part of the living language of these
countries. I am contented with having thus far elucidated the
language of my native county. I have omitted several words, which
I supposed provincial, and which are frequent to the west, as they
are found in the modern dictionaries, still I have allowed a few,
which are in Richardson's Johnson.

_Thee_ is used for the nominative _thou_; which latter
word is seldom used, diphthong sounds used in this dialect are:

  uai, uoa, uoi, uoy, as
  guain, (gwain), quoat, buoil, buoy;

such is the disposition to pleonasm in the use of the
demonstrative pronouns, that they are very often used with the
adverb _there_. _Theäze here, thick there_, [_thicky
there_, west of the Parret] _theäsam_ here, _theazamy
here, them there, themmy there_. The substitution of V for F,
and Z (_Izzard_, _Shard_, for S, is one of the strongest
words of numerous dialects.)

In words ending with _p_ followed by _s_, the letters
change places as:

  hasp--haps;
  clasp--claps,
  wasp--waps;

In a paper by General Vallancey in the second volume of the
_Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_, read Dec. 27,
1788, it appears that a colony of English soldiers settled in the
_Baronies_ of _Forth Bargie_, in the county of Wexford,
in Ireland, in 1167, 1168, and 1169; and that colony preserved
their customs, manners, and language to 1788. There is added in
that paper a _vocabulary_ of their language, and a
_song_, handed down by tradition from the arrival of the
colony more than 600 years since. I think there can be no question
that these Irish colonists were from the West of England, from the
apparent admixture of dialects in the _vocabulary_ and
_song_, although the language is much altered from the Anglo-
Saxon of Somersetshire. [Footnote: This subject has been more
fully treated in the following work: A Glossary, with some pieces
of verse of the old dialect of the English colony in the Baronies
of Forth and Bargy, Co. Wexford, Ireland. Formerly collected by
Jacob Poole, of Growton, now edited with Notes and Introduction by
the Rev. W. Barnes, author of the Dorset Poems and Glossary, fcap.
8vo, 1867.] The words _nouth_, knoweth; _zin_, sin,
_vrast_, frost; _die_, day; _Zathardie_, Saturday;
_Zindii_, Sunday; and a few others, indicate an origin west
of the Parret. There are many words which with a trifling
alteration in spelling, would suit at the present time the north
eastern portion of the county: as _blauther_, bladder:
_crwest_, crust; _smill_, smell; _skir_, to rise in
the air [see _skeer_]; _vier_, fire; _vier_, a
weasel; _zar_, to serve; _zatch_, such, &c. From such
words as _ch'am_, and _ch'uh_, the southern part of the
county is clearly indicated. I think the disposition to elision
and contraction is as evident here as it is at present in
Somersetshire. In the song, there are marks of its having
undergone change since its first introduction.

_Lowthee_ is evidently derived from _lewth_ [see
Glossary] _lewthy_, will be, _abounding in lewth_, i. e.
sheltered.

The line

  "_As by mizluck wus I pit t' drive in._"

would in the present Somerset dialect stand thus:

  "_That by misluck war a put ta dreav in."

  That by mis-luck was placed to drive in.

In the line

  "_Chote well ar aim wai t' yie ouz n'eer a blowe_."

the word _chete_ is, I suspect, compounded of _'ch'_
[_iche_] and _knew_, implying _I knew_, or rather
_I knew'd_, or _knewt_. [Footnote: The following is
from, an amatory poem, written, in or about the reign of Henry
II., during which the colony of the English was established in the
county of Wexford.

  "Ichot from heune it is me sent."

In Johnson's _History of the English Language_, page liii. it
is thus translated--

  "I wot (believe) it is sent me from heaven."

To an admirer of our Anglo-Saxon all the lines, twelve in number,
quoted by M. Todd with the above, will be found a rich treat: want
of space only prevents my giving them here.]

The modern English of the line will then be,

  _I knew well their aim was to give us ne'r a blow_.

I suspect _zitckel_ is compounded of _zitch_, such, and
the auxiliary verb _will_. _I view ame_, is _a veo
o'm_; that is, _a few of them_. _Emethee_, is
_emmtey_, that is, abounding with ants. _Meulten away_,
is melting away.

  _Th'ast ee pait it, thee'st a paid it_; thou hast paid it.

In the _English translation_ which accompanies the original
_song_ in _General Vallancey's_ paper, some of the words
are, I think, beyond controversy misinterpreted, but I have not
room to go critically through it. All I desire should be inferred
from these remarks is, that, although this _Anglo-Saxon_
curiosity is well worthy the attention of those who take an
interest in our early literature, we must be careful not to assume
that it is a pure specimen of the language of the period to which,
and of the people to whom, it is said to relate.


A GLOSSARY OF WORDS COMMONLY USED IN THE County of Somerset,

These words are in very common use in the West of England. It is
curious to note their gradation from Chaucer, whose expression is
_Beren hem on hond_, or _bare him on hand_; implying
always, it appears to me, the same meaning as I have given to the
words above. There is, I think, no doubt, that these expressions
of Chaucer, which he has used several times in his works, are
figurative; when Chaucer tells us he _beren hem, in hond,_
the literal meaning is, he carried it in, or on, his hand so that
it might be readily seen. "_To bear on hand_, to affirm, to
relate."--JAMIESON'S Etymological Scots Dictionary. But, whatever
be the meaning of these words in Chaucer, and at the present time
in Scotland, the above is the meaning of them in the west of
England.

Banes. _s. pl._ The banns of matrimony.

LORD BYRON has used the verb _begrudge_ in his notes to the
2nd canto of Childe Harold.

Begor'z, Begum'mers. _interj._

These words are, most probably, oaths of asseveration. The last
appears to be a corruption of _by godmothers_. Both are
thrown into discourse very frequently: _Begummers, I ont tell; I
cant do it begorz._

Begrumpled. _part._ Soured; offended.

To Belg. _v. n._ To cry aloud; to bellow.

phloxinus._

Bird-battin. _s._ The catching of birds with a net and lights
by night. FIELDING uses the expression.

Bird-battin-net. _s._ The net used in bird-battin.

[In Johnson's Dictionary this is spelt _bore_; I prefer the
above spelling. I believe the word is derived from the animal
_Boar_, from the noise, rushing, and impetuosity of the
water, Todd gives it "a tide swelling above another tide." Writers
vary in their opinions on the causes of this phenomenon. St.
Pierre. Ouvres, tom vi., p. 234, Ed. Hamburgh, 1797, describes it
not exactly the same in the Seine as in the Parret:--"Cette
montagne d'eau est produite par les marèes qui entrent, de la mer
dans la Seine, et la font refluer contre son cours. On l'appelle
la _Barre_, parce-qu'elle _barre_ le cours de la Seine.
Cette barre est suivée d'une seconde barre plus elevèe, qui la
suit a cent toises de distance. Elles courent beaucoup plus vîte
qu'un cheval au galop." He says it is called _Bar_, because
it _bars_ the current. In the Encyclop. Metropol., art.
_Bore_, the editor did not seem more fortunate in his
derivation.]

bobbish_, pretty well.] Bonk. _s._ Bank.

But. _s._ A conical and peculiar kind of basket or trap used
in large numbers for catching salmon in the river Parret. The term
_but_, would seem to be a generic one, the actual meaning of
which I do not know; it implies, however, some containing vessel
or utensil. _See_ BEE-BUT. _But_, applied to beef,
always means _buttock._

Butter-and-eggs. _s._ A variety of the daffodil.

Bwile. _v._ Boil.

Bwye. _interj._ Bye! adieu. This, as well as _good-bye_
and _good-bwye_, is evidently corrupted from _God be with

God. Bwye, and good-bwye, are, therefore, how vulgar soever they
may seem, more analogous than _bye_ and _good-bye_.

some farmer; a school-mistress is also sometimes called dame
(dame-schools).

gift of the _divining rod_, as it has been sometimes called;
by the French, _Baguette Devinatoire_.

_Ray_, in his _Catalogus Plantarum Angliæ, &c._, Art.
_Corylus_, speaks of the divining rod: " Vulgus metallicorum
ad virgulam divinum, ut vocant, quâ venas metallorum inquírit præ
cæteris furcam eligit colurnam." More may be seen in John Bauhin.

Dunch, (Dunce?). _adj._ Deaf.

As a deaf person is very often, apparently at least, stupid; a
stupid, intractable person is, therefore, called a DUNCE: one who
is deaf and intractable. What now becomes of _Duns Scotus_,
and all the rest of the recondite observations bestowed upon
DUNCE?--_See_ GROSE.

I have no doubt that _Dunch_ is Anglo-Saxon, although I
cannot find it in any of our old dictionaries, except Bailey's.

 _Nettle in, Docke out_, now this, now that, Pandare?"

 _Troilus and Cressida_, Book IV.

The round-dock leaves are used at this day as a supposed remedy or
charm for the sting of a nettle, by being rubbed on the stung
part, with the following words:--

 _In dock, out nettle,
 Nettle have a sting'd me_.

That is, _Go in dock, go out nettle_. Now, to play _Nettle
in Docke out_, is to make use of such expedients as shall drive
away or remove some previous evil, similar to that of driving out
the venom of the nettle by the juice or charm of the dock.

Utch'y. _pron._ I. This word is not used in the Western or
Eastern, but only in the Southern parts of the County of Somerset.
It is, manifestly, a corrupt pronunciation of _Ich_, or
_Ichè_, pronounced as two syllables, the Anglo-Saxon word for
I. _What shall utchy do?_ What shall I do.

I think Chaucer sometimes uses _iche_ as a dissyllable;
_vide_ his Poems _passim_. _Ch'am_, is I am, that
is, _ich am_; _ch'ill_, is I will, _ich will_. See
Shakespeare's King Lear, Act IV., Scene IV. What is very
remarkable, and which confirms me greatly in the opinion which I
here state, upon examining the first folio edition of Shakespeare,
at the London Institution, I find that _ch_ is printed, in
one instance, with a mark of elision before it thus, _'ch_, a
proof that the _i_ in _iche_ was sometimes dropped in a
common and rapid pronunciation. In short, this mark of elision
ought always so to have been printed, which would, most probably,
have prevented the conjectures which have been hazarded upon the
origin of the mean- of such words _chudd_, _chill_, and
_cham_. It is singular enough that Shakespeare has the
_ch_ for _iche_ I, and _Ise_ for I, within the
distance of a few lines in the passage above alluded to, in King
Lear. But, perhaps, not more singular than that in Somersetshire
may, at the present time, be heard for the pronoun I,
_Utchy_, or _iché_, and _Ise_. In the Western parts
of Somersetshire, as well as in Devonshire, _Ise_ is now used
very generally for I. The Germans of the present day pronounce, I
understand, their _ich_ sometimes as it is pronounced in the
West, _Ise_, which is the sound we give to frozen water,
_ice_. See Miss Ham's letter, towards the conclusion of this
work.

POEMS AND OTHER PIECES EXEMPLIFYING THE DIALECT OF THE

County of Somersetshire.


Notwithstanding the Author has endeavoured, in the Observations on
the Dialects of the West, and in The Glossary, to obviate the
difficulties under which strangers to the dialect of Somersetshire
may, very possibly, labour in the perusal of the following Poems,
it may be, perhaps, useful here to remind the reader, that many
mere inversions of sound, and differences in pronunciation, are
not noted in the Glossary. That it did not appear necessary to
explain such words as_ wine, _wind;_ zâ, _say;_ qut,
_coat;_ bwile, _boil_; hoss, _horse;_ hirches,
_riches; and many others, which it is presumed the_ context,
_the_ Observations, _or the_ Glossary, _will
sufficiently explain. The Author, therefore, trusts, that by a
careful attention to these, the reader will soon become_ au
fait _at the interpretation of these West-country_ LIDDENS.


GOOD BWYE TA THEE COT!


  Good bwye ta thee Cot! whaur tha dâs o' my childhood

[Footnote: The humble-bee, _bombilius major_, or
_dumbledore_, makes holes very commonly in mud walls, in which
it deposits a kind of farina: in this bee will be found, on
dissection, a considerable portion of honey, although it never
deposits any.]

  Good bwye ta the Cot!--on thy drashel, a-mâ-be,

  Good bwye ye dun Elves! who, on whings made o'leather,

FANNY FEAR


The melancholy incident related in the following story, actually
occurred a few years ago at Shapwick.


  Good Gennel-vawk! an if you please
    To lissen to my storry,
  A mâ-be 'tis a jitch a one,
    Ool make ye zummet zorry.

  'Tis not a hoozay tale of grief,
    A put wi' ort together,
  That where you cry, or where you laugh,
    Da matter not a veather;

  Bit 'tis a tale vor sartin true,
    Wi' readship be it spawken;
  I knaw it all, begummers! well,
    By tale, eese, an by tawken.

  The maid's right name war FANNY FEAR,
    A tidy body lookin;
  An she cood brew, and she cood bake,
  An dumplins bwile, and skimmer cake;
    An all the like o' cookin.

  Upon a Zunday âternoon,
    Beforne the door a stanin,
  To zee er chubby cheaks za hird,
  An whitist lilies roun 'em spird,
    A damas rawze her han in,

  Ood do your hort good; an er eyes,
    Dork, vull, an bright, an sporklin;
  Tha country lads could not goo by,
  Bit look thâ must--she iver shy,
    Ood blish--tha timid lorklin!

  Her dame war to her desperd kind;
    She knaw'd er well dezarvin:
  She gid her good advice an claws,
  At which she niver toss'd her naws,
    As zum ool, thawf pon starvin.

  She oten yarly upp'd to goo
    A milkin o' tha dairy;
  The meads ring'd loudly wi' er zong;
  Aw how she birshed the grass along,
    As lissom as a vairy!

  She war as happy as a prince;
    Naw princess moor o' pleasure
  When well-at-eased cood iver veel;
  She ly'd her head upon her peel,
    An vound athin a treasure.

  There war a dessent comly youth,
    Who took'd to her a likin;
  An when a don'd in zunday claws,
  You'd thenk en zummet I suppaws,
    A look'd so desperd strikin.

  His vace war like a zummer dâ,
    When âll the birds be zingin;
  Smiles an good nature dimplin stood,
    An moor besides, an  âll za good,
  Much pleasant promise bringin.

  Now Jan war sawber, and afeard
    Nif he in haste shood morry,
  That he mid long repent thereof;
    An zo a thwart 'twar best not, thawf
    To stâ mid make en zorry.

  Jan oten pâss'd the happy door,
    There Fanny stood a scrubbin;
  An Fanny hired hiz pleasant voice,
  An thawt--"An if she had er choice!"
     An veel'd athin a drubbin.

  Bit Jan did'n hulder long iz thawts;
    Vor thorough iv'ry cranny,
  Hirn'd of iz Lort tha warm hird tide;
  An a cood na moor iz veelins bide,
    Bit tell 'em must to Fanny.

  To Fanny, than, one Whitsun eve,
    A tawld er how a lov'd er;
  Naw dove, a zed to er cood be
  Moor faithvul than to her ood he;
    His hort had long appruv'd er.

  Wi' timourous blishin, Fanny zed,
  "A maid mist not believe ye;
  Vor men ool tell ther lovin tale,
  And awver seely maids prevail--
  Bit I dwont like ta grieve ye:

  Vor nif za be you now zâ true--
  That you've for I a fancy:
   (Aw Jan! I dwont veel desperd well,
  An what's tha câze, I cannot tell),
  You'll zâ na moor to Nancy."

  Twar zaw begin'd their zweetortin;
  Booäth still liv'd in their places;
  Zometimes thâ met bezides tha stile;
  Wi' pleasant look an tender smile
  Gaz'd in each wither's faces.

  In spreng-time oten on tha nap
  Ood Jan and Fanny linger;
  An when war vooäs'd to zâ "good bwye,"
  Ood meet again, wi' draps in eye,
  While haup ood pwint er vinger.

  Zo pass'd tha dâs--tha moons awâ,
  An haup still whiver'd nigh;
  Nif Fanny's dreams high pleasures vill,
  Of her Jan's thawts the lidden still,
  An oten too the zigh.

  Bit still Jan had not got wherewi'
    To venter eet to morry;
  Alas-a-dâ! when poor vawk love,
  How much restraint how many pruv;
    How zick zum an how zorry.

  Aw you who live in houzen grate,
    An wherewi' much possessin,
  You knaw not, mâ-be, care not you,
  What pangs jitch tender horts pursue,
      How grate nor how distressin.

  Jan sar'd a varmer vour long years,
    An now iz haups da brighten:
  A gennelman of high degree
  Choos'd en iz hunsman vor to be;
    His Fanny's hort da lighten!

  "Now, Fan," zed he, "nif I da live,
    Nex zummer thee bist mine;
  Sir John ool gee me wauges good,
  Amâ-be too zum viër ood!"
    His Fan's dork eyes did shine.

  "To haw vor thee, my Fan," a cried,
    "I iver sholl delight;
  Thawf I be poor, 'tool be my pride
  To ha my Fan vor a buxom bride--
    My lidden dâ an night."

  A took er gently in iz orms
    An kiss'd er za zweetly too;
  His Fan, vor jay, not a word cood speak,
  Bit a big roun tear rawl'd down er cheak,
  It zimm'd as thawf er hort ood break--
    She cood hordly thenk it true.

  To zee our hunsman goo abroad,
    His houns behind en volly;
  His tossel'd cap--his whip's smort smack,
  His hoss a prancin wi' tha crack,
  His whissle, horn, an holler, back!
    Ood cure âll malancholy.

  It happ'd on a dork an wintry night,
    Tha stormy wine a blawin;
  Tha houns made a naise an a dismal yell;
  Jitch as zum vawk zâ da death vaurtell,
    The cattle loud war lawin.

  Tha hunsman wâkid an down a went;
    A thawt ta keep 'em quiet;
  A niver stopped izzel ta dress,
  Bit a went in iz shirt vor readiness
    A voun a dirdful riot.

  Bit âll thic night a did not come back;
    All night tha dogs did raur;
  In tha mornin thâ look'd on tha kannel stwons
  An zeed 'em cover'd wi' gaur an bwons,
    The vlesh âll vrom 'em a taur.

  His head war left--the head o' Jan
    Who lov'd hiz Fanny za well;
  An a bizzy gossip, as gossips be
  Who've work o' ther awn bit vrom it vlee,
    To Fanny went ta tell.

  She hirn'd, she vleed ta meet tha man
    Who corr'd er dear Jan's head:
  An when she zeed en âll blood an gaur,
  She drapp'd down speechless jist avaur,
    As thauf she had bin dead.

  Poor Fanny com'd ta erzel again,
    Bit her senses left her vor iver!
  An all she zed, ba dâ or night--
  Vor sleep it left her eye-lids quite--
  War, "why did he goo in the cawld ta shiver?--
      Niver, O Jan! sholl I zee the, niver!"

JERRRY NUTTY; OR THE MAN OF MORK.


  Awa wi' âll yer tales o' grief,
  An dismal storry writin;

  A mâ-be zumthin I mâ zing
    Ool be as much delightin.

  Zumtime agoo, bevaur tha moors
    War tin'd in, lived at Mork
  One JERRY NUTTY--spry a war;
    A upp'd avaur the lork.

  Iz vather in a little cot
    Liv'd, auver-right tha moor,
  An thaw a kipt a vlock o' geese,
    A war a thoughted poor.

  A niver teach'd tha cris-cross-lain
    Ta any of his bways,
  An Jerry, mangst the rest o'm, did
    Not much appruv his ways.

  Vor Jerry zumtimes went ta church
    Ta hire tha Pâson preach,
  An thawt what pity that ta read
    Izzel a cood'n teach.

  Vor than, a zunday âternoon,
    Tha Bible, or good book
  Would be companion vit vor'm âll
    Who choos'd therein ta look.

  Bit Jerry than tha naise o' geese
    Bit little moor could hire;

  An dâly goose-aggs ta pick up
    Droo-out tha moor did tire.

  A ôten look'd upon tha hills
    An stickle mountains roun,
  An wished izzel upon their taps:
    What zights a ood be bóun!

  Bit what did mooäst iz fancy strick
    War Glassenberry Torr:
  A âlways zeed it when tha zun
    Gleam'd wi' tha mornin stor.

  O' Well's grate church a ôten hired,
    Iz fancy war awake;
  An zaw a thawt that zoon a ood
    A journey ta it make.

  An Glassenberry's Torr, an Thorn
    The hawly blowth of which
  A hired from one and tother too;
    Tha like war never jitch!

  Bit moor o' this I need not zâ,
    Vor off went Jerry Nutty,
  In hiz right hon a wâkin stick,
    An in hiz qut a tutty.

  Now, lock-y-zee! in whimly dress
    Trudg'd chearful Jerry on;

  Bit on tha moor not vur a went--
    A made a zudden ston.

  Which wâ ta goo a cood not thenk,
    Vor there war many a wâ;
  A put upright iz walking stick;
    A vâll'd ta tha zon o' dâ.

  Ta tha suthard than iz wâ a took
    Athert tha turfy moors,
  An zoon o' blissom Cuzziton,
[Footnote: Cossington.]
    A pass'd tha cottage doors.

  Tha maidens o' tha cottages,
  Not us'd strange vawk to zee,
Com'd vooäth and stood avaur tha door;
  Jer wonder'd what cood be.

  Zum smil'd, zum whecker'd, zum o'm blish'd.
    "Od dang it!" Jerry zed,
  "What do tha think that I be like?"
    An nodded to 'm iz head.

  "Which is tha wâ to Glassenberry?
    I've hired tha hawly thorn
  War zet there by zum hawly hons
    Zoon âter Christ war born;

  An I've a mine ta zee it too,
    An o' tha blowth ta take."
  "An how can you, a seely man,
    Jitch seely journey make?

  "What! dwont ye knaw that now about
    It is the midst o' June?
  Tha hawly thorn at Kirsmas blaws--
    You be zix months too zoon.

  Goo whim again, yea gâwky! goo!"
    Zaw zed a damsel vair
  As dewy mornin late in Mâ;
    An Jerry wide did stare.

  "Lord Miss!" zed he, "I niver thawt,
    O' Kirsmas!--while I've shoes,
  To goo back now I be zet out,
    Is what I sholl not choose.

  I'll zee the Torr an hawly thorn,
    An Glassenberry too;
  An, nif you'll put me in tha wâ,
    I'll gee grate thanks ta you."

  Goo droo thic veel an up thic lane,
    An take tha lift hon path,
  Than droo Miss Crossman's backzid strait,
    Ool bring ye up ta Wrath.

  Now mine, whaur you do turn again
    At varmer Veal's long yacker,
  Clooäse whaur Jan Lide, tha cobler, lives
    Who makes tha best o' tacker;

  You mist turn short behine tha house
    An goo right droo tha shord,
  An than you'll pass a zummer lodge,
    A builded by tha lord.

  Tha turnpick than is jist belaw,
    An Cock-hill strait avaur ye."
  Za Jerry doff'd his hat an bow'd,
    An thank'd er vor er storry.

  Bit moor o' this I need not zâ,
    Vor off went Jerry Nutty;
  In his right hand a wâkin stick,
    An in hiz qut a tutty.

  Bit I vorgot to zâ that Jer
    A zatchel wi' en took
  To hauld zum bird an cheese ta ate;--
    Iz drink war o' tha brook.

  Za when a got upon Cock-hill
    Upon a linch a zawt;
  The zun had climmer'd up tha sky;
    A voun it very hot.

  An, as iz stomick war za good,
    A made a horty meal;
  An werry war wi' wâkin, zaw
    A sleepid zoon did veel.

  That blessed power o' bâmy sleep,
    Which auver ivery sense
  Da wi' wild whiverin whings extend
    A happy influence;

  Now auver Jerry Nutty drow'd
    Er lissom mantle wide;
  An down a drapp'd in zweetest zleep,
    Iz zatchel by iz zide.

  Not all tha nasty stouts could wâke
    En vrom iz happy zleep,
  Nor emmets thick, nor vlies that buz,
    An on iz hons da creep.

  Naw dreams a had; or nif a had
    Mooäst pleasant dreams war thâ:
  O' geese an goose-aggs, ducks and jitch;
    Or Mally, vur awâ,

  Zum gennelmen war dreavin by
    In a gilded cawch za gâ;
  Thâ zeed en lyin down asleep;
    Thâ bid the cawchman stâ.

  Thâ bâll'd thâ hoop'd--a niver wâk'd;
    Naw houzen there war handy;
  Zed one o'm, "Nif you like, my bways,
    "We'll ha a little randy!"

  "Jist put en zâtly in tha cawch
    An dreav en ta Bejwâter;
  An as we âll can't g'in wi'n here,
    I'll come mysel zoon âter."

  Twar done at once: vor norn o'm car'd
    A strâ vor wine or weather;
  Than gently rawl'd the cawch along,
    As zât as any veather.

  Bit Jerry snaur'd za loud, tha naise
    Tha gennelmen did gally;
  Thâ'd hâf a mind ta turn en out;
    A war dreamin o' his Mally!

  It war the morkit dâ as rawl'd
    Tha cawch athin Bejwâter;
  Thâ drauv tip ta the Crown-Inn door,
    Ther Mâ-game man com'd âter.

  "Here Maester Wâter! Lock-y-zee!
    A-mâ-be you mid thenk
  Thic mon a snauren in tha cawch
    Is auvercome wi' drenk.

  Bit 'tis not not jitchy theng we knaw;

  Vor on Cock-hill we vound en ly'd

  Iz vace war cover'd thick wi' vlies

  Nif he'd o pumple voot bezide,
  An a brumstick vor'n to zit ascride,
  O' wizards a mid be thawt tha pride,

  "Lord zur! an why d'ye bring en here

  Why zuggers! nif we frunt en than,

  I bag ye, zur, to take en vooäth;

  Tha gennelman stood by an smiled
    To zee tha bussle risin:
  Yor zoon, droo-out tha morkit wide
    Tha news wor gwon saprisin.

  An round about tha cawch thâ dring'd--

  Wi' now an tan, an here an there,
  Amang tha crowd to gape an stare,

A  LEGEND OF GLASTONBURY.

[First Printed in "Graphic Illustrator, p. 124.]


I cannot do better than introduce here "_A Legend of
Glastonbury_," made up, not from books, but from oral tradition
once very prevalent in and near Glastonbury, which had formerly
one of the richest Abbeys in England; the ruins are still
attractive.

blossoms about Christmas; it is well known to naturalists so as
to excite no surprise."]


MR. GUY.


The incident on which this story is founded, occurred in the
early part of the last century; hence the allusion to making a
_will_ before making a journey to the metropolis.


  Mr. Guywar a gennelman
    O' Huntspill, well knawn
  As a grazier, a hirch one,
    Wi' lons o' hiz awn.

  A ôten went ta Lunnun
    Hiz cattle vor ta zill;
  All tha horses that a rawd
    Niver minded hadge or hill.

  A war afeard o' naw one;
    A niver made hiz will,
  Like wither vawk, avaur a went
    His cattle vor ta zill.

  One time a'd bin ta Lunnun
    An zawld iz cattle well;
  A brought awâ a power o' gawld,
    As I've a hired tell.

  As late at night a rawd along
    All droo a unket ood,
  A ooman rawze vrom off tha groun
    An right avaur en stood:

  She look'd za pitis Mr. Guy
    At once hiz hoss's pace
  Stapt short, a wonderin how, at night,
    She com'd in jitch a place.

  A little trunk war in her hon;
    She zim'd vur gwon wi' chile.
  She ax'd en nif a'd take her up
    And cor her a veo mile.

  Mr. Guy, a man o' veelin
    For a ooman in distress,
  Than took er up behind en:
    A cood'n do na less.

  A corr'd er trunk avaur en,
    An by hiz belt o' leather
  A bid er hawld vast; on thâ rawd,
    Athout much tâk, together.

  Not vur thâ went avaur she gid
    A whissle loud an long;
  Which Mr. Guy, thawt very strange;
    Er voice too zim'd za strong!

  She'd lost er dog, she zed; an than
    Another whissle blaw'd,
  That stortled Mr. Guy;--a stapt
    Hiz hoss upon tha rawd.

  Goo on, zed she; bit Mr. Guy
    Zum rig beginn'd ta fear:
  Vor voices rawze upon tha wine,
    An zim'd a comin near.

  Again thâ rawd along; again
    She whissled. Mr. Guy
  Whipt out hiz knife an cut tha belt,
    Then push'd er off!--Vor why?

  Tha ooman he took up behine,
    Begummers, war a _man!_
  Tha rubbers zaw ad lâd ther plots
    Our grazier to trepan.

  I shall not stap ta tell what zed
    Tha man in ooman's clawze;
  Bit he, and all o'm jist behine,
    War what you mid suppawze.

  Thâ cust, thâ swaur, thâ dreaten'd too,
    An ater Mr. Guy
  Thâ gallop'd all; 'twar niver-tha-near:
    Hiz hoss along did vly.

  Auver downs, droo dales, awâ a went,
    'Twar dâ-light now amawst,
  Till at an inn a stapt, at last,
    Ta thenk what he'd a lost.

  A lost?--why, nothin--but hiz belt!--
    A zummet moor ad gain'd:
  Thic little trunk a corr'd awâ--
    It gawld g'lore contain'd!

  Nif Mr. Guy war hirch avaur,
    A now war hircher still:
  Tha plunder o' tha highwâmen
    Hiz coffers went ta vill.

  In sâfety Mr. Guy rawd whim;
    A ôten tawld tha storry.
  Ta meet wi' jitch a rig myzel
    I shood'n, soce, be zorry.


THE ROOKERY.


The rook, _corvus frugilegus_, is a bird of considerable
intelligence,  and is, besides, extremely useful in destroying
large quantities of worms and larvæ of destructive insects. It
will, it is true, if not watched, pick out, after they are
dibbled, both pease and beans from the holes with a precision
truly astonishing: a very moderate degree of care is, however,
sufficient to prevent this evil, which is greatly overbalanced by
the positive good which it effects in the destruction of insects.
It is a remarkable fact, and not, perhaps, generally known, that
this bird rarely roosts at the rookery, except for a few months
during the period of incubation, and rearing its young. In the
winter season it more commonly takes flights of no ordinary
length, to roost on the trees of some remote and sequestered wood.
The _Elm_ is its favorite, on which it usually builds; but
such is its attachment to locality that since the incident alluded
to in the following Poem took place the Rooks have, many of them,
built in _fir_ trees at a little distance from their former
habitation. The habits of the Rook are well worthy the attention
of all who delight in the study of Natural History.


  My zong is o' tha ROOKERY,
    Not jitch as I a zeed
  On stunted trees wi' leaves a veo,
    A very veo indeed,

  In thic girt place thâ _Lunnun_ câll;--
    Tha Tower an tha Pork
  Hâ booäth a got a Rookery,
    Althaw thâ han't a Lork.

  I zeng not o' jitch Rookeries,
    Jitch plazen, pump or banners;
  Bit town-berd Rooks, vor âll that, hâ,
    I warnt ye, curious _manners_.

  My zong is o' a Rookery
    My Father's cot bezide,
  Avaur, years âter, I war born
    'Twar long tha porish pride.

  Tha elms look'd up like giants tâll
    Ther branchy yarms aspread;
  An green plumes wavin wi' tha wine,
    Made gâ each lofty head.

  Ta drâ tha pectur out--ther war
    At distance, zid between
  Tha trees, a thatch'd Form-house, an geese
    A cacklin on tha green.

  A river, too, clooäse by tha trees,
    Its stickle coose on slid,
  Whaur yells an trout an wither fish
    Mid ôtentimes be zid.

  Tha rooks voun this a pleasant place--
    A whim ther young ta rear;
  An I a ôten pleas'd a bin
    Ta wâtch 'em droo tha year.

  'Tis on tha dâ o' Valentine
    Or there or thereabout,
  Tha rooks da vast begin ta build,
    An cawin, make a rout.

  Bit aw! when May's a come, ta zee

  Vor SPOORT, an bin, as zum da zâ,

  _That nif thâ did'n shut tha, rooks
    Thâ'd zoon desert tha trees!_
  Wise vawk! Thic reason vor ther SPOORT
    Gee thâ mid nif thâ please!

  Still zeng I o' tha Rookery,
    Vor years it war tha pride
  Of all thâ place, bit 'twor ta I
    A zumthin moor bezide.

  A hired tha Rooks avaur I upp'd;
    I hired 'em droo tha dâ;
  I hired ther young while gittin flush
    An ginnin jist ta câ.

  I hired 'em when my mother gid
    Er lessins kind ta I,
  In jitch a wâ when I war young,
    That I war fit ta cry.

  I hired 'em at tha cottage door,
    When mornin, in tha spreng,
  Wâk'd vooäth in youth an beauty too,
    An birds beginn'd ta zeng.

  I hired 'em in tha winter-time
    When, roustin vur awâ,
  Thâ visited tha Rookery
    A whiverin by dâ.

  My childhood, youth, and manood too,
    My Father's cot recâll
  Thic Rookery. Bit I mist now
    Tell what it did bevâll.

  'Twar Mâ-time--heavy vi' tha nests
    War laden âll tha trees;
  An to an fraw, wi' creekin loud,
    Thâ sway'd ta iv'ry breeze.

  One night tha wine--a thundrin wine,
    Jitch as war hired o' nivor,
  Blaw'd two o' thic girt giant trees
    Flat down into tha river.

  Nests, aggs, an young uns, âll awâ
    War zweept into tha wâter
  An zaw war spwiled tha Rookery
    Vor iver and iver âter.

  I visited my Father's cot:
    Tha Rooks war âll a gwon;
  Whaur stood tha trees in lofty pride
    I zid there norra one.

  My Father's cot war desolate;
    An âll look'd wild, vorlorn;
  Tha Ash war stunted that war zet

  My Father, Mother, Rooks, âll gwon!

  Behawld tha wâ o' human thengs!

  A kill'd, taur up, like leaves drap off!--
    Zaw feaver'd bein ends.


TOM GOOL, AND LUCK IN THA BAG.


  "Luck, Luck in tha Bag! Good Luck!
    Put in an try yer fortin;
  Come, try yer luck in tha Lucky Bag!
    You'll git a prize vor sartin."

  Mooäst plazen hâ their customs
    Ther manners an ther men;
  We too a got our customs,
    Our manners and our men.

    Or Highbridge--Pawlet Revel--
  Or Burtle Sassions, whaur thâ plâ

    That war a câll'd TOM GOOL;
  Zum thawt en mazed, while withers thawt
    En moor a knave than fool.

  At all tha fâyers an revels too
    TOM GOOL war shower ta be,
  A tâkin vlother vast awâ,--

  Vor' âll that a had a zoort o' wit
    That zet tha vawk a laughin;
  An mooäst o' that, when ho tha yal
    Ad at tha fâyer bin quaffin.

  A corr'd a kit o' pedlar's waur,
    Like awld _Joannah Martin_;
[Footnote: This Lady, who was for many years known in
Somersetshire as an itinerant dealer in earthenware, rags, &c.,
and occasionally a _fortune-teller_, died a few years since
at Huntspill, where she had resided for the greater part of a
century. She was extremely illiterate, so much so, as not to be
able to write, and, I think, could scarcely read. She lived for
some years in a house belonging to my father, and while a boy, I
was very often her gratuitous amanuensis, in writing letters for
her to her children. She possessed, however, considerable
shrewdness, energy, and perseverance, and amassed property to the
amount of several hundred pounds. She had three husbands; the
name of the first was, I believe, _Gool_ or _Gould_, a
relation of _Thomas Gool_, the subject of the above Poem; the
name of the second was _Martin_, of the third _Pain_;
but as the last lived a short time only after having married her,
she always continued to be called Joannah Martin.

_Joannah_ was first brought into public notice by the Rev.
Mr. WARNER, in his _Walks through the Western Counties_,
published in 1800, in which work will be found a lively and
interesting description of her; but she often said that she
should wish me to write her life, as I was, of course, more
intimately acquainted with it than any casual inquirer could
possibly be. An additional notice of Joannah was inserted by
me in the _Monthly Magazine_, for Nov. 1816, page 310. I had
among my papers, the _original song composed_ by her, which I
copied from her dictation many years ago,--the only, copy in
existence; I regret that I cannot lay my hand upon it; as it
contains much of the Somersetshire idiom. I have more than once
heard her sing this song, which was satirical, and related to the
conduct of a female, one of her neighbours, who had become a
thief.

Such was JOANNAH MARTIN, a woman whose name (had she moved in a
sphere where her original talents could have been improved by
education,) might have been added to the list of distinguished
female worthies of our country.

[The MS. song was never, that I am aware of, discovered
after my relative's death.--Editor, J. K. J.]]
  An nif yon hân't a hired o' her,
    You zumtime sholl vor sartin.

  "Luck, Luck in tha Bag!" TOM, cried
    "Put in and try yer fortin;
  Come try yer luck in tha lucky bag;
    You'll git a prize vor sartin.

  All prizes, norra blank,
    Norra blank, âll prizes!
  A waiter--knife--or scissis sheer--

My Dear Jane.


Will you do me the favour to amuse yourself and your friends with
the enclosed epistle? it is certainly  an original--written in the
dialect of the County. You will easily understand it, and, I do
not doubt, the "moril" too.

Edward Band, or as he is more commonly called here, Teddy Band, is
a poor, but honest and industrious cottager, but I am,
nevertheless, disposed to think that "if ignorance is bliss, 'tis
folly to be wise."

My dear Jane, affectionately yours,

MARIA HANSON.

THE CHURCHWARDEN.

  Upon a time, naw matter whaur,
  Jitch plazen there be many a scaur
    In Zummerzet's girt gorden;
    (Ive hir'd 'twar handy ta tha zea,
  Not vur vrom whaur tha zantots be)
    There liv'd a young churchwarden.

  A zim'd delighted when put in.
  An zaw a thawt a ood begin
    Ta do hiz office duly:
  Bit zum o'm, girt vawk in ther wâ--
    Tha _Porish_ o'ten câlled,--a girt bell sheep
    Or two that lead the rest an quiet keep--
  Put vooäth ther hons iz coose to stâ,
    Which made en quite unruly.

  A went, of coose, ta Visitâtion
  Ta be sworn in;--an than 'twar nâtion
  Hord that a man his power should doubt,--
  An moor--ta try ta turn en out!
  "Naw, Naw!" exclaim'd our young churchwarden,
  I dwon't care vor ye âll a copper varden!"

  Tha church war durty.--Wevets here
  Hang'd danglin vrom tha ruf; an there
   Tha plaisterin shaw'd a crazy wâll;

  Tha âltar-piece war dim and dowsty too,
  That Peter's maricle thâ scase cood view.
  Tha Ten Commandments nawbody cood rade; [Footnote: Read]
  Tha Lord's Prayer ad nuthin in't bit "Brade;" [Footnote: Bread]
    Nor had tha Creed
  A lain or letter parfit, grate or smâll.
  'Twar time vor zum one ta renew 'em âll.

  I've tawld o' wevets--zum o'm odd enow;
  Thâ look'd tha colour of a dork dun cow,
    An like a skin war stratched across tha corners;
  Tha knitters o' tha porish tâk'd o knittin
  Stocking wi' 'em!--Bit aw, how unbevittin
    All tâk like this!--aw fie, tha wicked scorners!

  Ta work went tha Churchwarden; wevets tummel'd
  Down by tha bushel, an tha pride o' dowst war hummel'd.
    Tha wâlls once moor look'd bright.
  Tha Painter, fags, a war a Plummer
    An Glazier too,
    Put vooäth his powers,
   (His workin made naw little scummer!)
  In zentences, in flourishes, and flowers.
  Tha chancel, church and âll look'd new,
    An war well suited to avoord delight.

  Tha Ten Commandments glitter'd wi' tha vornish;
  Compleat now, tha Lord's Prayer, what cood tornish.

  As vor tha Creed 'twar made bran new
  Vrom top ta bottom;  I tell ye true!
  Tha âltar piece wi' Peter war now naw libel
    Upon tha church,
  Which booäth athin an, tower an all, athout
  Look'd like a well-dressed maid in pride about;
  Tha walls rejâic'd wi' texts took vrom tha Bible.
    Bit vor all that, thâ left en in tha lurch; I bag your pardon.
  I mean, of âll tha expense thâ ood'n pâ a varden.

  Jitch zweepin, birshin, paintin, scrubbin;
  Tha tuts ad niver jitch a drubbin;
    Jitch white-washin and jitch brought gwâin
  A power of money--Tha Painter's bill
  Made of itzel a pirty pill,
    Ta zwell which âll o'm tried in vain!
  Ther stomicks turn'd, ther drawts were norry; [Footnote: Narrow]
  Jitch gillded pills thâ cood'n corry.
  An when our young churchwarden ax'd em why,
  Thâ laugh'd at en, an zed, ther drawts war dry.

  Tha keeper o' tha church war wrong;
   (Churchwarden still the burden o' my zong)
    A should at vust
  A câll'd a Vestry: vor 'tis hord ta trust
  To Porish generasity; an zaw
  A voun it: I dwon' knaw

  Whaur or who war his advisers;
    Zum zed a Lâyer gid en bad advice;
    A-mâ-be saw; jitch vawk ben't always nice.
  Lâyers o' advice be seltimes misers
    Nif there's wherewi' ta pâ;
  Or, witherwise, good bwye ta Lâyers an tha Lâ.

  A Vestry than at last war cried--
  A Vestry's power let noäne deride--
  When tha church war auver tha clork bal'd out,
    _Aw eese! aw eese! aw eese!_
  All wonder'd what cood be about,
    An stratch'd ther necks like a vlock o' geese;
    Why--_ta make a Rate
    Vor tha church's late
    Repairâtion_.
    A grate norâtion,
  A nâtion naise tha nawtice made,
  About tha cost ta be defray'd
    Vor tha church's _repairâtion_.

  Tha Vestry met, âll naise an bother;
  One ood'n wait ta hire tha tuther.
  When thâ war tir'd o' jitch a gabble,
  Ta bâl na moor not one war yable,
  A man, a little zâtenfare,
  Got up hiz verdi ta delcare.
  Now Soce, zed he, why we be gwâin
  Ta meet in Vestry here in vâin.

  Let's come to some determination,
  An not tâk âll in jitch a fashion.
  Let's zee tha 'counts. A snatch'd tha book

  _Tha, book war chain'd clooäse to his wrist;_
  A gid en slily jitch a twist!
  That the young Churchwarden loud raur'd out,
  "You'll break my yarm!--what be about?"

  Tha man a little zâtenfare,
  An âll tha Vestry wide did stare!
  Bit Soce, zed he again, I niver zeed
  Money brought gwâin zaw bad. What need
  War ther tha âltar-piece ta titch?
  What good war paintin, vornishin, an jitch?
  What good war't vor'n ta mend
  Tha Ten Commandments?--Why did he
  Mell o' tha Lord's Prayer?    Lockyzee!
    Ther war naw need
  To mell or make wi' thic awld Creed.
  I'm zorry vor'n; eesse zorry as a friend;
  Bit can't conzent our wherewi' zaw ta spend,

    Thâ âll, wi one accord,
    At tha little zâtenfare's word,
        Agreed, that, not one varden,
          By Rate,
     Should be collected vor tha late Repairâtion
    Of tha church by tha young Churchwarden.


THE FISHERMAN AND THE PLAYERS.


  Now who is ther that han't a hir'd
    O' one young TOM CAME?
  A Fisherman of Huntspill,
    An a well-knawn name.

  A knaw'd much moor o' fishin
    Than many vawk bezides;
  An a knaw'd much moor than mooäst about
    Tha zea an âll tha tides.

  A knaw'd well how ta make buts,
    An hullies too an jitch,
  An up an down tha river whaur
    Tha best place vor ta pitch.

  A knaw'd âll about tha stake-hangs
    Tha zâlmon vor ta catch;--
  Tha pitchin an tha dippin net,--
    Tha Slime an tha Mud-Batch.
[Footnote: Two islands well known in the River Parret, near its
mouth. Several words will be found in this Poem which I have not
placed in the _Glossary_, because they seem too local and
technical to deserve a place there: they shall be here explained,

_To Pitch, v.n._ To fish with a boat and a pitchin-net in a
proper position across the current so that the fish may be caught.

_Pitchin-net. s._ A large triangular net attached to two
poles, and used with a boat for the purpose, chiefly, of catching
salmon.--The fishing boats in the Parret, are _flat-
bottomed_, in length about seventeen feet, about four feet and
a half wide, and pointed at both ends: they are easily managed by
_one_ person, and rarely, if ever, known to overturn.

_Dippen-net. s._ A small net somewhat semicircular, and
attached to two round sticks for sides, and a long pole for a
handle. It is used for the purpose of _dipping salmon_ and
some other fish, as the _shad_, out of water.

_Gad. s._ A long pole, having an iron point to it, so that it
may be easily thrust into the ground. Two gads are used for each
boats. Their uses are to keep the boat steady across the current
in order that the net may be in a proper position.]

  A handled too iz gads well
    His paddle and iz oor;
[Footnote: Oar.]
  A war âlways bawld an fearless--
    A, when upon tha Goor.
[Footnote: The Gore. Dangerous sands so called, at the mouth of
the River Parret, in the Bristol Channel.]

  O' heerins, sprats, an porpuses--
    O' âll fish a cood tell;
  Who bit he amangst tha Fishermen--
    A âlways bear'd tha bell.

  Tommy Came ad hired o' Plâyers,
    Bit niver zeed 'em plâ;
  Thâ war actin at Bejwâter;
      There a went wi' Sally Dâ.

  When tha curtain first drâw'd up, than
    Sapriz'd war Tommy Came;
  A'd hâf a mine ta him awâ,
   Bit stapp'd vor very shame.

  Tha vust act bein auver
    Tha zecond jist begun,
  Tommy Came still wonder'd grately,
    Ta him it war naw fun.

  Zaw âter lookin on zumtime,
    Ta understand did strive;
  _There now_, zed he, _I'll gee my woth_
[Footnote: Oath.]
    _That thâ be all alive!_

DOCTOR COX; A BLANSCUE.

_(First printed in the Graphic Illustrator.)_


The catastrophe described in the following sketch, occurred near
_Highbridge_, in Somersetshire, about the year 1779.--Mr. or
_Doctor Cox_, as surgeons are usually called in the west, was
the only medical resident  at Huntspill, and in actual practice
for many miles around that village. The conduct of Mr. Robert
Evans, the friend and associate of Cox, can only be accounted for
by one of those unfortunate infatuations  to which the minds of
some are sometimes liable. Had an immediate alarm been given when
we children first discovered that Cox was missing, he might,
probably, have been saved. The real cause of his death was, a too
great abstraction of heat from the body; as the water was fresh
and still, and of considerable depth, and, under the surface, much
beneath the usual temperature of the human body. This fact ought
to be a lesson to those who bathe in still and deep fresh water;
and to warn them to continue only a short time in such a cold
medium. [Footnote: Various efforts to restore the suspended
animation of _Cox,_ such as shaking him, rolling him on a
cask, attempts to get out the water which it was then presumed had
got into the stomach or the lungs, or both, in the drowning;
strewing salt over the body, and many other equally ineffectual
and improper methods to restore the circulation were, I believe,
pursued. Instead of which, had the body been laid in a natural
position, and the lost heat gradually administered, by the
application of warm frictions, a warm bed, &c., how easily in all
probability, would animation have been restored!]

  The BRUE war bright, and deep and clear;
[Footnote: The reader must not suppose that the _river Brue,_
is generally a clear stream, or always rapid. I have elsewhere
called it "lazy Brue." It is sometimes, at and above the
floodgates at _Highbridge,_ when they are not closed by the
tide, a rapid stream; but through the moors, generally, its course
is slow. In the summertime, and at the period to which allusion is
made, the floodgates were closed.]
  And Lammas dâ and harras near:
  The zun upon the waters drode
  Girt sheets of light as on a rode;
  From zultry heät the cattle hirn'd
  To shade or water as to firnd:
  Men, too, in yarly âternoon
  Doft'd quick ther cloaths and dash'd in zoon
  To thic deep river, whaur the trout,
  In all ther prankin, plâd about;
  And yels wi' zilver skins war zid,
  While gudgeons droo the wâter slid,
  Wi' carp sumtimes and wither fish
  Avoordon many a dainty dish.
  Whaur elvers too in spring time plâd,
[Footnote: Young eels are called _elvers_ in Somersetshire.
_Walton_, in his Angler, says, "Young eels, in the Severn,
are called _yelvers_." In what part of the country through
which the Severn passes they are called yelvers we are not told in
Walton's book; as eels are called, in Somersetshere, yels, analogy
seems to require _yelvers_ for their young; but I never heard
them so called. The elvers used to be obtained from the salt-water
side of the bridge.]
  And pailvuls mid o' them be had.
  The wâter cold--the zunshine bright,
  To zwiminers than what high delight!
  'Tis long agwon whun youth and I
  Wish'd creepin Time would rise and vly--
  A, half a hundred years an moor
  Zunz I a trod theäze earthly vloor!
  I zed, the face o' Brue war bright;
  Time smil'd too in thic zummer light.
  Wi' Hope bezide en promising
  A wordle o' fancies wild ö' whing.
  I mine too than one lowering cloud
  That zim'd to wrop us like a shroud;
  The death het war o' Doctor Cox--
  To thenk o't now the storry shocks!
  Vor âll the country vur and near
  Shod than vor'n many a horty tear.
  The _Doctor_ like a duck could zwim;
  No fear o' drownin daver'd him!
  The pectur now I zim I zee!
  I wish I could liet's likeness gee!
  His _Son_, my brother _John, myzel_,
  Or _Evans_, mid the storry tell;
  But thâ be gwon and I, o' âll
  O'm left to zâ what did bevâll.
  Zo, nif zo be you like, why I
  To tell the storry now ool try.

  Thic _Evans_had a coward core
  And fear'd to venter vrom the shore;
  While to an vro, an vur an near,
  And now an tan did _Cox_ appear
  In dalliance with the wâters bland,
  Or zwimmin wi' a maëster hand.
  We youngsters dree, the youngest I,
  To zee the zwimmers âll stood by
  Upon the green bonk o' the Brue
  Jist whaur a stook let water droo:
  A quiet time of joyousness
  Zim'd vor a space thic dâ to bless!
  A dog' too, faithful to his maëster
  War there, and mang'd wi' the disaster--
  _Vigo_, ah well I mine his name!
  A Newvoun-lond and very tame!
  But Evans only war to blame:
  He âllès paddled near the shore
  Wi' timid hon and coward core;
  While _Doctor Cox_ div'd, zwim'd at ease
  Like fishes in the zummer seas;
  Or as the skaiters on the ice
  In winin circles wild and nice
  Yet in a moment he war gwon,
  The wonderment of ivry one:
  That is, we _dree_ and Evans, âll
  That zeed what Blanscue did bevâll.--
  Athout one sign, or naise, or cry,
  Or shriek, or splash, or groan, or sigh!
  Could zitch a zwimmer ever die
  In wâter?--Yet we gaz'd in vain
  Upon thic bright and wâter plain:
  All smooth and calm--no ripple gave
  One token of the zwimmer's grave!
  We hir'd en not, we zeed en not!--
  The glassy wâter zim'd a blot?
  While Evans, he of coward core,
  Still paddled as he did bevore!
  At length our fears our silence broke,--
  Young as we war, and children âll,
  We wish'd to goo an zum one câll;
  But Evans carelissly thus spoke--
  "Oh, _Cox_ is up the river gone,
  Vor sartain ool be back anon;--
  He tâlk'd o' cyder, zed he'd g'up
  To Stole's an drenk a horty cup!"
[Footnote: Mr. Stole resided near _Newbridge_, about a mile
from the spot where the accident occurred; he was somewhat famous
for his cyder.]
  Conjecture anty as the wine!
  And zoon did he het's faleshood vine.

  _John Cox_ took up his father's cloaths--
  Poor fellow! he beginn'd to cry!
  Than, Evans vrom the wâter rose;
  "A hunderd vawk'll come bimeby,"
  A zed; whun, short way vrom the shore.
  We zeed, what zeed we not avore,
  The _head_ of Doctor Cox appear--
  Het floated in the wâter clear!
  Bolt upright war he, and his hair,
  That pruv'd he sartainly war there,
  Zwimm'd on the wâter!--Evans than,
  The stupid'st of a stupid man,
  Call'd _Vigo_--pointed to that head--
  In _Vigo_ dash'd--_Cox was not dead_!
  But seiz'd the dog's lag--helt en vast!
  One struggle, an het war the last!
  Ah! well do I remember it--
  That struggle I sholl ne'er forgit!
  Vigo was frightened and withdrew;
  The body zink'd at once vrom view.

  Did _Evans_, gallid _Evans_ then,
  Câll out, at once, vor father's men?
  (Thâ war at work vor'n very near
  A mendin the old Highbridge pier,)
  A did'n câll, but 'mus'd our fear--
  "A hundred vawk ool zoon be here!"
  A zed.--We gid the hue and cry!
  And zoon a booät wi' men did vly!
  But twar âll auver!  _Cox_ war voun
  Not at the bottom lyin down,
  But up aneen, as jist avore
  We zeed en floatin nigh the shore.

  But death 'ad done his wust--not âll
  Thâ did could life's last spork recall.
  Zo Doctor Cox went out o' life
  A vine, a, and as honsom mon,
  As zun hath iver shin'd upon;
  A left a family--a _wife_,
  Two _sons_--one_dater_,
  As beautiful as lovely Mâ,
  Of whom a-mâ-bi I mid za
  Zumthin hereâter:
  What thâ veel'd now I sholl not tell--
  My hort athin me 'gins to zwell!
  Reflection here mid try in vain,
  Wither particulars to gain,
  _Evans_ zim'd all like one possest;
  Imagination! tell the rest!


L'ENVOY.


  To âll that sholl theeäze storry read,
  The _Truth_ must vor it chiefly plead;
  I gee not here a tale o' ort,
  Nor snip-snap wit, nor lidden smort.
  But ôten, ôten by thie river,
  Have I a pass'd; yet niver, niver,
  Athout a thought o' _Doctor Cox_--
  His dog--his death--his floatin locks!
  The mooäst whun Brue war deep and clear,
  And Lammas dâ an harras near;--
  Whun zummer vleng'd his light abroad,--
  The zun in all his glory rawd;
  How beautiful mid be the dâ
  A zumthin âllès zim'd to zâ,
  _"Whar whing! the wâter's deep an' clear,
  But death mid be a lurkin near!"_


A  DEDICATION.


  Thenk not, bin I ood be tha fashion,
  That I, ZIR, write theäze Dedicâtion;
  I write, I haup I dwon't offend.

SOLILOQUY OF BEN BOND,

THE IDLETON.

(_First printed in the Graphic Illustrator_.)


Ben Bond was one of those sons of Idleness whom ignorance and want
of occupation in a secluded country village too often produce. He
was a comely lad, aged sixteen, employed by Farmer Tidball, a
querulous and suspicious old man, tto look after a large flock o
sheep.--The scene of his Soliloquy may be thus described.

A green sunny bank, on which the body may agreeably repose, called
the _Sea Wall_; on the sea side was an extensive common
called the _Wath_, and adjoining to it was another called the
Island, both were occasionally overflowed by the tide. On the
other side of the bank were rich enclosed pastures, suitable for
fattening the finest cattle. Into these inclosures many of Ben
Bond's charge were frequently disposed to stray. The season was
June, the time mid-day, and the western breezes came over the sea,
a short distance from which our scene lay, at once cool, grateful,
refreshing, and playful. The rushing Parret, with its ever
shifting sands, was also heard in the distance. It should
be stated, too, that Larence is the name usually given in
Somersetshire to that imaginary being which presides over the
IDLE. Perhaps it may also be useful to state here that the word
Idlelon is more than a provincialism, and should be in our
dictionaries.

During the latter part of the Soliloquy Farmer Tidball arrives
behind the bank, and hearing poor Ben's discourse with himself,
interrupts his musings in the manner described hereafter. It is
the history of an occurrence in real life, and at the place
mentioned. The writer knew Farmer Tidball personally, and has
often heard the story from his wife.

servants were not excepted. For instance:--_Creeplin Philip_,

TWO DISSERTATIONS ON SOME OF THE ANGLO-SAXON PRONOUNS.

BY JAMES JENKINGS.

(_From the Graphic Illustrator._)


No. 1.--I, IC, ICH, ICHE, UTCHY, ISE, C', CH', CHE, CH'AM, CH'UD,
CH'LL.


Until recently few writers on the English Language, have devoted
much attention to the origin of our first personal pronoun I,
concluding perhaps that it would be sufficient to state that it is
derived from the Anglo-Saxon _ic_. No pains seem to have been
taken to explain the connexion which _ic, ich,_ and
_iche_ have with _Ise, c', ch', che',_ and their
combinations in such words as _ch'am, ch'ud, ch'ill, &c_.
Hence we have been led to believe that such contractions are the
vulgar corruptions of an ignorant and, consequently, unlettered
people. That the great portion of the early Anglo-Saxons were an
unlettered people, and that the _rural_ population were
particularly unlettered, and hence for the most part ignorant, we
may readily admit; and even at the present time, many districts in
the west will be found pretty amply besprinkled with that
unlettered ignorance for which many of our forefathers were
distinguished. But an enquiry into the origin and use of our
provincial words will prove, that even our unlettered population
have been guided by certain rules in their use of an energetic
language. Hence it will be seen on inquiry that many of the words
supposed to be _vulgarisms_, and _vulgar_ and
_capricious_ contractions are no more so than many of our own
words in daily use; as to the Anglo-Saxon contractions of
_ch'am, ch'ud,_ and _ch'ill_, they will be found equally
consistent with our own common contractions of _can't, won't,
he'll, you'll, &c., &c._ in our present polished dialect.

Whether, however, our western dialects will be more dignified by
an Anglo-Saxon pedigree I do not know; those who delight in
tracing descents through a long line of ancestors up to one
primitive original ought to be pleased with the literary
genealogist, who demonstrates that many of our provincial words
and contractions have an origin more remote, and in their
estimation of course, must be more legitimate than a mere slip
from the parent stock, as our personal pronoun, I, unquestionably
is.

As to the term "barbarous," Mr. Horace Smith, the author of
"_Walter Colyton_," assures me that many of his friends call
what he has introduced of the Somerset Dialect in Walter Colyton,
"barbarous."--Now, I should like to learn in what its barbarity
consists. The plain truth after all is, that those who are
unwilling to take the trouble to understand any language, or any
dialect of any language, with which they are previously
unacquainted, generally consider such new language or such dialect
barbarous; and to them it doubtless appears so. What induces our
metropolitan _literati_, those at least who are, or affect to
be the _arbitri elegantiarum_ among them, to consider the
_Scotch_ dialect in another light? Simply because such able
writers, as _Allan Ramsay, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott,_
and others, have chosen to employ it for the expression of their
thoughts. Let similar able writers employ our _Western
Dialect_ in a similar way, and I doubt not the result. And why
should not our Western dialects be so employed? If _novelty_
and _amusement_, to say the least for such writings, be
advantageous to our literature, surely novelty and amusement might
be conveyed in the dialect of the _West_ as well as of the
_North_. Besides these advantages, it cannot be improper to
observe that occasional visits to the _well-heads_ of our
language, (and many of these will be found in the West of England)
will add to the perfection of our polished idiom itself. _The
West may be considered the last strong hold of the Anglo-Saxon in
this country._

I observed, in very early life, that some of my father's servants,
who were natives of the _Southern_ parts of the county of
Somerset, almost invariably employed the word _utchy_ for I.
Subsequent reflection convinced me that this word, _utchy_,
was the Anglo-Saxon _iche_, used as a dissyllable
_ichè_, as the Westphalians, (descendants of the Anglo-
Saxons,) down to this day in their Low German (Westphalian)
dialect say, "_Ikke_" for "_ich_." How or when this
change in the pronunciation of the word, from one to two
syllables, took place in in this country it is difficult to
determine; but on reference to the works of _Chaucer_, there
is, I think, reason to conclude that _iche_ is used sometimes
in that poet's works as a dissyllable.

Having discovered that _utchy_ was the Anglo-Saxon
_iche_, there was no difficulty in appropriating _'che,
'c',_ and _ch'_ to the same root; hence, as far as
concerned _iche_ in its literal sounds, a good deal seemed
unravelled; but how could we account for _ise_, and
_ees_, used so commonly for I in the western parts of
_Somersetshire_, as well as in _Devonshire?_ In the
first folio edition of tlie works of Shakspeare the _ch_ is
printed, in one instance, with a mark of elision before it thus,
_'ch_, a proof that the _I_ in _iche_ was sometimes
dropped in a common and rapid pronunciation; and a proof too,
that, we, the descendants of the Anglo-Saxons, have chosen the
initial letter only of that pronoun, which initial letter the
Anglo-Saxons had in very many instances discarded!

It is singular enough that Shakspeare has the _'ch_ for
_iche, I,_ and _ise_, for I, within the distance of a
few lines, in _King Lear_, Act IV. scene 6. But perhaps not
more singular than that, in Somersetshire at the present time, may
be heard for the pronoun I, _utchy_ or _ichè, 'ch,_ and
_ise_. To the absence originally of general literary
information, and to the very recent rise of the study of
grammatical analysis, are these anomalies and irregularities to be
attributed.

We see, therefore, that _'ch'ud, ch'am,_ and _'ch'ill_,
are simply the Anglo-Saxon _ich_, contracted and combined
with the respective verbs _would, am,_ and _will_; that
the _'c'_ and _'ch'_, as quoted in the lines given by
Miss Ham, are contracts for the Anglo-Saxon _iche_ or
_I_, and nothing else. It may be also observed, that in more
than one modern work containing specimens of the dialect of
Scotland and the North of England, and in, I believe, some of Sir
Walter Scott's novels, the word _ise_ is employed, so that
the auxiliary verb _will_ or _shall_ is designed to be
included in that word; and the printing or it thus, _I'se_,
indicates that it is so designed to be employed. Now, if this be a
_copy_ of the _living_ dialect of Scotland (which I beg
leave respectfully to doubt), it is a "barbarism" which the
Somerset dialect does not possess. The _ise_ in the west is
simply a pronoun and nothing else; it is, however, often
accompanied by a contracted verb, as _ise'll_ for I will.

In concluding these observations on the first personal pronoun it
may be added, that the object of the writer has been to state
facts, without the accompaniment of that _learning_ which is
by some persons deemed so essential in inquiries of this kind. The
best learning is that which conveys to us a knowledge of facts.
Should any one be disposed to convince himself of the correctness
of the _data_ here laid before him, by researches among our
old authors, as well as from living in the west, there is no doubt
as to the result to which lie must come. Perhaps, however, it may
be useful to quote one or two specimens of our more early Anglo-
Saxon, to prove their analogy to the present dialect in
Somersetshire.

The first specimen is from _Robert of Gloucester_, who lived
in the time of Henry II., that is, towards the latter end of the
twelfth century; it is quoted by _Drayton_, in the notes to
his _Pulyolbion_, song xvii.

 "The meste wo that here _vel_ bi King Henry's days,
 In this lond, _icholle_ beginne to tell _yuf ich_ may."

_Vel_, for fell, the preterite of to fall, is precisely the
sound given to the same word at the present time in Somersetshire.
We see that _icholle_, for _I shall_, follows the same
rule as the contracts _'ch'ud, 'ch'am_, and _'ch'ill_.
It is very remarkable that _sholl_, for shall, is almost
invariably employed in Somersetshire, at the present time.
_Yuf_ I am disposed to consider a corruption or mistake for
_gyf_ (give), that is, _if_, the meaning and origin of
which have been long ago settled by Horne Tooke in his Purley.

The next specimen is assuredly of a much more modern date; though
quoted by _Mr Dibdin_, in his _Metrical History of
England_, as from an _old ballad_.

  "_Ch'ill_ tell thee what, good fellow,
  Before the vriars went hence,
  A bushel of the best wheate
  Was zold for vourteen pence,
  And vorty egges a penny,
  That were both good and new,
  And this _che_ say myself have seene,
  And yet I am no Jew."


With a very few alterations, indeed, these lines would become the
_South_ Somerset of the present day.


No. II.--ER, EN, A--IT HET--THEEAZE, THEEAZAM, THIZZAM--THIC,
THILK--TWORDM--WORDN--ZINO.

There are in _Somersetshire_ (besides that particular,
portion in the _southern_ parts of the country in which the
Anglo-Saxon _iche_ or _utchy_ and its contracts prevail)
_two_ distinct and very different dialects, the boundaries of
which are strongly marked by the River _Parret_. To the east
and north of that river, and of the town of Bridgewater, a dialect
is used which is essentially, (even now) the dialect of all the
peasantry of not only that part of Somersetshire, but of
Dorsetshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Surrey,
Sussex, and Kent; and even in the suburban village of
_Lewisham_, will be found many striking remains of it. There
can be no doubt that this dialect was some centuries ago the
language of the inhabitants of all the south and of much of the
west portion of our island; but it is in its greatest
_purity_[Footnote: Among other innumerable proofs that
Somersetshire is one of the strongholds of our old Anglo-Saxon,
are the sounds which are there generally given to the vowels A and
E. A has, for the most part, the same sound as we give to that
letter in the word _father_ in our polished dialect: in the
words tâll, câll, bâll, and vâll (fall), &c., it is thus
pronounced. The E has the sound which we give in our polished
dialect to the a in pane, cane, &c., both which sounds, it may be
observed, are even _now_ given to these letters on the
Continent, in very many places, particularly in Holland and in
Germany. The name of Dr. Gall, the founder of the science of
phrenology, is pronounced Gâll, as we of the west pronounce tâll,
bâll, &c.] and most abundant in the county of Somerset. No sooner,
however, do we cross the _Parret_ and proceed from Combwich
[Footnote: Pronounced _Cummidge_. We here see the disposition
in our language to convert _wich_ into _idge_; as
_Dulwich_ and _Greenwich_ often pronounced by the vulgar
_Dullidge, Greenidge_.] to _Cannington_ (three miles
from Bridgewater) than another dialect becomes strikingly
apparent. Here we have no more of the _zees_, the
_hires_, the _veels_, and the _walks_, and a
numerous et cætera, which we find in the eastern portion of the
county, in the third person singular of the verbs, but instead we
have _he zeeth_, he sees, _he veel'th_, he feels, _he
walk'th_, he walks, and so on through the whole range of the
similar part of every verb. This is of itself a strong and
distinguishing characteristic; but this dialect has many more; one
is the very different sounds given to almost every word which is
employed, and which thus strongly characterize the persons who use
them. [Footnote: I cannot pretend to account for this very
singular and marked distinction in our western dialects; the fact,
however, is so; and it may be added, too, that there can be no
doubt both these dialects are the children of our Anglo-Saxon
parent.]

Another is that _er_ for he in the nominative case is most
commonly employed; thus for, _he said he would not_, is used
_Er zad er ood'n--Er ont goor_, for, _he will not go_,
&c.

Again _ise_ or _ees_, for I is also common. Many other
peculiarities and contractions in this dialect are to a stranger
not a little puzzling; and if we proceed so far westward as the
confines of Exmoor, they are, to a plain Englishman, very often
unintelligible. _Her_ or rather _hare_ is most always
used instead of the nominative _she_. _Har'th a dood
it_, she has done it; _Hare zad har'd do't._ She said she
would do it. This dialect pervades, not only the western portion
of Somersetshire, but the whole of Devonshire. As my observations
in these papers apply chiefly to the dialect east of the Parret,
it is not necessary to proceed further in our present course; yet
as _er_ is also occasionally used instead of _he_ in
that dialect it becomes useful to point out its different
application in the two portions of the county. In the eastern part
it is used very rarely if ever in the beginning of sentences; but
frequently thus: _A did, did er?_ He did, did he? _Wordn er
gwain?_ Was he not going? _Ool er goo?_ will he go?

We may here advert to the common corruption, I suppose I must call
it, of _a_ for _he_ used so generally in the west. As
_a zed a'd do it_ for, lie said he would do it. Shakespeare
has given this form of the pronoun in the speeches of many of his
low characters which, of course, strikingly demonstrates its then
very general use among the vulgar; but it is in his works usually
printed with a comma thus 'a, to show, probably that it is a
corrupt enunciation of he. This comma is, however, very likely an
addition by some editor.

Another form of the third personal pronoun employed only in the
objective case is found in the west, namely _en_ for him, as
_a zid en_ or, rather more commonly, _a zid'n_, he saw
him. Many cases however, occur in which _en_ is fully heard;
as _gee't to en_, give it to him. It is remarkable that
Congreve, in his comedy of "_Love for Love_" has given to
_Ben the Sailor_ in that piece many expressions found in the
west. "Thof he be my father I an't bound prentice to en." It
should be noted here that _he be_ is rarely if ever heard in
the west, but _he's_ or _he is_. _We be, you be_,
and _thâ be_ are nevertheless very common. _Er_,
employed as above, is beyond question aboriginal Saxon; _en_
has been probably adopted as being more euphonious than
_him_. [Footnote: I have not met with _en_ for him in
any of our more early writers; and I am therefore disposed to
consider it as of comparatively modern introduction, and one among
the very few changes in language introduced by the
_yeomanry_, a class of persons less disposed to changes of
any kind than any other in society, arising, doubtless, from their
isolated position. It must be admitted, nevertheless, that this
change if occasionally adopted in our polished dialect would
afford an agreeable variety by no means unmusical. In conversation
with a very learned Grecian on this subject, he seemed to consider
because the _learned_ are constantly, and sometimes very
capriciously, introducing _new_ words into our language, that
such words as _en_ might be introduced for similar reasons,
namely, mere fancy or caprice; on this subject I greatly differ
from him: our aboriginal Saxon population has never corrupted our
language nor destroyed its energetic character half so much as the
mere classical scholar. Hence the necessity, in order to a
complete knowledge of our mother tongue, that we should study the
Anglo-Saxon still found in the provinces.

_Het_ for _it_ is still also common amongst the
peasantry. In early Saxon writers, it was usually written
_hit_, sometimes _hyt_.

  "Als _hit_ in heaven y-doe,
  Evar in yearth beene it also."
  _Metrical Lord's Prayer of_ 1160.

Of _theeäze_, used as a demonstrative pronoun, both in the
singular and plural, for _this_ and _these_, it maybe
observed, as well as of the pronunciation of many other words in
the west, that we have no letters or combination of letters which,
express exactly the sounds there given to such words. Theeäze is
here marked as a dissyllable, but although it is sometimes
decidedly two syllables, its sounds are not always thus apparent
in Somerset enunciation. What is more remarkable in this world, is
its equal application to the singular and the plural. Thus we say
_theeäze man_ and _theäze men_. But in the plural are
also employed other forms of the same pronoun, namely _theeäzam,
theeäzamy_ and _thizzum_. This last word is, of course,
decidedly the Anglo-Saxon ðissum. In the west we say therefore
_theeäzam here, theeäzamy here_, and _thizzam here_ for
these, or these here; and sometimes without the pleonastic and
unnecessary _here_.

For the demonstrative _those_ of our polished dialect
_them_, or _themmy_, and often _them there_ or
_themmy there_ are the usual synonyms; as, _gee I themmy
there shoes_; that is, give me those shoes. The objective
pronoun _me_, is very sparingly employed indeed--I, in
general supplying its place as in the preceding sentence: to this
barbarism in the name of my native dialect, I must plead guilty!--
if barbarism our metropolitan critics shall be pleased to term it.
[Footnote: By the way I must just retort upon our polished
dialect, that it has gone over to the other extreme in avoidance
of the I, using me in many sentences where I ought most decidedly
to be employed. It was me [Footnote: I am aware that some of our
lexicographers have attempted a defence of this solecism by
deriving it from the French c'est moi; but, I think it is from
their affected dislike of direct egotism; and that, whenever they
can, they avoid the I in order that they might not be thought at
once vulgar and egotistic!] is constantly dinned in our ears for
it was I: as well as indeed one word more, although not a pronoun,
this is, the almost constant use in London of the verb to lay for
the verb to lie, and ketch for catch. If we at head-quarters
commit such blunders can we wonder at our provincial detachments
falling into similar errors? none certainly more gross than this!]

Thic is in the Somersetshire dialect (namely that to which I have
particularly directed my attention and which prevails on the east
side of the Parret) invariably employed for that. Thic house, that
house; thic man, that man: in the west of the county it is thiky,
or thecky. Sometimes thic has the force and meaning of a personal
pronoun, as:

  Catch and scrabble
  Thic that's yable:--
  Catch and scramble
  He who's able.

Again, thic that dont like it mid leave it,--he who does not like
it may leave it. It should be noted that th in all the pronouns
above mentioned has the obtuse sound as heard in then and this and
not the thin sound as heard in both, thin, and many other words of
our polished dialect. Chaucer employed the pronoun thic very
often, but he spells it thilk; he does not appear, however, to
have always restricted it to the meaning implied in our that and
to the present Somerset thic. Spenser has also employed thilk in
his Shepherd's Calendar several times.

"Seest not thilk same hawthorn stud How bragly it begins to bud
And utter his tender head?" "Our blonket leveries been all too sad
For thilk same season, when all is yclad With pleasance."

I cannot conclude without a few observations on three very
remarkable Somersetshire words, namely twordn, wordn, and zino.
They are living evidences of the contractions with which that
dialect very much abounds.

Twordn means it was not; and is composed of three words, namely
it, wor, and not; wor is the past tense, or, as it is sometimes
called, the preterite of the verb to be, in the third person
singular;
[Footnote: It should be observed here that was is rather
uncommon among the Somersetshire peasantry--wor, or war, being
there the synonyms; thus Spenser in his 'Shepherd's Calendar.'"

  "The kid,--
  Asked the cause of his great distress,
  And also who

  You say he was there, and I say that _a wordn_;
  You say that 'twas he, and I tell you that _twordn_;
  You ask, will he go? I reply, not as I know;
  You say _that_ he _will_, and _I_must _say, no,
    Zino_!]

and such is the indistinctness with which the sound of the vowel in
were is commonly expressed in Somersetshire, that wor, wer, or war,
will nearly alike convey it, the sound of the e being rarely if ever
long; twordn is therefore composed, as stated, of three words; but
it will be asked what business has the _d_ in it? To this it
may be replied that _d_ and _t_ are, as is well known,
often converted in our language the one into the other; but by far
the most frequently _d_ is converted into _t_. Here,
however, the
_t_ is not only converted into _d_, but instead of being
placed after _n_, as analogy requires thus, _twornt_, it
is placed before it for _euphony_ I dare say. Such is the
analysis of this singular and, if not euphonious, most certainly
expressive word.

_Wordn_ admits of a similar explanation; but this word is
composed of two words only, _war_ and _not_; instead of
_wornt_, which analogy requires, a _d_ is placed before
_n_ for a similar reason that the _d_ is placed before
_n_ in _twordn_, namely for euphony; _wordn_ is
decidedly another of the forcible words.

_Wordn fir gwain_?--was he not going, may compete with any
language for its energetic brevity.

_Zino_, has the force and application of an interjection, and
has sufficient of the _ore rotundo_ to appear a classical
dissyllable; its origin is, however, simply the contract of, _as
I know_, and it is usually preceeded in Somersetshire by
_no_. Thus, _ool er do it_? _no, zino_! _I thawt
a oodn_. Will he do it? no, as I know! I thought he would not.
These words, _Twordn_, _Wordn_, and _Zino_, may be
thus exemplified:


CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.


I cannot, perhaps, better close this work, than by presenting to
the reader the observations of Miss HAM, (a Somersetshire lady of
no mean talents), in a letter to me on these dialects.

The lines, of which I desired a copy, contain an exemplification
of the use of _utchy_ or _ichè_, used contractedly [see
UTCHY in the _Glossary_] by the inhabitants of the
_South_ of Somersetshire, one of the strongholds, as I
conceive, of the Anglo-Saxon dialect.

In our polished dialect, the lines quoted by Miss HAM, may be thus
rendered--

  Bread and cheese I have had,
  What I had I have eaten,
  More I would [have eaten if] I had [had] it.

If the contradictions be supplied they will stand thus:--

  Bread and cheese _ichè_ have a had
  That _ichè_ had _ichè_ have a eat
  More _ichè_ would _ichè_ had it.

  CLIFTON, _Jan._ 30, 1825


Sir:

I have certainly great pleasure in complying with your request,
although I fear that any communication it is in my power to make,
will be of little use to you in your curious work on the West
Country dialect. The lines you desire are these:

  Bread and cheese 'e' have a had,
  That 'e' had 'e' have a eat,
  More 'ch wou'd 'e' had it.

Sounds which, from association no doubt, carry with them to my ear
the idea of great vulgarity: but which might have a very different
effect on that of an unprejudiced hearer, when dignified by an
Anglo-Saxon pedigree. The Scotch dialect, now become _quite
classical_ with us, might, perhaps, labour under the same
disadvantage amongst those who hear it spoken by the vulgar only.

Although I am a native of Somersetshire, I have resided very
little in that county since my childhood, and, in my occasional
visits since, have had little intercourse with the
_aborigines_. I recollect, however, two or three words, which
you might not, perhaps, have met with. One of them of which I have
traditionary knowledge, being, I believe, now quite obsolete.
_Pitisanquint_ was used in reply to an inquiry after the
health of a person, and was, I understand, equivalent to _pretty
well_, or _so so_. The word _Lamiger_, which
signifies an invalid, I have no doubt you have met with. When any
one forbodes bad weather, or any disaster, it is very common to
say _Don't ye housenee_. Here you have the verbal
termination, which you remarked was so common in the West, and
which I cannot help thinking might have been originally vised as a
sort of diminutive, and that _to milkee_, signified to milk
_a little_.

As my knowledge of these few words is merely oral, I cannot answer
for the orthography; I have endeavoured to go as near the sound as
possible, and I only wish it were in my power to make some
communication more worth your attention. As it is, I have only my
best wishes to offer for the success of your truly original work.

I am, Sir, your most obedient,

Elizabeth Ham.


I have only one or two remarks to add to those of Miss Ham in the
preceding letter.

It will be seen, by reference to the exemplifications of the
dialect, that occasional _pleonasm_ will be found in it, as
well as, very often, extraordinary _contraction_. _I have
adone_, _I have a had_, are examples of the first; and
_'tword'n_, _gup_, _g'under_, _banehond_, &c.
[see Banehond in the _Glossary_] are examples of the last.
_Pitisanquint_ appears to me to be simply a contracted and
corrupted mode of expressing _Piteous_ and _quaint_,
[See Pitis in the _Glossary_.]

_Don't ye houseenee_ is _Do not stay in your houses_.
But the implied meaning is, _be active_; do your best to
provide for the bad weather which portends. In Somersetshire, most
of the colloquial and idiomatic expressions have more or less
relation to agriculture, agricultural occupations, or to the most
common concerns of life, hence such expressions have, in process
of time, become _figurative._ Thus, _don't ye housenee,_
would be readily applied to rouse a person to activity, in order
that he may prevent or obviate any approaching or portending evil.

I am still of opinion; indeed I may say, I am quite sure, that the
verbal terminations, _sewy, Tcnitty, &c.,_ have no relation
to _diminution_ in the district East of the Parret.

Upon the whole, it is evident that considerable care and
circumspection are necessary in committing to paper the signs of
the sounds of a language, of which we have no accredited examples,
nor established criterion. In making collections of this work, I
have not failed to bear this constantly in mind.
