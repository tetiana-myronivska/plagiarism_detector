  Now about the bed
  Is seen each learned head.
  The patient's pulse is felt--with graver air
  Each M.D. seats him in a chair.
  Crosses his legs--leans on his stick, mums--hahs--and hums
  Pulls out his watch--takes snuff--and twirls his thumbs.
    At length,
  The awful stillness broke--
    As if from silence gathering strength
  Most lustily they all did croak,
  Their opinions mingling,
  In discordant jingling--
  "A purge"--"a blister"--"shave his head"
  "Senna and salts"--"a clyster"--"have him bled,"
  "A pill at noon"--"another pill at night,"
  "A warm-bath, sure, would set him right."
  Thus with purges and blisters,
  Pills, bleeding, and clysters,
  The poor patient they threatened
  Should be deluged and sweatened.

  Unable to endure the riot,
  And wishing for a little quiet,
  The sickman raised his head,
  And said--
  Gentlemen, I do beseech ye, cease your pother,
  Nor any more with me your wise heads bother,
  Scratching your wigs,
  Like sapient pigs;
  Whate'er you may decide is my disease,
  I humbly do conceive a little ease
  From your infernal noise and chatter.
  With which I'm dunn'd
  And nearly stunn'd,
  Would greatly tend to mend the matter;
  And if, perforce, I must resign my breath,
  For heav'n's sake let me _die_ a NATURAL _death_.

AN AGITATOR.


M. Monchenut, an old man of eighty, afflicted with the palsy, was
arrested during the reign of terror, under suspicion of being an agitator.
Being asked what he had to say to the accusation, "Alas, gentlemen, it is
very true, I am agitated enough, God knows, for I have not been able to
keep a limb still for these fifteen years."

CHINESE POLITENESS.


There is one striking particular in which the Chinese politeness is quite
the reverse of ours. To take off their caps when they salute one another,
or even accidentally to appear uncovered, is esteemed the height of ill
breeding and indecency.
