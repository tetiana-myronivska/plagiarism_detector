63  But if any one shall again
return to his dissension; he shall
be shut out from the tower, and
shall lose his life. For the life
of those who keep the commandments
of the Lord, consists in doing
what they are commanded; not in
principality, or in any other
dignity.

64  For by forbearance and humility
of mind, men shall attain unto life;
but by seditions and contempt of the
law, they shall purchase death unto
themselves.

65  They who in their rods
had half dry and half green, are
those who are engaged in many
affairs of the world, and are not
joined to the saints. For which
cause half of them liveth, and
half is dead.

66  Wherefore many of these
since the time that they have
heard my commands, have repented,
and begun to dwell in the tower.
But some of them have
wholly fallen away; to these there
is no more place for repentance.

67  For by reason of their present
interests, they have blasphemed
and denied God: and for this
wickedness they have lost life.
And of these many are still in
doubt, yet these may return; and
if they shall quickly repent, they
shall have a place in the tower;
but if they shall be more slow,
they shall dwell within the walls;
but if they shall not repent, they
shall die.

68  As for those who had two
parts of their rods green, and the
third dry; they have by manifold
ways denied the Lord. Of these
many have repented, and found
a place in the tower: and many
have altogether departed from
God. These have utterly lost life.

69  And some being in a doubtful
state, have raise up dissensions:
these may yet return, if they
shall suddenly repent and not
continue in their lusts; but if
they shall continue in their
evil-doing they shall die.

70  They who gave in their
rods two parts dry, and the other
been, are those who have indeed
been faithful, but withal rich and
full of good things; and thereupon
have desired to be famous
among the heathen which are
without, and have thereby fallen
into great pride, and begun to
aim at high matters, and to
forsake the truth.

71  Nor were they joined to the
saints, but lived with the heathen;
and this life seemed the more pleasant
to them. Howbeit they have not
departed from God, but continued
in the faith; only they have
not wrought the works of faith.

72  Many therefore of these have
repented; and begun to dwell in
the tower. Yet others still living
among the heathen. people, and
being lifted up with their vanities,
have utterly fallen away from
God, and followed the works and
wickedness of the heathen.
These kind of men therefore are
reckoned among strangers to the
Gospel.

73 Others of these began to be
doubtful in their minds; despairing
by reason of their wicked doings
ever to attain unto salvation
Others being thus made doubtful,
did moreover stir up dissensions.

74  To these therefore, and to
those who by reason of their doings
are become doubtful, there is still
hope of return; but they must repent
quickly, that their place may be in
the tower. But they that repent not,
and continue still in their pleasures,
are nigh unto death.

75   As for those who gave in
their rods green, excepting their
tops, which only were dry, and
had clefts; these were always
good, and faithful, and upright
before God: nevertheless they
sinned a little, by reason of their
empty pleasures and trifling
thoughts which they had within
themselves.

76  Wherefore many of them
when they heard my words,
repented forthwith, and began to
dwell in the tower. Nevertheless
some grew doubtful, and others
to their doubtful minds added
dissensions. To these therefore
there is still hope of return,
because they were always good;
but they shall not hardly be moved.
