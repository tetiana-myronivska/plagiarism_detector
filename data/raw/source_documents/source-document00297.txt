MALATESTI.       Thou wretched thing of blood,
How came Antonio by his death?

BOSOLA.  In a mist; I know not how:
Such a mistake as I have often seen
In a play.  O, I am gone!
We are only like dead walls or vaulted graves,
That, ruin'd, yield no echo.  Fare you well.
It may be pain, but no harm, to me to die
In so good a quarrel.  O, this gloomy world!
In what a shadow, or deep pit of darkness,
Doth womanish and fearful mankind live!
Let worthy minds ne'er stagger in distrust
To suffer death or shame for what is just:
Mine is another voyage.
     [Dies.]

PESCARA.  The noble Delio, as I came to th' palace,
Told me of Antonio's being here, and show'd me
A pretty gentleman, his son and heir.

     [Enter DELIO, and ANTONIO'S Son]

MALATESTI.  O sir, you come too late!

DELIO.                                 I heard so, and
Was arm'd for 't, ere I came.  Let us make noble use
Of this great ruin; and join all our force
To establish this young hopeful gentleman
In 's mother's right.  These wretched eminent things
Leave no more fame behind 'em, than should one
Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow;
As soon as the sun shines, it ever melts,
Both form and matter.  I have ever thought
Nature doth nothing so great for great men
As when she 's pleas'd to make them lords of truth:
Integrity of life is fame's best friend,
Which nobly, beyond death, shall crown the end.
     Exeunt.
