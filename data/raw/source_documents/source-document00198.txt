PUNCH,

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

VOL. 100.


March 28, 1891.


THE G.P.O. CUCKOO.

[Illustration]

  It was a gallant Postmaster that armed him for the fray,
  And, oh, his eyes were gleaming as he summoned his array;
  To North and South the message went, to W. and E.,
  And where, 'mid piles of ledgers, men make money in E.C.;
  From Highgate Hill to Putney one cry the echoes wakes.
  As the Postmen don their uniforms and shout aloud for RAIKES.

  "Brave Postmen," spake an officer, who gazed upon the throng,
  "Ye tramp the streets by day and night, your hours are very long;
  Yet since you love the G.P.O. that thus your feet employs,
  We must not see you flouted by a perky pack of hoys.
  Swift rally round the Master who quavers not nor quakes,
  Our Red Knight of the Pillar-Box, the adamantine RAIKES.

  "What? 'The Public want the Messengers'? We'll teach the Public sense,
  Which consists in looking pleasant while we pocket all their pence.
  Though the papers rave, we care not for their chatter and their fuss.
  They must keep at home their messages, or send them all through Us.
  And we'll crush these boy-intruders as a mongoose crushes snakes.
  They have sown, but we shall reap it--'tis the will of Mr. RAIKES."

         *       *       *       *       *

  But _Punch_ was there, and listened, and his angry face grew red,
  Like the tape that RAIKES delights in, and he shook his ancient head,
  "RAIKES," he cried, "I doubt your wisdom, and I much incline to scorn
  Those who trespass on their neighbour's land, and cart away his corn.
  Let the man who makes the oven and laboriously bakes
  Take the profit on the loaves he sells, nor yield it all to RAIKES.

  "You say you'll do the thing yourself: Monopoly decrees
  That, if boys go making honey, they must lose it, like the bees.
  But, oh, be warned, my Postmaster, it's not a pleasant thing
  To incur a bee's resentment and to suffer from its sting:
  And (to change my humble parallel) I like not him who takes
  A nest prepared by others, like the Cuckoo-Postman RAIKES!"

       *       *       *       *       *

SOUND AND SAFE.--We hear that Mr. W.H. GRIFFITHS is to be the new
Lessee of the Shaftesbury. Years ago, to the popular inquiry, "Who's
GRIFFITHS?" there was but one answer, "The Safe Man." Good omen for
the Shaftesbury.

       *       *       *       *       *

BAR BARRED!

    SCENE--_A Parliamentary Committee Room. Committee sitting
    at horse-shoe table. Bar crowded at table covered with
    plans, custards, buns, agreements, and ginger-beer. Huge
    plans hanging to walls. View in distance of St. Thomas's
    Hospital. East-West Diddlesex Railway Extension Bill under
    consideration. Expert Witness standing at reading-desk under
    examination_.

_Junior Counsel_ (_for Promoters_). You have told us that there is a
cutting at Burnt House Mill, coloured red in plan--in your opinion
do you think that the road passing; by Hoggsborough, coloured green,
could be so diverted as to avoid the necessity of throwing a bridge
over the River Crowe, coloured yellow?

_Expert Witness_ (_with great deliberation, and illustrating his
remarks by references to a large plan_). In my opinion I think the
necessity of building a bridge over the River Crowe may be avoided
by skirting the Swashbuckler Estate, and by making a new road that
would cross the proposed line by a level crossing at Twaddlecomb, and
ultimately reach Market Goosebury, coloured blue, by following the
course of the Raisensworth, coloured black.

_Junior Counsel_. Thank you--that will do. [_Sits down._

_First Cross-Examining Q.C._ (_suddenly entering from another
Committee Room, looking for his Junior--aside_). Where on earth have
we got to?

_Chairman of Committee_. Is this witness cross-examined?

_First C.-E. Q.C._ Certainly, Sir. Now I think you say that it is
necessary to make a bridge over the River Crowe, coloured red in plan?

_Expert Witness_. No; I say that if the Swashbuckler Estate is
skirted, &c., &c. [_Repeats the answer he has already given._

_Second Cross-Examining Q.C._ (_entering hurriedly, as his learned
brother sits down_). One moment, please. Now you say that it is
absolutely necessary to pass the River Crowe, in plan coloured red,
by a bridge?

_Expert Witness_. On the contrary, I say that if the Swashbuckler
Estate, &c., &c. [_Repeats his answer for the third time._

_Third C.-E. Q.C._ (_entering hurriedly, as his predecessor resumes
his seat_). And now, Sir, that my learned friends have asked you
_their_ questions, I have to ask you _mine_. Be kind enough to say,
for the benefit of the Right Hon. Chairman and the Hon. Members
of the Committee, whether, in your opinion, in the construction
of the proposed line, where the road reaches the neighbourhood
of--(_consulting plan_)--Market Goosebury, coloured blue in the
plan, and, as you will see, runs through the--(_inspects plan
closely_)--Swashbuckler Estate--yes, the Swashbuckler Estate--and
comes, as you will see, if you refer to the chart, near
Twaddlecomb--having now sufficiently indicated the locality, I
repeat, will you be kind enough to say whether, in your opinion, the
necessity of building a bridge over the River Raven--(_is prompted by
Junior_)--I should say, over the River Crowe--could be avoided?

_Chairman of Committee_ (_interposing_). I would suggest that, as
this question has been answered three times, the witness be excused
further examination at the hands of Counsel not present at the
examination-in-chief.

_First C.-E. Q.C._ (_warmly_). I consider this an infringement of the
privileges of the Bar. The Right Hon. Chairman must remember that it
is possible that a single reference in the examination-in-chief may
only require cross-examination on the part of the Clients whom we
represent. Besides, an expert witness's examination-in-chief is very
seldom shaken, and all we can possibly want is a note taken by a
learned friend who has acted as a Junior. All of us are occasionally
wanted elsewhere.

_Second C.-E. Q.C._ (_indignantly_). Yes; and how can we attend to our
Clients' interests if we are not allowed to be in two places at once?

_Third C.-E. Q.C._ (_furiously_). You have no right to act upon an
old ruling that was never enforced. Why, such a regulation would ruin
us--and many of us have wives and children!

    [_Exeunt defiantly, to return, later on, ready to brave
    imprisonment in the Clock Tower, if necessary, N.B.--Up to
    date the Tower is untenanted._

       *       *       *       *       *

"IN THE NAME OF THE LAW--PHOTOGRAPHS!"--MR. A. BRIEFLESS, Junr.,
having received a respectful invitation from some Brook Street
Photographers to favour them (without charge) with a sitting, "to
enable them to complete their series of portraits of distinguished
legal gentlemen," regrets to say that, as he has already sat for
another Firm making the same request (see _Papers from Pump-handle
Court_), he is unable to comply with their courteous request. However,
he is pleased to hear that a similar petition has been forwarded
to others of his learned friends, one of whom writes to say, he
"possesses a wig, and the right to wear it, but that there his
connection with the Law begins and ends." Mr. A. BRIEFLESS, Junr.,
wishes the industrious Firm every success in their public-spirited
undertaking.

GOSCHEN CUM DIG.; OR, THE (FAR FROM) DYING SWAN.

(A LONG WAY AFTER LORD TENNYSON.)

[Illustration: "WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS RECESS IS ITS PERFECT QUIET!"]

    "Were I to go further into detail, I should show you that the
    floodgates of (financial) abuse have been opened even to a
    much larger extent than I have described. We are getting into
    a system under which Parliament is treated, and the country is
    treated, to the exhibition of fictitious surpluses of revenue
    over expenditure."--_Mr. Gladstone (at Hastings) on Mr.
    Goschen's Finance._

  I.

  The backwater was snug and fair,
  And the gay Canoeist cavorted there.
  Thinks he, "I have built up everywhere
    A reputation for pluck and stay!"
  Amidst the reeds the river ran;
  Behind them floated a Grand Old Swan,
        And loudly did lament
    The better deeds of a better day;
  Ever the gray Canoeist went on,
    Making his memos. as he went.

  II.

  "My foes are piqued, I must suppose,
  But cannot see their way to a 'Cry.'"
    (So mused the man with the Semite nose,
        As up the backwater he swept.)
  "What I like" (said he) "in this nook so shy,
  Is that I am quiet, and free as a swallow,
  Squaring accounts at my own sweet will.
  With never a fear of the Big Swan's Bill!
  The Swan's as quiet as though he slept.
  I fancy I've funked the fierce old fellow!"

  III.

  The Grand Old Swan came out of his hole,
  Snorting with furious joy.
  Hidden by rushes he yet drew near,
  Behind the Canoeist, until on his ear
  Those snortings fell, both full and clear.
  Floating about the backwater shy,
  Stronger and stronger the shindy stole,
  Filling the startled Canoeist with fear;
  And the jubilant jobating voice,
  With menaces meaning and manifold,
  Flowed forth on a "snorter" clear and bold
  (As when a party-procession rejoice
  With drums, and trumpets, and with banners of gold),
  Until the Canoeist's blood ran cold,
  And over his paddle he crouched and rolled;
  And he wished himself from that nook afar
  (If it were but reading the evening star):
  And the Swan he ruffled his plumes and hissed,
  And with sounding buffets, which seldom missed,
  He walloped into that paddler gay
  (Bent on enjoying his holiday).
  He smote him here, and he spanked him there,
  Upset his "balance," rumpled his hair.
  "I'll teach you," he cried, with pounding pinions,
  "To come intruding in _my_ dominions!"
  And the frightened flags, and the startled reeds,
  And the willow-branches hoar and dank,
  And the shaking rushes and wobbling weeds,
  And the wave-worn horns of the echoing bank,
  And the Grand Old Swan's admiring throng
  (Who yelled at seeing him going so strong)
  Were flooded and fluttered by that Stentor song!

       *       *       *       *       *

THE PROPOSED OLD ETONIAN BANQUET.--"_Floreat Etona!_" by all means,
and may "HENRY's holy shade" never be less! But doesn't it seem rather
like a contradiction in terms, for Old Etonians to sit down to an
Eaten Dinner?--Yours, once removed,

A SIXTH-FORMOSUS PUER.

ABOUT THE COURT.

At the Royal Court Theatre, which, as I read on the illustrated
House Programme, is "Licensed by the London County Council to the
Proprietors, Mrs. JOHN WOOD and Mr. A. CHUDLEIGH,"--is the LORD
CHAMBERLAIN out of it in this quarter? (how can there be a Court
without a Lord Chamberlain?), and, "under which king, Bezonian?" Was
it in the days of _The Happy Land?_--but no matter. To resume. At the
aforesaid Court Theatre is now being performed an original Farce,
in Three Acts, written by Mr. R.R. LUMLEY. Ah! Ah! LUMLEY, this
isn't quite up to your other piece, _Aunt Jack._ Mrs. JOHN WOOD
is invaluable, and keeps the game alive throughout; while ARTHUR
CECIL's _Duke of Donoway_--not a Comedy Duke, but a Duke in farcical
circumstances--is excellent. WEEDON GROSSMITH is funny, but in
make-up, tone of voice, and mannerisms, the part seems mixed up with
one or two others that he has played, and is very far from being in
the same category with _Aunt Jack's_ crushed Solicitor. BRANDON THOMAS
as _Captain Roland Gurney, R.N._, is very natural. _The Office Boy_
of Master WILSON and the little _Gridd_ of Master WESTGATE (very near
Birchington when the boy is in Mrs. WOOD's hands), are capital. Miss
CARLOTTA LECLERCQ's _Duchess_ is equal to the occasion. The two girls'
parts are unnatural and uninteresting. What ought to make the success
of the piece is the scene where WEEDON GROSSMITH volunteers to sing
"_The Wolf_," and everyone talks and chatters until the Babel ends
in an explosion. It convulses the house with laughter; and if this
situation had been so contrived,--as it might have been, allow me
to say,--as to end the Act, the Curtain falling on the climax, the
dashing down of the enraged musician's song and the exit of the
Duke, the run of _The Volcano_ would have been insured from now to
Christmas. Is it too late to retrieve this? To quote the title of
one of ANTHONY TROLLOPE's novels, "I say No!" There is so much that
is genuinely funny in the piece, that if the alteration is done
with a will, _hic et nunc_, why within a week the piece could be
fixed securely in its place for the London season, and beyond it.
Let funny little WEEDON reconsider his make-up, and come out as
the flaxen-headed M.P. of a Saxon constituency. And a word in his
ear,--SOTHERN fashioned _Lord Dundreary_ out of a worse part than
this. _The Volcano_ shouldn't "bust up." That's my opinion, as

A FRIEND AT COURT.

A SCHOOL OF CRITICISM.

From the _Queen_. A Correspondent writes:--

"JOURNALISM.--I want to become a Dramatic Critic; how should I begin?
I am fond of going to the theatre, but find it difficult to remember
the plot of the play afterwards. What kind of notices do Editors
prefer?--_Histrionica_."

Isn't it Mr. DAVID ANDERSON who has set up a flourishing School for
Journalists? Why shouldn't there be a School for Critics? The Master
would take his pupils to the Theatre regularly, and could lecture on
the Play as it proceeded. Should Managers and Actors be so blind to
the best interests of their Art as to refuse to allow the play to be
stopped from time to time to allow of the Instructor's remarks, then
he would have to wait until after each Act, and retire with his pupils
into some quiet corner of the Refreshment-room, where he could give
his lecture. Or teacher and pupils could hear a Scene or an Act every
night,--and if they paid for their places (a reduction being made
for a quantity), the particular drama they patronised would be
considerably benefited by this plan.

There might be a uniform or an academic costume for these critical
scholars--say Shakspearian collars, Undergraduate gown, and portable
mortar-board, to fold up, and be sat upon. There might be a row
reserved for them at the back of the Dress Circle, and twenty-five
per cent. reduction on tickets for a series. The M.C., or Master of
Critics, would take a fee for a course from each pupil. Fee to include
seat at theatre, instruction, _and supper afterwards_.

       *       *       *       *       *

IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,--"Hallo!"
being the recognised telephonic summons in use between companies
and individuals of all nationalities, may be already considered as
"Hallo'd by a variety of associations."

MR. PUNCH'S POCKET IBSEN.

(_CONDENSED AND REVISED VERSION BY MR. P.'S OWN HARMLESS IBSENITE._)

NO. I.--ROSMERSHÖLM (CONCLUDED.)

ACT III.

    _Sitting-room at Rosmershölm. Sun shining outside in the
    Garden. Inside REBECCA WEST is watering a geranium with
    a small watering-pot. Her crochet antimacassar lies in
    the arm-chair. Madam HELSETH is rubbing the chairs with
    furniture-polish from a large bottle. Enter ROSMER, with his
    hat and stick in his hand. Madam HELSETH corks the bottle
    and goes out to the right._

_Rebecca_. Good morning, dear. (_A moment after--crocheting._) Have
you seen Rector KROLL's paper this morning? There's something about
_you_ in it.

_Rosmer_. Oh, indeed? (_Puts down hat and stick, and takes up paper._)
H'm! (_Reads--then walks about the room._) KROLL _has_ made it hot for
me. (_Reads some more._) Oh, this is _too_ bad! REBECCA, they _do_ say
such nasty spiteful things! They actually call me a renegade--and I
can't _think_ why! They _mustn't_ go on like this. All that is good in
human nature will go to ruin if they're allowed to attack an excellent
man like me! Only think, if I can make them see how unkind they have
been!

_Reb._ Yes, dear, in that you have a great and glorious object to
attain--and I wish you may get it!

_Rosmer_. Thanks. I think I shall. (_Happens to look through window,
and jumps._) Ah, no, I shan't--never now. I have just seen--

[Illustration]

_Reb._ _Not_ the White Horse, dear? We must really not overdo that
White Horse!

_Rosmer_. No--the mill-race, where BEATA--(_Puts on his hat--takes it
off again._) I'm beginning to be haunted by--no, I _don't_ mean the
horse--by a terrible suspicion that BEATA may have been right after
all! Yes, I do believe, now I come to think of it, that I must really
have been in love with you from the first. Tell me _your_ opinion.

_Reb._ (_struggling with herself, and still crocheting._) Oh--I can't
exactly say--such an odd question to ask me!

_Rosmer_ (_shakes his head_). Perhaps; I have no sense of humour--no
respectable Norwegian _has_--and I _do_ want to know--because, you
see, if I _was_ in love with you, it was a _sin_, and if I once
convinced myself of that--

    [_Wanders across the room._

_Reb._ (_breaking out_). Oh, these old ancestral prejudices! Here is
your hat, and your stick, too; go and take a walk.

    [ROSMER takes hat and stick, first, then goes out and takes
    a walk; presently Madam HELSETH appears, and tells REBECCA
    something. REBECCA tells _her_ something. They whisper
    together. Madam H. nods, and shows in Rector KROLL, who
    keeps his hat in his hand, and sits on a chair._

_Kroll_. I merely called for the purpose of informing you that I
consider you an artful and designing person, but that, on the whole,
considering your birth and moral antecedents, you know--(_nods at
her_)--it is not surprising. (_REBECCA walks about, wringing her
hands_) Why, what _is_ the matter? Did you really not know that you
had no right to your father's name? I'd no _idea_ you would mind my
mentioning such a trifle!

_Reb._ (_breaking out_). I _do_ mind. I am an emancipated enigma,
but I retain a few little prejudices still. I _don't_ like owning
to my real age, and I _do_ prefer to be legitimate. And, after your
information--of which I was quite ignorant, as my mother, the late
Mrs. GAMVIK, never _once_ alluded to it--I feel I must confess
everything. Strong-minded advanced women are like that. Here is
ROSMER. (ROSMER _enters with his hat and stick._) ROSMER, I want to
tell you and Rector KROLL a little story. Let us sit down, dear,
all three of us. (_They sit down, mechanically, on chairs._) A long
time ago, before the play began--(_in a voice scarcely audible_)--in
Ibsenite dramas, all the interesting things somehow _do_ happen before
the play begins--

_Rosmer_. But, REBECCA, I _know_ all this. KROLL--(_looks hard at
her_). Perhaps I had better go?

_Reb._ No--I will be short--this was it. I wanted to take my share
in the life of the New Era, and march onward with ROSMER. There
was one dismal, insurmountable barrier--(_to ROSMER, who nods
gravely_)--BEATA! I understood where your deliverance lay--and I
acted. _I_ drove BEATA into the mill-race ... There!

_Rosmer_ (_after a short silence_). H'm! Well, KROLL--(_takes up his
hat_)--if you're thinking of walking home, I'll go too. I'm going to
be orthodox once more--after _this_!

_Kroll_ (_severely and impressively, to_ REB.). A nice sort of young
woman _you_ are! [_Both go out hastily, without looking at REB._

_Reb._ (_speaks to herself, under her breath_). Now I _have_ done it.
I wonder _why_. (_Pulls bell-rope._) Madam HELSETH, I have just had a
glimpse of two rushing White Horses. Bring down my hair-trunk.

    [_Enter Madam H., with large hair-trunk, as Curtain falls._

ACT IV.

    _Late evening. REBECCA WEST stands by a lighted lamp, with a
    shade over it, packing sandwiches, &c., in a reticule, with a
    faint smile. The antimacassar is on the sofa. Enter ROSMER._

_Rosmer_ (_seeing the sandwiches, &c._). Sandwiches? Then you _are_
going I Why, on earth,--I _can't_ understand!

_Reb._ Dear, you never _can_. Rosmershölm is too much for me. But how
did you get on with KROLL?

_Rosmer_. We have made it up. He has convinced me that the work of
ennobling men was several sizes too large for me--so I am going to let
it alone--

_Reb._ (_with her faint smile_). There I almost think, dear, that you
are wise.

_Rosmer_ (_as if annoyed_). What, so _you_ don't believe in me either,
REBECCA--you never _did! [Sits listlessly on chair._

_Reb._ Not much, dear, when you are left to yourself--but I've another
confession to make.

_Rosmer_. What, _another_? I really can't stand any more confessions
just now!

_Reb._ (_sitting close to him_). It is only a little one. I bullied
BEATA into the mill-race--because of a wild uncontrollable-- (_ROSMER
moves uneasily._) Sit still, dear--uncontrollable fancy--for _you_!

_Rosmer_ (_goes and sits on sofa_). Oh, my goodness, REBECCA--you
_mustn't_, you know!

    [_He jumps up and down as if embarrassed._

_Reb._ Don't be alarmed, dear, it is all over now. After living alone
with you in solitude, when you showed me all your thoughts without
reserve,--little by little, somehow the fancy passed off. I caught
the ROSMER view of life badly, and dulness descended on my soul as an
extinguisher upon one of our Northern dips. The ROSMER view of life is
ennobling, very--but hardly lively. And I've more yet to tell you.

_Rosmer_ (_turning it off_). Isn't that enough for one evening P

_Reb._ (_almost voiceless_). No, dear. I have a Past--_behind_ me!

_Rosmer_. _Behind_ you? How strange. I had an idea of that sort
already. (_Starts, as if in fear._) A joke! (_Sadly._) Ah, no--_no_,
I must not give way to _that_! Never mind the Past, REBECCA; I
once thought that I had made the grand discovery that, if one is
only virtuous, one will be happy. I see now it was too daring, too
original--an immature dream. What bothers me is that I can't--somehow
I _can't_--believe entirely in you--I am not even sure that I _have_
ennobled you so very much--_isn't_ it terrible?

_Reb._ (_wringing her hands_). Oh, this killing doubt! (_Looks darkly
at him._) Is there anything _I_ can do to convince you?

_Rosmer_ (_as if impelled to speak against his will_). Yes, one
thing--only I'm afraid you wouldn't see it in the same light. And
yet I must mention it. It is like this. I want to recover faith in
my mission, in my power to ennoble human souls. And, as a logical
thinker, this I cannot do now, unless--well, unless you jump into the
mill-race, too, like BEATA!

_Reb._ (_takes up her antimacassar, with composure, and puts it on her
head_). Anything to oblige you.

_Rosmer_ (_springs up_). What? You really _will_! You are _sure_ you
don't mind? Then, REBECCA, I will go further. I will even go--yes--as
far as you go yourself!

_Reb._ (_bows her head towards his breast_). You will see me off?
Thanks. Now you are indeed an Ibsenite.

    [_Smiles almost imperceptibly._

_Rosmer_ (_cautiously_). I said as far as _you_ go. I don't commit
myself further than that. Shall we go?

_Reb._ First tell me this. Are _you_ going with _me_, or am _I_ going
with _you_?

_Rosmer_. A subtle psychological point--but we have not time to think
it out here. We will discuss it as we go along. Come!

    [_ROSMER takes his hat and stick, REBECCA her reticule, with
    sandwiches. They go out hand-in-hand through the door, which
    they leave open. The room (as is not uncommon with rooms in
    Norway) is left empty. Then Madam HELSETH enters through
    another door._

_Madam H._ The cab, Miss--not here! (_Looks out._) Out together--at
this time of night--upon my--_not_ on the garden-seat? (_Looks out of
window._) My goodness! _what_ is that white thing on the bridge--the
_Horse_ at last! (_Shrieks aloud._) And those two sinful creatures
running home!

    _Enter ROSMER and REBECCA, _out of breath._

_Rosmer_ (_scarcely able to get the words out_). It's no use,
REBECCA--we must put it off till another evening. We can't be expected
to jump off a footbridge which already has a White Horse on it. And,
if it comes to that, why should we jump at all? I know now that I
really _have_ ennobled you, which was all _I_ wanted. What would
be the good of recovering faith in my mission at the bottom of a
mill-pond? No, REBECCA--(_lays his hand on her head_)--there is no
judge over us, and therefore--

_Reb._ (_interrupting gravely_). We will bind ourselves over in our
own recognisances to come up for judgment when called upon.

    [_Madam HELSETH holds on to a chair-back, REBECCA finishes
    the antimacassar calmly as Curtain falls._

A GRAND OLD WETTERUN!

I ain't bin werry well lately, and, to crown the hole, I was cort in
the Lizzard, I think, as they called it, on that awful Munday nite,
and that was pretty nearly a settler for both my old bones and my
breth, and might ha' bin quite so, if one of the werry kindest Members
of the old Copperashun as I nos on, who had bin a dining with a
jolly party on 'em, hadn't kindly directed my notise to about a harf
bottle-full of werry fine old Port, with the remarkabel kind words,
"That's just about what you wants, Mr. ROBERT, to take you ome safely
this most orful nite!" And so it were, and I didn't waste a single
drop on it.

[Illustration: The "Tipper's" Strike.]

However, I was obligated to have a good long rest, which I took out
mostly in sleep; but, jest as I was preparing to set out for the
"Grand Hotel," in comes my Son; and he says to me, "Guvnor," says
he--I notise as he allers calls me Guvnor when he wants me to do
sumthink--"I wants you to do me the favour to ask _Mr. Punch_ for
to do you a favour." "Why, what do you mean?" says I. "Why, this is
what I means," says he. "About the grandest feller as ewer in the
hole world gave up fifty years of his useful life to trying to make
hundreds of stupid boys into clever boys, and hundreds of bad boys
into good boys, and hundreds of dull boys into witty boys, is a going
for to have a testymonial given him by sum of them hundreds of boys,
me among 'em, to sellybrate his Jewbilly, same as the QUEEN had the
other day. Ewery one of us as lives in London will jump at the chance;
but the boys as he turns out from the great City of Lundon Skool is
such reel fust-raters, that they gits snapped up direckly by Merchants
and peeple, and sent all over the werld for to manidge their warious
buzzinesses there, so we don't know how to get at 'em; but as _Mr.
Punch_ goes wherever any smart, clever English chap goes, if he wood
most kindly let this littel matter be mentioned, the grandest, and
sucksessfullest, ay, and wittiest Skool Master of modern times wood
get his dew reward."

So says my Sun, and prowd I was to lissen to his words; and this is
what I can add to them from my own knowlidg. There's sum of the old
boys, as isn't quite as yung as when they left Skool, as has formed a
club to dine together sumtimes, and tork of old times, like senserbel
fellers as they is; and Mr. JOSEPH HARRIS, the gennelman in question,
is allers there, and allers has to make a speech, and I am amost
allers there too; and, to hear the joyful shouts of arty welcome with
which his old pupils greets him when he rises for to speak, and their
roars of larfter at his wit, and his fun, and his good-humer, while he
is a speaking, is so wery remarkabel, that I sumtimes wanders whether
it doesn't, a good deal of it, rise from the fact of his great School
being so close to _Mr. Punch's_ own horfice. But this is over the way,
as the great writer says. May I be alowd to had that my speshal frend,
and hewerybody's speshal frend, Mr. COOKE, is reddy to receive any
number of subskripshuns at 30, New Bridge Street, E.C.

THE JOLLY YOUNG WATERMAN.

(_LATEST VERSION; SUGGESTED BY A CASE AT THE LONDON SESSIONS._)

  And did you not hear of a jolly young Waterman,
    Who on the river his wherry did ply?
  When rowing along with great skill and dexterity,
    A Cask of Madeira it caught his pleased eye.
  It looked so nice, he rowed up steadily,
  Transferred that cask to his boat right readily;
  And he eyed the dear drink with so eager an air,
  For the name on the cask not a jot did he care.

  When smart EDDARD SAILL got that cask in his wherry,
    He cleaned it out--partly--with swiggings not small,
  And with his companions--what wonder?--made merry;
    Madeira's a wine that's not tippled by all.
  One fancies one hears 'em a laughing and cheering,
  Says EDDARD, "My boys, this is better than beering!
  A Waterman's life would be free from all care
  If he often dropped on treasure trove like that there."

  And yet but to think now how strangely things happen!
    They copped him for "larceny by finding,"--that's all!
  But SAILL couldn't read, and the jury was kindly,
    So EDDARD got off, though his chance appeared small.
  Now would this young Waterman keep out of sorrow,
  No derelict casks let him--shall we say, borrow?
  Madeira is nice, but you'd best have a care,
  Before swigging the wine, that it's yours fair and square!
