**_Empidonax fulvifrons pygmaeus_ Coues.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,
and Moore (1957:95) listed this subspecies of the Buff-breasted
Flycatcher from the Sierra Guadalupe on April 21. This record
represents the eastern limit of the range of _E. f. pygmaeus_ in
northeastern México.

**_Contopus pertinax pertinax_ Cabanis and Heine.--Burleigh and Lowery
(1942:194) obtained one female Coues' Flycatcher "in a small gully just
below the summit of Diamante Pass."

_Contopus virens_ (Linnaeus).--I judge from the paucity of records in
the literature that the Eastern Wood Pewee is uncommon in Coahuila.
Burleigh and Lowery (1942:194) obtained two males at the Chorro del
Agua, and remarked also that "it is possible that as far west as
Saltillo, this species is a rather uncommon transient." Ridgway
(1907:519) listed _Contopus virens_ from Sabinas.

*_Contopus sordidulus veliei_ Coues.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:
[Male] 31467 from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May
14, 1954; and [Male] 31653 from the north foot of Sierra Guadalupe (=10
mi. S, 5 mi. W General Cepeda), 6400 ft., April 19, 1953.

Specimen No. 31467 of the Western Wood Pewee was obtained in pine and
oak vegetation by Dickerman. Ridgway (1907:523) reported _Contopus
sordidulus veliei_, under the name _Myiochanes richardsonii
richardsonii_, from Sierra Encarnación. Amadon and Phillips (1947:578)
obtained a specimen of _C. sordidulus_ from Las Delicias. Miller,
Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:83) remarked that the Western Wood
Pewee breeds in the State.

_Nuttallornis borealis_ (Swainson).--Several records of the Olive-sided
Flycatcher from Coahuila are present in the literature. Miller
(1955a:167) reported it as a migrant in the desert at the base of the
Sierra del Carmen on April 24. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore
(1957:82) reported this species from Ocampo on June 16. Amadon and
Phillips (1947:578) obtained one at Las Delicias on August 16. Burleigh
and Lowery (1942:194) collected two males "near the summit of Diamante
Pass" on April 14.

*_Pyrocephalus rubinus mexicanus_ Sclater.--_Specimens examined:_ total
3: [Male] 32060 and [Female] 32061 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jiménez, 850
ft., June 19, 1952; and sex ? 32062 from 2 mi. W Jiménez, 850 ft., June
20, 1952.

The Vermilion Flycatcher is common in Coahuila. Except in the
northwestern part of the State, the subspecies _mexicanus_ is present
throughout Coahuila. The size of No. 32060 (wing, 80 mm.; tail, 62 mm.)
suggests that the specimen is an intergrade between _P. r. flammeus_
and _mexicanus_. _P. r. flammeus_ and _mexicanus_ seem to intergrade in
northern Coahuila.

Burleigh and Lowery (1942:195) found _mexicanus_ to be "quite plentiful
on the plains surrounding Saltillo." Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:33)
noted the Vermilion Flycatcher "near San Pedro." Cory and Hellmayr
(1927:92) listed _P. r. mexicanus_ from Sabinas. The size of the testes
(6×4 mm. long) of No. 32060 and the dates (June 19 and 20) on which our
specimens were collected indicate breeding.

_Pyrocephalus rubinus flammeus_ van Rossem.--This subspecies of
Vermilion Flycatcher occupies the northwestern section of Coahuila.
Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287) took a specimen of _P. r. flammeus_
"near Santo Domingo, east of the Del Carmens...." Miller (1955a:167)
re-examined this specimen and stated that "its affinity with the
northwest race of the species seems correct in terms of the characters
outlined by van Rossem (1934:353)."

_Eremophila alpestris enthymia_ (Oberholser).--Miller, Friedmann,
Griscom, and Moore (1957:105) recorded this subspecies of Horned Lark
wintering 4 mi. S Hipólito (November 2 to February 24). They reported
also that _E. a. enthymia_ breeds in Coahuila (4 mi. S Hipólito ?).
