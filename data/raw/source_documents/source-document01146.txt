Mr. Grey's opposition to Mr. Pitt's measures continued unabated for many
years, while he remained equally steady in his attachment to Mr. Fox. His
bitter hostility to the union between Ireland and England may be said to
have produced one of his most celebrated speeches. Neither was he dazzled,
nor misled by the splendid talents of Burke, at this time in highest
repute. When Mr. Fox was deserted by Lords Fitzwilliam, Carlisle, and
other alarmists, Mr. Grey unchangingly adhered to him; and when Mr. Fox
and Lord Grenville formed a Whig ministry, in 1806, Mr. Grey, then, by his
father's elevation to the peerage, become Lord Howick, was appointed First
Lord of the Admiralty, and one of the Cabinet Council. He next succeeded
Mr. Fox as Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and leader in the House of
Commons. This ministry was ill-formed, and wanted unity of purpose: their
abolition of the Slave Trade was a redeeming measure, in which Lord Howick
bore a conspicuous part; but his lordship's motion for the emancipation of
the Catholics brought about his dismissal from the ministry.

Lord Howick, soon after, by the death of his father, succeeded to the
title of Earl Grey; and by the death of his uncle, Sir Henry Grey, to the
family estate. Ill health, for a time, kept his lordship from public life:
he retired with no place but that of a Governor of the Charter House, and
without pension or sinecure. Upon the resignation of the Duke of Portland,
in 1809, his successor, Mr. Perceval, proposed a coalition with Lords
Grenville and Grey, which was at once rejected by the latter. In the
following year, his lordship "felt it his duty to arraign and to expose
the gross mismanagement of the government, and their repeated and
dangerous misconduct," in Parliament. In the same session, he charged the
lord chancellor (Eldon) with a crime little short of treason, in having
set the great seal, in 1801 and 1804, to commissions for giving the royal
assent to several bills, whilst the King was in a state of mental
infirmity, under medical care, and subject to personal control. The motion
was negatived by a majority of 189 to 64; "but Lord Eldon has not
forgotten the accusation, or forgiven the mover."[4] In 1812, another
attempt was made to bring Lord Grey, with Lord Grenville, into the cabinet;
but this was rejected as promptly as before.

        1831.

Lord Grey again retired to private life. In 1817, his lordship reappeared,
and moved an amendment to the parliamentary address to the throne, urging
rigid economy, retrenchment, and an inquiry into the state of the nation.
In the same year he brought before the House of Lords, the notable
circular of Lord Sidmouth for the prosecution of libels by magistrates.
"It is a singular fact," observes an acute historical writer,[5] "that
Lord Grey, on this occasion, made an able and erudite law argument; which
all the law lords, including Lord Ellenborough, made vain efforts to
refute; and which Lord Ellenborough had the manliness to eulogize;"
notwithstanding which Lord Grey's motion for a copy of the opinion of the
law officers of the crown was negatived.

During the trial of Queen Caroline, the wisdom-tempered zeal of Lord Grey
ranked him amongst the most efficient, as he was the most eloquent, of her
defenders: his lordship, in conjunction with Lord King, also made
successive attempts, by motions, to quash the investigation.

To the administration of the Earl of Liverpool, it need scarcely be added,
Earl Grey was thoroughly hostile: his aversion to the policy of Mr.
Canning was equally decided; and the same independent spirit urged him to
oppose the measures of the Wellington cabinet, except the memorable
measure of Catholic Emancipation, by the proposal of which he had lost
office in the year 1810. His lordship's eloquent efforts in this cause
must be alive in the recollection of the reader.

We are now fast approaching the consummation of one of the grand objects
of his lordship's political life. By the dissolution of the Wellington
cabinet, in 1830, Lord Grey became at the head of the present
administration. His first act was the introduction of the grand measure
for parliamentary reform, which, for sixteen months past, has interested
the whole population of this mighty empire. His lordship's emphatic
expressions, on this occasion, are "familiar as household words." "He made
it a condition on accepting office, that Parliamentary Reform should be
introduced as a government measure. That condition having been assented to
by his most gracious sovereign, by this measure he was prepared to stand
or fall." Gratifying as would be the task, we need not detail the
incidents of the last few months of his lordship's career. Our eulogium
would be poor indeed, while nine-tenths of the journals of our country are
perpetuating his good deeds; while his political integrity has become
exemplary to every cabinet in Europe; and millions are about to burst
forth in "the loud festivity of mirth" to celebrate the virtue of their
popular minister.

Earl Grey married in 1794, Mary Elizabeth Brabazon, daughter of Lord
Ponsonby, by whom his lordship has had a numerous family: the eldest son
and heir apparent being Viscount Howick, born in 1802. In our outline of
Lord Grey's public life, the reader may have observed his Lordship's
fondness for the retirement of the domestic circle. This accords with his
recent declaration in parliament: "he was fond of retirement, and in
domestic life he lived happy in the bosom of his family. Nothing could
have tempted him to embark on these stormy seas--

  Bankrupt of life, but prodigal of ease--

nothing but an overpowering sense of the duty which he owed to his
country." Even apart from political distinction, Earl Grey must be
considered happy indeed; but honoured in public and cherished in private
life, his pre-eminence is proud indeed. Shakspeare tells of the "divinity"
that "doth hedge a king:" yet who would enjoy more than the consciousness
of having been true to his sovereign, his country, and his honour.
