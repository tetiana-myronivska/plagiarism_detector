Unknown to History

A Story of the Captivity of Mary of Scotland

By Charlotte M Yonge.


PREFACE.


In p. 58 of vol. ii. of the second edition of Miss Strickland's Life
of Mary Queen of Scots, or p. 100, vol. v. of Burton's History of
Scotland, will be found the report on which this tale is founded.

If circumstances regarding the Queen's captivity and Babington's plot
have been found to be omitted, as well as many interesting personages
in the suite of the captive Queen, it must be remembered that the art
of the story-teller makes it needful to curtail some of the incidents
which would render the narrative too complicated to be interesting to
those who wish more for a view of noted characters in remarkable
situations, than for a minute and accurate sifting of facts and
evidence.

                                               C. M. YONGE.

February 27, 1882.

UNKNOWN TO HISTORY.


Poor scape-goat of crimes, where,--her part what it may,
So tortured, so hunted to die,
Foul age of deceit and of hate,--on her head
Least stains of gore-guiltiness lie;
To the hearts of the just her blood from the dust
Not in vain for mercy will cry.

Poor scape-goat of nations and faiths in their strife
So cruel,--and thou so fair!
Poor girl!--so, best, in her misery named,--
Discrown'd of two kingdoms, and bare;
Not first nor last on this one was cast
The burden that others should share.
                 Visions of England, by F. T. Palgrave


CHAPTER I. THE LITTLE WAIF.
