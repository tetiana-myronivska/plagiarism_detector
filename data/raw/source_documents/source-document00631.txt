    Brand's learned correspondent was, doubtless, the late Mr.
    Douce, from whom the writer of this Note has often heard the
    same illustration.]


_Lady Norton_ (Vol. ii., p. 480.).--An account of lady Norton may be
seen in _Memoirs of several ladies of Great Britain, who have been
celebrated for their writings or skill in the learned languages arts
and sciences_. By George Ballard. Oxford, 1752. 4º. She is said to
have written two books, viz.: _The applause of virtue. In four parts._
etc. London, 1705. 4º. pp. 262; and _Memento mori: or meditations on
death_. London 1705. 4º. pp. 108. She was living in advanced years,
about 1720.

The same biographical repertory contains an account of her daughter,
lady Gethin--of whom some particulars were given by myself in a small
volume of essays printed for private circulation, under the title of
_Curiosities of literature illustrated_, in 1837. On that occasion
I ventured to express my belief that lady Gethin did not compose one
sentence of the _remains_ ascribed to her; but I hope the claims of
lady Norton to _patristic learning_ may more successfully bear the
test of critical examination.

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

Honour to the University of Oxford, Honour to the Rev. Josiah
Forshall, and though last not least, Honour to the learned Keeper
of the Manuscripts in the British Museum, Sir Frederick Madden, for
giving us _The Holy Bible containing the Old and New Testaments with
the Apocryphal Books, in the earliest English versions made from the
Latin Vulgate, by John Wycliffe and his followers_. Never did the
University Press put forth a more valuable or more important work
than these four handsome quartos, (published, too, at the marvellously
small price of five guineas), in which are now printed, for the first
time, in an entire form, those Versions which may be regarded as
the earliest in the English language which embrace any considerable
proportion of the Holy Scriptures. By this publication, Oxford has
done her part towards wiping away the disgrace which has so long
attached to this country--which boasts, and justly and proudly boasts,
of being _the_ country of Bibles--for its long-continued neglect of
these early versions of the vernacular Scriptures. How great was
the influence which they exercised upon the religious opinions and
sentiments of the nation at large in the interval between the years
1382 and 1526, how great an amount of scriptural truth they diffused,
how effectually they supplied the opponents of the Papal system with
the means of exposing its abuses and errors, and how they thereby
laid a deep foundation for the reform of the sixteenth century, may be
clearly seen by a perusal of the Preface to this great work; on which
the learned editors have employed their learning and industry for two
and twenty years, to their own high credit, and to the vindication
of English scholarship. But our limited space will not admit of
our detailing all the claims which this _editio princeps_ of the
_Wycliffite Scriptures_ has upon the attention of our readers, or of
pointing out all the great services which its editors have rendered
to the literary, no less than to the religious world. When we state
briefly that in the work before us we have the _two_ versions, the
_earlier_ and _later_ versions, printed side by side; that these
are accompanied by various readings gathered from the collection of
upwards of one hundred different manuscripts; introduced by a preface
full of new and most interesting particulars of this first attempt to
give to this country the Scriptures in a tongue "understanded of the
people;" and the whole rendered complete by an extensive and most
valuable glossary, we feel persuaded our readers will agree with us in
giving honour to all who have had hand or heart in the production of
these deeply interesting volumes.

Notices to Correspondents.

Our Christmas Number. _This week our able contemporary_, Household
Words, _treats his readers to a Christmas Number. It is one of the
many good things in which our popular friend has anticipated us.
Thanks, however, to the Peace Congress, we are content to be thus
anticipated without giving utterance to the time-honoured_ "Pereant
qui ante nos nostra dixerunt." _Still, as we earnestly desire to
close the year in peace with all the world, or, which is much the same
thing, with all the readers of_ Notes and Queries, _we propose, on
Saturday next, treating them to a_ Christmas Number, _rich in articles
on_ Folk Lore, Popular Literature, &c., _and to use as ballast for our
barque, which will at such occasion be of unwonted lightness, a number
of Replies which we have by us imploring for admittance into our
columns._

The Index to Volume the Second _will be ready early in January._

_All Catalogues, Bills, or Prospectuses intended for insertion in our
next Monthly Part, must be sent to the Office, 186. Fleet Street, by
Friday the 27th instant._

"Like its predecessors, the volume is amiable and
interesting."--_Notes and Queries._

"Anything written by the Author of 'Proposals for Christian Union' is
sure to be distinguished by an excellent spirit. The 'Greek Church,'
a Sketch, is well put together; and, though slight, will be found to
contain as much real information as many a book of greater size and
more pretension."--_The Guardian_.
