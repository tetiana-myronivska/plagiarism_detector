Book 64        3 John

64:001:001 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the
           truth.

64:001:002 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
           be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

64:001:003 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
           of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the
           truth.

64:001:004 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
           truth.

64:001:005 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
           brethren, and to strangers;

64:001:006 Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
           whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly
           sort, thou shalt do well:

64:001:007 Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
           nothing of the Gentiles.

64:001:008 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
           fellowhelpers to the truth.

64:001:009 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have
           the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

64:001:010 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
           doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not
           content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the
           brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out
           of the church.

64:001:011 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
           good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil
           hath not seen God.

64:001:012 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth
           itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our
           record is true.

64:001:013 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
           write unto thee:

64:001:014 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
           to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the
           friends by name.
