Concerning Anæmia

(Poorness of Blood.)

IN MEN AND WOMEN,

_by the late
DR. ANDREW WILSON._


_The public are very familiar with the term "Anæmia," and this fact
alone testifies to the extremely common nature of the ailment thus
indicated._

_As a rule Anæmia shows a gradual progress. There is experienced a
feeling of lassitude, of being "easily tired out," and a distaste for
active exertion. The digestion is enfeebled, and, without feeling
actually ill, the sufferer inclines towards an inactive life, while the
appetite usually disappears, and a general bodily upset is represented.
The lips are pale, the red of the eyelids, seen by turning down the
lower eyelid, will exhibit a similar appearance. Breathlessness is
another notable sign; the least exertion, going upstairs for instance,
causes the sufferer to pant, because the heart, not being supplied with
blood of good quality, cannot perform its work properly. The pulse is
weak and irregular._

    _For ANÆMIA (shown by breathlessness on slight exertion, pallor,
    depression and weakness) Doctors prescribe the well-known Iron
    Jelloids No. 2.--there is nothing better._

    _For DEBILITY, WEAKNESS and NERVINESS, Men find the Ideal Tonic
    and Restorative in Iron Jelloids No. 2A._


_A Ten Days Treatment (price 1/3) will convince you._

  Preface        _"Arms and the man" was Virgil's strain;
                  But we propose in lighter vein
                  To browse a crop from pastures (Green's)
                  Of England's Evolution scenes.
                  Who would from facts prognosticate
                  The future progress of this State,
                  Must own the chiefest fact to be
                  Her escalator is the Sea._

  Prehistoric     Historians erudite and sage,
                  When writing of the past stone age,
                  Tell us man once was clothed in skins
                  And tattooed patterns on his shins.
                  Rough bearded and with shaggy locks
                  He lived in dug-outs in the rocks.
                  Was often scared and run to earth
                  By creatures of abnormal girth:
                  Mammoths and monsters; truth to tell
                  We find their names too long to spell.
                  He joined in little feuds no doubt;
                  And with his weapons fashioned out
                  Of flint, went boldly to the fray;
                  And cracked a skull or two per day.

  Druids          We read of priests of Celtic day,
                  Ancient Druids, holding sway
                  By smattering of Occult law
                  And man's eternal sense of awe.
  Stonehenge      They used Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain
                  Reputed Prehistoric Fane;
                  Note each megalithic boulder;
                  No Monument in Europe's older.

  Phoenicians     Merchant explorers of that day,
                  Hustling Phoenicians, came this way
                  To ship tin ore from Cornish mines
                  Three thousand years before these lines.
                  But still in spite of petty strife
                  Man lived what's termed the 'simple life'
  Julius Cæsar    Till Julius Cæsar in five-five
  B.C. 55         With his galleys did arrive.
                  He wrote despatches of the best,
                  'Veni, Vidi' and the rest,
                  Sending the news of victory home;
                  And flags then fluttered high in Rome.
                  His 'photo' one plain fact discloses
                  He brought in fashion Roman noses.
                  Of this great General 'tis allowed
                  The best 'Life' is by J. A. Froude.
  Boadicea        Boadicea earns our praise.
  A.D. 62         First woman leader in those days;
                  For Freedom strove all she could do,
                  'Twas lost in A.D. sixty-two.
  Agricola        Then came Agricola one day
                  And gained a battle near the Tay.
                  He started trimming up this isle,
                  And laid out roads in Roman style.
                  East, North, South, West, it's safe to say
                  His handiwork is traced to-day.
                  The Natives too were taught to know
                  By busy merchants' constant flow
                  The wisdom that great Empire held;
                  Their ignorance was thus dispelled.
  Romans left     About four hundred-ten A.D.
  A.D. 410        The Romans left sans cérémonie.
                  Can it be wondered at when Rome
                  Was needing help 'gainst Huns at home.
                  Our antiquarians often find
                  The relics which they left behind;
                  A Villa here and pavement there,
                  Coins galore and Roman ware.

  Anglo-Saxons    And so we run our flippant rhymes
  A.D. 430        Right on to Anglo-Saxon times.
                  Hengist and Horsa with their men
                  Came from their Jutish pirate den,
  Jutes           And paid us visits in their ships
                  Bent on their ruthless looting trips.
                  And Angles landing in the Humber
                  Gave that district little slumber.
                  They plundered morning, noon, and night,
                  Were rough, uncouth, and impolite,
                  No 'By your leave' or 'S'il vous plait'
                  They came to rob, remained to prey.
  Horsa           Horsa was slain in four-five-five,
  455             Leaving Hengist still alive
                  To live out his allotted term,
                  Surviving partner of the Firm.
  King Arthur     Time has many a fable wound
                  About King Arthur's table round,
                  Where Knights quaffed cordials, wines and ales,
                  And told their little fairy tales.
  Augustine       About six hundred years A.D.
  597             To teach us Christianity
                  Came Augustine. Wondrous Story;
                  Canterbury's Pile his glory.
  Heptarchy       Called 'Heptarchy' the seven Saxon
  827             States each other made attacks on;
                  After four hundred years they'd striven
                  They coalesced in eight-two-seven.

  Alfred          Of good King Alfred we've all heard
  872-901         How when hiding he incurred
                  A lady's anger for not taking
                  Care of Cakes which she was baking.
                  (Most probably she left the King
                  While she went out a-gossiping.)
                  Before he died in nine-nought-one,
                  Old England's Navy had begun.
                  He laid a tax on every town
                  To aid his fleet to gain renown.
                  He was the best of Saxon Kings
                  And did a lot of useful things;
                  Built Oxford with its noble spires
                  And mapped out England into Shires.

  Danes           In seven-eight-three first came the Danes
  783             Who caused the Saxons aches and pains.
                  They sailed right up our rivers broad,
                  Putting the natives to the sword.
  "Danegeld"      For centuries our sadly fated
  991             Towns by them were devastated.
                  Etheldred the 'Unready Toff'
                  By 'Danegeld' tries to buy them off.

[Illustration: IRON JELLOIDS The Great Tonic]

  Canute          Two hundred years the raiding Danes
  1014-1036       Came over. Then their Canute reigns.
                  We'll merely mention that he tried
                  An object lesson with the tide.
  Hardicanute     Hardicanute, sad to confess,
  1039-1041       Died from drinking to excess.
                  He couldn't conquer love of wine
                  And with him went the Danish line.

  Edward          Edward the Confessor staid
  the Confessor   The Saxon line renewed. Remade
  1041-1066       At Westminster the Abbey grand,
                  And signed the first 'Will' in this land.
                  And since his time ('tis not refuted)
                  Scores of Wills have been disputed.
                  Ah! legal quibbles such as these
                  Mean Lawyers waxing rich on fees.

  Harold          Harold last of the Saxon line
  1066            At Hastings made an effort fine
                  And lost his life--it was to be,
                  Crushed by the men of Normandy.
                  From Scandinavia they'd come,
                  And made fair Normandy their home;
  William the     Whence William spying out our shore,
  Conqueror       Oliver-Twist-like, wanted more.
  1066-1087       In ten-six-six he won the day
                  In that tough fight out Hastings way.
                  Of course, no record in our reach,
                  Depicts 'ole Bill' thus on the beach.

  William the     But one thing's certain. Camera men,
  Conqueror       If only they'd existed then,
  1066-1087       Would have journeyed many a mile
                  To 'snap' King William's happy smile.
                  They made him King and schoolbooks say
                  He ruled with arbitrary sway;
                  Demanding with sharp battle axes
                  Instant payment of big taxes.
  Curfew          And p'raps it's just as well to tell
                  He introduced the Curfew Bell;
                  So at the early hour of eight
                  Each doused his glim, raked out his grate.
                  In bed at eight P.M. each day
                  Life was but sombre, dull and grey;
                  No cutting fancy ball room capers,
                  No Cinemas or evening papers.
                  He was a bully it is true,
                  But to allow him his just due
                  He made reforms; he also took
                  In hand the bulky Doomsday book.

                  In William's time we're glad to write
                  People began to be polite;
                  Ladies curtseyed to their beaux,
                  Who smartly raised their gay chapeaux.
  The Jews        The Jews he introduced from Spain
                  Bringing much knowledge in their train
                  Of Arts and Science; but 'Longshanks'
                  Expelled them with no word of thanks.
  Feudalism       These were the well known Feudal days,
                  Tenants were slaves in many ways
                  To mighty Lords who owned the land
                  And ruled them with an iron hand.
                  Not free from duties were the Lords,
                  The King could call upon their swords
                  And men to fight in time of need.
                  So feudal laws of old decreed.

  William Rufus   William Rufus or the 'Red'
  1087-1100       In ten-eight-seven ruled instead;
                  This may be; but we know, alack,
                  Though he was red his deeds were black.
  Crusades        The first Crusade in ten-nine-five,
  1095            A million men, a very hive,
                  Swarm to the East, the Holy plain
                  From the Mohammedans to gain.

  Henry I.        Henry the First, of wisdom rife,
  1100-1135       Saxon Matilda makes his wife,
                  Saxon and Norman line uniting,
                  A learned chap who loved not fighting.

  Stephen         Stephen of Blois ascends the throne
  1135-115        And 'gainst Matilda holds his own;
                  Grandson of the Conqueror;
                  Died in eleven-fifty-four.

  Henry II.       Henry the Second claims our rhyme
  1154-1189       'The hardest worker of his time';
                  A wiser King we never had
                  Nor father with his sons so bad.
  Becket          This the first 'Plantagenet' King
                  With Becket strove like anything;
  Church v.       Which should be Master, Church or Crown
  Crown           Pull-King Pull-Bishop; both went down.
                  Thomas was murdered by four Knights
                  On steps of Altar--Sorry wights:
                  With bleeding feet the King atones
                  By pilgrimage to Becket's bones.
                  Despite his struggles with the Church
                  He knocked the barons off their perch,
                  Fifteen hundred Castles razing
                  In a manner quite amazing.
  Law             Trial by jury further grows;
                  The King's Court in this reign arose;
                  Our Parliaments from this proceed
                  And all our other Courts indeed.
  Linen           Linen's first used in twelve-five
                  Woollens alone in vogue before.
  Glass Windows   In eleven-eight-nought first came to pass
                  The novelty of window glass.
                  And doubtless playful little boys
                  Full of children's simple joys,
                  Cracked as our youngsters often do
                  With stones or ball a pane or two.
  Richard         Coeur de Lion from one Crusade
  Coeur de Lion   Returning was a prisoner made.
  1189-1199       But Blondel played an Air he knew,
                  The King joined in; Voilà the clue.
                  This catchy tune in a pleasant key
                  Opened the door to liberty.

  John            And so we'll quickly journey on
  1199-1216       Until we reach the reign of John;
                  A King whose list of crimes was heavy;
                  He treated badly his young 'Nevvy'.
  Magna Charta    He signed the Magna Charta. Yes;
  1215            In twelve-fifteen, but we may guess
                  With much ill grace and many a twist;
                  For King John wrote an awful fist.
                  John loses Normandy to France
                  And by this beneficial chance
                  In England comes amalgamation;
                  Normans and Saxons form one Nation
  Robin Hood      And now we come to Robin Hood,
                  The Forest bandit of Sherwood,
                  A popular hero much belauded
                  But not by folks whom he'd defrauded.
                  There's no need to descant upon
                  His boon companion 'Little John';
                  Or 'Friar Tuck' so overblown
                  He tipped the scale at fifteen stone.

  Henry III.      And what of Henry number Three,
  1216-1272       The King who suffered poverty?
                  It's very awkward we must own
                  To be 'hard up' when on a Throne;

[Illustration: IRON JELLOIDS The Great Tonic]

                  To have to scrape up an amount
                  To pay the butcher on account,
                  Or ask a dun in Kingly way
                  To kindly call some other day.
  Coinage         In twelve-five-seven it is stated
  1257            Gold was coined and circulated,
                  Ha'pence and farthings just before;
                  In those times worth a great deal more.
  Langton         The Bible which from over seas

  Astrology       Many simple folk, (it's queer)

  1399-1413       In Richard's wheel puts many a spoke;
                  Compels him to resign the throne

                  Giving the first recorded sneeze.

  James I.        James Six of Scotland, miscalled a 'fule'
  1603-1625       As James One of England comes to rule.
                  Gramercy! 'tis a canny thing
                  To be a 'double-barrelled' King.
                  The son of Mary Queen of Scots
                  Of learning he had lots and lots,
                  Writing sundry ponderous books
                  'Gainst 'bacca, witches and their spooks.
                  James thought his kingly power divine
                  And, loathing Puritanic 'whine,'
                  He vowed to make them all comply
                  Or else he'd 'know the reason why.'
  Pilgrim Fathers His persecution to escape
  1620            Some Zealots in the 'Mayflower' shape
                  Their course for an uncharted world
                  Where Freedom's Flag could be unfurled.
                  These 'Pilgrim Fathers' found a state
                  'New England,' blessed with happy fate.
                  Folks have called the first King James
                  Most uncomplimentary names;
                  To wit 'a sloven' and 'a glutton';
                  Perhaps his weakness was Scotch Mutton.
                  And as to gluttony, 'Gadzooks'!
                  If what we read in History books
                  Is true, they all were trenchermen;
                  There were no diet faddists then.
                  It startles us, one must declare,

                  And divers meats, roast, boiled and sliced.
                  In James' reign a man could get
                  For money down a coronet
                  And titles with the greatest ease
                  Like folks to-day buy soap and cheese.

THE FIRST CRACKER]

                  So rockets with their sweeping curves,
                  Crackers which upset the nerves
                  And squibs with their infernal din
                  To this date owe their origin.

  Charles I.      His son Charles One we understand
  1625-1649       Ruled England with a grasping hand;
                  For he was never loth to levy
                  Taxes burdensome and heavy.
                  He moved in an expensive set,
                  Was always heavily in debt;
                  In fact this monarch with his frills
                  Was snowed up to the neck with bills.
                  He was courtly, graceful, distingué,
                  And when the scaffold came his way
                  'He nothing common did or mean
                  Upon that memorable scene.'
                  He had a very taking way
                  And made his taxed up subjects pay;
                  And over taxing it is said
                  This Monarch fairly lost his head.
  Petition of     The 'Petition of Right' a famous Act,

                  Then the first Censor came along.
                  This journal cribbing from the Dutch
                  Lacked the smart journalistic touch;
                  And also photographic views,
                  'Sporting pars' and 'Stop-press News.'

_THAT QUIET MAN, KNOWN AS THE EARLY PURITAN._]

  Cotton          Cotton first came from India's shore
  1630            In sixteen-thirty, less or more;
                  Where for three thousand years it grew,
                  Also in Egypt and Peru.
                  Grim reading is the note confessing
                  Gangs went out for Navy pressing,
                  Forcing many a timid knave
                  To spend his life on ocean wave.
  Ship Money      Charles raises the ship money tax;
  1636            He thought he only had to 'ax';
                  When Hampden strenuously objected,
                  The King was very much affected.
  Strafford       Earl Strafford ('Thorough') in his pride
  1641            'The King shall rule the Commons' cried;
                  The Commons would not brook such stuff
                  And cut his head off. 'Quantum Suff.'
                  The 'Grand Remonstrance' is put forth
                  By the Commons who are wrath
                  With the King's despotic ways
                  Quite unsuited to these days.
                  The King tries hard to put in jail
                  Five Members but without avail;
                  Hollis, Strode, Haslerig and Pym
                  And Hampden (we must mention him);
                  They're guarded from the Royal hands
                  By Watermen and City Bands.
                  The 'die is cast' and Civil War
                  For seven long years the Nation tore.

  Civil Wars      Cromwell greatest of the foemen
  1642-1648       With his faithful English Yeomen;
                  These 'Roundheads' sober, grim, religious
                  To 'Cavaliers' gave blows prodigious.
                  Their character's seen in the cry
                  'Trust God and keep your powder dry.'
  Naseby          The Cavaliers and Roundheads fought
  1645            In many a field, 'till Naseby brought
                  To Generals Cromwell and Fairfax
                  A crowning victory, though not 'pax.'
                  The King's beheaded, but the State
                  Experiences no headless fate;
                  A commonwealth's forthwith proclaimed
                  And Cromwell's soon Protector named.
  Dunbar          In sixteen-fifty Dunbar sees
  1650            The Royal Scots brought to their knees;
  Worcester       And in the second Worcester fight
  1651            Cromwell for good asserts his might.
                  And there are those who love to tell
                  About that day at Boscobel
                  When Charles the Second's Majestye
                  Found itself doubly 'up a tree.'
                  And now we meet that quiet man
                  Known as the early Puritan;
                  Mild and placid in his talk,
                  Calm and measured in his walk.

  Commonwealth    Oliver Cromwell bluff and bold,
  1649-1660       Was cast in Nature's sternest mould,
                  Lacking maybe the courtly grace
                  And proud of warts upon his face.
                  He fought the Irish and the Scotch
                  And with his navy beat the Dutch
                  Let all his faults condonéd be,
                  He kept us up on land and sea.

  Commonwealth    He seemed to like bold argument
  (continued)     And wordy wars with Parliament;
                  He made things lively we infer
                  Frequently at Westminster.

[Illustration: IRON JELLOIDS The Great Tonic]

                  With M.P.s he had many a bout
                  And one day cleared the whole lot out;
                  Locked the door and took the key;
                  Those not the days of 'Wait and See.'

  Charles II.     Cromwell's death brings Restoration
  1660-1685       And Charles Two lands 'mid acclamation.
                  After his leaps from twig to twig
                  He now has 'Otium cum Dig.'
                  In merry Charles the Second's age
                  Woman first acted on the stage;
                  The King encouraged much this vogue
                  He was a pleasure seeking rogue.
                  'He never said a foolish thing,
                  Nor did a wise one'; this the King
                  Countered with 'My words my own
                  My acts my ministers' alone';
  1662            In sixteen-six-two year of grace,
                  Charles taxed every fire-place;
                  And citizens who couldn't pay
                  Shivered and grumbled as to-day.
                  These were the times of Musketeers
                  And proud and dashing Cavaliers;
                  When words were few and tempers hot
                  And duels fought out on the spot.

  John Bunyan     The tinker preacher Bunyan wrote
                  The 'Pilgrim's Progress' we still quote,
                  The prison bars no barrier wrought
                  To lowly Bunyan's lofty thought.
  Milton          In stately language Milton's muse
  1678            The Bible story doth diffuse;
                  From 'Paradise Lost' we get our view
                  Of Adam and Eve and Satan too.
                  The Reverend Titus Oates, a scamp,
                  Egregious Popish plots did vamp,

                  Got Cat-o'-nine-tails for his pains.

                  Right to Davy Jones' locker.
                  But though the Dutch failed to invade,
                  They were not disinclined to trade;
                  So we get 'Hollands,' cheese and hams

_QUEEN ANNE AND THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH._]

  James II.       When Charles Two died his brother James
  1685-1688       Soon put the country into flames;
                  Papistry he would advance,
                  And for that purpose leagued with France.
                  In sixteen-eight-eight his bigot zeal
                  Religious Test Act would repeal;
                  Seven bold Bishops who defied
                  To the Tower were sent and tried.
                  The country raised a hue and cry
                  So off to France the King doth fly.

                  With Mary reigns and all things then
                  Went well with us. Macaulay's page
                  Hails him as Hero of the age.
                  In this reign of William Three,
                  Laws were harsh 'gainst burglary;
                  For they'd a very drastic way
                  And hanged the 'Bill Sykes' of that day.
  National Debt   In sixteen-nine-four we have heard
  1694            The National Debt was first incurred;
                  To careful folk who would invest
                  'Twas not devoid of interest.

                  Depression's worries keep at bay
                  And drive our nervous fears away.
  Bill of Rights  The 'Bill of Rights,' a Charter grand,
  1689            In sixteen-eight-nine frees this land
                  From all encroachments of the Crown
                  Hoi Polloi are no longer down.

  Queen Anne      Good Queen Anne we know is dead;
  1702-1714       She reigned twelve years but it is said
                  'Mrs. Morley,' Marlborough's wife
                  Ruled her more than half her life.
  Marlborough     This was the Duke of Marlborough's day,
                  Who beat the French in every fray;
                  Known for his famous victories
                  At Blenheim and at Ramillies.
                  In seventeen-seven by statute passed
                  English and Scotch unite at last;
                  'One coinage and one Parliament'
                  Both Nations ever since content.
                  About this time, so runs the story,
                  Much is heard of 'Whig and Tory';
                  And shortly after there was rife
                  Many a sign of party strife.
  Dr. Watts       Good Dr. Watts' moral lays
  1674-1748       Were much reputed in these days;
                  And still we lisp at Mother's knee
                  'How doth the little Busy Bee.'
  Pope            Pope, letter-writer and great poet,
  1688-1744       Most quotable of all (ye know it),
                  At Twickenham penned his caustic verse
                  Epigrammatic, smooth and terse.

  George I.       The House of Stuart being ended,
  1714-1727       George of Hanover (descended
                  From daughter of King Jamie One)
                  Comes over to ascend our throne.
                  Of English George knew not a word,
                  Most awkward, not to say absurd,
                  At Cabinet Councils to preside;
                  So from this time the practice died.

  George II.      His son George Two succeeding then
  1727-1760       In person fought at Dettingen.
                  Both these Kings had various fights
                  In Scotland with the Jacobites.
                  William Tull brings in Post Chaises;
                  Now the people ride like 'blazes.';
                  Many can't for they're in trouble,
                  Ruined by the South Sea Bubble.
  Wesleys         John and Charles Wesley, men of mind,
  1703-1791       Revive Religion in Mankind.
                  Founding a Church both broad and low,
                  One-seven-three-nought A. Domini.
                  Beginning as an office clerk,
  Clive           As soldier Clive soon made his mark,
  1746            And conquered India for this Nation;
                  Self 'stounded at his moderation.
                  Bridgwater, Gilbert, Brindley, three
                  Great Engineers this Centurie,
  Canals          Useful canals in England made,
                  The flowing arteries of trade.
  Quebec          General Wolfe seventeen-five-nine
  1759            Captures Quebec--a victory fine,
                  And Canada's the splendid prize
                  For old 'John Bull' to colonise.

  George III.     And now of Georgey number Three:
  1760-1820       Ut mulus obstinatus he
                  Had full sixty years of reign
                  And a big family to train.

_GEORGIAN TIMES._]

  Georgian        We will but very lightly scan
  Times           The customs known as 'Georgian';
                  The times of powdered Belles and Beaux;
                  Patches, paint and furbelows;
                  Of beauteous maids and gallants gay
                  And merry routs at Ranelagh;
                  Gaming parties, cards or pool
                  And 'Fops' of the Beau Brummel School.

                  When rank and fashion History tells
                  All took their cures among the Wells;
                  And sipped in manner hesitating
                  Daily doses nauseating.
                  But we know better how to act
                  Our cures we purchase more compact
                  For in the Chemists' you can see
                  'Iron Jelloids' priced at 'One and Three.'
                  Lord 'Periwig' and gay 'Fallal'
                  In Sedan Chairs frequent the Mall.
                  'Taxis' and 'Tubes' we beg to state
                  Came in at a much later date.
                  When Brummel, the historic Beau,
                  Made laws for dress and outward show;
                  Whose vests were poems, whose coats were dreams
                  Of gorgeous beauty, so it seems;
                  Who figured in the public gaze
                  A 'Star turn' with his courtly ways;
                  Who fixed the style of a cravat,
                  Lord of Appeal anent a hat.
                  And My Lord Chesterfield was quite
                  The model of the most polite
                  Wrote famous letters. It's a shame,
                  A settee has usurped his name.
  Dr. Johnson     And Dr. Johnson at his ease
  1709-1784       Sipped his tea at the 'Cheshire Cheese,'
                  Or at the 'Mitre' of renown,
                  Spreading his wit throughout the Town.
  Garrick         When Garrick as the 'Moody Dane'
                  Drew the Town to Drury Lane,
  Mrs. Siddons    Sarah Siddons was all the rage
                  Tragedy Queen of every age.
                  Highwaymen arméd to the teeth
                  Waited for prey on Hounslow Heath;
                  Per contra the Highwayman's pate
                  Was oft strung up at Tyburn Gate.
  Capt. Cook      It's only right a History book
  1728-1779       Should mark the feats of Captain Cook;
                  So jot it down in these our Rhymes
                  That round the World he sailed three times.
  Inventions      These are the days of much invention
  1767            The 'Spinning Jenny' we will mention;
                  The 'Cotton Mule' and 'Power Loom';
                  For Authors' names there's lack of room.
  Adam Smith      In his book 'The Wealth of Nations'
  1766            Adam Smith shows the relations
                  Governing the Art of Trading;
                  With influences far pervading.
                  'Man buys as cheaply as he can
                  And sells as dearly, that's his plan.'
                  'Supply Demand each other feed
                  Dearer markets cheap ones bleed.'
  Jenner          Jenner brings in vaccination,
  1796            Boon to every generation;
                  By similar methods now devised
                  Many an ill is exorcised.

_NELSON AND WELLINGTON._]

  American War    In seventeen-sixty and fifteen
  1775            Our Taxes raise the Yankees' spleen.
                  'Unrepresented, you've no right
                  To tax us, therefore we will fight.'
                  Washington, Franklin and the rest
                  Formed a Republic quite the best;
                  We've long been friends. Let us rejoice;
                  But at the time we had no choice.

  French          In France in times of Louis Seize (says)
  Revolution      Oppression dire through countless days
                  Roused Revolution with its tears
                  Mainly through books with wrong ideas.
  Napoleon I.     From Revolution's putrid mess
  1793-1815       A Conqueror's born, quite conscienceless,
                  Millions of men and women died
                  Victims to Napoleon's pride.
                  He plunged all Europe into Wars
                  His own ambition the sole cause.
                  England as usual did her 'bit'
                  And 'Boney' Europe had to quit.
                  During these years of storm and stress
                  Two noble pilots we possess
                  'Chatham and Son' (Pitt is their name),
                  Illustrious on the scroll of fame.
  Nelson 1805     Here we must our homage pay
                  To Nelson of Trafalgar Day;
  Wellington      To Wellington the same is due,
                  Who crowned his fame at Waterloo.

                  And 'Shiver my timbers,' 'Heave ahoy,'
                  The Tar, those times a breezy boy
                  With shiny hat and pigtail long
                  And love for lass and glass and song.
  Discovery of    About this date Electric Force
  Electric Force  Dawns on mankind. Before, of course,
                  In Lightning it was all about,
                  With noise enough to be found out.
                  Coelo eripuit fulmen,
                  'Twas said of Franklin, as ye ken.

                  But who'd have thought it that Galvani
                  When making soup, (this is no blarney)
                  By his power of observation
                  On a frog's legs' oscillation
                  Should find how by chemic ways
                  Electric currents we can raise?
                  To call him 'great' is no flattery;
                  He set us on the wondrous battery.
                  This simple little frog, Heigh Ho!
                  The frog who would a-wooing go;
                  Thy part in electricity
                  Is unmatched eccentricity.
                  This new discovered fact, of course,
                  Leads to the Telegraph of Morse,
                  The Motor and Electric Light
                  The Telephone and more in sight.

  Ireland         Of Ireland but a word or two.
                  Celts were her people and they knew
                  Not benefit of Roman Ruling;
                  Young Europa's Infant Schooling.
                  In century five St. Patrick great
                  Converts them to the Christian state;
                  And from this Western Isle afar,
                  English and Scotch converted are.
  Danes and       Two hundred years from nine-nought-nought
  Ireland         Danes raiding Erin trouble brought;
                  And left them in chaotic state
                  No longer masters of their fate.
                  In those days 'twas 'Woe to the weak,'
                  Saxons and Danes had made us squeak,
                  Then came the Normans in great force
                  And civilised us in due course.
                  They tried the same with Ireland green;
                  But only sowed a feud between
                  The land they'd conquered and Erin,
                  Leading to endless quarrelling.
                  England accepts the Reformation,
                  Catholic still the Irish nation
  Cromwell        Sees Cromwell with them battle join
  Boyne           And William beat them at the Boyne.
                  William Pitt in eighteen-nought-nought
                  Ireland and England's welfare sought
  Act of Union    By 'Act of Union' which he passed;
  1800            But still the wretched squabbles last.

  George IV.      Now come George Four and Will his brother;
  William IV.     With these two kings we need not bother;
                  The first a gourmand, bon viveur,
                  The next a sailor, bluff, sans peur.
                  Trevithick, Newcomen, and Watt
                  Are names will never be forgot;
                  For their crude engines were the source
                  Of man's control of Steam's wild force.
  Steam           By eighteen-thirty man has tamed
  1830            Steam to his use; and widely famed
                  Was puffing 'Rocket' with the power
                  Of doing thirty miles an hour.
                  Steam prompts man to make machines
                  And Factories rise with all that means;
                  Divided more and more is labour
                  Each man leans more on his neighbour.
                  For twenty million pounds the nation
                  Buys our slaves' emancipation.

                  Steam vessels the Atlantic cross.
                  The penny post comes into force.
                  And double knocks bring joys and thrills
                  Sometimes cheques, more often bills.
  Corn Law        The Corn Law duty's brushed away,
  Repeal 18       Hence we enjoy cheap bread to-day.

                  We fain would linger, but alas,
                  These are the periods we must pass.
                  So gentle reader do not grin
                  At sight of cumbrous crinoline.
  Victoria        Since Queen Victoria's palmy days
  1837-1901       Woman has altered all her ways.
                  In those days she was meek and mild
                  And treated almost like a child;
                  Was brought up in a narrow zone;
                  And couldn't call her soul her own.
                  She vegetated, 'tis well known
                  Under the 'cloche' of Chaperone.
  Woman's         But now the 'Franchise' she obtains,
  Status          And her own property retains.
                  What a difference from then,
                  She 'carries on' just like the men.
                  And now at Westminster we see
                  A lady sitting as M.P.

  Darwin          Charles Darwin offers us a Key
  1809-1882       To help unlock the mystery
                  Of Evolution's wondrous span
                  From Protoplasm up to Man.
  Livingstone     The traveller, great Scotch Livingstone,
  1813-1873       Wandered o'er Afric's trackless Zone;
                  Where no white man had ever trod
                  Teaching the blacks the Word of God.
  Crimean War     English, French and Turks unite
                  'Gainst Russia in Crimean fight.
  Indian Mutiny   The Indian Mutiny now arose,
                  'Fat' was the cause that led to blows.
  Atlantic Cable  With efforts many men most able
                  Lay the great Atlantic Cable.
  Suez Canal      Lesseps unites for you and me
                  The Medit'ranean and Red Sea.
  Education Act   The Education Act proposes
                  To make us all as wise as Moses;
                  In eighteen-seven-nought it passed,
                  But each is learning to the last.
  Ballot Act      A couple of years from this we note
  1872            The Ballot Act gives secret vote;
                  Before this Act, e'en since we fear,
                  Folks sold their votes for draughts of beer.

  Edward VII.     Edward Seven, 'Peacemaker' named,
  1901-1910       His efforts to this end far famed.
                  We know it was no idle chance
                  His 'Entente cordiale' with France.
                  True friendship and the peace we want
                  The outcome of this grand Entente.
                  Though not accented in our rhyme
                  We've been fighting all the time;
                  And it's a fact which must be stated
                  Our chief opponent (so 'twas fated)
  Wars with       Our nearest neighbour o'er the Sea
  France          Whose 'No' is 'Non'; whose 'Yes' is 'Oui';
                  Like two schoolboys always sparring
                  Eight hundred years together warring;
                  From Hastings unto Waterloo
                  We'd battles with the brave 'Mossoo.'
                  Now Honi soit qui still y pense;
                  Hurrah for England! Vive la France!


                  And here we come to end our rhymes
                  We've reached the present stirring times,
                  When one and all lent helping hand
                  To keep secure the Motherland.
                  When men went forth to fight the foe
                  And women took to spade and hoe,
                  And donning smocks of nattiest styles,
                  Worked on the land for Farmer Giles.
                  Now three cheers for the dainty maids,
                  Government clerks of different grades;

Concerning
MEN and TONICS

_by the late
DR. ANDREW WILSON._


_"Many a man feels so thoroughly out of sorts, and thinks himself so
dreadfully ill, that he is rather surprised when the doctor tells him
there is not really anything seriously the matter with him at all; that
he just needs a tonic, and should put the brake on as regards work,
worry, or late hours._

_"It is this 'run-down-ness,' 'out-of-sorts-ness,' 'below-par-ness,'
which lead to all kinds of fanciful fears, such as having Brain Fag,
Neurasthenia, and other conditions startling by name at least._

_"Now I have found the form of Iron Jelloids put up with Quinine (called
Iron Jelloids No. 2A), to be an excellent Tonic in all such cases. When
a man or youth feels out-of-sorts, and is not so ill as to require
medical advice, he cannot do better than try a Fortnight's Treatment of
Iron Jelloids No. 2A, as a suitable and effective remedy._

    _For DEBILITY, WEAKNESS and NERVINESS, Men find the Ideal Tonic
    and Restorative in Iron Jelloids No. 2A._

    _For ANÆMIA in Men and Women (shown by breathlessness on slight
    exertion, pallor, depression and weakness) Doctors have for many
    years prescribed the well-known Iron Jelloids No. 2.--there is
    nothing better._


_A Ten Days Treatment (price 1/3) will convince you._

_Mr. J. R. PENNINGTON, Chemist, late of Worksop, writes:--"I always
handle Iron Jelloids with pleasure as my customers are invariably
satisfied with them."_
