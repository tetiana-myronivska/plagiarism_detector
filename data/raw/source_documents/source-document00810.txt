I certainly think _Brandy_ would have won the Gatwick Handicap, but
I suppose the bottle is getting low, and is being reserved in case
the Cambridgeshire is run on a cold day! And that brings me to the
consideration of this great race. I do not propose to analyse the form
of all the horses, but will devote my attention to a few of the likely
ones--who should feel complimented thereat (I suppose a horse; can
feel a compliment just as well as it can a whip)--from which might
spring the winner. First and foremost, then, _La Flèche_ has, in my
opinion, enough weight to carry, even if the jockey is included, as I
believe is the case--and I was told by Sir CHARLEY WHITELEY, that to
win the Newmarket Oaks she had to be "bustled up"--a fashion which I
thought had quite gone out!--anyhow, many people think she is "not the
same mare she was"--though how they can have changed her I don't quite
understand, but it would not surprise me to find _Windgall_ the best
of the Baron's on the day.

There are several horses spoken of as "rods in pickle," but as a
rule, these animals stop at "rods" and never get to "poles" much less
"perches!" Should Sir JAS. MILLER win the race, the town may resound
with many a merry _Jödel_, but this is trying weather for voices,
though I believe he is running untried, but certainly trying! There
was some doubt as to the starting of a great favourite, owing to a
report that the owner had been "forestalled"--an excuse which always
sounds very weak to me, as surely if outsiders can back a horse at
a long price, the owner should also be able to do so, and thus put
backers "in the cart"--where _some_ of them would present a picture
which might lead people to think the "cart" was on its way to Tyburn!
There appears to be considerable doubt as to whether _Buccaneer_ has
eaten anything lately or not, so I must discard him; but I think if he
were given a sherry and bitters at once he might recover his appetite
and win, as he is known to be a "glutton" for work! JEWITT's best
will take some beating, when we know which it is, which we shall do
shortly, as no stable is more ready than this to let everyone into
the secret of their "good things;", so if some _Whisperer_, should
tell you that his _Suspender_ is broken, it is on the cards that the
_Pensioner_ may still be able to walk home in safety! But enough
of this (as your readers will doubtless say!)--and let us come to
the point as the knife said to the pencil--so I will conclude by
recommending a "maximum" on my choice, and as it is a foreign one, I
must necessarily break out into foreign poetry--(just as easy to--),

Yours devotedly,

WAS, IS, AND WILL BE.

(_THREE PERIODS OF BIOGRAPHY._)

PAST (_Historical_).--General SIMEON SNOOKES was one of the greatest
Commanders that ever figured in an European war. His defence of
Herren-Bayoz, in 1796, will be long remembered by those of his
grateful countrymen who feared that the Corsican upstart would get
the upper hand in the semi-fraternal struggle in the Portugo-Hispanian
Peninsula. A service nearly as important was performed when SNOOKES
(then a Colonel), led the forlorn hope that gave PEGGE WELL BEY (the
Turkish conqueror) into the grasping hands of the British Government.
Yet still another victory was scored when Captain SNOOKES forced the
gates of Ram and Mar, and brought the proud Earls of the Five Free
Ports to their knees and their senses. That he should have received
the freedom of the City of London was as it should have been, and it
must have been gratifying to his sorrowing friends and relatives that
Royalty itself should have been represented at his obsequies. His fame
as a victorious General will never fade, and although his private
life may have been uninteresting, his connection with the noble
family of DE SCROGGYNS will for ever gain for him the respect of his
fellow-countrymen.

PRESENT (_Anecdotal_).--General SNOOKES--better known in the last
century as "SIMPLE SIMON"--was a most interesting personage. Of
his military career it is unnecessary to speak, as it was extremely
commonplace, and void of incident. He was a _petit maître_--and
numerous tales are told of his gallantry. On one occasion, meeting
Lady BESSIE FRIZZYHEAD; on the Green at Turnham, he called attention
to the fairness of the sunset. "Quite like cream, Lady BESSIE," said
the old _beau_, taking a pinch of snuff. "Whipped, you mean," replied
the malicious maiden, with a smile. "SIMPLE SIMON" simpered, but never
forgave the liberty. At another time the General was speaking to
the late Duke of York, when that illustrious personage commanded the
British Army. "I say, SIMMY," exclaimed H.R.H., "if the French invade
us, you must look after Number One." "You mean, Sir," was the prompt
answer, "Number One Hundred and One!" The King, hearing this anecdote
a little later, made "SIMPLE SIMON" his extra Equerry. But perhaps the
best story of all was that told of his interview with Dean SWIFT. "I
propose listening to your Reverence on Sunday," said the simple one.
"Oh, indeed!" replied the sarcastic ecclesiastic. "Then we shall have
a case of a _Gulliver_ come to judgment!" Many other good stories are
told of this General, whose career was rather in the drawing-room than
in the field of glory. He died in 1825, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey. At his funeral there was a large assemblage of the best-known
people of the day, and amongst them the Editor of the _National
Defender. "Sic transit gloria_," said some-one. "_Mundi_!" added the
journalist.

FUTURE (_Conjectural_).--SNOOKES, SIMEON. No one knows who this person
was, but it is shrewdly conjectured that he may have had some official
connection (possibly as a Government contractor) with one of the
ancient wars. As his monument is defaced, and there are no records of
his family, it is useless to attempt to make his biography any fuller.

"SQUARED!"

A SONG OF A SETTLEMENT.

AIR--"_The Death of Nelson_."

RECITATIVE.

  Near NELSON's monument, with gloom opprest,
  The rowdy mourns a Question, now at rest.
  But ASQUITH's laurels shall not fade with years,
  Whose canny settlement the public cheers.

AIR.

  'Twas in Trafalgar's Square,
  We heard the spouters blare,
    Each rough rejoicing then.
  They scorned churl WARREN's yoke,
  Of order made a joke,
    And claimed the Rights of Men.
  But ASQUITH came, the cool and brave,
  And poured oil on the troubled wave.
    His speech was just a beauty!
  Along each line this meaning ran:--
  "England respects true Rights of Man,
    But means enforcing Duty."

  No more rude mobs may roar,
  A nuisance and a bore,
    Where'er BURNS lead the way.
  As victory is this claimed
  By spouts, by cool sense tamed?
    All right! Let them hooray!
  But dearly is their conquest bought,
  'Twas scarce for this mad GRAHAM fought
    'Tis _fair_, though--there's its beauty.
  All just claims met by this shrewd plan,
  The speechifying Rights of Man,
    Plus the Policeman's duty.

  ASQUITH's clear, certain sound,
  Will spread dismay around;
    _Some_ circles. "We believed!
  ASQUITH was on _our_ side,"
  The roughs will say. "He's tried,
    And we--well, we're deceived.
  If we're _permitted_ in this Square
  To muster there, why should we care?
    The game has lost its beauty!
  Licence unfettered is _our_ plan.
  Who cares a cuss for Rights of Man,
    Checked by that bugbear Duty?"

PRESENTED AT COURT.

MR. PUNCH, SIR,

I am indignant--disgusted! I went last night to see a new piece,
called _The Guardsman_, at the Court Theatre, the plot of which,
reminded me--'tis merely a coincidence--of _Incognita_, now going
strong in St. Martin's Lane. The coincident being that a certain young
man won't marry an uncertain young lady whom they want him to marry,
because he is in love with quite another young lady (as he thinks) who
(the _incognita_) turns out to be the very lady whom he is required
to wed. However, that's not what I'm writing about. I leave criticism
to your "professional gent." Well, Sir, it was very amusing, and
very well acted. But from a military point of view, shameful,
Sir!--shameful! The people about me were laughing, and said that the
lines were good; that, take it all round, it ought to be a success;
that it was most amusing. But how could I appreciate anything when I
found a Captain in the Guards, on the Queen's Birthday, walking about
in plain leather boots! It was as bad, in my mind, as when Mr. CHARLES
WARNER, in the piece called _In the Ranks_, appeared as a private in
the same distinguished Regiment in patent leathers! And what was the
Captain doing, Sir, in mess uniform at his uncle's chambers, when he
was supposed to be on guard at the Tower? At least so I understood him
to be, but I may have been wrong. At any rate, an odd sort of place
to dine at, if he was not on duty, and if he were, he should not have
left his post. Moreover, where was his scarf, as orderly officer? But
perhaps he was not on duty, and had dropped in upon the mess (in the
height of the Season!) in a friendly sort of way. Well, that might
explain matters a bit, but not to my entire satisfaction. And my wife
tells me that it is rather late to make alterations in a Court dress
the day before the Drawing-Room. And she says, too, that she has never
been hustled and crushed when she has gone to Buckingham Palace. And
if it comes to that, Sir, I have accompanied her, and can vouch for
the strict accuracy of the statement. But these are minor matters.
What I _cannot_ stand are _The Guardsman's_ boots!

Yours more in anger than in sorrow,

THE BATTLE OF THE BARDS;

_OR, THE LISTS FOR THE LAURELS._

FYTTE THE SECOND.

  "Wire in, my warblers!" PUNCHIUS cried. "To 'wire,'
  Though slangy, sounds appropriate to the Lyre."
  Then forth there toddled with the mincing gait
  Of some fair "Tottering Lily," him, the great
  New Bard of Buddha! Grave, and grey of crest.
  'Tis he illumes the nubibustic West
  With the true "_Light of Asia_"--or, at least,
  Such simulacrum of the effulgent East
  As shineth from a homemade Chinese lantern.
  No HAFIZ he, or SAADI, yet he _can_ turn
  Authentic Sanscrit to--Telegraphese,
  And make the Muse a moon-faced Japanese.
  Leaderesque love of gentle gush and "Caps.,"
  Is blent in him with fondness for the Japs.
  "Wah! wah! futtee!--wah! wah, gooroo!" he cried,
  And twanged his tinkling orient lyre with pride.

THE MOANING OF THE BARDS.

  No moaning of the _bards_! A pleasant quip!
    No manufactured gloom to dim that far light!
  Of dirge's luxury deprive my lip?
    So suns might say there shall be no more starlight!

  Lamping is _not_ required at day's full noon,
    Lanterns _are_ out of place in dawn's fair flush-light;
  But when dark night sets in, and there's no moon,
    There is a chance for stars, or even a rushlight.

  No moaning of the bards? That were hard lines
    For minor line-spinners, imperial TENNYSON!
  Owls only have their chance when day declines,
    That's why the night-birds crown thee with prompt benison.

  LEWIS has wailed and warbled--twiddlingly:
    ALFRED has--rootley-tootlely--wailed and warbled;
  WILLIAM's young Muse hath wept--then why not Me,
    Whose brow, not less than theirs, with woe is marbled?

  ROBERT and AUSTIN (DOBSON) took their turns;
    There is some talk, too, of Sir THEODORE MARTIN.
  Seeing _my_ lips, too, thrill, _my_ heart, too, burns,
    Why the great contest should I take no part in!

  May be I do not carry guns enough
    To epically glorify King ARTHUR,
  But I have penned some reams of rhythmic stuff
    Concerning (please admire the rhyme!) SIDDÁRTHA.

  (That, as an "assonance," is quite as good
    As "_sang_ it," and "_began_ it.") Ornamental
  And Eastern Mythos draws me; but I'm good
    At "Poems National and Non-Oriental."

  I love the Hindoos, I adore the Japs;
    I'm fond of scraps of Oriental lingo;
  Yet I'm a patriot, and have hymned, perhaps,
    As much as most, my native god, great Jingo!

  I think a Muse with twinkly almond orbs,
    Would--as a change--in England prove most fetching;
  Is it not plain Jap Art our Art ahsorbs!
    Why not in singing, then, as well as sketching?

  I'm sure my "GEISHA" is as good a girl
    As _Vivien_, or _Faustine_, or e'en _Dolores_.
  Is she more frail, less fair, that perfect pearl
    Of Singing Girls, Xipangu's great'st of glories?

  Knocks her nice little flat nose on the floor,
    In Japanese politeness, my "Half Jewel."
  ALGERNON's nymphs, in song or in _amour_
    Are always coarse and generally cruel.

  "_Pearls of the Faith_," is a most pious work,
    Although AL-MUTÂHÂLI is the stringer.
  But only he who hates "The Unspeakable Turk,"
    On _that_ account would blame the Christian singer!

  "Lotus and Jewel!" Doesn't that sound nice?
    My mild Jap Muse _may_ be a roguey-poguey;
  But there's no stimulus to pleasant vice
    About a holy Brahman or chaste Yogi.

  "Land of the Rising Sun," delightful "Third
    Kingdom of Merry Dreams," of you I'm amorous.
  Must _that_ exclude me from the Wreath? Absurd!
    I'm prettily pious, and I'm gently glamorous.

  My Knighthood proves that I am quite O.K.,
    My dear _D.T._ will answer for my morals;
  I'm steeped in Sanscrit lore, and so must say
    I can't see why I should not wear the laurels!

  "Quite so," said _Punch_. "I like your rhyme--and cheek;
  Still, there be others yet to hear--next week!"

APOLOGIA ARRYGATENSIS.--"'ARRY in Arrygate" was so much sought
after everywhere that it was thought _Mr. Punch_ could not possibly
supply the great demand for this article with sufficient celerity
and dispatch. Hence it happened that the _Harrogate Advertiser_
enthusiastically reproduced the entire article as published in _Mr.
Punch's_ pages, without saying "with your leave, or by your leave,"
to the Proprietors representing _Mr. Punch_. So, _Mr. Punch_, always
kindly and courteous, was compelled in this instance to "know the
reason why." Whereupon _The Harrogate Advertiser_ acknowledged that it
did not "harrogate to itself" any sort of right to republish wholesale
without acknowledgment anything that has appeared in _Mr. Punch's_
pages, and at once handsomely apologised for this instance of
priggishness quite unprecedented in the _Harrogate Advertiser's_
columns (_Vide Harrogate Advertiser_, October 15). _Box_ and _Cox_ are
satisfied. _Causa flnita est. Vive_ 'ARRY! Likewise 'Arrygate! And,
know, all men, by these presents, that _Mr. P._ is quite wide-awake.

    appearance, entirely written and illustrated by children under
    fifteen years of age."--_St. James's Gazette, October 12th._]

  Why, churlish critic, do you hope sincerely
    The rumour, which you mention, is untrue?
  Mere prejudice makes you regard severely
    The cause of liberty which we pursue.
  We are, _The Prattler_ will establish clearly,
    Quite competent to edit a review;
  The age of greatest wisdom will be seen
  To be decidedly below fifteen.

  _We_ never showed, as we need hardly mention,

  From earliest days we spoke about 'declension,'
    And argued on the atmosphere of Mars;
  While parents we put up with, more attention
    We paid towards another kind of "pars.";
  Full soon was lit the journalistic flame,--
  We lisped in leaders, for the leaders came.

  That foolish custom, which, at present smothers
    Our youthful genius, we shall supersede.
  Here are some papers which, with many others,
    Will make _The Prattler_ eminent indeed;--
  A series on "The Management of Mothers,"

  Elsewhere we'll note, in some attractive way,
  The latest long-clothes fashion of the day.

    And modes to tame a fiery governess,
  Descriptions of perambulator-making--
    No need on details to lay further stress,

  While you, who uttered this untimely sneer,
  Will blush, apologise, and disappear!

MY FIRST BRIEF.

[Illustration]

  When you, my first brief, were delivered,
  Every fibre in me quivered
  With delight. I seemed to see
  Myself admitted a Q.C.;
  Piles of briefs upon the table,
  More work to do than I was able;
  Clients scrambling for advice,
  Then LORD CHANCELLOR in a trice.

  I seized my virgin pencil blue,
  Marked and perused you through and through.
  The story brief, instructions short,
  Defendant in a County Court,
  It needed not an ounce of sense
  To see that you had no defence.
  But, erudite in English law,
  I fashioned bricks without the straw.

  Around my chamber-floor I sped.
  Harangued the book-case on each head;
  DEMOSTHENES and CICERO
  On hearing me had cried a go.
  Then I must own that I was nettled--
  Out of Court the case was settled.
  All my points were left unmade,
  And the fee is left unpaid.

POLITE LEARNING.

    [Professor LOMBROSO writes in the _Revue des Revues_ that all
    women are liars. Mr. VICTOR HORSLEY writes in the _Times_ that
    one of Miss COBBE's statements is a lie.]

  Shameful, shocking, rude Professor!
  CRICHTON BROWNE--your predecessor
  In attacks, would-be suppressor
            Of the higher
  Education--once compared them
  To the Pantaloon, and scared them,
  But he was polite, and spared them
            Words like "liar."

  Lie, indeed! There is a middle
  Course--say "fib" or "tarradiddle,"
  "Not quite true," "A sort of riddle
            Facts to smother."
  We, who love the fair romancer--
  Be she talker, singer, dancer,
  What you will, she's sweet--we answer,
            "You're another!"

  As for you, rough Mr. HORSLEY,
  Arguing so very coarsely,
  May I say yours is a worse lie,--
            Rhyming badly?
  You, so skilled in vivisection,
  Could cut up Miss COBBE's objection,
  With your tongue in some subjection,
            Not thus madly.

  Why, LOMBROSO would despise you,
  Though he is so rude. These "lies" you
  Freely write make folks surmise you
            An impostor,
  Not the lady. You've not "licked" her.
  (Slang to suit you) though you're VICTOR.
  Since you stoop to contradict her
            Like a coster.

SONGS OUT OF SEASON.--MY CARETAKER.

[Illustration]

  A mysterious thing
    For our commonplace day,
  Is the lady I sing
    In the following lay.

  While I'm shooting the grouse,
    Or enjoying the sea,
  She takes care of my house
    For a nominal fee.

  For ten shillings a-week
    Does this wonderful woman
  Undertake, so to speak,
    An existence inhuman.

  Like their dwellings the rabbits
    Deep in darkling retreats,
  This weird widow inhabits
    Subterranean seats.

  What with humour "contrary,"
    Or ironic despair,
  She denominates "airey"--
    From its absence of air!

  It would give _me_ the blues
    Household gods to uphold
  With a _Lloyd's Weekly News_
    Of some fifty days old.

  In a Stygian gloom,
    Far from sun and ozone,
  She sits locked in her room,
    Uncompanioned, alone.

  At a knock, at a call
    How she shivers and starts!
  She's "that nervous"--and "Hall
    Of 'er fambly 'as 'earts."

  Not till gloaming obscure
    Cools hot London at last,
  Hies she forth to procure
    Her ideal repast.

  "_A red 'erring, an inion,
    Just of dripping a bite_"
  --This is not my opinion,
    Hers _verbatim_ I cite.

  But I fancy, though loth to
    Thus detract from her merits,
  (And I've her solemn oath too!)
    That she's "partial to sperrits."

  For once suddenly coming
    (She supposed me away)
  I was struck by her humming
    "_Ta-ra-ra Boom de Ay!_"

  And not humming it only;
    Also _dancing_ the same,--
  This bereaved, honest, lonely
    Deferential dame!

  "_Ta-ra-ra Boom de Ay!_"
    In my desolate hall;
  I, though prone to be gay,
    Didn't like it at all.

  "Which," she said, "it was Fits--
    The Sint Biteus"--her fling!--
  Yes! The Caretaker, it's
    A mysterious thing.

CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.

(_BY MR. PUNCH'S OWN GROUSE IN THE GUN-ROOM._)

LUNCH (CONTINUED).

How well I remember a certain day in the by-gone years, when for the
first time a great truth suddenly burst upon me in all its glory. The
morning's sport had been unsuccessful. We were all fairly tired, and
some of us, in spite of the moderate temperature, were perspiring
freely. For we had been walking up late partridges most of the
morning, with just an occasional shot here and there at pheasants in
covert. Now, late partridges are perhaps the least amenable of created
things. They cherish a perfectly ridiculous conviction that nature,
in endowing them with life, intended that they should preserve it,
and consequently they hold it to be their one aim and object to fly,
whirring and cheeping, out of sight, long before even an enthusiastic
shot could have a chance of proving to them how beautifully a bird can
be missed. For some reason or other, our host had refused or had been
unable to drive the birds. One result was that we had tramped and
tramped and tramped, getting only rare shots, and doing but little
execution. Another result was, that the place was simply littered
with lost tempers, and we sat down to lunch very much out of conceit
with ourselves, our guns, our cartridges, the keepers, the dogs, and
everything else. The pleasant array of plates and glasses, and the
savoury odours of the meats mitigated, but did not dispel the frowns.
Then suddenly there dropped down amongst us, as it were from the
sky, the Great Woodcock Saga. In a moment the events of the morning
were forgotten, brows cleared, tempers were picked up, and an eager
hilarity reigned over the company, while the adventures of the
wonderful bird were pursued from tree to tree, from clump to clump,
through all the zig-zags of his marvellous flight, until he finally
vanished triumphantly into the unknown.

Now the Great Woodcock Saga is brought about in this way:--First
of all suppose that a woodcock has shown himself somewhere or other
during the morning. If he was seen it follows, as the day follows
the night, (1), that _everybody_ shot at him at the most fantastic
distances without regard to the lives and limbs of the rest of the
party; (2), that (in most cases) everybody missed him; (3), that
everybody, though having, according to his own version, been
especially careful himself, has been placed in imminent peril by the
recklessness of the rest; (4), that everybody threw himself flat on
his face to avoid death; and (5), that the woodcock is not really a
bird at all, but a devil. The following is suggested as an example of
Woodcock-dialogue, the scene being laid at lunch:--
