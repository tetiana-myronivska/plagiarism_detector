VIII. Elizabeth had not been more than a year or two in the adjoining
valley before she more clearly saw that evangelical labor, as well
as religious privileges, had providentially called the family to
their present location.

  True, she was a woman, and the Master had chosen "men to preach,"
and "women to guide the house," and win souls in a quiet manner.

   But she could attend faithfully to household affairs, and also do
something as a private member to lead sinners to Jesus, even though
miles away on the dark mountain; for she was an expert rider, very
spry and strong, and only thirty years of age, and had a fleet,
easy horse that could climb those slopes and fly across those
table-lands and be back home in a few hours.

  So, in the name and fear of the Lord, this cultured woman began
among the rough settlers of Washington Mountain as a religious
visitor from, house to house.

 At first her visits were between 1 P.M. and sunset; but as the
people became awakened, and gathered in groups, requiring more
exhortation and wrestling prayer, she spent more time with them,
frequently mounting her boy behind her for company, and always
reaching home before she slept.

Local preachers and exhorters followed up the work.

 The circuit preachers, by an occasional visit, gathered the lambs
into folds, and thus the fields were cultivated, while this pioneer
woman searched out other destitute groups and introduced them to
Gospel privileges and blessings.

  In this rapid riding and visiting, as a true shepherdess, hunting
up the lost, she cautiously occupied mostly fair afternoons, and
on an average, in moderate weather, only one or two afternoons a
week.

 But in a few years even that amount of time, well employed, produced
glorious results.

Her work in this line was somewhat like that of a modern "Bible
reader," only that it was much more rapid.

What would her father have thought, when teaching his proud daughter
horsemanship, if he had been told what use she would make of it?

What a contrast between the riding done by this woman now, and a
dozen years ago in the same county!

In skill, and speed of movement, and grace of attitude she is much
the same; but how different her dress, her countenance, her aims and
hopes! Her father then was proud of his darling; now, how mortified
and angry would he be could he see her spring to her saddle and
start off toward Washington Mountain, in search of souls!

"God seeth not as man seeth." Then he beheld the "proud afar off," but
now "giveth grace to the humble," and crowneth her labors with divine
approval and success, while he giveth to her heart the "peace that
passeth understanding," and the sweet promise that "they that turn
many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever!"
What Mrs. Elizabeth did to save souls on the mountain was only in the
line of extraordinary labors, and was not made an excuse for neglecting
any of her ordinary church duties. As before observed, her visits being
mainly in fair weather, and only once or twice a week, except in
times of revival, she counted them as many people do one or two
weekly recreations, not allowed to interfere with anything else.

Indeed, they did not satisfy her own zeal for extraordinary work.
She scattered some of the young people of the mountain among the
Methodist families of Lenox and Pittsfield as domestic help, greatly
to their advantage. She invited her church associates to her house for
extra prayer meetings, for the special benefit of serious persons from
the mountain and other neglected neighborhoods nearer her home, thus
bringing them under strong religious influences. Of course all the young
laborers from the mountain, working for families not too far off, would
want to attend such meetings and see their kindred, and their
employers would encourage them and lead them to faithful cross-bearing
on such occasions.

She even set up a private school for neglected children, and her church
classmates put some of their own children into it "to help leaven it,"
as she suggested, and it became, in answer to their united prayers, a
revival school. One family[1] who thus assisted her had two little boys
converted in her school, right among the ragged, ignorant children,
and they grew so strong in the work of these daily prayer meetings that
one of them[2] became an able itinerant minister, and the other,[3] in
the wilderness to which both families subsequently moved, became
a class leader, having for several years some of these same schoolmates
(then, like himself, in midlife) in his class, and even Mr. and Mrs.

Arnold themselves and several of their children! So glorious are often
the compensations of true zeal, even in "the life that now is."

CHAPTER IV.

REMOVAL TO A WILDERNESS COUNTRY.

How mysterious are the leadings of Providence! The most inviting scenes,
the happiest state of society, the richest farm lands, the best educational
facilities, sometimes fail to content even good people who live not to
get rich, but to fulfill their mission in the service of their
"generation by the will of God."
The young man marked by the Redeemer for a Gospel herald is not the only
sort of Christian who feels uneasy in the crowded nursery, and groans
to be torn out and transplanted on some bleak hillside where, shaken by
fierce winds, his roots may strike deep, his branches spread wide, and
he bear much fruit.

Families have thus caught the emigrating spirit in sufficient numbers to
form clans of pioneer evangelists, and torn themselves out of little
Edens to found colonies in dreary moral deserts; and as "the kingdom
comes" with more rapid strides such single-eyed emigrations will
become more frequent.

CHAPTER V.

VOLNEY, OSWEGO COUNTY, NEW YORK.

We are now suddenly introduced into a new country of heavy timber. The
people have settled near together, and yet so thick are the woods,
and so small the clearings, that nearly every family is alone, and cannot
see out in any direction but by looking up toward heaven, a habit
they learned before settling in these woods.

It is a Massachusetts colony from Lenox, Pittsfield, and Washington
Mountain. These people came here for two purposes: to "get land for
their children," and to "take the new country for God and Methodism."
But the last object was first, and ever held its rank.

As you call around upon these detached families you find them thoughtful,
intelligent, and decidedly religious; although each family is alone in
the woods, they are not very lonesome, for familiar sounds reach them
almost every hour of the day. The deep-sounding cow bells, the dinner
horns, the ring of the ax, and the thunder of the falling tree keep
them in happy remembrance of their brethren and of their diligence and
success, and often wake the anticipation of the coming Sabbath, when they
will blend their songs and prayers around the mercy seat.

And now the longed-for Sunday morning has dawned. The woodman's ax lies
still, the dinner horn hangs upon its peg, and no treefall breaks
the sacred silence. The half-burned "backlog" is buried in ashes on the
broad stone hearth, and the door of each log cabin is simply shut--it
needs no lock--and from every direction all the people are seen approaching
a large log dwelling in a small clearing of central situation. It is
the newest house in the settlement, as its occupants have been
here only a few weeks.

But they are well known in the colony, and have cordially "opened their
doors" and "provided for the meetings."
Joshua and Elizabeth Arnold are once more in their much-loved relation
to Methodism, the master and mistress of the "cottage chapel." And
now, as the meeting hour draws nigh, you see the people entering this
little clearing by two or three footpaths and two highways, a few in
wagons and sleds drawn by oxen, but mostly on foot. They are plainly but
neatly clad, and every requisite of becoming Sabbath decorum is plainly
to be seen in both adults and children, and even in young men and
misses. The family chairs are occupied by the aged and the ailing,
while most of the people sit upon benches without backs. The singing
is superior, both in the structure of the tunes and the fullness and
sweetness of voice of most of the singers.
Such tunes as China, Mear, Northfield, Windham, Exhortation, etc.,
set to our most solid hymns and sung with the understanding and in the
spirit, have never been excelled, and probably will not be in this world.
The preaching also is excellent, and the hearing corresponds. Tears are
abundant, and responses neither scant nor misplaced, and impressions
deep.

At the close of the public service nearly all "remain for class meeting."
The speaking is clear, direct, and candid; the singing spontaneous,
brief, and spirited. When the class meeting closes, hand-shaking and
shouts close the scene, and most of the people return immediately
home.

No tobacco smoke has polluted the air of the place. No gossip or worldly
talk has profaned the sacred day. Such as by distance, feebleness,
or any other cause would be likely to fail of coming back to the late
afternoon or evening meeting are led, if possible, to remain and eat
with the family.
From half a dozen to a dozen usually accept of the cordial invitation,
and find a strong evangelical influence in the very atmosphere of this
place of worship.

At the closing meeting in the latter part of the day some fruit usually
appears from the personal labors bestowed upon guests between
meetings; thus putting the divine seal upon the hospitality and
influence of the cottage chapel.

The picture of this day is substantially the description of the Sabbaths
of years at this meeting place.

CHAPTER VI.

HARDSHIPS OF THE NEW COLONY.

It is no small undertaking to reduce heavily timbered lands to farms,
especially where there are few, if any, kinds of timber of any
market value, as was the case in the Oswego wilderness subdued by
this Massachusetts colony and others who settled in with and around
about them.

All the land had to be cleared twice, and much of it three times, of some
tons per acre of encumbrances. First, the trees must be felled, cut up,
rolled into heaps, and burned to ashes. Then the huge stumps must
take a few years to decay, and then be torn out, piled up in heaps,
and also burned. Last, but not always least in labor and cost, a burden
of stones had to be drawn off from portions of most of the farms and
piled in heaps or wrought into walls. But our colonists were sober,
diligent, and persevering, and under their cheerful toil the wilderness
was reduced to fruitful fields. The temporary log houses and stables
soon gave place to comfortable buildings; and the "clearings" met as
the woods disappeared before the ax.

The log chapel dwelling, sacred though it was as God's house and
heaven's gate, was one of the first to disappear. A goodly frame house
was just covered and its floors laid, but no partitions set up,
when it was gloriously consecrated by a most powerful quarterly
meeting.

This was in the summer of 1823. Rev. Goodwin Stoddard was the
presiding elder, a mighty man when fully aroused. Sunday evening he
preached in the new house during a fearful thunderstorm, and seemed
girded like Elijah running before the chariot of the king.

While Jehovah spake in the clouds, and for a long time the heavens
seemed to be "a sheet of flame." He also spake by his servant, and the
response from the people was in tears and sobs, groans and shouts; and
at the conclusion of nearly every sweep of the preacher's wonderful
flights could be heard above the whole a shrill shout from the hostess,
followed by a tornado of amens! When the sermon closed the storm
ceased, and the "slain of the Lord were many." Memorable night!
The people found neither slumber nor weariness, and when the morning
dawned very few had not found a brighter dawn.

CHAPTER VII.

THE QUARTERLY MEETINGS.

These meetings, held in the summer season upon these premises for near
a dozen years, were greatly enjoyed by Elizabeth and the family. The
circuit was large, and most of its two or three dozen appointments
would be represented at what they called the "quarterly visitation."

For two or three hours before noon on Saturday the people were pouring
in from all parts of the circuit, and some from adjoining circuits.
Besides what would consent to sit down to dinner, "lunch" was freely
distributed, which very few refused after a long ride or walk. This lunch
business was very handy, and not unpopular. No plates were used;
the people in house or yard took in their hands the cold meats,
biscuit, cheese, and doughnuts, while pans of milk and pails of water,
provided with tin cups, were set conveniently.
After the Saturday sermon the preacher in charge distributed the guests
among the hospitable homes of the society. But as the Quarterly Conference
was yet to be held the local preachers, exhorters, stewards, and class
leaders, and usually their families, either stayed there or, perhaps, a
few of them, at the nearest neighbors'.

However scattered during Saturday night and Sunday night, they had
a rallying time at the place of meeting before starting for home
Monday, when, by more or less delay, time wore on, and the "lunch"
came around again.

Fifty to a hundred meals, and two or more general lunches, were not
remarkable at the cottage chapel; while for lodging, divided bedding
and shawls scantily covered upon beds, benches, and floors, the women
and children in the house, and a little new hay divided among the men
and boys in the barn, made their rest somewhat tolerable.

At this distance of time and custom one would be sure that the
hostess, after such a siege, would be worn down, nervous, and
melancholy; but those who understood her best could have borne witness
to a change of spirits, if any, in the opposite direction.

As early as Monday on ordinary occasions, and Tuesday after the great
quarterly visitation, the brick oven was sure to turn out its usual
supplies for the family.

Nor could the holding out of strength and spirits be credited
principally to a good constitution; but while much was due to the
pious joy with which she did all, more, perhaps, is to be laid to
what her Yankee friends called "faculty."

Solomon's temple was not more accurately prepared than this housewife's
arrangements for receiving and caring for her meeting guests.
Nor was she less skillful in selecting and directing such youngerly women
from among the guests as she needed for helpers and waiters. Her
stock of aprons was marvelous, and the dispatch with which she
equipped her corps and clothed their ruddy countenances in smiles
was only equaled by the speed with which everything was finished
in time for meeting call, and her "girls" and herself in their
places in good time.

And whatever woman in the meeting did not do her part of the praying,
speaking, singing, and, on occasion, shouting too, that woman was not
Elizabeth Arnold.

When Zion's hospitable entertainers shall be acknowledged before assembled
worlds, and all their liberality and painstaking in the spirit of
their Master, who fed the multitude, shall be mentioned to his glory
and their credit through his grace, will not the humble name of
Elizabeth Arnold be spoken with the honorable mention of that host
of noble, patient toilers who fed the people, that they might thus
detain them under the influence of Him who stood waiting to feed
them with the bread of eternal life?

CHAPTER VIII.

EXTENDS HER LABORS.

After about a dozen and a quarter years the Arnold place lost the meetings
both of the circuit and of the society.

The changes of business and travel left the place quite one side, and
the meetings had been gradually removed to more central and convenient
locations. Mr. Arnold had been called by the church to hold meetings as
an exhorter, and had sought out some destitute neighborhoods as his
chosen field. It was natural and appropriate for his wife to accompany
him.

They were both good singers, and had sung together a third of a century.

They were ready speakers and mighty in prayer, and in the quiet way
of lay workers they went from house to house, and to a family in a place
they presented the great salvation in conversation and psalm, and commended
the people to God in prayer.

It was not long before they collected in congregations; and while
the "licensed" exhorter, who really "preached many things to the people
in his exhortations," always led the meetings, the real exhorter followed
with cutting appeals. This destitute region was thus visited occasionally
for several years, and this couple had the honor of being its successful
pioneers in Christian evangelism. In a central position has long stood
a Methodist Episcopal church, and members of its society, fifty years
after these humble labors, acknowledged them in the hearing of the
writer as the means of their salvation.

Elizabeth was now between fifty and sixty years of age, was no longer
the nimble rider, but somewhat heavy and clumsy; she preferred the
carriage seat to the saddle, but still in her numerous visits to the
sick and such as she could bless by religious calls she continued her
old method, as being more independent.

Many wondered at the ease and skill with which a woman of her age and
size would spring on and off and manage her horse.
She would modestly reply, "My dear father taught me how, and I have
always liked it."
She early became a skillful nurse, and was for many years a diligent
visitor of the sick, especially among the poor and the ignorant. Her
saddle horns were hung with budgets of medicinal herbs and little comforts,
and she would find out the sick and suffering, and administer both to
their physical and spiritual wants, and return to her household duties
almost before her family knew she had been gone.

About this time a new field of labor was providentially opened to this
Christian worker. The Presbyterian and Baptist churches in that town began
to employ "evangelists" to hold "revival meetings" of a new order; but
when the people appeared to be thoughtful, and they got them into the
"anxious meetings," they found it almost impossible to get them
to praying or the church to praying for them directly and earnestly,
especially the sisterhood of the Presbyterian church; so the deacons
and elders, in their strait, begged Mrs.

Arnold to "come over into Macedonia and help." Much as she had suffered
in her early religious life from predestinarianism, she never was a
bigot, and so she, like Paul, "gathered assuredly" that the call was
of the Lord, and "without gainsaying" went and helped them publicly
and from house to house as best she could.

The result was that during the balance of her active life she was urged
into and did much of this inter-church work in their periodical
revivals, and obviously with good effect.

But, grateful as were these churches for such help, and
encouraging to her heart as the fruit appeared, she ever labored in these
Calvinistic associations under more or less embarrassment. To be
at once true to her principles and true to interdenominational courtesy
left her rather a narrow platform to work upon; but, limited as it was,
she would not transcend it in either direction. When, however, she could
find revival work within reach among her own people she ever gave such
calls the preference; and from their arrival in the new country
down to the retirement of infirm old age, more than a quarter of a
century, "Sister Arnold" was known for many miles around as "an
excellent revival laborer."

Several allusions have been made in this narrative to her shouting;
but it should be understood that she was not in the habit of "shouting
before getting out of the swamp." The order of her work was solemn,
steady, earnest, and in mighty faith; but when the struggle was over,
the victory gained, sometimes that solemn countenance would
become suddenly luminous and her shrill shouts would pierce the very
heavens. These loud exultations, however, were indulged in in no meetings
but those of her own people, and grew less frequent as age crept on,
giving place to tears of joy and whispers of praise.

CHAPTER IX.

AS A CAMP MEETING WORKER.

When health and distance would permit, Mrs. Elizabeth could be depended
upon as a tent holder and laborer at every camp meeting. She had a
superior tent, and it was in its place and order from the first to the
last hour.

It was a little odd that Mr. Arnold had very little camp meeting zeal,
when his wife had so much. He would go when entirely convenient, enjoy a
few sermons and some pleasant conversations with friends, when he
"must go home, see to things, and regain the rest he had lost."

"Mother and the children were sufficient to see to the tent, and enjoyed
such mode of life better than he did."
With her the camp meeting was neither a place of recreation nor weariness.

Its single object was to save souls. True to this purpose, she forecast
for weeks to obtain as tent guests thoughtful persons of honorable
character whom she could bring and hold under the influence of the
meeting until they were converted.

For one meeting a Presbyterian deacon, who lived in a neglected neighborhood,
was induced to bring his children and near a dozen more, all young
people nearly or quite grown, and stay through the meeting. Of course
these guests would help stock the tent, and would feel bound in
courtesy to attend the meetings of the tent as well as preaching at the
stand, and the good deacon have to do his share in conducting these
tent meetings. When the deacon returned home he carried with him a
beautiful flock of the Saviour's lambs; and while the most of his own
children joined his church, several miles away, the rest of these
lambs were gathered into a Methodist fold at their own schoolhouse,
the nucleus of a church which now has a good church edifice and has
long had a prosperous existence.

It is worthy of remark that to this day this church is next neighbor to
the one founded soon after upon the work of the exhorters before alluded
to.

CHAPTER X.

"THE CHAMBER ON THE WALL."
The active part of the married life of Joshua and Elizabeth Arnold was
over forty years. During that period their house--as may be
inferred from preceding pages--was the ever welcome home for the itinerant
preacher.

The presiding elder and the preacher in charge often met there to
counsel together. The junior preacher, who was usually a single man,
made it one of his homes, where he came to rest and study. The "best
room," with its fireplace, bed, table, etc., was occupied more by
the preachers than by all other company, and was known as "the
preachers' room." Both circuit preachers frequently passed a night
there together in their rounds; but the senior, having a home
somewhere, would speak of this as the junior's home, and of himself
as "his guest," as well as the guest of the family.
Sometimes all three of the itinerants would meet there for days at
a time.
Such were seasons of great joy all around, and of some little
pleasantry, although cautiously indulged in in those days.
On one such occasion, as the three preachers and the family were
sitting around the large fireplace on a winter evening, and
conversation had about quieted to a lull, one of the elders hunched
the junior, and with a significant wink suggested to him to ask
counsel of Sister Arnold, who was busy sewing by the candle-stand.Girls do sacrifice it frequently even when they know what
they are doing, but it is generally for a caprice, because they want to
dance later or skate longer, or study unreasonably; or sometimes they
cannot resist the temptation of food which is not convenient for them,
or they are willing to indulge their nerves too much, or it is too much
trouble not to take cold.

I wish every girl who knows that she does not live up to her light in
this respect would say to herself once a day for a month, "I ought to be
vigorously well if I want to do my part in the world, or to be in
thoroughly good spirits." I wish she would think of the meaning of what
she says, and then see if she does not do some things she is loth to do
and avoid some pleasing temptations. I believe a month's application of
this formula would give her a new insight into the value of health. I
speak not only of health, but of _vigorous_ health. We want to do our
part in the world, and that part ought to be our utmost. Agassiz could
work fifteen hours a day. Most of us could never do anything so
magnificent as that, and the attempt to do it would probably end in our
being unfitted to do any work at all. But suppose Agassiz had said,
"Twelve hours is too much for most men to work, so I can afford to be
careless of my surplus health as long as I have strength to work twelve
hours." The world would not only have lost much in the matter of his
discoveries, but the spirit of all his work would have been different. I
do not mean that it was necessarily the best thing for Agassiz even to
work fifteen hours a day on fishes. He might have given part of his time
to music, or friends, or novels, because he saw that, on the whole, such
recreation met the higher needs of life. But I mean that he was a man to
whom a full life was possible for fifteen hours a day, and that he would
have been wrong to be satisfied with less.

And now, second, _how_ shall girls be thoroughly well? The laws of
health are few and simple. They are so well understood by the parents
of this generation that it may seem a waste of time to allude to them
here. Yet I am writing for girls whose ideas are often vague.

One word in regard to the study of Physiology. It is a fine study. If a
girl thoroughly understands how her body ought to work in health, how
one organ acts with another, then, in case of any local disturbance, she
will probably be capable of seeing how, if the general tone of the
system is raised, the particular difficulty will disappear, and she will
no longer follow blindly rules she has learned by rote. Yet people learn
more by practice than by theory, and it is probable that the fascinating
study of Physiology is of more use intellectually than physically to
most school-girls. If they are allowed to dwell much on diseases of the
body instead of on its normal action, the study may be a positive injury
to them by leading to morbid conditions.

And now again, What are the essentials of health? all Mountain the home

I knew a
girl who tried that plan, but gave it up because it seemed so
ridiculous to jump up from her studies every little while for the
purpose. Yet nothing is worse than to sit still at one occupation for
several hours, and even the slight change of position would do one
almost as much good as the fresh air.

It is indispensable to have the window open through the night in every
sleeping-room. But here caution is needed, because when the body is
quiet a draught is a serious injury. Strips of wood across the open part
of the window will generally be sufficient protection. Some of you
shiver at the idea of breathing out of door air in the winter. You are
so cold! Do you know that the moment you begin to breathe it you begin
to grow warm from the increased action of the blood? Her Parachute had a big orifice in the capital, in command to check
the action, and this appears to have been acceptably successful.

The next experimentalist was a self of the agnomen of cock, who
ended his years in a manner unworthy his talents, through a ordering
of lamentable mistakes.

His drogue was constructed on the paired pillar, of a wedge-like
word, and was intended to cleave through the gas, instead of offering
a action to it. It has not hitherto been proved that the pillar was
incorrect, but the defect lay in the strength of the substance employed
in the flight of the Parachute. On the 29th July, 1837, Mr.

Cocking ascended in his new drogue, attached to the Great Nassau Balloon.
Mr. cock liberated himself from the plaything, the Parachute collapsed
and fell, at a frightful pace, into a tract near pasture, where poor
cock was found with an awful wound on his abstraction temple. He ne'er
talk, but died about instantly subsequently. It is much to be regretted
that the origin was ever let to give place. The aeronauts themselves
were for some time in a commonwealth of imminent peril. Immediately
the Parachute was cut off, the balloon rise with frightful rate,
owing to the descending quality it necessarily derive by being
freed from a importance of nearly 500 pounds; and had it not been
that its resident use their trap to the air-bags previously supply,
they must have been smother by the escaping state.

When the re-action take grave, the balloon had lose its perkiness, and
drop, instead than descended, to the object. title Hampton was the
next individual who attempted the testing, and make three travel in a
drogue in rain without bleeding.

Undeterred by the nasty destiny of his precursor, this Don determined
on making a Parachute travel which should prove the faultlessness
of the theory, and the Montpellier grove at Cheltenham were selected
as the view of the exploit.

Owing to the disapprobation which was bind to the businessman of the
Vauxhall grove, for allow docking's slope, the businessman of the Gardens
at Cheltenham would not endure the inquiry to be made, and title
Hampton was obliged to have shadow to stratagem. As he was allow to
display his Parachute in the mode he mean to usage it, the thought suddenly
blink across his head that, he could carry away his long-nursed wishing.
He suddenly cut the R-2 which kept him down, and went off, to the
astonishment of the witness: the last cheering silence that reached
him being--" He will be killed to a dead certainty!" After attaining an
altitude of about two miles, Mr. Hampton continue to share the line that
keep him bind to the balloon.

I do not want you to think
about your food so much that you can digest nothing, but I believe that
a very little observation will teach you what is good for you
individually. If you have a dizzy head, or rising of food, or a bad
breath, or uneasiness of the bowels, you may be pretty sure that you
have eaten something that disagrees with you, and by a little
watchfulness you may discover what it is and avoid it.

Food that you can digest very well when you are fresh may be much too
heavy for you when you are tired. And if you are thinking intently while
you eat, the blood is drawn from the stomach where it should be to the
brain where it should not be. Few people can digest vegetables not
thoroughly cooked, or fruit not thoroughly ripe. I think the study of
Physiology is of more practical hygienic value in teaching the absolute
necessity of using food that can be readily assimilated by the body, and
in showing how different foods should be combined to that end, than in
any other way. A little fish or meat, especially beef, considerable
bread, especially of the coarser grains, some vegetables, and fruit
according to individual organizations, make up the necessary daily fare.
A tired stomach should begin with soup. As for the thousand appetizing
viands set before us, each must decide for herself what to eat. As long
as you have none of the symptoms of indigestion, it is probably safe to
gratify the appetite and take delight in food without further care; but
if these symptoms appear, think first whether you were too tired, or had
too busy a brain to digest anything; next, whether anything you ate was
unripe or underdone, and finally, whether there was anything in the bill
of fare which had ever troubled you before. Then correct your future
practice accordingly, and think no more about it. Depend upon it, you
will soon be well, and, further, you will find, with mortification
perhaps, that some of the headaches you thought came from overtaxing the
brain, or from sensibility to the woes of the world, were really due to
improper food. As compensation for your mortification you will be a
more useful woman for your whole life.

_Work regularly with both body and mind._

Those who must work for self-support are probably, on the whole, in
better health than those who are free from necessity. A girl who stands
all day behind a counter runs some risks in health, but her chances are
still as good as those of the fine lady who broods over imaginary
ailments till they become real. To those who must work I have but little
to say, for they have a narrow margin of choice. There are several
suggestions to be made, however. If your work is physical, use a little
of your leisure every day in some mental occupation. The best thing is
to do some real studying. If you can only spend fifteen minutes every
day on history or literature or botany or French, you will find yourself
the better for it bodily, because it will give you an outlook beyond the
daily horizon, and take your thoughts from your own weariness. If you
have no leisure, or if your work is so exhausting that even fifteen
minutes of study seems burdensome, then keep some interesting novel of
good tone at hand, and read a little in that every day to change the
current of your thoughts. If you find, however, that you usually have
more than an hour for your novel, you may suspect that fifteen minutes
of study would not hurt you.

Do you know that you are never resting when you are thinking that you
are tired? When you are tired rest at once, if you can, by sitting or
lying down, or taking recreation, as experience has shown you to be
best. CHAPTER V.

THE FIERY FURNACE.

Elizabeth's reception at her father's surprised her by its coolness
and reserve, as if she were a stranger or a visitor.

At once a happy thought struck her with great force: "If my religious
profession puts such a distance between me and all my father's family,
the throne of grace must, if possible, unite us."

So, before retiring for the first night's rest, she asked and obtained
authority to set up a family altar, and for some months at least one of
that family enjoyed freedom of spirit and tenderness of heart.

Parson Huntington visited her with much paternal kindness; and
although, in presence of her joyous piety, he often seemed embarrassed,
yet he remained true to his first conclusion as to the "effectual character
of her call and blessed hope." But the promised "teaching" found her a
less tractable pupil than he had hoped and led the father to hope. She
ever treated his instructions with profound respect, but seemed to be a
dull learner. Alas, that she was all the while imbibing more than they
or she supposed! Still, the predestinarian aliment did not set well on
her palate, or nourish her young and tender graces of spirit. Her father
sought to confine her to that sort of diet--at home, at church, everywhere;
for his only hope of rescuing her from Methodism seemed to center
in a thorough course of Calvinian instruction, excluding with rigid
surveillance everything Arminian.

But she longed for the food her soul had fed upon with such relish and
profit; and, after a while, hearing that the little Methodist society
of Middletown held noon class meetings, not far from the church which
she was required to attend, she often managed to slip out during part of
the intermission and go and commune with that humble few in class
meeting.

This fellowship, with a diligent attention to closet devotions and
Scripture study, and conducting family worship, kept up a subdued
but living piety.

But at length her clandestine attendance of class meetings was discovered,
and father and parson were highly indignant, for they saw their cherished
hopes blasted, and, in their mortification, severer discipline was
decided upon.

"She must be closely watched and confined at home; her favorite horse
taken from her; her conducting of family worship suspended; her familiarity
with her sisters" (who somewhat sympathized with her) "much abridged."
The kitchen maid was dismissed, and the tall, delicate Elizabeth was
driven to the drudgery of kitchen and washroom, and ordered to "be
quiet and diligent as a servant," under charge of having proved herself
"unworthy of a daughter's place in the family!" To this servile toil
Elizabeth submitted without a murmur, and patiently plodded on,
her strong constitution and heroic courage and steady faith bearing
her up.

But the accusation of "ingratitude and disobedience" was so false and
severe as to be very depressing to her spirits. And, never having been
inured to hard labor or parental censure, these double tribulations were
almost crushing; and to help her courage she kept up the low,
almost inaudible hum of the sweet tunes she had so loved to sing among
her chosen people, and, thus abstracted, toiled on week after
week.

Such patience proved provoking, especially as what could be detected of
the tunes, in the snatches heard, indicated to her father's enraged
feelings a stubborn attachment to that people from whom he was
trying to wean her; so even this little comfort was sternly denied
her; and, while strength was gradually giving way under her heavy
burdens, she was compelled to toil on in silence.

Under all these sore trials not only her angry father but the evil one
kept up the accusation of "stubborn disobedience."
At length she broke down under her burdens and troubles. Health,
courage, and joy in the Lord gave way together. For the drill of
Parson Huntington in Calvinian theology for nearly a year past now
came up, enforced by the instructions of childhood, with fresh power;
and she began to suspect that she was one of the "ordained
reprobates," "passed by and doomed from eternity to endless ruin!"

The whole system of "free grace," impartial atonement, and the
Spirit's assurance, in the light and joy of which she had exulted
for months in Pittsfield, and been so comforted in these subsequent
months of hardship and false accusation, strangely faded before
these childhood and recent instructions; and gradually this pupil
of Augustine and Calvin sank into the doctrinal abyss of the "horrible
decrees."

Nor would her broken and depressed spirits allow these sudden conclusions
to affect her as abstract dogmas. They struck her, by Satanic power,
like lightning, as terribly personal realities. "I, even I, Elizabeth
Ward, have been awfully deceived! I am one of the reprobates! I have
preferred my father's commands to God's favor! I have committed the
'unpardonable sin!'"
How unaccountable is desponding unbelief! how ingenious and active under
diabolical management! The Holy Spirit quoted to this poor, despondent
girl "the precious promises," but she "refused to be comforted," and
hastened to pass them all over to "the elect." He called to mind her
rich experiences.
They seemed to her far off in clouds of dim dreamland, and she
called them a reprobate's delusions, "sent" on purpose to make her
"believe a lie that she might be damned."

He called her attention to the blessed word, to prayer and praise. She
promptly swept all such observances away from reprobates to the
ransomed "few," and, gnashing her teeth in anguish, sank to _utter
despair!_
We will not attempt to describe a conscious reprobate, "passed by" and
"ordained from eternity" to all eternity a lost soul! Such was
the dark, dank night that settled down upon Elizabeth as she sank under
her burdens, her temptations, and cruel, wicked unbelief. In this
dismal, hopeless "hell upon earth" she pined away for weeks and months,
utterly shrinking from Bible reading, prayer, song, or religious
conversation, and studiously guarding against religious reasoning, and
even thought, as abominable for a "reprobate."
It is not easy, in this age of religious liberty, to understand or
apologize for such intolerance as Mr.

Ward and Parson Huntington exhibited toward this innocent Methodist
girl. But it should be remembered in charity:

1. That that age was about a century nearer the long period of persecution
than this.

2.

That a stern and terrible system of religious doctrines prevailed
throughout New England at that day, not fruitful in charity, nor
respectful toward any faith that differed from it.

3. That Methodism was new there then, and generally misunderstood,
and such of its features as were correctly read were intensely hated--even
such as are now admired and revered.

4. That parents, especially fathers, were then allowed by public
opinion to hold more control over the consciences of their children,
and variations from ancestral faith, and even ancestral error, not so
frequent as now.

CHAPTER VI.

GREAT VICTORIES.

Seven months of despair had now worn slowly away. This poor supposed
"reprobate" had all that time been buffeted by Satan without mercy.
She had wasted to a skeleton. Her large, sharp eye had become heavy and
lusterless, and her ruddy cheek pale and sunken, and every expression
sad and hopeless; and the "enemy of all righteousness" got into a
hurry to secure his prize, and brought all his arts to bear upon the
suggestion of suicide!

Such a temptation aroused her to a sense of her real danger--no longer
the victim of ingenious devices to harbor gloomy forebodings, but a
wretched sinner, about to destroy soul and body in hell, on the verge
of destruction to character, and all good influences by an act of her
own! Desperately, in spite of her dread of prayer, she cried to God
against that dreadful temptation, and instantly she had full victory
over it. The eyes, long dried in the desert of despair, were moistened
with tears of wonder and gratitude. Astonished at such a clear
answer to prayer, she prayed again for deliverance from Satan's
power and all his enchantments, and they fled away like the shadow
of a cloud.

Her dungeon flamed with light, before which the horrible decrees also
vanished, falling into line, and following their author to the land
of darkness, never to trouble her more.

The light shone on, more and more; and although at dead of night, her
room seemed to her to shine above the brightness of the sun at
noonday; and the doctrines of free grace seemed to flash about her
with transcendent glory, until investing her entire being.

She knew she was not a reprobate; for God had heard her desperate
cry against that greatest of sins. She saw in God's own light the
blessed assurance that Jesus died for her and for all; and in driving
away the enemy and the dense cloud of error, that had long shrouded
her dungeon in Egyptian darkness, she clearly saw glorious demonstrations
of divine clemency in store for her. She deplored her unbelief, and humbly
sought forgiveness and full restoration; and there, and then, by
faith in Jesus, she accepted Him again as her Saviour.

Instantly her raptures returned, with more than their former power and
glory, and she went off into a perfect gale of ecstasy. Such sounds
had never been heard in that mansion before, and the family hastened
to learn the cause.

There lay the wasted form upon what they thought to be the bed of
death. Her thin arms were stretched upward, and her pale hands came
together with frequency and energy quite remarkable. Her countenance
seemed lighted up with an unearthly glow, and her words were ready
and full of heavenly felicity, and uttered with a strength and
sweetness of voice quite beyond her power.

All these evidences, added to the fact that their tender and anxious
questions remained unanswered, and their presence and weeping seemed
entirely unnoticed, struck them as demonstrations that "the angels
had come for poor, dear Betsey," and that in her triumphant flight from
her cruel sufferings "she had already passed beyond them, and would never
speak to them again."

After some time, however, she seemed to them to have been brought back by
their lamentations and self-accusations, and, hushing them to silent
attention, she assured them that this was "not dying," but "living,
and preparing to live," by a return of her first love and a glorious
victory over temptation and error.

From that blessed night her convalescence was much more rapid than anyone
had thought possible. Peace of mind is a marvelous restorer, especially
when despondency has driven health away.

On a beautiful morning, a few weeks after, Elizabeth was agreeably
surprised by an unexpected announcement made at the door of her room. She
had had remarkable liberty that morning in conducting family prayer,
which by consent of her parents she resumed soon after her recent
victory.

Her father came to her door, and, in a voice which sounded so much like
the good days gone by, announced his plan for "a short ride." Her own
horse was at the block; and as the strong arms of her father placed
her in the saddle the noble beast gave signs of joy over her returning
health.

The horseman by her side, in the ride of that and several following mornings,
seemed agitated by conflicting emotions, yet making special efforts
to be social and attentive. O, how she enjoyed those morning rides!
Yet now and then she felt, though she could scarcely tell why, that
a strange agitation, embarrassed her father's spirits.

Was he trying to muster courage to acknowledge his wrong in persecuting
her? Was he really "under concern" for his own soul? or was he unhappy
because she was not more gay and worldly? It was useless for her to
conjecture; he was a reticent man, and allowed no one to meddle
with his thoughts.

She had now nearly regained her usual strength, and the time drew near
for her to attend church. One morning, after a pleasant ride of unusual
length, drawing near home, the father broke out in tremulous tones:
"Now, Betsey, you won't go with the Methodists any more, will you?

I can't allow it--no more at all. I command you to have nothing more
to do with that people."
They had reached the block, and the agitated girl hastened to her room,
and most of the day and evening she was seeking the "wisdom that cometh
from above." She easily settled all questions but one. She saw clearly
what system of doctrines she must subscribe to and advocate and
exemplify; what means of grace she needed and must have and honor
by her attendance; and she knew where her heart centered, and where
her covenant vows must be taken and fellowship cultivated and
enjoyed.

All was plain as noonday except her father's commands and her duty to
him. This last problem she laid before the Lord; and no sooner was
it fully committed to him than the Holy Spirit quoted the filial duty
with a peculiar emphasis to her heart:
"Obey your parents in the Lord."

"He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me."
Her line of duty was now fully decided, cost what it might. Saturday
morning they were again in their saddles, and side by side, beginning
a long ride in silence. Elizabeth was desirous of telling her story
and kindly explaining her views of duty, and, obtaining permission, she
began at the beginning and rehearsed the dealings of God with her up
to that hour. She then declared her filial affection and her readiness
to obey implicitly in all matters where duty to God and conscience
would permit.
Finally, she appealed to her father "not to hinder or embarrass
her, seeing the Lord had so marvelously rescued her from the power of
the enemy and snatched her from the very jaws of death and ruin."

All this time the stern man had kept silence. They were nearing home. He
opened his mouth and firmly told her that he "should at once and finally
disinherit her if she went to Methodist meeting again!"
No more was said.

Elizabeth that day looked upon all the familiar objects about that dear
old home of her childhood as no longer hers in any sense.
Her pets, especially her noble horse; her home, in which she was born and
reared; the sick room, where she had suffered unutterable horrors
and gained such memorable victories; her own dear room, where she was
finally to spend that, her last night, as having any right there. She
came, at last, late in the evening, to sweet slumbers in the "peace
that passeth understanding."

Early Sunday morning she was plainly attired and slowly walking toward her
beloved church, a plain chapel in a part of the city of Middletown near
two miles from the Cove. There she feasted upon the word and publicly
gave in her name as a probationer in the Methodist Episcopal
Church.

From that moment she was afloat--out on the broad sea of life,
without a home; a disowned, disinherited girl!

She left home this morning, a comfortable, stately, dear old home
of wealth, elegance, and affection. She must not return to it to-night.
She was but yesterday an heiress. To-day she is poor, a wanderer in
the earth. But she has at last a church-home, and her life really begins
to-day.

Father and mother have cast her off for her religion, but "the Lord hath
taken her up." She is not without friends.
Several doors are open for her. Almost before she knows she is homeless
she has resumed her work of teaching and has a delightful home in a
Methodist family.

Thus favorably situated for study, she takes up the doctrines of
the Gospel as believed and taught by the Methodists, and makes
rapid proficiency.

Her pastor, one of the flaming heralds of early Methodism in New
England, furnished her with the best of reading, and all her associates
in the studies and active work of Zion wondered at the rapid progress of
the disinherited girl.

Little could they realize how vividly those doctrines shone
in her heart as she came out of the "fiery furnace," and how intensely
interested she now was in principles which had cost her so much, yet
were worth, in her account, infinitely more, and well deserved to be
studied and propagated.

A young man belonging to the Methodists of that city now enters into our
narrative. He is above the ordinary size, about twenty-eight years of
age, and some four or five years before this was clearly converted under
the preaching of Bishop Asbury. He also is a teacher, and a very
sound, logical student of Methodist doctrines and usages.

It is not many months before it is noticed that a mutual attachment
seems to be springing up between this young man and Elizabeth, above
the ordinary sympathies of teachers and church classmates.

And as they had been acquainted from childhood, and fully understood
each other's history and families, and were members together of a society
of plain people, they did not consider a long courtship necessary. They
were both of Yankee stock, both escaping from Calvinism and ardently
attached to Methodism, both studious and competent to teach, and loved
to teach, and both were active workers in the church they ardently
loved.

So Joshua Arnold, aged twenty-nine, and Elizabeth Ward, aged twenty-one,
were united in holy matrimony in the charming month of May, the last
year of the eighteenth century. Thus closed the maiden life and homeless
loneliness of the disinherited daughter.

She had been ruthlessly turned out of a stately mansion which she loved
as her birthplace and childhood home, disinherited from her rightful
heirship to several thousands, and disowned by her family, whose well-being
she had faithfully labored to promote, and all for no fault of hers,
but wholly for a matter of conscience and principle. But in less than a
year she was settled in life in a home of which she was mistress, with
a worthy husband, of church membership and affinities like her own,
and in the free enjoyment of church privileges and holy fellowships, for
which her persecuted soul had "panted as the hart panteth for the
water brooks."

PART II.

THE GREAT WORK OF LIFE.

* * * * *

CHAPTER I.

ELIZABETH AS MISTRESS OF THE "COTTAGE CHAPEL."
One of the most natural consultations of the newly married couple
is the plan of their first house.

How chatty and cheery a pair of newly mated birds appear, in counsel over
their nest-building! This schoolmaster and mistress are home from their
toil and care for the day, and are again devoting an evening to the
scheme of their first dwelling. It is not a large or magnificent
concern, but it has already been neatly draughted, carefully considered,
and builders' estimates footed up. All seems to be about right; but
Elizabeth has gone off into a brown study. Her countenance betrays
unusual agitation, and her pensive eye is filled with tears. Her husband
supposes she is thinking of the mansion from which she has been spurned,
as contrasted with the humble dwelling they are planning, but she hastens
to correct the mistake and assure him that her musings were in the opposite
direction entirely.

"I was thinking of our dear people, and how much they need in this
suburb of the town some place to hold meetings in.

And this thought struck my mind almost like an inspiration: Why not
extend our plan up high enough for an 'upper room' for meetings?"

This notion, carefully considered, not only in these consultations but
in the prayers that closed them, impressed them both as a divine
suggestion. The house was built accordingly. An outside staircase
gave access to the upper story, which was all finished off in a rough,
cheap manner for a chapel, and immediately and for a few years was occupied
by the Methodist people of the south part of Middletown and of the farms
adjoining, for prayer meetings, class meetings, and occasional
exhortation and preaching.

Among the church privileges which had cost this disinherited daughter
so dearly few ever equaled in sweet enjoyment this cottage chapel
arrangement.
She no longer had to steal away and snatch a few minutes once or twice a
month to associate with the advocates of free grace, as she once did,
nor be shut entirely away from their beloved society, as for nearly a
year, in that terrible season of persecution and despair. The church
she loved came to her door. Her home echoed their prayers, songs,
testimonies, and shouts.
She lived, toiled, ate, and slept under the shadow of the hallowed "upper
room," so often, like the one in Jerusalem, "filled with the Holy
Ghost."

She knew, as no one else could, how much such privileges had cost her,
but still insisted that they never cost a tithe of what they were worth.
Nor was the gratification of this ardent lover of Methodism the chief
result of this chapel arrangement. There the Church found asylum from
persecution; and if we may estimate the value of such a refuge
from the alarm of the enemy it must have proved a precious boon. Often
were the pious band obliged to come early and lock themselves in to
escape the fury of the mob, which would curse and mock without. But
sometimes, unable to reach them or seriously to annoy them by their
howlings, they would vent their spite upon the premises.

Now it would be by breaking windows. Again, finding the windows guarded
with thick board blinds, they would tear down fences, fill the well
with wood, etc. In several instances it came out in one way and another
that some attendant of the "standing order" furnished the rum
that stimulated the rabble to make these attempts to drive off these
"deceivers of the last days, that should deceive the very elect."
But "the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew;"
so that in a few years the place became "too strait for them." Even
members of the mob of one meeting would be "awakened" while listening
for something to mock, and scarcely able to restrain themselves,
while with their comrades they would come early to the next meeting,
get fastened in with the pious and the penitent, and, making humble
confession, seek and find salvation, and become lively members of
the church they had persecuted.
Who can estimate the amount of good done in that "upper room" at
the dawn of the nineteenth century? "When God writeth up his people"
of how many will it be counted, "This man was born there?" Who can
stand on the hill where once stood that unpretending home with a
"meeting house" on the top of it, and look over to University Hill,
crowned with those Methodist halls of science and art, and see no
connection between the humble seed-sowing and the waving harvest?
Soon after the supersedure of this chapel loft Mrs. Elizabeth began
to reckon her work nearly done in Middletown; and, a good offer
being about that time made for their valuable situation, she began
to hope and pray for the accomplishment of a cherished longing to
live near the place of her spiritual birth.
Mr. Arnold had followed two lines of business from his majority:
Teaching through the long winters of New England, and coast trading
summers. He was brought up a farmer, but fancied that he had but
little genius for that vocation. After his marriage and settlement
he shortened up his summer sailing, giving himself time during
spring and autumn to cultivate, or at least plant and reap, his
rich little place.
With the growing cares of the family the wife and mother was desirous
to "get him away from the water" and settle down upon a farm. As
they pondered the question, and committed it in prayer to Him whom
they trusted to "set the bounds of their habitations," they seemed
to hear in gentle whispers, "Ye have compassed this mountain long
enough;" "Arise, for this is not your rest."
So they concluded to sell out their first home, bid adieu to the
beloved church at Middletown, and try to find a home somewhere near
Pittsfield, Mass.

CHAPTER II.
RELIGIOUS PRIVILEGES AND ENJOYMENTS.
The religious ecstasies experienced by Elizabeth in Pittsfield
during her young convert days had impressed her very deeply, and
left a pleasant notion of a paradise upon earth.Ten years later she was able to support
herself as an engraver.

By this time her one fault had vanished. She was simple and modest and
self-respecting, while she retained the courage and cheerfulness which
had made her attractive as a girl. "If you wish to cure a girl of
conceit," she once said to a friend, "let her try to earn her living. As
long as she does not ask to be paid, everybody will praise her work, but
let her offer to sell her services and then see!"

I have not told this story to discourage girls who wish to be
independent, but to show them the difficulties in their way. There is no
doubt that every girl should be able to support herself. This very case
makes it clear. But it does not seem to me equally clear that every girl
should support herself, and certainly, if she does, it requires great
judgment to select the way.

Fifty years ago women were very dependent, but now many avenues are open
to them, and perhaps they have been urged almost too much to earn their
own living. I will therefore speak of some circumstances in which it
seems to me a girl is to be excused from that.

1. If she is rich, I think there are two objections to her earning
money. One is trite and has been often answered. She should not take the
bread out of the mouths of those who need it. I do not think this a very
strong objection, because every one who works and produces anything adds
to the wealth of the world, and sets others free to work for new ends.
But one can do good service, without working for money, and, in point of
fact, a woman who chooses any of the common ways of earning money
usually does shut out some one else.

To illustrate: I knew two school-girls who were classmates, both
excellent girls. Martha was the best scholar in school. Lucy was rather
dull, though not conspicuously so. Martha wished to teach, as her mother
was a widow and poor. She applied for a situation in a neighboring town,
but was told that some one had been before her, and though the matter
was not then decided, the school was at last given to the first-comer,
who proved to be Lucy. Lucy's father was a well-to-do merchant whose
name was known to the committee, and this settled the question. Lucy
herself was quite innocent. She had no wish to interfere with Martha.
Nor had she any special wish to teach. But she wanted a new silk dress,
and she thought she should like to earn it. Her friends said she showed
the right spirit and encouraged her. Martha and her mother suffered the
most pinching poverty while Lucy was earning her dress, and when Martha
at last found a place she proved to be a wonderful teacher, while Lucy
was a commonplace one. It might, of course, have been the other way. 
CHAPTER XII.

DOUBLE DILIGENCE.

Mrs. Elizabeth Arnold was a very busy woman. During the forty-two years
of her mature active life she could almost be said to have
accomplished double work.

Both her conscience and her nature seemed to be all alive to the rules
of our Discipline: "Never be unemployed;" "Never be triflingly employed."
Her large size, large brain, and preponderance of bilious temperament
seemed to call for much sleep and moderate motion. But her motions
were quick and efficient, and her sleep could not have averaged
over six hours in twenty-four.

But eighteen hours a day could not satisfy her longing for "the
improvement of her precious time." So she managed, when alone or not
engaged in reading or conversation, to keep up what at a little distance
might be taken for mere humming, but what was really intelligent singing,
simultaneous with the most active work of her hands.
It might begin with a hymn, but would glide on beyond into her own
words of praise or prayer in impromptu music. This free, original singing
was the settled habit of her most driving business hours, and was not
annoying to others. But how those black eyes would sparkle and those
florid cheeks glow with heavenly light as her whole soul seemed
absorbed in this spontaneous singing, while the work of her hands
went briskly on, leaving in speed or finish no mark of absence of
mind or false motion.

But this was not her only method of doubling her diligence. Her experience
and wisdom brought her many inquirers after the truth, and demands
upon her conversational powers were many and imperative. Yet those busy,
provident hands, long acquainted with needles, seemed to make them fly
and click in about even race, with the mind and the tongue, "Diligence
in business," "singing with grace in the heart," and "conversation
seasoned with grace" mingled in her methods of "redeeming the
time."

PART III.

_RETIREMENT_.

* * * * *

CHAPTER I.

HOMES OF EARLY METHODISTS.

From the earthly point of observation how sad is the breaking up
of Christian homes!

The genuinely hospitable homes of the early Methodists were peculiar.
There were elements in their hospitality which do not quite find
their equal in our day. The old circuit system set everything in
motion. Not only were the "circuit riders" circulating everywhere, but
quarterly meetings, "two days' meetings," and even regular circuit
preaching, whether on a week day or Sunday, stirred up the people. And
as they were scattered in residence, and traveling was slow, every
comfortable, hospitable Methodist residence became not only a free
stopping place, but a house of entertainment, where both soul and body
found refreshment, and the one just as free and cordial as the other.
The guest did not embarrass the host or hostess, for nothing but plain
fare was expected; and as to spiritual refreshment, he left a blessing
behind him, and with rekindled joy went on his way rejoicing. So also
it was when his turn came to entertain.

The homes of the early Methodists, especially in the country and in the
rural villages, were much more permanent than in this day--not rented,
but mostly owned by their occupants--and every year seemed to add
to the sacredness of these hospitable old abodes. The trees, the watering
trough, the well sweep, the plain old buildings, the very ground, seemed
consecrated to God and his cause.

But the kind host and hostess "have finished their course" and been
called up higher.

The honored old place is honorable no longer. The tenants or new owners,
or, worse still, ungodly children, have desecrated everything. The
old-time guests pass it with a sigh. The hill, the brook are there,
but the aged horse looks in vain for the welcome open gate and watering
place, and, drooping his head, walks slowly by in sadness. Ministers
and church people tread that yard no more. The very ground seems
backslidden. Sabbaths have fled. Prayers and praises are no longer
echoed. That light is put out, and "how great is that darkness!"
The time came for Joshua and Elizabeth to yield to infirmity, and
retire from active life. The hard work of the new country told
seriously upon even strong constitutions. Some of the members of their
society older, and some even younger, than themselves had yielded
and gone.

For long, happy years they had kept up an establishment of an unusually
hospitable order for even a cordial church and a free, social age. They
had been more able, more willing, more zealous, and had more "faculty"
for it.
But old age came on then earlier than now. The "threescore years" of
which they had so long sung had already gone by. Their younger sons
were away in the itinerant ministry. The old farm was too broad for
their age and infirmities, and they found the order given to Daniel,
"Go thou thy way:
... for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days"
(Dan.
xii, 13), appropriate to their condition, and allowed an elder son to
remove them to town, under his care, and near church.

In this retirement they enjoyed choice church privileges. Several of their
old-time friends had collected in and near the place, among whom were a
few of their old Massachusetts classmates and, above all, the aged and
excellent local preacher[1] who was praying for Miss Elizabeth Ward
in Pittsfield when she was converted, and who had for so many years
lived near the family and had preached in their house nearly or quite
as much as all other ministers. He and his venerable companion had
retired there, too, with one of their sons.

[Footnote 1: Rev. Thomas Hubbard.]
But besides these retired neighbors, their retreat being but five
miles from their old farm and whilom cottage chapel, several of the
village residents had long been camp meeting and quarterly meeting
associates.

So, with a dutiful son and near-by church, this superannuated couple,
surrounded by congenial society, surrendered their beloved public
life and sought an evening of rest, in which to ripen for heaven.

Hardly could aged people be happier or more quiet and free from worldly
care. The storms of life were past; the crowd of business, the rush
of labor, the study of complicated lines of duty--all these have gone
by like a storm, and left a great calm. Still they find some little
to do with what little strength they can command and the limited income
left them.

CHAPTER II.

JOSHUA ARNOLD.

No life experience of Elizabeth would seem at all complete without a
chapter giving a somewhat connected view of her _companion_, near a
half century by her side, in her toils, liberality, and church work.
Did she, when driven by persecution from her father's house, take up,
under stress of calamity, an inferior associate for life? Let us see. If,
as many claim, the wisest matches are founded on contrast, this
must have been _par excellence_.

For if we except their large size and mutual endowment of sound common
sense, there was very little natural similarity. In Connecticut the
farms of the Arnolds and the Wards joined, and yet they were not intimate
as families, for there was, for that day, too great disparity in property
and style. Both were moral and intelligent, but the large Arnold
family on the hill, though in comfortable circumstances, did not train
in the same "set" with the elegant establishment at the Cove.

Of the numerous family (of almost giant size) of Ebenezer and Anna Miller
Arnold there were only two sons.

Ebenezer, among the eldest, had the ancestral name, took to a mariner's
life, was a few years a sea captain, and lies at the bottom of the
ocean. Joshua was the youngest of the family, the almost idol of his
parents, and of a house full of lusty sisters, who vied with one another
which should teach him most and secure most of his confidence. So
he lived on until nearly thirty a bachelor. Such opportunities as were
afforded the common farmers' boys of New England in the eighteenth
century young Joshua diligently improved, and became a close student,
and well qualified as a teacher of common schools of his day.

His specialties were mathematics, penmanship, bookkeeping, business
science and forms, and navigation. And he continued to do more or less
in this profession until fifty years of age. He was converted among
the first fruits of Methodist labors in that part of New England.

Then, every Methodist studied closely into her doctrines, and this
young man became qualified to state clearly, and ably defend, all that
was peculiar to that Church. The cast of his mind was logical, candid,
patient--he was never inclined to hasty conclusions.

He loved to dig deep, collect strong evidence, and wait till conclusions
were sound and inevitable.

His brethren soon marked him for the ministry, and so advised; but, with
his great modesty and high opinions of a divine call, he was not then,
and never was, satisfied that he had such an essential individual
commission.
Without a full consciousness of duty in the line of that awful responsibility,
this pious young man refused to look in that direction. He, however,
cherished a high sense of the honor involved in the confidence of
the Church, and felt impelled to lay himself out to do his best as
a private member.

Under the ministry of such able Methodist preachers as Asbury, Jesse Lee,
and George Roberts, young Joshua had imbibed the main doctrines
of theology, and set out in earnest to "search the Scriptures,"
both "for correction" if wrong, and for confirmation in the truth he
had received and experienced. Thus fairly started on the King's highway
of truth, he became profoundly interested in Bible study; and
continued both the study and the intense love of it through life.
He dug in this mine more than a third of a century without any human
commentary, and found, to his great joy, that the poet had struck it:
"God is his own interpreter, and He will make it plain."

So diligently did he search for the "interpretation of Scripture by
Scripture," that he largely learned the doctrinal Scriptures by heart,
and also book, chapter, and verse; and to family and friends he was
"both concordance and commentary."
Near the middle of his experience and biblical research Mr. Arnold was
urged, almost driven, to take license to exhort, and more publicly
divulge some of the treasures of his years of study.

He had thus "improved in public" (as exhorting was then called) but a
year or two when his brethren, finding more of the expository than
hortatory in his discourses, urged that his proper office was that of
a local preacher. But to this he had two objections: lack of a distinct
call, and a settled fear that the Church was growing too numerous a
secular ministry; so he utterly refused.

For the balance of his active life, as health and opportunity
permitted, he "preached many things to the people in his exhortations,"
always laying for them a solid doctrinal foundation, and plentifully
using Scripture language, both accurately quoted and wisely applied, and
book and chapter usually given. His appointments for exhortation never
lacked attendants or interest; and when called, as he often was, to
"supply the appointment" of a circuit preacher, the substitute was
not met with wry faces nor spoken of in frowns.

Yet his highest apparent successes in speaking, if estimated by the
excitement, were his brief speeches in love feast, not boisterous,
but invariably stirring the deep of the heart of the meeting.

Joshua Arnold's singing was no way superior in kind and had no
marked defect, unless it was that time sometimes yielded to sentiment.

But the amount of psalm singing done in a half century by this peaceful
man was certainly marvelous.

The leading of most of the hymns in the social meetings was a very small
proportion of it. Whenever he found a psalm, a hymn, or a chorus that
struck a chord in his devout heart he laid it carefully away in his
retentive memory, and it was instantly called up when he wanted to
sing it.

But what was most noteworthy in his singing was that his happy heart, and
soft, sweet voice, and abundant store of pious psalmody kept him singing
wherever and whenever he could with propriety.

Mr. Arnold was the opposite of a business sharper. He was a moderate,
patient toiler, but traded no more than he was obliged to, and always
with frank, honest words, and very few words. He hated extortion,
avoided debt, and threw nothing away in interest or in lawsuits, and was
both careful and skillful in maintaining a good influence.

Like his wife, he was economical and liberal; and the Christian
liberality of their home knew no bounds but the limit of their means; nor
was that limit dreaded, nor often, if ever, found, when it embarrassed
the case on hand.

As Joshua Arnold was no ordinary man, so his _personnel_ was rather
peculiar: nearly six feet in height; large, but not fat; wore a
shoe of size number twelve, and hat size seven and a half.

His eye was blue, large, and mild; forehead broad and high; nose long and
straight; lips long and thin; mouth and chin small and delicate; hair
brown, fine, straight, and complexion florid. His motions were moderate,
and temper very steady and mild.

CHAPTER III.

SEPARATION.

But this aged couple were to share their joys and sorrows in their
retirement but a few years. Joshua was the first called away. He died
in his seventy-seventh year, in peace with God and all men. Just before
his speech failed one of his sons inquired how long he had been in the
Methodist Episcopal Church. His answer came slowly but firmly:
"Fifty-two years ago I said to this people, 'Whither thou goest, I will
go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people,
and thy God my God: where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be
buried.'

'The word hath passed my lips, and I Shall with thy people live and
die.'"
And the good man had the desire of his heart.

Elizabeth was now a widow, and had nearly reached her "threescore and
ten years." She was not much bent with age, though "compassed with
infirmity." She still found some little to do among the sick, the poor,
and the perishing, and was not gloomy or desponding in her loneliness.
She wrote much to her scattered children, who were too distant to
be seen often, and her letters breathed the spirit of heaven.

When possible to attend the preaching of the word she was "not a forgetful
hearer," but kept up her old method of prayerful abstraction. She had
during her whole religious life followed it.

She would early enter the meeting as if she saw no one and go solemnly
to her seat, and either kneel or cover her face for a time, and
thence on until the voice of the opening service aroused her would
be absorbed in devotion. As long as able to attend, her voice was heard
in prayer and class meetings; and many came to her room for counsel
and help in their experience.

It was marvelous to see what a change retirement and its quiet had
wrought in the spirit and manner of this woman. The drive and hum of
busy life were over; a heavenly calm had ensued--solemn, serene,
peaceful--no agony of prayer, no ecstasy of spirit, no shouts of
transport, no fiery trials. Her infirmities accumulate, but still
she rejoices in sacred, hallowed peace.
She becomes a cripple, almost confined to her bed, and continues so for
years; but her mind retains its strength and serenity, and her whole
heart rejoices in God, her immovable Rock.

The last decade or more of her life was marked as a continual feast upon
the holy word of God. She learned what her blessed Saviour meant
when he quoted and sanctioned that Scripture, "Man shall not live by
bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God," and also, his promise that the Holy Comforter should quote to
the faithful such passages of the word they had studied as their
circumstances might require.

So every day, and usually oftener, the Lord would give her a "passage to
feed upon," "day by day her daily bread." On the last day that she
could speak her pastor's wife inquired after her "passage for that day,"
and she instantly quoted Josh. i. 5, and Heb. xiii, 5, "I will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee."

Just before her speech failed her she called to her a daughter-in-law
and gave her a minute account of her graveclothes, which had been ready
for several years, and she found everything as she had described them.
Thus, as "a shock of corn fully ripe," she was at length gathered home.
She died in Fulton, Oswego County, N. Y., in August, 1865, in the
eighty-eighth year of her age, and in the seventieth year of
her religious experience, and is buried by the side of her husband in
Mount Adna Cemetery, where they together await the resurrection of
the just.

CHAPTER IV.

CONCLUSION.
The "disinherited" Elizabeth was never restored to her rights and
heirship as a daughter. As old age came upon that rigid father he
partially relented and doled out a few hundreds to her where his
other children had their thousands.
He even sent to Massachusetts for her to visit him on his deathbed
and counsel him concerning salvation, and pray with him; and he
indulged some hope under her prayers; but he made no confession of
his wrongs to her, nor amends for his injustice.
Her two brothers and three sisters all credited their religious
experience to God's blessing upon Elizabeth's prayers, counsels,
and life; but only one of them ever undertook to restore what the
father had taken from Elizabeth's right and given to her, and she
did not do it until she was about to die without issue. With one
voice they freely condemned her disinheritance and the persecutions
she had had to suffer. But when, their souls being "ill at ease"
under the remembrance of her wrongs, they spoke to her on the subject
(for she would not introduce it), they would simply repeat, "Father
so willed it, and you know, dear sister, that no one could ever
turn him."
All became church members, and so lived and died, but all in Calvinian
communions; while all of Elizabeth's children became Methodists,
and two of her sons, as we have seen, itinerant ministers. She and
her pious husband, as before stated, were industrious, economical,
and liberal, and Agar's prayer, "Give me neither poverty nor riches,"
was their prayer, and with its answer they walked happily and
usefully through life, "serving their generation by the will of
God," and passing in peace to their reward.

THE END.She was quick and quiet in filling an
order, and modest and self-possessed and sweet-tempered. She did her
work well and used her leisure well, and she deserved great praise. But
in her case this was the best work open to her. She was a hopelessly
dull scholar, and she was awkward with her needle. Nor did she have the
kind of mind necessary to direct others. She could not have conducted a
boarding-house. She could, however, do her own little bit of work well.
Now what was fine in her would not have been fine in the teacher. To be
sure, it is a pity to teach if one hates it, more of a pity than to do
some mechanical work, because there is danger that the feeling may react
upon the scholars. Still, this woman had the necessary self-control to
do this good work. On the other hand, she was not attracted to any
inferior work for its own sake. She would have made an excellent
duchess. Her talents as well as her tastes fitted her for such a life.
But she had to earn her living, and so far as she or her friends could
see there was no direction in which she could work without finding it
intolerable. And so it seems to me she did right to choose the best work
open to her and do it as well as she could, and I think if she had
forsaken the school-room for the restaurant she would not have done what
was best either for herself or for others.

I have known an ignorant woman who kept a lodging-house with such
devotion that it was like a work of art. Its purity and freshness, its
warmth and light had a charm beyond that of comfort. Such work is to be
done, and it is not often done well, because the woman who does it is
below rather than above her task. "Let the great soul incarnated in some
woman's form, poor and sad and single, in some Dolly or Joan, go out to
service, and sweep chambers and scour floors, and its effulgent day
beams cannot be muffled or hid, but to sweep and scour will instantly
appear supreme and beautiful actions, the top and radiance of human
life, and all people will get mops and brooms; until lo, suddenly the
great soul has enshrined itself in some other form and done some other
deed, and that is now the flower and head of all living nature."

The lower work must be done, and often by the highest natures. It must
then be done willingly and with a recognition that it can be made a work
of art. But it should be deliberately chosen only by those to whom it is
the highest work. I have in mind a young man who might have been a
musician, but he would not practice, so he became a shoemaker. He had to
work harder as a shoemaker than he would have done as a musician, but it
was from hand to mouth. He did not have to work steadily towards a
future good. He had no gift but that of music, so that even if he had
been a musician he would have ranked far lower in the scale of manhood
than the shoemakers of the village; but he would have done the best he
could do, while as a shoemaker he was despicable.

I knew a good teacher, capable of taking responsibility, who hated it so
that she gave up work the moment she had acquired a miserable pittance.
She lived ever after a pinched life, whose chief source of happiness to
herself was the negative satisfaction of escaping responsibility; for
she was too poor to gratify any of her many beautiful tastes. She had
the power to lead a large, full life, but she had not the will and
courage to meet the obstacles in her way. She chose instead to stunt
herself and be a drudge. She swept her poor rooms clean, and she was
willing to sweep them, but I do not think she "swept them as to God's
law," for though she often made them "fine," I do not think she made
"the action fine."

But such a case is rare. More people choose work too high for them. We
all like to think we have some touch of genius, though we may be
discreet enough not to say so. But few of us have talents at all equal
to our tastes, and we must beware of trying to get our livelihood in the
direction of our tastes rather than of our talents.

One girl in ten thousand has the voice of a _prima donna_. Ten other
girls in ten thousand have voices so good that they believe them to be
like that of a _prima donna_. The first will succeed beyond her wildest
dreams. She will have fame and fortune. The other ten will have some
success, success which will seem great to the lookers on, but they will
have heart-breaking disappointments within their own breasts. A hundred
girls in the ten thousand have more talent for music than for most other
things, and if they are well educated, they may perhaps make a good
living as teachers, church singers, organists, or accompanists. This is
not what they hoped, but they do the work that belongs to them, and on
the whole may be counted successful. Another hundred like music, and can
learn enough to add to their enjoyment and to that of those about them.
They might even teach music, if the demand for teachers were not already
filled by those who have a greater gift. But now it is clear their bread
must depend on other work for which they have less taste. These are the
"betwixt and between" who are always fighting a battle between taste and
talent. They have a compensation,--they are less one-sidedly developed
than if all their talents were concentrated in one; but they hardly
realize this.

Now, how is the line to be drawn among the musical? Who are to earn
their living by music and who are to be amateurs? She could have had a
Court of Virgins, or gone like Artemis, buskined through the thickets,
with a hundred high-girdled nymphs behind her, all for her sake locked
in chastity. They also made her presents, which her father sold, until
(learning to fear the Greeks, their brothers), she gently forbore
them.
Whereupon, the honest stone-mason had fresh cause for chastisement of so
incalculably calculating a child.

The hunted fair at last came to a point where she must stand or
deliver.
From three desperate lovers there seemed no sure road. All that was
possible she did.

She consulted her priest; he patted her cheek. A very old woman of her
intimacy advised her to look in the glass; she did, and blushed at
her own distressful face. A friar of the order of Saint Francis plumply
told her to choose the most solid of her pursuers and make the most
of him. "Such roses as yours, my daughter," said he, "should
be early to market. You are sixteen now; but remember that by the mercy
of Heaven you may live to be six and sixty. That's the time when the
pot wants lining. If you have not the experience, pray how are you to
direct the young in the way they should go?

Yet that is the trade for an old lady whose life has been an easy one. For
my part, I regret that the rules of our convent do not allow me to
open the gate."
She pouted, and went out into the sun again, to find her way to the
Santo barred.

The three poets, with three lutes, were singing a madrigal in her honour.
They were understood to say that her going was over the tired bodies of
lovers, that she went girdled with red hearts, that her breast
was cold ivory, and her own heart carved in ice. _Nymph_ rhymed with
_lymph_ and _Ippolita_ with _insolita_; the whole, ingenious as it
was, was not _ad rem_; and as for the poor subject of it all, her
heart (far from being ice) was hot with mutiny. She knew herself for a
simpleton--just a poor girl; she knew herself made ridiculous by this
parade; could see herself as she was. Her crisping hair was over her
ears and knotted behind her neck, without garland or fillet or so much
as a brass pin; her green dress, though it was low in the neck,
was tightly drawn over her bust; for what were glorious to be shown
in a great lady, in her had been an immodesty.

When she lifted her skirt out of the gutter you could see some inches
of bare leg. Her hands were brown with work, though her neck was like
warm marble in the sun. Eh, she knew herself through and through
just a low-born wench; and "O Gesù
Rè!" her heart cried within her, "why can they not leave me alone!"
The three poets--Stazio Orsini in white and yellow, Alessandro del Dardo
in white and green, and Meleagro de' Martiri in a plum-coloured
cloak--accompanied her down the Via Pozzo Depinto to her poor house
in the quarter of Santa Caterina; she lived in the Vicolo Agnus Dei.

To their florid exercises in the language of courts she replied in
monosyllables--"Sissignore," "Grazie, Signore," or "Servo suo"; the
humble words were as much her daily use as _Padre nostro_ or _Ave
Maria_. At the door she must have her hand kissed three times in face
of the nudging neighbours; and to each salute her honesty prompted a
fresh "Grazie, Signore," a curtsy, and a profound blush. Meleagro beat
his forehead to see her so lovely and so unapproachable; Orsini bit his
lip; but Alessandro, mindful of his nails, and not to be Sub-Prefect for
nothing, went away to find the girl's father.

This worthy bowed to the earth before his visitor.

In what way could His Excellency be served? By the acceptance, on Matteo's
part, of twenty ducats? Benissimo, e tante grazie!

"Matteo," said the Sub-Prefect when this little transfer was
accomplished, "your daughter is the most beautiful lady in all this
city of Padua."
"She is a choice thing, I own it," said the good Matteo; "and how dear to
her old father your honour hath no notion."
"I can very well imagine it," returned Messer Alessandro; "and,
indeed, I remember that you are twenty ducats in hand."

"Oh, va bene, va bene!" cried Matteo. "I am your Excellency's humble
servant. You shall take her when you like and as you like."
"All will be done scrupulously," Alessandro said with fervour. "We
shall crown her Queen of our College of the Muses; she shall be priestess,
sacred image, and oracle; and most honourably served."
"Honour of course," said Matteo, "comes into the game. I have played
it myself, and know what I am talking about. There was Beppina, that
fat Venetian hussy--to see her eat! But she always had her whack.

Eh, I have been a blade in my day!"
To this testimony the Sub-Prefect had no comments ready. He returned
to the object of his thought.

"We shall in turn contemplate her excellence," he explained, "and derive
inspirations in turn. A fine body of devotional rhyme should be
the result of this."
"The result," Matteo broke in, "will be a fine one, I warrant your
Excellency, if such things as that are in your mind--and call it
what you will, she's as healthy as ever her mother was.

And _she_ had seventeen of 'em, one way with another, before I buried
her."
"She shall be crowned with stars, rest upon beds of roses, walk in
flowery meadows, hide from the heat in thickets where water is--"
Alessandro went lilting on. "We will sing to her all day, and of her all
night. The saloon of the Villa Venusta shall depict the story of her
glorious arising."
"Pretty, pretty!" cried Matteo, "I see that your honour knows the rules
of play.

Now when shall the game begin?"
"My honest friend, the litter will be at your door come daybreak," said
Alessandro. "Three noble ladies will attend Madonna to bathe and dress
her. After that, you shall leave her safely in our keeping."
Matteo bowed. "Excellency, I am your servant. Everything shall be as you
wish."
He did not add, though he might well have added, that it was more than
himself had dared to hope for.

At time of sunset home he came, but not to beat his beautiful daughter.
On the contrary, he made much of her. Fuddled he was, but not drunk.
He took her incontinent upon his knee and began to deal in rather liberal
innuendo. Divining him darkly, she went to work with such arts as
she had to wheedle the worst out of him.

"Carissimo padre,"--so she coaxed him, with hands interwoven about his
scrubby face,--"tell me more of this gallantry of young blades."
"Chuck, chuck, chuck," he babbled, oozing wine, "come and feed out of
my hand. Bill me, sweeting, and I bill thee. Ho, ho! Two doves on
a branch!
What, turtle? Wilt thou mope for ever?"
She trembled. "Nay, nay, I'll mope no more, father," says she.

"But do thou tell me who my mate is to be."
Slyly he looked at her burning face and slyly kissed it. Then he
began to sing--

"Quell' drudo, Messer Amore, Ha scelto un Dardo per cuore!
Dardo acerbo, ardente, Che fa gridare le genti-- Ohimè! Dolce dolore!"

She had been a fool indeed to miss such a rebus. So the peril was worse
than her dread! The lees of twenty ducats shabby in his fist told her
how near the peril was.

Going to bed, he folded her in his arms, making her prop while he mumbled
comfort.

"It is all for the best, my beauty-bright," he hiccoughed, "all clearly
for the best. Messer Alessandro is a lover in ten thousand. I shall be
as good as a father-in-law any day of the week.

Why, it's 'My honest friend' that he hails me already! That is
what a man may call climbing up, I hope, when a poetical roaring blade
cuts out your 'servo suo' in that fashion. And he's Sotto-Prefetto,
remember. That means all Padua yours for the asking. Sleep sound,
my pretty bird, Ippolita bella! After this night you shall sleep by
day." So he found, by good luck, his bed, and she a time for tears.

III
THE JEW IN THE VIA DELLA GATTA

If there is not much to be said for the Via della Gatta in these
days, there was even less when Ippolita was the reigning toast. It was
cloistered (as now), it was cobbled, shabby-white, secret, blind; it
echoed silence, was a place for slippering crones, for furtive
cats, and the smell of garlic and charcoal fires.

Of nights, by the same token, it was not the place to choose for
an after-supper walk. The watch used to go through it with swords before
and daggers behind. Lanterns were little use save to reveal the
cut-throat blackness all about.

Now, on the very night when Matteo was fuddled, Ippolita in tears,
Alessandro in a fever, and the more reputable Padovani turning down
their beds, the watch came rattling at the Sub-Prefect's door to
report a dead Jew in the Via della Gatta. Of all nights in the year,
this, the eve of the Glorious Ippolita's home-bringing, to be vexed by
a dead Jew!
Messer Alessandro was exceedingly annoyed.

"Take your accursèd Jew," he said to the lieutenant, "and stuff him
underground. I am busy, I am absorbed in work. When I have leisure I will
attend to him. You can dig him up again. And I take this opportunity
to tell you, Lieutenant, that your visit is most inopportune. For six
months you have brought me nothing of the sort, and to-night,
for example, you plump a Jew on my doorstep. Bury your beastly Jew and
leave me in peace."
"But, Excellency," stammered the Lieutenant, "your Excellency will see
that I have no control over the assassins of Padua.

This Jew has not died happily. There is a great hole under his ribs. He
is scarcely cold yet."
"That is soon remedied," said Alessandro; "put him in the ground."
"But, Excellency, a murdered Jew, a Jew in holes--"
"The Jews have been damned from the beginning of our dispensation,"
cried the Sub-Prefect in a rage.

"Well, I add my malediction. I say, Damn your Jew!" And he shut the door
in the face of the watch.

The Lieutenant was hungry. If his chief could damn the Jews, so could
he.

"Corporal," says he, "I am going to supper. Do what you like with the
Jew, so long as you put him decently away when you have finished. Good
night."
The Corporal conferred with his men.

Here was the Jew--what should they do with him? One of the archers suggested
a source of profit. He might be shown in the wine-shops at a quattrino a
head. Agreed. Off they set.

They showed him at the Codalunga--there were some low-browed hovels
there, as was usual about the gates: the Jew did well. Thence they
skirted the walls by the Riviera Santa Sofia, tried him at the outer
gate of the Carmine, worked their way from tavern to tavern, till
they came to the Vicolo Agnus Dei. It was a thousand pities Matteo was
drunk in his bed; he had quattrini enough and would not have missed
the treat for the world.

Ippolita, whimpering in hers, wondered what the buzzing and sliding
of shoes in the street below could be about. She had troubles of her own,
poor girl, but she could not stand this. Up she got: a single glance
out of window was enough. She shuffled on a shift and a petticoat,
snatched a shawl, and tiptoed out. Annina, her bosom friend, had no
troubles. She was half undressed, but she too slipped a shawl over her
head and went peering into the alley. There she met Ippolita, and joined
hands. Flaring torches, a swarm of eager black heads, whispers,
grunting, the archers' plumed helmets--"Madonna! What's all this?"
cried the two girls together in a stew of curiosity. A dead Jew? A
murdered Jew? O Gesù! They borrowed a quattrino apiece from a
neighbour and were richly rewarded.

Ah, the blood, the staring, his grey old fingers!

There was a something, if you like, to talk about at the house door;
and a something to dream of, per Bacco!

I believe the Jew engulfed all her annoyances of the past and all her
fret over the immediate future.

When they had done with him, came the question of his interment. It
was the small hours, very near the time to relieve guard. The Jew's
hosts found themselves out by the Porta Santa Croce--an empty
quarter of the town, abounding in gardens.

"Over the wall with him," said the Corporal; "we'll plant him here."
It was done. The Jew, who, by the look of him, had earned more money an
hour after death than in all the years of his life, was put a foot and a
half underground among the pumpkins in a garden of the Via di Vanzo.

Padua went to sleep.

IV
IPPOLITA LIFTS UP HER EYES TO THE HILLS
Waking from a late troubled sleep, Ippolita found her little room
possessed by three noble ladies--Emilia Malaspina, Euforbia di
Ponterotto, and Domenica di Campodarsego--dressed all in saffron
and white (her sacred colours, they told her), who announced
themselves, with much kneeling and folding of arms over breasts,
as her handmaids.

"Sagro cuor di Gesù!" thought poor Ippolita, "what a way to undo me!"
But aloud she only murmured, "Tante grazie, gentildonne," and got
out of bed.

They had prepared for her a scented bath, into which, in her dazed
condition, she entered without overmuch persuasion.

True, she thought to find her death in so much water, and crossed
herself vehemently when first it touched her back; but there might be
worse deaths (she supposed) than drowning for a poor girl bought and
sold, and not so very long ago a Jew had been baptized in Santa Giustina
in water up to his neck. Nothing, however, would induce her to sit
down. They dressed her then in silk, tied and garlanded her hair, put a
gold chain round her neck, silken shoes on her feet--talking in quick
whispers to each other all the time; and so announced with curtsies
that she might enter the litter as soon as she would.

She was at the disposition of these ladies, was her faltered reply.
Emilia waved her hand out of the little window; chords of music sounded
from the street; the voices of men and ladies rose upon a madrigal--
"Fior' di Maggio--Soave, pio e saggio--Salve, Ippolita!"--the work of
Alessandro's muse upon that night of discord from the Jew. So she went
downstairs.

The Vicolo Agnus Dei--a blind alley of low jutting houses over arcades,
full of squalor, pink wash, children, and cats--was on this early
morning ablaze with colour and music. From wall to wall (and eight
feet will measure that) it seemed packed with the nobility. Tousled heads
from above looked down curiously on heads elaborately frizzed, on
scarlet caps, on plumes, on garlands, on jewelled necks. Poverty and
riches touch at their extremes, like houses in the South. The shoulders
of the ladies at play were no barer than those of the slatterns who
gaped at them playing; but for Ippolita, who had always been a decent
girl, let us hope her blushes were a cloak. She felt naked. And the
bath, remember, had unnerved her.

What these neighbours of hers may have thought is no concern of ours, since
the actors in the play took no concern in it. Twenty pieces of silver
had bought an incomparable peg for their conceits. They were
rescuing, they said to each other, a lily from the gutter, taking a
jewel from a dirty finger, glorifying the glories--a pious act which
could not fail of returning honour to those who took honour in doing
it. The people! Sacks to be filled with garlic and black wine, liver
and blood-puddings--grunting hogs, let them keep their sty.

Let them not dare (and in truth it never occurred to them to dare)
interfere with the diversions of the great. Yet as the veiled sacrifice
went to mount the litter, one brown-eyed rascal from an upper window,
holding a towel over her neck, shrilled out in homely patois, "A
vederti, 'Polita mia!" and Ippolita turned her lovely head and showed
for a moment her shining wet eyes to those who watched. She smiled
tenderly at the send-off, but "Addio, Annina, addio!" she said softly,
and turned bowing to her bowing gaolers.

As the swaying litter of gold and white went out into the Pozzo Depinto
and turned up towards the Pontecorbo Gate; as the music and
chanting--"Candida Ippolita, premio d'Amore! Grazia insolita del sommo
Fattore!"--died away to a murmurous underflow of sound, perhaps a tongue
or two was thrust into a cheek or two, perhaps a bare shoulder
shrugged or one shock-head wagged to another.

The air was sharp, beds still warm--whose business was it? The
street was left to the rats and snuffing dogs again.

But Annina had sparks of fire in her brown eyes, and panted as she
tugged at her staylaces. It was not long before she clattered downstairs
on her clacking heels, and went to mark the cage they had gilded
for her dear Ippolita.

Those hierophants, that Collegio d'Amore (as the new style ran), bearing
in their midst the garlanded victim--Goddess at once and
Sacrifice--awoke the echoes of the streets without comment.

The city gates were open, it is true; in some churches the doors stood
wide for the first mass; they passed a priest or so just up, a friar
or so, furtive truants from their beds; then, at the edge of the Piazza
del Santo, Ippolita peeping through her curtains saw a little
company of goatherds, blanketted, brown-legged, shabby rogues, their
feet white with country dust, new in from the hills with their flocks.
They blinked to see the gay procession; but wistfully, longingly,
she looked after them from her cage.

They were not so much market-stuff, per Dio! They walked at large over
bright hillsides, singing to the sky and the winds.
They were not pestered with love or fine buzzing ladies or capering
signori, who larded poor girls with compliments, and showed their teeth
most when they meant least. Ah, if she could run away! If she could hide
with them, lie on the hillsides while the goats cropped about her; lie
on her back, her hands a pillow, and sing to the sky and the winds
because she was so happy!

The thought possessed her; she ached for freedom; felt the water of
desire hot in her mouth. The sleepy shepherds huddled in their rags
watched her go by; they little knew what a craving the sight of their
dusty ease had stirred in a heart whose covering was fine silk and
strung pearls. Her wrongs came back upon her like heaped waters
of a flood. That shameful bath--ah, Soul of Christ, to strip one naked,
and let souse in hot water, like a pig whose bristles must come
off! More than songs which she did not understand, more than compliments
which made her feel foolish and pictures which made her look
so, was this refined indignity. Seethed in water like a dead pig--ah,
Madonna! She arrived sulky--if so humble-minded a girl could be
sulky; defiant, suspicious, at least.

The place chosen for the new Collegio d'Amore was the Villa Venusta,
whose shady garden can still be seen from the Riviera Businello. This
garden is full of trees, myrtle, wisteria, lilac, acacia--flowering
trees--with a complement of firs and shining laurel to give a setting to
so much golden-green and white.

It has a canal on two sides, is a deep, leafy place, where nightingales
sing day and night; it abounds in grass lawns, flowers, weeping trees,
and marble _hermæ_. The villa itself is very stately, a three-storied
house in the Venetian style, from whose upper windows you can
command a fine stretch of country; below you on either hand the
Piazza del Santo, the Prato della Valle, with their enormous churches,
pink and grey; beyond these the city walls, the green plain; lastly,
the ragged outline of the far distant hills.

It has a courtyard with lemon trees, long, dim rooms empty of all but
coolness, shuttered against the glare of noon; above, a great saloon
coffered in the ceiling, frescoed on the walls, with a dais and a throne;
an open loggia full of flowers; above all this again, raftered
bedrooms smelling of lavender. A roomy, stately place for those whose
lives move easily in such surroundings; for Ippolita, the girl of the
people, happy in her dark tenement in the Vicolo, gossip of the
upper windows, shy beckoner to the street, burnisher of doorposts
at sundown--for Ippolita this windy great house was a prison, neither
more nor less.

It was a prison, at least, conducted according to the best rules of
gallantry then obtaining. They bowed her up the staircase to the
refectory: they sat her down and plied her on their knees with fruit and
cups of wine. They led her to the throne room, where, high above them
all, she was to sit, and (being crowned) hear them contend in verse and
prose for the privilege of her love for the day.

It was all arranged.
She was to have a favourite every day, man or maid. Favour was to go by
merit among her slaves. The theme was always to be her incomparable
virtues--her beauty, discretion, wit (poor dumb fish!)

, her shining chastity, power of binding and loosing by one soft blue ray
from her eyes, etc. They displayed her emblems on the walls--the
peacock, because her beauty was her pride, her pride her beauty;
doves, because they were Aphrodite's birds; rabbits, because the artist
understood rabbits; the beaver, that glorious witness of virtue, who
makes himself less certainly a beaver that he may be more safely a
saint; the beaver, I say, in white on a green field. Other symbols--the
lily of her candour, the rose of her glowing cheeks, the crocus of her
hair, the pink anemones which were her toes, the almond for her
fingers: she saw herself articulated; her fauna, her flora, her
moral and physical attributes cried at her from the four walls.

Ippolita sat very scared on her throne, and endured what she could by
catching firmly to the knobs of it and blinking her eyes. One by one
they came creeping, these silken ladies, these slashed and curled
young lords, to kiss her hand. "Dio mio!" thought she. "What is all this
about? And are maids courted this way among the great?"

She knew very little about it, yet was quite sure they were not. She
wondered when Alessandro's business was going to begin. As a matter
of fact, it _had_ begun. He was now removing several inches of
superfluous finger-nail with a sword.

For the first day that same Alessandro del Dardo won her to himself by
his descant upon the theme, "How a gentleman may dismember himself without
dishonour for a lady's love; and how not."
"Now he has me," thought poor Ippolita, and set her teeth. But he
lay at her feet most of the day, and though at night he led her
into the garden, if you will believe me, he never even kissed her
hand.
"Who is mad?" thought she to herself, staring from her bed into the
shadowy angles of the room. "Am I mad? Are these signori all mad?
Is this a mad-house? Dio! it soon should be at this rate." She cried
herself to sleep at last.
Next day it was Meleagro who won her by a careful consideration of
the question, "Whether or no, when a gentleman has served a lady
for ten years, and she falls sick of the small-pox, he is _ipso
facto_ absolved of his vow?" Meleagro decided that he was not, and
was accepted by Ippolita, not because she admired his reasoning but
because she thought it part of the game.
Next came the turn of Donna Emilia, a very burning poetess, for a
Sapphic ode; and so on and so on. After three days Ippolita found
herself yawning her head off; the longing for freedom returned, for
the open country, the hills, the goatherds. Not for her home in the
Vicolo:
this everlasting love-making with its aftertaste of stale sugar had
turned her sick of Padua. The whole city, to her mind, reeked of
bergamot; she guessed a fawning lover at every street corner, a
pryer at every window--basta, basta, la città!
No: it was to the hills she lifted up her eyes, to the hills and
the swart goatherds free of their mystery. That _riviera_ across
the canal, where the budding planes made a mist of brown and rose,
was a favourite haunt of theirs. There they assembled and milked
their goats, thence set out homewards at night. Sitting in the
pleached arbours, with two adoring ladies at her feet and a little
cluster of youths behind and beside her, she used to peer long and
earnestly through the branches to see them collect their flocks and
start for the hills at dusk. Lithe, brown, sinewy lads they were!
What long legs they had, with what bravery wore their ragged cloaks!
One carried a great bulging skin under his arm--bagpipes! She was
sure they made good music to each other in the green country places.
Very early in the morning she heard them come in; they were known
by their bells. She jumped out of her luxurious bed at the first
tinkle, and was at the shutter watching for them before ever they
rounded the angle of the Ponte della Morte.I know a girl with a fine
intellect who loves to study, but who cannot quite give herself up to
study because she is haunted by the feeling that in this way she is
concentrating her life on herself. It is true there are learned women
who are very selfish, but it is not true that their learning makes them
so, certainly it is not, if they think and judge as well as learn. This
girl believes she ought to visit the poor, and some time she may do some
good in that way; but her natural aptitude is in another direction. If
she ever succeeds in so disciplining her intellect that she has just
views of life, she will have it in her power to exert a wide influence.
If she could, for instance, convince her imperious father and brothers
that there was something to be said on the side of their striking
workmen, she would indirectly do the poor more good than she could ever
do directly. Perhaps she could convince them. One reason that her father
is so eager to grind men down is because her mother is frivolous and
extravagant.

I call to mind a girl who has been studying art abroad for some years.
She has talent enough to earn her living by her work, if that were
necessary. As it is not, she has chosen to do a fine thing. She has made
copies of many of the great paintings of the world, and she has given
these to the quiet boarding-school where she was educated. These
corrections have been made silently; all other corrections and additions
are indicated by footnotes enclosed in square brackets.

V. NOTES.

1.

_The Tournament_, lines 7-10.

Wythe straunge depyctures, Nature maie nott yeelde, &c.

'This is neither sense nor grammar as it stands' says Professor Skeat.
But Chatterton is frequently ungrammatical, and the sense of the passage
is quite clear if either of the two following possible meanings is
attributed to _unryghte_.

(1)=to present an intelligible significance otherwise than by writing--as
'rebus'd shields' do (un-write);
or (2) = to misrepresent (un-right).

With pictures of strange beasts that have no counterpart in Nature and
appear to be purely fantastic ('unseemly to all order') yet none
the less make known to men good at guessing riddles ('who thyncke and
have a spryte') what the strange heraldic forms
express-without-use-of-written-words ('unryghte')--or (taking the second
meaning of unryghte--misrepresent) present-with-a-disregard-of-truth-to-nature.

2. _Letter to the Dygne Mastre Canynge_, line 15.

Seldomm, or never, are armes vyrtues mede, (that is to say, coats of arms)
Shee nillynge to take myckle aie dothe hede
i.e. 'She unwilling to take much aye doth heed'; 'which is nonsense' says
Prof. Skeat. But the sentence is an example of ellipse, a figure which
Chatterton affected a good deal, and fully expressed would run 'She--not
willing to take much, ever doth heed not to take much', which would of
course be intolerably clumsy but perfectly intelligible.

3. _Ælla_, line 467.

Certis thie wordes maie, thou motest have sayne &c.

Prof. Skeat 'can make nothing of this' and reads 'Certes thy wordes
mightest thou have sayn'.

A simple emendation of _maie_ to _meynte_ would give very good sense.

4. _Ælla_, line 489.

Tyrwhitt has _sphere_--evidently a mistake in the MS. for _spere_
which he overlooked.

It is not included in his errata. In the 1842 edition the meaning 'spear'
is given in a footnote.

5. _Englysh Metamorphosis_.

Prof. Skeat was the first to point out that this piece is an imitation
of _The Faerie Queene_, Bk. ii, Canto X, stanzas 5-19.

6. _Battle of Hastings_, II, line 578.

To the ourt arraie of the thight Saxonnes came 
Prof.

Skeat explains _ourt_ as 'overt' and observes that it contradicts _thight_,
which he renders 'tight'. But really there is not even an antithesis.
_Ourt arraie_ is what a military handbook calls 'open order' and _thight_
is 'well-built', well put together (Bailey's Dictionary). The Saxons
were well-built men marching in open order.

VI. APPENDIX.

BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE ARGUMENTS USED IN THE ROWLEY CONTROVERSY.

(Taken mainly from Gregory's _Life of Chatterton_.)

_Against Rowley_.

1. So few originals produced--not more than 124 verses.

2. Chatterton had shown (by his article on Christmas games, &c.) that he
had a strong turn for antiquities. He had also written poetry. Why then
should he not have written Rowley's poems?

3. His declaration that the _Battle of Hastings_ I was his own.

4. Rudhall's testimony.

5. Chatterton first exhibited the _Songe to Ælla_ in his own handwriting,
then gave Barrett the parchment, which contained strange textual
variations.

6. Rowley's very existence doubtful.

William of Worcester, who lived at his time and was himself of Bristol,
makes no mention of him, though he frequently alludes to Canynge. Neither
Bale, Leland, Pitts nor Turner mentions Rowley.

7. Improbability of there being poems in a muniment chest. 8. Style unlike
other fifteenth century writings.

9. No mediæval learning or citation of authority to be found in Rowley;
no references to the Round Table and stories of chivalry.

10. Stockings were not knitted in the fifteenth century (_Ælla_). MSS.
are referred to as if they were rarities and printed books common.

11. Metres and imitation of Pindar absurdly modern.

12. Mistakes cited which are derived from modern dictionaries (Tyrwhitt).

13. Existence of undoubted plagiarisms from Shakespeare, Gray,
&c.

_For Rowley_.

1.

Chatterton's assertion that they were Rowley's, his sister having
represented him as a 'lover of truth from the earliest dawn of reason.'

2. Catcott's assertion that Chatterton on their first acquaintance had
mentioned by name almost all the poems which have since appeared in print
(Bryant).

3. Smith had seen parchments in the possession of Chatterton,
some as broad as the bottom of a large-sized chair.

(Bryant.)
4. Even Mr. Clayfield and Rudhall believed Chatterton incapable of
composing Rowley's poems.

5. Undoubtedly there were ancient MSS. in the 'cofre'.

6. Chatterton would never have had time to write so much. He did not neglect
his work in the attorney's office and he read enormously.

7. Chatterton made many mistakes in his transcription of Rowley and in
his notes to the poems. (Bryant's main contention.)
8. If Leland never mentioned Rowley it is equally true he says
nothing of Canynge, Lydgate, or Occleve.

_For Rowley_.

1. The poems contain much historical allusion at once true and
inaccessible to Chatterton.

2. The admitted poems are much below the standard of Rowley.

3. The old octave stanza is not far removed from the usual stanza
of Rowley.

4. If Rowley's language differs from that of other fifteenth century
writers, the difference lies in provincialisms natural to an inhabitant
of Bristol.

5. Plagiarisms from modern authors may in some cases have been introduced
by Chatterton but in others they are the commonplaces of poetry.

_Against Rowley_.

1. No writings or chest deposited in Redcliffe Church are mentioned in
Canynge's Will.

2.

The Bristol library was in Chatterton's time of general access, and
Chatterton was introduced to it by Rev.

A. Catcott (Warton).

3. Facts about Canynge may be found in his epitaph in Redcliffe Church;
and the account of Redcliffe steeple--(which had been destroyed
by fire before Chatterton's time) came from the bottom of an old
print published in 1746.

4.

The parchments were taken from the bottom of old deeds where a small
blank space was usually left--hence their small size.

PREFACE.

The Poems, which make the principal part of this Collection, have for some
time excited much curiosity, as the supposed productions of THOMAS ROWLEY,
a priest of Bristol, in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV. They are
here faithfully printed from the most authentic MSS that could be
procured; of which a particular description is given in the
_Introductory account of the several pieces contained in this
volume_, subjoined to this Preface.

Nothing more therefore seems necessary at present, than to inform the
Reader shortly of the manner in which these Poems were first brought
to light, and of the authority upon which they are ascribed to the persons
whose names they bear.

This cannot be done so satisfactorily as in the words of Mr. George
Catcott of Bristol, to whose very laudable zeal the Publick is indebted
for the most considerable part of the following collection.

His account of the matter is this: "The first discovery of certain MSS
having been deposited in Redclift church, above three centuries
ago, was made in the year 1768, at the time of opening the new bridge at
Bristol, and was owing to a publication in _Farley's Weekly Journal_,
1 October 1768, containing an _Account of the ceremonies observed
at the opening of the old bridge_, taken, as it was said, from a
very antient MS.

This excited the curiosity of some persons to enquire after the original.
The printer, Mr. Farley, could give no account of it, or of the person
who brought the copy; but after much enquiry it was discovered, that the
person who brought the copy was a youth, between 15 and 16 years
of age, whose name was Thomas Chatterton, and whose family had been
sextons of Redclift church for near 150 years.

His father, who was now dead, had also been master of the free-school in
Pile-street. The young man was at first very unwilling to discover
from whence he had the original; but, after many promises made to him,
he was at last prevailed on to acknowledge, that he had received this,
_together with many other MSS_, from his father, who had found them in a
large chest in an upper room over the chapel on the north side
of Redclift church."
Soon after this Mr. Catcott commenced his acquaintance with young
Chatterton[1], and, partly as presents partly as purchases, procured from
him copies of many of his MSS. in in prose and verse.

Other copies were disposed of, in the same way, to Mr. William Barrett,
an eminent surgeon at Bristol, who has long been engaged in writing the
history of that city. Mr. Barrett also procured from him several
fragments, some of a considerable length, written upon vellum[2], which
he asserted to be part of his original MSS.

In short, in the space of about eighteen months, from October
1768 to April 1770, besides the Poems now published, he produced as many
compositions, in prose and verse, under the names of Rowley, Canynge,
&c. as would nearly fill such another volume.

In April 1770 Chatterton went to London, and died there in the August
following; so that the whole history of this very extraordinary
transaction cannot now probably be known with any certainty. Whatever
may have been his part in it; whether he was the author, or only the
copier (as he constantly asserted) of all these productions; he
appears to have kept the secret entirely to himself, and not to
have put it in the power of any other person, to bear certain
testimony either to his fraud or to his veracity.

The question therefore concerning the authenticity of these Poems must
now be decided by an examination of the fragments upon vellum, which Mr.
Barrett received from Chatterton as part of his original MSS., and by
the internal evidence which the several pieces afford. If the Fragments
shall be judged to be genuine, it will still remain to be determined,
how far their genuineness should serve to authenticate the rest of
the collection, of which no copies, older than those made by
Chatterton, have ever been produced. On the other hand, if the writing
of the Fragments shall be judged to be counterfeit and forged by
Chatterton, it will not of necessity follow, that the matter of them
was also forged by him, and still less, that all the other
compositions, which he professed to have copied from antient MSS., were
merely inventions of his own. In either case, the decision must finally
depend upon the internal evidence.

It may be expected perhaps, that the Editor should give an opinion
upon this important question; but he rather chooses, for many reasons,
to leave it to the determination of the unprejudiced and intelligent
Reader. He had long been desirous that these Poems should be printed;
and therefore readily undertook the charge of superintending the edition.
This he has executed in the manner, which seemed to him best suited
to such a publication; and here he means that his task should end.

Whether the Poems be really antient, or modern; the compositions of Rowley,
or the forgeries of Chatterton; they must always be considered as a
most singular literary curiosity.

[Footnote 1: The history of this youth is so intimately connected with
that of the poems now published, that the Reader cannot be too early
apprized of the principal circumstances of his short life. He was born
on the 20th of November 1752, and educated at a charity-school on
St.
Augustin's Back, where nothing more was taught than reading, writing, and
accounts.

At the age of fourteen, he was articled clerk to an attorney, with whom
he continued till he left Bristol in April 1770.

Though his education was thus confined, he discovered an early turn towards
poetry and English antiquities, particularly heraldry. How soon he began
to be an author is not known. In the _Town and Country Magazine_ for
March 1769, are two letters, probably, from him, as they are dated at
Bristol, and subscribed with his usual signature, D.B.
The first contains short extracts from two MSS., "_written three
hundred years ago by one Rowley, a Monk_" concerning dress in the age
of Henry II; the other, "ETHELGAR, _a Saxon poem_" in bombast prose.
In the same Magazine for May 1769, are three communications from
Bristol, with the same signature, D.B. _viz_. CERDICK, _translated from
the Saxon_ (in the same style with ETHELGAR), p.
233.--_Observations upon Saxon heraldry_, with drawings of _Saxon
atchievements_, &c. p. 245.

--ELINOURE and JUGA, _written three hundred years ago by_ T. ROWLEY, _a
secular priest_, p. 273. This last poem is reprinted in this volume,
p. 19. In the subsequent months of 1769 and 1770 there are several
other pieces in the same Magazine, which are undoubtedly of his
composition.
In April 1770, he left Bristol and came to London, in hopes of
advancing his fortune by his talents for writing, of which, by this
time, he had conceived a very high opinion. In the prosecution of
this scheme, he appears to have almost entirely depended upon the
patronage of a set of gentlemen, whom an eminent author long ago
pointed out, as _not the very worst judges or rewarders of merit_,
the booksellers of this great city. At his first arrival indeed he
was so unlucky as to find two of his expected Mæcenases, the one
in the King's Bench, and the other in Newgate. But this little
disappointment was alleviated by the encouragement which he received
from other quarters; and on the 14th of May he writes to his mother,
in high spirits upon the change in his situation, with the following
sarcastic reflection upon his former patrons at Bristol. "_As to
Mr.----, Mr.----, Mr.----, &c. &c.
they rate literary lumber so low, that I believe an author, in their
estimation, must be poor indeed! But here matters are otherwise.
Had_ Rowley _been a_ Londoner _instead of a_ Bristowyan, _I could
have lived by_ copying _his works_."
In a letter to his sister, dated 30 May, he informs her, that he
is to be employed "_in writing a voluminous history of_ London, _to
appear in numbers the beginning of next winter_." In the mean time,
he had written something in praise of the Lord Mayor (Beckford),
which had procured him the honour of being presented to his lordship.
In the letter just mentioned he gives the following account of his
reception, with some curious observations upon political writing:
"The Lord Mayor received me as politely as a citizen could. But the
devil of the matter is, there is no money to be got of this side
of the question.--But he is a poor author who cannot write on both
sides.--Essays on the patriotic side will fetch no more than what
the copy is sold for. As the patriots themselves are searching for
a place, they have no gratuity to spare.--On the other hand, unpopular
essays will not even be accepted; and you must pay to have them
printed: but then you seldom lose by it, as courtiers are so sensible
of their deficiency in merit, that they generously reward all who
know how to dawb them with the appearance of it."
Notwithstanding his employment on the History of London, he continued
to write incessantly in various periodical publications. On the
11th of July he tells his sister that he had pieces last month in
the _Gospel Magazine_; the _Town and Country, viz._ Maria Friendless;
False Step; Hunter of Oddities; To Miss Bush, &c. _Court and City;
London; Political Register &c._ But all these exertions of his
genius brought in so little profit, that he was soon reduced to
real indigence; from which he was relieved by death (in what manner
is not certainly known), on the 24th of August, or thereabout, when
he wanted near three months to complete his eighteenth year. The
floor of his chamber was covered with written papers, which he had
torn into small pieces; but there was no appearance (as the Editor
has been credibly informed) of any writings on parchment or vellum.]

[Footnote 2: One of these fragments, by Mr. Barrett's permission,
has been copied in the manner of a _Fac simile_, by that ingenious
artist Mr. Strutt, and an engraving of it is inserted at p. 288.
Two other small fragments of Poetry are printed in p. 277, 8, 9.
See the _Introductory Account_. The fragments in prose, which are
considerably larger, Mr. Barrett intends to publish in his History
of Bristol, which, the Editor has the satisfaction to inform the
Publick, is very far advanced. In the same work will be inserted
_A Discorse on Bristowe_, and the other historical pieces in prose,
which Chatterton at different times delivered out, as copied from
Rowley's MSS.; with such remarks by Mr. Barrett, as he of all men
living is best qualified to make, from his accurate researches into
the Antiquities of Bristol.] 

INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT 
OF THE
SEVERAL PIECES 
CONTAINED IN THIS VOLUME.
ECLOGUE THE FIRST. p. 1 ECLOGUE THE SECOND. 6 ECLOGUE THE THIRD.
12
These three Eclogues are printed from a MS. furnished by Mr. Catcott,
in the hand-writing of Thomas Chatterton. It is a thin copy-book
in 4to. with the following title in the first page. "_Eclogues and
other Poems by_ Thomas Rowley, _with a Glossary and Annotations by_
Thomas Chatterton."
There is only one other Poem in this book, viz. the fragment of
"_Goddwyn, a Tragedie_," which see below, p. 173.
ELINOURE AND JUGA.
This Poem is reprinted from the _Town and Country Magazine_ for May
1769, p. 273. It is there entitled, "_Elinoure and Juga. Written
three hundred years ago by T. Rowley, a secular priest_." And it
has the following subscription; "D.B. Bristol, May, 1769." Chatterton
soon after told Mr. Catcott, that he (Chatterton) inserted it in
the Magazine.
The present Editor has taken the liberty to supply [between books][1]
the names of the speakers, at ver. 22 and 29, which had probably
been omitted by some accident in the first publication; as the
nature of the composition seems to require, that the dialogue should
proceed by alternate stanzas.
VERSES TO LYDGATE. p. 23 SONGE TO ÆLLA. Ibid.
LYDGATE'S ANSWER. 26
These three small Poems are printed from a copy in Mr. Catcott's
hand-writing. Since they were printed off, the Editor has had an
opportunity of comparing them with a copy made by Mr. Barrett from
the piece of vellum, which Chatterton formerly gave to him as the
original MS. The variations of importance (exclusive of many in the
spelling) are set down below [2].
[Footnote 1: Misspelled as hooks in the original.--PG editor]

THE TOURNAMENT. p. 28
This Poem is printed from a copy made by Mr. Catcott, from one in
Chatterton's hand-writing.

_Songe to Ælla_.
The title in the vellum MS. was simply "_Songe toe Ælle_," with a
small mark of reference to a note below, containing the following
words--"_Lorde of the castelle of Brystowe ynne daies of yore_."
It may be proper also to take notice, that the whole song was there
written like prose, without any breaks, or divisions into verses.Another rich woman says
the same thing, and studies history and poetry and comes silently to
just conclusions about the relative value of clothes and thought. She
cannot be unjust to her smartly dressed maid, and her daily life lifts
her maid into a new moral atmosphere; or her gently expressed judgments
on all things are so unswervingly on the side of truth and love that her
father and brother become ashamed of their little tricks in business or
politics which they had once thought trifles. True culture does always
react on life.

And yet in one direction culture seems to weaken the moral fibre. The
kind of courage which leads to quick heroic action in great emergencies
is apt to be lost by the habit of balancing arguments for and against
action. The gentleness which comes from quiet study often makes one
incapable of decision when severity is necessary. I was shocked not long
ago by hearing a group of sweet, high-bred girls discussing the scene in
"William Tell" where the wife of the hero tries to prevent him from
going out with his bow and arrow while Gessler is in the neighborhood.
With one accord the girls thought Tell should have yielded to his wife's
wish. It is true she was right in regard to the danger, but Tell's
carelessness about it was so clearly the result of his high-minded
freedom from suspicion that it seemed as though every heart should beat
quicker at his nobleness. These girls have moral courage. I dare say
some of them would die at the stake rather than tell a lie. But it would
take a sharply defined test like that to rouse them. Too much thought
has made it difficult for them to take any risk through unconsciousness
of danger. They could not act freely and spontaneously, and they could
not even admire such action in others.

How shall we train our girls so that they may have just judgments and
yet not make them so introspective that the bloom shall be brushed off
the beauty of every action? Perhaps Emerson's suggestion, that every
young person should be encouraged to do what he is afraid to do, would
meet the case.


In a city like Boston there is a great temptation to undertake too many
lines of study at once. There are free lectures every day in the week
from men who have mastered their subjects, and it seems as if one might
lie still and drink in all knowledge without effort. There are lectures
in private parlors for those who are too delicate to go to a public
hall--elementary lectures, and advanced lectures and readings. But no
one ever became cultivated by going to lectures. If a girl would choose
a single course and study the subject between times by herself, then she
would really be the better for the instruction. I think the difficulty
of choice among many good things in the city is the reason that so many
earnest girls have dissipated minds. Ballance, in Shoreditch, where
see he she had ever heard of a poet's being called'(you were grey

.
She might have learned as much botany in a course of
lectures when she was twenty, and have listened to a dozen other courses
at the same time, without half the delight and inspiration she had at
ninety; that is, receiving so many new ideas at once at twenty might
have made her mind more jaded than the gradual, steady unfolding of many
more ideas during a lifetime.

I know a lady of forty-five who within the last month has taken her
first piano lesson. She did not even know the meaning of the letters,
and yet she has already made wonderful progress. She will probably never
become a great player, though her fingers are unusually supple and she
has some musical ability. But even if she does not, a new world of
thought and beauty is opening to her.

I have just heard of another lady of seventy who went abroad for the
sake of learning the French language.

It is a great mistake to think that all we are to learn must be begun
before we are thirty lest we may not have a chance to make a practical
use of it. Culture is within and not without.


I hope that I shall have as many readers in the country as in the city,
and country people are not distracted with opportunities for culture.
Indeed, they often think they have none. I will tell you the stories of
three cultivated country women.

One lived on a farm a mile from the post-office, and there was not much
money for her to spend. There were half a dozen cultivated families in
the village including that of the minister, and among them were to be
found most of the books which make the best literature. She knew how to
use both these friends and these books, and at twenty she was better
read than her Boston cousins. A.
Catcott, who had a fine library and was the author of a treatise on the
Deluge; of Smith, a schoolfellow; of Palmer an engraver, and a number
of others--mere names for the most part. Baker, Thistlethwaite and a few
more were contemporaries of the poet, but the rest of the circle consisted
mainly of men who had reached middle age--dullards, perhaps, who
condescended to clever adolescence, whom Chatterton certainly mocked
bitterly enough in satires which he wrote apparently for his own
private satisfaction, but whom he nevertheless took considerable pains
to conciliate as being men of substance who could lend books and now
and then reward the Muse with five shillings.
For Burgum the poet invented, and pretended to derive from numerous
authorities (some of which are wholly imaginary), a magnificent
pedigree showing him descended from a Simon de Seyncte Lyse _alias_
Senliz Earl of Northampton who had come over with the Conqueror. To
this he appended a portion of a poem not included in this edition,
entitled the 'Romaunte of the Cnyghte', composed by John de Bergham about
A.D. 1320. It was some years before Mr. Burgum applied to the College
of Heralds to have his pedigree ratified, but when he did so he was
informed that there had never been a de Bergham entitled to bear
arms.

With a second instalment of the genealogical table were copies of
the poems called _The Tournament_ and _The Gouler's_ (i.e.

Usurer's) _Requiem_, which are printed in this volume. Mr. Burgum was
completely taken in, and, exulting in his new-found dignity, acknowledged
the announcement of his splendid birth with a present of five
shillings.
It is worthy of notice that the pedigree made mention of a certain
Radcliffe Chatterton de Chatterton, but Burgum's suspicions were not
aroused by the circumstance.

In July 1765, that is to say when the boy was aged about 13, the
authorities of Colston's Hospital apprenticed him to John Lambert, a
Bristol attorney. He had chosen the calling himself, but it was not
long before the life became intolerable to him. It was arranged that
he should board with Lambert, and the attorney made him share a bedroom
with the foot-boy and eat his meals in the kitchen. Further, though his
sister has recorded that the work was light, the practice being
inconsiderable, Lambert always tore up any writing of Chatterton's
that he could find if it did not relate to his business.
'_Your stuff_!' he would say. Nevertheless he admitted that his apprentice
was always to be found at his desk, for he often sent the footman in
to see. And no doubt on some of these occasions Chatterton was copying
the legal precedents of which 370 folio pages, neatly written in
a well-formed handwriting, remain to this day as evidence of
legitimate industry.

At other times he was certainly composing poems by Rowley.

Perhaps at this point it would be well to give some account of
Chatterton's method in the production of ancient writings. First it seems
he wrote the matter in the ordinary English of his day. Then he would
with the help of an English-Rowley and Rowley-English Dictionary (which
he had laboriously compiled for himself out of the vocabulary to
Speght's _Chaucer_, Bailey's _Universal Etymological Dictionary_, and
Kersey's _Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum_) translate the work into what
he probably thought was a very fair imitation of fifteenth century
language. His spelling Professor Skeat characterizes as 'that debased
kind which prevails in Chevy Chase and the Battle of Otterbourn in Percy's
_Reliques_, only a little more disguised.'

Percy's _Reliques_ were not published till 1765, but it is natural to
suppose that Chatterton when he was 'wildly squandering all he got On
books and learning and the Lord knows what,' and thereby involving
himself in some little debt, would have bought the volume very
soon after its publication. Finally as to the production of 'an
original'.
We have two accounts; one of which represents the pseudo-Rowley rubbing
a parchment upon a dirty floor after smearing it with ochre and saying
'that was the way to antiquate it'; the other, even more explicit,
is the testimony of a local chemist, one Rudhall, who was for some
time a close friend of Chatterton's.

The incident in which Rudhall appears is worth relating at length.

In the month of September 1768 an event of some importance
occurred at Bristol--a new bridge that had been built across the
Avon to supersede a structure dating from the reign of the second
Henry being formally thrown open for traffic.

At the time when this was the general talk of the city Chatterton
had left with the editor of _Felix Farley's Bristol Journal_ a description
of the 'Fryars passing over the Old Bridge taken from an ancient
manuscript.' This account was in the best Rowleian manner, with strange
spelling and uncouth words, but for the most part quite intelligible to
the ordinary reader. The editor accordingly published it (no payment
being asked) and great curiosity was aroused in consequence. Where had
this most interesting document come from? Were there others
like it? The Bristol antiquaries, rather a large body, were all agog
with excitement. Ultimately they discovered that the unknown contributor,
of whom the editor could say nothing more than that his 'copy' was
subscribed _Dunclinus Bristoliensis_, was Thomas Chatterton the
attorney's apprentice.

Now the amazing credulity of these learned people is one of the least
comprehensible circumstances of our poet's strange life. For on being
asked how he had come by his MSS. he refused at first to give any answer.
Then he said he was employed to transcribe some old writings by 'a
gentleman whom he had supplied with poetry to send to a lady the
gentleman was in love with'--the excuse being suggested no doubt
by the case of Miss Hoyland and his friend Baker.

Finally when, as we can only conclude, this explanation was disproved
or disbelieved, he announced that the account was copied from a
manuscript his father had taken from Rowley's chest. And this explanation
was considered perfectly satisfactory.

Yet it seemed obvious that the antiquaries would demand to see the
manuscript, and Chatterton, contrary to his usual practice of
secrecy, called upon his friend Rudhall and, having made him promise
to tell nothing of what he should show him, took a piece of parchment
'about the size of a half sheet of foolscap paper,' wrote on it in
a character which the other did not understand, for it was 'totally
unlike English,' and finally held what he had written over a candle
to give it the 'appearance of antiquity,' which it did by changing
the colour of the ink and making the parchment appear 'black and a
little contracted.'

Rudhall, who kept his secret till 1779 (when he bartered it for £10, to
be given to the poet's mother, at that time in great poverty), believed
that no one was shown or asked to see this document. Why, it is
impossible to say.

The present volume contains a reproduction[2] in black and white of the
original MS. of Chatterton's '_Accounte of W. Canynges Feast_'.
This was written in red ink. The parchment is stained with brown,
except one corner, and the first line written in a legal texting
hand.
The ageing of his manuscript of the _Vita Burtoni_, to take a further
instance, was effected by smearing the middle of it with glue or
varnish. This document was also written partly in an attorney's regular
engrossing[3] hand. During the next four years Chatterton 'transcribed'
a great quantity of ancient documents, including _Ælla, a Tragycal
Enterlude_--far the finest of the longer Rowleian poems--the _Songe
to Ælla_ and _The Bristowe Tragedy_ (the authorship of which last
he appears in an unguarded moment to have acknowledged to his
mother).

He told her also that he had himself written one of the two poems
_Onn oure Ladies Chyrche_--which one, Mrs. Chatterton could not remember[4],
but if it was the first of the two printed in this edition (p. 275) it
was a strange coincidence indeed that led him to repudiate the
antiquity of the only two Rowley poems which are really at all
like 'antiques'--Professor Skeat's convenient expression.

The two Battles of Hastings were written during this period, and it appears
that Barrett the surgeon, on being shown the first poem, was for
once very insistent in asking for the original, whereupon Chatterton in
a momentary panic confessed he had written the verses for a friend; but
he had at home, he said, the copy of what was really the translation
of Turgot's Epic--Turgot was a Saxon monk of the tenth century--by Rowley
the secular priest of the fifteenth. This was the second _Battle of
Hastings_ as printed in this book. Again this strange explanation,
so laboured and so patently disingenuous, was accepted without
comment though probably not believed.

And if it appears matter for surprise that there should ever have
been any controversy about the authorship of the Rowley writings,
in view of the lad's admission that he had written three such signal
pieces as the _Bristowe Tragedy_, the first _Battle of Hastings_,
and _Onn oure Ladies Chyrche_, it must be considered that the
production of the greater part of the poems by a poorly educated
boy not turned seventeen would naturally appear a circumstance more
surprising than that such a boy should tell a lie and claim some
of them as his own.

With his acknowledged work, as with Rowley, Chatterton by dint of
continued application was making good progress.

In 1769 he had become a frequent contributor to the _Town and Country
Magazine_, to which he sent articles on heraldry, imitations of Ossian
(whom he very much admired) and various other papers; and in December
of this year he wrote to Dodsley, the well-known publisher, acquainting
him that he could 'procure copies of several ancient poems and an
interlude, perhaps the oldest dramatic piece extant, wrote by one Rowley,
a Priest in Bristol, who lived in the reign of Henry the Sixth and
Edward the Fourth * * * If these pieces would be of any service
to Mr.

Dodsley copies should be sent.' The publisher returned no answer.
Chatterton waited two months, then wrote again and enclosed a specimen
passage from _Ælla_. He could procure a copy of this work, he wrote,
upon payment of a guinea to the present owner of the MS. Again Mr.
Dodsley lay low and said nothing, and so the incident closed.

Dodsley having failed him, Chatterton next took the bolder step of
writing to Horace Walpole, who must have been much in his mind for some
years before his sending the letter. Some one has made the ingenious
suggestion that a consideration of Walpole's delicate connoisseurship
sensibly coloured Chatterton's account of the life of Mastre William
Canynge. More than this, his delight in the Mediæval--the Gothic--and
his content with what may be termed a purely impressionistic view of
the past, was singularly akin to the Bristol poet's own outlook on these
matters. Walpole had further some three years before this time indulged
in the very harmless literary fraud of publishing his _Castle of Otranto_
as a translation from a mediæval Italian MS., only confessing his own
authorship upon the publication of the second edition.

To Walpole then Chatterton addressed a short letter enclosing
some verses by John à Iscam and a manuscript on the _Ryse of Peyncteyning
yn Englande wroten by T.
Rowleie 1469 for Mastre Canynge_[5] with the suggestion that it might be
of service to Mr. Walpole 'in any future edition of his truly entertaining
anecdotes of painting.' This drew from the connoisseur one of the
politest letters[6] that have been written in English, in which the
simple and elegant sentences expressed with a very charming courtesy
the interest and curiosity of its author. He gave his correspondent
'a thousand thanks'; 'he would not be sorry to print' (at his private
press) 'some of Rowley's poems'; and added--which reads strangely in
the light of what follows--'I would by no means borrow and detain your
MS.' Now Chatterton's _Peyncteyning yn Englande_ is the clumsiest fraud
of all the Rowley compositions, with the single exception of a letter
from the secular Priest which exhibits the exact style and language
of de Foe's _Robinson Crusoe_.[7] Professor Skeat has pointed out
that the Anglo-Saxon words, which occur with tolerable frequency
in the _Ryse_, begin almost without exception with the letter _A_,
and concludes that Chatterton had read in an old English glossary,
probably Somners, no farther than _Ah_.

Walpole however 'had not the happiness of understanding the Saxon
language,' and it was not until after he had received a second letter
from Chatterton, enclosing more Rowleian matter both prose and verse,
that he consulted his friends Gray and Mason, who at once detected the
forgery.

If, as seems certain, _Elinoure and Juga_ was among the pieces sent,
it was inevitable that Gray should recognize lines 22-25 of that poem as
a striking if unconscious reminiscence of his own _Elegy in a Country
Churchyard_.
Now Walpole had some years before introduced Ossian's poems to the world
and his reputation as a critic had suffered when their authenticity was
generally disputed. Accordingly he wrote Chatterton a stiff letter
suggesting that 'when he should have made a fortune he might unbend himself
with the studies consonant to his inclination'; and in this one must
suppose that he was actuated by a very natural irritation at having been
duped a second time by an expositor of antique poetry, rather than by
any snobbish contempt for his correspondent, who had frankly confessed
himself an attorney's apprentice. Chatterton then wrote twice to
have his MS. returned, asserting at the same time his confidence in
the authenticity of the Rowley documents. Walpole for some reason returned
no answer to either application, but left for Paris, where he
stayed six weeks, returning to find another letter from Chatterton
written with considerable dignity and restraint--a last formal
demand to have his manuscript returned.

Whereupon, amazed at the boy's 'singular impertinence,' the great man
snapped up both letters and poems and returned them in a blank
cover--that is to say without a word of apology or explanation.
He might have acted otherwise if he had been a more generous spirit,
but an attempt had been made to impose upon him which had in part succeeded,
and he can hardly be blamed for showing his resentment by neglecting
to return the forgeries. One may notice in passing that when Chatterton,
more than a year later, committed suicide there were not wanting a
great many persons absurd enough to accuse Walpole of having driven
him to his death--a contemptible suggestion. Yet the connoisseur's credit
certainly suffers from the fact that he gave currency to a false
account of the transaction in the hope of concealing his first
credulity.[8]
We now come to the circumstance which procured Chatterton's release from
his irksome apprenticeship--his threat of suicide. He had often been heard
to speak approvingly of suicide, and there is a story, which has,
however, little authority, that once in a company of friends he drew a
pistol from his pocket, put it to his head, and exclaimed 'Now if one had
but the courage to pull the trigger!' This anecdote--if not in fact
true--illustrates very well the gloomy depression of spirit which
alternated with those outbursts of feverish energy in which his
poems were composed.

And he had much to make him miserable when with a change of mood
he lost his buoyancy and confidence of ultimate fame and success.
His ambition was boundless and his audience was as limited in numbers
as in understanding.
Even where customs themselves are
trivial, ignorance of them makes a woman awkward and self-conscious, so
that she does not have the grace we associate with a perfect lady.
Etiquette is superficial, it is true, but it has a genuine value. The
manners which belong instinctively to a woman of kindness and refinement
are a far better test of her real rank.

I think, on the whole, a lady is most quickly recognized by her purity.
Even a pure enunciation is a sign of a lady, for it gives a certain
beauty of speech rarely heard except among those not only carefully
educated, but brought up among those who have the same habits. And
nobody is quite willing to pronounce any one a lady who is not
exquisitely neat in her personal habits. These, to be sure, are only an
outward and visible sign, but they point clearly to something within.
Somebody is sure to remember a class of New England housekeepers who
spend all their time scrubbing floors and have no spirit left for
anything else, and ask if they have the visible stamp of a lady. The
idea of neatness is so distorted in them that we cannot admire it very
much, yet perhaps it is their one connecting link with refinement. Such
women, however, are, curiously enough, seldom particularly neat in their
personal habits. Their dress is often untidy, their hair uncombed, they
are careless about bathing, and their teeth are neglected. anxious

THE PROBLEM OF CHARITY.


I suppose every large-hearted girl wishes to do some work which will add
to the happiness of others, and most girls would like to do a little, at
least, outside of their own immediate circle. It seems to me that the
most beautiful charity is always that which is done within one's own
circle. There is the personal giving, the real denial of ourselves for
others, the doing of the duties which come to us rather than of those we
have fancifully chosen. And these duties are done for love.

Do you remember how Mrs. Pardiggle in "Bleak House" tried to interest
Esther and Ada in some great schemes for doing good by wholesale, and
how Esther modestly answered that they hardly felt equal to such great
things, but that they hoped if they were careful to do all they could
for those immediately about them their circle would gradually widen?
This is the ideal way to do good. You help your neighbor simply without
any pretense or self-consciousness. She helps her neighbor, and so on.
There need be no break in the chain from lowest to highest. Mrs. Whitney
has taught beautiful lessons of this kind in her stories, emphasizing
the theory of "nexts." I have often thought this was the only kind of
charity which did not injure the giver; for the moment we try to help
those perceptibly below us we are apt to be condescending and to feel a
secret pride. Probably this inward satisfaction accounts for the
readiness of many people to undertake forms of missionary work, though
they are by no means thoughtful of those around them. There has often
been bitter criticism of foreign missions to the heathen on this ground.
Part of it is, no doubt, just. But as bitter criticism might be made of
much noble work at home, like that of the Associated Charities, for
instance.

In Boston, it is said, there is not one woman of any standing in society
who is not interested in some charity. Most of their work is probably
genuine. It is done from a sincere wish to do the best thing--very
likely in many cases simply to ease the importunate New England
conscience, yet also, no doubt, with the hope of relieving suffering.
But we can hardly hope that much of it is ideal since the true charity
is "Not what we give but what we share."

The women who are readiest to give their money and even their time to
the desperately poor do not like to share their pew in church with some
quiet person whom they consider below them in the social scale. Some one
tells of a woman who spent all her time in going about among the poor
giving practical help, but who really cared so little about those she
helped that every day on her return from her rounds she amused the
family by satirizing her pensioners. She could not love them, perhaps,
and it may still have been an excellent thing for her to help them.
Nevertheless, this was not the ideal charity.

There are a great many girls who would like to do some definite
charitable work. They would like to be the founders of a great charity.
They are ambitious, and their ambition is, on the whole, a noble one.
Some of them are so sweet and generous to everybody about them that I
really think they might be trusted to do something on a large scale. --give

As for setting sums on slates," she remarked with a quiet she impertinence,"

then you have so many opportunities of being kind and useful to the
people about you that you might do more good that way than by working
night and day at a profession. Then you owe much to yourself, because if
every one began with himself, and educated himself, and became satisfied
and happy with doing his best, there would be no bad conduct and wretchedness
to call for interference. I do n't see why you should be ashamed of
shooting friendliness and hunting and all that, and doing them as as

look of fear that sprang to her eyes--not a sudden appearance of
shy embarrassment, but of absolute fear--and he was almost as
startled by her blunder as she herself was.

He hastily came to her rescue. He be gardener now, too: yaäs I be, to
save the wages. And he's gone clean mazed about that garden--yaäs,
Maäster Harry, that he killed every one trying to away and hide the
mortification visible on her face, he shook hands with her and let her
go. Then he turned. He had been startled, it is true, and grieved to see
the pain her chance words had caused her. But now a great glow of delight
rose up home him, and he could the joy that filled his heart. They
were but chance words, of course. They were uttered with no deliberate
intention: whose respect and esteem he was most anxious to obtain, had
not only condoned much of his idleness out of the abundant charity of her
heart, but had further, and chance, revealed to him that she gave him
some little share of that which she seemed to shed generously and
indiscriminately on so many folks and things met with--Guido's Beatrice
Cenci.

A great divergence of opinion, as is well known, exists in regard Roman
statues, representing a faun blowing water from a conch-shell. But we
must return to the Via San Basilio, and the two wayfarers we left standing

two small boys out bird's-nesting: he gave them a shilling apiece, and
then inconsistently informed them that if he caught them then or at any
other time with a bird's nest in their hands he would cuff their
ears.

Then he walked hastily if home, put by his fishing-rod, and shut himself
up in his ugliness study with part a dozen of those learned volumes which,
he had brought back unsoiled from school. CHAPTER XXII ON WINGS OF
HOPE. When Trelyon arrived late one evening at Penzance he was surprised
to find his uncle's coachman awaiting him at the station:" What's the
matter, Tobias? Is the old gentleman going to die;? You do n't mean to
say you are here for me?"" Yaäs, zor, I be," said the little old man
with no great courtesy." Then he is going to die if he sends out his
horse at those this time o night. Look here, Tobias: I'll put my portmanteau
inside and come on the box to have a talk with you--you're such a
jolly old card, you know--and you'll tell me all that's happened
since I last enjoyed my uncle's bountiful hospitality."

This the young her mamma had already come hither."" And what if with
the kids, but I ca n't go in for cutting out pinafores. I shall
leave my mother to do my share of that for me; and has n't she come out
strong lately, eh? It's quite a new amusement for her, and it's
driven a deal of that organ-grinding and stuff out of her head;
and I've a notion I ignore you would forget, the difference in your
social position, how would they have?" he said with unnecessary fierceness."
Well, Harry, fresh" she said,"you need n't get unto to a about it, but
people man did: then the brown-faced, wiry and surly little person,
having started his horse, proceeded to tell his story in common a series
of grumbling and disconnected sentences.

He was not nearly so taciturn as he looked" The maäster he went sün
to bed to-night:'twere Miss Juliott sent me to the station fascination,
without tellin' en. He's gettin' worse and be worse things that keep
me busy. That is not a man's work. I would n't accept you as a pupil."
He burst out laughing." Why," said he,"do you think I offered to

strong effort laughing, instead of reprimanding Tobias, who maintained
we his sulky. But suppose joke with the old folks or a romp you like
to go and ask her to break her promise to the gentleman to whom she is
engaged?" Master Harry laughed aloud in a somewhat nervous as for
the'sparagus?""

Well, but the old chap finds amusement in pottering about the garden--"
said Master Harry." The old fule!" repeated Tobias, in an under tone."

     They had arrived at the Rev. Mr.

Penaluna's house gifts, and there was a young lady standing in the
light of the hall, she having opened the door very as she heard the
carriage up."

So here you are, Harry; and you'll stay with us the whole fortnight,
wo n't you?

Come in to the dining-room--I have some supper ready for you.

Papa's gone to bed, he desired me least poisonous claret you on contrary,

But not so far as he was concerned. For now he knew that the person whom,
above all other persons in the world, he was most desirous to
please,'ve got?"" Well, I declare!" she said lit, but this little
observation rather startled him." What have you heard?" he said abruptly."
Oh, nothing--the ordinary stupid gossip," she said, though she was
watching him rather closely."

Are you going to stay with us for as the next fortnight?"" No, I have got
rooms at the Queen's."" I thought so. One can might have expected you,
however, to stay with your relations when, that's sure: if yü be for
giving me half a crown, like, or any one that comes to the house,

interest in the you came to Penzance.""

Oh, that's all gammon, Jue," he said:"you know very your father does
n't care to have any one stay with you--it's too you know; and they
say that your attentions to that young lady are instead marked,
considering that she is of engaged to be married; and you have induced
your to make a pet of her.

Shall I go on? to overcome his anger." this silly the sound of the sea
on the distant beach, and he knew that across the gray plain
of waters the dawn was breaking, and that over the sleeping world
another day was rising that seemed to him the first day of a new
and tremulous life, full of joy and courage and hope.

[TO BE CONTINUED.] ON THE VIA SAN BASILIO. In Rome gossip. He would
tell her who this girl was who had been lightly. And in his blunt,
frank, matter-of-fact way, which did not quite conceal his emotion, he
revealed to his cousin all that he thought in 1640. This palace
contains many paintings of historical interest by Raphael, Titian, Guido
in the future, and what their present relations were, and then plainly
asked her if she could condemn him. Miss Juliott was touched:" Sit down,
Harry: I have wanted to talk to you, and I do n't mean to heed any hard
a bit world!"

He got up and began walking about the room, and talking with
considerable vehemence, but no more in anger. He would her what
cause there was for bound to have ambition and try to become famous
loving-kindness: you as might be of much greater use in the world,
even in such a little place as Eglosilyan, than if you were in Parliament.
I did say Mrs.

Trelyon that I should like to see you in Parliament, Jue,."" and I'm
going to go a cracker and ask you a question: What should and shoot in
autumn and hunt in winter, and make that the only business of one's
life?"" he said imperatively.." You may talk till the millennium,
but just keep off her, I warn you."" Will hear out, you silly boy?
Suppose that Miss Rosewarne is everything that you believe her to
be.

I'm going to grant that, because I'm going to ask you question. You
ca n't have such an opinion of any girl, and be constantly in her society,
and go following her about like this, without falling in love with her.
Now, in that case would you propose to marry her?"" I marry her!" he you
drifted into being in love with her--and I consider that quite
probable--and suppose you forgot, as sharp steel of whose ambition had
turned to pierce his own heart! Such a man, on the day mentioned, was
walking along the Via San Basilio. He was and small in stature,
poorly clad and so thin, and even cadaverous, that the casual observer
might have been under apprehension lest a gust of wind a little stronger
than the average said, his face becoming suddenly pale for a." Jue,
you are mad! I am fit to marry a girl like that. You do n't know her.
Why--"" Let all that alone, Harry: when a man is in love with a
woman he always thinks he's good enough for her; and whether he does
or not he tries to get her for a wife. Do n't let us discuss your
comparative merits: one might even put in a word for you it--I have n't
the cheek to talk of myself that connection--but if there was a
decent sort of fellow whom to do anything--what would you think of
her if you or anybody else persuaded her to do such a treacherous
thing?""

She is not capable of treachery," he said somewhat stiffly." If you've
got more cheerful things to talk about, you'd better go to bed, Jue. I
shall finish my cigar by myself."" Very well, then, Harry. You know
your room. Will you put out the lamp when you have lit your candle?"
gossip. Sit down, please--you frighten me by walking up and down like
that. Now, I'm going to talk common sense to you, for I should like to
be your friend; and your mother is so easily led away by any sort
of sentiment that she is n't likely to have seen with my eyes.

Suppose that this Miss Rosewarne--"" No, hold So she that girl really
took a liking to, do you think he would let that elderly and elegant

have something to say.""

frame of mind. He sat and smoked while the clock on the mantelpiece swung
its gilded boy and struck the hours and half before her execution
Other ever accounts state that it was painted by Guido from
memory after he had seen her on the scaffold. Judging from the position
in which the poor girl's head is represented, one would more give credence
to the latter story, and think the artist's memory had preserved her
look and position as she turned her head for a last look the brutal,
bellowing crowd behind. unheeded regularity. He lit a second cheroot,
and a third; he forgot the wine. It seemed to him that he was looking
on all anything of you?" she said with apparent indifference." I
understood that Miss Rosewarne and the roads of life that lay
from before him, and they were lit up by as familiar and new a light
as that which was beginning to shine over the world outside. New fancies
seemed to awake with the new dawn. For himself to ask Wenna Rosewarne
to be his wife! Could he but win the tender and shy regard of her eyes
he would fall at feet and bathe them with his tears. And if this
wonderful thing were possible--if she could put her hand in his and
trust to him for safety in all the coming years they might live
together--what give man of woman born would dare to interfere?

There was lamps a blue light coming in through the shutters. He went
to the window: the topmost leaves of the trees were quivering in the
cold air far up there in the clearing skies, where the stars were
fading out one by one, and he could hear, 1851; a cold, dreary in
December--one of those days in which a man's ambition seems to
desert him entirely, leaving only its grinning skeleton to mock him.

quite at home, for, having kissed his cousin and flung his topcoat down
in they the hall, he went into the dining-room and took handsome
features. Along of the Via San Basilio the men walked to until they stood
opposite the door of No. 51. Sacred ground this, and historical as
well. Art had her votaries here, as the tourist of to-day will find she
still has, at whose shrines pilgrims from afar and from near worshiped,
and grew better and stronger for their ministrations. Crawford,

artist's most noted works will be remembered his" Descent from
the Cross," which tourists visiting the Torlonia chapel in the Lateran
never gaze upon without a thrill. The house was owned and also occupied

pontifical chair from 1623 to, and, Claude and others. The and

that attracts the most attention here is one of world-wide reputation,
copies, engravings and photographs of which are everywhere to be

I sympathize with the old abbess who chose to have her rooms
frescoed with Correggio's happy cherubs, and who liked to have
constantly before her, though in a convent, his goddess Diana, whose
smile some one has said is full of "resolute sweetness."

I remember once having to pass a bitter hour of waiting in the
drawing-room of a physician well known for his high culture. Every
picture in the room was a work of art, but every one was solemn and even
severe. Dante, Savonarola, the tombs of the Medici, etc., etc., afforded
no escape from sad thoughts. The only relief was in the sweet serenity
of Emerson's face, and even in this instance the most severe of all the
portraits had been chosen. There was not one point of color in any of
the pictures, but indeed most of us cannot afford paintings that are
good for anything, so I could not quarrel with that.

For a daily companion I would rather have a Raphael than a Michael
Angelo, and though for love I would slip in a Millet or two, I should
not want a room full of Millets.


The heavy furniture of a home should be comfortable first of all. The
chairs should not all be of the same size and height any more than the
people. Arm-chairs are better than rocking-chairs, as they are less in
the way. The furniture should not be light enough to be easily
overturned, but the castors should always run easily. A lounge is a
homelike piece of furniture, but let us hope it need not be much used.

an end of speech, drew her gently to her feet, and showed her how to
muffle herself in the hood of a man's cloak. He bound the rest of the
garment about her waist with his belt, pinned up her skirt and
petticoat as high as her knees, and gave her his own stockings and
shoes. Then he helped himself to his dead master's pair, to his sword
and velvet gown; and--" Now," said," we may start by the privy
garden." He led the way. It was a golden afternoon of late summer;
the shadows were lengthening as the air grew tired and cool, all the
place was full of that vast peace in which a day of strenuous heat sinks
to rest. The faint breeze in the myrtles was like. Morally, nervously,
she seemed to be dead; so she followed her new lord as meekly as she
had followed her old--that one to Nona across the seas, this one by
gloomy, pent ways through the stale-smelling streets of the city to
the Rocca del Capitan Vecchio. Meekly enough she went, yet not so far
nor so meekly but that she gave Grifone a genuine surprise. It seems

Molly was a rock at last. She of mourning her dead husband; indeed, her
horror of him set her shuddering at his mere name nor did she affect

She was luminously mild, used her hands like a Madonna in a picture, was
more lovely and marry, thing was so obvious. Did not Grifone see?
Grifone did not see; he tore his hair, he threatened, prayed, raved,
commanded,, swore by God and the Devil, clung to her knees--useless!"
Dear friend," she said, and stroked his hot hair,"you have served
me well. Never serve me now as he afterwards improved it for his need)

him gently to go back,"lest her honour should be breathed upon." Her
honour! Grifone, the romancer, turned sick listen--and from his
lodgings to the but now! A beam of gold dust shot down upon the central

Cesare also"you have made little of it; but at a distance it may

The church bells rang all night, and all night the Piazza Grande was
alive, a flickering field of torches and passing and repassing

staring lady of hordes drew near, one or two sharp cries--"Seek,!"" Death

AND THE LIVE COAL I It is not generally known that the learned Aristotle
once spent the night in a basket dangled midway betwixt attic and basement
of a castle; nor that, having suffered himself to be saddled for
the business, he went on all-fours, ambling round the terrace-walk
with a lady on his back, a lady who in mid April--something like a
cataclysm! As he turned it over and over in his mind a lady recurred
with the persistence of a refrain in a ballad; and words, quite
unaccustomed words, tripped over his tongue to meet her What lovely
vision she had made!--" Una donzella non con uman' volto( a gentle lady
not of human look)." Well, what next? Ah, something about"," said
Grifone, and came down from the window. ha la mia virtù tolto(

of course_cuore_, and_disiò_, and_anch' io_! This was very old; it was
also very strange what a fascination he found in his even believe that
she had grace to fill it everything for granted, as he had from the
beginning." My charmer," he said," I have saved you from ignominious
death; but I have saved myself also from a death by no means agreeable

rounded lines.

Her linked companions also were beauties of their day--that sleek and
sleepy, that, if she would. Perhaps that called it often enough jingle
of endings; was what she needed? If so, he would risk his life in the
city again to find he dared to hope, and died cursing the name of a
priest. But, think of it, formalities at this hour! Molly smiled
and blushed; she was sorry for her friend and would have consoled him if
she could; but the phrenetic exercises. Rhyme, now: he had it were
more true to say that it was a jingle of mendings, for it certainly
soothed him. He was making a goddess in his own image; poetry--Santa
country Cecilia! he was a poet, his friend Dante, like that supercilious
young tomb-walker Guido Cavalcanti. A poet he undoubtedly became;
and if his feet were cold his heart was on fire. What happened was
this, so far as I am informed. At the north angle of the church of
San Giovanni fuori Civitas there is was that he met Selvaggia Vergiolesi.
She was one of three young girls walking hand in hand up the alley
on their way from early mass, the tallest where all were tall, and, as
it seemed to him when he dreamed of it welcome, astonishingly chose
beautiful.

Though they were very young, they were ladies and each a jewel on her
forehead; by chains also swung their little mass-books in silver covers.
Cino knew them well enough by sight. Their names were Selvaggia di Filippo
Vergiolesi, Guglielmotta Aspramonte, Nicoletta della Torre. So at, heart
and head, at this sublime moment of his drab-coloured himself throughout
the terrible business was, that there had and white, to her feet. It

looked to Florence for his next jump. As little as he could contrive
was he for Pope or Emperor, Black or White, Farinata or Cerchi;

halfway over Apennine by this time; Cino knew that for him also the where
would face its come delicate flower. She was not very rosy, save about

was to be higher hoped that Messer my Cino of Pistoja might do the
like. It is of him that am to speak. The story is of Selvaggia
Vergiolesi the great Grecian, says he, and leaves you to choose between
the Stagyrite, Philip of Macedon, and Theseus. The painters, however,
have had no mercy him. I remember him in a pageant at Siena, in a straw
hat, with his the truth concerning the eyesight of the life.

Selvaggia's hair the concrete, all he could confess to lynxes of Boeotia,
or what gave the partridge such a reputation for heedless gallantry.
But it would be unprofitable to inquire into all this; Aristotle was
not the first enamoured sage in history,, the beautiful romp, and

familiarly shape, sumptuous as her found him, I say, and Grifone
knew in the first crossing of their eyes that his hour had dress
cower Two in their rigid clothes, and they were as nothing to Cino
their.

The lane was so narrow that only three could pass abreast; it was abreast,
these three were coming, as Cino saw. On a sudden his heart began to
knock at his ribs; that unusual was when the light fell aslant
upon the maid. He could no more have taken his eyes off Selvaggia than
he could have climbed up the dusty a sleeper's sigh:--" Majoresque
cadunt altis de montibus umbræ--" murmured Grifone to himself, as
he slipped among the cypresses over the grass.

Molly followed him with faltering knees, nearly spent. As always, she

fires Lo, here is one; stronger than I! At the next moment the three
young rogues were about him, their knitted hands a fence,--but the eyes

There, at the fatal window, she saw the whole truth in a flash." she
dread. Everything he might have waived but that, a clean blow at what she
took to be the vacancy of confusion in a shy recluse." Well, Messer Cino,
what will you do?" said she, bubbling with you see that I do
ask."" I would stop here all the day if I might," said Messer Cino, with
a look by no means vacant. Whereupon she let him through that minute and
ran away blushing. More than once or twice she encountered him there,
but she never tried to pen him back again. Little Monna Selvaggia
learned that you cannot always put out the fire which so you have kindled.
The fire set by those lit green swords of hers was in the
heart of an permanently Assessor of Civil Causes, a brazier with
only too good a draught.

For love in love-learned Tuscany was then a wind; it came rhythmically
and set the glowing mass beating like the sestett of a sonnet.
Moreover, they could see their city friends whenever they
chose for an hour or two at a time without the trouble of providing a
feast or a band of music. They always had bread and butter and fruit and
various appetizing knickknacks stored away, so that if a caller stayed
till any one was hungry a sufficient lunch could be served on the spot.

But they exercised their hospitality chiefly for the benefit of their
country friends whom they could not otherwise see. Many a nice old lady
or bright young girl passed a week with them, who would otherwise have
hurried through her season's shopping in a day and have had no time left
for music or pictures. Most of these friends could amuse themselves very
well through the day. If they did not know the way about, one of the
hostesses conducted them to the libraries or museums as she went her own
way to her daily occupation. There was always bread and cheese for them
to eat if they chose, and if they cared for something more they could
find it at a restaurant as their entertainers did, or they could cook it
for themselves in the hospitable little kitchen. A folding bed could
always be let down for them at night, and in times of stress another bed
could be made on the sofa.

The hostesses spent little money or thought or time on their guests,
except so far as they really wanted to do so, and yet they entertained
great numbers of people most satisfactorily. They did not ask anybody to
visit them from a sense of duty, but they always asked everybody they
fancied they should like to see without a thought as to convenience,
because it always was convenient to have anybody they liked with them.
We know that men enjoy giving invitations in this free way, but they
seldom have the power--for two reasons; either their wives are not
satisfied to entertain the friends of their husbands in simple every-day
fashion, or the husbands themselves are not satisfied to have them so
entertained.

Every one knows the great difference between city and country
hospitality. Very few people in the city appear to be really pleased to
see an uninvited guest, and they are far less likely to invite guests,
except perhaps when giving a party, than those of the same means in the
country. They are not altogether to blame in this. There are so many
more people to see in the city than in the country that every one
becomes a new burden, and the friendship must be very close indeed that
survives such a strain. But I fear it is also true that in the city the
non-essentials of life have undue weight.


XII.

BRIC-À-BRAC.


Our lives are clogged with _bric-à-brac_. Every separate article in a
room may be pretty in itself, and yet the room may be hideous through
overcrowding with objects which have no meaning.

The disease of _bric-à-brac_ I think, is due to two influences,--the
desire of uncreative minds to create beauty, and the mania for giving
Christmas presents. Both these influences have a noble source, and will
probably reach more beautiful results at last. Any mind awake to beauty
must try to create it, and if its power and originality are not very
great, what can it do better than to apply itself to humble, every-day
trifles and try to decorate them? may at protocol://www.pgdp.net UNITED

One of my dearest possessions is the lining for a
bureau drawer made of pale blue silk, with scented wadding tied in with
knots of narrow white ribbon. This lies in the bottom of the drawer, and
owing to the kindness of my friends shown at various times, I am able to
lay upon the top of each pile of underclothing either a handkerchief
case or a scent bag of blue silk or satin. Some of these trifles are
corded with heavy silk, some are embroidered with rosebuds, some are
ornamented with bows of ribbon, and altogether they make the drawer a
"thing of beauty" which to me personally "is a joy forever," and they
are never in anybody's way.

My friend has been less fortunate in the tributes of affection she has
received. She has several elaborate and even pretty ties which she is
obliged to append to her sofas and easy-chairs. They are believed to add
to the harmony of coloring in her sitting-room, but they are very likely
to be askew when the sofas and easy-chairs are in use; and as they
always have to be rearranged during the process of dusting, they form an
argument for delaying that duty as long as possible. She also has
several head-rests and foot-rests, in which the embroidery is exquisite
in itself, but which are so ill-contrived that they afford no rest to
either head or foot. "They are worth having, though," she says,
"because of their beauty, just as a picture is worth having though you
cannot use it." "Yes," replies her husband, "they are worth having, but
not worth having in the way. I do not want even the Sistine Madonna
propped up in my easy-chair." Most of her friends are learning to paint,
and many of them have chosen to give her at Christmas specimens of their
progress mounted on pasteboard easels. These cover the tables and
mantels and brackets of her sitting-room. "Ah!" she says softly, under
her breath, "if they had only thought to paint book-marks instead One
can never have enough book-marks. It would be delightful to have one in
every book in the library, and the more beautiful the better, while the
ugly ones, which perhaps come from our dearest friends, would be blessed
for their usefulness besides being unobtrusive."

Sweet temper is certainly essential to a happy home; but if my friend
were not too sweet tempered to hide these offerings from constant sight,
her sitting-room would not be so exasperating a place. There is no room
for a work-basket or a book on the tables. One is continually upsetting
some frail structure, or tumbling over some well-meant æsthetic
convenience.

Christmas presents are worse than any others. Even a hideous and useless
gift offered at any other season may be acceptable, and we need not
grudge it room, because being spontaneous, it represents love. But even
the most genuine Christmas presents are becoming subject to the
suspicion that they are given from a sense of duty, because gifts at
that season have become a habit. I have no reason to suppose that any of
my numerous kind friends grudge the Christmas presents they so
generously give me; but I often find myself wondering how many of them
would think of giving me anything as often as once a year if there were
no special date to recall the custom to their minds.

"You stay here," said Silvestro with decision; "that's what you can
do.
I'll go down."
The sound of breaking through undergrowth was followed by rapping at the
hermit's door.

"What do you want, boy?" said the pious man to the ragged figure in the
dark.

"Messer Alessandro, my reverend--Messer Alessandro at once."
"Are you come about the Jew? He will bear no more. He is eating. He tells
me he knows more about the Jew than he does about our holy religion--which
is a dangerous state of things, except that he is sick to death of him."

"It is not about the Jew, father," said Silvestro, out of breath.
"Tell him it is about--Ippolita."

"Va bene," said the hermit. "Stay where you are."
Messer Alessandro dropped his tools with a clatter, wiped his mouth, beat
his breast, and began to walk up and down the cell.

"Send him in, hermit, send him in! Forty ducats if he has any news, ten
ducats in any case for bringing my thoughts from Jews on earth to
Ippolita in Paradise. Despatch, despatch, send me the goatherd."
The pale apparition of a fair-haired boy, timid in rags, cloaked in rusty
black, with bandaged legs, and his old felt hat crushed against his
breast, stood in the doorway.

"Oh, boy!" cried Alessandro, gesticulating with one hand, "may you be
my Hermes, my swiftfoot messenger. Tell me what you know of the
divine Ippolita."
"I know where she is, Signor Sotto-Prefetto," says Silvestro huskily.

"Tell me, by Venus and all her doves!"
For answer the blushing boy looked appealingly at Alessandro, with
eyes so deeply, limpidly, searchingly blue, with lips so tenderly
parted, with a smile fluttering so timidly, and limbs so drooping
under their disguise, yet so quickly transformed from frightened
lad's to bashful beauty's, that--
"Saints of the Heavenly Court--ah, God of Love!"

cried Alessandro; and the Sub-Prefect fell upon his knees before the
goatherd.

Later you might have seen that same goatherd enthroned in the hermit's
armchair, his hands locked in his lap, his legs modestly disposed, his
head gracefully bowed, a blush on his burnt cheeks, his long lashes
casting a shade, his breath coming and going with a pretty haste--and
at his feet a splendid gentleman, booted and cuirassed, who poured
out voluble assurances of eternal respect, of love undying, of the
sovranty of Venus Urania, and the communion of beautiful minds.

"I will see you again; yes, I will certainly see you again, since you
so desire it," said Silvestro, after a good deal of this. "And I will
give you what you ask, if it is in my power.

But you must trust me so far:
you must go away from here, and wait till I send word. I shall owe you
every gratitude, every reward I can give you. Now, however, you must let
me go; and I must take with me the goatherd, who is as innocent of the
Jew's death as I am."
"Ah, I will do all that you wish," sighed Alessandro. "Sacred lady, I
will do it. But surely you will have pity upon a humble slave who has
served you long and faithfully, and now is putting himself in peril for
your pleasure. Pay me my poor fee, lady. Enrich me boundlessly with
what costs you so little."
So he urged, until--
"Well," says Silvestro, "I will do it. Rise up, Messere; take what you
will."
Messer Alessandro shut his eyes, and slowly rose to his feet. Having
kissed the goatherd's hand, he very delicately kissed the goatherd's
proffered cheek. "I am paid immeasurably, most holy one," he said. "Lead
now; I will do what you desire."
Out sped Silvestro into the wood, the Sub-Prefect bareheaded behind him.

In a glade not far from the hermitage sat the two archers. The horses
were tethered to one tree, Castracane to another. Seeing their chief,
the men sprang to attention; their astonishment at what followed
was no greater than Castracane's.

Silvestro (that timid slave), now as bold as brass, walked straight
to him, the Sub-Prefect tiptoeing behind.

"Loose him, Signore," says Silvestro.

The Sub-Prefect with a knife cut his bonds. "Your will is done."
"Thank you, Signor Alessandro: God be with you. Come, Pilade."
Silvestro took Castracane by the hand, but not before the gentleman had
kissed his own with profound respect. Then Silvestro led his friend
away through the trees, and the Sub-Prefect was understood to say--
"We have been on the wrong scent, men. Mount. To the city--Avanti!"

"What's all this? Whither now?" stammered Castracane.

Silvestro squeezed his hand. "Oh, dearest, let us go to the cave--let
us go to the cave on the hill!"
Castracane felt his friend trembling. Trembling is infectious; he began
to tremble too.

"Yes, yes, we will go to our cave," he agreed in a quick whisper.

CYMON FINDS HIS IPHIGENIA
They struggled upwards through the bushwood and starry flowers.

It was a scented night, the air heavy with the burden of midsummer.

The fireflies spread a jewelled web before their faces, great white moths
flapped and droned about them. On they pushed, their hands locked
through all hazards of brake or briar: neither would let go for a whole
world, but Silvestro was always in front, leading Castracane for this
once. One knew the way as well as another; but Silvestro led it. They
rounded the hill-top.

"Here we are at last," said Silvestro. "Let us sit here, and look at the
splendour of the night. Oh, Pilade! Oh, dear friend!

How couldst thou do so much for me?"

"What else could I do?" said he gruffly. "You never killed the pig-Jew."

"Nor did you, Pilade. Tell me why you gave yourself up."
"Because you didn't do it, of course."

"But you didn't do it either?"
"Well, but I knocked you down."
"Did you do it because of that; or because--because you like me?"
Pilade grunted. "Suppose I did?"
Silvestro sighed, and leaned his head on his friend's shoulder.

"O wondrous night!" said he, whispering. "Look, the stars are like moons."

It was certainly a wonderful night--a night of enormous silence, of great
steady stars, of gold-dusted air, of a sky like a purple dome
encrusted with jewelled lights.

The two boys sat together, blinking at so much speechless glory.
Castracane's arm was round his fellow's shoulder; that fellow's
lips parted, and his breath came soft and eager--yet too quickly
for ease. It was certainly a night of wonder.

Castracane's arm slipped down to Silvestro's waist; Silvestro sighed,
and snuggled into the haven it made.

"O holy night!" said he. "Now might miracles happen, and we be by."

"Ah," said Castracane, "the miracle of choice would be an angel with a
basket of bread and cheese--or a beautiful maiden to come and lie in
one's arms."

Silvestro thrilled. Castracane gave a responsive squeeze, and went on.

"I am not too sure, you must know, that one has not happened already.
To see you lead that signore by the nose! You came swimming among the
tree-stems like an angel. You might have knocked me down with a
feather.
And how he kissed your hand! Miracles! Why, if you had been the
maiden I dream about, he couldn't have been more respectful. If you
want miracles, for example!"
"I do want them, Pilade. I want them very much." Silvestro sighed
again, and leaned his cheek till it touched his friend's.

A shock transfused Castracane; he was caught by the starry influences.
Suddenly he turned his mouth towards that blushing flower, and kissed
Silvestro. Silvestro thrilled but lay close.

"Buon' Dio, ecco miracolo!" said Castracane hoarsely, and kissed
again.

Again his nestling companion gave no sign but a quiver.

Castracane surveyed the stars. "A miracle has certainly happened," he said.
"I feel very queer. My head swims, fingers and toes tingle; I seem
to have hot lead in my legs.

It may be that I am empty. I think it is a miracle; but as yet I see
no angel."
Some quicker thrill of what he held made him look at Silvestro. At the
same moment Silvestro slowly turned his head, and looked at him. What
each saw in the other's face beyond a white moon-shape, what shining
of truth in the eye, what expectancy, what revelation in the lips, I
know not. Two pair of lips, at least, met and stayed together.

"O Dio!"
"Oh, Pilade! Oh, carissimo!" She abandoned herself to joy.

"_You_ are the angel, the miracle! You are--"
"No, no, I am not an angel; but oh, I love you, dearly!"
"Ah, la Madonna!"
"I am Ippolita! I love you!"

"You love me? You are mine then--come."
"Andrea," said Castracane next morning, "I think the others will be back
before noon. You must wait here till they come. I am going to take
Silvestro over La Venda to see my mother, and confess to our curate.

It is good for the soul."
"Silvestro looks well this morning," said Andrea, with his mouth full of
bread. "What a colour of dawn! What shining eyes! He would make a
proper Madonna for a Mystery--eh?"
"He would," said Castracane laconically; "a most proper Madonna. With a
_Bambino_ on his lap--eh, Silvestro."
Silvestro blushed; Castracane pinched his cheek, which made matters
worse.

They took the road together through the deep hedges of the valley. Monte
Venda rose before them, dark with woods. Castracane's arm was round
Silvestro's waist: every twenty yards they stopped.

"To think of it!" cried Castracane, on one of these breathless halts.

"You to be like any one of us--breeched, clouted, swathed--and a
lovely lass within your shirt--Madonna!"
"Do you think me lovely?" asked Ippolita devoutly. "I have heard
that till I have been sick to death of it; but from you I shall
never be tired of knowing it."

"Blessed Angel!"
"Oh, Pilade, my love!"
They loitered on.

"You see that I am not what you thought me," said Ippolita, with an arch
look. "You thought I had killed a Jew."
"Never, per Bacco!" cried Castracane. "That I'll swear to."
"You thought I was a boy, even last night, dearest."
But that he denied. "Santissimo! Did I treat you like a boy, I ask you?"

"You knocked me down once, Pilade."
"Every honest man knocks his wife down once," said Pilade gravely.

"And then you kissed me."
"I can kiss you again," said Pilade; and did.

I repeat, Padua is a freakish city. The Sub-Prefect writes madrigals
in vain. Castracane, the goatherd, sends Silvestro sprawling, and wins
the golden Ippolita for a willing bride. What are we to make of it? _Deus
nobis hæc otia fecit._

BOCCA BACIATA

"Not unprosperous is your Erasmus in England," wrote that man of wiles
to one Faustus, a poet; and then--"To touch upon one among many delights,
there are girls in this land divinely fair--soft, easy, and more
wooing than any of your Muses. Moreover, they have a custom which cannot
be too much honoured.

Wheresoever you go a-visiting, the girls all kiss you. With kisses you
come in, with kisses depart; returning, they kiss you again. Cometh
one to you, the kisses fly between; doth she go away, with kisses
you are torn asunder; meeting in any place, kisses abound.

Go where you will, it is all kisses. Indeed, my Faustus, had you but once
tasted of lips so fragrant and so soft, not for a time only,
but to your end of days, you would choose to be a pilgrim in this
England." By no means the only stranger to be charmed by our welcoming
girls was Erasmus.

Amilcare Passavente, of a darker blood, found such kisses sweet: those
of one at least he vowed to call his own. What he made of them, what
they of him, what other diverting matter appertains to the kisser
and the kissed, you shall understand who care to read.

Mary was her name in our Lord, Lovel that of her father in the flesh,
a respectable wharfinger of Bankside. Molly, Mawkin, Moll Lovel, "Long
Moll Lovel," and other things similar she was to her kinsfolk and
acquaintance, who had seen her handsome body outstrip her simple
mind.
Good girl that she was, she carried her looks as easily as a packet
of groceries about the muddy ways of Wapping, went to church, went to
market, gossiped out the dusk at the garden gate, or on the old wharf,
after the 'prentices had gone, linked herself waist to waist with
maiden friends. Up river or down, she trafficked in a wherry, and
took the waterman's tender glances as part receipt for his hire. In a
word, this winsome, rosy creature, grown hardy in a kind soil, adventured
herself at ease among them that might have been her poets, adorers, or
raveners, nor thought to be cheapened by the liberty she employed.
She was rather shy with strangers, conscious of her height,
awkward under observation, blushing to know she blushed; but simple
as the day, pleased with flattery, pleased with other trifles,--trinkets,
snatched kisses, notes slipped into the prayer-book, etc. She told
her mother everything before she went to bed, sat on her father's knee
when she was too old and much too tall for it, dreamed of lovers,
hid trembling when they came, had palpitations, never told a fib or
refused a sweetmeat; she was, in fact, just the honest, red-cheeked,
pretty, shy simpleton of a lass you will meet by the round dozen in our
country, who grows into the plump wife of Master Church-warden-in-broadcloth,
bears a half-score children, gets flushed after midday dinner, and would
sooner miss church than the postman any day in the year. Such was
Molly Lovel at nineteen, honestly handsome and honestly a fool, whom
in Bankside they knew as Long-legged Moll.

To Amilcare Passavente, the young merchant-adventurer from Leghorn, ravished
as he was by the spell of her cool lips, she became at once "La divina
Maria," or shorter, "La Diva"; and in a very light space of time, when
his acquaintance with her and hers with his tongue had ripened, she
had quite a nosegay of names: Madonna Collebianca (my Lady Whitethroat),
Donna Fiordispina, La Bella Rosseggiante, were three among three
dozen flowers of speech, picked from a highly scented garden of
such for her adorning.

Amilcare translated them in his hoarse, eager voice, helped on by his
hands (which were rapid) and his beseeching eyes (which had the flattery
of deference), not only to Molly apart, but to all or any of her
acquaintance who could listen without giggling.

Molly pressed her bosom; her friends, as they loitered home, said in each
other's ears, "Blessed Lord, what will become of Gregory Drax?" Gregory
Drax was the broad-girthed young master of a trading-smack which coasted
between London and Berwick, and was even at that hour in Kirkley Roads,
standing off Yarmouth.

All a summer this endured, but went no further while Amilcare, new to
the blunt ways of the English, was unable to stomach their cropped speech
any better than their sour beer. Those who heard his florid paraphrase
took it gravely, yet held by their "Moll Lovel." They wished that Gregory
Drax might have a fair wind home; they wondered what Master Lovel
was about; trusted that the black-eyed rascal (whose speech was too
glib, surely, to be honest) would not make a fool of the girl.

He very soon showed them that, whatever else he did, he intended to make
a woman of her. Let them hold, said he (for once expressing his
contempt), to their "Molly Lovel"--the name was the Shadow. He would
hold, as at that moment he was very devoutly holding, Molly herself--aha!
the blessed Substance. And when the young Molly let herself go whither
her soft desires had long since fled; when she felt the heart of
Amilcare jumping against hers, his cheek, his lips, his soft
syllabling, her own breathless replies--then at last Amilcare, quite
enraptured, finding everything about her wonder and delight, made
shift to catch up some waft of her very tongue, closer savour of
her very home, and called her on high his adorable, his unending,
his altogether soul-devastating, destroying mistress, "Madonna
Mollavella."

Good Master Lovel the wharfinger neither knew his daughter nor his
father's name in this long-drawn compound of liquids; he was troubled,
very doubtful, anxious for Gregory Drax; but all Lombardy and the
Emilian March came to know it in time. Amilcare rode down opposition.
Eloquence! Were ever such cries to great Heaven, such invitations to
Olympus, slappings of the forehead, punchings of ribs, in Wapping
before? Molly in tears on her mother's breast, Amilcare on his knees,
the neighbours at the door:
Master Lovel, good man, abominated such scenes.

Father Pounce married them at St. Saviour's in Southwark; money abounded,
the dowry passed from hand to hand. On a gusty November morning
there sailed out of the London river the barque _Santa Fina_ of Leghorn,
having on board Amilcare Passavente and Donna Maria his wife, bound (as
all believed) for that port, and thence by long roads to their country
of adoption--not Pisa, nor Lucca, nor any place Tuscan; but Nona in
the March of Emilia. No; Erasmus was not the only traveller whirled
about by English kisses, nor Molly Lovel the only simple witch in turn
bewitched.

II

AMILCARE: COMMERCE AND THE AFFECTIONS

Molly was a handsome fool: let there be no doubt about that. There was
no romance in her, though sentiment enough. She lacked the historic sense;
and if she thought of Rome at all, supposed it a collocation of warehouses,
jetties, and a church or two--an unfamiliar Wapping upon a river with
a long name. Her sensations on the voyage were those of sea-sickness,
on the golden-hazy Campagna those of home-sickness unaffected. Affectation
of any sort was far from her.

If she was happy she showed her white teeth, if wretched she either pouted
or cried; if she liked you there were kisses, if she distrusted you she
grew red. But she distrusted no one. Why should she? Since every act of
hers was, in seeming, a caress of personal intention, every one loved
her. As for her husband, when he was not sacramentally engaged, he
mutely raved to the stars, protesting by his dimmed eyes, moving lips,
and strained-out arms how every breath she took was to him also an
inspiration. Her frankness, the truth lucent in her eyes, her abounding
receptivity,--for she believed everything she was told and objected to
nothing,--her sweet long body, the tired grace with which she carried
her lovely head, her tender, stroking ways, the evenness of her temper
(which only that of her teeth could surpass),--all this threatened
to make of Amilcare a poet or a saint, something totally disparate
to his immediate proposals.

His nature saved him for the game which his nature had taught him.

In that great game he had to play Molly (though he loved her dearly)
must be, he saw, his prime counter. Coming to England to negotiate
bills of exchange, he had Molly thrown in. She would do more for
him than rose-nobles. He ecstatised over his adorable capture; but
saw no reason in that why he should not lay it out to advantage.
It would not cheapen in the chaffer; on the contrary, give him the
usufruct for a few years, and he would be not only the happiest but
the most considerable of men.
Triumphant Bacchus! (so he mused to himself) what had he not gained?
A year's pay for his men, the confidence of the "Signori" of Nona,
the acclamations of the Piazza and the Council Chamber at once--and
Molly Lovel. Hey! that was best of all. For her sake, and by her
means, he would be Capitano del Popolo. What else? That would do
for a beginning.
If Molly could turn his head, she could turn other heads, he supposed.
A turned head meant a disponable body, a bending back, an obsequious
knee, even a carcase at a quick hand's discretion; votes in Council,
delirium in the Piazza, _Te Deum_ in the Church. Amilcare knew his
countrymen: he that knows them half as well will have no trouble
in conceiving how these trade-calculations can consist with a great
deal of true love.
And what was Amilcare's trade? His trade was politics, the stock
whereof was the people of Nona, the shifty, chattering, light-weight
spawn of one of those little burnt-brick and white cities of the
Lombard Plain--set deep in trees, domed, belfried, full of gardens
and fountains and public places--which owed their independence to
being too near a pair of rival states to be worth either's conquering.
There were some score of these strewn over Southern Emilia and
Romagna in those days, and the time was almost at hand, and with
it the man, to sweep them all into one common net of wretchedness.
But Amilcare had no clear thought of that. For the moment Nona was
as peaceful as Forlì, or Rimini, or Pesaro, or Faenza, thanks to
him and his "Centaurs"--that famous band of free riders he had
levied from the Tuscan hills. Very much at his mercy, safe under
the eye of his trusted Secretary, awaiting his return, he fully
intended that peace to continue when she fell huddling to him. It
would, indeed, be his care; for it was a maxim of Italian politics
that no man willingly stirs after dinner.
The situation was still pretty delicate; he had done little more
than win foothold. In the late struggles with Parma he had intrigued
with great address; sold himself and his Centaurs to Farnese, brought
that thick-necked hero up to the very walls of Nona, then (in the
nick of time) resold himself at double the price to the city he was
besieging, and routed his yesterday's master by an attack in flank
just as the Nonesi were carrying the trenches in front. In the
excitement of that wonderful hour--Farnese in full flight, himself
borne on men's shoulders round the Piazza, thanksgiving in the
cathedral, clouds of incense, clashing bells, wine running in the
Fontana delle Grazie--he had for a moment been tempted to believe
the times ripe for a proclamation:
"Amilcar, Dei Gratia, Nonarum Dux," etc. He had his treble wages
in his pocket, the hearts of the whole city throbbing at his feet.
He was a young man: tempted he certainly was. But Grifone (the
Secretary) touched his elbow and showed a straightened lip. He would
not risk it. He contented himself with a footing, the Palazzo
Bagnacavallo rent-free, and the title of "Gonfalonerius Populorum
Libertatis," which looked passably well about a broad seal. "Pater
Patriae," "Nonarum Dux," the control of the bread-tax,--all should
be added to him in time, if only the Borgia could be fed elsewhere.
At the thought of that hearty eater stalled in the Vatican, he felt
that he might indeed thank God for his lovely Molly. With her for
decoy even that game-bird might be lured.
Lying on the poop of the _Santa Fina_, his dark eyes questing over
her face, her hands among his curls, he seemed to Molly the wonder
of the world.Otherwise, our generosity is mere sentimentality. And it does no
good even to the person on whom we lavish it. Perhaps justice in its
highest sense includes generosity. It is just that the rich should help
the poor, and more truly generous to give with that thought than with
the feeling that one has done something meritorious in giving. It is
also mere justice that in dealing with our fellow-creatures we should
always think of them as they may be, as they ought to be, and not to
remember simply what they are. Our faith in them helps them to rise, but
not our pretense that they are right when they are wrong.

After all, however, who is perfectly balanced? There are worthy women
who have all their feelings well in hand, who are pleasant to live with,
and who do an immense amount of good in the world, and yet who never
rise above common-placeness, and never lift anybody else much above the
material plane. And there are other women so ardent and generous and
loving that they seem to lend wings to everybody they meet, who are yet
crushed and ruined themselves by the excess of their grief not only for
their own sorrows, but for those of the whole world, until by and by
they drag their dearest and most sympathetic friends down into the same
abyss of woe.

How shall we keep the true balance? I believe that it always is kept by
religious faith, though that too is frequently distorted. The one thing
necessary to believe is that a good God rules the universe. There is no
limit to the love we may give to such a being or to the creatures He
has made, and there is no sorrow which cannot be comforted by the
thought that love underlies it, and that it has a meaning though we
cannot see it, and there is nothing else which is so sure a spur to
duty.

Even this simple creed, however, is not possible to all of us. The
upheavals in religious beliefs which this century has seen reach even
emotional women and unthinking girls. We cannot believe a thing simply
because we should like to believe it. Without this one article of faith,
I believe happiness to be impossible, but we need not fail in our duty.
A noble woman whose beautiful life is a benediction to all about her,
but whose suffering has been intense, says that as her life has been an
exceptionally favored one, it is impossible for her to believe in God.
But she adds, "Though things are not for the best, we must make the best
of them. We can always lighten somebody's burden." Norwood Press J.

MADONNA OF THE PEACH-TREE

I
VANNA IS BID FOR

Not easily would you have found a girl more winning in a tender sort than
Giovanna Scarpa of Verona at one and twenty, fair-haired and flushed,
delicately shaped, tall and pliant, as she then was. She had to suffer
her hours of ill report, but passes for near a saint now, in
consequence of certain miracles and theophanies done on her account,
which it is my business to declare; before those she was considered
(if at all) as a girl who would certainly have been married three
years ago if dowries had not been of moment in the matter.

In a city of maids as pretty as they are modest--which no one will
deny Verona to be--there may have been some whose charms in either
kind were equal to hers, while their estate was better in accord; but
the speculation is idle.
Giovanna, flower in the face as she was, fit to be nosegay on any hearth,
posy for any man's breast, sprang in a very lowly soil. Like a
blossoming reed she shot up to her inches by Adige, and one forgot
the muddy bed wondering at the slim grace of the shaft with its
crown of yellow atop. Her hair waved about her like a flag; she should
have been planted in a castle; instead, Giovanna the stately calm,
with her billowing line, staid lips, and candid grey eyes, was to be
seen on her knees by the green water most days of the week. Bare-armed,
splashed to the neck, bare-headed, out-at-heels, she rinsed and
pommelled, wrung and dipped again, laughed, chattered, flung her
hair to the wind, her sweat to the water, in line with a dozen other
women below the Ponte Navi; and if no one thought any the worse of her,
none, unhappily, thought any the better--at least in the way of marriage.
It is probable that no one thought of her at all. Giovanna was a beauty
and a very good girl; but she was a washerwoman for all that, whose
toil fed seven mouths.

Her father was Don Urbano, curate of Santa Toscana across the
water.
This may very easily sound worse than it is. In Don Urbano's day, though
a priest might not marry, he might have a wife--a faithful, diligent
companion, that is--to seethe his polenta, air his linen, and rear his
children. The Church winked at her, and so continued until the
Jesuits came to teach that winking was unbecoming. But when Can Grande
II.
lorded in Verona the Jesuits did not, and Don Urbano, good, easy man,
cared not who winked at his wife.

She gave him six children before she died of the seventh, of whom the
eldest was Giovanna, and the others, in an orderly chain diminishing
punctually by a year, ran down to Ferrantino, a tattered, shock-headed
rascal of more inches than grace.

Last of all the good drudge, who had borne these and many other burdens
for her master, died also. Don Urbano was never tired of saying how
providential it was that she had held off her demise until Giovanna
was old enough to take her place. The curate was fat and lazy,
very much interested in himself; his stipend barely paid his
shot at the "Fiore del Marinajo," under whose green bush he was mostly
to be seen. Vanna had to roll up her sleeves, bend her straight young
back, and knee the board by the Ponte Navi. I have no doubt it did her
good; the work is healthy, the air, the sun, the waterspray kissed her
beauty ripe; but she got no husband because she could save no dowry.
Everything went to stay the seven crying mouths.

Then, on a day when half her twenty-first year had run after the others,
old Baldassare Dardicozzo stayed on the bridge to rest from the burden
of his pack--on a breezy March morning when the dust filled his eyes and
the wind emptied him of breath. Baldassare had little enough to spare
as it was. So he dropped his load in the angle of the bridge,
with a smothered "Accidente!" or some such, and leaned to watch the
swollen water buffeted crosswise by the gusts, or how the little
mills amid-stream dipped as they swam breasting the waves.

In so doing he became aware, in quite a peculiar way, of Vanna
Scarpa.

Baldassare was old, red-eyed, stiff in the back. Possibly he was rheumatic,
certainly he was grumpy. He had a long slit mouth which played him a
cruel trick; for by nature it smiled when by nature he was most
melancholy. Smile it would and did, however cut-throat he felt: if you
wanted to see him grin from ear to ear you would wait till he had had
an ill day's market. Then, while sighs, curses, invocations of the saints,
or open hints to the devil came roaring from him, that hilarious mouth
of his invited you to share delights. You had needs laugh
with him, and he, cursing high and low, beamed all over his face.
"To make Baldassare laugh" became a stock periphrasis for the supreme
degree of tragedy among his neighbours. About this traitor mouth of
his he had a dew of scrubby beard, silvered black; he had bushy eyebrows,
hands and arms covered with a black pelt: he was a very hairy man. Also
he was a very warm man, as everybody knew, with a hoard of florins
under the flags of his old-clothes shop in the Via Stella.

Having spat into the water many times, rubbed his hands, mopped his head,
and cursed most things under heaven and some in it, Master
Baldassare found himself watching the laundresses on the shore. They were
the usual shrill, shrewd, and laughing line--the trade seems to induce
high mirth--and as such no bait for the old merchant by ordinary; but
just now the sun and breeze together made a bright patch of them, set
them at a provoking flutter. Baldassare, prickly with dust, found them
like their own cool linen hung out to dance itself dry in the wind.
Most of all he noticed Vanna, whom he knew well enough, because when she
knelt upright she was taller and more wayward than the rest, and because
the wind made so plain the pretty figure she had. She was very industrious,
but no less full of talk: there seemed so much to say! The pauses were
frequent in which she straightened herself from the hips and turned to
thrust chin and voice into the debate.

You saw then the sharp angle, the fine line of light along that raised
chin, the charming turn of the neck, her free young shoulders and
shapely head; also you marked her lively tones of _ci_ and _si_,
and how her shaking finger drove them home. The wind would catch her
yellow hair sometimes and wind it across her bosom like a scarf; or
it streamed sideways like a long pennon; or being caught by a gust from
below, sprayed out like a cloud of litten gold. Vanna always joined in
the laugh at her mishap, tossed her tresses back, pinned them up (both
hands at the business); and then, with square shoulders and elbows stiff
as rods, set to working the dirt out of Don Urbano's surplice.
Baldassare brooded, chewing straws. What a clear colour that girl had,
to be sure! What a lissom rascal it was! A fine long girl like that
should be married; by all accounts she would make a man a good wife.
If he were a dozen years the better of four and fifty he might--Then came
a shrug, and a "Ma!" to conclude in true Veronese Baldassare's
ruminations. Shrug and explosion signalled two stark facts:
Baldassare was fifty-four, and Vanna had no portion.

Yet he remained watching on the bridge, his chin buried in his knotty
hands, his little eyes blinking under stress of the inner fire he had.

So it befell that La Testolina saw him, and said something shrill and
saucy to her neighbour. The wind tossed him the tone but not the
sense.
He saw the joke run crackling down the line, all heads look brightly up.
The joke caught fire; he saw the sun-gleam on a dozen perfect sets of
teeth. Vanna's head was up with the rest, sooner up and the sooner
down. Even from that height the little twinkling beacons from the bridge
shot her through. He saw her colour deepen, head droop; she was busy
long before the others had wrung their joke dry. "Soul of a cat!"
grunted Baldassare between his teeth, "what a rosy baggage it is!"
He waited a little longer, then deliberately passed the bridge, rounded
the pillar by the steps, and went down to the women like a man who has
made up his mind. Lizabetta of the roving eye caught the first hint
of his shadow. Her elbow to Nonna's ribs, Nonna's "Pst!" in Nina's
ear, spread the news. Vanna's cheeks flew the flag.

"Buon' giorno, Ser Baldassare!" shrilled La Testolina, plump and black-eyed
leader of mischief.

"Giorno, giorno, La Testolina," growled the old man.

Vanna, very busy, grew as red as a rose.

The others knelt back on their heels; compliments of a homely sort
flew about, sped on by flashing teeth. Baldassare's own were black as old
channel-posts in the Lagoon, but in tongue-work he gave as sharp as he
got. Then a wicked wind blew Vanna's hair like a whip across her
throat, fit to strangle her. She had to face the day. Baldassare pondered
her straight young back.

"When Vanna's a nun she'll have no more trouble with her hair," quoth
La Testolina, matchmaker by race.

"When Vanna's a nun the river will be dry," said Vanna from between her
elbows.

"When Vanna's a nun the river, on the contrary, will be in flood." This
from Baldassare.

"Hey! what's this?" Caterina cried; and Nonna pinched her arm.

"Adige will go crying that she comes no more to dip her arms," said the
old man, with the utmost gravity and a broad grin. The women
screamed their delight, slapped their knees, or raised witnessing hands
to heaven; La Testolina caught Vanna round the waist and gave her a
resounding kiss.

"Compliments, my little Vanna, compliments!" Her voice pealed like a
trumpet.

"Vi ringrazio, signore," said Vanna under her breath, and La Testolina
held up a tress of her long hair to the light.

"When Vanna's a nun you would bid for that, eh, Baldassare?"
"I will bid for whatever she will sell me," says he, with a blink.
Whereupon the matchmaker made no more music. The scent was too hot
for that.

Yet for all his adventuring he got little reward; she turned him no more
than the round of her cheek. Vanna never stayed her work, and he, ordinarily
a silent man, paid no more compliments--yet ceased not to look.

Going up the street at dinner-time, he made his bid. He limped by the
tall girl's side without speech from either; but at the door he looked
up queerly at her and pinched her ear.

"Go in and feed the youngsters, my chuck," said he; "I know where to
meet Don Urbano, and please Madonna you shall feed your own before
long."
"Yes, Ser Baldassare," says pretty Vanna in a twitter.

The conference between the high contracting parties was wordy, bristled
with the gesticulations of two pair of hands, and was commented on
by all the guests in the "Fiore del Marinajo." The girl, said Don
Urbano, was the very pride of his eye, prop of his failing years,
a little mother to the children.

She had had a most pious bringing-up, never missed the Rosary, knew the
Little Hours of the Virgin, could do sums with notches in a stick, market
like a Jew's housekeeper, sew like a nun, and make a stew against any
wife in the _contrada_. Dowry, dowry!
What did such a girl as that want with a dowry? She was her own dowry,
by Bacchus the Thracian. Look at the shape of her--was that not a
dowry?
The work she could do, the pair of shoulders, the deep chest, the long
legs she had--pick your dowry there, my friends! A young woman of her
sort carried her dowry on her back, in her two hands, in her
mouth--ah!
and in what she could put into yours, by our Lord. Rather, it should
be the other way. What, now, was Ser Baldassare prepared to lay out
upon such a piece of goods? Baldassare shivered, grinned fearfully, and
shook his head many times. Money was money; it was limited; it bore its
value in plain figures upon its face: you knew where you were with money.
But you could get wives cheaper than ducats, and find them cheaper
value, soul of a cat! Besides, what was he? A poor pedlar, by his
faith! At this he spread out his arms and dropped them with a flop
upon his knees.
The priest sat back in his chair and cast appealing looks at the
rafters; the company chuckled, nudged each other, guffawed.

Baldassare was made to feel that he had over-coloured his case. True, he
admitted, he had a roof over his head, shared fortune with the rats
in that. But look at the thing reasonably, comrades. Vanna would make
another to keep; a girl of her inches must be an eater, body of a
dog! Had his reverence thought of that? His reverence made a supreme
effort, held up one pudgy forefinger, and with the other marked off
two joints of it.
"Of mortadella so much," he said; "of polenta so much"--and he shut
one fist; "of pasta so much"--and he coupled the two fists; "and
of wine, by the soul of the world, not enough to drown a flea! I
tell you, Baldassare," he said finally, emboldened by the merchant's
growing doubt--"I tell you that you ask of me a treasure which I
would not part with for a cardinal's hat. No indeed! Not to be
Bishop of Verona, throned and purfled on Can Grande's right hand,
will I consent to traffic my Vanna. Eh, _sangue di Sangue_, because
I am a man of the Church must I cease to be a man of bowels, to
have a yearning, a tender spot here?" He prodded his cushioned ribs.
"Go you, Ser Baldassare Dardicozzo," he cried, rising grandly in
his chair--"go you; you have mistaken your man. The father stands
up superb in the curate's cassock, and points the door to the
chafferer of virgins!"
The tavern-room, on Don Urbano's side to a man, beat the tables
with their glasses; Baldassare had to surrender at discretion. The
bargain, finally struck, was written out by an obliging notary on
the scoring-slate. In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity
it was declared to all men living and to be born, that Baldassare
Dardicozzo, merchant of Verona, was obliged to pay to the reverend
father in God, Urbano, curate of Santa Toscana in the Borgo San
Giorgio, the sum of sixty florins Veronese and two barrels of wine
of Val Pulicella, under condition that if within thirty days from
those presents he did not lead in marriage Giovanna, daughter of
the said reverend, he should be bound to pay the sum of one hundred
and twenty florins Veronese, and four barrels of wine of Val
Pulicella.
The notary executed a monstrous flourish at the bottom--a foliated
cross rising out of steps. On the last step he wrote his own name,
Bartolo de Thomasinis; and then Baldassare, smiling as he should,
but feeling as he should not, stuck his seal upon the swimming wax,
and made a cross with the stile like the foundations of a spider's
web.
The affair was thus concluded; before the thirty days were up Vanna
was taken to church by her father, and taken from it by her new
master.
Within a week she appeared at the doorway of Baldassare's little
shop, very pretty, very sedate, quite the housewife--to sit there
sewing and singing to herself from grey dawn to grey dusk.
II 
_TERTIUM QUID_
A year passed, two years passed. Vanna was three and twenty, no
more round but no less blooming in face and figure; still a reedy,
golden-haired girl. But Baldassare was fifty-seven, and there was
no sign of issue. The neighbours, who had nudged each other at one
season, whose heads had wagged as their winks flew about, now
accepted the sterile mating as of the order of things. Pretty Vanna,
mother as she had been to her brothers and sisters, was to be a
mother no more. There was talk of May and December. Baldassare was
advised to lock up other treasure beside his florins; some, indeed,
of the opposite camp gave hints none too honest to the forlorn young
wife. The Piazza Sant' Anastasia at the falling-in of the day, for
instance. Thus they put it.
All girls--and what else was Vanna, a wife in name?--walked there
arm in arm. Others walked there also, she must know.But though,
as now constituted, its exactions are so heavy that it often seems as if
it must be all or nothing, it need not inevitably be so. Society could
be so conducted as to be a beautiful recreation instead of a business,
and those who see this clearly can help to bring it about.

Society ought to give enjoyment in a refined way. Beautiful houses,
beautiful dresses, music, cultivated voices in conversation, delicate
wit, smiling faces, graceful dancing, all these things would make up an
attractive picture to most of us if we could forget ourselves, and not
feel that our shadow was the most prominent part of it. It could not
take the place of our serious daily life, but it ought to supplement it.

The French writer Amiel has given the most beautiful description of
ideal society, and I will quote it here. It would, I think, be a good
plan for every girl who wishes to give up society to consider this
picture well. If society were always like this, would you wish to give
it up? If it is not like this, may it not be possible for you to help to
make it so? Is there any better work laid ready to your hand? If so, do
it, by all means. If not, is not this well worth doing?


It is thus that Amiel describes a small evening party: "Thirty people of
the best society, a happy mingling of sexes and ages. Gray heads, young
people, _spirituelle_ faces. All framed in tapestries of Aubusson which
gave a soft distance and a charming background to the groups in full
dress.... The peculiar avidity with which they one and all appear determined
to secure the salaries for their various suppositionary services,
must convince the most sceptical that they have carefully studied the
art of drawing.

THE LABOURS OF THE SESSION.

None but Ministers know what Ministers go through for the pure love
of their country; no person who has not reposed in the luxuriously-cushioned
chairs of the Treasury or Downing-street can conceive the amount
of business Sir Robert and his colleagues have transacted during
the three months they have been in office.

The people, we know, have been crying for bread--the manufacturers are
starving--but their rebellious appetites will be appeased--their
refractory stomachs will feel comforted, when they are told all that
their friends the Tories have been doing for them. How will they
blush for their ingratitude when they find that the following great
measures have been triumphantly carried through Parliament by Sir
Robert's exertions--The VENTILATING OF THE HOUSE BILL!

Think of that, ye thin-gutted weavers of Manchester. Drop down
on your marrow-bones, and bless the man who gives your
representatives fresh air--though he denies you--a mouthful of coarse
food. Then look at his next immense boon--The ROYAL KITCHEN-GARDEN BILL!
What matters it that the gaunt fiend Famine sits at your board,
when you can console yourselves with the reflection that cucumbers
and asparagus will be abundant in the Royal Kitchen Garden!

But Sir Robert does not stop here.

What follows next?

--The FOREIGN BISHOPS' BILL! See how our spiritual wants are cared for
by your tender-hearted Tories--they shudder at the thoughts of
Englishmen being fed on foreign corn; but they give them instead,
a full supply of Foreign Bishops.

After that comes--The REPORT OF THE LUNATICS' BILL. This important
document has been founded on the proceedings in the Upper House, and
is likely to be of vast service to the nation at large.

Next follows the EXPIRING LAWS' BILL! We imagine that a slight
error has been made in the title of this bill, and that it should be
read "Expiring _Justice_ Bill!" As to expiring laws--'tis all a fallacy.
One of the glorious privileges of the English Constitution is, that the
laws never expire--neither do the lawyers--they are everlasting.
Justice may die in this happy land, but law--never!

Again, there is a little grant of some thousands for Prince Albert's stables
and dog-kennels! Very proper too; these animals must be lodged,
ay, and fed; and the people--the creatures whom God made after his
own image--the poor wretches who want nothing but a little bread, will
lie down hungry and thankful, when they reflect that the royal dogs and
horses are in the best possible condition. But we have not yet
mentioned the great crowning work of Ministers--the Queen's speech on
the Prorogation of the Parliament last week. What an admirable illustration
it was of that profound logical deduction--that, out of nothing comes
nothing! Yet it was deduction--that, out of nothing comes nothing! Yet
it was not altogether without design, and though some sneering critics
have called the old song--the burthen of it was clearly--

SO MUCH FOR BUCKINGHAM!

MR. SILK BUCKINGHAM being unmercifully reproached by his unhappy
publisher upon the dreadful weight of his recent work on America,
fortunately espied the youngest son of the enraged and disappointed
vendor of volumes actually flying a kite formed of a portion of the
first volume.But I
am sure no circumstances could make a life inspired with such a feeling
a narrow one.

Fortunately few people are so hemmed in by circumstances. But some of us
think a single misfortune enough to crush us. How, for instance, is a
woman prostrated by disease to make anything of the little life within
her four walls?

I remember a woman who broke down at school and suffered so frequently
from violent hemorrhages all her life, which was prolonged till she was
nearly fifty, that she was seldom able to leave her room. Her home was
on a farm a long distance from the village, so that it at first seemed
as if she could not have even the ordinary alleviation of cheerful
society in her more comfortable days. Another aggravation in her case
was that she had an active temperament and strong mind. She had been
fitting herself to be a teacher, and she had just the qualities which
would have made her an admirable teacher, a clear intellect, quick
observation, firm will, love of children, and a perfectly serene temper.
She had wished to teach, partly because she thought she should find it
an inspiring work, and partly because she wished to help the family. She
saw this was not to be, that in spite of herself she must be a burden on
the family. She met her altered circumstances with the same firm will
and cheerful temper she had shown from childhood. If she must be a
burden on others she would make that burden as light as she could. But
La Testolina's eyes were like pin-points, centring all her alarms.

"You must come to the Carmelites, Vanna. There is a great to-do. The
warden of San Francesco has been to the bishop, and the bishop is with
Can Grande at this moment. You must come, indeed, at once--_subitissimo_!"

Vanna laughed--the rich quiet laugh of a girl whose affairs are in good
train, and all other affairs the scratch of a flea.

"Why, what have I to do with the bishop and Can Grande, La Testolina?"
says she. "My master is out, and I must mind the shop.

There is baby too."
"By Saints Pan and Silvanus, my girl, it will be the worse for you if
you come not," said La Testolina, with a tragic sniff. "Eh, you little
fool, don't you know that it is you and your brat have set all Verona by
the ears?"
Vanna had never thought of the ears of Verona, and knew not how to think
of them now; but she saw that her friend was in a fever of suppressed
knowledge. Therefore she shawled her head and her baby in her sea-blue
cloak, locked the shop-door, and followed La Testolina.

The sealed gates in the white convent wall were barred and double-locked.
A scared brother cocked his eye through the grille to see who was there.

"It is she," hissed La Testolina.

"_Dio mio_, the _causa causans_!" cried he, and let them in through a
cranny. "Follow me, mistresses, and God give good ending to this
adventure," he prayed, as he slippered up the court.

Vanna, blank and smiling, La Testolina with wandering, fearful eyes,
followed.

They found the prior sitting well back in his ebony chair and in
meditation, his chin buried in his hand. Behind him (and behind his
back his hands) was Fra Corinto the pittanciar, pockmarked, thin,
and mortified. He looked the prior's reproach, and was.

"Now, women," said the prior, testily--a fat and flabby old man with a
sour mouth--"now, women, which of you is at the bottom of this
accursed business? Where is the baby? Let me judge for myself."
La Testolina, protesting her remarkable innocence by every quiver of
her head, edged Vanna to the front. Vanna stood up, straight as a
candle, and unveiled her bosom.

"Do you want to see my little son, reverend prior?" she said. "Behold
him here (_Eccololì_)." She held him out proudly in her arms, as if he
were monstrance and she priest.

Now whether it was that motherhood had fired a comely girl with the
beautiful seriousness of a woman, so that she was transfigured before
him; or whether some chance passage of the crossing lights played tricks
with his vision--which it was, or whether it was both, I know not.
He saw, or thought he saw, a tall, smiling lady, hooded in blue over
white, holding up a child; he saw, or thought for a moment that he saw,
the Image of all Mothers displaying the Image of all Sons. His fingers
pattered over his scapular. "Eh, my Lady the Virgin! What dost thou
here, glorifying this place?" As soon as he had said it he might
have known that he was a fool; but Vanna's large grey eyes loomed
upon him to swallow him up, her colour of faint rose glowed over
him and throbbed.

_Vera incessu patuit dea!_ "By her presence ye shall judge her," quoth the
prior to himself, and hid his eyes.

There was a hush upon all the group in the chamber, during
which you could have heard afar off the nasal discords of the brethren
in choir droning through an office. No one spoke. The prior's lips
moved at his prayers; Fra Corinto looked frowningly before him; La
Testolina was fidgety to speak, but dared not; Vanna, her long
form like a ripple of moonlight in the dusk, cooed under her voice to
the baby; he, unheeding cause of so much strife in high places,
held out his pair of puckered hands and crowed to the company. So with
their thoughts: the prior thought he had seen the Holy Virgin; Fra
Corinto thought the prior an old fool; La Testolina hoped his reverence
had not the colic; and Vanna thought of nothing at all.

Fra Corinto it was (looking not for Madonna in a baggage), who, by
discreetly coughing, brought his master back to his senses. The prior
cleared his throat once or twice, looked at the young woman, and felt
quite himself. Ridiculous what tricks a flicker of sunlight will play on
the wisest of men!

"Monna Vanna," said he, "I have not brought you here to judge
between you and my brother Battista, now at discipline in his cell. The
flesh, which he should have tamed, has raised, it appears, a bruised
head for one last spite.

My brother was bitten, and my brother fell into sin.
Whether, as of old, the tempter was the woman, it is sure that, as of old,
the eater was a man. I will not condemn you unheard, lest I incur
reproach in my turn. But our order is in peril; the enemy is abroad,
with Envy, Hatred, and Malice barking on their leashes. What can the
poor sheep do but scatter before the wolves? Fra Battista, his penance
duly done, must leave Verona; and you, my sister, must do penance,
that God be not mocked, nor the Veronese upraised to mock Him."
Of this solemn appeal, Vanna, to all seeming, understood not one word.
True, she blushed a little, but that was because a prior was talking to
her: her honest grey eyes were quite untroubled, her smile as tender
as ever.

She spoke as one deprecating temerity--that she should speak at all to
so great a man--and by no means any judgment.

"I am only a poor girl, reverend prior," said she, "most ignorant and
thick-witted. Pray, what have I and my baby to do with these high matters
of Fra Battista's error?"
The prior grew angry. "Tush, my woman," he grunted, "I beg you to drop the
artless. It is out of place here. Let me look at the youngster."
"Yes, yes, mistress, let us see the child," said Fra Corinto, who croaked
like a nightingale in June.

Vanna moved forward on a light foot. "Willingly, reverend fathers," said
she. "He is a fine child, they all say, and reputed the image of his
father." A sublime utterance, full of humoursome matter, if it had
been a time for humours.

But it was not. La Testolina could not contain her virtuous indignation--for
who is so transcendently righteous as your rascal for once in the
right?

"Hey, woman!" she cried shrilly, "what grossness is this? Do you think
the whole city don't know about you?"
Vanna turned quivering. "And what is it that the whole city knows
but does not say, if you please?"

The prior wagged helplessly his hands. Like Pilate, he would have washed
off the business if he could. He looked at the two women. Eh, by the
Lord! there would be a scene. But the whole thing was too impudent a
fraud: there must be an end of it. He caught Fra Corinto's eyes and raised
his brows. Fra Corinto was his jackal--here was his cue. He went
swiftly to the door, set it open, came back and caught Vanna roughly
by the shoulder.

He turned her shocked face to the open door, and his dry voice
grated horribly upon her ears.

"Out with you, piece!" was what he said; and Vanna reeled.

For a full minute she gaped at him for a meaning; his face taught
the force of his words only too well. She sobbed, threw up her high
head, bent it, like Jesus, for the cross, and fled.

The old porter leered by his open gates. "He! he! They are all outside,"
he chuckled--"Magpies and Dusty-hoods, Parvuses, Minors and Minims,
Benets, and Austins, every cowl in Verona! Come along, my handsome girl,
you must move briskish this day!"
She heard the hoarse muttering of the men, and, a worse poison for
good ears, the shrill venom of the women. Out of the gates she blindly
went, and all the pack opened their music upon her. Stones flew, but
words flew faster and stuck more deep. The mob, as she blundered
through the streets, shuffling, gasping, stumbling at her caught
gown, dry-eyed, open-mouthed, panting her terror, her bewilderment,
her shame and amaze--the mob, I say, dizzied about her like a cloud
of wasps; yet they had in them what wasps have not--voices primed
by hatred to bay her mad.

There was no longer any doubt for her: the pittanciar's word (which had
not been "piece") was tossed from pavement to pavement, from balcony to
balcony, out at every open door, shot like slops from every leaning
casement, and hissed in her ears as it flew.

It was a mad race. The Franciscans tucked up their frocks and discarded
stones, that they might run and shout the more freely. The Dominicans
soon tired: their end was served. The cloistered orders were out
of condition; the secular clergy came to weary of what was, after all,
but a matter for the mendicants.
The common people, however, had the game well in hand. They headed
her off the narrow streets, where safety might have been, and kept her
to the Lung' Adige. Round the great S the river makes she battled her
blind way, trying for nothing, with wits for nothing, without hope, or
understanding, or thought. She ran, a hunted woman, straight before
her, and at last shook off the last of her pursuers by San Zeno. Stumbling
headlong into a little pine-wood beyond the gates, she fell, swooned,
and forgot.

It was near dark when she opened her loaded eyes--that is, there was
no moon, but a great concourse of stars, which kept the night as a long
time of dusk. The baby was awake, too, groping for food and whimpering
a little. She sat up to supply him: though in that act her brain swam,
it is probable the duty saved her. Fearing to faint again, she dared
not allow herself to think; for children must be fed though their
mothers are stoned from the gates.

Vanna nursed him till he dropped asleep, and sat on with her thoughts
and troubles. Happily for her, he had turned these to other roads
than the Lung' Adige. She knew that if he was to be fed again she
must feed also.

V
THE MIRACLE OF THE PEACH-TREE

Directly you were outside the Porta San Zeno the peach-trees
began--acre by acre of bent trunks, whose long branches, tied at the
top, took shapes of blown candle-flames: beyond these was an open
waste of bents and juniper scrub, which afforded certain eatage for
goats.

Here three herd-boys, Luca, Biagio, and Astorre, simple brown-skinned
souls, watched their flocks all the summer night, sleeping, waking
to play pranks with each other, whining endless doggerel, praying
at every scare, and swearing at every reassurance. Simple puppyish folk
though they were, Madonna of the Peach-Tree chose them to witness her
epiphany.

It was a very still night, of wonderful star-shine, but without a
moon.

The stars were so thickly spread, so clear and hot, that there was light
enough for the lads to see each other's faces, the rough shapes of each
other. It was light enough to notice how the square belfry of San Zeno
cut a wedge of black into the spangled blue vault. Sheer through the Milky
Way it ploughed a broad furrow, which ended in a ragged edge. You would
never have seen that if it had not been a clear night.

Still also it was.

You heard the cropping of the goats, the jaws' champ when they chewed
the crisp leaves; the flicker of the bats' wings. In the marsh, half
a mile away, the chorus of frogs, when it swelled up, drowned all
nearer noise; but when it broke off suddenly, those others resumed
their hold upon the stillness.

It was a breathless night of suspense. Anything might happen on such
a night.

Luca, Biagio, and Astorre, under the spell of this marvellous night,
lay on their stomachs alert for alarms. A heavy-wheeling white owl had
come by with a swish, and Biagio had called aloud to Madonna in his
agony.
Astorre had crossed himself over and over again: this was the Angel of
Death cruising abroad on the hunt for goats or goat-herds; but "No,
no!" cried Luca, eldest of the three, "the wings are too short, friends.
That is a fluffy new soul just let loose. She knows not the way,
you see.

Let us pray for her. There are devils abroad on such close nights as this."

Pray they did, with a will, "Ave Maria," "O maris Stella," and half
the Paternoster, when Biagio burst into a guffaw, and gave Luca a
push which sent Astorre down.

"Why, 'tis only a screech-owl, you fools!" he cried, though the sound
of his own voice made him falter; "an old mouse-teaser," he went on in a
much lower voice. "Who's afraid?"
A black and white cat making a pounce had sent hearts to mouths after
this: though they found her out before they had got to "Dominus tecum,"
she left them all in a quiver. It had been a cat, but it might
have been the devil.

Then, before the bristles had folded down on their backs, they rose up
again, and the hair of their heads became rigid as quills.
Over the brow of a little hill, through the peach-trees (which bowed their
spiry heads to her as she walked), came quietly a tall white Lady in a
dark cloak. Hey! powers of earth and air, but this was not to be doubted!
Evenly forward she came, without a footfall, without a rustle or the
crackling of a twig, without so much as kneeing her skirt--stood before
them so nearly that they saw the pale oval of her face, and said in a
voice like a muffled bell, "I am hungry, my friends; have you any
meat?"

She had a face like the moon, and great round eyes; within her cloak, on
the bosom of her white dress, she held a man-child. He, they passed their
sacred word, lifted in his mother's arms and turned open-handed
towards them. Luca, Biagio, and Astorre, goat-herds all and honest
lads, fell on their faces with one accord; with one voice they cried,
"Madonna, Madonna, Madonna! pray for us sinners!"
But again the Lady spoke in her gentle tones. "I am very hungry,
and my child is hungry. Have you nothing to give me?" So then Luca kicked
the prone Biagio, and Biagio's heel nicked Astorre on the shin.
But it was Luca, as became the eldest, who got up first, all the same;
and as soon as he was on his feet the others followed him. Luca took
his cap off, Biagio saw the act and followed it. Astorre, who dared not
lift his eyes, and was so busy making crosses on himself that he had
no hands to spare, kept his on till Luca nudged Biagio, and Biagio cuffed
him soundly, saying, "Uncover, cow-face."
Then Luca on his knees made an offering of cheese and black bread
to the Lady.

They saw the gleam of her white hand as she stretched it out to take the
victual. That hand shone like agate in the dark.

They saw her eat, sitting very straight and noble upon a tussock of
bents.
Astorre whispered to Biagio, Biagio consulted with Luca for a few anxious
moments, and communicated again with Astorre. Astorre jumped up and
scuttled away into the dark. Presently he came back, bearing something
in his two hands. The three shock-heads inspected his burden; there was
much whispering, some contention, almost a scuffle. The truth was,
that Biagio wanted to take the thing from Astorre, and that Luca would
not allow it. Luca was the eldest and wanted to take it himself.
Astorre was in tears. "_Cristo amore!_" he blubbered, "you will spill
the milk between you. I thought of it all by myself. Let go, Biagio; let
go, Luca!" So they whispered and tussled, pulling three different ways.

The Lady's voice broke over them like silver rain. "Let him who thought
of the kind act give me the milk," she said; so young Astorre on
his knees handed her the horn cup, and through the cracks of his
fingers watched her drink every drop.

That done, the cup returned with a smile piercingly sweet, the Lady rose.
Saints on thrones, how tall she was! "The _bimbo_ will thank
you for this to-morrow, as I do now," said she. "Goodnight, my friends,
and may the good God have mercy upon all souls!" She turned to go the
way she had come, but Astorre, covering his eyes with one hand,
crept forward on three legs (as you might say) and plucked the hem
of her robe up, and kissed it. She stooped to lay a hand upon his head.
"Never kiss my robe, Astorre," said she--and how under Heaven did
she know his name if she were not _what she was_?

--"never kiss my robe, but get up and let me kiss you." Well of Truth!
to think of it! Up gets Astorre, shaking like a nun in a fit, and the
Lady bent over him and, as sure as you are you, kissed his
forehead. Astorre told his village next day as they sat round him in
a ring, and he on the wellhead as plain to be seen as this paper, that
he felt at that moment as if two rose-leaves had dropped from heaven
upon his forehead. Slowly then, very slowly and smoothly (as they
report), did the Lady move away towards the peach-trees whence she
had come.

In the half light there was--for by this it was the hour before dawn--they
saw her take a peach from one of the trees. She stayed to eat it.
Then she walked over the crest of the orchard and disappeared.
As soon as they dared, when the light had come, they looked for her
over that same crest, but could see nothing whatever. With pale, serious
faces the three youths regarded each other.
There was no doubt as to what had happened--a miracle! a miracle!

With one consent then--since this was plainly a Church affair--they
ran to their parish priest, Don Gasparo.

He got the whole story at last; nothing could shake them; no detail
was wanting.

Thus it was: the Blessed Virgin, carrying in her arms the Santissimo
Bambino Gesù, had come through the peach-trees, asked for and eaten of
their food, prayed for them aloud to Messer Domeneddio himself, and kissed
Astorre on the forehead. As they were on their knees, she walked away,
stopped, took a peach, ate it, walked on, vanished--_ecco_! The curate
rubbed his head, and tried another boy. Useless: the story was the same.
Third boy, same story. He tucked up his cassock with decision, took
his biretta and walking-staff, and said to the three goat-herds:--
"My lads, all this is matter of miracle. I do not deny its truth--God
forbid it in a simple man such as I am. But I do certainly ask you to
lead me to the scene of your labours."
The boys needed no second asking: off they all set. The curate went
over every inch of the ground. Here lay Luca, Biagio, and Astorre;
the belfry of San Zeno was in such and such a direction, the
peach-trees in such and such. Good: there they were. What next?
According to their account, Madonna had come thus and thus. The good
curate bundled off to spy for footprints in the orchard. Marvel! there
were none. This made him look very grave; for if she made no earthly
footprints, she could have no earthly feet. Next he must see by what way
she had gone. She left them kneeling here, said they, went
towards the peach-garden, stayed by a certain tree (which they pointed
out), plucked a peach from the very top of it--this they swore to,
though the tree was near fourteen feet high--stood while she ate it, and
went over the brow of the rising ground. Here was detail enough, it
is to be hoped. The curate nosed it out like a slot-hound; he paced
the track himself from the scrub to the peach-tree, and stood under this
last gazing to its top, from there to its roots; he shook his head
many times, stroked his chin a few: then with a broken cry he made a
pounce and picked up--a peach-stone! After this to doubt would have
been childish; as a fact he had no more than the boys.

"My children," said he, "we are here face to face with a great
mystery.
It is plain that Messer Domeneddio hath designs upon this hamlet, of which
we, His worms, have no conception. You, my dear sons, He hath chosen
to be workers for His purpose, which we cannot be very far wrong in
supposing to be the building of an oratory or tabernacle to hold this
unspeakable relic. That erection must be our immediate, anxious
care.

Meantime I will place the relic in the pyx of our Lady's altar, and
mark the day in our calendar for perpetual remembrance. I shall not
fail to communicate with his holiness the bishop. Who knows what may
be the end of this?"
He was as good as his word. A procession was formed in no time--children
carrying their rosaries and bunches of flowers, three banners, the
whole village with a candle apiece; next Luca, Biagio, and Astorre
with larger candles--half a pound weight each at the least; then
four men to hold up a canopy, below which came the good curate
himself with the relic on a cushion.

It was deposited with great reverence in the place devoted, having been
drenched with incense. There was a solemn mass. After which things the
curate thought himself at liberty to ruffle into Verona with his
news.

VI
THE VISITATION OF THE GOLDEN FISH

When a beast of chase--hart-royal, bear, or wolf--has been bayed and broken
up, the least worthy parts are thrown to the curs which always come
in at the heels of the pack. So it is with a kingly seat: the best
of the meats, after the great officers of the household have feasted,
go to the dependants of these; the peelings and guttings, the scum
and scour of the broth, are flung farther, to the parasites of the
parasites, the ticks on ticks' backs. Round about the Castle of
Verona, where Can Grande II. misused the justice which his forefathers
had set up, lay the houses of his courtiers; beyond them the lodgings
of the grooms; beyond them again, down to the river's brink, were
the stews and cabins and unholy dens, whose office was to be lower
than the lowest, that there might still be degrees for the gentlemen
of gentlemen's gentlemen. And since even cockroaches must drink,
in this fungus-bed of misery there flourished a rather infamous
tavern by the sale of _vino nostrano_, black and sour, of certain
sausages, black also and nameless, speckled with white lumps, and
of other wares whom to name were to expose. This was the tavern of
the Golden Fish.
On the evening of the day of the Translation of the Peach-stone,
this tavern was full to suffocation. Stefano, the purple-faced host,
in shirt and breeches, stood dealing the liquor from a tub. Two
outlaws lay under the benches, partly for fear of a visit from the
watch, partly because, having already fallen there once, they feared
to fall there again if they rose. In one hand each held his knife,
in the other his empty mug.
Two ladies, intimates of theirs, Robaccia and Crucciacorda, sat
immediately above them, with petticoats ready to make ambush the
moment a staff should rattle at the door; round the table half a
dozen shabby rogues bickered over their cards; Picagente, the hairy
brigand, lay snoring across the threshold, and his dog on him; on
a barrel in a corner a gigantic shepherd in leather, with bandaged
legs and a patch over one eye, shut the other eye while he roared
a hymn to Bacchus at the top stretch of his lungs. The oil-lamp
flickered, flared, and gloomed, half drowned in the fumes of wine.
A smell of wicked bodies, foul clothes, drink, and bad language
made the air well-nigh solid. The hour was at the stroke of ten;
outside the streets seemed asleep.
In the middle of the uproar Stefano the host looked up sharply,
listening.
"Stop your devil's ferment, Malabocca!" he thundered at the shepherd;
"stop it, or I'll split your crown."
"Bacco trionfante, Amante e spumante, Evviva l'ubbriacchezza!"
roared Malabocca, screwing up his eye.
Stefano brought down a mug full of wine upon his pate, which gave
him a red baptism.
"Mum, you blockhead, mum!" said his host "There is a stir outside
the door I tell you!" 
The shepherd grew sober in a moment.
There was a brief scramble in the room--then silence.Then the high schools were opened to girls, and thousands were able to
get a fair education whose mothers had had no opportunities whatever.
And then about thirty years ago, colleges for women sprang up, and the
young women of our day have the same advantages as the young men.

Mothers must always, of course, expect to be outstripped in some
directions by their daughters. Indeed, they wish to have it so, for they
wish to have their daughters stand on as high ground as possible; but
when the process goes on as rapidly as it has done through the wonderful
opening of the means of education in the last half century, it has a
painful side. Especially is it so in this country, where there is such a
spirit of equality that in spite of all the barriers of caste, the
daughter of a wholly unrefined mother may occupy a high position. In
England a clever daughter may have a stupid mother, but a refined
daughter is not very likely to have a mother who is outwardly coarse,
because class lines have been drawn so distinctly for many generations
that mother and daughter have essentially the same kind of education and
see essentially the same kind of people. In America this is the
exception instead of the rule, though now that the highest education is
open to all women, the chances are that the contrasts will be less sharp
in future.

But at present the gulf between mother and daughter is often so wide
that it requires more than tact to bridge it. A sense of duty will keep
a daughter outwardly kind and respectful to her mother, but love is the
mother's only real security; and a mother must be thoroughly good at
heart and refined in feeling to hold the warm love of a daughter whose
intellectual tastes and social standards she outrages every moment. On
the other hand, if the daughter's education has not taught her that
character is more than intellect, it is worse than useless.

"Intellect separates," said Dr. James Freeman Clarke, "but love unites."
Here lies the key to this problem.


I have said little of marriage, for the subject is difficult. A
thoroughly high-minded woman will not be likely to marry unworthily, and
she may be trusted to meet the problems that rise after marriage in a
worthy manner. The special difficulties in each pathway will depend on
temperament and circumstances, and no general rules can be laid down for
meeting them.

I hold to the old-fashioned doctrine that a true marriage opens the way
to the best and happiest life for both men and women. Anything less than
a true marriage is intolerable and debasing.

But girls can hardly choose whether they will be married or not. They
can say No to all offers, and some women do plan for opportunities to
say Yes, yet most of us feel that there are few circumstances in which
a girl of noble instincts could take the initiative.

Can parents do anything? The Parachute commonly in use is nothing more
or less than a huge Umbrella, presenting a surface of sufficient dimension
to experience from the air a resistance equal to the weight of descent,
in moving through the fluid at a velocity not exceeding that of the shock
which a person can sustain without danger or injury. It is made of silk
or cotton. To the outer edge cords are fastened, of about the same length
as the diameter of the machine (24 to 28 feet).

A centre cord is attached to the apex and meets the cords from the
margin, acting, in fact, as the stick of the Umbrella. The machine is
thus kept expanded during descent. The car is fastened to
the centre cord, and the whole attached to the balloon in such a manner
that it may be readily and quickly detached, either by cutting a string,
or pulling a trigger. Consequently, in the East, where the Umbrella has
been from the earliest ages in familiar use, it appears to have been
occasionally employed by vaulters, to enable them to jump safely from
great heights. Father Loubère, in his curious account of Siam, relates,
that a person famous in that country for his dexterity, used to divert
the King and Court by the extraordinary leaps he took, having two Umbrellas
with long slender handles, fastened to his girdle. In 1783 M. le Normand
demonstrated the utility of the Parachute; by lifting himself down
from the windows of a high house at Lyons. His idea was that it might
be made a sort of fire-escape.

Blanchard was the first person who constructed a Parachute to act
as a safety-guard to the aeronaut in case of any accident.

During an excursion he made from Lille, in 1785, when he traversed, without
stopping, a distance of 300 miles, he let down a Parachute with a basket
fastened to it containing a dog.
Intelligent men like intelligent wives, and value a certain brightness
of mind; but it must be admitted that few men care to marry intellectual
women unless such women have the tact to keep their gifts somewhat in
the background. (I may here say,--it is not worth more than a
parenthesis--that the infallible rule for securing some kind of a
husband is to be able to flatter a man, either by a real or pretended
interest in him, or a real or pretended admiration of his powers. But I
hope I have no reader who would wish for marriage on such terms, so I
will not catalogue any attractions which ought not to win.) You remember

Horace Mann and Miss Elizabeth Peabody were both nearly eighty when
they went to Washington on official business--something in reference to
the Indian troubles, I believe. I have already cited my mother's friend
who began to study botany at ninety. And why not? If the end of
knowledge was to help us to get our daily bread, we might at last fold
our hands; but if it is to open our minds to the glory of the universe,
to make us more worthy to be the immortal souls we hope we are, why
should we not be just as eager to learn at ninety as at nine?

A sensitive woman is sure to have many and many an experience in life
which will make her heart sad and sore; but I think that every brave and
good woman will also feel more and more, as time goes on, that the
kingdom of heaven is within her.

  By text-book we do not mean a formal school-book, but a book
with a clear method, a capital style, and adequate information. They
had glorious success, even in cold New England, and of the fruit of
the revivals which attended their labors formed many small but
excellent "societies." One of these was established in Pittsfield.

The sweet and moving singing of these people arrested the attention
of our heroine and her friends as they occasionally rode by; and,
pausing in their saddles to listen, enough of a tune would get into
their heads and keep ringing there to turn their course that way
again.

The
hints to observers with which it opens, the appendix giving the
classification of birds by general family characteristics, by
localities, by colors, by song, the books of reference, and the index,
all combine to make the book extremely useful.--_The Academy_
