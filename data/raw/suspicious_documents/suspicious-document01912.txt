"That's so!" said Billy. "I will!"

She was cheated of her innocent dream.

And by an awful irony her religion failed her. She knew its bitterness,
its terrors, its exactions. She never knew its ecstasies, its flaming
mysteries, nor, even at her very last, its consolations.

Her tender conscience drew an unspeakable torment from the spectacle
of her brother's degradation.

For it was on Anne, who had no genius to sustain her, that poor Branwell,
with the burden of his destiny, weighed most hard. It was Anne at
Thorp Green who had the first terrible misgivings, the intolerable
premonitions.

That wretched story is always cropping up again.

The lady whom Mrs.

Gaskell, with a murderous selection of adjectives, called "that mature
and wicked woman", has been cleared as far as evidence and common sense
could clear her. But the slander is perpetually revived. It has always
proved too much for the Brontë biographers.

Madame Duclaux published it again twenty years after, in spite of
the evidence and in spite of Mrs.

Gaskell's retractation. You would have thought that Branwell
might have been allowed to rest in the grave he dug for himself so well.
But no, they will not let him rest. Branwell drank, and he ate opium;
and, as if drink and opium and erotic madness were not enough,
they must credit him with an open breach of the seventh commandment
as well.

M. Dimnet, the most able of recent critics of the Brontës, thinks and
maintains against all evidence that there was more in it than Branwell's
madness.
He will not give up the sordid tragedy _à trois_. He thinks he knows
what Anne thought of Branwell's behaviour, and what awful secret
she was hinting at, and what she told her sisters when she came
back to Haworth.

He argues that Anne Brontë saw and heard things, and that her testimony
is not to be set aside.

What did Anne Brontë see and hear? She saw her brother consumed by an
illegitimate passion; a passion utterly hopeless, given the nature of
the lady.

The lady had been kind to Anne, to Branwell she had been angelically
kind. Anne saw that his behaviour was an atrocious return for her kindness.
Further than that the lady hardly counted in Anne's vision.

Her interest was centred on her brother. She saw him taking first to
drink and then to opium.

She saw that he was going mad, and he did go mad. One of the most familiar
symptoms of morphia mania is a tendency to erotic hallucinations
of the precise kind that Branwell suffered from.

Anne was unable to distinguish between such a hallucination and
depravity. But there is not a shadow of evidence that she thought what
M. Dimnet thinks, or that if she had thought it she made Charlotte and
Emily think it too.

Branwell's state was quite enough in itself to break their hearts.

His letters to Leyland, to John Brown, the sexton, to Francis Grundy,
record with frightful vividness every phase of his obsession.

It is inconceivable that such letters should have been kept, still
more inconceivable that they should have been published.

It is inconceivable that Mrs. Gaskell should have dragged the pitiful and
shameful figure into the light.

Nobody can save poor Branwell now from the dreadful immortality
thrust on him by his enemies and friends with equal zeal.

All that is left to us is a merciful understanding of his case.

Branwell's case, once for all, was purely pathological. There was nothing
great about him, not even his passion for Mrs.

Robinson.

Properly speaking, it was not a passion at all, it was a disease.
"Many days and many nights, all through the cold winter. The wind rocked
