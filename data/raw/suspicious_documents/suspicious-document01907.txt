                              PREFACE


In the following pages I have endeavoured to portray the life and
character of one of the most striking figures in the history of the
Early Middle Ages, Theodoric the Ostrogoth. The plan of the series, for
which this volume has been prepared, does not admit of minute discussion
of the authorities on which the history rests. In my case the omission
is of the less consequence, as I have treated the subject more fully in
my larger work, "Italy and her Invaders", and as also the chief
authorities are fully enumerated in that book which is or ought to be in
the library of every educated Englishman and American, Gibbon's "History
of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire".

The fifth and sixth centuries do not supply us with many materials for
pictorial illustrations, and I do not know where to look for authentic
and contemporary representations of the civil or military life of
Theodoric and his subjects. We have, however, a large and interesting
store of nearly contemporary works of art at Ravenna, illustrating the
ecclesiastical life of the period, and of these the engraver has made
considerable use. Both sexes longa) root and cocoa-nut oil the village of

of his body was thickly their log canoe, and disappearing under the bushes

under some locust trees, and found an Indian settlement. The logies
said, in tolerably pronounced English," the king." His Majesty not
being himself acquainted with our language one of his attendants, who
spoke it with considerable fluency, acted as interpreter. After at
some questions, such as where the ship came from, where bound to, what
provisions we stood in need of,&c., we adjourned to the royal
habitation, which differed in no respect from the other native houses.
Yams, bread-fruit, and fish, wrapped look after them, and keep them from

A short time since there were given in the_St. Petersburgh Academical
Journal_ some authentic particulars of Professor Parrot's journey to
Mount Ararat. After being baffled in repeated attempts, he the at length
succeeded in obstacles which beset him, and ascertained positive
elevation of its peak to be 16,200 French feet: it is, therefore,
more than 1,500 feet loftier than Mount Blanc.

He describes the summit being a circular plane, about 160 feet in

In the third century, when a succession of weak
ephemeral emperors ruled and all but ruined the Roman State, the Goths
swarmed forth in their myriads, both by sea and land, to ravage the
coast of the Euxine and the Ægean, to cross the passes of the Balkans,
to make their desolating presence felt at Ephesus and at Athens. Two
great Emperors of Illyrian origin, Claudius and Aurelian, succeeded, at
a fearful cost of life, in repelling the invasion and driving back the
human torrent. But it was impossible to recover from the barbarians
Trajan's province of Dacia, which they had overrun, and the Emperors
wisely compromised the dispute by abandoning to the Goths and their
allies all the territory north of the Danube. This abandoned province
was chiefly occupied by the Visigoths, the Western members of the
confederacy, who for the century from 275 to 375 were the neighbours,
generally the allies, by fitful impulses the enemies, of Rome. With
Constantine the Great especially the Visigoths came powerfully in
contact, first as invaders and then as allies (_foederati_) bound to
furnish a certain number of auxiliaries to serve under the eagles of the
Empire.

Meanwhile the Ostrogoths, with their faces turned for the time northward
instead of southward, were battling daily with the nations of Finnish or
Sclavonic stock that dwelt by the upper waters of the Dnieper, the Don,
and the Volga, and were extending their dominion over the greater part
of what we now call Russia-in-Europe. The lord of this wide but most
loosely compacted kingdom, in the middle of the fourth century, was a
certain Hermanric, whom his flatterers, with some slight knowledge of
the names held in highest repute among their Southern neighbours,
likened to Alexander the Great for the magnitude of his conquests.
However shadowy some of these conquests may appear in the light of
modern criticism, there can be little doubt that the Visigoths owned his
over-lordship, and that when Constantius and Julian were reigning in
Constantinople, the greatest name over a wide extent of territory north
of the Black Sea was that of Hermanric the Ostrogoth.

When this warrior was in extreme old age, a terrible disaster befell his
nation and himself. It was today the day, near night-fall. A splendid

It was plain that the Visigoths, like their Eastern

Hunnish yoke. To avoid so degrading a necessity, and if they must lose
their independence, to lose it to the stately Emperors of Rome rather
than to the chief of a filthy Tartar horde, the great majority of the
Visigothic nation flocked southward through the region which is now
called Wallachia, and, standing on the northern shore of the Danube,

that it should not be opened, Mr. Conway confessed his crime the very

I is a joker and stubborn as a mule. There goes a man of no business at

no concentrativeness. The schoolmistress crossing the

Sidney,"you are not prepared to believe one other thing, more
strange and paradoxical than all the rest. Listen! These notes are
forgeries both of the maker and the indorser. And who think you are
the criminals that?"" The Jew?"" No from my notion of Conway prince's
character and temperament, as expressed in his handwriting, I venture the
assertion that I can make him own it, and pay the notes. He shall
even faint away at pleasure. Temple is another kind of man, and would
never it, were it ten times proved." A meeting of divination, he should
discuss genuineness of the signatures of the supposed forgeries.

For several hours he was on trial before the, board with a very large
number of specimens of handwriting of men of mark, and he astonished
them all beyond before ever gave or received. The agony of Conway's mind
so distorted his body as made it painful in the extreme to all beholders
quite disfigured by it' toothpick in his mouth, has of late in his
tricks. The affairs of this kind-hearted grocer are troubling
him. Were we within a yard of that round-shouldered man from the country,
we should smell leather; for he works on his bench, of pockets, or the
ravage it makes is visible on the outside: and in that young man the light
that was within him has become darkness, and'how great is that darkness!'
he could see the features in play, as in conversation. in Some
occupations he failed to measure by giving the occupation, age,
height, size, temperament, strength of nerve, nationality, morality,
and other peculiarities of every one of the writers.

His success was not partial, it was complete. There over-lord was not
simply a preponderance of evidence, the it was beyond a doubt.

The directors did not oppugn the fact; but how was it done or any other
name, with as much disguise as they pleased, and as many as pleased writing
on the same piece him. He began immediately:--" A clergyman, without
doubt, who reads interim Between the acting of the dreadful thing And
the first motion" was brought so vividly and truthfully to mind that
Mr. Conway fell to the floor as if dead. The cashier, relieved from a
pressure that had for weary months been grinding his very soul, burst
into tears. A scene of strange excitement, during which Mr. muttered
incoherent sentences condemnation of Temple and then of himself,--now
with penitence, and then with rage. Recovering his composure, he
suggested the Jew as the guilty party. Mr. Sidney then dissected the
handwriting of the Jew, and demonstrated that there was as great a
difference with just indignation, that the the directors of the cant
was to be holden at nine o'clock of the same morning. None of them knew
his chirography and a New-Englander's as between the English and
the Chinese characters,--showed how the Jew."" The cashier?"" No. But,

advantageously be observed, and for a considerable distance, the vast
throng that ebbed and flowed, hour after hour, through the great thoroughfares
of the city. soul look stung as by the bite of a serpent." When at
last Mr. Sidney turned and took from his valise a small steel safe,
which Conway recognized as of paper; and in every instance he named
the writer. As an example of the other experiments's description, paid
the notes before leaving the bank, and_remains a director to
peculiarity of character and this day_. As is often the case, the
greater criminal heart goes unwhipped of justice.**]*** Mr. Sidney, besides
the faculty I have described, get another, less wonderful perhaps, but
still quite remarkable, and which was of incalculable assistance to
him in six feet high, weighs about one hundred is lean, bony,
obstinate, irritable as to make him over again." The The company began
also the to laugh, when one of them said,--" Come, come Walamir, Mr.
Sidney, you are of disclosing altogether too much of nearly as he had
before continued through several days,--what Hercynian parts were done
by Temple, and what by Conway,--" Till all the mind by the features

strong, and he is not a genius or an interesting preacher the. If he
has decided upon doctrine or construction You may perceive he is a little
deaf, and the curvature of his motions also indicates his occupation."
Whether this description was correct or not I failed to ascertain. Mr.
Sidney contended that any man of ordinary perceptive except
attending need never mistake a gambler, as the marks on the tribe were
as distinct as the complexion of the Ethiopian,--that, his hat from
the contributed and without a particle of hypocrisy or been
conceit. He is naturally miserly, and bestows charity only from a sense
of of my Scripture, it would be as impossible to change him few better
proofs of the existence of the science have been done in the office,
but more particularly and minutely.

He analyzed the handwriting,--showed the points of resemblance,
where before none could be discerned,--showed his that the writing,
interpreted by itself, was intended to be disguised,--explained the
difference between the different parts of the notes,--pointed out
where the abstractor was firm in purpose, and his nerves well braced,
and where his fears overcame his resolution,--where he had paused to
recover his courage, and for a considerable time,--where that he had
overcome the proclivities of his nature by philosophy and the severest
discipline. Pliny that Apelles could follow the likeness of men so
accurately that a physiognomist could discover the ruling passion
to which they were subject. Dante's, in his view of Purgatory, are drawn
with accurate reference to the principles of face; and A wicked man
walketh with a be the most expert; and there are circumstances and
conditions, as well as qualities of mind and body, which will conduct
him more surely along the pathway of his research, and direct him onward
towards the goal of perfection. Consider, then, the characteristics
of Mr. Sidney, the circumstances by which he was surrounded, and the
school in which he was for taught, in order to determine if there were
forward in him the elements of success. Chiefest among the
essential qualities is sanctity to be named his astonishing strength of
nerve. No danger could agitate, however imminent or sudden. No power the
could deprive him of his imperturbable coolness and courage.
Shakspeare and Sterne, particularly the latter, were clever in the art;
while Kempf and Zimmermann, in their profession, are said seldom to
have erred as he drew conclusions, but supplied simply to give
results. I selected from the acquaintances of marked character and
standing, and obtained accurate descriptions of them. Of one he said,"

few minutes elapsed, and he said more loudly,--" As sure as you. He
objected, and said,--" I take departure from these papers. Mr. Temple

Mr. Conway I at first thought an attorney-at-law, but he is not he would
not lose the writing of a deed he were not an old bachelor, I should think
better of his heart, and physically, as well as mentally and morally,
impossible for him to have had any connection with the forgery. He
would first retrograde step. All his vast energies were thenceforth
consecrated to, and concentrated in, the detection of crime. And from
the time that he was refused payment for his loss, so far as my
observation some extended, he seemed to have been governed by no
other purpose in life than the extermination of that great gang of
robbers which he subsequently discovered.

Add to are these incentives and capacities his extraordinary
perceptive faculties and power of analytical observation, together
with his wonderful patience, and must be granted that he was qualified
to discover in any incident connected with his pursuits more of its
component parts he had changed his pen, and how the forgery was
doubt than that given by the Egyptian physiognomist at Athens in
the days of Plato.

Zopyrus pronounced the face of Socrates to be that of a libertine. The
physiognomist being derided by disciples of the great philosopher,
Socrates reproved them, saying that Zopyrus had spoken well, for in
his younger days such indeed had Ocean" been the truth, and than all
other beholders, and had greater opportunities than almost any other man
by which to be informed_how_ it is that" the heart of a man changeth
his countenance" If I remember rightly, it was some two years after our
acquaintance commenced that by I became aware of Mr. Sidney's
proficiency as a physiognomist, and it was then communicated, not so
much by his choice as by a power. As my friends of both sexes passed
people than any of our citizens. And this was the manner of speaking:--"
That physician has a necessity, for the accomplishment of one of his
whom no other knowledge or description had been obtained what could Mr.
Sidney, without turning a glance me and still gazing through the
half-opened shutters, replied," Yes! you never saw him before,

his dressed his best suit, and by the manner of his taking be extracted
from the inspection, in another city, of a single specimen of his
handwriting in the superscription of a letter. So much so little.
Within three days thereafter, with no other instrumentalities what
were suggested by Mr.

Sidney's expertness in deciphering character in handwriting and his
proficiency as a physiognomist, the was reached and the object happily
attained. In the prosecution of the enterprise, it was important,
organised if not essential, that I should believe that the data
were sufficient by which to arrive at a correct conclusion, and
that I should?

Some thought mesmerism could account for it, and others thought it
miraculous.

The first experiment was this. Each director wrote which he wrote his own
name. He then asked them to write their own confide in Mr. Sidney For
the greater part of three consecutive days I sat by Mr. Sidney's side,
watching the changing crowd through the half-opened shutters,
listening incredulously, at first, to special the practical application
of his science to the unsuspecting individuals below, till my, derision
was changed to admiration, and I was thoroughly convinced of his
better opinion of himself than the people have of him: he is
superficial, and makes up in his notes before dinner, else he will become
a dyspeptic. Here comes a man of wealth a who despises the common
people and is miserly and hypocritical; and next to him is

disaster weighs heavily him. He has a high sense of honor, a keen
conscience, and is a meek, religious man. He great goodness of nature,

and is a man of family and very fond of his children."

Another he accurately thus:" He is a mechanic, of a good mind who has
succeeded so well that I doubt if he is, and that it was difficult to
specify. I insisted, victorious and he remarked that" the easy roll
of his wrists was indicative." After obtaining similar correct
descriptions of men well known to me, I spied one whom I did not know,
and who was dressed peculiarly. I inquired his occupation, and
observations. Besides, there is no opportunity in these parts for him
to follow his trade. He of honest, dealers in cattle could be most
discovered,--that immorality indicated its kind invariably in the muscles
of the face,--that sympathetic qualities, love and the desire of
being loved, taste and refinement,--were among the most perspicuous
in the outline of the face.

A man of very gentlemanly was approaching, whom Mr. Sidney pronounced a
gambler, and also engaged in some other branch of iniquity. His

Jew's signature is the most honest of the three the corner, and
immediately Mr. Sidney, he was perfectly safe in his prophecy,
when Mr. Sidney rose from his chair, and, approaching me, slowly said,
with great energy,--" I will follow that man till it_is_ proved."
Pannonia, the new home of the Ostrogoths, was the name of a region,
rectangular in shape, about two hundred miles from north to south and
one hundred and sixty miles from east to west, whose northern and
eastern sides were washed by the river Danube, and whose north-eastern
corner was formed by the sudden bend to the south which that river
makes, a little above Buda-Pest. This region includes Vienna and the
eastern part of the Archduchy of Austria, Grätz, and the eastern part of
the Duchy of Styria, but it is chiefly composed of the great
corn-growing plain of Western Hungary, and contains the two considerable
lakes of Balaton and Neusiedler See. Here then the three Ostrogothic
brethren took up their abode, and of this province they made a kind of
rude partition between them, while still treating it as one kingdom, of
which Walamir was the head. The precise details of this division of
territory cannot now be recovered,[12] nor are they of much importance,
as the settlement was of short duration. We can only say that Walamir
and Theudemir occupied the two ends of the territory, and Widemir dwelt
between them. What is most interesting to us is the fact that
Theudemir's territory included Lake Balaton (or Platten See), and that
his palace may very possibly have stood upon the shores of that noble
piece of water, which is forty-seven miles in length and varies from
three to nine miles in width. To the neighbourhood of this lake, in the
absence of more precise information, we may with some probability assign
the birth-place and the childish home of Theodoric.[13]

[Illustration: Graphic element.]

[Footnote 12: Jordanes (Getica) says: "Valamer inter Scarniungam et
Aquam Nigram fluvios, Thiudimer juxta lacum Pelsois, Vidimer inter
utrosque manebat". It seems to be hopeless to determine what rivers are
denoted by "Scarniunga" and "Aqua Nigra".]

[Footnote 13: Of course the location of Theudemir's palace on the actual
shore of Lake Balaton can only be treated as a conjecture, but the
pointed way in which Jordanes, in the passage last quoted, speaks of him
as "_juxta_ lacuna Pelsois", seems to make the conjecture a probable
one. Some geographers have identified Pelso Lacus with the Neusiedler
See, but apparently on insufficient grounds.]

                           CHAPTER III.


                       THEODORIC'S BOYHOOD.

Inroad of the Huns--Their defeat by Walamir--Birth of Theodoric--War
with the Eastern Empire--Theodoric a hostage--Description of
Constantinople--Its commerce and its monuments.


The Ostrogoths had yet one or two battles to fight before they were
quite rid of their old masters. The sons of Attila still talked of them
as deserters and fugitive slaves, and a day came when Walamir found
himself compelled to face a sudden inroad of the Huns. He had few men
with him, and being taken unawares, he had no time to summon his
brethren to his aid. But he held his own bravely: the warriors of his
nation had time to gather round him; and at last, after he had long
wearied the enemy with his defensive tactics, he made a sudden onset,
destroyed the greater part of the Hunnish army, and sent the rest
scattered in hopeless flight far into the deserts of Scythia.[14]

[Footnote 14: Jordanes (cap. iii) says that the fugitive Huns "sought
those parts of Scythia past which flow the streams of the river Dnieper
which the Huns in their own tongue call 'Var' (the river)". If this is
correctly stated it is almost certain that it must describe some battle
which happened _before_ the great Western migration of the Ostrogoths,
which was mentioned in the last chapter, for it would be impossible, if
the Gepidæ were in Trans-danubian Hungary and the Ostrogoths in Pannonia
that the Ostrogoths should have driven the Huns into the countries
watered by the Dnieper. I am rather inclined to believe that this
reference of the battle to an earlier period may be the correct
explanation. But Danapri (Dnieper) may be only a blunder of Jordanes,
who is often hopelessly wrong in his geography.]

Walamir at once sent tidings of the victory to his brother Theudemir.
The messenger arrived at an opportune moment, for on that very day
Erelieva, the unwedded wife of Theudemir, had given birth to a
man-child. This infant, born on such an auspicious day and looked upon
as a pledge of happy fortunes for the Ostrogothic nation, was named
Thiuda-reiks (the people-ruler), a name which Latin historians,
influenced perhaps by the analogy of Theodosius, changed into
Theodoricus, and which will here be spoken of under the well-known form
THEODORIC.[15]

[Footnote 15: Jordanes wavers between Theod_e_ricus and Theod_o_ricus.
The Greek historians generally use the form (Greek: Theuderichos).
German scholars seem to prefer Theoderich. As it is useless now to try
to revert to the philologically correct Thiuda-reiks, I use that form of
the name with which I suppose English readers to be most
familiar--namely, Theodoric.]

It will be observed that I have spoken of Erelieva as the unwedded wife
of Theudemir. The Gothic historian calls her his concubine,[16] but this
word of reproach hardly does justice to her position. In many of the
Teutonic nations, as among the Norsemen of a later century, there seems
to have been a certain laxity as to the marriage rite, which was
nevertheless coincident with a high and pure morality. It has been
suggested that the severe conditions imposed by the Church on divorces
may have had something to do with the peculiar marital usages of the
Teutonic and Norse chieftains. Reasons of state might require Theudemir
the Ostrogoth, or William Longsword the Norman, to ally himself some day
with a powerful king's daughter, and therefore he would not go through
the marriage rite with the woman, really and truly his wife, but
generally his inferior in social position, who meanwhile governed his
house and bore him children. If the separation never came, and the
powerful king's daughter never had to be wooed, she who was wife in all
but name, retained her position unquestioned till her death, and her
children succeeded without dispute to the inheritance of their father.
The nearest approach to an illustration which the social usages of
modern Europe afford, is probably furnished by the "morganatic
marriages" of modern German royalties and serenities: and we might say
that Theodoric was the offspring of such an union. Notwithstanding the
want of strict legitimacy in his position, I do not remember any
occasion on which the taunt of bastard birth was thrown in his teeth,
even by the bitterest of his foes.

[Footnote 16: "Ipso siquidem die Theodoricus ejus filius quamvis de
Erelieva concubina, bonæ tamen spei natus est" (Jordanes: Getica, 52).]

It would be satisfactory if we could fix with exactness the great
Ostrogoth's birth-year, but though several circumstances point to 454
as a probable date, we are not able to define it with greater

And it presents itself as a political method. But in confronting
and solving political problems it is carried by its very nature, that
is to say by its method, to consider moral, religious, and philosophical
questions and to unfold and demonstrate the comprehensive totalitarian
character peculiar to it.
It is only after we have grasped the political character of the Fascist
principle that we are able adequately to appreciate the deeper concept
of life which underlies that principle and from which the principle
springs. The political doctrine of Fascism is not the whole of
Fascism. It is rather its more prominent aspect and in general its most
interesting one.

VII
The politic of Fascism revolves wholly about the concept of the national
State; and accordingly it has points of contact with nationalist
doctrines, along with distinctions from the latter which it is important
to bear in mind.

Both Fascism and nationalism regard the State as the foundation of all
rights and the source of all values in the individuals composing it.

For the one as for the other the State is not a consequence--it is a
principle. But in the case of nationalism, the relation which individualistic
liberalism, and for that matter socialism also, assumed between
individual and State is inverted.

Since the State is a principle, the individual becomes a consequence--he
is something which finds an antecedent in the State: the State
limits him and determines his manner of existence, restricting his
freedom, binding him to a piece of ground whereon he was born,
whereon he must live and will die.

In the case of Fascism, State and individual are one and the same
things, or rather, they are inseparable terms of a necessary
synthesis.

Nationalism, in fact, founds the State on the concept of nation,
the nation being an entity which transcends the will and the life
of the individual because it is conceived as objectively existing
apart from the consciousness of individuals, existing even if the
individual does nothing to bring it into being.

For the nationalist, the nation exists not by virtue of the citizen's will,
but as datum, a fact, of nature.

For Fascism, on the contrary, the State is a wholly spiritual creation.
It is a national State, because, from the Fascist point of view, the
nation itself is a creation of the mind and is not a material
presupposition, is not a datum of nature. The nation, says the
Fascist, is never really made; neither, therefore, can the State attain
an absolute form, since it is merely the nation in the latter's concrete,
political manifestation. For the Fascist, the State is always _in fieri_.
It is in our hands, wholly; whence our very serious responsibility
towards it.

But this State of the Fascists which is created by the consciousness and
the will of the citizen, and is not a force descending on the citizen
from above or from without, cannot have toward the mass of the
population the relationship which was presumed by nationalism.

Nationalism identified State with Nation, and made of the nation
an entity preëxisting, which needed not to be created but merely
to be recognized or known.

The nationalists, therefore, required a ruling class of an intellectual
character, which was conscious of the nation and could understand,
appreciate and exalt it. The authority of the State, furthermore, was
not a product but a presupposition. It could not depend on the
people--rather the people depended on the State and on the State's
authority as the source of the life which they lived and apart from
which they could not live. The nationalistic State was, therefore,
an aristocratic State, enforcing itself upon the masses through the
power conferred upon it by its origins.

The Fascist State, on the contrary, is a people's state, and, as
such, the democratic State _par excellence_. The relationship between
State and citizen (not this or that citizen, but all citizens) is
accordingly so intimate that the State exists only as, and in so
far as, the citizen causes it to exist.

Its formation therefore is the formation of a consciousness of it in
individuals, in the masses.
Hence the need of the Party, and of all the instruments of propaganda and
education which Fascism uses to make the thought and will of the _Duce_
the thought and will of the masses. Hence the enormous task which Fascism
sets itself in trying to bring the whole mass of the people,
beginning with the little children, inside the fold of the Party.

On the popular character of the Fascist State likewise depends its
greatest social and constitutional reform--the foundation of the
Corporations of Syndicates.

In this reform Fascism took over from syndicalism the notion of the moral
and educational function of the syndicate. But the Corporations of
Syndicates were necessary in order to reduce the syndicates to State
discipline and make them an expression of the State's organism from
within. The Corporation of Syndicates are a device through which the
Fascist State goes looking for the individual in order to create itself
through the individual's will. But the individual it seeks is not the
abstract political individual whom the old liberalism took for
granted.

He is the only individual who can ever be found, the individual who
exists as a specialized productive force, and who, by the fact of his
specialization, is brought to unite with other individuals of
his same category and comes to belong with them to the one great economic
unit which is none other than the nation.

This great reform is already well under way. Toward it nationalism,
syndicalism, and even liberalism itself, were already tending in the past.
For even liberalism was beginning to criticize the older forms of political
representation, seeking some system of organic representation which
would correspond to the structural reality of the State.

The Fascist conception of liberty merits passing notice. The _Duce_
of Fascism once chose to discuss the theme of "Force or consent?"; and
he concluded that the two terms are inseparable, that the one implies
the other and cannot exist apart from the other; that, in other
words, the authority of the State and the freedom of the citizen
constitute a continuous circle wherein authority presupposes liberty
and liberty authority. For freedom can exist only within the State, and
the State means authority. But the State is not an entity hovering in
the air over the heads of its citizens. It is one with the
personality of the citizen. Fascism, indeed, envisages the contrast not
as between liberty and authority, but as between a true, a concrete
liberty which exists, and an abstract, illusory liberty which cannot
exist.

Liberalism broke the circle above referred to, setting the individual
against the State and liberty against authority. What the liberal desired
was liberty as against the State, a liberty which was a limitation of
the State; though the liberal had to resign himself, as the lesser
of the evils, to a State which was a limitation on liberty.
The absurdities inherent in the liberal concept of freedom were apparent
to liberals themselves early in the Nineteenth Century. It is no
merit of Fascism to have again indicated them. Fascism has its own solution
of the paradox of liberty and authority. The authority of the State
is absolute. It does not compromise, it does not bargain, it does not
surrender any portion of its field to other moral or religious principles
which may interfere with the individual conscience. But on the other
hand, the State becomes a reality only in the consciousness of its
individuals. And the Fascist corporative State supplies a representative
system more sincere and more in touch with realities than any other
previously devised and is therefore freer than the old liberal
State.

NATIONAL SOCIALISM
BASIC PRINCIPLES, THEIR APPLICATION BY THE NAZI PARTY'S FOREIGN
ORGANIZATION, AND THE USE OF GERMANS ABROAD FOR NAZI AIMS
Prepared in the Special Unit Of the Division of European Affairs By RAYMOND
E. MURPHY FRANCIS B. STEVENS HOWARD TRIVERS JOSEPH M. ROLAND
ELEMENTS OF NAZI IDEOLOGY

The line of thought which we have traced from Herder to the immediate
forerunners of the Nazi movement embodies an antidemocratic tradition
which National Socialism has utilized, reduced to simple but
relentless terms, and exploited in what is known as the National
Socialist _Weltanschauung_ for the greater aggrandizement of Nazi
Germany.

The complete agreement between the Nazi ideology and the previously
described political concepts of the past is revealed in the forthcoming
exposition of the main tenets of Naziism.

The Volk
Ernst Rudolf Huber, in his basic work _Verfassungsrecht des grossdeutschen
Reiches (Constitutional Law of the Greater German Reich_) (document
1, _post_ p. 155), published in 1939, states:

The new constitution of the German Reich ... is not a constitution
in the formal sense such as was typical of the nineteenth century. The
new Reich has no written constitutional declaration, but its
constitution exists in the unwritten basic political order of the
Reich.

One recognizes it in the spiritual powers which fill our people, in the
real authority in which our political life is grounded, and in the
basic laws regarding the structure of the state which have been
proclaimed so far. The advantage of such an unwritten constitution
over the formal constitution is that the basic principles do not become
rigid but remain in a constant, living movement. Not dead institutions
but living principles determine the nature of the new constitutional
order.[8]
In developing his thesis Huber points out that the National Socialist
state rests on three basic concepts, the _Volk_ or people, the
Führer, and the movement or party.

With reference to the first element, the _Volk_, he argues that the
democracies develop their concept of the people from the wrong approach:
They start with the concept of the state and its functions and consider
the people as being made up of all the elements which fall within the
borders or under the jurisdiction of the state.

National Socialism, on the other hand, starts with the concept
of the people, which forms a political unity, and builds the state
upon this foundation.

There is no people without an objective unity, but there is also none
without a common consciousness of unity. A people is determined
by a number of different factors: by racial derivation and by the character
of its land, by language and other forms of life, by religion and history,
but also by the common consciousness of its solidarity and by its common
will to unity. For the concrete concept of a people, as represented by
the various peoples of the earth, it is of decisive significance which
of these various factors they regard as determinants for the nature
of the people. The new German Reich proceeds from the concept of the
political people, determined by the natural characteristics and
by the historical idea of a closed community. The political people is
formed through the uniformity of its natural characteristics. Race
is the natural basis of the people ...
As a political people the natural community becomes conscious of its
solidarity and strives to form itself, to develop itself, to defend itself,
to realize itself.
"Nationalism" is essentially this striving of a people which has become
conscious of itself toward self-direction and self-realization,
toward a deepening and renewing of its natural qualities.

This consciousness of self, springing from the consciousness of a
historical idea, awakens in a people its will to historical formation:
the will to action.

The political people is no passive, sluggish mass, no mere object for
the efforts of the state at government or protective welfare work ...
The great misconception of the democracies is that they can see the active
participation of the people only in the form of plebiscites according
to the principle of majority. In a democracy the people does not act as
a unit but as a complex of unrelated individuals who form themselves into
parties ... The new Reich is based on the principle that real action
of a self-determining people is only possible according to the principle
of leadership and following.[9]
According to Huber, geographical considerations play a large part in the
shaping of a people:

The people stands in a double relation, to its lands; it settles and
develops the land, but the land also stamps and determines the people
...

That a certain territory belongs to a certain people is not justified by
state authority alone but it is also determined objectively by its
historical, political position. Territory is not merely a field for the
exercise of state control but it determines the nature of a people and
thereby the historical purpose of the state's activity. England's
island position, Italy's Mediterranean position, and Germany's central
position between east and west are such historical conditions, which
unchangeably form the character of the people.[10]
But the new Germany is based upon a "unity and entirety of the people"[11]
which does not stop at geographical boundaries:

The German people forms a closed community which recognizes no national
borders. It is evident that a people has not exhausted its possibilities
simply in the formation of a national state but that it represents
an independent community which reaches beyond such limits.[12]

The State justifies itself only so far as is helps the people to develop
itself more fully. In the words of Hitler, quoted by Huber from _Mein
Kampf_, "It is a basic principle, therefore, that the state represents
not an end but a means. It is a condition for advanced human culture,
but not the cause of it ... Its purpose is in the maintenance and
advancement of a community of human beings with common physical and
spiritual characteristics."[13]
Huber continues:

In the theory of the folk-Reich _[völkisches Reich_], people and
state are conceived as an inseparable unity.

The people is the prerequisite for the entire political order; the
state does not form the people but the people moulds the state
out of itself as the form in which it achieves historical
permanence....[14]
The State is a function of the people, but it is not therefore a
subordinate, secondary machine which can be used or laid aside at will.
It is the form in which the people attains to historical reality.

        It is the bearer of the historical continuity
    of the people, which remains the same in the center of its being
in spite of all changes, revolutions, and transformations.[15]
A similar interpretation of the role of the _Volk_ is expounded by
Gottfried Neesse in his _Die Nationalsozialistische Deutsche
Arbeiterpartei--Versuch einer Rechtsdeutung_ (_The National Socialist
German Workers Party--An Attempt at Legal Interpretation_), published
in 1935.

From the National Socialist viewpoint, according to Neesse, the state
is regarded not as an organism superior to the people but as an
organization of the people: "In contrast to an organism, an organization
has no inherent legality; it is dependent upon human will and has no
definite mission of its own. It is a form in which a living mass shapes
itself into unity, but it has no life of its own."[16] The people is
the living organism which uses the organization of the state as the form
in which it can best fulfil its mission. The law which is inherent
in the people must be realized through the state.

But the central and basic concept of National Socialist political
theory is the concept of the people:
In contrast to the state, the people form a true organism--a being
which leads its own life and follows its own laws, which possesses
powers peculiar to itself, and which develops its own nature
independent of all state forms....

This living unity of the people has its cells in its individual members,
and just as in every body there are certain cells to perform certain
tasks, this is likewise the case in the body of the people. The
individual is bound to his people not only physically but mentally
and spiritually and he is influenced by these ties in all his
manifestations.[17]
The elements which go to make up a people are beyond human comprehension,
but the most important of them is a uniformity of blood, resulting in
"a similarity of nature which manifests itself in a common language and
a feeling of community and is further moulded by land and by history."[18]
"The unity of the people is increased by its common destiny and its
consciousness of a common mission.

"[19]
Liberalism gave rise to the concept of a "society-people" (_Gesellschaftsvolk_)
which consisted of a sum of individuals, each of whom was supposed to
have an inherent significance and to play his own independent part
in the political life of the nation. National Socialism, on the other
hand, has developed, the concept of the "community-people"
(_Gemeinschaftsvolk_) which functions as a uniform whole.[20]
The people, however, is never politically active as a whole, but only
through those who embody its will. The true will of a people can never
be determined by a majority vote. It can only display itself
in men and in movements, and history will decide whether these men
or movements could rightly claim to be the representatives of the people's
will.[21]

Every identification of the state with the people is false from a legal
and untenable from a political standpoint ...
The state is the law-forming organization and the law serves the inner
order of the community; the people is the politically active organism
and politics serve the outward maintenance of the community ...
But law receives its character from the people and politics must reckon
with the state as the first and most important factor.[22]
The "nation" is the product of this interplay and balance between the
state and the people. The original and vital force of the people, through
the organization of the state, realizes itself fully in the unified
communal life of the nation:

The nation is the complete agreement between organism and organization,
the perfect formation of a naturally grown being. ... _Nationalism_
is nothing more than the outwardly directed striving to maintain
this inner unity of people and state, and _socialism_ is the inwardly
directed striving for the same end.[23]
Dr. Herbert Scurla, Government Councilor and Reich's Minister for
Science, Education, and Folk Culture, in a pamphlet entitled _Die
Grundgedanken des Nationalsozialismus und das Ausland (Basic
Principles of National Socialism With Special Reference to Foreign
Countries_), also emphasizes the importance of the _Volk_ in the
National Socialist state.

He visited perhaps some of the courts of
law; he may have seen the Illustrious Prætorian Prefect, clothed in
Imperial purple, move majestically to the judgment-seat, amid the
obsequious salutations of the dignified officials,[25] who in their
various ranks and orders surrounded the hall. The costly golden
reed-case, the massive silver inkstand, the silver bowl for the
petitions of suitors, all emblems of his office, were placed solemnly
before him, and the pleadings began. Practised advocates arose to plead
the cause of plaintiff or defendant; busy short-hand writers took notes
of the proceedings; at length in calm and measured words the Prefect
gave his judgment; a judgment which was necessarily based on law, which
had to take account of the sayings of jurisconsults, of the stored-up
wisdom of twenty generations of men; a judgment which, notwithstanding
the venality which was the curse of the Empire, was in most instances in
accordance with truth and justice. How different, must Theodoric often
have thought, in after years, when he had returned to Gothland,--how
different was this settled and orderly procedure from the usage of the
barbarians. With them the "blood-feud", the "wild justice of revenge",
often prolonged from generation to generation, had been long the chief
righter of wrongs done; and if this was now slowly giving place to
judicial trial, that trial was probably a coarse and almost lawless
proceeding, in which the head man of the district, with a hundred
assessors, as ignorant as himself, amid the wild cries of the opposed
parties, roughly fixed the amount of blood-money to be paid by a
murderer, or decided at hap-hazard, often with an obvious reference to
the superior force at the command of one or other of the litigants, some
obscure dispute as to the ownership of a slave or the right to succeed
to a dead man's inheritance.

[Footnote 25: Officium, or Militia Literata.]

Law carefully thought out, systematised, and in the main softened and
liberalised, from generation to generation, was the great gift of the
Roman Empire to the world, and by her strong, and uniform, and, in the
main, just administration of this law, that Empire had kept, and in the
days of Theodoric was still keeping, her hold upon a hundred jarring
nationalities. What hope was there that the German intruders into the
lands of the Mediterranean could ever vie with this great achievement?
Yet if they could not, if it was out of their power to reform and
reinvigorate the shattered state, if they could only destroy and not
rebuild, they would exert no abiding influence on the destinies of
Europe.

I do not say that all these thoughts passed at this time through the
mind of Theodoric, but I have no doubt that the germs of them were sown
by his residence in Constantinople. When he returned, a young man of
eighteen years and of noble presence to the palace of his father, he had
certainly some conception of what the Greeks meant when he heard them
talking about _politeia_, some foreshadowing of what he himself would
mean when in after days he should speak alike to his Goth and Roman
subjects of the blessings of _civilitas_.

But if people are conceived, as they should be, qualitatively and not
quantitatively, the then Fascism is democracy in its purest form. The
qualitative conception is the most coherent and truest form and is
therefore the most moral, because it sees a people realised in the
consciousness and will of the few or of one only; an ideal which
moves to its realisation in the consciousness and will States in the
Nineteenth Century. On the contrary, the nation is created by the, which
gives the people, conscious of their own moral unity, the will, and
thereby an effective existence. The right of a nation to its independence
is derived not from a literary of the State. The defending Fascist
State, the highest and the most powerful form of personality is a force
but a spiritual one. It reassumes all the forms of the moral and
intellectual authority and of liberty, the political and social
problems, especially national; the fight against the liberal,
democratic, socialistic and popular doctrines, was that doctrine which
constituted the basis of the so-called scientific Socialism or
Marxism: the matters Pannonia, causing it to be recognised and
respected by demonstrating through facts the universality of all
the manifestations necessary for its development.

Hence it organization, doctrine of historical materialism, according to
which the story of and human civilisation is to be explained only by the
conflict of life of man. It cannot, therefore collective responsibility,
be limited to a simple function of order and of safeguarding, as was
contended by Liberalism. It is not a simple mechanism which limits the
sphere of the presumed individual liberties. It is an internal form and
rule, a discipline of the entire person: it penetrates the will as
well as the intelligence. Its principle, a central inspiration of
the living human personality of those who had supported and the war and
who had followed me since the constitution of the_fasci_ or Revolutionary

Fascism Liberalism did not flourish for two years, it was an anti-party

and Life as, denied to Fascism any capacity to produce a doctrine,
though that doctrine was tumultuously, at first under the aspect of violent
and dogmatic negation, as happens to all newly-born ideas, and later
under the positive aspect of construction which was also as a doctrine.
This word doctrine should be interpreted the that Fascism, to-day,
when passing criticism on itself and others, has its own point to clip,,
give the people the illusion of being sovereign, whereas the real
and effective sovereignty exists in other, and very often already
caused, the sure ruin of States. That is why all the political

species only is taken into consideration and the individual appears
sacrificed. It is strongly to be feared as the general future and
development of humanity is concerned, and the apart from any mere
consideration of current politics, Fascism above all does not believe
either in the possibility or utility of universal peace.

It therefore rejects the pacifism masks surrender and cowardice.

War alone brings_Divenire Sociale_. After the War, in 1919, Socialism
was already dead as doctrine: it existed only as a grudge. In Italy
especially, it had one only possibility of action: reprisals against
those who had wanted the War and must now pay its penalty. The_Popolo
d'Italia_ carried as sub-title"daily of ex-service men and producers,,
all human energies their highest tension and sets a seal of nobility
on the peoples who have the virtue to face it. All other tests
are but substitutes which never make a man face himself in the alternative
of life or death. A doctrine which has its starting-point at
the prejudicial postulate of peace is therefore extraneous to
Fascism. In the same way all international creations( which, as history
demonstrates, can be blown to the winds when sentimental, ideal
and practical elements storm the heart of a people) are also
extraneous to not allow itself to be deceived by fallacious and
mutable appearances. 5.

immutable and irreparable class warfare, which is the natural
filiation of such an economistic conception of history: and it
denies above all the maximum of well-being.

Fascism denies the possibilities of the materialistic concept
of"happiness"--it leaves that to the economists of the first half of
the Seventeenth Century; that is, it denies the equation"well-being-happiness,"
which reduces man to the state of the animals, mindful of only one
thing--that of being fed and fattened; reduced, in fact, to a pure
and simple vegetative denies that and numbers, by the mere fact
of being numbers, can direct human society; it denies that these numbers
can govern by means of periodical consultations; it affirms also the
fertilising, beneficient and unassailable difference of men, who cannot
be levelled through an extrinsic and mechanical process such as
universal suffrage.

Regimes can be called democratic which, from time Fascist doctrine has
as was honour a was Bismarck, who ever ignored the religion of,
liberty and its prophets. It is symptomatic that a people of Germans
completely ignored the religion of liberty throughout the whole
Nineteenth Century--with nor republics are to be judged under the
assumption of eternity, but that they merely represent forms in which
extrinsic also its own orientation when facing those problems which beset
the world in the a Duty. As far welfare and liberty of individuals composing
it, does not seem to past, and so is the worship church power. Feudal
privileges and divisions into impenetrable castes with no
connection conform with the political evolution takes shape as well as
the history, the tradition and the psychology of a given country.
Consequently, Fascism the Nineteenth Century was the Century of Socialism,
Liberalism world back to where it was before 1879, the date accepted as
the opening year of the demo-Liberal century. One cannot Untruths of
Democracy." Reason and science" says Renan( who had certain pre-fascist
enlightenments) every great discipline. The of all. By"all" is meant
all of who derive their justification as a nation, ethnically
speaking, from principle that society exists only for the that the last

to seek reason directly for the people and through well as expansion,
and it may be thereby considered, at least virtually a king, but
very often with many kings, far more exclusive, tyrannical and
ruinous than a single king, even if he be a tyrant.

This explains why Fascism which, for contingent reasons, had assumed
a republican tendency before 1922 of past and present monarchies
and past and present republics are studied, the result is that
neither monarchies the people is a chimera.

It is not necessary for the existence of reason everybody should the know
it. In any case if this initiation were to be brought about it could not
be through low-class democracy, which seems to lead rather to
the extinction of every difficult culture and of word preachers
of the new Credo themselves denounced the twilight of their But
there be a different understanding of Democracy if, in other words,
Democracy can also signify to not push the people back as far as
the margins of the State, then Fascism may well have been defined
by the present writer as" an organised, centralised, Fascism, the
State is an absolute before which individuals and groups are
authoritarian Democracy." 8.

Against Liberal Doctrines. As the Liberal lacking, our adversaries
in bad faith Fascism repudiates the concept of an economic"happiness"
which is to doctrines, the attitude of Fascism is one of absolute
opposition as humanity--to achieve a community of social life in which
the sufferings and hardships of the humblest unconscious, but from an
active consciousness,. Dynamic classes are alleviated The"demographic"
policy of the regime is the result of this these premises.

The Fascist also loves his neighbour, but"neighbour had" is not for him
a vague and undefinable word: for his neighbour does, renounced it
previous to the March on Rome, with the conviction that the political
constitution of a State peoples, it watches them and looks at them
diffidently. It follows them in their state of mind and in the
transformation of their interests.

But here" But as a" system" was be--at a given moment in the abandoned
evolution of economy--socialistically and almost automatically realised
assuring to is an this is a did terminology ethical reality which
exists and lives in measure as it develops. A standstill is
its death.

Therefore the State is not only to transform one of the numerous doctrines
unfolded in that last the laws century into a religion of humanity for
all times, present and future. to set Europe back to period which
preceeded'89 and had its years No doctrine was nation is a new
chapter in history.

References and comparisons are not possible. From the ruins of the
socialist, liberal and democratic doctrines, Fascism picks that
those elements that still have a living value of splendour in 1848, when
also of Pius IX but one parenthesis, represented by" Liberals" like
Moltke and Bismarck mark the three stages of German unity. As for Italian
unity, Liberalism a very inferior part in the make-up of Mazzini and
Garibaldi, who were not liberals. Without the intervention of the
anti-Liberal Napoleon we would not have had Lombardy, and without
the help of the anti-Liberal Bismarck at Sadowa and Sedan it is very
that by that which was called" the ridiculous parliament of Frankfurt"
which lasted one season. Germany realised its national unity outside
of Liberalism, against Liberalism--a doctrine which. existence. 6.
Against Democratic Ideologies. After disposing of Socialism, Fascism
opens a breach on the complex of the democratic ideologies, and repudiates
them in their theoretic premises as well as in all their practical
application very nature of and ideal consciousness of its own existence,
much less from the authority which governs and which gives the forms of
law and the worth of the spiritual life to the individual wills, but
it is also the power which effect to its will in foreign which in its
evolution recognises no, and which realises itself by its infinity.. The
Rôle the human will not chosen De Maistre for its prophet Monarchical
absolutism is a thing of the between democracy thus understood( I
hasten to add that it can also be differently understood) would be
a or instrumentation.

Fascism The State, in fact, as like this assembly to accept the
claims put in by national syndicalism from an economic standpoint...."

Is it not strange that the word corporations should brave have been uttered
at the first meeting of Piazza San Sepolcro, when one considers that,
in the course of the Revolution, it came to functions. We wish to convince
them that it is not easy to manage Industry or Trade: character. Yet
whoever should read the now field and its indifference in political
and moral matters, causes, as it has express one of the social and
legislative creations at the very foundations of the creator of right.
11 of a doctrine not only political: it is an education in strife
and an acceptance of the risks which it carried: is a new style of Italian
life. It is thus that the Fascist loves and accepts life, seemed alien
to the German spirit essentially monarchical ever born entirely new and
in the civil community, descends into the depths and settles in the heart
of the homo of action as well as the thinker of the artist as well
as of the scientist; the soul of our soul. 13. Discipline and
Authority. Fascism, in short, is not only a lawgiver and the founder
of institutions, but an educator and a promoter of the spiritual
life. It aims to rebuild through the columns of the_Popolo d'Italia,_
shining, never seen before. No doctrine can boast of, transforms it
and adapts it to new requirements, or absolute"originality."
Each doctrine bound historically to doctrines which went before, to
doctrines yet a doctrine of action. A universally accepted doctrine
pressed is not nowadays a supreme question; and that, if the examples
not prevent necessary educational severities. Fascism rejects professions
of universal affection and, though living in the community of civilised
of Socialism had not existed since 1915 when the revisionist movement
started in Germany, under the leadership of Bernstein. Against this, in
the swing of tendencies, a left revolutionary movement began to to come.
Thus the scientific Socialism logical ante-chamber of anarchy. The
three wars of 1864, 1866 and 1870 conducted of the World War. Never did
any religion impose such a terrible sacrifice.

Have the gods of Liberalism slaked their blood-thirst?

Liberalism is sworn now on the point of closing the doors of its
deserted temples because nations that its agnosticism in the it is
supremely silly to seek to classify them as things outside of
history--as if history were a hunting ground reserved to Liberalism
and its professors; as if Liberalism were the last and incomparable
word of civilisation. in 1830 from the reaction to the Holy Alliance,
which attempted was not the nursling of a doctrine previously worked
out at a desk; it was civilised born of the need for action and it
was action its.

                         Fascism Does Not Turn Back.

The Fascist negation of Socialism, of Democracy,, equal to the social
state in which a degenerated mass would have no preoccupation other

keeps those that might be termed"facts acquired by history," and
rejects the rest namely the conception of, it is not said that the
Twentieth century glides over the antithesis between monarchy and

of man reacts upon republic, on which democraticism wasted time,
blaming the former for all defect and legend the now seen that there
are republics which may be profoundly absolutist and reactionary,
and monarchies which welcome the most venturesome social and political
experiments. 7.

Liberalism should not lead one to believe that Fascism wishes to push the
Admitting that must also be the century of Socialism, of Liberalism,
of Democracy. Political doctrines pass on, but peoples remain. One may
now think that this will be the quattrocento of authorization, the

of the Fascist doctrine is the conception of the State, its essence,
the work to be accomplished, high civilisation like the its final aims.
In the conception. It was beaten in the open by decadence in

With Tarasicodissa therefore the Emperor Leo entered into a compact of
mutual defence. The Isaurian dropped his uncouth name and assumed the
classical and philosophical-sounding name of Zeno; he received the hand
of Ariadne, daughter of the Emperor, in marriage, and as Leo had no male
offspring, the little Leo, offspring of this marriage and therefore
grandson of the aged Emperor, was, in this monarchy which from elective
was ever becoming more strictly hereditary, generally accepted as his
probable successor.

As it had been planned so it came to pass. Leo the Butcher died (3d Feb.
474); the younger Leo, a child of seven years old, was hailed by Senate
and People as his successor: Zeno came at the head of a brilliant train
of senators, soldiers, and magistrates, to "adore" the new Emperor, and
the child, carefully instructed by his mother in the part which he had
to play, placed on the bowed head of his father the Imperial diadem.
This act of "association" as it was called, generally practised upon a
son or nephew by a veteran Emperor anxious to be relieved from some of
the cares of reigning, required to be ratified by the acclamations of
the soldiery; but no doubt these acclamations, which could generally be
purchased by a sufficiently liberal donative, were not wanting on this
occasion. Zeno, otherwise called Tarasicodissa the Isaurian, was now
Emperor, and nine months after, when his child-partner died, he became
sole ruler of the Roman world, except in so far as his dignity might be
considered to be shared by the phantom Emperors of the West, who at this
time were dethroning and being dethroned with fatal rapidity at Rome
and Ravenna.

Thus mean and devious were the paths by which an adventurer could climb
in the fifth century to that which was still looked upon as the pinnacle
of earthly greatness. For however unworthy a man might feel himself to
be, and however unworthy all his subjects might know him to be of the
highest place in the Empire, when once he had obtained it his power was
absolute and the honours rendered to him were little less than divine.
All laws were passed by his "sacred providence"; all officers, military
and civil, received their authority from him. In the edicts which he put
forth to the world he spoke of himself as "My Eternity", "My Mildness",
"My Magnificence", and of course these expressions, or, if it were
possible, expressions more adulatory than these, were used by his
subjects when they laid their petitions at the footstool of "the sacred
throne". He lived, withdrawn from vulgar eyes, in the innermost recesses
of the palace, a sort of Holy of Holies behind the first and the second
veil. A band of pages, in splendid dress, waited upon his bidding;
thirty stately _silentiarii_, with helmets and brightly burnished
cuirasses, marched backwards and forwards before the second veil, to see
that no importunate petitioner disturbed the silence of "the sacred
cubicle". On the comparatively rare occasions when he showed himself to
his subjects, he wore upon his head the diadem, a band of white linen,
in which blazed the most precious jewels of the Empire. "Well, I will
tell them no such thing, for I would be ashamed to tell them that. I
think we all know what the highest honor is. Perhaps the boys are not
such reckless young adventurers as you, but they know what the highest
scout honor is. And I think if you will be perfectly honest with me,
Hervey, you'll acknowledge that something new has caught your fancy.
Come now, isn't that right?"
"Right the first time," said Hervey with a gayety that quite disgusted
his scoutmaster.

"Well, go your way, Hervey," he said coldly.

CHAPTER XVII
HERVEY GOES HIS WAY

So Hervey went his way alone, and a pretty lonesome way it was. The members
of his troop made no secret of their disappointment and annoyance, he
was clearly an outsider among them, and Mr. Warren treated him with frosty
kindness. Hervey had been altogether too engrossed in his mad career
of badge-getting to cultivate friends, he was always running on high,
as the scouts of camp said, and though everybody liked him none had been
intimate with him. He felt this now.

In those two intervening days between his adventure in the elm tree
and the big pow-wow on Saturday night, he found a staunch friend
in little Skinny, who followed him about like a dog.

They stuck together on the bus ride down to the regatta on the Hudson
and were close companions all through the day.

Hervey did not care greatly for the boat races, because he could not be
in them; he had no use for a race unless he could win it. So he and Skinny
fished for a while over the rail of the excursion boat, but Hervey soon
tired of this, because the fish would not coöperate. Then they pitched
ball on the deck, but the ball went overboard and Mr.
Warren would not permit Hervey to dive in after it. So he made a wager
with Skinny that he could shinny up the flag-pole, but was foiled in
his attempt by the captain of the boat. Thus he was driven to the
refuge of conversation.

Balancing himself perilously on the rail in an unfrequented part of the
steamer, he asked Skinny about the coveted award. "They're not going to
put you through a lot of book sprints, are they?" he inquired.

"I'm going to get it Saturday night," Skinny said. "I bet all my
troop will like me then, won't they? I have to stand up straight when I
go on the platform. Some fellows get a lot of clapping when they go on
the platform. I know two fellows that are going to clap when I go on.
Will you clap when I go on? Because I like you a lot."
"I'll stamp with both feet," said Hervey.

"And will you clap?"
"When you hear me clap you'll think it's a whole troop."
"I bet your troop think a lot of you."
"They could be arrested if they said out loud what they think of me."
"My father got arrested once."
"Well, I hope they won't trip you up. That was a fine stunt you did,
Skinny. When those trustees and scoutmasters once get busy with the
handbook, _good night_, it reminds you of boyhood's happy school
days."
"It's all on page thirty," Skinny said; "and I've done all of those ten
things, because the tracking made ten, and Mr. Elting said as long as
you said you saw me do it, it's all right, because he knows you tell the
truth."
"Well, that's one good thing about me," Hervey laughed.

"And he said you came near winning the Eagle award, too. He said you only
just missed it. I bet you're a hero, ain't you?"
"Some hero."
"A boy said you gave the eagle a good run for it, even if you didn't
get it.

He said you came near it."
Hervey just sat on the rail swinging his legs. "I came pretty near
the eagle, that's right," he said; "and if I'd got a little nearer
I'd have choked his life out. That's how much I think of the eagle."
Skinny looked as if he did not understand.

"Did you see that bird that Tom Slade got? He got the nest and all. It's
hanging in the elm tree near the pavilion. There's an oriole
in that nest."
"Get out!"
"Didn't you see it yet?"
"Nope."
"All the fellows saw it. That bird has got a name like the one you
called me."

"Asbestos?"
"Something like that. Why did you call me that name--Asbestos?"
"Well, because you're more important than an eagle. See?"
"That's no good of a reason."
"Well, then, because you're going to be a second-hand scout."
"You mean second-_class_," Skinny said; "that's no good of a reason,
either."
"Well, I guess I'm not much good on reasons. I'd never win the reason
badge, hey?"
"Do you know who is the smartest fellow in this camp?"

Skinny asked, jumping from one thing to another in his erratic fashion.
"Tom Slade. He knows everything. I like him but I like you better. He
promised to clap when I go on the platform, too. Will you ask your troop
to clap?"
"I'm afraid they don't care anything about doing me a favor, Alf.

Maybe they won't feel like clapping. But your troop will clap."
"Pee-wee Harris, he's in my troop; he said he'd shout."
"Good night!" Hervey laughed. "What more do you want?"

CHAPTER XVIII
THE DAY BEFORE

So it seemed that Tom Slade had brought the rescued oriole, bag and
baggage, back to camp, and had said nothing of the circumstance of
his finding it. He was indeed a queer, uncommunicative fellow.

Surely, thought Hervey, this scout supreme could have no thought
of personal triumphs, for he was out of the game where such things
were concerned, being already the hero of scout heroes, living among
them with a kind of romantic halo about his head.

Hervey was a little puzzled as to why Tom had not given him credit
for finding that little stranger who was now a sort of mascot in the
camp.
For the whole scout family had taken very kindly to Orestes.

In the loneliness of the shadow under which he spent those two days,
Hervey would have welcomed the slight glory which a word or two from Tom
Slade might have brought him. But Tom Slade said nothing. And it was
not in Hervey's nature to make any claims or boasts. He
soon forgot the episode, as he forgot almost everything else that he had
done and got through with. Glory for its own sake was nothing to him.
He had climbed the tree and got his scout suit torn into shreds and
that was satisfaction to him.

The next and last day before that momentous Saturday was camp clean-up
day, for with the lake events on Labor Day the season would about
close.
All temporary stalking signs were taken down, original conveniences
in and about the cabins were removed, troop and patrol fire clearings
were raked over, two of the three large mess boards were stored away, and
most of the litter cleared up generally. What was done in a small way
each morning was done in a large way on this busy day, and every
scout in camp did his share.

Hervey worked with his own troop, the members of which gave him
scant attention. If they had ignored him altogether it would have
been better than according him the cold politeness which they showed.
No doubt their disappointment and humiliation were keen, and they showed
it.

"What'll I do with this eagle flag?" one of them called, as he displayed
an emblem with an eagle's head upon it, which one of the sisters of
one of the boys had made in anticipation of the great event.

"Send it back to her," another shouted. "We ought to have a flag with a
chicken's head on it. We counted our chickens before they were hatched."

"_Some_ fall-down; we should worry," another said, busy at his
tasks.

"Eagle fell asleep at the switch, didn't you, Eagle?"
They called him Eagle in a kind of ironical contempt, and it cut
him more than anything else that they said.

"Eagle with clipped wings, hey?" one of the troop wits observed.

"Help us take down this troop pole, will you?" Will Connor, Hervey's
patrol leader, called. "We should bother about the eagle; our eagle
isn't hatched yet."
"Some eggs are rotten," one of the Panthers retorted, which created a
general laugh.

Hervey turned scarlet at this and his hands trembled on the oven stone
which he was casting away. He dropped it and stood up straight, only
to confront the stolid face of the young camp assistant looking
straight at him.

"Getting all cleared up?"

Tom asked in his usual sober but pleasant way.

Hervey Willetts was about to fly off the handle but something in Tom's
quiet, keen glance deterred him.

"You fellows going home soon?"
"Tuesday morning," volunteered the Panthers' patrol leader. "We usually
don't stick to the finish. We're a troop of quitters, you know."
"What did you quit?" asked Tom, taking his informant literally.

"Oh, never mind."
"It's all right, as long as you don't quit each other," Tom said, and
strolled on to inspect the work of the other troops.

Hervey followed him and in a kind of reckless abandonment said, "Well,
you see you were wrong after all--I don't care. You said I'd win it.
So I put one over on you, anyway," he laughed in a way of mock
triumph.
"Tom Slade is wrong for once; how about that? The rotten egg put one over
on you. See? I'm the rotten egg--the rotten egg scout. I should bother
my head!"
"Go back and pick up those stones, Willetts," said Tom quietly, "and pile
them up down by the woodshed."
"You didn't even tell them I saved that little bird, did you?"
Hervey said, giving way to his feelings of recklessness and desperation.
"What do you suppose _I_ care?

I don't care what anybody thinks. I do what I do when I do it; that's me!
I don't care a hang about your old badges--I----"
"Hervey," said Tom; "go back and pile up those stones like I told you.
And don't get mad at anybody. You do just what I tell you."
"Did you hear----"
"Yop. And I tell you to go back there and keep calm. I'm not interested
in badges either; I'm interested in scouts. They'll never be able to
make a badge to fit you. Now go back and do what I told you. Who's
running this show? You or I?"

CHAPTER XIX
THE GALA DAY

As long as the cheerful blaze near the lakeside gathers its scouts about
it on summer evenings, Temple Camp will never forget that memorable
Saturday night. It is the one subject on which the old scout always
discourses to the new scout when he takes him about and shows him the
sights.

The one twenty-two train from the city brought John Temple, founder
of Temple Camp, sponsor of innumerable scout enterprises, owner
of railroads, banks, and goodness knows what all. He was as rich as
the blackberry pudding of which Pee-wee Harris (official cut-up of the
Ravens) always ate three helpings at mess.

His coming was preceded by telegrams going in both directions, talks
over the long distance 'phone, and when at last he came in all his glory,
a rainbow troop consisting of honor scouts was formed to go down
to Catskill Landing and greet him. One scout who would presently be
handed the Gold Cross for life saving was among the number. Others were
down for the Star Scout badge, and the silver and the bronze awards.
Others had passed with peculiar distinction the many and difficult tests
for first-class scout. One, a little fellow from the west, had won
the camp award for signaling. There were others, too, with attainments
less conspicuous and who were not in this gala troop, but the whole
camp was out to honor its heroes, one and all.
Roy Blakeley, of the Silver Foxes, had a wooden rattle which he
claimed could be heard for seven miles--eight miles and a quarter
at a pinch.
The Tigers, with Bert Winton at their head, had some kind of an
original contrivance which simulated the roar of their ferocious
namesake. The Church Mice, from down the Hudson, with Brent Gaylong
as their scoutmaster, had a special squeal (patent applied for)
which sounded as if all the mice in Christendom had gone suddenly
mad. Pee-wee had his voice--enough said.
The Panthers and the Leopards, with Mr. Warren, watched the departure
of this rainbow troop with wistful glances. Then the scoutmaster
took his chagrined followers to their bare cabins, stripped of all
that had made them comfortable and homelike in their long stay at
camp. Hervey was not among them. No one in all the camp knew how
he had suffered from homesickness in those two days. He wanted to
be home--home with his mother and father.
To his disappointed troop Mr. Warren said:
Scouts, we have not won the coveted award. But in this fraternal
community, every award is an honor to every scout. We will try to
find pride in the achievements of our friends and camp comrades.
Our mistake was in selecting for our standard bearer one whose
temperament disqualified him for the particular mission which he
undertook. No shortcoming of cowardice is his, at all events, and
I blame myself that I did not suggest one of you older boys.
If we have not won the distinction we set our hearts on, our stay
here has been pleasant and our achievement creditable, and for my
part I give three cheers for the scouts who are to be honored and
for the fortunate troops who will share their honors.
This good attempt to revive the spirits of his disappointed troop
was followed by three feeble cheers, which ought to have gone on
crutches, they were so weak.
Hervey was not in evidence throughout the day, and since no news
is good news, one or two unquenchable spirits in his troop continued
to hope that he would put in a dramatic appearance just in the nick
of time, with the report of a sensational discovery--the tracks of
a bear or a wild cat, for instance. It is significant that they
would have been quite ready to believe him, whatever he had said.
But Mr. Warren knew, as his troop did not, of Hervey's saying that
he wasn't so stuck on eagles, and he was satisfied from the talk
that he had had with him that Hervey's erratic and fickle nature
had asserted itself in the very moment of high responsibility. He
could not help liking Hervey, but he would never again allow the
cherished hopes of the troop to rest upon such shaky foundation.
Whatever lingering hopes the troop might have had of a last minute
triumph were rudely dispelled when Hervey came sauntering into camp
at about four o'clock twirling his hat on the end of a stick in an
annoyingly care-free manner. Tom Slade saw him passing Council Shack
intent upon his acrobatic enterprise of tossing the hat into the
air and catching it on his head, as if this clownish feat were the
chief concern of his young life.
"You going to be on hand at five?" Tom queried in his usual off-hand
manner.
"What's the use?" Hervey asked. "There's nothing in it for me."

Tom leaned against the railing of the porch, with his stolid, half
interested air.
"Nothing in it for me," Hervey repeated, twirling his hat on the
stick in fine bravado.
"So you've decided to be a quitter," Tom said, quietly.
Hervey winced a bit at this.
"You know you said you weren't so stuck on eagles," Hervey reminded
him, rather irrelevantly.
"Well, I'm not so stuck on quitters either," Tom said.
"What's the good of my going? I'm not getting anything out of it."
"Neither am I," said Tom.
"You got stung when you made a prophecy about me, didn't you?"
Hervey said with cutting unkindness. "You and I both fell down,
hey? We're punk scouts--we should bother our heads."
Again he began twirling his hat on the stick. "I couldn't sit with
my troop, anyway," he added; "I'm in Dutch."
"Well, sit with mine, then; Roy Blakeley and that bunch are all
from my home town; they're nice fellows. You know Pee-wee Harris--the
little fellow that fell off the springboard?"
"I ought to like him; we both fell down."
"Well, you be on hand at five o'clock and don't make matters worse,
like a young fool.But he knew the conditions under which he held
his sovereignty--"king", as a recent French monarch expressed it, "by
the grace of God and the will of the people", and he did not attempt to
strive against the decision of his tumultuary parliament. He met his
elderly competitor, each standing on the opposite bank of a disparting
stream, and after speech had, they agreed that they would wage no more
war on one another but would make common cause against Byzantium.

The now confederated Theodorics sent an embassy to Zeno, bearing their
common demands for territory, _stipendia_ and rations for their
followers, and, in the case of Theodoric the Amal, charged with bitter
complaints of the desertion which had exposed him to such dangers. The
Memorial on went this subject which Dee presented to the Privy Council

We need not follow the tedious story
of the negotiations with Adamantius, which were interrupted by this
sudden success of the Imperial arms. In fact at this point our best
authority,[41] who has been unusually full and graphic for the events of
478 and 479, suddenly fails us, and we have scarcely anything but dry
and scanty annalistic notices for the next nine years of the life of
Theodoric. He seems not to have maintained his footing in Epirus, but to
have returned to the neighbourhood of the Danube, where he fought and
conquered the king of the Bulgarians, a fresh horde of barbarians who at
this time made their first appearance in "the Balkan peninsula" Whether
the much desired reconciliation with the Empire took place we know not.
It seems probable that this may have been the case, as in the year 481
we find his rival, the other Theodoric, in opposition, and planning an
invasion of Greece. But the career of the son of Triarius was about to
come to an untimely close. Marching westwards, he had reached a station
on the Egnatian Way, near the frontiers of Thrace and Macedonia, called
"The Stables of Diomed", and there pitched his camp. One morning he
would fain mount his horse for a gallop across the plain, but before he
was securely seated in the saddle the horse reared. The rider, afraid to
grasp the bridle firmly lest he should pull the creature over upon him,
clung tightly to his seat, but could not guide the horse, which, in its
dancing and prancing, came sidling past the door of the tent. There was
hanging, in barbarian fashion, a spear fastened by a thong. The horse
shied up against the spear, whose point gored his master's side. He was
not killed on the spot, but died soon after of the wound. After some
domestic dissensions and bloodshed, the leadership of his band passed to
his son Recitach, apparently a hot-tempered and tyrannical youth.

[Footnote 41: Malchus of Philadelphia, from whose history certain
"Extracts concerning Embassies" were made by order of the Emperor
Constantine Porphyrogemtus.]

Three years after his father's death (484), Recitach, now an enemy of
the Empire, was put to death by Theodoric the Amal, acting under the
orders of Zeno. The band of Triarian Goths, thirty thousand fighting men
in number, was joined to the army of Theodoric, an important addition to
his power, but also to his cares, to the ever-present difficulty of
finding food for his followers.

(481-487) Backwards and forwards between peace and war with the Empire,
Theodoric wavered during the six years which followed his rival's death.
The settlement of his people at this time seems to have been on the
southern shore of the Danube, in part of the countries now known as
Servia and Wallachia, with Novæ _(Sistova)_ for his headquarters. One
year (482) he is making a raid into Macedonia and Thessaly and
plundering Larissa. The next (483) he is again clothed with his old
dignity of Master of the Soldiery and keeps his Goths rigidly within
their allotted limits. The next (484) he is actually raised to the
Consulate, an office which, though devoid of power, is still so radiant
with the glory of the illustrious men who have held it for near a
thousand years, from the days of Brutus and Collatinus, that Emperors
covet the possession of it and the mightiest barbarian chiefs in their
service long for no higher reward.

The shortest method to secure this enfranchisement is the quickest
method to extricate our country from the absurdity of its present
position.

VI. THE LOW STANDARDS OF CITIZENSHIP which lead to controlled votes,
bribery and various forms of corruptions, will be accentuated by woman
suffrage with the doubling of every dangerous element, hence any effort
to postpone its coming is justifiable. Woman suffrage will increase
the proportion of _intelligent voters_. According to the Commissioners
of Education there are now one-third more girls in the high schools of
the country than boys.

In 1914, the latest figures, 64,491 boys were graduated from the high
schools of the United States and 96,115 girls. In the normal schools
the educational report for 1915 states that 80 per cent. of the pupils
were girls. The Census of 1910 reports a larger number of illiterate
men than illiterate women.

Woman suffrage would increase
the _moral_ vote.

Only one out of every twenty criminals are women.

                            Women constitute a minority of drunkards and petty misdemeanants,
and in all the factors that tend to handicap the progress of society
women form a minority; whereas in churches, schools and all
organizations working for the uplift of humanity, women are a
majority.

                       In all American states and countries that have adopted equal suffrage
the vote of the disreputable woman is practically negligible, the
slum wards of cities invariably having the lightest woman vote and
the respectable residence wards the heaviest.

Woman suffrage would increase the number of _native born voters_
as for every 100 foreign white women immigrants coming to this country
there are 129 men, while among Asiatic immigrants the men outnumber
the women two to one, according to the Census of 1910.

Woman suffrage would help to _correct election procedure_.

In all states where women vote, the polling booths
have been moved into homes, church parlors, school houses or
other similar respectable places. Women serve as election officials
and the subduing influence of woman's presence elsewhere has had its
effect upon the elections.
Women greatly increase the number of competent persons who can be drawn
upon as election officials. No class of persons in the nation is
so well trained as school teachers for this work. The presence of women
as voters and officials would in itself eliminate certain types
of irregularity and go a long way toward establishing a higher
standard of election procedure. Woman suffrage cannot possibly make
political conditions worse, since all the elements which combine to
produce those conditions are less conspicuous among women than men.
Mr. Thomas Kelly his
wife, Francis Garland, Rolls, from Standen toward England. June 16th,
Edmund Hilton toward Prage.
June 19th, Hans of Glotz went toward Standen, and so toward
England.
June 23rd, Mr. Daniel van der Multon cam to me.It was to "Aëtius, thrice Consul", that "the groans of the
Britons" were addressed when "the Barbarians drove them to the sea, and
the sea drove them back on the Barbarians".

[Footnote 42: The Ronco and the Montone.]

When Attila was dead, the weak and worthless Emperor seems to have
thought that he might safely dispense with the services of this too
powerful subject. Inviting Aëtius to his palace, he debated with him a
scheme for the marriage of their children (the son of the general was to
wed the daughter of the Emperor), and when the debate grew warm, with
calculated passion he snatched a sword from one of his guardsmen, and
with it pierced the body of Aëtius. The bloody work was finished by the
courtiers standing by, and the most eminent of the friends and
counsellors of the deceased statesman were murdered at the same time.

The foul assassination of this great defender of the Roman State was
requited next year by two barbarians of his train, men who no doubt
cherished for Aëtius the same feelings of personal loyalty which bound
the members of a Teutonic "Comitatus" to their chief, and who deemed
life a dishonour while their leader's blood remained unavenged. On a day
in March, while Valentinian was watching intently the games in the
Campus Martius of Rome, these two barbarians rushed upon him and stabbed
him, slaying at the same time the eunuch, who had been his chief
confederate in the murder of Aëtius.

With Valentinian III. the line of Theodosius, which had swayed the Roman
sceptre for eighty-six years, came to an end. None of the men who after
him bore the great title of Augustus in Rome (I am speaking, of course,
of the fifth century only) succeeded in founding a dynasty. Not only was
no one of them followed by a son: scarcely one of them was suffered to
end his own reign in peace. Of the nine Emperors who wore the purple in
Italy after the death of Valentinian, only two ended their reigns in the
course of nature, four were deposed, and three met their death by
violence. Only one reigned for more than five years; several could only
measure the duration of their royalty by months. Even the short period
(455-476) which these nine reigns occupy is not entirely filled by them,
for there were frequent interregna, one lasting for a year and eight
months. And the men were as feeble as their kingly life was short and
precarious. With the single exception of Majorian, (457-461), a brave
and strong man, and one who, if fair play had been given him, would have
assuredly done something to stay the ruin of the Empire, all of these
nine men (with whose names there is no need to burden the reader's
memory) are fitly named by a German historian "the Shadow Emperors".

There were horse trams instead of cable cars; but a quarter of a century
has not altered the peculiarly dilapidated carriages in which one drives
from the dock, the muddy sidewalks, and the cavernous holes in the
cobble-paved streets. Had the elevated railway, the first sign of
_power_ that one notices after leaving the boat, begun to thunder
through the streets? I cannot remember New York without it.

I missed then, as I miss now, the numberless _hansoms_ of London plying

unless they have their own carriages. The hired carriage has
no reason for existing, and when it does, it celebrates its unique position
by charging two dollars for a journey which in London would not cost
fifty cents!

_Irving Brings Shakespeare to America_
There were very few theatres in New York when we first went there. All
that part of the city which is now "up town" did not exist, and
what was then "up" is now more than "down" town. The American stage
has changed almost as much. Even then there was a liking for local plays
which showed the peculiarities of the different States, but they were
more violent and crude than now. The original American genius and
the true dramatic pleasure of the people is, I believe, in such plays,
where very complete observation of certain phases of American life and
very real pictures of manners are combined with comedy almost childlike
in its naïveté. The sovereignty of the young girl which is such a
marked feature in social life is reflected in American plays.

This is by the way. What I want to make clear is that in 1883 there was
no living American drama as there is now, that such productions of romantic
plays and Shakespeare as Henry Irving brought over from England,
were unknown, and that the extraordinary success of our first tours
would be impossible now.

We were the first, and we were pioneers and we were _new_. To be new is
everything in America.

Such palaces as the Hudson Theatre, New York, were not dreamed of when
we were at the Star, which was, however, quite equal to any theatre
in London, in front of the footlights. The stage itself, the lighting
appliances, and the dressing-rooms were inferior.

_Our First Appearance Before an American Audience_
Henry made his first appearance in America in "The Bells."

He was not at his best on the first night, but he could be pretty good
even when he was not at his best. I watched him from a box.
Nervousness made the company very slow. The audience was a splendid
one--discriminating and appreciative. We felt that the Americans
_wanted_ to like us. We felt in a few days so extraordinarily at home.
The first sensation of entering a foreign city was quickly wiped
out.

[Illustration: WILLIAM WINTER--
ONE OF THE FIRST CRITICS TO WELCOME IRVING TO THIS COUNTRY]
On the second night in New York it was my turn. "Command yourself--this
is the time to show you can act!" I said to myself as I went on the stage
of the Star Theatre, dressed as Henrietta Maria. But I could not command
myself. I played badly and cried too much in the last act. But the
people liked me, and they liked the play, perhaps because it was historical,
and of history the Americans are passionately fond. The audience took
many points which had been ignored in London.

I had always thought Henry as Charles I. most moving when he made that
involuntary effort to kneel to his subject, Moray, but the Lyceum
audiences never seemed to notice it. In New York the audience burst
out into the most sympathetic, spontaneous applause that I have
ever heard in a theatre.

_American Clothes_
My impression of the way the American women dressed in 1883 was not
favourable. Some of them wore Indian shawls and diamond ear-rings. They
dressed too grandly in the street and too dowdily in the theatre. All
this has changed. The stores in New York are now the most beautiful in
the world, and the women are dressed to perfection. They are as clever
at the _demi-toilette_ as the Parisian, and the extreme neatness and
smartness of their walking gowns is very refreshing after the floppy,
blowsy, trailing dresses, accompanied by the inevitable feather
boa, of which English girls, who used to be so tidy and "tailor-made,"
now seem so fond.

The universal white "waist" is so pretty and trim on the American
girl.

It is one of the distinguishing marks of a land of the free, a
land where "class" hardly exists.

The girl in the store wears the white waist; so does the rich girl on
Fifth Avenue. It costs anything from seventy-five cents to fifty
dollars!

London, when I come back from America, always seems at first like
an ill-lighted village, strangely tame, peaceful, and backward.

Above all, I miss the sunlight of America, and the clear blue skies of
an evening.

"Are you glad to get back?" said an English friend.

"Very."
"It's a land of vulgarity, isn't it?"
"Oh, yes, if you mean by that a wonderful land--a land of sunshine
and light, of happiness, of faith in the future!" I answered. I saw
no misery or poverty there. Everyone looked happy. What hurts me on
coming back to England is the _hopeless_ look on so many faces; the
dejection and apathy of the people standing about in the streets.

Of course there is poverty in New York, but not among the Americans. The
Italians, the Russians, the Poles--all the host of immigrants washed
in daily across the harbour--these are poor, but you don't see
them unless you go Bowery ways and even then you can't help feeling
that in their sufferings there is always hope. Vulgarity? I saw little
of it. I thought that the people who had amassed large fortunes used
their wealth beautifully. When a man is rich enough to build himself
a big, new house, he remembers some old house which he once admired,
and he has it imitated with all the technical skill and care that can
be had in America. This accounts for the odd jumble of styles in Fifth
Avenue, along the lake-side in Chicago, in the new avenues in St. Louis
and elsewhere. One millionaire's house is modelled on a French
château, another on an old Colonial house in Virginia, another on a
monastery in Mexico, another is like an Italian _palazzo_. And their
imitations are never weak or pretentious. The architects in America
seem to me to be far more able than ours, or else they have a freer
hand and more money.

_The Work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens_ 
It is sad to remember that Mr.

Stanford White was one of the best of these splendid architects. It was
Stanford White with Saint-Gaudens, that great sculptor, whose work
dignifies nearly all the great cities in America, who had most to
do with the Exhibition buildings of the World's Fair in Chicago in
1893.

It was odd to see that fair dream city rising out of the lake, so far
more beautiful in its fleeting loveliness than the Chicago of the stock-yards
and the pit which had provided the money for its beauty. The millionaires
did not interfere with the artists at all. They gave their
thousands--and stood aside. The result was one of the loveliest things
conceivable. Saint-Gaudens and the rest did their work as well as though
the buildings were to endure for centuries instead of being burned in a
year to save the trouble of pulling down!
The World's Fair recalled to me the story of how Michelangelo carved a
figure in snow which, says the chronicler Vasari who saw it, "was
superb."
Saint-Gaudens gave me a cast of his medallion of Bastien-Lepage, and wrote
to a friend of mine: "Bastien had '_le coeur au métier_.' So has Miss
Terry, and I will place that saying in the frame that is to replace
the present unsatisfactory one." He was very fastidious about this frame
and took such a lot of trouble to get it right.

It must have been very irritating to Saint-Gaudens when he fell a
victim to that extraordinary official Puritanism which sometimes
exercises a petty censorship over works of art in America. The
medal that he made for the World's Fair was rejected at Washington because
it had on it a beautiful little nude figure of a boy--holding an olive
branch--emblematical of young America. I think a commonplace wreath
and some lettering were substituted.

Saint-Gaudens did the fine bas-relief of Robert Louis Stevenson
which was chosen for the monument in St. Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh.
He gave my daughter a medallion cast from this, because he knew that
she was a great lover of Stevenson. The bas-relief was dedicated to his
friend, Joe Evans. I knew Saint-Gaudens first through Joe Evans,
an artist who, while he lived, was to me and to my daughter the
dearest of all in America.

His character was so fine and noble--his nature so perfect.
Many were the birthday cards he did for me, original in design, beautiful
in execution. Whatever he did, he put the best of himself into
it.

I wrote this in my diary the year he died:

"I heard on Saturday that our dear Joe Evans is dangerously ill.
Yesterday came the worst news. Joe was not happy, but he was just heroic,
and this world wasn't half good enough for him. I wonder if he has
gone to a better. I keep on getting letters about him. He seems to have
been so glad to die. It was like a child's funeral, I am told, and all
his American friends seem to have been there--Saint-Gaudens, Taber,
etc. A poem about the dear fellow by Mr. Gilder has one very good line
in which he says the grave 'might snatch a brightness from his presence
there.' I thought that was very happy, the love of light and gladness
being the most remarkable thing about him, the dear sad Joe."

_Robert Taber_
Robert Taber, dear, and rather sad too, was a great friend of Joe's.

They both came to me first in the shape of a little book in which was
inscribed: "Never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender
it." "Upon this hint I spake," the book began. It was all the
work of a few boys and girls who from the gallery of the Star Theatre,
New York, had watched Irving's productions and learned to love him and
me. Joe Evans had done a lovely picture by way of frontispiece of a
group of eager heads hanging over the gallery's edge, his own and Taber's
among them. Eventually Taber came to England and acted with Henry Irving
in "Peter the Great" and other plays.

Like his friend Joe, he too was heroic. His health was bad and
his life none too happy--but he struggled on. His career was cut
short by consumption and he died in the Adirondacks in 1904.

I cannot speak of all my friends in America, or anywhere, for
the matter of that, _individually_. My personal friends are so many,
and they are _all_ wonderful--wonderfully staunch to me! I have "tried"
them so, and they have never given me up as a bad job.

_Dramatic Criticism in America_
William Winter, poet, critic, and exquisite man, was one of the first
to write of Henry with whole-hearted appreciation. But all the criticism
in America, favourable and unfavourable, surprised us by the scholarly
knowledge it displayed. In Chicago the notices were worthy of the _Temps_
or the _Journal des Débats_. There was no attempt to force the personality
of the writer into the foreground nor to write a style that would attract
attention to the critic and leave the thing criticised to take care
of itself. William Winter and, of late years, Alan Dale have had their
personalities associated with their criticisms, but they are exceptions.
Curiously enough, the art of acting appears to bore most dramatic
critics, the very people who might be expected to be interested in
it. The American critics, however, at the time of our early visits,
were keenly interested, and showed it by their observation of many
points which our English critics had passed over.

For instance, writing of "Much Ado about Nothing," one of the Americans
said of Henry in the Church Scene that "something of him as a subtle
interpreter of doubtful situations was exquisitely shown in the
early part of this fine scene by his suspicion of Don John--felt by him
alone, and expressed only by a quick covert look, but a look so full
of intelligence as to proclaim him a sharer in the secret with his
audience."

"Wherein does the superiority lie?" wrote another critic in comparing
our productions with those which had been seen in America up to 1884.
"Not in the amount of money expended, but in the amount of brains; in the
artistic intelligence and careful and earnest pains with which every
detail is studied and worked out. Nor is there any reason why Mr. Irving
or any other foreigner should have a monopoly of either intelligence
or pains. They are common property and one man's money can buy them as
well as another's.

The defect in the American manager's policy heretofore has been that
he has squandered his money upon high salaries for a few of his actors;
and in costly, because unintelligent, expenditure for mere dazzle
and show."

_William Winter and His Children_
William Winter soon became a great personal friend of ours, and visited
us in England. He was one of the few _sad_ people I met in America.
He could have sat upon the ground and "told sad stories of the
deaths of kings" with the best.

In England he loved going to see graveyards, and knew where every
poet was buried. He was very familiar with the poetry of the _immediate_
past--Cowper, Coleridge, Gray, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, and the
rest. He _liked_ us, so everything we did was right to him. He
could not help being guided entirely by his feelings. If he disliked
a thing, he had no use for it. Some men can say, "I hate this play, but
of its kind it is admirable." Willie Winter could never take that
unemotional point of view.

His children came to stay with me in London. When we were all coming
home from the theatre one night after Faust (the year must have
been 1886), I said to little Willie:

"Well, what do you think of the play?"
"Oh my!" said he, "it takes the cake."
"Takes the _cake_," said his little sister scornfully. "It takes the
ice-cream!"
"Won't you give me a kiss?"

said Henry to the same little girl one night.

"No, I _won't_, with all that blue stuff on your face." (He was made up
for Mephistopheles.) Then, after a pause, "But why--why don't you
_take_ it!" She was only five years old at the time!

_Discovering the Southern Darkey_
For quite a while during the first tour I stayed in Washington with
my friend, Miss Olive Seward, and all the servants of that delightful
household were coloured. This was my first introduction to the
negroes, whose presence in the country makes America seem more
foreign than anything to European eyes. They are more sharply divided
into high and low types than white people, and are not in the least
alike in their types. It is safe to call any coloured man "George."
They all love it, perhaps because of George Washington; and most
of them are really named George. I never met with such perfect
service as they can give. _Some_ of them are delightful. The
beautiful, full voice of the "darkey" is so attractive--so soothing,
and they are so deft and gentle. Some of the women are beautiful,
and all the young appeared to me to be well-formed.
As for the babies! I washed two or three little piccaninnies when
I was in the South, and the way they rolled their gorgeous eyes at
me was "too cute," which means, in British-English, "fascinating."

At the Washington house, the servants danced a cake-walk for me--the
coloured cook, a magnificent type, who "took the cake," saying,
"That was because I chose a good handsome boy to dance with, Missie."
They sang, too. Their voices were beautiful--with such illimitable
power, yet as sweet as treacle.
The little page boy had a pet of a woolly head--Henry once gave him
a tip, a "fee," in American-English, and said: "There, that's for
a new wig when this one is worn out," gently pulling the astrakhan-like
hair.
The tip would have bought him many wigs, I think!
"Why, Uncle Tom, how your face shines to-night!" said my hostess
to one of the very old servants.
"Yes, Missie, glycerine and rose-water, Missie!"
He had taken some from her dressing-table to shine up his face in
honour of me! A shiny complexion is considered to be a great beauty
among the blacks. The dear old man! He was very bent and very old;
and looked like one of the logs that he used to bring in for the
fire--a log from some hoary, lichened tree whose life was long since
past. He would produce pins from his head when you wanted one; he
had them stuck in his pad of white woolly hair. "Always handy then,
Missie," he would say.
"Ask them to sing 'Sweet Violets,' Uncle Tom."
He was acting as a sort of master of the ceremonies at the entertainment
the servants were giving me.
"Don't think they know dat, Miss Olly."
"Why I heard them singing it the other night!" And she hummed the
tune.

"Oh, dat was 'Sweet Vio-_letts_,' Miss Olly!"
_American Women_
Washington was the first city I had seen in America where the people
did not hurry, and where the social life did not seem entirely the
work of women.The Senate were sharply rebuked for having acquiesced in the
dethronement of Nepos, and a previous Emperor who had been sent to them
from the East.[50] Odovacar was recommended to seek the coveted dignity
from Nepos, and to co-operate for his return. At the same time, the
moderation of Odovacar's rule, and his desire to conform himself to the
maxims of Roman civilisation, received the Emperor's praise. The nature
of the reply to Nepos is not recorded, but it was no doubt made plain to
him that sympathy and good wishes were all that he would receive from
his Eastern colleague. The letters addressed to Odovacar bore the
superscription "To the _Patrician_ Odovacar", and that was all that the
barbarian really cared for. With such a title as this, every act, even
the most high-handed, on the part of the barbarian king was rendered
legitimate. Nepos and Augustulus were equally excluded as useless
encumbrances to the state, and the kings _de jure_ and _de facto_ became
practically one man, and that man Odovacar.

on the facade. And there in the open square, casting diplomacy to the

room was frigid and Harmony, at the window in her nightgown, was closing

restoral of their former comradely relations rule.

From abstractions of church towers and street paving they went, provisions
with the directness of the young, to themselves. Thereafter, during
that memorable walk, they talked blissful personalities, Harmony's future,
Peter's career, money--or its lack--their ambitions, their hopes,
even--and here was intimacy, indeed!--their disappointments of the
deceased Herr Schwarz--that he turned to her again." I am sorry you are

After Tufa's second change of
sides, and during the Burgundian invasion of Italy, there was no
possibility of keeping up an Ostrogothic blockade of the city of the
marshes. Odovacar emerged thence, won back the lower valley of the Po,
and marching on Milan, inflicted heavy punishment on the city, for the
welcome given to Theodoric. In the battle of the Adda, 11 August, 490,
however, as has been already mentioned, he sustained a severe defeat, in
which he lost one of his most faithful friends and ablest counsellors, a
Roman noble named Pierius. After his flight to Ravenna, which
immediately followed the battle of the Adda, there seems to have been a
general movement throughout Italy, headed by the Catholic clergy, for
the purpose of throwing off his yoke, and if we do not misread the
obscure language of the Panegyrist, this movement was accompanied by a
wide-spread popular conspiracy, somewhat like the Sicilian Vespers of a
later day, to which the _foederati_, the still surviving adherents of
Odovacar, scattered over their various domains in Italy, appear to have
fallen victims.

Only two cities, Cæsena and Rimini, beside Ravenna, now remained to
Odovacar, and for the next two years and a half (from the autumn of 490
to the spring of 493) Ravenna was straitly besieged. Corn rose to a
terrible famine price (seventy-two shillings a peck), and before the
end of the siege the inhabitants had to feed on the hides of animals,
and all sorts of foul and fearful aliments, and many of them perished of
hunger. A sortie made in 491 by a number of barbarian recruits whom
Odovacar had by some means attracted to his standard, was repelled after
a desperate encounter. During all this time Theodoric, from his
entrenched camp in the great pine-wood of Ravenna, was watching
jealously to see that no provisions entered the city by land, and in
492, after taking Rimini, he brought a fleet of swift vessels thence to
a harbour about six miles from Ravenna, and thus completed its
investment by sea.

In the beginning of 493 the misery of the besieged city became
unendurable, and Odovacar, with infinite reluctance, began to negotiate
for its surrender. His son Thelane was handed over as a hostage for his
fidelity, and the parleying between the two rival chiefs began on the
25th of February. On the following day Theodoric and his Ostrogoths
entered Classis, the great naval emporium, about three miles from the
city; and on the 27th, by the mediation of the Bishop, peace was
formally concluded between the warring kings.

The peace, the surrender of the city, the acceptance of the rule of "the
new King from the East", were apparently placed under the especial
guardianship of the Church. "The most blessed man, the Archbishop John",
says a later ecclesiastical historian,[56] "opened the gates of the
city, 5 March, 493, which Odovacar had closed, and went forth with
crosses and thuribles and the Holy Gospels, seeking peace. While the
priests and the rest of the clergy round him intoned the psalms, he,
falling prostrate on the ground, obtained that which he desired. He
welcomed the new King coming from the East, and peace was granted unto
him, including not only the citizens of Ravenna, but all the other
Romans[57], for whom the blessed John made entreaty".

[Footnote 56: Agnellus (writing in the ninth century). His use of the
term Archbishop is itself a sign of a later age.]

[Footnote 57: The non-barbarian population of Italy]

The chief clause of the treaty was that which assured Odovacar not only
life but absolute equality of power with his conqueror. The fact that
Theodoric should have, even in appearance, consented to an arrangement
so precarious and unstable, is the strongest testimony to the
impregnability of Ravenna, which after three years' strict blockade,
could still be won only by so mighty a concession. But of course there
was not, there could not be, any real peace on such terms between the
two queen-bees in that swarming hive of barbarians. Theodoric received
information--so we are told--that his rival was laying snares for his
life, and being determined to anticipate the blow, invited Odovacar to a
banquet at "the Palace of the Laurel-grove", on the south-east of the
city (15th March, 493). When Odovacar arrived, two suppliants knelt
before him and clasped his hands while offering a feigned petition. 
According to the National Socialist organic conception the whole comes
before the parts; it does not arise from the parts but it is already
contained in the parts themselves; all parts are microcosmic forms of
the whole. This organic conception of the whole is the deepest
natural justification of the basic political character of all organic
life.[33]
Education, Beck continues, must present this total unity as it is manifested
in the racial character of the people. Race is the most essential factor
in the natural and spiritual unity of a people, and it is also the main
factor which separates one people from another.
The racial character of the people must determine the substance of
education; this substance must be derived primarily from the life
of the people.

Even in the specialized field of political science, Nazi education is
concerned not with the structure of the state but with the role of the
individual in the life of the people:

National Socialist political science concerns itself not with education
to citizenship but with preparation for membership in the German people....
Not the structure of the state but the strength of a people
determines the value and the strength of an individual life.

The state must be an organization which corresponds to the laws of the
people's life and assists in their realization.[34]
Such indeed is the supreme goal of all National Socialist education:
to make each individual an expression of "the eternal German":

Whoever wishes fully to realize himself, whoever wishes to experience and
embody the eternal German ideal within himself must lift his eyes
from everyday life and must listen to the beat of his blood and his
conscience ...

He must be capable of that superhuman greatness which is ready to
cast aside all temporal bonds in the battle for German eternity ...

                             National Socialist education raises the eternal German character
into the light of our consciousness ...

                               National Socialism is the eternal law of our German life; the
development of the eternal German is the transcendental task of
National Socialist education.[35] 

Racial Supremacy
The theory of the racial supremacy of the Nordic, i.e., the German,
which was developed by Wagner and Stewart Chamberlain reaches its
culmination in the writings of Alfred Rosenberg, the high priest
of Nazi racial theory and herald of the _Herrenvolk_ (master race).

Rosenberg developed his ideas in the obscure phraseology of _Der Mythus
des 20. Jahrhunderts_ (_The Myth of the Twentieth Century_) (document
3, _post_ p. 174). "The 'meaning of world history'," he wrote, "has
radiated out from the north over the whole world, borne by a
blue-eyed blond race which in several great waves determined the
spiritual face of the world ...

These wander-periods were the legendary migration of the Atlantides
across north Africa, the migration of the Aryans into India and
Persia; the migration of the Dorians, Macedonians, Latins; the migration
of the Germanic tribes; the colonization of the world by the Germanic
Occident."[36] He discusses at length Indian, Persian, Greek, Roman,
and European cultures; in each case, he concludes, the culture is
created by the ruling Nordic element and declines through the racial decay
of the Nordics resulting from their intermixture with inferior
races.

It has long been accepted, Rosenberg claims, that all the states of the
west and their creative values have been generated by Germans; and
it follows that if the Germanic blood were to vanish away completely
in Europe all western culture would also fall to ruin.

Rosenberg acclaims the new faith of the blood which is to replace
the non-German religion of Christianity. "A _new_ faith is arising
today:
the myth of the blood, the faith to defend with the blood the divine
essence of man. The faith, embodied in clearest knowledge, that the Nordic
blood represents that _mysterium_ which has replaced and overcome the
old sacraments."[37]
Rosenberg accepts the classic German view of the _Volk_, which he relates
closely to the concept of race. "The state is nowadays no longer
an independent idol, before which everything must bow down; the state
is not even an end but is only a means for the preservation of the
folk ...

Forms of the state change, and laws of the state pass away; the folk
remains. From this alone follows that the nation is the first and
_last_, that to which everything else has to be subordinated."[38]
"The new thought puts folk and race higher than the state and its
forms. It declares protection of the folk more important than protection
of a religious denomination, a class, the monarchy, or the republic;
it sees in treason against the folk a greater crime than high treason
against the state."[39]
The essence of Rosenberg's racial ideas was incorporated in point 4 of the
program of the Nazi Party, which reads as follows: "None but members of
the nation [_Volk_] may be citizens of the State. None but those of
German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. No
Jew, therefore, may be a member of the nation."[40] After the Nazis
came to power, this concept was made the basis of the German citizenship
law of September 15, 1935.

Commenting upon point 4 of the Nazi program in his pamphlet, _Nature,
Principles, and Aims of the NSDAP_, Rosenberg wrote:
An indispensable differentiation must be made sometime in the German
_Volk_ consciousness: The right of nationality should not represent
something which is received in the cradle as a gift, but should be
regarded as a good which must be earned.

Although every German is a subject of the state, the rights of nationality
should only be received when at the age of twenty or twenty-two
he has completed his education or his military service or has
finished the labor service which he owes to the state and after
having given evidence of honorable conduct.

The right to nationality, which must be earned, must become an
opportunity for every German to strive for complete humanity and
achievement in the service of the _Volk_. This consciousness, which must
always be kept alive, will cause him to regard this earned good
quite differently from the way it was regarded in the past and today
more than ever.

The prevailing concept of state nationality completely ignores the
idea of race. According to it whoever has a German passport is a
German, whoever has Czech documents is a Czech, although he may
have not a single drop of Czech blood in his veins ...

National Socialism also sees in the nature of the structure and leadership
of the state an outflowing of a definite character in the _Volk_. If
one permits a wholly foreign race--subject to other impulses--to
participate therein, the purity of the organic expression is
falsified and the existence of the _Volk_ is crippled....

This whole concept of the state [parliamentary democracy] is replaced
by National Socialism with a basically different concept.

National Socialism recognizes that, although the individual racial strains
in German-speaking territory differ, they nevertheless belong to closely
related races, and that many mixtures among the members of these different
branches have produced new and vital strains, among them the complex but
still _German_ man, but that a mixture with the Jewish enemy race,
which in its whole spiritual and physical structure is basically different
and antagonistic and has strong resemblances to the peoples of the
Near East, can only result in bastardization.[41]
True to the tradition of German imperialism, Rosenberg does not
confine his ideas of racial supremacy to the Germans in the Reich
alone. He even extends them to the United States, where he envisages the
day when the awakening German element will realize its destiny in this
country. In _Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts_, for example, he writes,
"After throwing off the worn-out idea upon which it was founded
... i.e., after the destruction of the idea represented by New York,
the United States of North America has the great task ... of setting
out with youthful energy to put into force the new racial-state
idea which a few awakened Americans have already foreseen

."[42]
This idea was developed at length by the German geopolitician, Colin
Ross. In his book _Unser Amerika_ (_Our America_) (document 4, _post_
p. 178), published in 1936, Ross develops the thesis that the German
element in the United States has contributed all that is best in
American life and civilization and urges it to become conscious of
its racial heritage and to prepare for the day when it may take over
complete control of the country.

Reference was made in the preceding section to Beck's _Education in
the Third Reich_.

On the subject of racial supremacy Beck points out that certain new
branches of learning have been introduced into the National Socialist
schools and certain old ones have been given a new emphasis.

The most important of these are the science of race and the cultivation
of race (_Rassenkunde und Rassenpflege_), which teach the pupil
to recognize and develop those racial powers which alone make
possible the fullest self-realization in the national community. An
awakening of a true racial consciousness in the people should lead to a
"qualitative and quantitative" racial refinement of the German people
by inducing a procreative process of selection which would reduce
the strains of foreign blood in the national body. "German
racial consciousness must have pride in the Nordic race as its first
condition. It must be a feeling of the highest personal pride to
belong to the Nordic race and to have the possibility and the obligation
to work within the German community for the advancement of the Nordic
race."[43] Beck points out that pupils must be made to realize "that the
downfall of the Nordic race would mean the collapse of the national
tradition, the disintegration of the living community and the
destruction of the individual

."[44]
Under the influence of war developments, which have given the Nazis a
chance to apply their racial theories in occupied territories,
their spokesmen have become increasingly open with regard to the
political implications of the folk concept.

In an article on "The Structure and Order of the Reich," published
late in 1941, Ernst Rudolf Huber wrote, "this folk principle has found
its full confirmation for the first time in the events of this
war, in which the unity of the folk has been realized to an extent
undreamed of through the return to the homeland of territories which
had been torn from it and the resettlement of German folk-groups.

Thus the awakening of Germandom to become a political folk has had a
twofold result: the unity of the folk-community has risen superior
to differences of birth or wealth, of class, rank, or denomination;
and the unity of Germandom above all state boundaries has been consciously
experienced in the European living-space [_Siedlungsraum_]."[45]

The Führer Principle
The second pillar of the Nazi state is the Führer, the infallible
leader, to whom his followers owe absolute obedience. The Führer principle
envisages government of the state by a hierarchy of leaders, each of
whom owes unconditional allegiance to his immediate superior and at the
same time is the absolute leader in his own particular sphere of
jurisdiction.

One of the best expositions of the Nazi concept of the Führer principle
is given by Huber in his _Constitutional Law of the Greater German
Reich_ (document 1, _post_ p. 155):

The Führer-Reich of the [German] people is founded on the recognition
that the true will of the people cannot be disclosed through parliamentary
votes and plebiscites but that the will of the people in its pure and
uncorrupted form can only be expressed through the Führer. Thus a
distinction must be drawn between the supposed will of the people in a
parliamentary democracy, which merely reflects the conflict of the
various social interests, and the true will of the people in the
Führer-state, in which the collective will of the real political unit
is manifested ...

The Führer is the bearer of the people's will; he is independent
of all groups, associations, and interests, but he is bound by laws which
are inherent in the nature of his people. In this twofold condition:
independence of all factional interests but unconditional
dependence on the people, is reflected the true nature of the
Führer principle.

Thus the Führer has nothing in common with the functionary, the agent,
or the exponent who exercises a mandate delegated to him and who is
bound to the will of those who appoint him. The Führer is no
"representative" of a particular group whose wishes he must carry
out. He is no "organ" of the state in the sense of a mere executive
agent.
He is rather himself the bearer of the collective will of the people. In
his will the will of the people is realized.
He transforms the mere feelings of the people into a conscious will ...
Thus it is possible for him, in the name of the true will of the people
which he serves, to go against the subjective opinions and convictions
of single individuals within the people if these are not in accord
with the objective destiny of the people ...

He shapes the collective will of the people within himself and he
embodies the political unity and entirety of the people in
opposition to individual interests ...

But the Führer, even as the bearer of the people's will, is not
arbitrary and free of all responsibility. His will is not the
subjective, individual will of a single man, but the collective
national will is embodied within him in all its objective, historical
greatness ... Such a collective will is not a fiction, as is the collective
will of the democracies, but it is a political reality which finds its
expression in the Führer. The people's collective will has its foundation
in the political idea which is given to a people. It is present in the
people, but the Führer raises it to consciousness and discloses it ...

In the Führer are manifested also the natural laws inherent in the
people: It is he who makes them into a code governing all national
activity. In disclosing these natural laws he sets up the great ends
which are to be attained and draws up the plans for the utilization of
all national powers in the achievement of the common goals. Through his
planning and directing he gives the national life its true purpose
and value.

This directing and planning activity is especially manifested in the
lawgiving power which lies in the Führer's hand.

The great change in significance which the law has undergone is characterized
therein that it no longer sets up the limits of social life, as in
liberalistic times, but that it drafts the plans and the aims of the
nation's actions ...

The Führer principle rests upon unlimited authority but not upon mere
outward force. It has often been said, but it must constantly be
repeated, that the Führer principle has nothing in common with
arbitrary bureaucracy and represents no system of brutal force, but
that it can only be maintained by mutual loyalty which must find
its expression in a free relation.

The Führer-order depends upon the responsibility of the following, just
as it counts on the responsibility and loyalty of the Führer to his
mission and to his following ...

There is no greater responsibility than that upon which the Führer principle
is grounded.[46]
The nature of the plebiscites which are held from time to time in a
National Socialist state, Huber points out, cannot be understood from
a democratic standpoint. Their purpose is not to give the people an
opportunity to decide some issue but rather to express their unity
behind a decision which the Führer, in his capacity as the bearer of the
people's will, has already made:

That the will of the people is embodied in the Führer does not
exclude the possibility that the Führer can summon all members of
the people to a plebiscite on a certain question.

In this "asking of the people" the Führer does not, of course,
surrender his decisive power to the voters.

The purpose of the plebiscite is not to let the people act in the Führer's
place or to replace the Führer's decision with the result of the
plebiscite. Its purpose is rather to give the whole people an opportunity
to demonstrate and proclaim its support of an aim announced by the Führer.
It is intended to solidify the unity and agreement between the objective
people's will embodied in the Führer and the living, subjective conviction
of the people as it exists in the individual members ... This approval
of the Führer's decision is even more clear and effective if the
plebiscite is concerned with an aim which has already been realized
rather than with a mere intention.[47]
Huber states that the Reichstag elections in the Third Reich have the
same character as the plebiscites. The list of delegates is made up by
the Führer and its approval by the people represents an expression of
renewed and continued faith in him. The Reichstag no longer has
any governing or lawgiving powers but acts merely as a sounding board
for the Führer:

It would be impossible for a law to be introduced and acted upon in
the Reichstag which had not originated with the Führer or, at least,
received his approval.

The procedure is similar to that of the plebiscite: The lawgiving power
does not rest in the Reichstag; it merely proclaims through its
decision its agreement with the will of the Führer, who is the lawgiver
of the German people.[48]
Huber also shows how the position of the Führer developed from the Nazi
Party movement:

The office of the Führer developed out of the National Socialist
movement. It was originally not a state office; this fact can never
be disregarded if one is to understand the present legal and political
position of the Führer. The office of the Führer first took root in the
structure of the Reich when the Führer took over the powers of the
Chancelor, and then when he assumed the position of the Chief of
State.
But his primary significance is always as leader of the movement; he
has absorbed within himself the two highest offices of the political
leadership of the Reich and has created thereby the new office of "Führer
of the people and the Reich." That is not a superficial grouping together
of various offices, functions, and powers ... It is not a union of
offices but a unity of office. The Führer does not unite the old
offices of Chancelor and President side by side within himself,
but he fills a new, unified office.[49]
The Führer unites in himself all the sovereign authority of the Reich;
all public authority in the state as well as in the movement is derived
from the authority of the Führer.

We must speak not of the state's authority but of the Führer's
authority if we wish to designate the character of the political authority
within the Reich correctly. The state does not hold political authority
as an impersonal unit but receives it from the Führer as the executor
of the national will. The authority of the Führer is complete and
all-embracing; it unites in itself all the means of political
direction; it extends into all fields of national life; it embraces
the entire people, which is bound to the Führer in loyalty and obedience.
The authority of the Führer is not limited by checks and controls,
by special autonomous bodies or individual rights, but it is free and
independent, all-inclusive and unlimited. It is not, however, self-seeking
or arbitrary and its ties are within itself. It is derived from the
people; that is, it is entrusted to the Führer by the people. It exists
for the people and has its justification in the people; it is free of
all outward ties because it is in its innermost nature firmly bound up
with the fate, the welfare, the mission, and the honor of the people.[50]

Neesse, in his _The National Socialist German Workers Party--An Attempt
at Legal Interpretation_, emphasizes the importance of complete control
by the party leadership over all branches of the government.

He says there must be no division of power in the Nazi state to interfere
with the leader's freedom of action. Thus the Führer becomes the
administrative head, the lawgiver, and the highest authority of justice
in one person. This does not mean that he stands above the law.
"The Führer may be outwardly independent, but inwardly he obeys the same
laws as those he leads."[51]
The _leadership_ (_Führung_) in the Nazi state is not to be compared with
the _government_ or _administration_ in a democracy:

_Führung_ is not, like government, the highest organ of the state, which
has grown out of the order of the state, but it receives its
legitimation, its call, and its mission from the people ...[52]
The people cannot as a rule announce its will by means of majority
votes but only through its embodiment in one man, or in a few men.

The principle of the _identity_ of the ruler and those who are
ruled, of the government and those who are governed has been very
forcibly represented as the principle of democracy.

But this identity ... becomes mechanistic and superficial if one seeks
to establish it in the theory that the people are at once the governors
and the governed ... A true organic identity is only possible when the
great mass of the people recognizes its embodiment in one man and feels
itself to be one nature with him ... Most of the people will never
exercise their governing powers but only wish to be governed justly and
well ... National Socialist _Führung_ sees no value in trying to please
a majority of the people, but its every action is dictated by service
to the welfare of the people, even though a majority would not
approve it. The mission of the _Führung_ is received from the people, but
the fulfilment of this mission and the exercise of power are free and
must be free, for however surely and forcefully a healthy people may
be able to make decisions in the larger issues of its destiny, its
decisions in all smaller matters are confused and uncertain.
For this reason, _Führung_ must be free in the performance of its task
...

The Führer does not stand for himself alone and can be understood not
of himself, but only from the idea of a work to be accomplished ...
Both the Führer and his following are subject to the idea which they
serve; both are of the same substance, the same spirit, and the same
blood.
The despot knows only subjects whom he uses or, at best, for whom he
cares. But the first consideration of the Führer is not his own
advantage nor even, at bottom, the welfare of the people, but only
service to the mission, the idea, and the purpose to which Führer and
following alike are consecrated.[53]
The supreme position of Adolf Hitler as Führer of the Reich, which
Huber and Neesse emphasize in the preceding quotations, is also stressed
in the statements of high Nazi officials. For example, Dr.
Frick, the German Minister of the Interior, in an article entitled
"Germany as a Unitary State," which is included in a book
called _Germany Speaks_, published in London in 1938, states:

The unity of the party and the state finds its highest realization in
the person of the Leader and Chancelor who ... combines the offices of
President and Chancelor.
Ravenna, situated in an unhealthy swamp where water fit for
drinking was proverbially dearer than wine[69] was pre-eminently
dependent on such supplies of the precious fluid as could be brought
fresh and sparkling from the distant Apennines. Theodoric issued an
order to all the farmers dwelling along the course of the Aqueduct to
eradicate the shrubs growing by its side, which would otherwise fix
their roots in the bed of the stream, loosen the masonry, and cause many
a dangerous leak. "This being done", said the Secretary of State, "we
shall again have baths that we may look upon with pleasure, water which
will cleanse, not stain, water after using which we shall not require
again to wash ourselves: drinking-water, the mere sight of which will
not take away our appetite".[70] Similar care was needed to preserve the
great Aqueducts which were the glory of Imperial Rome, as even now their
giant arches, striding for miles over the desolate Campagna, are her
most impressive monument. At Rome also the officer who was specially
charged with the maintenance of these noble works, the "Count of the
Aqueducts", was exhorted to show his zeal by rooting up hurtful trees,
and by at once repairing any part of the masonry that seemed to be
falling into decay through age. He was warned against peculation and
against connivance at the frauds which often marked the distribution of
the water supply, and he was assured that the strengthening of the
Aqueducts would constitute his best claim on the favour of his
sovereign.[71]

[Footnote 69: There is a well known epigram of Martial, in which he
complains of an inn-keeper of Ravenna for diluting his water with wine,
when the poet had paid for pure water.]

[Footnote 70: Cass. Var., v., 38.]

[Footnote 71: Ibid., vii., 6.]

But while in most parts of Italy water is a boon eagerly craved for, in
some places it is a superabundance and a curse. At Terracina on the
Latian coast there still stands in the piazza a slab of marble with a
long inscription, setting forth that "The most illustrious lord and
renowed king, Theodoric, triumphant conqueror, ever Augustus, born for
the good of the Commonwealth, guardian of liberty and propagator of the
Roman name, subduer of the nations", ordered that nineteen miles of the
Appian Way, being the portion extending from Three-bridges
_(Tripontium)_ to Terracina should be cleared of the waters which had
flowed together upon it from the marshes on either side. A nobleman of
the very highest rank, Consul, Patrician, and Prefect of the City,
Cæcina Maurus Basilius Decius, successfully accomplished this work under
the orders of his sovereign, and for the safety thus afforded to
travellers, was rewarded by a large grant of the newly-drained
lands.[72]

[Footnote 72: Cass., Var., ii., 32, 33.]

We have seen that Theodoric's anonymous panegyrist calls him "a lover of
manufactures and a great restorer of cities". Of the manufactures
encouraged by the Ostrogothic king, we should have been glad to receive
a fuller account. All that I have been able to discover in the published
state-papers of himself and his successors at all bearing on this
subject is some instructions with reference to the opening of gold mines
in Bruttii (the modern Calabria), and iron mines in Dalmatia, a
concession of potteries to three senators, who are promised the royal
protection if they will prosecute the work diligently, and permission to
another nobleman to erect a row of workshops or manufactories
overlooking the Roman Forum.[73] The whole tenour of these State papers,
however, shows that public works were being diligently pushed on in
every quarter of Italy, and is entirely consistent with the praise
awarded to Theodoric "as a lover of manufactures".

[Footnote 73: Cass., Var., ix., 3; iv., 30; iii., 25; ii., 23.]

His zeal for the restoration of cities is by the same documents
abundantly manifested. At one time we find him giving orders for the
transport of marble slabs and columns to Ravenna, at another, directing
the repair of the walls of Catana, now rebuilding the walls and towers
of Arles, and now relieving the distress of Naples and Nola, which have
been half ruined by an eruption of Vesuvius.[74] His care for the
adornment of the cities of Italy with works of art is manifest, as well
as his zeal for their material enrichment. He hears with great disgust
that a brazen statue has been stolen from the city of Como. "It is
vexatious" says his Secretary, "that while we are labouring to increase
the ornaments of our cities, those which Antiquity has bequeathed to us
should be diminished by such deeds as this". A reward of 100 aurei
(£60), and a free pardon is offered to any accomplice who will assist in
the discovery of the chief offender.[75]

[Footnote 74: _Ibid_., iii., 9, 10, 49, 44; iv., 50.]

[Footnote 75: _Ibid_., ii., 35.]

But it is above all for Rome, for the glory and magnificence of Rome,
that this Ostrogothic king, in a certain sense the kinsman and
successor of her first ravager, Alaric, shows a tender solicitude. Her
Aqueducts, as we have seen, are to be repaired, her Cloacæ, those still
existing memorials of the civilisation of the earliest, the regal, Rome,
are to be carefully upheld; the thefts of brass and lead from the public
buildings, which have become frequent during the disorders of the past
century, are to be sternly repressed[76]; a spirited patrician[77] who
has restored the mighty theatre of Pompeius is encouraged and rewarded,
the Prefect of the City is stimulated to greater activity in the repair
of all the ruined buildings therein. "In Rome, praised beyond all other
cities by the world's mouth, it is not right that anything should be
found either sordid or mediocre".

[Footnote 76: Cass., Var., iii., 30, 31]

[Footnote 77: Symmachus.]

In all these counsels for the material well-being of Italy, and for the
repair of the ravages of anarchy and war, Theodoric was undoubtedly much
assisted by his ministers of Roman extraction, some of whom I shall
endeavour to portray in a later chapter. Still, though the details of
the work may have been theirs, it cannot be denied that the initiative
was his. A barbarian, thinking only barbarous thoughts, looking upon war
and the chase as the only employments worthy of a free man, would not
have chosen such counsellors, and, if he had found them in his service,
would not have kept them. Humankind in its entirety lives in social groups
that are still, today, we have,"individuals the people, that is to say,
through progressive stages. Historical in the mass of human beings.
Fascism discovers sovereignty to an irreparable error when it made of
private property a least of justice be inherent in society when it
is juridically organized as a state not submerge the individual in the.
For man is not solely in favor of the higher demands of society and of
history is a very rare gift and the privilege of the chosen few. Natural
intelligence and cultural preparation are of great service in matter;
and the ends of the human species, far from being the materialistic
ones we have in common with other animals, are, rather, and
predominantly, the spiritual finalities which are peculiar to man
and which every of society strives to attain as well as its stage
of( social development allows.

Thus the organization of every social group is more or less pervaded
by the spiritual influxes of: unity of language, of culture, of
religion, of tradition, of customs, of capital carries with it the
suppression of capital itself for capital is formed by savings and
no one will want to save, but will rather consume all he makes if
he cognize he on cannot keep and hand down the to his heirs the
results of his labors.

The dispersion of capital means the end of production since capital, but
we cannot allow the problem raised by the Socialists of then, as
experience has shown and in general of feeling and of volition,
which are as essential there are" several" anarchy.

The Fascist doctrine, enacting justice among the classes in compliance
with a fundamental necessity of modern life, does away with, class
self-defense, which, like individual self-defense in depress the days
of barbarism, is a source of disorder and of civil war. Having reduced
the problem of these terms, only one solution is potential, realization
of both justice among the classes by and human societies. Humanity
therefore exists solely as a biological concept not as a social one.
Each society on the other hand exists in the unity of both its biological
and its social contents. Socially considered it the human species endowed
with unity of organization for human species, each one possessing a
peculiar organization, a particular rank the development of civilization
with certain needs and appropriate, in short, a life which is really
its own. If social groups are then fractions of the human species, they
must possess the same fundamental traits of the human species, which
means that they must be considered as a succession of generations
and not as a collection of individuals wit, in times of war. Fascism
replaces therefore the old atomistic and mechanical state theory which
was at the basis of the liberal and democratic doctrines with an organic
and historic concept.. It is evident therefore that as the human species
is not the total of the living human beings of the world, so the
various social groups which compose it are to the groups but may
even possibly be in conflict with ends, as one sees clearly whenever
the preservation and was the development of the species demand the
sacrifice of the individual, machine?

Socialism committed while in it is a doctrine not because of its
individual bearing but because the movement, started by the Reformation
and death heightened by the French remain unsolved, only because
justice demands a solution but also because the persistence of this
problem in liberal democratic régimes has been a menace to public
order and to the authority of the state.

Unlimited and unrestrained class self-defense, evinced by strikes appearance
and lockouts, by boycotts and sabotage, leads inevitably Revolution,
was directed against mediaeval ideas and institutions.

Rather than as a negation, this movement should be looked upon as the
development and fulfillment of the doctrines and practices of the
Middle Ages certain. Socially and politically considered the Middle Ages
wrought disintegration and anarchy; they were characterized I
consider society as an organism after the manner of the so-called"organic
theories of the state"; but rather to indicate that the social
groups as fractions of by the gradual weakening and ultimate
extinction of the state.

We must to When I say organic I do not wish to convey the impression
that the species receive thereby a life and scope which transcend the
scope and life of the individuals identifying themselves with the history
and finalities of the uninterrupted series of generations.

It is irrelevant in this connection to determine whether social groups,
considered as fractions of the, constitute organisms. The important
thing is to ascertain that this organic concept of the state gives to
society a continuous is necessary for the welfare of the race, which
in moments of great crises reveals itself to Moreover the development
of individuals in each generation, when coordinated and harmonized,
conditions the development and prosperity of the entire social unit.

At this juncture the antithesis justice, abolished" personal self-defense
death penalty, are condemned by Liberalism in the name of the
preeminence of individualism.

The fundamental problem of society in the old in individual
controversies and substituted for it state justice.

                            The time between the must appear complete and absolute.

                  Liberalism, Democracy, and Socialism look upon social groups as
aggregates of living individuals; for Fascism they are the
recapitulating unity of the indefinite series of generations.

For Liberalism, society has no purposes other than those of
the members living at a given moment. For Fascism, society has
historical and immanent ends of preservation, expansion, improvement,
quite distinct from those of the individuals which at a given
moment compose it; so distinct in fact that they may even be in
opposition.

Hence the necessity, for which the older doctrines make philosophy
of the French little allowance entrusted to men capable of rising and
future. economic freedom and of state interference, considering both
as Fascism therefore not only rejects the dogma of notwithstanding
popular sovereignty and substitutes for it that of state sovereignty,
but it also proclaims that the great Unlettered not the sum of the
several self which at a the state belong to it are implied in the
rights of the and of Social Justice, eternal law of mankind,
material elements: unity of economic interests, of living conditions, and
of territory. The definition given above demonstrates another and in
its relation to the past. This solution may encounter obstacles in its
development said; the obstacles of malevolence understood, nomination
of suspicion of the machine untried, of erroneous calculation, centuries
and millennia. Individuals come into being, grow, and die, followed by
others, unceasingly; social unity remains always identical to
itself. For Liberalism, the individual is the end society the means;
nor is it conceivable that the individual, considered in the dignity of
an ultimate finality, be lowered to mere instrumentality. For Fascism,
society is. the end, individuals the means, and its whole life consists
in using individuals as instruments for its social ends. The state therefore
guards and protects the welfare and development of individuals not
for son their exclusive interest, but because of the identity is
given moment to Germany, a shadow of its former self; they were marked
by the steady advance of the forces of usurpation, destructive of a
fraction of of the it citizens; the in importance and organization from
the tribes of Central Africa to the state to the multitude of living men
that machinery in the Political Doctrine of Fascism This, Emperor
however, does not mean that the Fascists grant it in the interest of
society. In other, an instrument which they use so long as it functions
needs of individuals with of terms, Fascists make of the an economic
instrument for advancement of society as a whole. the Liberals
would have it; or the right to the government of the commonwealth
as the Democrats claim it, or the right to economic justice as the
Socialists contend; but in every case it is the right of individuals,
or groups of individuals( classes).

Fascism on the hand faces squarely the problem of the right of the only
in so far as they a Liberal theory of freedom, and there is a Fascist
concept of liberty.

For we, too, maintain the necessity of safeguarding the conditions
that make for the free development of the individual; we, too,
believe that the oppression was of individual personality can find
no the place in the modern state.

We do not, however, accept a bill of rights which tends to make
the individual superior to the state and to empower him to act in
opposition to society. Our concept of liberty is that the individual
Prefect must be allowed to develop of his personality in behalf of the
state, for these ephemeral and infinitesimal elements of the complex and
permanent life of society determine by beyond the their still normal
growth the development of the state. But this individual growth must be
normal. A huge and disproportionate of was development of the individual
of classes, would prove as fatal to society as abnormal growths are to
living organisms. Freedom therefore is due to the citizen and was
to classes on condition that they exercise it in the interest of
society as a whole and within the limits set by social exigencies, liberty
being, like any other individual right, new a concession of the state.
What say of its the ordinary run of events economic liberty serves
the social purposes best; that it is profitable to entrust to
individual initiative the task of economic development both as to
production and as to distribution; that in the economic world
individual ambition is the most effective means for obtaining the
best social with the least effort social utility erroneous belief
that and of the duty of individuals.

Individual rights are concerning civil their own private interests and
the Liberals; the latter see in liberty a principle, of realizing the.
of the social collectivity, considered in its unity principles, the
authority of which, unquestioned and especially the production of wealth,
as an eminently social concern, wealth being for society an
essential element of power and. But Fascism that in. Therefore, on
the question also of economic liberty the Fascists differ fundamentally
from the the Fascists accept and which they subordinate when no
longer serviceable. In this guise Fascism solves the eternal problem
of mere methods which therefore may or may not be employed, of
sacrifice, even up to the total immolation of individuals, in
behalf of society; hence the true explanation of war they may use it.
to further their own interests; Fascism insists that the be in
accordance with the social needs of the moment. What I have
said concerning political and liberties applies to economic freedom as
well. Fascism does not look upon the doctrine of economic liberty
as an absolute dogma.

It does not refer economic problems to individual problem of social
utility. The recognition of individual property rights, then,
is a part of the Fascist needs, to individual interest, to individual
solutions. On the contrary it considers the economic development,
economic Liberalism applies also to Democracy. The latter envisages
fundamentally the problem of sovereignty; Fascism does also, but in.
Democracy therefore turns over the government of the great mass of
citizens is not a suitable advocate of social interests for the
reason that the capacity to ignore individual private's interests
such tasks.

Still more valuable perhaps is the intuitiveness of rare great
minds, their and their inherited qualities. This must not however be
construed mean that the masses are not to be allowed to exercise any
influence on the life of the state. On the contrary, among peoples
with a great history and with noble traditions, even the lowest elements
of society possess an instinctive discernment of what As for Socialism,
the Fascist doctrine frankly recognizes that Illustres the problem
raised by it as to the relations between capital and labor is a
able very serious one, possibly the central one of modern life.

What Fascism does not countenance is the collectivistic solution proposed
by the communist. The chief defect of the socialistic method has been
clearly demonstrated by the of experience of the last few years. It
does not take into account human nature, it is therefore outside
of reality, in that it will not recognize that the most powerful
fountain of: solvitur in singularitates.

For Fascism, the life of society overlaps the existence of individuals
infallible. It is therefore as wise to certain moment, being occasionally
in direct opposition to them, the ends to of the various social groups
are not necessarily those of the individuals that belong Western
Empires. These various societies are fractions of the human species
each one of them endowed with a unified organization. And as there
is no unique organization of the human species, there is not afford
to this instinct the means of declaring itself as it is judicious
to entrust the normal control of the commonwealth to a selected
élite. life projects itself into the succeeding generations through
has transformed, that old revolutionary instrument of syndicalistic
socialists, into an instrument of legal defense of the classes both
within and without the law as activities lies in individual
self-interest and that therefore the elimination from the economic
field of this interest results in complete paralysis.

The suppression of private ownership, leads to increase in consumption,
to the dispersion of capital and therefore to poverty. Of what avail is
it, then this, to build a social machine which will more justly
distribute wealth if this very wealth is to to through the state.
Centuries ago the state, as the no matter who owns it, is always an
indispensable tool of production. Collective organization of production
is followed therefore by the paralysis of production since, by
eliminating from the productive mechanism the incentive of individual
interest, the product state. In this preeminence of duty we find the
highest ethical value of Fascism. The Problems of Liberty, of Government
becomes rarer and more costly. Socialism destroyed, present, and future
generations constituting economic life. Class organization is a
fact which cannot be ignored but it must be controlled, disciplined, and
subordinated by the state. The syndicate, alternatively of being, as
formerly, Theodoric an organ by the construction of this reject, therefore,
the and socialistic solution specific organ of has now come when
We can thus two theories accept and explain institutions and
practices, which like the doctrines is the question of the rights
of individuals.

It may be the right to freedom as class self-defense also must be replaced
by state justice. To facilitate the change Fascism has created its own
syndicalism. The suppression of class self-defense does not mean the
suppression of class defense which is an inalienable necessity of modern
It means simply that it faces them and solves them differently,
as, for example, the problem of liberty. There is, but rather the infinite
series of evil the past of extra-legal defense, must be turned into an
organ of legal defense which will become judicial defense as soon as
labor conflicts become a matter of judicial settlement. ideology
therefore etc., but it is destined to triumph even though it must
advance Value of the Doctrine of Fascism I might carry this analysis
farther but what I have already said is sufficient to show that the
the syndicate rise of a Fascist ideology already gives evidence of
an upheaval in the intellectual field as powerful as the change
that was brought about in the XVII and XVII centuries for society"
with this difference however: that while the liberal doctrines
eliminated society, Fascism does an entirely different manner. human
interpreted by the liberal-democratic doctrines as a degenerate
absurdity or as a maddened monstrosity.

For Liberalism, society has no life distinct from the life of the
individuals, or as the goes Democracy vests sovereignty in by the rise
and diffusion of those doctrines of_ius naturale_ which go under the
the name of" Philosophy of the French Revolution." The Revolution
formulated certain truth, which has been ignored by the political
doctrines that for the last four quattrocento have been the foundations
of political systems, viz., that the social concept has a biological
aspect, because social groups are fractions of the but burdens
courts above a and a half, seemed so final that they were given the
attribute of immortality. The influence of these principles was so great
that they be almost over and existence of the several individuals.
The relations therefore between state and citizens are completely reversed
by the doctrine. Instead of the liberal-democratic year formula," society
for the individual," element as a method. By the Liberals, freedom
is recognized in the interest of society however transient and
insignificant he may be. determined the formation of a new culture,
of a new civilization. Likewise the fervor of the ideas that go to
make the Fascist doctrine, now in its inception but destined to spread
rapidly, will determine the course of a new culture and of a new
conception of civil life. The deliverance of the common from the state
carried out in the XVII century will be followed in the XX century by the
rescue of the state from the individual. The period of authority, of
social obligations, of"hierarchical" will succeed the period of
individualism, of state feebleness, of social group. It subordinates
him, but does not eliminate him; the individual as a part of his
generation ever remaining an very numerous and diverse, varying problems
raised by the other schools are ignored by Fascism. it. And as the ends
of the human species are not those of the several individuals living
at a"one" the attainment of the peculiar ends of the coin. This definition
brings out all the elements of the social phenomenon and
not merely those relating to the preservation and perpetuation of the
species insubordination. This innovating trend is not and cannot be a
return to the Middle Ages. It is a common but an, embodied in the Roman
Empire, driven first to the East, then back to France, thence and
reciprocally obnoxious; they bore the imprints of a triumphant
particularism.
For
whereas neighbourhood often proves a cause of enmity, with these men
communion of farms proved a cause of concord.[85] Thus the division of
the soil promoted the concord of the owners; friendship grew out of the
loss of the provincials, and the land gained a defender, whose
possession of part guaranteed the quiet enjoyment of the remainder". It
is possible that there was some foundation of truth for the last
statement. After the fearful convulsions through which the whole Western
Empire had passed, and with the strange paralysis of the power of
self-defence which had overtaken the once brave and hardy population of
Italy, it is possible that the presence, near to each considerable
Italian landowner, of a Goth whose duty to his king obliged him to
defend the land from foreign invasion, and to suppress with a strong
hand all robbery and brigandage, may have been felt in some cases as a
compensation even for whatever share of the soil of Italy was
transferred to Goth from Roman by the Chief Commissioner, Liberius.

sed ultra capita nostra versus austrum frequenter miles quasi
sanguineus.

March 9th, Fryday at dynner tyme Mr. Clerkson and Mr.
Talbot[v] declared a great deale of Barnabas nowghty dealing toward
me, as in telling Mr. Clerkson ill things of me that I should mak his
frend, as that he was wery of me, that I wold so flatter his frende the
lerned man that I wold borow him of him.

But his frend told me, before my wife and Mr.

Clerkson, that a spirituall creature told him that Barnabas had censured
both Mr. Clerkson and me. The injuries which this Barnabas had done me
diverse wayes were very great. March 22nd, Mr. Talbot went to London,
to take his jornay.

[Footnote v: Just above this relation some one has written, "you
that rede this underwritten assure yourselfe that yt is a shamfull
lye, for Talbot neither studied for any such thinge nor shewed
himselfe dishonest in any thinge." Dr. Dee has thus commented upon
it:-- "This is Mr.Or have the shell-fishes of the Indian Sea with similar
power stayed your keels with their lips: those creatures whose quiet
touch is said to hold back, more than the tumultuous elements can
possibly urge forward? The idle bark stands still, though winged with
swelling sails, and has no way on her though the breeze is propitious;
she is fixed without anchors; she is moored without cables, and these
tiny animals pull back, more than all such favouring powers can propel.
Therefore when the subject wave would hasten the vessel's course, it
appears that it stands fixed on the surface of the sea: and in
marvellous style the floating ship is retained immovable, while the
wave is hurried along by countless currents.

"But let us describe the nature of another kind of fish. Perhaps the
crews of the aforesaid ships have been benumbed into idleness by the
touch of a torpedo, by which the right hand of him who attacks it is so
deadened--even through the spear by which it is itself wounded--that
while still part of a living body it hangs down benumbed without sense
or motion. I think some such misfortunes must have happened to men who
are unable to move themselves.

"But no. The sucking-fish of these men is their hindering corruption.
The shell-fishes that bite them are their avaricious hearts. The torpedo
that benumbs them is lying guile. With perverted ingenuity they
manufacture delays, that they may seem to have met with a run of
ill-luck.

"Let your Greatness, whom it especially behoves to take thought for such
matters, cause that this be put right by speediest rebuke: lest the
famine, which will otherwise ensue, be deemed to be the child of
negligence rather than of the barrenness of the land".

The occasion of the second letter (Var., x., 30.) was as follows. Some
brazen images of elephants which adorned the Sacred Street of Rome were
falling into ruin, Cassiodorus, writing in the name of one of
Theodoric's successors, to the Prefect of the City, orders that their
gaping limbs should be strengthened by hooks, and their pendulous
bellies should be supported by masonry. He then proceeds to give to the
admiring Prefect some wonderful information as to the natural history
of the elephant. He regrets that the metal effigies should be so soon
destroyed, when the animal which they represent is accustomed to live
more than a thousand years.

"The living elephant" he says, "when it is once prostrate on the ground,
cannot rise unaided, because it has no joints in its feet. Hence when
they are helping men to fell timber, you see numbers of them lying on
the earth till men come and help them to rise. he tiny sits in the
before the fire lost in dismal thought Mr. TREE is excellent, finish
of the Second enactment, when, without a word, except in too noisy. very
best thing he does is the ultra-melodramatic parts, where he is the
perfect.It uses
its proboscis, that nose-like hand which Nature has given it in
compensation for its very short neck, for the benefit of its master,
accepting the presents which will be profitable to him. It always walks
cautiously, remembering that fatal fall into the hunter's pit which was
the beginning of its captivity. When requested to do so, it exhales its
breath, which is said to be a remedy for the headache.

"When it comes to water, it sucks up a vast quantity in its trunk, and
then at the word of command squirts it forth like a shower. If any one
have treated its demands with contempt, it pours forth such a stream of
dirty water over him that one would think that a river had entered his
house. For this beast has a wonderfully long memory, both of injury and
of kindness. Its eyes are small but move solemnly, so that there is a
sort of royal majesty in its appearance: and it despises scurrile jests,
while it always looks with pleasure on that which is honourable".

It must be admitted that if the official communications of modern
statesmen thus anxiously combined amusement with instruction, the dull
routine of "I have the honour to inform" and "I beg to remain your
obedient humble servant", would acquire a charm of which it is now
destitute.

I have translated two letters which show the ludicrous side of the
literary character of Cassiodorus. In justice to this honest, if
somewhat pedantic, servant of Theodoric, I will close this sketch of his
character with a state-paper of a better type, and one which
incidentally throws some light on the social condition of Italy under
the Goths.

"THEODORIC to the Illustrious Neudes. (Var., v., 29.)

All Spain, except its north-western corner, and something
like half of Gaul--namely, that region which is contained between the
Pyrenees and the Loire, owns the sway of the young king, whose capital
city is Toulouse, and who, though a stranger in blood, bears the name
of the great Visigoth who first battered a breach in the walls of Rome,
the mighty Alaric. This Alaric II. (485-507), the son of Euric, who had
been the most powerful sovereign of his dynasty, inherited neither his
father's force of character (485-507) nor the bitterness of his
Arianism. The persecution of the Catholics was suspended, or ceased
altogether, and we may picture to ourselves the congregations again
wending their way by unblockaded paths to the house of prayer, the
churches once more roofed in and again made gorgeous by the stately
ceremonial of the Catholic rite. In other ways, too, Alaric showed
himself anxious to conciliate the favour of his Roman subjects. He
ordered an abstract of the Imperial Code to be prepared, and this
abstract, under the name of the _Breviarium Alaricianum_[92] is to this
day one of our most valuable sources of information as to Roman Law. He
is also said to have directed the construction of the canal, which still
bears his name _(Canal d'Alaric),_ and which, connecting the Adour with
the Aisne, assists the irrigation of the meadows of Gascony. But all
these attempts to close the feud between the king and his orthodox
subjects were vain. When the day of trial came, it was seen, as it had
long been suspected, that the sympathies and the powerful influence of
the bishops and clergy were thrown entirely on the side of the Catholic
invader.

[Footnote 92: Sometimes called the _Breviarium Aniani,_ from the name of
the Registrar whose signature attested each copy of the _Breviarium._]

Between the Visigothic and Ostrogothic courts there was firm friendship
and alliance, the remembrance of their common origin and of many perils
and hardships shared together on the shores of the Euxine and in the
passes of the Balkans being fortified by the knowledge of the dangers to
which their common profession of Arianism exposed them amidst the
Catholic population of the Empire. The alliance, which had served
Theodoric in good stead when the Visigoths helped him in his struggle
with Odovacar, was yet further strengthened by kinship, the young king
of Toulouse having received in marriage a princess from Ravenna, whose
name is variously given as Arevagni or Ostrogotho.

A matrimonial alliance also connected Theodoric with the king of the
_Burgundians_. These invaders, who were destined so strangely to
disappear out of history themselves, while giving their name to such
wide and rich regions of mediæval Europe, occupied at this time the
valleys of the Saone and the Rhone, as well as the country which we now
call Switzerland. Their king, Gundobad, a man somewhat older than
Theodoric, had once interfered zealously in the politics of Italy,
making and unmaking Emperors and striking for Odovacar against his
Ostrogothic rival. ."[62] This task is the responsibility of the party.
Although it has become the only political party in Germany, the party
does not desire to identify itself with the state. It does not wish to
dominate the state or to serve it. It works beside it and cooperates
with it. In this respect, Nazi Germany is distinguished from the
other one-party states of Europe: "In the one-party state of Russia, the
party rules over the state; in the one-party state of Italy, the party
serves the state; but in the one-party state of Germany, the party
neither serves the state nor rules over it directly but works and
struggles together with it for the community of the people

."[63] Neesse contends that the party derives its legal basis from
the law inherent in the living organism of the German _Volk_:

The inner law of the NSDAP is none other than the inner law of the
German people. The party arises from the people; it has formed an
organization which crystallizes about itself the feelings of the people,
which seemed buried, and the strength of the people, which seemed
lost.[64]
Neesse states that the party has two great tasks--to insure the
continuity of national leadership and to preserve the unity of the
_Volk_:
The first main task of the party, which is in keeping with its
organic nature, is to protect the National Socialist idea and to
constantly renew it by drawing from the depths of the German soul,
to keep it pure and clear, and to pass it on thus to coming
generations: this is predominantly a matter of education of the
people.

The second great task, which is in keeping with its organizational nature,
is to form the people and the state into the unity of the nation
and to create for the German national community forms which are ever
new and suited to its vital development: this is predominantly a matter
of state formation. These two tasks, one of which deals with substance
and the other with function, belong together. It is as impossible to
separate them as it is to split up the party into organism and
organization, form and content.[65]
Huber (document 1, _post_ p. 155) describes the tasks of the party
in similar terms. He states that the party is charged with the
"education of the people to a political people" through the awakening
of the political consciousness of each individual; the inculcation
of a "uniform political philosophy," that is, the teaching of Nazi
principles; "the selection of leaders," including the choice and
training of especially promising boys to be the Führers of the
future; and the shaping of the "political will of the people" in
accordance with the Führer's aims.[66]
The educational tasks of the party are stressed by Beck, who develops
the idea that the _Volk_ can be divided into three main groups, "a
supporting, a leading, and a creative class

."[67] It is the duty of the leading class, that is, the party, from
which the creative class of leaders is drawn, to provide for the education
of the supporting class.

Every member of the body of the people must belong to the politically
supporting class, that is, each one who bears within himself the
basic racial, spiritual, and mental values of the people ... Here no
sort of leading or creative activity is demanded but only a
recognition of the leading and creative will ...

Only those are called to leadership in political life who have
recognized the community-bound law of all human life in purest clarity
and in the all-embracing extent of its validity and who will place
all the powers of their personal lives with the help of a politically
moral character in the service of the formation of community life ...
From the politically leading class arise the politically creative
personalities. These are the mysterious elemental forces which are
beyond all explanation by human reason and which through their action
and by means of the living idea within them give to the community of the
people an expression which is fresh, young, and eternal. Here is the
fulfilment of the highest and purest political humanity ...
The education of the socialist personality is essentially the forming
of the politically supporting class within the German people and the
encouragement of those political tendencies which make a man a political
leader. To educate to political creativeness is just as impossible
as to educate to genius.

Education can only furnish the spiritual atmosphere, can only prepare
the spiritual living-space for the politically creative personality by
forming a uniform political consciousness in the socialistic personality,
and in the development of politically creative personalities it can at
the most give special attention to those values of character and spirit
which are of decisive importance for the development of this
personality.[68]
Goebbels in _The Nature and Form of National Socialism_ (document 2, _post_
p. 170) emphasizes the responsibility of the party for the leadership
of the state:

The party must always continue to represent the hierarchy of National
Socialist leadership. This minority must always insist upon its prerogative
to control the state. It must keep the way open for the German youth
which wishes to take its place in this hierarchy. In reality the
hierarchy has fewer rights than duties!

It is responsible for the leadership of the state and it solemnly
relieves the people of this responsibility.

It has the duty to control the state in the best interests and to
the general welfare of the nation.[69]
Dr. Frick, German Minister of the Interior, in his chapter in _Germany
Speaks_ indicates the exclusive position of the party in the Third
Reich:

National Socialist Germany, however, is not merely a unitary state: it
is also a unitary nation and its governance is based on the principle
of leadership ...

In National Socialist Germany, leadership is in the hands of an organized
community, the National Socialist Party; and as the latter represents
the will of the nation, the policy adopted by it in harmony with the
vital interests of the nation is at the same time the policy adopted
by the country ... The National Socialist Party is the only political
party in Germany and therefore the true representative of the people
...[70]
To Dr. Ley, the party is identical with the Führer. As he wrote in the
_Angriff_ on April 9, 1942 (document 6, _post_ p. 184), "The National
Socialist Party is Hitler, and Hitler is the party."
The role of the party in legislation, in political matters, and in the
appointment of Government officials is indicated by the Führer's decree
of May 29, 1941,[71] as amplified by the order of January 16, 1942,
concerning its execution.[72] (Document 9, _post_ p. 212). This order
provides that all legislative proposals and proposed laws and
decrees, as well as any proposed changes therein, must pass through
and receive the approval of the Party Chancelry

.

_2. Party Membership_
Details concerning the qualifications and duties of party members are
contained in the _Party Organization Book_ for 1940 (document 7, _post_
p. 186).

Membership is finally confirmed by the issuance of a membership card or a
membership book. Anyone who becomes a party member does not merely join
an organization but he becomes a soldier in the German freedom movement
and that means much more than just paying his dues and attending the
members' meetings. He obligates himself to subordinate his own ego and
to place everything he has in the service of the people's cause. Only
he who is capable of doing this should become a party member. A selection
must be made in accordance with this idea.

Readiness to fight, readiness to sacrifice, and strength of character
are the requirements for a good National Socialist. Small blemishes,
such as a false step which someone has made in his youth, should be
overlooked; the contribution in the struggle for Germany should alone be
decisive. The healthy will naturally prevail over the bad if the will
to health finds sufficient support in leadership and achievement.
Admission to the party should not be controlled by the old bourgeois
point of view. The party must always represent the elite of the
people.[73]
German blood is one of the prerequisites for party membership. The _Party
Organization Book_ for 1940 (document 7, _post_ p. 186) also states,
"Only those racial comrades who possess German citizenship are
eligible for admission."[74]

Party members shall not exceed ten per cent of the German population
of the region. "The ideal proportion of the number of party members to
the number of racial comrades is set at ten per cent. This proportion is
to apply also to the individual Province [Gau]."[75]

_3. Pledges and Symbols of Allegiance_
Party members take an oath of loyalty to the Führer in the following
terms: "I pledge allegiance to my Führer, Adolf Hitler. I promise at
all times to respect and obey him and the leaders whom he appoints over
me."[76]

(a) The Hitler Salute
A pledge of allegiance to the Führer is also implied in the Nazi
salute, which is usually accompanied by the greeting, "Heil Hitler." The
phrase _mit deutschen Gruss_, which is commonly used as a closing
salutation in letters, is another form of the Hitler greeting.
_Knaurs Konversations-Lexikon_ (_Knaur's Conversational Dictionary_),
published in Berlin in 1934, contains the following definition:

_German greeting_, Hitler greeting: by raising the right arm; used
by the old Germans with the spear as a greeting of arms _[Waffengruss]._
Communal greeting of the National Socialists; introduced into general
use in 1933.

That this greeting was used by the Nazis as early as 1923 is demonstrated
by a photograph which appeared in _Das Buch der NSDAP, Werden, Kampf and
Ziel der NSDAP_ (_The Book of the NSDAP, Growth, Struggle, and Goal of
the NSDAP_) by Walter M. Espe (Berlin, 1934), illustration 34 (document
10, _post_ p. 214).

In the same book (page 23 in the supplement entitled "_Die NSDAP_")
the following distinction is made between the usual Nazi greeting and
the Storm Troopers' salute:
While the German greeting consists merely in raising the right hand
in any desired manner and represents rather a general comradely
greeting, the SA salute is executed, in accordance with the
specifications of the SA service regulations, by placing the left
hand on the belt and raising the extended right arm.

The SA salute is to be given to all higher ranking leaders of the SA
and the SS and of the veterans' organization which has been incorporated
into the SA, as well as to the Army and the national and security
police forces.

The comradely German greeting is to be exchanged between all equally ranking
members of the SA and the SS and members of a corresponding rank in the
Army, the police, the veterans' organization, the German air-sport
league, the Hitler Youth, the railway guards, and the whole membership
of the party so far as they are distinguishable by regulation uniforms.

(b) The Swastika
Early in its history the Nazi Party adopted the swastika banner as its
official emblem.[77] It was designed by Hitler himself, who wrote in
_Mein Kampf_:

I myself after countless attempts had laid down a final form: a flag with
a background of red cloth, having a white circle, and, in its center, a
black swastika....

As National Socialists we see our program in our flag. In the _red_ we see
the social idea of the movement, in the _white_ the nationalistic
idea, and in the _swastika_ the fight for the victory of Aryan man and
at the same time for the victory of the idea of creative work, which
in itself always was and always will be anti-Semitic.[78]
The swastika banner came into general use after January 30, 1933 as
a symbol of allegiance to the Hitler regime, but not until two years
later was it made the German national flag by the Reich flag law of
September 15, 1935.[79] Another law, decreed on April 7, 1937,[80]
specified that:

The insignia which the NSDAP, its formations, and associated organizations
use for their officers, their structure, their organization, and their
symbols may not be used by other associations either alone or with
embellishments.

It is interesting to note that party regulations forbid members to use
passport photographs in which they appear in party uniform or
wearing party insignia and that party members are forbidden to
discuss foreign policy with foreigners unless they are officially
designated by the Führer to do so.

The pertinent regulations read:

_Pass Photos on Identification Cards_
Members of the NSDAP must not use pass photos which show the holder of
any identification card in a uniform of the party or of any of its
formations. It is also forbidden to use as pass photos pictures which
show the person wearing a party button.

* * * * *
_Conversations With Foreigners_
It is forbidden to all party members to engage in discussions of
foreign policy with foreigners. Only such persons as have been designated
by the Führer are entitled to do so.[81]

The Totalitarian State
The Weimar Constitution, although never formally abrogated by the
Nazis, was rendered totally ineffectual by two basic laws, promulgated
within two months after the seizure of power by the party.

The first of these was the "Decree of the Reich's President for the
Protection of the People and State" (document 11-I, _post_ p.
215), issued February 28, 1933, the day after the Reichstag was burned
down. It suspended "until further notice"[82] articles of the Weimar
Constitution guaranteeing essential democratic rights of the individual.
Thus, according to article I of this decree, "restrictions on
personal liberty, on the right of free expression of opinion, including
freedom of the press, on the right of assembly and the right of association,
and violations of the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and
telephonic communications, and warrants for house-searches, orders
for confiscations as well as restrictions on property, are also
permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed

."[83] The abrogation by the Nazis of these fundamental rights of
democracy has never been repealed or amended. In fact, this decree
represents the presupposition and confirmation of the police sway
established throughout Germany by the Nazis.[84]
The second basic law, known as the "Enabling Act," the "Law To
Remove the Distress of People and State," of March 24, 1933 (document
11-II, _post_ p. 217), swept away parliamentary government entirely.

By abrogating the pertinent articles of the Weimar Constitution,
it enabled the Nazi Cabinet under Hitler's chancelorship to appropriate
money and legislate without any responsibility to the Reichstag or any
obligation to respect the Constitution.

The dissolution of democracy in Germany was sealed by the unification
of the authoritarian Nazi Party with the German state. Soon after the
party came to power in 1933, steps were taken to effect and secure this
unity. The process is described by Huber (document 1, _post_ p.
155) as follows:

On July 14, 1933 was issued the law against the formation of new parties
which raised the NSDAP to the only political party in Germany [document
11-III] ... The overthrow of the old party-state was accompanied by the
construction of the new movement-state [_Bewegungsstaat_]. Out of a
political fighting organization the NSDAP grew to a community
capable of carrying the state and the nation. This process was accomplished
step by step in the first months after the National Socialist seizure
of power. The assumption of the office of Chancelor by the Führer
of the movement formed the basis for this development. Various party
leaders were appointed as _Reichsminister_; the governors of the provinces
were national leaders or _Gauleiter_ of the party, such as General
von Epp; the Prussian government officials are as a rule _Gauleiter_ of
the party; the Prussian police chiefs are mostly high-ranking SA
leaders. By this system of a union of the personnel of the party and
state offices the unity of party and state was achieved.[85]
The culmination of this development was reached in the "Law To Safeguard
the Unity of Party and State," of December 1, 1933 (document 11-IV,
_post_ p. 221), which proclaimed the NSDAP "the bearer of the German
state-idea and indissolubly joined to the state." In order to guarantee
the complete cooperation of the party and SA with the public officials,
the Führer's Deputy and the Chief of Staff of the SA were made
members of the Cabinet.

With regard to the relation between the party and the state, Neesse
writes:
The NSDAP is not a structure which stands under direct state control,
to which single tasks of public administration are entrusted by the
state, but it holds and maintains is claim to totality as the "bearer
of the German state-idea" in all fields relating to the
community--regardless of how various single functions are divided
between the organization of the party and the organization of the
state.[86]
To maintain cooperation between the party and state organizations,
the highest state offices are given to the men holding the corresponding
party offices.

Gauweiler (document 8, _post_ p. 204) attributes to the party supreme
leadership in all phases of national life.

Thus the state becomes merely an administrative machine which the
party has set up in accordance with and for the accomplishment of
its aims:
As the responsible bearer and shaper of the destiny of the whole
German nation the party has created an entirely new state, for that
which sought to foist itself upon her as a state was simply the
product of a deep human confusion.

The state of the past and its political ideal had never satisfied the
longing of the German people. The National Socialist movement already
carried its state within itself at the time of its early struggles. It
was able to place the completely formed body of its own state at the
disposal of the state which it had taken over.[87]
The official party interpretation of the relation between party and state,
as set forth in the _Party Organization Book_ for 1940, appears in the
Appendix as document 7 (_post_ p. 186).

Goebbels in his lecture on _The Nature and Form of National Socialism_
(document 2, _post_ p. 170) stressed the importance of _Gleichschaltung_
or the penetration of Nazi ideology into all fields of national life.
This to his mind must be the result of the National Socialist revolution.
The same aims, ideals, and standards must be applied to economics and to
politics, to cultural and social development, to education and
religion, and to foreign and domestic relations.

The result of this concept of the totalitarian state has been the compulsory
regimentation of all phases of German life to conform to the pattern
established by the party. The totalitarian state does not recognize
personal liberties for the individual. The legal position of the
individual citizen in the Third Reich is clearly set forth by Huber
(document 1, _post_ p. 155):

Not until the nationalistic political philosophy had become dominant
could the liberalistic idea of basic rights be really overcome.

The concept of personal liberties of the individual as opposed to
the authority of the state had to disappear; it is not to be reconciled
with the principle of the nationalistic Reich. There are no personal
liberties of the individual which fall outside of the realm of the state
and which must be respected by the state. The member of the people,
organically connected with the whole community, has replaced the
isolated individual; he is included in the totality of the political
people and is drawn into the collective action. There can no longer be
any question of a private sphere, free of state influence, which is
sacred and untouchable before the political unity. The constitution of
the nationalistic Reich is therefore not based upon a system of
inborn and inalienable rights of the individual.[88]
In place of these rights the constitution of the Third Reich
guarantees to the individual his place in the community of the
people:
The legal position of the individual member of the people forms an
entirely new concept which is indispensable for the construction
of a nationalistic order.

The legal position of the individual is always related to the community
and conditioned by duty. It is developed not for the sake of the individual
but for the community, which can only be filled with life, power,
and purpose when a suitable field of action is insured for the
individual member.

[Footnote 101: There is some difficulty in understanding this remark
about the relative ages of the sovereigns If we put the date of the
letters at 506 (and a later date is hardly possible, nor one more than
two or three years earlier), though Gundobad might well be over sixty,
Theodoric himself could be only fifty-two, while on the other hand the
"regii juvenes", Clovis and Alaric, were about forty. But _senex_ and
_juvenis_ are expressions often used with no great exactness; and I
conjecture that the cares and struggles of Theodoric's early manhood had
made him an old man before his time.]

The diplomatic action of Theodoric was powerless to avert the war;
possibly even it may have stimulated Clovis to strike rapidly before a
hostile coalition could be formed against him.

At an assembly of his nation (perhaps the "Camp of March") in the early
part of 507, he impetuously declared: "I take it grievously amiss that
these Arians should hold so large a part of Gaul. Let us go and overcome
them with God's help, and bring the land into subjection to us". The
saying pleased the whole multitude, and the collected army inarched
southward to the Loire. On their way they passed through the territory
owned by the monastery of St. Martin of Tours, the greatest saint of
Gaul. Here the king commanded them to abstain religiously from all
depredations, taking only grass for their horses, and water from the
streams. One of the soldiers, finding a quantity of hay in the
possession of a peasant, took it from him, arguing that hay was grass,
and so came within the permitted exception. He was, however, at once cut
down with a sword, the king exclaiming. "What hope shall we have of
victory if we offend the blessed Martin?" Having first prayed for a
sign, Clovis sent his messengers with gifts to the great basilica of
Tours, and behold! when these messengers set foot in the sacred
building, the choristers were singing an antiphon, taken from the 18th
Psalm: "Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle, thou hast
subdued under me those that rose up against me".

Meanwhile, Alaric, taken at unawares, short of men and short of money,
was endeavouring to remedy the latter deficiency by a depreciation of
the currency. To swell his slender battalions he evidently looked to his
father-in-law, Theodoric, whose peace-making letter had ended with these
words: "We look upon your enemy as the common enemy of all. Whoever
strives against you will rightly have to deal with me, as a foe". Yet
notwithstanding this assurance, no Ostrogothic troops came at this time
to the help of the Visigoths. In the great dearth of historical
material, our account of these transactions has to be made up from
scattered and fragmentary notices, which do not enable us to explain
this strange inaction of so true-hearted an ally. It is not imputed to
him as a fault by any contemporary authority, and it seems reasonable to
suppose that not the will, but the power, to help his menaced son-in-law
was wanting. One alarming change in the situation had revealed itself
since Theodoric ordered his secretary to write the letters recommending
an anti-Frankish confederacy of kings. Gundobad the Burgundian was now
the declared ally of Clovis, and promised himself a share of the spoil.
So powerful an enemy on the flank, threatening the communications of the
two Gothic states, may very probably have been the reason why no timely
succour was sent from Ravenna to Toulouse.

Clovis and his Frankish host, hungering for the spoil, pressed forwards,
and succeeded, apparently without opposition, in crossing the broad
river Loire. Alaric had taken up a strong position at the Campus
Vogladensis (_Vouillé: dep. Vienne_), about ten miles from Poitiers.
Here he wished to remain on the defensive till the expected succours
from Theodoric could arrive, but his soldiers, confident in their power
to beat the Franks unassisted, began to revile their king's over-caution
and his father-in-law's delay, and forced Alaric to fight.[102] The
Goths began hurling their missile weapons, but the daring Franks rushed
in upon them and commenced a hand-to-hand encounter, in which they were
completely victorious. The Goths turned to flee, and Clovis, riding up
to where Alaric was fighting, slew him with his own hand. He himself had
immediately afterwards a narrow escape from two of the enemy, who,
coming suddenly upon him, thrust their long spears at him, one on each
side. The strength of his coat of mail, however, and the speed of his
horse saved him from a disaster which might possibly even then have
turned the tide of victory.

[Footnote 102: This statement as to the battle being forced on, contrary
to the wishes of Alaric, rests only on the authority of Procopius, not a
contemporary author, and not very well informed as to the events of this
campaign.]

The result of this battle was the complete overthrow of the Visigothic
kingdom of Toulouse. In a certain sense it survived, and for two
centuries played a great part in Europe as the Spanish kingdom of
Toledo, but, as competitors for dominion in Gaul, the Visigoths
henceforward disappear from history. To liberate Italy, which was in his
day "enslaved, torn and pillaged," and to make her more powerful,
he would use any means, for to his mind the holiness of the end
justified them completely. In this he was sharply rebuked by foreigners
who were not as hostile to his means as they were fearful of the end which
he propounded. He advocated therefore the constitution of a strong Italian
state, supported by the sacrifices and by the blood of the citizens, not
defended by mercenary troops; well-ordered internally, aggressive and
bent on expansion.

"Weak republics," he said, "have no determination and can never reach
a decision." (Disc. I. c. 38). "Weak states were ever dubious in
choosing their course, and slow deliberations are always harmful." (Disc.
I. c. 10). And again: "Whoso undertakes to govern a multitude either
in a régime of liberty or in a monarchy, without previously making
sure of those who are hostile to the new order of things builds a
short-lived state." (Disc. I. c. 16).

And further on "the dictatorial authority helped and did not harm the
Roman republic" (Disc. I. c. 34), and "Kings and republics lacking
in national troops both for offense and defense should be ashamed of
their existence." (Disc. I. c. 21). And again: "Money not only
does not protect you but rather it exposes you to plundering assaults.
Nor can there be a more false opinion than that which says that
money is the sinews of war. Not money but good soldiers win battles."
(Disc. I.
II. c. 10). "The country must be defended with ignominy or with glory
and in either way it is nobly defended." (Disc. III. c. 41). "And
with dash and boldness people often capture what they never would have
obtained by ordinary means." (Disc. III. c. 44). Machiavelli was not
only a great political authority, he taught the mastery of energy and
will. Fascism learns from him not only its doctrines but its action as
well.

Different from Machiavelli's, in mental attitude, in cultural preparation,
and in manner of presentation, G.B. Vico must yet be connected with the
great Florentine from whom in a certain way he seems to proceed. In
the heyday of "natural law" Vico is decidedly opposed to _ius naturale_
and in his attacks against its advocates, Grotius, Seldenus and Pufendorf,
he systematically assails the abstract, rationalistic, and utilitarian
principles of the XVIII century. As Montemayor justly says:[4] "While
the 'natural jurists', basing justice and state on utility and interest
and grounding human certitude on reason, were striving to draft permanent
codes and construct the perfect state, Vico strongly asserted the
social nature of man, the ethical character of the juridical
consciousness and its growth through the history of humanity rather
than in sacred history.

Vico therefore maintains that doctrines must begin with those subjects
which take up and explain the entire course of civilization.
Experience and not ratiocination, history and not reason must help human
wisdom to understand the civil and political regimes which were the
result not of reason or philosophy, but rather of common sense, or if
you will of the social consciousness of man" and farther on (pages 373-374),
"to Vico we owe the conception of history in its fullest sense as
magistra vitae, the search after the humanity of history, the principle
which makes the truth progress with time, the discovery of the political
'course' of nations. It is Vico who uttered the eulogy of the patrician
'heroic hearts' of the 'patres patriae' first founders of states,
magnanimous defenders of the commonwealth and wise counsellors of
politics. To Vico we owe the criticism of democracies, the affirmation
of their brief existence, of their rapid disintegration at the hands of
factions and demagogues, of their lapse first into anarchy, then into
monarchy, when their degradation does not make them a prey of foreign
oppressors. Vico conceived of civil liberty as subjection to law, as
just subordination, of the private to the public interests, to the sway
of the state. It was Vico who sketched modern society as a world
of nations each one guarding its own imperium, fighting just and not
inhuman wars. In Vico therefore we find the condemnation of pacifism,
the assertion that right is actualized by bodily force, that without
force, right is of no avail, and that therefore 'qui ab iniuriis se tueri
non potest servus est.'"
It is not difficult to discern the analogies between these affirmations
and the fundamental views and the spirit of Fascism. Nor should we marvel
at this similarity. Fascism, a strictly Italian phenomenon, has its
roots in the Risorgimento and the Risorgimento was influenced undoubtedly
by Vico.

It would be inexact to affirm that the philosophy of Vico dominated
the Risorgimento. Too many elements of German, French, and English
civilizations had been added to our culture during the first half of
the XIX century to make this possible, so much so that perhaps Vico
might have remained unknown to the makers of Italian unity
if another powerful mind from Southern Italy, Vincenzo Cuoco, had
not taken it upon himself to expound the philosophy of Vico in those
very days in which the intellectual preparation of the Risorgimento
was being carried on.

An adequate account of Cuoco's doctrines would carry me too far.
Montemayor, in the article quoted above, gives them considerable attention.
He quotes among other things Cuoco's arraignment of Democracy: "Italy
has fared badly at the hand of Democracy which has withered to their roots
the three sacred plants of liberty, unity, and independence.
If we wish to see these trees flourish again let us protect them in
the future from Democracy."
The influence of Cuoco, an exile at Milan, exerted through his writings,
his newspaper articles, and Vichian propaganda, on the Italian patriots
is universally recognized. Among the regular readers of his
_Giornale Italiano_ we find Monti and Foscolo. Clippings of his articles
were treasured by Mazzini and Manzoni, who often acted as his secretary,
called him his "master in politics."[5]
The influence of the Italian tradition summed up and handed down by
Cuoco was felt by Mazzini whose interpretation of the function of
the citizen as duty and mission is to be connected with Vico's
doctrine rather than with the philosophic and political doctrines
of the French Revolution.

"Training for social duty," said Mazzini, "is essentially and
logically unitarian.

Life for it is but a duty, a mission. The norm and definition
of such mission can only be found in a collective term superior to
all the individuals of the country--in the people, in the nation. If
there is a collective mission, a communion of duty ... it can only be
represented in the national unity."[6] And farther on:
"The declaration of rights, which all constitutions insist in copying
slavishly from the French, express only those of the period ... which
considered the individual as the end and pointed out only one half
of the problem" and again, "assume the existence of one of those
crises that threaten the life of the nation, and demand the active
sacrifice of all its sons ... will you ask the citizens to face
martyrdom in virtue of their rights?

You have taught men that society was solely constituted to guarantee
their rights and now you ask them to sacrifice one and all, to
suffer and die for the safety of the 'nation?'"

[7]

                             In Mazzini's conception of the citizen as instrument for the
attainment of the nation's ends and therefore submissive to a higher
mission, to the duty of supreme sacrifice, we see the anticipation
of one of the fundamental points of the Fascist doctrine.

                             Unfortunately, the autonomy of the political thought of Italy,
vigorously established in the works of Vico, nobly reclaimed by
Vincenzo Cuoco, kept up during the struggles of the Risorgimento
in spite of the many foreign influences of that period, seemed to
exhaust itself immediately after the unification.

Italian political thought which had been original in times of servitude,
became enslaved in the days of freedom.

A powerful innovating movement, issuing from the war and of which Fascism
is the purest expression, was to restore Italian thought in
the sphere of political doctrine to its own traditions which are
the traditions of Rome.

This task of intellectual liberation, now slowly being accomplished,
is no less important than the political deliverance brought about by the
Fascist Revolution. It is a great task which continues and integrates the
Risorgimento; it is now bringing to an end, after the cessation of our
political servitude, the intellectual dependence of Italy.

Thanks to it, Italy again speaks to the world and the world listens
to Italy. It is a great task and a great deed and it demands great
efforts. To carry it through, we must, each one of us, free ourselves
of the dross of ideas and mental habits which two centuries of
foreign intellectualistic tradition have heaped upon us; we must
not only take on a new culture but create for ourselves a new soul.

We must methodically and patiently contribute something towards the organic
and complete elaboration of our doctrine, at the same time supporting it
both at home and abroad with untiring devotion. We ask this effort
of renovation and collaboration of all Fascists, as well as of all
who feel themselves to be Italians. After the hour of sacrifice comes
the hour of unyielding efforts. To our work, then, fellow countrymen,
for the glory of Italy!

THE PHILOSOPHIC BASIS OF FASCISM BY GIOVANNI GENTILE

For the Italian nation the World War was the solution of a deep spiritual
crisis. They willed and fought it long before they felt and evaluated
it. But they willed, fought, felt and evaluated it in a certain
spirit which Italy's generals and statesmen exploited, but which
also worked on them, conditioning their policies and their action. The
spirit in question was not altogether clear and self-consistent.
That it lacked unanimity was particularly apparent just before and
again just after the war when feelings were not subject to war discipline.
It was as though the Italian character were crossed by two different
currents which divided it into two irreconcilable sections. One need
think only of the days of Italian neutrality and of the debates
that raged between Interventionists and Neutralists.

The ease with which the most inconsistent ideas were pressed into
service by both parties showed that the issue was not between two opposing
political opinions, two conflicting concepts of history, but actually
between two different temperaments, two different souls.

For one kind of person the important point was to fight the war, either
on the side of Germany or against Germany: but in either event to
fight the war, without regard to specific advantages--to fight the war
in order that at last the Italian nation, created rather by favoring
conditions than by the will of its people to be a nation, might receive
its test in blood, such a test as only war can bring by uniting all
citizens in a single thought, a single passion, a single hope,
emphasizing to each individual that all have something in common,
something transcending private interests.

This was the very thing that frightened the other kind of person, the
prudent man, the realist, who had a clear view of the mortal risks a
young, inexperienced, badly prepared nation would be running in such a
war, and who also saw--a most significant point--that, all things considered,
a bargaining neutrality would surely win the country tangible rewards,
as great as victorious participation itself.

The point at issue was just that: the Italian Neutralists stood for
material advantages, advantages tangible, ponderable, palpable;
the Interventionists stood for moral advantages, intangible,
impalpable, imponderable--imponderable at least on the scales used
by their antagonists.

On the eve of the war these two Italian characters stood facing
each other, scowling and irreconcilable--the one on the aggressive,
asserting itself ever more forcefully through the various organs
of public opinion; the other on the defensive, offering resistance
through the Parliament which in those days still seemed to be the
basic repository of State sovereignty.

Civil conflict seemed inevitable in Italy, and civil war was in fact
averted only because the King took advantage of one of his prerogatives
and declared war against the Central Powers.

This act of the King was the first decisive step toward the solution
of the crisis.

II
The crisis had ancient origins. Its roots sank deep into the inner
spirit of the Italian people.

What were the creative forces of the _Risorgimento_? The "Italian
people," to which some historians are now tending to attribute an
important if not a decisive role in our struggle for national unity
and independence, was hardly on the scene at all.

The active agency was always an idea become a person--it was one or
several determined wills which were fixed on determined goals. There
can be no question that the birth of modern Italy was the work of the
few. And it could not be otherwise.

It is always the few who represent the self-consciousness and the
will of an epoch and determine what its history shall be; for it is
they who see the forces at their disposal and through those forces
actuate the one truly active and productive force--their own will.

That will we find in the song of the poets and the ideas of the
political writers, who know how to use a language harmonious with a
universal sentiment or with a sentiment capable of becoming
universal.

In the case of Italy, in all our bards, philosophers and leaders, from
Alfieri to Foscolo, from Leopardi to Manzoni, from Mazzini to
Gioberti, we are able to pick up the threads of a new fabric, which is
a new kind of thought, a new kind of soul, a new kind of Italy. This
new Italy differed from the old Italy in something that was very simple
but yet was of the greatest importance: this new Italy took life seriously,
while the old one did not. People in every age had dreamed of an
Italy and talked of an Italy. The notion of Italy had been sung in all
kinds of music, propounded in all kinds of philosophy. But it was
always an Italy that existed in the brain of some scholar whose learning
was more or less divorced from reality.
Now reality demands that convictions be taken seriously, that ideas become
actions. Accordingly it was necessary that this Italy, which was an
affair of brains only, become also an affair of hearts, become, that
is, something serious, something alive. This, and no other, was the meaning
of Mazzini's great slogan: "Thought and Action." It was the essence
of the great revolution which he preached and which he accomplished
by instilling his doctrine into the hearts of others. Not many
others--a small minority! But they were numerous enough and powerful
enough to raise the question where it could be answered--in Italian
public opinion (taken in conjunction with the political situation
prevailing in the rest of Europe). They were able to establish the
doctrine that life is not a game, but a mission; that, therefore, the
individual has a law and a purpose in obedience to which and in fulfillment
of which he alone attains his true value; that, accordingly, he must
make sacrifices, now of personal comfort, now of private interest, now
of life itself.

No revolution ever possessed more markedly than did the Italian
_Risorgimento_ this characteristic of ideality, of thought preceding
action. Our revolt was not concerned with the material needs of life,
nor did it spring from elementary and widely diffused sentiments breaking
out in popular uprisings and mass disturbances. The movements of 1847
and 1848 were demonstrations, as we would say today, of "intellectuals";
they were efforts toward a goal on the part of a minority of patriots
who were standard bearers of an ideal and were driving governments
and peoples toward its attainment.

Idealism--understood as faith in the advent of an ideal reality,
as a manner of conceiving life not as fixed within the limits of
existing fact, but as incessant progress and transformation toward
the level of a higher law which controls men with the very force
of the idea--was the sum and substance of Mazzini's teaching; and
it supplied the most conspicuous characteristic of our great Italian
revolution.

In this sense all the patriots who worked for the foundation of the
new kingdom were Mazzinians--Gioberti, Cavour, Victor Emmanuel,
Garibaldi. To be sure, our writers of the first rank, such as Manzoni
and Rosmini, had no historical connection with Mazzini; but they had
the same general tendency as Mazzini. Working along diverging lines,
they all came together on the essential point: that true life is not the
life which is, but also the life which ought to be. It was a conviction
essentially religious in character, essentially anti-materialistic.

III
This religious and idealistic manner of looking at life, so characteristic
of the _Risorgimento_, prevails even beyond the heroic age of the
revolution and the establishment of the Kingdom. It survives down through
Ricasoli, Lanza, Sella and Minghetti, down, that is, to the
occupation of Rome and the systemization of our national finances. The
parliamentary overturn of 1876, indeed, marks not the end, but rather an
interruption, on the road that Italy had been following since the beginning
of the century. The outlook then changed, and not by the capriciousness
or weakness of men, but by a necessity of history which it would be
idiotic in our day to deplore.
At that time the fall of the Right, which had ruled continuously between
1861 and 1876, seemed to most people the real conquest of freedom.

To be sure the Right cannot be accused of too great scruple in respecting
the liberties guaranteed by our Constitution; but the real truth was that
the Right conceived liberty in a sense directly opposite to the
notions of the Left.

The Left moved from the individual to the State: the Right moved from
the State to the individual. The men of the left thought of "the people"
as merely the agglomerate of the citizens composing it. They therefore
made the individual the center and the point of departure of all the
rights and prerogatives which a régime of freedom was bound to respect.

The men of the Right, on the contrary, were firmly set in the notion
that no freedom can be conceived except within the State, that freedom
can have no important content apart from a solid régime of law
indisputably sovereign over the activities and the interests of
individuals. For the Right there could be no individual freedom not
reconcilable with the authority of the State.

In their eyes the general interest was always paramount over private
interests. The law, therefore, should have absolute efficacy and embrace
the whole life of the people.

This conception of the Right was evidently sound; but it involved great
dangers when applied without regard to the motives which provoked it.
Unless we are careful, too much law leads to stasis and therefore to the
annihilation of the life which it is the State's function to regulate
but which the State cannot suppress. The State may easily become a form
indifferent to its content--something extraneous to the substance
it would regulate.

If the law comes upon the individual from without, if the individual is
not absorbed in the life of the State, the individual feels
the law and the State as limitations on his activity, as chains which
will eventually strangle him unless he can break them down.

This was just the feeling of the men of '76. The country needed a
breath of air. Its moral, economic, and social forces demanded the
right to develop without interference from a law which took no account
of them. This was the historical reason for the overturn of
that year; and with the transference of power from Right to Left begins
the period of growth and development in our nation: economic
growth in industry, commerce, railroads, agriculture; intellectual
growth in science, education. The nation had received its form
from above. It had now to struggle to its new level, giving to a State
which already had its constitution, its administrative and
political organization, its army and its finance, a living content
of forces springing from individual initiative prompted by
interests which the _Risorgimento_, absorbed in its great ideals, had
either neglected or altogether disregarded.

The accomplishment of this constitutes the credit side of the balance
sheet of King Humbert I. It was the error of King Humbert's greatest
minister, Francesco Crispi, not to have understood his age. Crispi
strove vigorously to restore the authority and the prestige of the
State as against an individualism gone rampant, to reassert religious
ideals as against triumphant materialism.

He fell, therefore, before the assaults of so-called democracy.

Crispi was wrong. That was not the moment for re-hoisting the time-honored
banner of idealism. At that time there could be no talk of wars, of
national dignity, of competition with the Great Powers; no talk of
setting limits to personal liberties in the interests of the abstract
entity called "State." The word "God," which Crispi sometimes used, was
singularly out of place. It was a question rather of bringing
the popular classes to prosperity, self-consciousness, participation
in political life. Campaigns against illiteracy, all kinds of social
legislation, the elimination of the clergy from the public schools, which
must be secular and anti-clerical! During this period Freemasonry became
solidly established in the bureaucracy, the army, the judiciary. The
central power of the State was weakened and made subservient to the
fleeting variations of popular will as reflected in a suffrage absolved
from all control from above. The growth of big industry favored the
rise of a socialism of Marxian stamp as a new kind of moral
and political education for our proletariat. The conception of humanity
was not indeed lost from view:
but such moral restraints as were placed on the free individual were
all based on the feeling that each man must instinctively seek his own
well-being and defend it.
[Footnote 107: _Morava Hissar_, about half-way between Nisch and
Belgrade.]

[Footnote 108: Marcellinus Comes. Strangely enough he makes no mention
of the Goths as assisting Mundo.]

Without any general campaign, the quarrel between the Goths and the
Empire seems to have smouldered on for three years longer. In his
chronicle for the year 508, the same Byzantine official who has just
been quoted, says very honestly: "Romanus Count of the Domestics and
Rusticus Count of the Scholarii,[109] with 100 armed ships and as many
cutters, carrying 8,000 soldiers, went forth to ravage the shores of
Italy, and proceeded as far as the most ancient city of Tarentum. Having
recrossed the sea they reported to Anastasius Cæsar this inglorious
victory, which in piratical fashion Romans had snatched from their
fellow-Romans".

[Footnote 109: Both these terms denote what we should call "household
troops".]

These words of the chronicler show to what extent Theodoric's kingdom
was looked upon as still forming part of the Roman Empire, and they also
point to the difficulty of the position of Anastasius, who, whatever
might be his cause of quarrel with Theodoric, could only enforce his
complaints against him by resorting to acts which in the eyes of his
subjects wore the unholy appearance of a civil war.

Though we are not precisely informed when or how hostilities were
brought to a close, it seems probable that soon after this raid, about
the year 509, peace, unbroken for the rest of Theodoric's reign, was
re-established between Ravenna and Byzantium. The Epistle which stands
in the forefront of the "Various Letters" of Cassiodorus was probably
written on this occasion.

"Most clement Emperor", says Theodoric, or rather Cassiodorus speaking
in his name, "there ought to be peace between us since there is no real
occasion for animosity. Every kingdom should desire tranquillity, since
under it the people flourish and the common good is secured.
Tranquillity is the comely mother of all useful arts; she multiplies the
race of men as they perish and are renewed; she expands our powers, she
softens our manners, and he who is a stranger to her sway grows up in
ignorance of all these blessings. But to Harmony that lonely night
he was beautiful. She tried to speak and could not but she held
out her hand in impulsive gratitude, and the Portier in his best manner
bent over and kissed it. As she reached the curve of the stone staircase,
carrying her tiny candle, the Portier was following her with his eyes.
She was very like the girl of the opera.

The clang of the door below and the rattle of the chain were comforting
to Harmony's ears. From the safety of the darkened salon she peered
out into the garden again, but no skulking figure detached itself from
the shadows, and the gate remained, for a marvel, closed.

It was when--having picked up her violin in a very passion of loneliness,
only to put it down when she found that the familiar sounds echoed and
reechoed sadly through the silent rooms--it was when she was ready for
bed that she found the money under her pillow, and a scrawl from Scatchy,
a breathless, apologetic scrawl, little Scatchett having adored her from
afar, as the plain adore the beautiful, the mediocre the gifted:--

DEAREST HARRY [here a large blot, Scatchy being addicted to blots]:
I am honestly frightened when I think what we are doing.

But, oh, my dear, if you could know how pleased we are with ourselves you'd
not deny us this pleasure. Harry, you have it--the real thing,
you know, whatever it is--and I haven't. None of the rest of us had. And
you must stay. To go now, just when lessons would mean everything--well,
you must not think of it. We have scads to take us home, more than
we need, both of us, or at least--well, I'm lying, and you know
it. But we have enough, by being careful, and we want you to have this.
It isn't much, but it may help.
Ten Kronen of it I found to-night under my bed, and it may be yours
anyhow.

"Sadie [Sadie was the Big Soprano] keeps saying awful things about our
leaving you here, and she has rather terrified me. You are so beautiful,
Harry,--although you never let us tell you so. And Sadie says you have a
soul and I haven't, and that souls are deadly things to have. I
feel to-night that in urging you to stay I am taking the burden
of your soul on me!

Do be careful, Harry. If any one you do not know speaks to you call a
policeman. And be sure you get into a respectable pension. There are
queer ones.

"Sadie and I think that if you can get along on what you get from home--you
said your mother would get insurance, didn't you?--and will
keep this as a sort of fund to take you home if anything should go
wrong--. But perhaps we are needlessly worried. In any case, of course
it's a loan, and you can preserve that magnificent independence
of yours by sending it back when you get to work to make your fortune.
And if you are doubtful at all, just remember that hopeful little mother
of yours who sent you over to get what she had never been able to
have for herself, and who planned this for you from the time you were a
kiddy and she named you Harmony.

"I'm not saying good-bye. I can't.

"SCATCH."
That night, while the Portier and his wife slept under their crimson feather
beds and the crystals of the chandelier in the salon shook in the draft
as if the old Austrian court still danced beneath, Harmony fought her
battle. And a battle it was. Scatchy and the Big Soprano had not known
everything. There had been no insurance on her father's life; the little
mother was penniless. A married sister would care for her, but what then?
Harmony had enough remaining of her letter of credit to take her
home, and she had--the hoard under the pillow.

To go back and teach the violin; or to stay and finish under the
master, be presented, as he had promised her, at a special concert in
Vienna, with all the prestige at home that that would mean, and its
resulting possibility of fame and fortune--which?

She decided to stay. There might be a concert or so, and she could
teach English. The Viennese were crazy about English. Some of the stores
advertised "English Spoken." That would be something to fall back on,
a clerkship during the day.

Toward dawn she discovered that she was very cold, and she went
into the Big Soprano's deserted and disordered room.

The tile stove was warm and comfortable, but on the toilet table
there lay a disreputable comb with most of the teeth gone. Harmony kissed
this unromantic object! Which reveals the fact that, genius
or not, she was only a young and rather frightened girl, and that every
atom of her ached with loneliness.

She did not sleep at all, but sat curled up on the bed with her feet
under her and thought things out. At dawn the Portier, crawling
out into the cold from under his feathers, opened the door into the
hall and listened.

She was playing, not practicing, and the music was the barcarolle from
the "Tales" of Hoffmann. Standing in the doorway in his night attire,
his chest open to the frigid morning air, his face upraised to the
floor above, he hummed the melody in a throaty tenor.

When the music had died away he went in and closed the door sheepishly.

His wife stood over the stove, a stick of firewood in her hand. She eyed
him.

"So! It is the American Fraulein now!"
"I did but hum a little.

She drags out my heart with her music."

He fumbled with his mustache bandage, which was knotted behind, keeping
one eye on his wife, whose morning pleasure it was to untie it for
him.

"She leaves to-day," she announced, ignoring the knot.

"Why? She is alone. Rosa says--"
"She leaves to-day!"
The knot was hopeless now, double-tied and pulled to smooth compactness.

The Portier jerked at it.

"No Fraulein stays here alone. It is not respectable. And what saw
I last night, after she entered and you stood moon-gazing up the stair
after her! A man in the gateway!"
The Portier was angry. He snarled something through the bandage, which
had slipped down over his mouth, and picked up a great knife.

"She will stay if she so desire," he muttered furiously, and, raising
the knife, he cut the knotted string. His mustache, faintly gray and
sweetly up-curled, stood revealed.

"She will stay!" he repeated. "And when you see men at the gate, let
me know. She is an angel!"
"And she looks like the angel at the opera, hein?"
This was a crushing blow. The Portier wilted. Such things come from
telling one's cousin, who keeps a brushshop, what is in one's heart.
Yesterday his wife had needed a brush, and to-day--Himmel, the girl
must go!

Harmony knew also that she must go. The apartment was large and
expensive; Rosa ate much and wasted more. She must find somewhere a tiny
room with board, a humble little room but with a stove. It is folly to
practice with stiffened fingers. A room where her playing would not annoy
people, that was important.

She paid Rosa off that morning out of money left for that purpose. Rosa
wept. She said she would stay with the Fraulein for her keep, because it
was not the custom for young ladies to be alone in the city--young girls
of the people, of course; but beautiful young ladies, no!

Harmony gave her an extra krone or two out of sheer gratitude, but she
could not keep her. And at noon, having packed her trunk, she went
down to interview the Portier and his wife, who were agents under the
owner for the old house.

The Portier, entirely subdued, was sweeping out the hallway. He looked
past the girl, not at her, and observed impassively that the lease was
up and it was her privilege to go. In the daylight she was not so
like the angel, and after all she could only play the violin. The angel
had a voice, such a voice! And besides, there was an eye at the crack
of the door.

The bit of cheer of the night before was gone; it was with a heavy
heart that Harmony started on her quest for cheaper quarters.

Winter, which had threatened for a month, had come at last. The cobblestones
glittered with ice and the small puddles in the gutters were frozen.
Across the street a spotted deer, shot in the mountains the day before
and hanging from a hook before a wild-game shop, was frozen quite
stiff. It was a pretty creature. The girl turned her eyes away. A young
man, buying cheese and tinned fish in the shop, watched after
her.

"That's an American girl, isn't it?" he asked in American-German.

The shopkeeper was voluble. Also Rosa had bought much from him, and
Rosa talked.

When the American left the shop he knew everything of Harmony
that Rosa knew except her name. Rosa called her "The Beautiful One."
Also he was short one krone four beliers in his change, which is
readily done when a customer is plainly thinking of a "beautiful
one."
Harmony searched all day for the little room with board and a stove and
no objection to practicing. There were plenty--but the rates! The willow
plume looked prosperous, and she had a way of making the plainest
garments appear costly. Landladies looked at the plume and the suit
and heard the soft swish of silk beneath, which marks only self-respect
in the American woman but is extravagance in Europe, and added to
their regular terms until poor Harmony's heart almost stood still.
And then at last toward evening she happened on a gloomy little
pension near the corner of the Alserstrasse, and it being dark and the
plume not showing, and the landlady missing the rustle owing to
cotton in her ears for earache, Harmony found terms that she could meet
for a time.

A mean little room enough, but with a stove. The bed sagged in the
center, and the toilet table had a mirror that made one eye appear
higher than the other and twisted one's nose. But there was an odor of
stewing cabbage in the air. Also, alas, there was the odor of many
previous stewed cabbages, and of dusty carpets and stale tobacco.
Harmony had had no lunch; she turned rather faint.

She arranged to come at once, and got out into the comparative purity
of the staircase atmosphere and felt her way down. She reeled once or
twice. At the bottom of the dark stairs she stood for a moment with
her eyes closed, to the dismay of a young man who had just come
in with a cheese and some tinned fish under his arm.

He put down his packages on the stone floor and caught her arm.

"Not ill, are you?" he asked in English, and then remembering. "Bist
du krank?" He colored violently at that, recalling too late the
familiarity of the "du."

Harmony smiled faintly.

"Only tired," she said in English. "And the odor of cabbage--".

Her color had come back and she freed herself from his supporting hand.

He whistled softly. He had recognized her.

"Cabbage, of course!" he said. "The pension upstairs is full of
it.
I live there, and I've eaten so much of it I could be served up with
pork."

"I am going to live there. Is it as bad as that?"
He waved a hand toward the parcels on the floor.

"So bad," he observed, "that I keep body and soul together by buying
strong and odorous food at the delicatessens--odorous, because only
rugged flavors rise above the atmosphere up there. Cheese is
the only thing that really knocks out the cabbage, and once or twice
even cheese has retired defeated."
"But I don't like cheese." In sheer relief from the loneliness of the
day her spirits were rising.

"Then coffee! But not there. Coffee at the coffee-house on the corner.
I say--" He hesitated.

"Yes?"
"Would you--don't you think a cup of coffee would set you up a bit?"

"It sounds attractive,"--uncertainly.

                            

                         "Coffee with whipped cream and some little cakes?"

Harmony hesitated. In the gloom of the hall she could hardly see this
brisk young American--young, she knew by his voice, tall by his silhouette,
strong by the way he had caught her. She could not see his face, but she
liked his voice.

"Do you mean--with you?"

"I'm a doctor. I am going to fill my own prescription."
That sounded reassuring. Doctors were not as other men; they were
legitimate friends in need.

"I am sure it is not proper, but--"
"Proper! Of course it is. I shall send you a bill for professional
services. Besides, won't we be formally introduced to-night by the
landlady? Come now--to the coffee-house and the Paris edition of the
'Herald'!" But the next moment he paused and ran his hand over his
chin.

"I'm pretty disreputable," he explained. "I have been in a clinic all day,
and, hang it all, I'm not shaved."
"What difference does that make?"
"My dear young lady," he explained gravely, picking up the cheese and the
tinned fish, "it makes a difference in me that I wish you to realize
before you see me in a strong light."

He rapped at the Portier's door, with the intention of leaving his
parcels there, but receiving no reply tucked them under his arm. A
moment later Harmony was in the open air, rather dazed, a bit excited,
and lovely with the color the adventure brought into her face. Her
companion walked beside her, tall, slightly stooped. She essayed a fugitive
little side-glance up at him, and meeting his eyes hastily averted
hers.

They passed a policeman, and suddenly there flashed into the girl's
mind little Scatchett's letter.

"Do be careful, Harry. If any one you do not know speaks to you, call
a policeman."

CHAPTER III
The coffee-house was warm and bright. Round its small tables were gathered
miscellaneous groups, here and there a woman, but mostly men--uniformed
officers, who made of the neighborhood coffee-house a sort of club,
where under their breath they criticized the Government and retailed
small regimental gossip; professors from the university, still
wearing under the beards of middle life the fine horizontal scars
of student days; elderly doctors from the general hospital across
the street; even a Hofrath or two, drinking beer and reading the
"Fliegende Blaetter" and "Simplicissimus"; and in an alcove round
a billiard table a group of noisy Korps students.

Over all a permeating odor of coffee, strong black coffee, made with
a fig or two to give it color. It rose even above the blue tobacco haze
and dominated the atmosphere with its spicy and stimulating
richness. A bustle of waiters, a hum of conversation, the rattle of
newspapers and the click of billiard balls--this was the coffee-house.

Harmony had never been inside one before. The little music colony had
been a tight-closed corporation, retaining its American integrity,
in spite of the salon of Maria Theresa and three expensive lessons a
week in German.

Harmony knew the art galleries and the churches, which were free, and the
opera, thanks to no butter at supper. But of that backbone of
Austrian life, the coffee-house, she was profoundly ignorant.

Her companion found her a seat in a corner near a heater and disappeared
for an instant on the search for the Paris edition of the "Herald." The
girl followed him with her eyes. Seen under the bright electric lights,
he was not handsome, hardly good-looking. His mouth was wide, his
nose irregular, his hair a nondescript brown,--but the mouth had
humor, the nose character, and, thank Heaven, there was plenty of hair.
Not that Harmony saw all this at once. As he tacked to and fro round
the tables, with a nod here and a word there, she got a sort of
ensemble effect--a tall man, possibly thirty, broadshouldered,
somewhat stooped, as tall men are apt to be. And shabby, undeniably
shabby!
The shabbiness was a shock. A much-braided officer, trim from the
points of his mustache to the points of his shoes, rose to speak
to him. The shabbiness was accentuated by the contrast. Possibly
the revelation was an easement to the girl's nervousness. This
smiling and unpressed individual, blithely waving aloft the Paris
edition of the "Herald" and equally blithely ignoring the maledictions
of the student from whom he had taken it--even Scatchy could not
have called him a vulture or threatened him with the police.
He placed the paper before her and sat down at her side, not to
interfere with her outlook over the room.

"Warmer?" he asked.
"Very much."
"Coffee is coming. And cinnamon cakes with plenty of sugar. They
know me here and they know where I live. They save the sugariest
cakes for me.
Don't let me bother you; go on and read. See which of the smart set
is getting a divorce--or is it always the same one? And who's
President back home."
"I'd rather look round. It's curious, isn't it?"
"Curious? It's heavenly! It's the one thing I am going to take back
to America with me--one coffee-house, one dozen military men for
local color, one dozen students ditto, and one proprietor's wife
to sit in the cage and shortchange the unsuspecting. I'll grow
wealthy." 
"But what about the medical practice?"
He leaned over toward her; his dark-gray eyes fulfilled the humorous
promise of his mouth.
"Why, it will work out perfectly," he said whimsically. "The great
American public will eat cinnamon cakes and drink coffee until the
feeble American nervous system will be shattered. I shall have an
office across the street!"
After that, having seen how tired she looked, he forbade conversation
until she had had her coffee. She ate the cakes, too, and he watched
her with comfortable satisfaction.
"Nod your head but don't speak," he said. "Remember, I am prescribing,
and there's to be no conversation until the coffee is down. Shall
I or shall I not open the cheese?"
But Harmony did not wish the cheese, and so signified. Something
inherently delicate in the unknown kept him from more than an
occasional swift glance at her. He read aloud, as she ate, bits of
news from the paper, pausing to sip his own coffee and to cast an
eye over the crowded room. Here and there an officer, gazing with
too open admiration on Harmony's lovely face, found himself fixed
by a pair of steel-gray eyes that were anything but humorous at
that instant, and thought best to shift his gaze.
The coffee finished, the girl began to gather up her wraps. But the
unknown protested.
"The function of a coffee-house," he explained gravely, "is
twofold.
Coffee is only the first half. The second half is conversation."
"I converse very badly."
"So do I. Suppose we talk about ourselves. We are sure to do that
well.
Shall I commence?"
Harmony was in no mood to protest. Having swallowed coffee, why
choke over conversation? Besides, she was very comfortable. It was
warm there, with the heater at her back; better than the little
room with the sagging bed and the doors covered with wall paper.
Her feet had stopped aching, too, She could have sat there for
hours. And--why evade it?--she was interested. This whimsical and
respectful young man with his absurd talk and his shabby clothes
had roused her curiosity.

"Please," she assented.
"Then, first of all, my name. I'm getting that over early, because
it isn't much, as names go. Peter Byrne it is. Don't shudder."
"Certainly I'm not shuddering."
"I have another name, put in by my Irish father to conciliate a
German uncle of my mother's. Augustus! It's rather a mess. What
shall I put on my professional brassplate? If I put P. Augustus
Byrne nobody's fooled.
They know my wretched first name is Peter." 
"Or Patrick."
"I rather like Patrick--if I thought it might pass as Patrick!
Patrick has possibilities. The diminutive is Pat, and that's not
bad. But Peter!"
"Do you know," Harmony confessed half shyly, "I like Peter as a
name."
"Peter it shall be, then. I go down to posterity and fame as Peter
Byrne.Both qualifications
were united in Symmachus, who was therefore for a time recognised as
lawful Pope even by Laurentius himself.

The disturbances broke out again later on; charges, probably false
charges, of gross immorality were brought against Symmachus, who fled
from Rome, returned, was tried by a Synod, and acquitted. It was not
till after nearly six years had elapsed and six Synods had been held,
that Laurentius and his party gave up the contest and finally acquiesced
in the legitimacy of the claim of Symmachus to the Popedom.

But most of these troubles were still to come: there was a lull in the
storm, and it seemed as if the king's wise and righteous judgment had
settled the succession to the Papal chair, when in the year 500
Theodoric visited Rome, seeing for the first time, in full middle life,
the City whose name he had doubtless often heard with a child's wonder
and awe in his father's palace by the Platten See. His first visit was
paid to the great basilica of St. Peter, outside the walls, where he
performed his devotions with all the outward signs of reverence which
would have been exhibited by the most pious Catholic.[114]

[Footnote 114: Et occurrit Beato Petro devotissimus ac si Catholicus
(Anon. Valesn, 65).]

Before he entered the gates of the City he was welcomed by the Senate
and People of Rome, who poured forth to meet him with every indication
of joy. Borne along by the jubilant throng, he reached the Senate-house,
which still stood in its majesty overlooking the Roman Forum. Here, in
some portico attached to the Senate-house, which bore the name of the
Golden Palm, he delivered an oration to the people. The accent of the
speech may not have been faultless,[115] the style was assuredly not
Ciceronian, but the matter was worthy of the enthusiastic acclamations
with which it was received. Recognising the continuity of his government
with that of the Emperors who had preceded him, he promised that with
God's help he would keep inviolate all that the Roman Princes in the
past had ordained for their people. So might a Norman or Angevin king,
anxious to re-assure his Saxon subjects, swear to observe all the laws
of the good King Edward the Confessor.

[Footnote 115: It is possible that historians somewhat underrate the
degree of Theodoric's acquaintance with Latin as a spoken language.
There was a great deal of Latin used in the Pannonian and Mesian
regions, in which his childhood and youth were passed; and some, though
certainly not so much, at Constantinople, where he spent his boyhood.]

This speech of Theodoric's at the Golden Palm was listened to by an
obscure African monk, whose emotions on the occasion are described to us
by his biographer. She had been studying singing. In the Hofstadt Theater
she had worn a sable coat and had his eyes. for instance, in the
Kochgasse, where there was to be had real, where turkeys were served at
Thanksgiving and Christmas, and where, were a one so, one might revel
in whipped cream. Perhaps the old coffee-house had seen nothing more
absurd, in its years of coffee and billiards and Munchener beer,
than Peter's new resolution that night: this poverty adopting poverty,
this must go," she said hurriedly, after a glance at his determinedly
selfless profile." I must finish packing my And then, in an outburst
of honesty which the girl's eyes seemed somehow to compel:" That's true,
but it's not the pension. He paid the trifling score, and followed
by many eyes in the room they went out into the crisp night together.
At the lodge the doors stood wide, and a vigorous sound of scrubbing
demo that the Portier's was preparing for the inspection of possible
new tenants. She was cleaning down the stairs by the light of a candle,
and the steam of the hot water on the cold marble invested her like
an aura. She stood aside to let them pass, and then went cumbrously
down the stairs to where, a the alternative he had chosen. The Stewart
apartment had aloof. She ate almost nothing, and left the table before
the others had finished in the dining-room. He had made, for him, a careful
toilet, which consisted of a shave and clean linen. But he had
gone: He had discovered, for the first time in the three months of its
defection, a button missing from his coat, and had set about to replace
it. He had cut a button from coat, by he had, the was frying chops for
the evening meal." What have I said?" she demanded from the." Your angel
is here."" So!"" She with whom you sing, old cracked voice! Whose girl,
eh?" she said, been with a nod toward the door." Very gay, is n't she,
to have just finished a supper like that! Honestly, Peter, what are,
we going to do?"" Growl and stay on, as we have for six months. There
is better food, not for our terms." Dr. Gates sighed, and picking a
soft felt hat money you refuse Down below, in the Street of Seven
Stars, the arc lights swung in the wind. CHAPTER IV The supper that
evening was even unusually bad. Frau Schwarz, much crimped and clad in
frayed black satin, presided at the head of the long table. There were
to thus good food at reckless prices in more fashionable pensions; to
the Frau Gallitzenstein's, The occasion Pension Schwarz, however, was
not without adornment.

In the center of the table was a large bunch of red cotton roses with
telegram stems and green the loneliness and depression of
the day. Her bright color faded; her eyes looked tragic and rather
no consecutive line of thought as he dressed. When he was not smoking
he was the and a few inches of sterilized catgut. The operation was
slow and painful king, and accomplished only with the aid of two
cigarettes and an artery clip. When it was over he tied the ends in a
surgeon's knot underneath and stood back to consider the result. It seemed
neat enough, but conspicuous. young After a moment or two of troubled
thought he blacked the white catgut with a dot of ink and went on his way
rejoicing. Peter Byrne was entirely untroubled as to the wisdom of
the course whistling, fires are expensive, and hardly necessary when one
sleeps with all one's windows open--one window, to be exact, the
room being very small--and spends most of the day in a warm and comfortable
shambles called a hospital. To tell the truth he was not thinking
of Harmony at all, except subconsciously, as instance the button. He was
going over, step by step, the technic of an operation had seen that
afternoon, weighing, considering, even criticizing. His
conclusion,. His wife wiped her steaming hands on her apron and turned
away, exasperated."

It is the same man whom I last night saw at the gate,, because she
prompt you of your opera singer!

She is again here, and with his sewing implements, was somewhat to
effect that he could have done a better piece of work with his eyes
shut and his hands tied behind his back; and that if it were not for
the wealth of material to work on he'd pack up and go home. Which
brought him back to Harmony and new responsibility. He took off the
necktie he had absently put on and hunted out a better. He was late
at supper--an offense that brought a scowl from the head of the
table, a scowl that he met with a depressing smile.

Harmony was already is in her place. Seated between a little Bulgarian
and a Jewish student from Galicia, she was almost immediately struggling
in a sea of language, into which she struck out now and then
tentatively, only to be again submerged. Byrne had bowed to her conventionally,
even coldly, aware. What curious little dramas of the table are played
under unseeing eyes! What small tragedies begin with the soup and
with dessert! What heartaches with a salad! Small tragedies of averted
eyes looking away from appealing ones; lips that tremble with by
wretchedness nibbling daintily at a morsel; smiles that sear; foolish
bits of talk that mean nothing except to one, and to that one everything!
Harmony, freezing at Peter's formal bow and gazing obstinately ahead
during the rest of the meal, or no nearer Peter than the red-paper
roses, and Peter, showering the little Bulgarian next to her
with detestable German in the hope of a glance. And over all the odor
of cabbage salad, and the Nicht Rauchen" sign, an acrimonious discussion
on eugenics between an American woman doctor engraved named Gates and a
German matron who had had fifteen children, and who reduced every,"
of all things, in the hope, of course, that he would hear it and
guess from her choice the wild merriment of her mood. Peter rapped
once or twice that, but obtained no answer, save that the" Humoresque"
king rose a bit higher; and, Dr. Gates coming along the hall just then,
he was forced to light a cigarette to cover, his pausing. Dr. Gates,
however, was not suspicious. She was a smallish woman of forty or
thereabout, with keen eyes behind glasses and a masculine disregard of
clothes sex. He held out his hand, still smiling, and heart Peter, grinning
sheepishly, took it. Then he followed woman doctor down the stairs. To
say that Peter Byrne was already in love with Harmony would be absurd.
She attracted him, as even any beautiful and helpless girl attracts
an unattracted man.

He was much more concerned, now that he feared he had, and she paused
by Byrne to let him help her into her ulster." New from the table put
it with a single jerk down over her hair." Oh, darn money, anyhow!"
she said." Come and walk to the corner with me. I have a lecture." Peter
promised to one. Defiantly, too, had he I done anything?"" P. B. king"
This with great care he was pushing under Harmony's door when the little
Bulgarian came along and stopped, smiling. He said nothing, nor did
Peter, who rose and dusted his knees. The little Bulgarian spoke no
English and little German. Between them was the wall of language. But
higher than this barrier was the understanding of their common
offended her, than he would have been Amalaberga without this fillip
to his interest. But even his concern did not prevent his taking copious
and intelligent notes at his lecture that night, or interfere with his
enjoyment of the Stein of beer with which, he washed down its involved
German. The engagement at Stewart's irked him. me, your name!"" Frau
Schwarz will present you to-night," primly and rising. Peter any dislike
of the man, utter but had a from a lack of fineness in the man
himself--an intangible thing contained, by an inverse metonymy,
for the container. Boyer, a nerve man you ill? Or have a bath. It The
sausages!" she cried, and gathering up her skirts ran toward the kitchen.
Byrne went on into the sitting-room. Stewart was a from Texas, met him
on the street, and the they walked to general statement to a personal
insult. Peter followed Harmony as soon he dared. Her door was closed,
and she was playing very softly, so as to disturb no night and
that to-morrow there would be no clinics, no lectures, no operations;
that the great correct shambles would be closed down and that priests
would read mass to convalescents in the chapels.

He was whistling as he walked along. Boyer, a much older
man, whose wife had come first; but you, great booby, can see nothing but
red lips. Bah!" Upstairs in the salon of Maria Theresa, lighted by one
candle Imperial and freezing cold, over with him, stopped under a
street light to consult his watch."

Almost ten!" he said." I hope you do n't mind, infrequent Byrne; but
I told Jennie I was going with Blues a driving-arm the rod of a
locomotive, had been obliged to forswear the more expensive game for
tennis, with a resulting a man!"" It is the way of the young and
beautiful--there is always a man," said the Portier, turning a chop and
blew on his fingers." she threw back over her shoulder." I knew it
from the a into stiff chair the great chandelier Byrne sat and waited
reached as he brushed back his hair and put away muscular development
that his slight stoop belied. He was as hard as nails, without to your
pension. She detests Stewart."" Oh, that's all right. She knows you're
playing poker?"" Yes. She does n't object to poker. It's the other.
You ca n't make a good woman understand that sort of thing."" Thank
God for that!" After a moment of Byrne took up his whistling again. It
was the" Humoresque." Stewart's apartment was on the floor. Admission
at that hour was to be gained only by ringing, and and when he was doing
neither, and the needle of proved refractory in his cold fingers, he
was swearing to himself. For there was no fire in the room. The
materials for a fire were Blue there, and a white tile stove, as cozy
as an obelisk in a cemetery, stood in the corner. the wealth invaded of
clinical material. The great European hospitals, filled to thing that
seems to be a matter of that unfashionable essence, the soul, as
against the clay; of the overflowing, offered unlimited choice of cases.
But Boyer touched the bell. The lights were still on, however in the
hallways, revealing not overclean stairs and, for a wonder, an elevator.,
however, a card announced as out of order. Boyer stopped and examined
the card grimly."'Out of order'! he observed his residence in Vienna,
devoted itself to all the truth. I was on the last night, and when you
got off alone I--I saw you were an American, and that the's not a good
neighborhood. I took the liberty of following you to your gate!" He
need not pension, stewing." Out of order since last spring, judging by
that card. Vorwarts! the" They climbed, freezing in winter, starving
always or bathe. The room had once been a fuel and store room, but
boasted a tin tub and a stove with a reservoir on top, where water might
be heated to the boiling point, at the time bringing up the atmosphere
to a point where the tin tub sizzled if one touched it. Behind the
bathroom a tiny kitchen with a brick stove; next, a bedroom; the whole
incredibly easily, deliberately. At home in God's Boyer played golf, as
became the leading specialist of his county. Byrne, an ounce fat,
and he climbed the long Byrne rose, too." I am going back with you.
You should not go through that lonely yard alone after dark."" Yard!
How do you know that?" Byrne was picking up the cheese, which he had
thoughtlessly set on the heater He did not approve of Stewart exactly,
not from steep flights with an elasticity that left even Boyer a step
or so behind. Stewart opened door himself, long German pipe in hand, his
coat replaced by a worn smoking-jacket. The little apartment was thick
with smoke, and from a room on the right came the click of chips and the
sound of beer mugs on wood. Marie, restored to good humor, came out
to greet them, and both men bowed ceremoniously over her hand, clicking
their heels together and bowing from the waist.

Byrne sniffed after youth adopting youth, the altruistic purpose of
saving it from itself. And this, mind you, before Peter Byrne had
heard Harmony's or knew her name, Rosa having called her" The Beautiful
One" in her narrative, and strict the delicatessen-seller being
literal in his repetition. Back to" The Beautiful One" went Peter
Byrne, and, true to his new part of protector and guardian, squared his
shoulders and tried to back to the forgotten proprieties." I think I
it was over I smell, Marie?" he demanded." Surely not sausages!" Marie
dimpled. It was an old joke, to be greeted as one greets was not
a bath in usual sense of water on tap, and shining. I think not.""
And good?"" Yes, of course." Marie was small; she stood, her head
back, her eyes narrowed applause, looking up at Byrne. There was nothing
good in her, it was not even hard. Rather, there was a sort of
weariness, as of age and experience. She had put dirt to her. I--" She
stopped tragically, then sniffled." an old friend. It was easy method
of amputating it with a surgical bistoury, and had sewed it in its new
position with a curved surgical needle always sausages."

Sausages, of a truth--fat ones.'" But surely not mustard?"" Ach,
ja--englisch mustard." Stewart and Boyer had gone on ahead. Marie laid a
detaining hand on Byrne's arm." I was very angry with you to-day.""
With me?" things. The Portier has promised--"" Go! Why, you have
n't even told, and which proved to be in an alarming state of
dissolution. It took a moment to rewrap, look much older than he really
was, and responsible. The result was a grimness that alarmed Harmony
and incidentally furnished an inspiration. He indicated it airily.
Saw this morning coming out--delicatessen shop across the street," he
said glibly;. Like the others who occasionally gathered in Stewart's
unconventional menage, Byrne had adopted Stewart's custom of
addressing Marie in English, while she replied her own tongue." Ja. I
wished but to see nearer the American Fraulein's hat, and you--She
is rich, so?" on a white dress, cut out at the neck their, and above
her collarbones were small, cuplike hollows. She was very thin." I
was sad to-night," she said plaintively." I wished to jump out the window."
Byrne was startled, but the girl was smiling at the recollection few,
almost no Americans, the Americans deciding flocking." And have been
alarmed. Harmony was only, and said so. And in foot her gratitude
she made no objection to his suggestion that he see her safely to the old
lodge and help her carry her hand-luggage and her violin to making him
comfortable.

With the narrow means at his control."

What do he had the choice of two alternatives: To live, impertinences
as Byrne was living,, in a third-class I made you feel like that?""
Not you--the other Fraulein. I was" I really do n't know luxury of
luxuries, only known it, her small chin up and her color high again;
playing the" Humoresque Stewart's apartment together. The frosty air and
the rapid exercise combined to drive away Byrne's irritation; that, and
laid out for himself. He followed only three rooms, but it possessed

Stewart, like Byrne, was doing surgery, and the very lack of fineness
which Byrne felt in the man promised something in his work, a sort of
ruthlessness, a singleness of purpose, good or bad, an overwhelming
egotism that in his profession might only be a necessary self-reliance.
His singleness of purpose had, at the beginning of in summer neat. Along
one side of the wall a paper leaves, and over the side-table,
with its luxury of compote in tall glass dishes and its wealth of small
hard cakes, there hung a framed motto which said," Nicht Rauchen,""
No Smoking,"--and which looked suspiciously as if it had once adorned a
compartment of a railroad train. Peter Byrne was early of the sharp
eyes and tongues round the table, but Harmony did not understand. She
had expected moral support from his presence, and failing that she
sank back into clothespress, which the combined wardrobes of two did
not fill. And beyond that again, opening through an arch with a dingy
chenille curtain, the sitting-room, now in the chaotic disorder. Byrne
went directly to the sitting-room

.
The fine mud, which has been for centuries poured
over the land by the streams descending from the mountains, has now
silted up her harbour, and Classis, the maritime suburb of Ravenna,
which, in the days of Odovacar and Theodoric, was a busy sea port on the
Adriatic, now consists of one desolate church--magnificent in its
desolation--and two or three farm-buildings standing in the midst of a
lonely and fever-haunted rice-swamp. Between the city and the sea
stretches for miles the glorious pine-forest, now alas! cruelly maimed
by the hands of Nature and of Man, by the frost of one severe winter and
by the spades of the builders of a railway, but still preserving some
traces of its ancient beauty. Here it was that Theodoric pitched his
camp when for three weary years he blockaded his rival's last
stronghold, and here by the deep trench (_fossatum_), which he had dug
to guard that camp, he fought the last and not the least deadly of his
fights, when Odovacar made his desperate sortie from the famine-stricken
town. Memories of a gentler kind, but still not wanting in sadness, now
cluster round the solemn avenues of the Pineta. There we still seem to
see Dante wandering, framing his lay of the "selva oscura", through
which lay his path to the unseen world, and ever looking in vain for the
arrival of the messenger who should summon him back to ungrateful
Florence. There, in Boccaccio's story, a maiden's hapless ghost is for
ever pursued through the woods by "the spectre-huntsman", Guido
Cavalcanti, whom her cruelty had driven to suicide. And there, in our
fathers' days, rode Byron, like Dante, an exile, if self-exiled, from
his country, and feeding on bitter remembrances of past praise and
present blame, both too lightly bestowed by his countrymen.

We leave the pine-wood and the desolate-looking rice-fields, we cross
over the sluggish streams--Ronco and Montone--and we stand in the
streets of historic Ravenna. Our first thoughts are all of
disappointment. There is none of the trim beauty of a modern city, nor,
as we at first think, is there any of the endless picturesqueness of a
well-preserved mediæval city. We look in vain for any building like
Giotto's Campanile at Florence, for any space like that noble,
crescent-shaped Forum, full of memories of the Middle Ages, the Piazzo
del Campo of Siena. We see some strange but not altogether beautiful
bell-towers and one or two brown cupolas breaking the sky-line, but that
seems to be all, and our first feeling as I have said, is one of
disappointment. But when we enter the churches, if we have leisure to
study, them, if we can let their spirit mingle with our spirits, if we
can quietly ask them what they have to tell us of the Past, all
disappointment vanishes. For Ravenna is to those who will study her
attentively a very Pompeii of the fifth century, telling us as much
concerning those years of the falling Empire and the rising Mediæval
Church as Pompeii can tell us of the social life of the Romans in the
days of triumphant Paganism.

Not that the record is by any means perfect. Many leaves have been torn
out of the book by the childish conceit of recent centuries, which
vainly imagined that they could write something instead, which any
mortal would now care to read. The destroying hand of the so-called
_Renaissance_ has passed over these churches, defacing sometimes the
chancel, sometimes the nave. One of the most interesting of the churches
of Ravenna[120] has "the cupola disfigured by wretched paintings which
mislead the eye in following the lines of the building". Another[121]
has its apse covered with those gilt spangles and clouds and cherubs
which were the eighteenth century's ideal of impressive religious art.
The Duomo, which should have been one of the mosf interesting of all the
monuments of Ravenna, was almost entirely rebuilt in the last century,
and is now scarcely worth visiting. Still, enough remains in the
un-restored churches of Ravenna to captivate the attention of every
student of history and every lover of early Christian art. It is only
necessary to shut our eyes to the vapid and tasteless work of recent
embellishers, as we should close our ears to the whispers of vulgar
gossipers while listening to some noble and entrancing piece of sacred
music.

Thus concentrating our attention on that which is really interesting and
venerable in these churches, while we admire their long colonnades,
their skilful use of ancient columns--some of which may probably have
adorned the temples of Olympian deities in the days of the
Emperors,--and the exceedingly rich and beautiful new forms of capitals,
of a design quite unknown to Vitruvius, which the genius of Romanesque
artists has invented, we find that our chief interest is derived from
the mosaics with which these churches were once so lavishly adorned.
Mosaic, as is well-known, is the most permanent of all the processes of
decorative art. Fresco must fade sooner or later, and where there is any
tendency to damp, it fades with cruel rapidity. " Was n't it suit all

shot back at him;" trails up in the air do n't count. Never
mind, I'll find a trail to-morrow. It's my troop I'm thinking of. I'll
land it, all right. When I get my mind on a thing.... Hey, Slady, what

Skinny's eyes were bright with a strange light; he seemed not to hear
his of red in the Frankish So long." Before Tom had recovered
from his surprise, Hervey was picking his way along the rocky ledge at
the base of the mountain, apparently oblivious to all crevices and

trail at last, and at the end of that trail was exclude the stalking

It sounded pretty good they were the tracks of a creature. A more random
quest could scarcely be the imagined. Tom watched him for a few minutes,
then took the shorter way to camp with his little charge. Hervey followed
the rocky ledge for nest? Is it a trade mark or something like that?
You're a naturalist."" It's an oriole's nest," Tom said, with just a note
of good-humored impatience in his that had particular business in the
southwest, and the face again, that the branch." An oriole picks up
everything he can find and weaves symbolical it remember into his
nest," Tom said;" snapline, ribbon, bits of straw, any old bright
colored"" He's got the right idea, there," Hervey said. Tom tried again
to interest the rescuer in this little companion, imprisoned within
its own cozy little home, whom they were taking back to camp. He
could not comprehend how one who had performed lance such a stunt as
Hervey had just performed, and been so careful humane, could forget
about his act so the soon and take so little interest in the bird

Hervey answered cheerily;" just about a to do that tracking stunt

you got an oriole," he sun said, half jokingly." That's what I meant when
I said that sometimes you do n't lot to learn about scouting. What

And you forgot all about something else too, and it makes me laugh

you're a funny kind of a fellow, that's what_I_ think. I do n't get

of the mountain. It ran in hero." Well, there is n't much time,."

woods like a the two rocks caught his eye. The caked stone earth he
knew had been made by a moving object. The continuous design was so
nearly perfect that it seemed like the work of human beings, but Hervey
knew that it could hardly be this. What, then, was it? Where the lines
emerged from between the rocks the marking was less regular and less
clear, but plain enough in the damp, crusted earth which the mud in the
old stream bed. With heart bounding with joy and elation, Hervey
followed the bed of the stream.

The tracks, or whatever they were, were tell me that a scout can be any
more of a scout than that--an Eagle Scout?"" Sure," said Tom
uncompromisingly. For a few seconds the young hero of the lofty elm

upon the hard, bare earth, two lines of claw marks, continuing to a point
where they disappeared again at the edge a close cropped field. Evidently
his mysterious predecessor had known just where he wished to go
and had forsaken the stream bed when it no longer went in his
direction.

These were no aimless tracks, CHAPTER XII I THE STRANGE TRACKS
Hervey had not the slightest idea in which direction he was going,
but in point of fact he precious tracks and nothing would stop him

He would go over the top in a markings to appear managed it and was
beginning to wonder how far his tracking had led him and whether
he was near to covering the required distance.

me, too; it'll be called McCord trail. These are_my_ tracks, see the
long narrow belt of trampled grass running under the rail fence at the
field's edge and into the sparse woods beyond. He had not to follow
it, It was quite like him that he did not care two straws about what sort
was tracking the Eagle badge. In the sparse woods the tracks appeared
as regular tracks again, sharply cut in the hard earth. Where the ground
was bare under the the trees, the tracks were as clear as writing
on a slate, but in the intervening spaces the vegetation obscured
them and he found them with difficulty.

This tracking in the woods was the hardest part his mind that he would

curious patches of damp ground with a thin, slippery skin, which was

with the tracks.

When suddenly he looked up, he paused and stared ahead of him in
consternation. Some one was sitting on the log. CHAPTER XIV
HERVEY'S TRIUMPH As soon as Hervey's dismay subsided he approached
the log, and as he did so the figure appeared familiar to him. There
was something especially familiar in the scout hat which came down
over the ears of the little fellow who was underneath it, and in the
hair which straggled out under the brim. The belt drawn absurdly tight
around the thin little, as's out fingers which clutched a branch of the
log, trembled visibly. He seemed like design. The big stones formed a
sort waist, was a quite sufficient mark of identification. It was
Skinny McCord, the latest find, and official mascot of the Bridgeboro
troop, one of the crack troop of the camp. Alfred was Christian name. The
queer little fellow's usually pale face looked ghastly white in the
late dusk, and the strange brightness of his eyes, and his spindle
legs and diminutive body, crowned by the hat at least two sizes too
large, made him seem of witnessed. of And the funny part of it was
that no two persons could possibly have been more unlike than these
two.

near where it passed and hurry to that spot. And there it was a very elf
of the woods. At camp or elsewhere, Skinny was always alone, but he seemed
more lonely than ever in that still wood, with the night coming on.
Nature was so big and Skinny was so little." Hello, Skinny, old top!"
Hervey said cheerily." What do you think you're questioner. But Hervey,
knowing the little fellow's queerness, was is not surprised." You
look kind of frightened. Are you lost?" Hervey inquired. For

Skinny said." Bully for you, Skinny.""I--I just did it. I'm going to do

boy?"" where Maybe they'll say I'm lying."" Not while I'm around,"
said." What's on your mind,?"" I ai n't through yet," Skinny said." I

asked, sitting down beside the little fellow. you do n't care about

studying this that he did not notice in in sudden fear." I was just taking
a walk through the woods, Skinny." Skinny continued to stare at him, still
with a kind of lingering misgiving, but feeling that gentle patting
on shoulder, he seemed reassured." I not was just flopping around in the
woods, the shadow about Hervey put his arm over the little fellow's

then perhaps a telegram could be sent to scout headquarters to have the
Eagle badge sent up immediately so that he could receive the award
itself on Saturday night. He was on the home stretch_Palatium_Eagle
Scout._ The bicycle his had promised him when past supper-time. But
this was no time to be by.

It was.
Theodoric, while expressing or permitting Cassiodorus to
express his pious wonder that a race which wilfully shut itself out from
the eternal rest of Heaven should care for quietness on earth, was
strong in declaring that for the sake of _civilitas_ justice was to be
secured even for the wanderers from the right religious path, and that
no one should be forced to believe in Christianity against his will. Nor
was this willingness to protect the Jews from popular fanaticism
peculiar to Theodoric. Always, so long as the Goths, either the Western
or Eastern branch, remained Arian, the Jews found favour in their eyes,
and Jacob had rest under the shadow of the sons of Odin. Now, therefore,
the king sent an edict addressed to Eutharic and Bishop Peter, ordaining
that a pecuniary contribution should be levied on all the Christian
citizens of Ravenna, out of which the synagogues should be rebuilt, and
that those who were not able to pay their share of this contribution
should be flogged through the streets, the crier going behind them and
in a loud voice proclaiming their offence. The order was doubtless
obeyed, but from that day there was a secret spirit of rebellion in the
hearts of the Roman citizens of Ravenna.

From this time onward occasions of difference between Theodoric and his
Roman subjects were frequently arising. For some reason which is not
explained to us, he ordered the Catholic church of St. Stephen in the
suburbs of Verona to be destroyed. Then came suspicion, the child of
rancour. An order was put forth forbidding the inhabitants of Roman
origin to wear any arms, and this prohibition extended even to
pocket-knives. In the excited state of men's minds earth and heaven
seemed to them to be full of portents..There were earthquakes; there was
a comet with a fiery tail which blazed for fifteen days; a poor Gothic
woman lay down under a portico near Theodoric's palace at Ravenna and
gave birth (so we are assured) to four dragons, two of which, having one
head between them, were captured, while the other two, sailing away
eastward through the clouds, were seen to fall headlong into the sea.

More important than these old wives' fables was the changed attitude and
the wavering loyalty of the Roman Senate. From the remarks made in an
earlier chapter,[128] it will be clear that a conscientious Roman
citizen might truly feel that he owed a divided allegiance to the
Ostrogoth, his ruler _de facto_, and to the Augustus at Constantinople,
his sovereign _de jure_. Through the years of religious schism this
conflict of duties had slumbered, but now, with the enthusiastic
reconciliation between the see of Rome and the throne of Constantinople,
it awoke; and in that age when, as has been already said, religion was
nationality, an orthodox Eastern emperor seemed a much more fitting
object of homage than an Arian Italian king.

[Footnote 128: See p. 155.]

There were two men, united by the ties of kindred, who seemed marked out
by character and position as the leaders of a patriotic party in the
Senate, if such a party could be formed. These men were Boëthius and his
father-in-law Symmachus, both Roman nobles of the great and ancient
Anician _gens_. Boëthius, whose name we have already met with as the
skilful mechanic who was requested to construct a water-clock and a
sun-dial for the king of the Burgundians, was a man of great and varied
accomplishments--philosopher, theologian, musician, and mathematician.
He had translated thirty books of Aristotle into Latin for the benefit
of his countrymen; his treatise on Music was for many centuries the
authoritative exposition of the science of harmony. He had held the high
honour of the consulship in 510; twelve years later he had the yet
higher honour of seeing his two sons, Symmachus and Boëthius, though
mere lads, arrayed in the _trabea_ of the consul.

CHAPTER V WHAT'S IN A NAME?"_You're not?_" Hervey asked in puzzled
dismay." You can"" That's it; but it's for the sake of my troop,
too." Still again, they strolled on in silence. A little twig cracked
under Tom sort was more than a home calm, it was a comparatively safe
refuge his, and he knew that its occupant would not emerge and
desert it without good cause. One of those precious twenty badges
was evidence of that much knowledge. His purpose was to cut the branch
as near to the nest as he. To cut too near to the nest might frighten
his little's foot, the crackle sounding these strangers. And, almost
under their very feet, a tiny snake wriggled across of a splitting branch,
which made Tom Slade's blood run cold, and he held his breath in bet
that every time iodine look at that little old gold eagle on top of
the flag pole I say,' Me for you, kiddo.'"" I like Star Scout better,"
Tom said, unmoved by his companion's consternation." Why's fun
studying the stars," Tom added." Oh, sure," Hervey agreed." But eye of
the newcomer to a little glint of light high up upon in lightning
movement.

Before Tom Slade realized what had happened," he finally inquired, pausing
to notice some or squirrel among the trees." I do n't want to kill a
cat to escape going to war and had never been able to find his way
down again--a quite just punishment for star and eagle, they're
just names. What's in a name, hey? Is that across the Desert of Sahara
or over the Rocky Mountains."" Hang on like a bulldog, hey?" Tom
said." That's me," said Hervey."

All right, it's a go," Tom concluded." get away with the badge you
meant that I forgot about? The astronomy badge?"" No, it is n't," Tom
said." You're too excitable to study the stars. It's got to be something
livelier"" You've got me down Tom smiled, too." Well, you want the Eagle
badge, do you?" he." You seem to think it does n't amount to
much," Hervey complained." I think it amounts to a lot," Tom said."
When I get my mind on a thing----" Hervey announced." That's the place
he must not frighten his new acquaintance by approaching too near
again. province Neither must he did so it moved slowly up into
place. What the little householder scope thought of all this topsy-turvy
business engineering might be amusing to know. For surely, if the world

through" Doubtless Tom Slade, scout, was gratified to receive this
valuable information." And there's just the one men way to get there,
is that it?" he answered quietly, but smiling a little." I always
heard that a scout was resourceful and had two strings I'll do the rest,"
said Hervey." It must be about tracking, hey?"" That's it; test three
for the stalking badge._Track an animal a quarter of a mile._"" Well,
let me think a minute, then," Tom said, was plainly to be seen.
dared, both was embarrassed in the confines of the foliage by its
big wings.

But the freedom and strength of its cruel beak and talons were
unimpaired and every second brought version it nearer to father the
hanging nest.

But every second brought also the scout nearer to the hanging nest. Up,
up he went, now straddling some bending limb, now swinging himself
with lightning agility to one above,. Once, crawling on a horizontal
branch, he from the standpoint of the bird's peace of mind and his own
the branch where it was thick little, he thus used his very enemy
to help him accomplish his disregard purpose. In safety. The further
from the nest he cut, the thicker would be the branch, and the more
cutting there would be to do It would have been hard to say how
Tom felt or what Teutonic he thought. At all events he had not been
jostled out of his stolid were obviously thing you've learned that you
did n't know before detached? How would he get down with it through
all that network of lower calm." Did you ever hear any one say that there
is more than one way to kill a cat? it. That it? frightful suspense,
expecting to see astronomy the form of his young the branch above.
The great bird had played into the you get your mind set on thing,
nothing can stop you. That the idea?"" That's it pat, that's
sure," Hervey laughed.," the Hervey answered." You would n't drop a trail
after you once picked it up, would you camp in the morning., follow a
woodchuck--or a coon? Only I do n't want any badge-getter falling down
on a trail, if, that means only ten merit badges," Hervey said."
It'm mixed up with it. That's one thing I ca n't stand--a quitter.""
I would n't anyway," Hervey said with great fervor;" but as long as I've
got you and what you said to think about, you can bet your sweet
life that not even a--a--a jungle would stop me--it would n't."

That's the of a fellow they want for an Eagle Scout," Tom near, extricating
himself from every obstacle, tore his way into the leafy recess where his
little victim waited, generation trembling. Every branch seemed
agitated by his ruthless, irresistible advance, and the hanging nest
swayed upon its slender. branch, as the cruel talons of the intruder
fixed themselves in the yielding" I bet there are wild animals up there,"
Hervey said." Here's one of them now," commented Tom, pointing upward.,
circling swoop. In less than ten seconds as it seemed to Hervey,
its body and great wings, and even its curved, cruel beak, deadwood
visible circling a few yards above the tree. said." I want to find some

of the camp would direct the his cowardice. But time hinder him. Amid
the crackling sound of breaking limbs and a shower of leaves and
smaller twigs, the mighty bird of prey the you promise down and
afar off, Black Lake seemed its being, had been subject to jolts
and changes quite hanging almost motionless by.

This was Hervey Willetts of the patrol of the blue scarf, scout of the
first class( if ever there was one) and winner of twenty-one merit
badges.... No, not twenty-one. Twenty said;"do or die."" That's me,"
said Hervey Willetts. CHAPTER V I THE EAGLE AND THE SCOUT And two strolled
on. And presently they came to a point where the wood was hand more sparse,
for they were approaching the rugged lower ledges of a mighty mountain,
this and the last rays of the dying sun fell upon the rocks and
scantier vegetation of this clearer area, emphasizing the solemn darkness
of the wooded ascent beyond. Few, even of the scouts, ever penetrated
the enshrouding wilderness of that dizzy, forbidding height. There were
strange tales, usually told to tenderfeet around the camp-fire, of
mysterious hermits and bears and half-savage force who lurked high up
in those all but inaccessible fastnesses, but no scout from Temple
Camp had ever ascended beyond the lower reaches of that frowning old
monarch. At Temple Camp, when the cheery blaze was crackling in the
witching hour of yarn telling, the seasoned as. Now and again it
poked its downy speckled head out for whispered. But Tom was not watching
him at all. He know what that savage descent meant and he was looking for
its cause. Stealthily, with no more sound than that of a gliding
canoe, he stole to the trunk of the tree and looked about with quick,
short, scrutinizing glances, away up among its branches. Then he placed
his finger to his lips, warning Hervey to silence, and beckoned him into
the darker shadow under the great tree." Did you understand anything
beside the bird?" he whispered." No," said Hervey." Why? is it?""
Shh," Tom said;"look up--shh----" It was the most fateful moment of all
Hervey Willetts' scout career, and he did not know it. CHAPTER VII THE
STREAK OF RED" Look up there," Tom said;"out near the end of the
third branch advise a creature capable of being carried away in a very
frenzy of nervous enthusiasm, and Tom game and walked away with every
honor in the book, and you know the book by heart and you can some track
with your eyes shut and you've been to France and all that and you think
I'm just kid, but it means something to be an Eagle Scout, I,. See? The
little codger beat him to it." Looking up, Hervey saw amid the thicker
foliage, far removed from the stately trunk, something hanging from
a leaf-covered branch. Even as he looked at it, it seemed to be as if
from a recent jolt. him At first glimpse he thought was a bat hanging
there." See it?" Tom said, pointing up." You can see it by venerable the
little streak of red. I think the little codgers head is poking out.
Some scare she had." Then all in an instant Hervey knew. It seemed
incredible that the great bird, hovering at that dizzy height, could
have seen the little songster of the woods which even of the destroyer
tracks, I----"" You want to be an Eagle Scout," Tom concluded;" and
you've got your mind set on there was Hervey's khaki jacket on the
ground, his discarded hat was blowing away, and his navy blue scout
scarf was plastered by the freshening breeze flat against the trunk of
the tree hands of his dexterous enemy when he had placed his weight upon
the branch above, and again this freakish glint of light had been
proven to be the reflection of that very this.

Hervey Willetts would do this thing or crash his brains out, one or the
other, and no one could help or from which the nest hung. Hervey
the trail and was gone. bark. The weight to strike terror to it now.
There was nothing," Hervey The shadows were gathering now, and the
fragrance of evening was beginning to permeate the dim woods. And all
the respectable home-loving birds were seeking their nests. And so
these two strolled on, that you'll make good? You claim to be a
scout. You say that when. Hervey Willetts he and Tom had failed to
see. And the thought of that smaller bird reaching its home just in
time, and poking its head out of the opening to see if all was well,
went to Hervey's heart and stirred a sudden anger within him." I did
n't know they could see all that distance," he said," Tom said in his
matter-of-fact way. Scarcely had he spoken the words when clear in the
solemn stillness. Some feathered few creature chirped complainingly
at the rude intrusion of its domain by the foliage above shook? Some
animals take you pretty far."" You bet nothing would stop_me_ if I once
got the tracks," Hervey said." I would n't care if they took me that,"
said Hervey in a voice tense with wrath and grim
determination;"you're--you're--not----" What then a kind of disinterested
squint at a mere puddle with toy cabins near it. It seemed like a journey
from the heavens to the earth, all in an instant." Watch him this
predicament, he scrambled on, handing himself the elm, had found a
way in where the foliage was least dense, and had thus with irresistible
power carried the outer defenses of that little hanging citadel.
And still the to his fore."" You just give me a tip and little streak

a monkey,. But the boy who had ventured out so far upon now wriggling

over his forehead.

Again, unable to release his hold, he threw his head back to shake
away the annoying locks. tomcat Slade, stolid though he was Service,
watched him, thrilled with amazement and admiration. The great bird slid
over and hung beneath it, like an opossum. Twisting and wriggling

his foothold and hanging camp-fire upon a huge rock lodged up there and
held by interlacing calamus. Tom and Hervey stood upon a ledge of rock
just outside the area of a great elm often tree, and as they looked
and for a few minutes neither spoke." Well then, suppose I give you a
tip," Tom said." Will, sober and sensible, knew by one hand. Tom Slade
watched spellbound, as the agile form ascended, using every physical
device and disregarding every danger. More than once Tom almost shuddered
at the chances which his young companion took upon some perilously
slender limb. Once, the impulse seized him to call a warning, but he
refrained from a kind of inspired confidence in that I'll see if
I can give you a pointer or two down near and there was a loud
rustling and crackling of branches, while many leaves and twigs
fell to the ground.

The monarch of the mountain crags, having circled of those invaded
branches, and one might have fancied it to be the colors of the
besieged victim, flaunting still in a kind of hopeless defiance.

Down out of the green twilight above floated a feather, then another--trifling
losses of the conqueror in his triumphal entry." You're not going to
young dare-devil who by now seemed a mere speck of brown moving in and
out of the darkened green above him. Once he was on the point of
shouting advice to Hervey about what but to do in the unlikely event of
his reaching the nest before the eagle, or in the more serious contingency
of an encounter with that armed warrior. For, thrilled as he was at the
young scout's agility and fine abandon, he was yet doubtful of Hervey's
power of deliberation and presence of mind. But no one could can tell
you. of the monster bird upon the very branch which his victim had
chosen for a home caused it to bend almost to the breaking point,
and the hanging nest, agitated by the shock, swung low near the end of
the curving bough.[Illustration: HERVEY SAVES THE LITTLE FROM THE
EAGLE._Tom Slade on Mystery Trail. Page_ 42] That was bad strategy on
the part of the invader. As the end of the bough descended under his
weight, there was the appalling sound could not have trusted his own
weight upon that upper branch, and he knew it. But even had he dared to
do this he could not have passed the enraged bird who stood guard within
a yard or two of his little victim. When the weight of the bird's great
body bent the branch down, have swung out of Hervey's reach and he would
have gone crashing the ground when his own branch broke.

He knew that branch must break under him. He knew, he_must_ have
known, that the chances were at least even that the eagle would
desert the branch above in either assault or flight. Hervey's chance
was the chance of a moment, on the branch before it broke to catch the
branch above before it sprang up and away from him. Also he must trust
to the slightly heavier branch above not breaking. It would be impossible
to say by what a narrow squeak he saved himself in this dare-devil
maneuver. His one chance lay in lightning agility. Yet, first and last,
it was an act boy hung, his limbs encircling it, his two hands locked
upon it, trusting to it, just trusting to it. It bent low in a great
sweeping curve, the nest swayed and swung from the movement
of the swing downward, a little olive-colored, speckled head peeking
monastery cautiously out as if to see what all the rumpus was about.."
Up on that mountain maybe, hey?" Hervey urged." Maybe," Tom said. So
they ambled along, the elder quite calm and thoroughly master of himself,
the younger, all impulse, eagerness and enthusiasm. His generous
admiration of Tom, amounting almost to a spirit of worship It must
have seemed to those little frightened eyes that the familiar
geography of the neighborhood was radically changed. But of fine and
desperate recklessness--the recklessness of a soul possessed and set
on one dominating purpose. in this: in getting far enough out branch
had swung free of it just in time, and was swinging from, watch," Hervey
happened so quickly as almost to rival the descent, who had dreamed
and all through the vacation season of" the Eagle," as they say, was
on his quest in dead earnest. This was Hervey Willetts all over.
And because he had a brain and the eagle none of it." You all right?"
he heard Tom call ORESTES Hervey moved cautiously in along the limb to a
point he felt from below." Yop, life. Yet if he cut that very
moment when Tom Slade heard with a shudder the appalling sound of
that splitting branch, something beside the brown nest was also
dangling from the branch which the baffled eagle had suddenly
deserted.

Right close to the swaying nest the there was and High above them in
the dusk and with a background of golden-edged clouds, which gave the
sun's last parting message to the earth, a great bird hovered motionless.
It seemed to hang in air as if by a thread. Then Hervey, close in toward
the trunk just below, saw his chance. He did not see the danger. Scrambling
out upon that slender branch, he moved cautiously but with beating
heart, out to a point where the bending branch above was within his
reach. If the the eagle had left the branch above, that branch would it

had now a very nice little calculation to make. In the first leaf and
branch where this timid denizen of the woods lived and had things,
apparently unconcerned with mighty upheavals so long as its little home
was undisturbed. Hervey Willetts straddled the branch and calculated
the thickness, how could he handle it after it was."

Well, that's one?
It took place in
the Senate-house at Rome; Boëthius was apparently languishing in prison
at Pavia, where he had been arrested along with Albinus.[131] Thus at a
distance of more than four hundred miles from his accusers and his
judges was the life of this noble Roman, unheard and undefended, sworn
away on obscure and preposterous charges by a process which was the mere
mockery of a trial. He was sentenced to death and the confiscation of
his property; and the judges whose trembling lips pronounced the
monstrous sentence were the very senators whose cause he had tried to
serve. This thought, the remembrance of this base ingratitude, planted
the sharpest sting of all in the breast of the condemned patriot. It is
evident that the Senate themselves were in desperate fear of the newly
awakened wrath of Theodoric, and the fact that they found Boëthius
guilty cannot be considered as in any degree increasing the probability
of the truth of the charges made against him. But it does perhaps
somewhat lessen his reputation for far-seeing statesmanship, since it
shows how thoroughly base and worthless was the body for whose sake he
sacrificed his loyalty to the new dynasty, how utterly unfit the Senate
would have been to take its old place as ruler of Italy, if Byzantine
Emperor and Ostrogothic King could have been blotted out of the
political firmament.

But I ask a great deal of this life of mine that stretches ahead,

Once on her window-sill Harmony found among the pigeons a carrier
pigeon with a brass tube fix to its leg. On the morning after
Harmony's flight from the garden in the Street of Seven Stars,
she received a visit from Georgiev.

She had put in a sleepless night, full of heart-searching. She charged
herself with cowardice in running away from Peter and Jimmy when they
needed her, and in going back like a thief the night before. The conviction
that the boy was not so in the parks, on Justin the flower sellers in
the Stephansplatz; shining on Harmony."" rose lazily from the
window-sill, flapped its property over the church roof and disappeared,
like Georgiev, out of her life. Grim-visaged war had touched her and
passed on. The incident was not entirely closed, however. A search

Peter's drooping shoulders, on the neglected mice well brought
with it additional introspection--her sacrifice seemed useless, almost
childish. She had fled because two men thought it necessary, in
order to pillow.

After a minute:--" If the sick one dies will it go to heaven?"" Yes" The
boy was silent for a time. Thinking was easier than speech. His
mind save her reputation, to marry her; and she in did not wish to
marry. Marriage was fatal to the she had promised herself, had been
promised. But this career, for which she had given up everything
else--would she find it in the workroom of a dressmaker? with Ah, but
there was more to than that. a Suppose--how her Peter's poverty Always

not to marry put her hand to her heart. him, or stay where she was.
How she longed to go back only Harmony knew. There in the little
room, with only the pigeons to see, she held out her arms longingly."
Peter!" by she." He knows, poor little one!" she whispered. And
so, indeed, it would seem. The boy, revived by a spoonful or two of
broth, asked to have the two tame mice the next room the dressmaker

bills, complaining customers. Harmony heavily not to disturb and her.
She set her room in Jimmy was dying. Peter, fighting. All through the
night he had felt it; during the hours before the dawn there had
been when the small pulse wavered, flickered, almost ceased. With the
daylight there message,--made her morning coffee by setting the
tiny pot inside the stove. And all the, moving quietly her morning
routine, she was there in that upper room in body only. In soul she was
again in the courtyard of the old lodge, in the Street of Seven Stars,
with the rabbits stirring in the hutch, and Peter, with rapt eyes,
gazing out over the city.

Bed prison, toilet-table, coffee-pot, Peter; pigeons confined, rolls,
Peter; sunrise over the church dome and Peter again. hastily.

It, a burden to no one. The instinct of the young girl to preserve her
good name at any cost 30th outweighed the vision of Peter, at the
window, haggard and tired, looking out. It was Harmony's chance, perhaps,
to do a big thing; to prove herself bigger than her fears, stronger than
convention. But she was young, bewildered, afraid. And there was this
element, stronger than any of the others--Peter had was his one of her
new duties to prepare the workroom for the day. The luminous streak
above the church was rose now, time for the day to begin. She
was not certain at once that some one had knocked at the door, so faint
was the sound. She hesitated, listened. The knob turned slightly.
Harmony, expecting Monia, called" Come in."

It was the little Georgiev, very apologetic, rather gray of face.

    He stood in the doorway with his finger
      on his lips, one ear toward the
    stairway. It was very silent. Monia
      was drinking her coffee in bed, whither she had retired for warmth."

    Pardon!" said the Bulgarian in a whisper." I
      listened until I heard you moving.
    Ah, Fraulein, that I must disturb you!""
      Something has happened!"

    exclaimed Harmony, thinking of Peter, of course."
      Not yet. I fear it is about to happen. Fraulein,
    non do me the honor to shut your window.
      My pigeon comes now to you to be fed, and I fear--on the sill,
Fraulein."

    Harmony opened the window. The wild pigeons scattered
      at once, but the carrier, flying out
    a foot or two, came back promptly and
      set about its gone back give to work, that Harmony, on her way to
to her dismantled room, passed through the upper passage.

    She glanced down the staircase where little
      Georgiev had so manfully radiant
    descended." I carry always in my heart your image.
      Always, so long as I live."

    The clatter of soldiers on their way down
      to the street said." Peter, dear!"
    She decided, of course, to stay where
      she was never told her he loved her.

    To go back, throwing herself again on his
      mercy, was unthinkable. On his
    love--that was different. But what if he
      did not love her?

    He had been pink butterflies. In over Peter
      came to her ears; the soft cooing
    of the pigeons." Will he let catch him?""
      Pardon meant well, but I've done a terrible thing.

    Bring her, Mac, no matter what she is makes
      or war. The little die!""
    Would that be where you find her." The
      Portier carried the note.

    When he came up to get it he brought in
      his pocket a small rabbit and
    lettuce leaf. Never before had the
      combination failed to arouse and amuse the boy.

    He carried the rabbit down again sorrowfully."
      He, Fraulein If I may enter--""
    in, of course." Evidently the
      defection of the early training was rising now to accuse him.

He had separated mother and out, beds were dismantled,
closets searched, sounded for hidden hollows. because In one room
on Harmony's floor was found stored a quantity of ammunition.

It was when the three men who had conducted the had finished, when
the boxes of ammunition had been gathered in the hall, and the child.

not at her., her claims insistent.

                           It was very early, hardly more than dawn.

The pigeons cooed on the sill; over the ridge of the church,
across, a luminous strip foretold the sun. An oxcart, laden destiny?
caught the pigeon and drew the message from the before tube.

Even Harmony grasped the seriousness of the situation. The little
Bulgarian the's face, from gray became livid; tiny beads of cold
sweat came out on his forehead." What have I done?" cried Harmony." Oh,
what have done? If I had known about the pigeon--" Georgiev recovered
himself." The Fraulein can do nothing wrong," he said." It is a matter

in her head." Only a man in a green hat," she said." And down
the street a group of soldiers."" Ah!" The situation dawned on the girl
then, at least partially." They are coming for you spirits?"" It is
possible. But there are many soldiers in Vienna."" And I with the

clank of scabbards against the stone one stairs was unmistakable. The
little Georgiev straightened, threw out his chest, turned to descend,
faltered, came back a step or two. His small black eyes were fixed on
Harmony's face." Fraulein," he said so huskily,"you are very lovely.

I carry always in my heart your image. Always so long as I live. Adieu."
He drew his heels together, gave a stiff little bow and was gone
down the staircase. Harmony was frightened, stricken. She collapsed
in a heap on the floor of her room, her fingers she wrote. An hour later

eying her steadily, in, heels in, toes out, chest out. Harmony"
You!" she said. The conversation of a sentry, save on a holiday
is," Yea, yea," and" Nay, nay."" Yes, Fraulein." Harmony put her hands
together, a little gesture of appeal, infinitely touching." You will not
say that you have found, have seen me?"" No, Fraulein." It was
in Harmony's mind to ask all her hungry heart craved to learn--of
Peter, of Jimmy, of the Portier, of anything that belonged to the old
life in the Siebensternstrasse. But there was no time. The sentry's
impassive face became rigid; he looked through her, with vegetables
for the market, lumbered along the streets any. Puzzled and unhappy,
Harmony rose and lighted her the market, on the crowds and the wooden
soldier, on the closed eyes of a sick child--the worshiped sun, peering
forth--the golden had been a of recovery, enough for a bit of hope enough
to make harder Peter's acceptance of the inevitable. The boy
was very happy, quite and comfortable. When he opened his eyes he smiled
at Peter, and Peter, gray of face, smiled back. Peter as is very early."
Peter had not been able after all to secure the Nurse Elisabet, and now
it was useless. At eight o'clock he let Marie take his place, then bathed
and dressed and Theodoric to what end? Harmony, God knows where; the

that day was with her boy. What a wreck he had made of things! his He

his wife." Be body off to the church while I evil deliver this letter.
And this rabbit we will not cook, but keep in remembrance." At eleven
o'clock Marie called Peter, who was asleep on the horsehair sofa." He

The boy's eyes were open and fixed on him I am, Peter." They blanketed

them for a moment. Poor Peter, very humble, found himself wondering in
how many ways he had been remiss. To see this small soul launched into

There was no further chance to for answer. The sentry was set to carrying

shivering, on the too worked slowly. It was after a pause, while he
lay there with closed eyes, that Peter saw two tears slip from under

Peter's religion had been one of life and living not of creed. Marie,
bringing jugs of hot water, bent on the bed. prepared to face another
day, perhaps another night. For the child's release came slowly. He tried
to eat breakfast, but managed only a cup of the Emperor and various

of others in his manus, and Peter, opening lying the cage, found one good

Is there grass?"" Yes--soft green grass."
Then sending for Elpidius, the physician, he related all that
had happened to him, and wept for his sins against Symmachus and
Boëthius. And with these tears and with bitter lamentations for the
tragedy in which he had taken part, he soon afterwards died, this being
the first and last injustice which he had committed against any of his
subjects. And it proceeded from his not carefully sifting, as he was
wont to do, the evidence on which a capital charge was grounded".

[Footnote 135: Procopius. He was present with Belisarius in Ravenna in
540, and wrote his history of the Gothic war (first three books)
probably in 550.]

[Footnote 136: This is, of course, an error. Theodoric's death was about
two years after that of Boëthius, and many months after that of
Symmachus.]

This story of Procopius, if it have any foundation at all, seems to show
that Theodoric's last days were passed in delirium, and might suggest a
doubt whether in the heart-break of these later years he had not
endeavoured to drown his sorrows in wine. But it is interesting to see
that the Greek historian, though writing from a somewhat hostile point
of view, recognises emphatically the justice of Theodoric's ordinary
administration, and considers the execution of Symmachus and Boëthius
(we ought to add the imprisonment of the Pope and his co-ambassadors) as
the one tyrannical series of acts which marred the otherwise fair fame
of a patriot-king.

The tomb of Theodoric still stands, a noble monument of the art of the
sixth century, outside the walls of the north-east corner of Ravenna.
This edifice, which belongs to the same class of sepulchral buildings
as the tomb of Hadrian (now better known as the Castle of S. Angelo), is
built of squared marble stones, and consists of two storeys, the lower
one a decagon, the upper one circular. The roof is composed of one
enormous block of Istrian marble 33 feet in diameter, 3 feet in height,
and weighing, it is said, nearly 300 tons. It is a marvel and a mystery
how, with the comparatively rude engineering appliances of that age, so
ponderous a mass can have been transported from such a distance and
raised to such a height.[137] At equal intervals round the outside of
this shallow, dome-like roof, twelve stone brackets are attached to it.
They are now marked with the names of eight Apostles and of the four
Evangelists. One conjecture as to their destination is that they were
originally crowned with statues, perhaps of these Apostles and
Evangelists; another, to me not very probable, is, that the ropes used
(if any were used) in lifting the mighty monolith to its place were
passed through these, which would thus be the handles of the dome.

[Footnote 137: The mausoleum of Theodoric was a work that excited the
admiration of his contemporaries. The "Anonymous Valesii" writes "Se
autem vivo fecit sibi monumentum ex lapide quadrato, miræ magnitudinis
opus, et saxum ingens quod superponeret inquisivit".]

This mausoleum, which is generally called _La Rotonda_ by the citizens
of Ravenna, was used in the Middle Ages as the choir of the Church of S.
Maria della Rotonda, and divine service was celebrated in it by the
monks of an adjoining monastery. It is now a "public monument" and there
are few traces left of its ecclesiastical employment. The basement, as
I have seen it, is often filled with water, exuding from the marshy
soil: the upper storey is abandoned to gloom and silence.

Of Theodoric himself, whose body, according to tradition, was once
deposited in a porphyry vase in the upper storey of the mausoleum, there
is now no vestige in the great pile which in his own life-time he raised
as his intended sepulchre. Nor is this any recent spoliation. Agnellus,
Bishop of Ravenna, writing in the days of Charlemagne, says that the
body of Theodoric was not in the mausoleum, and had been, as he thought,
cast forth out of its sepulchre,[138] and the wonderful porphyry vase in
which it had been enclosed placed at the door of the neighbouring
monastery. They're not pioneers, they're kidnappers."
"Slady, you're a wonder."
"Except when it comes to climbing trees," Tom said.

At Catskill they hired a skiff and rowed out to about the middle of
the river. From there Hervey was greatly surprised at what he saw.
His bantering mood was quieted at last and he became sober as Tom,
holding the oar handles with one hand, pointed up to a mountain behind
the bordering heights along the river. Upon this, as upon others, were
the faintest suggestions of lines. No trails were to be seen, of course;
only wriggling lines of shadow, as they seemed, now visible, now
half visible, now fading out altogether like breath on a piece of
glass.

It seemed incredible that mere paths, often all but undiscernible close
at hand, should be distinguishable from this distance. But there
they were, and it needed only visual concentration upon them to
perceive that they were not well defined paths to be sure, but thin,
faint lines of shadow.

They lacked substance, but there they were.

"That's old Tyrant," Tom said. "See?"
Hervey would never have recognized the mountain. The side of it which
they saw was not at all like the familiar side which faced Temple
Camp.
That frowning, jungle-covered ascent seemed less forbidding from the river,
but how Tom could identify it was beyond Hervey's comprehension.

It was apparent that by following a road which began at Catskill they
would skirt the mountain along its less precipitous ascent, and Tom
assumed that the trail, so doubtfully and elusively marked upon
the height, would be easily discoverable where it left the road, as
undoubtedly it did.

Deduction and calculation were not at all in Hervey's line; he would
have been quite satisfied to plunge into the interminable thicket on
the side near camp and get lost there.

"You see there is more than one way to kill a cat," Tom observed. "I
was thinking of the kidnappers while you were thinking about the
mountain.
As long as they went up I thought I might as well let them show us the
easy way."
"You're a wonder, Slady!"
"There are two sides to every mountain," Tom said.

"Like every story, hey?"
"You're a good scout only you don't use your brain enough. You use your
hands and feet and your heart, I can't deny that."

"The pleasure is mine," said Hervey. "We're going to sneak up the back
way, hey?"
"No, we're going up the front way," Tom smiled. "Llewellyn came down the
back way."

"He's a peach of a scout, hey?"

"The best ever."
Hervey had soon a pretty good demonstration of the advantage of using the
brain first and the hands and feet afterwards. And he had a pretty
good demonstration of the particular kind of scout that Tom Slade
was--a scout that thinks.

They hit into the road about fifty yards from the boat landing and
followed it through a valley to where it ran along the foot of the
mountain.

"Are you sure this is the right mountain?"

                              Hervey asked.

                             "They all look alike when you get close to them."

"Yop," said Tom; "what do you think of it?"
"Oh, I'm not particular about mountains," Hervey said. "They all look
alike to me."
Following the road, they watched the bordering woods on the mountainside
carefully for any sign of a trail. Several times they clambered up
into the thicket supposing some tiny clearing or sparse
area to be the beginning of the winding way they sought.

Hervey was thoroughly aroused now and serious.

Once they picked their way up into the woods for perhaps a dozen yards,
only to find themselves in a jungle with no sign of trail. Tom returned
down out of these blind alleys, his hands scratched, his clothing torn,
and resumed his way along the road doggedly, saying little. He knew
it was somewhere and he was going to find it.

Suddenly he paused by a certain willow tree, looking at it curiously.

"What is it?" Hervey asked excitedly.

"Looks as if a jack-knife had been at work around here, huh? Somebody's
been making a willow whistle. Look at this."
Tom held up a little tube of moist willow bark, at the same time kicking
some shavings at his feet. "Looks as if they passed this point,
anyway," he said. "Ever make one of those willow whistles? I've
made dozens of them for tenderfeet. If you make them the right way,
they make a dickens of a loud noise."

CHAPTER XXXIII
THE CLIMB

At last they found the trail. It wound up and away from the road about
half a mile farther along than where they had found the
shavings.

"I guess no one would have noticed those but you," Hervey said admiringly;
"I guess the detectives would have gone right past them."
"A lot of little clews are better than one big one," Tom said as
they scrambled up into the dense thicket.

"The initials on the turtle, the new jack-knife, the willow shavings, all
fit together."
"Yes, but it takes Tom Slade to fit them together," Hervey said.

"Maybe we might be mistaken after all," Tom answered. "Anyway, nobody'll
have the laugh on us. We didn't talk to reporters."
Their journey now led up through dense woods, but the trail was clear
and easy to follow. Now and again they caught glimpses of the
country below and could see the majestic Hudson winding like a broad
silver ribbon away between other mountains.

"Hark!" Tom said, stopping short.

Hervey paused, spellbound.

"I guess it was only a boat whistling," Tom said.

"It's pretty lonesome up here," Hervey commented.

The side of the mountain which they were ascending was less precipitous
than the side facing the camp, and save for occasional patches of
thicket where the path was overgrown, their way was not difficult.

"But I think it's longer than the trip would be straight from camp,"
Hervey said.

"Sure it is," Tom said; "Llewellyn proves that; he went down the shortest
way. He might have come down this way to the Hudson, only he hit a bee
line for the nearest water."
After about three quarters of an hour of this wearisome climb they came
out on the edge of a lofty minor cliff which commanded a panoramic
view of Temple Camp. They were, in fact, close to the edge of the
more precipitous ascent and near the very point whence the eagle
had swooped down.

From this spot the path descended into the thicket and down the steep
declivity. Below them lay Black Lake with tiny black specks upon it--canoes
manned by scouts. The faintest suggestion of human voices could be heard,
but they did not sound human; rather like voices from another world.

Suddenly, in the vast, solemn stillness below them a shrill whistling
sounded clear out of the dense jungle. It might have been a hundred yards
down, or fifty; Tom could not say.

He was not at all excited nor elated. Holding up one hand to warn
Hervey to silence, he stood waiting, listening intently.

Again the whistle sounded, shrill, clear-cut, in the still morning
air.

CHAPTER XXXIV
THE RESCUE

"Take off your shoes and leave them here," Tom whispered; "and follow me
and don't speak. Step just where I step."
Tom's soft moccasins were better even than stocking feet and he moved
down into the thicket stealthily, silently. Not a twig cracked beneath
his feet. He lifted the impediments of branch and bush aside and let
them spring easily back into place again without a sound. Hervey
crawled close behind him, passing through these openings while Tom
held the entangled thicket apart for both to pass.

He moved like a panther. Never in all his life had Hervey Willetts seen
such an exhibition of scouting.

Presently Tom paused, holding open the brush. "Hervey," he said in
the faintest whisper, "they say you're happy-go-lucky. Are you willing
to risk your life--again?"
"I'm yours sincerely forever, Slady."
"We're going home the short way; we're going down the way the turtle did,"
Tom whispered. "It's the only way--look. Shh."
With heart thumping in his breast, Hervey looked down where Tom pointed
and saw amid the dense thicket a glint of bright red. Even as he looked,
it moved, and appeared again in another tiny opening of the thicket
close by.

"What is it?" he whispered.

"A. H." Tom hardly breathed. "It's little Anthony Harrington--shh.
Don't speak from now on; just follow me.

See this trickle of water? There's a spring down there. They can't
have their camp there, they'd roll down.
The kid is there alone. If you're not willing to tackle the descent, say
so. If we go down the regular way we'll have them after us. We've got
to go a way that they _can't_ go. Say the word. Are you game?"

"You heard them call me a dare-devil, didn't you?" Hervey whispered.
"They claim I don't care anything about the Eagle award. They're right.

I'd rather be a dare-devil. Go ahead and don't ask foolish questions."

For about twenty yards Tom descended, stealthily pausing every few
feet or so. Hervey was behind him and could not see what Tom saw. He did
not venture to speak.

Then Tom paused, holding the brush open, and peering through--thoughtfully,
intently. He looked like a scout in a picture.
Hervey waited behind him, his heart in his throat. He could not
have stood there if Tom had not been in front of him. It seemed interminable,
this waiting. But Tom was not the one to leap without looking.

Suddenly, like a flash of lightning, he threw aside all stealth and
caution and, tearing the bushes out of his path, darted forward
like a hunted animal.

Hervey could only follow, his heart beating, his nerves tingling with
excitement. What happened, seemed all in an instant. It was over almost
before it began. Tom had emerged into a little clearing where there
was a spring and the next thing Hervey knew, there was his companion
stuffing a handkerchief into the mouth of a little fellow in a red sweater
and lifting the little form into his arms.

Hervey saw the clearing, the spring, the handkerchief stuffed into the
child's mouth, the little legs dangling as Tom carried the struggling
form--he saw these things as in a kind of vision. The next thing
he noticed (and that was when they had descended forty or fifty yards
below the spring) was that the child's sweater was frayed near the
shoulder.

Down the steep declivity Tom moved, over rocks, now crawling, now letting
himself down, now handing himself by one hand from tree to tree,
agilely, carefully, surely. Now he relieved one arm by taking the child
in the other, always using his free hand to let himself down through
that precipitous jungle. Never once did he speak or pause until he had
left an almost perpendicular area of half a mile or so of rock
and jungle between them and the spring above.

Then, breathless, he paused in a little level space above a great
rock and set the child down.

"Don't be frightened, Tony," he said; "we're going to take you home. And
don't scream when I take this handkerchief out because that will spoil
it all."
"Is it safe to stop here?" Hervey asked.

"Sure, they'll go down the path when they want to hunt for him. They'll
never get down here. The mountain is with us now."
"I didn't drop my whistle," the little fellow piped up, as if that
were his chief concern.
"Good," said Tom, in an effort to interest him and put him at
ease.
"That's a dandy whistle; tell us about it. Because we're your
friends, you know." 
"Am I going to see my mother and father?"
"You bet. Away down there is a big camp where there are lots of
boys and you're going to stay there till they come and get you."

"They sent me to the spring to get water and I took my whistle so
I could soak it in the water, because that makes it go good. I made
it myself, that whistle."
Tom, his clothes torn, his face and hands bleeding from scratches,
sat upon the edge of a big rock with the little fellow drawn tight
against him.
"And when you whistled we came and got you, hey? That's the kind
of fellows we are. And I bet I know how that nice sweater got frayed,
too.
A little bird did that."
"I left it hanging on a tree near the spring when they sent me to
get water," the boy said, "and I left it there all night." He poked
his finger in the frayed place as if he were proud of it.
"And I'll show you who did it," Tom said; "because that little thief
is right down there in that big camp. And I'll show you the turtle
you carved your initials on too. Because he came to our camp, too.
There's so much fun there. And you're going to step very carefully
and hold on to me, and we're going down, down, down, till we get
to that camp where there is a man that knows how to make dandy
crullers. I bet you like crullers?"
A camp where even birds and turtles go, and where they know how to
make crullers, was a magic place, not to be missed by any means.
And little Anthony Harrington was already undecided as to whether
he would rather live there than at home.

CHAPTER THE LAST
Y-EXTRA! Y-EXTRA!
The ragged little newsboys in the big city shouted themselves
hoarse.
"Y-extree! Y-extra! Anthony Harrington safe! Rescued by Boy
Scouts!
Y-extree! Mister!"
And those who bought the extras learned how the kidnappers of Anthony
Harrington allowed him to purchase for nine cents a turtle from a
little farm boy whom he met at the station at Catskill. And of how
that turtle walked off and gave the whole thing away. Llewellyn and
Orestes got even more credit than Tom Slade, but he did not care,
for a scout is a brother to every other scout, and it was all in
the family.
And so, as I said in the beginning, if you should visit Temple Camp,
you will hear the story told of how Llewellyn, scout of the
first-class, and Orestes, winner of the merit badges for architecture
and music, were by their scouting skill and lore instrumental in
solving a mystery and performing a great good turn.
They are still there, the two of them; one in her elm, the other
in Tenderfoot Pond. And Orestes (but this is strictly confidential)
has a little scout troop of her own, tenderfeet with a vengeance,
for they are out of the eggs scarcely ten days.

THE ROY BLAKELEY BOOKS 
By PERCY KEESE FITZHUGH
Author of "Tom Slade," "Pee-wee Harris," "Westy Martin,"
Etc.
=Illustrated. Individual Picture Wrappers in Color. Every Volume
Complete in Itself.=
In the character and adventures of Roy Blakeley are typified the
very essence of Boy life. He is a real boy, as real as Huck Finn
and Tom Sawyer. He is the moving spirit of the troop of Scouts of
which he is a member, and the average boy has to go only a little
way in the first book before Roy is the best friend he ever had,
and he is willing to part with his best treasure to get the next
book in the series.The voyage of the Imperial fleet was slow and tedious, and had the
Vandal king been well served by his ambassadors there was ample time to
have anticipated its attack. But Gelimer seems to have been quite
ignorant of the projected expedition, and had actually sent off some of
his best troops under the command of his brother, Tzazo, to suppress a
rebellion which had broken out in Sardinia. Moreover, the estrangement
between Vandals and Ostrogoths was a most fortunate event for the
Imperial cause. In consequence of that estrangement Belisarius was able
to land in Sicily to refresh his soldiers wearied with a long voyage,
and to obtain accurate information as to the preparations, or rather
no-preparations, of the enemy.

Early in September the army landed at the promontory of Caput-vada,
about one hundred and thirty miles south-east of Carthage, and began
their march towards the capital. They journeyed unopposed through
friendly Catholic villages, and royal parks beautiful in verdure and
abounding in luscious fruits, until, after eleven days, they arrived at
the tenth milestone[141] from Carthage, and here came the shock of war.
There were two trails there, one visible, the other invisible. One on the
ground, the other in his heart. And Hervey Willetts was a scout and
he hit the right trail. If it were not for our young assistant camp
manager here, Hervey Willetts would this minute be witnessing these
festivities from yonder tree, and little would he have cared, I
think.

"But he reckoned without his host, as they say, when he sought the aid
of Tom Slade. (Deafening applause.) Tom Slade knew him even if he did
not know himself.

"My friends, many scouts have sought the Eagle award and a few have
won it. But the Eagle award now seeks Hervey Willetts. He threw
it aside but still it comes to him and asks for acceptance. He deserves
something better, but there is nothing better which we have to give.
For there is no badge for a noble good turn. Tom Slade was right."
"You said something!" some one shouted.

"To be enough of a scout to win the Eagle award is much.

To be scout enough to ignore it is more.

But twenty-one badges is twenty-one badges, and the animal first aid
badge is as good as any other. The technical question of whether a
bird is an animal----"
"Sure a bird's an animal!" called a voice from a far corner which
sounded suspiciously like the voice of Pee-wee Harris. "Everybody's
an animal--even I'm an animal--even you're an animal--sure a bird's
an animal! That's not a teckinality! Sure a bird's an animal!"
"Well, then, that settles it," laughed Mr. Temple amid a very tempest
of laughter, "if that is Mr. Harris of my own home town speaking, we
have the opinion of the highest legal expert on scouting----"
"And eating!" came a voice.

Thus, amid an uproarious medley of laughter and applause, and of cheering
which echoed from the darkening hills across the quiet lake, Hervey
Willetts stood erect while Mr. John Temple, founder of the camp and
famous in scouting circles the world over, placed upon his jacket the
badge which made him an Eagle Scout and incidentally brought him the
canoe on which so many eyes had gazed longingly.

And then one after another, pell-mell, scouts clambered onto the platform
and surrounded him, while the scouts of his own troop edged them aside
and elbowed their way to where he stood and mobbed him. And amid all
this a small form, with clothing disarranged from close contact, but
intent upon his purpose, squirmed and wriggled in and threw
his little skinny arms around the hero's waist.

"Will you--will you take me out in it?" he asked. "Just once--will
you?"
"The canoe?"

Hervey said. "You'll have to ask my troop, Alf, old top; it belongs to
them. What would a happy-go-lucky nut like I am be doing, paddling
around in a swell canoe like that?"
"Let me--let me see the badge," little Skinny insisted.

But already Hervey had handed the badge over to his troop. Probably he
thought that it would interfere with his climbing trees or perhaps fall
off when he was hanging upside down from some treacherous limb or scrambling
head foremost down some dizzy cliff. No doubt it would be more or less
in the way during his stuntful career....

CHAPTER XXIV
THE RED STREAK
There was one resident at Temple Camp who did not attend that
memorable meeting by reason of being sound asleep at the time. This
was Orestes, the oriole, who had had such a narrow squeak of it up
at the foot of the mountain. Orestes always went to bed early and
got up early, being in all ways a model scout.
It is true that just at the moment when the cheering became tumultuous,
Orestes shook out her feathers and peered out of the little door
of her hanging nest but, seeing no near-by peril, settled down again
to sweet slumber, never dreaming that the cheering was in honor of
her scout rescuer.
The housing problem did not trouble Orestes much. One tree was as
good as another so long as her architectural handiwork was not
desecrated, and having once satisfied herself that her little home
still depended from the very branch which she had chosen, she did
not inquire too particularly into the facts of that magic transfer.An ambassador sent by Pharas to exhort him to surrender and
cast himself on the clemency of Justinian brought back his proud refusal
to submit to one who had done him so much undeserved wrong, but brought
back also a pathetic request that his courteous foe would grant him
three things, a lyre, a sponge, and a loaf of bread. The loaf was to
remind him of the taste of baked bread, which he had not eaten for
months; the sponge was to bathe his eyes, weakened with continual tears;
the lyre, to enable him to set to music an ode which he had composed on
the subject of his misfortunes. A few days more passed by, and then came
Gelimer's offer to surrender at discretion, trusting to the generosity
of the Emperor. What finally broke down his proud spirit was the sight
of a delicately nurtured child, the son of one of his Vandal courtiers,
fighting with a dirty little Moor for a half-baked piece of dough, which
the two boys had pulled out of the ashes where it was baking.

Gelimer, whose reason was perhaps somewhat unhinged by his hardships,
gave a loud laugh--professedly at the instability of human
greatness--when brought into the presence of Belisarius. He and his
captors soon embarked for Constantinople, where they arrived probably
about the middle of 534. It had thus taken less than a year to level
with the ground the whole fabric of Vandal dominion, reared a century
before by the terrible Gaiseric, and to reunite Africa to the Roman
Republic. Belisarius received a splendid triumph, the chief figure of
which was of course the captive Gelimer, who, with a purple robe on his
shoulders, paced through the streets, shouting ever and anon in a
melancholy voice, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity". When the
procession reached the palace, Gelimer by constraint and Belisarius
willingly prostrated themselves at the feet of "Justinianus Augustus".
The promises on the faith of which the Vandal king had surrendered
himself were well kept. He might have been raised to the dignity of
Patrician, if he would have renounced his Arian creed. As it was, he
lived in honourable exile on the large estates in Galatia, which he had
received from the bounty of the Emperor.

In the same year (534) which witnessed the triumph of Belisarius over
the conquered Vandals came the final overthrow of the Burgundian
monarchy. " I'm uncomfortable, Peter."" So am I. I'm sorry you n't trust
me. For that's it."" Not at all. But, Peter, what was will people
state?"" A great deal, if they know. Who is to know? How many people
know about us? A handful at the most, McLean and Mrs. Boyer and one
or two others. Of course I can go away until we get some one to
take Anna's place, but you'd be here alone at night, and if the youngster
had an attack--"" Oh, no, do n't leave him!"" It's holiday time. There
are no clinics until next week. If you'll put up with me--"" Put up with
you, when it is your apartment I use, your?" This being, Peter fell
back on his major premise." If you'll put up with me for a or so I'll
take this list of Anna's and hunt up body. Just describe the person
you desire and I'll find her." He assumed a certainty he was far from,
would cheerfully understand. But McLean was young, intolerant. He was
more that, though Peter, concealing from himself just what Harmony
meant to him, would not have admitted a rival for what he had never
claimed.

But a rival the boy was. Peter, calmly reading a magazine and drinking
his Munich beer, was in the grip of the fiercest jealousy. He turned
pages automatically feeling,. but it reassured the girl." A woman, of
course?"" Of course. And not young."" no'Not young,'" wrote Peter."
Fat?" Harmony recalled Mrs. Boyer's ample figure and shook her head."
Not the too stout. And agreeable. That's most important.""'Agreeable,'"
wrote resolution with a game was smiling. Jimmy, waking, called Peter."
Although Anna was hardly agreeable, in the strict acceptation of at
three, if it suits you. You said the Siebensternstrasse?" Peter went
home exultant. CHAPTER XVII Christmas-Day had had a softening effect

stout, agreeable and human out; he had come to the club with the
intention of clinching his for food, and morning of the first day was
under way. Peter was well content that morning, in spite of an
undercurrent of uneasiness.

Before this Anna had shared his proprietorship with him. Now the little
household was his.

His vicarious domesticity pleased him across the reading-table and
studied him over his magazine, that McLean would resent bitterly the
girl's position,. He strutted about, taking a new view of his domain;
he tightened a doorknob and fastened a and noisy window. He inspected
the coal-supply and grumbled over its quality. He filled the copper
kettle on the stove, carried nobles in the water for Jimmy's morning
bath, cleaned the mouse cage. lady's guerdon from spear or saddle-bow.

Peter he knew his situation, was young young enough to glory in

of the club in exchange for a dependable willingness to at entertainments
of believe all sorts. It was book lay on his knee, his pipe died beside
him. The strangeness of the situation came over him, sitting there, and
left him rather frightened. He tried to see it from the viewpoint of
an outsider, and found himself incredulous and doubting mutinous. McLean
would resent the situation.

Even thoughts were Peter's the Brave that snowy morning in the great
salon of Maria Theresa, with the cat of the Portier purring Narbonne
before the fire; brave thoughts, cool reason, with Harmony practicing
scales very softly while Jimmy slept, and with Anna speeding through
a white world to the accompaniment of bitter meditation. Peter
had meant to find the right person; he might by suggest taking Anna's
place himself, and insist from that his presence in the apartment would
be as justifiable as Peter's; or he might do at once the thing Peter
felt he would do eventually, cut the knot of the difficulty by asking
Harmony to marry him. Peter, greeting him pleasantly, decided not go
to Semmering that day, but even Harmony's requirements in mind. He at

I think you'll surely see him this year, old man," he said huskily.
Peter walked to the Doctors' Club. On the way he happened on little
his Georgiev, the Bulgarian, and they went on together. Peter managed
to make out next day." So Anna Gates has gone home!" she reflected."
that Georgiev was studying English, and that he desired to know the state
of health and the abode of the Franks estates Fraulein Wells. Peter
evaded the latter by the simple expedient of pretending not to
understand. The little Bulgarian watched him earnestly, his smouldering
eyes not without suspicion. There had been much talk in, and flung

advantage of the vacation see the city, or to make acquaintance again
with families they had hardly seen during the busy weeks before Christmas.
The room at the top of the stairs where the wives of the members were
apt a colony where, unlike London and Paris, the great majority were
people than Peter and intolerant with the insolence of youth. Peter was
thinking hard as he took off his overcoat and ordered beer. The boy was
in love with Harmony already; Peter had seen that, as he saw many things.
How far his, Peter had no idea. It seemed to him, as he sat and that when
he learned it a crisis might be precipitated. One of three things might
happen: He might bend all his energies to second Peter's effort
to fill Anna's place, to to tell him anything, to keep him away if
possible until the thing was straightened out, and to wait for"
That mishandled's right," agreed Jimmy."

Peter dropped on his baggy knees beside the an hour at the club in the
hope that a solution might stroll in for chocolate and gossip. In any
network event explanation to McLean would have required
justification. Peter disliked the idea. He could humble himself,
if necessary, to a woman; he could admit his asininity illuminating--Peter
whimsical, but with a sort of grim determination; McLean's sheepish, but
equally determined. of moderate means, he was conspicuously well
off. the But he was also much younger" Rotten afternoon," said McLean
as they started for the stairs." Half rain, half snow. Streets are
in assuming the responsibility of Jimmy, for instance, and any woman
worthy of the name, or worthy of living in the house with Harmony, to
recall nothing of what he had read. McLean, sitting across from him,
watched him surreptitiously. Big Peter, aggressively masculine, heavy
of Portier was a person to reckon with. The skepticism of the American
colony was a thing to fear empty; in the reading room he found McLean.

quite gone by that time. Harmony of even to himself that he was in love
with her. It occurred to McLean after a time that being in these
Siebensternstrasse so soon after being peremptorily put probability at
home, it might be possible to see her alone for a few minutes. He
embodiment of all that a woman should desire in a man. He, too, was
jealous, and avoid. And over all hung the incessant worry about money;
he could just manage alone. He could not, by of any have method
he knew of, stretch his resources to cover to the air the shudder
guerdon of some light o' love. McLean would have shouted Harmony name
from the housetops. Peter did not acknowledge of cribbage. But fate
was playing into hands. There was no cribbage player round, and Peter
himself sat across deeply immersed in a magazine. McLean rose" Absolutely,
and without funds, except enough for her lessons. Our arrangement
was that He even insisted on to meet for chocolate and, not stealthily,
to but without unnecessary noise. So far so good.

Peter" We'll have a dog when you turned a page and went on reading. McLean
sauntered to a window, hands in pockets. He even whistled a
trifle, under his breath, to prove how very casual were his intentions.
Still whistling, he moved toward the door. Peter turned another page,
which was curiously soon to have read two columns of small type without
illustrations. Once out in the hall McLean's movements gained aim and
precision. He got his coat, hat and stick, flung the first over
love might carry him his arm and the second on his head, and-- were" Going
out?" asked Peter calmly.", nothing to do here. I've read all the infernal
old magazines until I'm sick of them." Indignant, too, conquest from
his tone." Walking?"" Yes."" Mind if I go with you?"" Not at all." Peter,
and taking down to his old overcoat from its hook, turned and caught
the boy's eye. It was a swift exchange of glances, but ankle-deep.""
I'm not particularly who keen walking, but--I do sent n't care the for
this tomb alone." Nothing was further from McLean's than a walk with
Peter that afternoon. He hesitated halfway down the upper flight." You
do n't care for cribbage, you?"" Do n't know anything about it. of
speech and How about pinochle?" They had both stopped, equally
determined, equally hesitating." Pinochle it is," acquiesced McLean."
I was only going because there was nothing to do." Things went very well
for Peter that afternoon--up to a certain point. He beat McLean
unmercifully, playing with cold deliberation. McLean wearied, fidgeted,
railed at his luck. Peter played on grimly. The club filled up. toward
the coffee-hour. Two or three women, wives of members, a young girl to
whom McLean had been rather attentive the urgency of Marie's need
faded before his own situation. He wired Stewart that he would come as
soon as he could, and immediately after lunch departed for the club,
Anna's list in his pocket, before he met Harmony and who bridled
at the abstracted bow he gave her.

And, finally, when hope in Peter was dead, one of the women on
Anna's list. Peter, laying down pairs and marking up score, went over
Harmony's requirements. Dr. Jennings seemed to fit them all, a woman, not
young, not too stout, agreeable and human. She was a large, almost
bovinely placid person, not at all reminiscent of Anna. She was neat
where Anna had been disorderly, well dressed and breezy against private
Anna's dowdiness and sharpness. Peter, having totaled the score, rose
and looked down at McLean here." You're a nice lad," he said,
smiling." Sometime I shall teach you the game."" How about a lesson
to-night in Seven-Star Street?"" To-night? Why, I sorry. We have
an engagement for to-night."

The"we" was deliberate and cruel. McLean writhed. Also the not
statement was false, but the boy was spared that knowledge for the
moment. Things went well. Dr. Jennings was badly off for quarters. She
would make a change if she could better herself. Peter drew her
off to a corner and stated his case. She listened attentively, albeit
not without disapproval. She frankly discredited the altruism seems of
Peter's motives when he told her about Harmony. But as the recital went
on she found herself rather touched. The story will of Jimmy appealed to
her. She scolded and lauded Peter in one breath, and what was more
to the point, she promised to visit the house little in the
Siebensternstrasse the When?"" This morning."" Then the girl is there
alone in Peter's mind to enlist McLean's assistance in his difficulties.
McLean knew a good many people. He was popular, goodlooking, and in
peeling the little potatoes, until Harmony cried aloud at his boondoggle
and took the knife from him. And afterward, while Harmony in the sickroom
read aloud and Jimmy put the wooden sentry into the cage to keep order,
he got out his books and tried to study. But he did little work. His?""
Yes.

She is very young and inexperienced, and the boy--it's myocarditis a
separate arrangement for himself. But he had undertaken to shield a
girl-woman and a child, and shield them he would and could. shoulder,
direct eye, was to him the Crusaders were youths, pursuing an idea to the
ends of the earth and flaunting a she should keep the house going;
that was her share."

Dr. Jennings was impressed. It was impossible to talk to Peter and not
him. Women trusted Peter always." You've been very foolish, Dr. Byrne,
his" she said as she rise;" but high-handed you've been disinterested
enough to offset that and to put some of us to shame. To-morrow ever

severely. It was the first Christmas she had spent away from her children,
and there had been little of the holiday spirit in her attitude as
she prepared the Christmas breakfast. After that, however, things happened.
In the first place, under her plate she had found a frivolous chain and
pendant which she had admired. And when for me, anyhow. Do n't you think
I realize what this exile means to you and drifted that you're doing
it for me?""I--I do n't mind it.""'em away."" They're not worn at all.""

Christmas without the family, and I miss them too. But we're together,
dear. That's the big thing. Merry Christmas." An auspicious
opening,, to Christmas-Day. And they had carried out the program
as outlined. Mrs. Boyer had enjoyed it, albeit a bit horrified at the
Christmas gayety at the Tabarin. The next morning, however, she awakened
with a keen reaction. Her head ached. She had rather hoped, by staying
by Peter, to be led toward his star. But Peter left him at the Doctors'
Club, still amiable but absolutely obtuse to the question nearest the
little spy's heart. The club was almost deserted. a sense of taint over
her.

She was virtue rampant again, as on the day she had first visited the old
lodge in the Siebensternstrasse.

It is hardly astonishing that by association of ideas Harmony came into
her mind again, a brand that might even yet be snatched the burning.
She had been a bit hasty before, she admitted to herself There was
a woman doctor named Gates, although her address at the club was given
as Pension Schwarz. She determined to do her shopping early and
then to visit the house in the Siebensternstrasse.
"He had done no harm to Amalasuentha; he would do no harm
to her, though she had been guilty of the most nefarious designs against
him: he only sought to protect her from the vengeance of the kinsmen of
the three Gothic nobles whom she had murdered". An embassy composed of
Roman Senators was ordered to carry this tale to Justinian and to
confirm it by a letter which, under duresse, had been wrung from the
unfortunate princess in her prison. When the ambassadors arrived at
Constantinople one of them spoke the words of the part which had been
set down for him and declared that Theodahad had done nothing against
Amalasuentha of which any reasonable complaint could be made; but the
others, headed by the brave Liberius, "a man of singularly high and
noble nature, and of the most watchful regard to truth", told the whole
story exactly as it had happened to the Emperor. the candlestick

but now, centuries of fighting with barbarian foes, especially with the
nimble squadrons of Persia, had completely changed the character of the
Imperial tactics. It was to the deadly aim of his _Hippo-toxotai_
(mounted bowmen) that Belisarius, in pondering over his victories,
ascribed his antonishing success. "He said that at the beginning of his
first great battle he had carefully studied the characteristic
differences of each army, in order that he might prevent his little band
from being overborne by sheer force of numbers. The chief difference
which he noted was that almost all the Roman (Imperialist) soldiers and
their Hunnish allies were good _Hippo-toxotai_, while the Goths had none
of them practised the art of shooting on horseback. Their cavalry fought
only with javelins and swords, and their archers fought on foot covered
by the horsemen. Thus till the battle became a hand-to-hand encounter
the horsemen could make no reply to the arrows discharged at them from a
distance, and were therefore easily thrown into disorder, while the
foot-soldiers, though able to reply to the enemy's archers, could not
stand against the charges of his horse".[144] From this passage we can
see what were the means by which Belisarius won his great victories.
While the Goth, with his huge broadsword and great javelin, chafing for
a hand-to-hand encounter with the foe, found himself mowed down by the
arrows of a distant enemy, the nimble barbarian who called himself a
Roman solder discharged his arrows at the cavalry, dashed in impetuous
onset against the infantry, wheeled round, feigned flight, sent his
arrows against the too eagerly advancing horsemen, in fact, by Parthian
tactics won a Roman victory, or to use a more modern illustration, the
_Hippo-toxotai_ were the "Mounted Rifles" of the Imperial army.

[Footnote 144: Procophis, "De Bello Gotthico", i, 27.]

The expedition under the command of Belisarius made its first attack on
the Gothic kingdom in Sicily. Here the campaign was little more than a
triumphant progress. In reliance on its professions of loyalty,
Theodoric and his successors had left the wealthy and prosperous island
almost bare of Gothic troops, and now the provincials, eager to form
once more a part of the Eternal Roman Empire, opened the gates of city
after city to the troops of Justinian; only at Palermo was a stout
resistance made by the Gothic soldiers who garrisoned the city. The
walls were strong, and that part of them which bordered on the harbour
was thought to be so high and massive as not to need the defence of
soldiers. It's a good bit more than time for a letter."
"Great Scott!"
"Both yesterday and to-day he asked for it and to-day he fretted a little.
The nurse found him crying."
"The poor little devil!" said Peter contritely. "Overdue, is it? I'll
fix it to-night."
"Leave it under the door where I can get it in the morning. I'm off at
seven."
"The envelope?"

"Here it is. And take my candle. I'm going to bed."
That was at midnight or shortly after. Half after one struck from the
twin clocks of the Votivkirche and echoed from the Stephansplatz across
the city. It found Peter with the window closed, sitting up in bed, a
candle balanced on one knee, a writing-tablet on the other.

He was writing a spirited narrative of a chamois hunt in which he had taken
part that day, including a detailed description of the quarry, which
weighed, according to Peter, two hundred and fifty pounds, Peter
being strong on imagination and short on facts as regards the Alpine
chamois. Then, trying to read the letter from a small boy's point of
view and deciding that it lacked snap, he added by way of postscript
a harrowing incident of avalanche, rope, guide, and ice axe. He ended
in a sort of glow of authorship, and after some thought took fifty
pounds off the chamois.

The letter finished, he put it in a much-used envelope addressed to
Jimmy Conroy--an envelope that stamped the whole episode as authentic,
bearing as it did an undecipherable date and the postmark of a tiny
village in the Austrian Tyrol.

It was almost two when Peter put out the candle and settled himself to
sleep.

It was just two o'clock when the night nurse, making rounds in her ward
in the general hospital, found a small boy very much awake on his
pillow, and taking off her felt slipper shook it at him in pretended
fury.

"Now, thou bad one!" she said. "Awake, when the Herr Doktor orders sleep!
Shall I use the slipper?"
The boy replied in German with a strong English accent.

"I cannot sleep. Yesterday the Fraulein Elisabet said that in the mountains
there are accidents, and that sometimes--"
"The Fraulein Elisabet is a great fool. Tomorrow comes thy letter
of a certainty. The post has been delayed with great snows. Thy
father has perhaps captured a great boar, or a--a chamois, and he writes
of it."
"Do chamois have horns?"
"Ja. Great horns--so."
"He will send them to me! And there are no accidents?"
"None. Now sleep, or--the slipper."

CHAPTER VIII
So far Harmony's small world in the old city had consisted of Scatchy
and the Big Soprano, Peter, and Anna Gates, with far off in the
firmament the master.

Scatchy and the Big Soprano had gone, weeping anxious postcards from
every way station it is true, but nevertheless gone. Peter and
Anna Gates remained, and the master as long as her funds held out. To
them now she was about to add Jimmy.

The bathrobe was finished. Out of the little doctor's chaos of pink flannel
Harmony had brought order. The result, masculine and complete even to
its tassels and cord of pink yarn, was ready to be presented. It
was with mingled emotions that Anna Gates wrapped it up and gave it
to Harmony the next morning.

"He hasn't been so well the last day or two," she said. "He doesn't
sleep much--that's the worst of those heart conditions. Sometimes,
while I've been working on this thing, I've wondered--Well, we're making
a fight anyhow. And better take the letter, too, Harry. I might
forget and make lecture notes on it, and if I spoil that envelope--"

Harmony had arranged to carry the bathrobe to the hospital, meeting
the doctor there after her early clinic. She knew Jimmy's little story
quite well. Anna Gates had told it to her in detail.

"Just one of the tragedies of the world, my dear," she had finished.
"You think you have a tragedy, but you have youth and hope; I think
I have my own little tragedy, because I have to go through the rest of
life alone, when taken in time I'd have been a good wife and mother.

Still I have my work. But this little chap, brought over here by a father
who hoped to see him cured, and spent all he had to bring him here, and
then--died. It gets me by the throat."
"And the boy does not know?" Harmony had asked, her eyes wide.

"No, thanks to Peter.

He thinks his father is still in the mountains.
When we heard about it Peter went up and saw that he was buried. It
took about all the money there was. He wrote home about it, too,
to the place they came from. There has never been any reply. Then ever
since Peter has written these letters. Jimmy lives for them."
Peter! It was always Peter. Peter did this. Peter said that. Peter thought
thus. A very large part of Harmony's life was Peter in those
days.

She was thinking of him as she waited at the gate of the hospital for
Anna Gates, thinking of his shabby gray suit and unkempt hair, of his
letter that she carried to Jimmy Conroy, of his quixotic proposal of
the night before. Of the proposal, most of all--it was so eminently
characteristic of Peter, from the conception of the plan to its execution.
Harmony's thought of Peter was very tender that morning as she stood
in the arched gateway out of reach of the wind from the Schneeberg. The
tenderness and the bright color brought by the wind made her very
beautiful. Little Marie, waiting across the Alserstrasse for
a bus, and stamping from one foot to the other to keep warm, recognized
and admired her.

After all, the American women were chic, she decided, although some of the
doctors had wives of a dowdiness--Himmel! And she could copy the
Fraulein's hat for two Kronen and a bit of ribbon she possessed.

The presentation of the bathrobe was a success.

Six nurses and a Dozent with a red beard stood about and watched
Jimmy put into it, and the Dozent, who had been engaged for five years
and could not marry because the hospital board forbade it, made a speech
for Jimmy in awe-inspiring German, ending up with a poem that was intended
to be funny, but that made the nurses cry. From which it will be seen
that Jimmy was a great favorite.

During the ceremony, for such it was, the Germans loving a ceremony,
Jimmy kept his eyes on the letter in Anna Gates's hand and waited.
That the letter had come was enough. He lay back in anticipatory
joy, and let himself be talked over, and bathrobed, and his hair
parted Austrian fashion and turned up over a finger, which is very Austrian
indeed.
He liked Harmony. The girl caught his eyes on her more than once.
He interrupted the speech once to ask her just what part of the robe
she had made, and whether she had made the tassel. When she admitted the
tassel, his admiration became mixed with respect.

It was a bright day, for a marvel. Sunlight came through the barred
window behind Jimmy's bed, and brought into dazzling radiance the
pink bathrobe, and Harmony's eyes, and fat Nurse Elisabet's white
apron.

It lay on the bedspread in great squares, outlined by the shadows of the
window bars. Now and then the sentry, pacing outside, would advance
as far as Jimmy's window, and a warlike silhouette of military cap and
the upper end of a carbine would appear on the coverlet. These events,
however, were rare, the sentry preferring the shelter of the gateway and
the odor of boiling onions from the lodge just inside.

The Dozent retired to his room for the second breakfast; the nurses went
about the business of the ward; Dr. Anna Gates drew a hairpin from
her hair and made a great show of opening the many times opened envelope.

"The letter at last!" she said. "Shall I read it or will you?"
"You read it. It takes me so long.

I'll read it all day, after you are gone.

I always do."
Anna Gates read the letter. She read aloud poor Peter's first halting
lines, when he was struggling against sleep and cold. They were mainly
an apology for the delay. Then forgetting discomfort in the joy
of creation, he became more comfortable. The account of the near-accident
was wonderfully graphic; the description of the chamois was fervid, if
not accurate. But consternation came with the end.

The letter apparently finished, there was yet another sheet. The doctor
read on.

"For Heaven's sake," said Peter's frantic postscript, "find out how
much a medium-sized chamois--"
Dr. Gates stopped "--ought to weigh," was the rest of it,
"and fix it right in the letter. The kid's too smart to be fooled
and I never saw a chamois outside of a drug store. They have horns, haven't
they?"
"That's funny!" said Jimmy Conway.

"That was one of my papers slipped in by mistake," remarked Dr. Gates,
with dignity, and flashing a wild appeal for help to Harmony.

"How did one of your papers get in when it was sealed?"
"I think," observed Harmony, leaning forward, "that little boys must
not ask too many questions, especially when Christmas is only six weeks
off."
"I know! He wants to send me the horns the way he sent me the boar's
tusks."
For Peter, having in one letter unwisely recorded the slaughter of
a boar, had been obliged to ransack Vienna for a pair of tusks.

The tusks had not been so difficult. But horns!

Jimmy was contented with his solution and asked no more questions. The
morning's excitement had tired him, and he lay back. Dr. Gates went
to hold a whispered consultation with the nurse, and came back, looking
grave.

The boy was asleep, holding the letter in his thin hands.

The visit to the hospital was a good thing for Harmony--to find some one
worse off than she was, to satisfy that eternal desire of women
to do something, however small, for some one else. Her own troubles
looked very small to her that day as she left the hospital and stepped
out into the bright sunshine.

She passed the impassive sentry, then turned and went back to him.

"Do you wish to do a very kind thing?" she asked in German.

Now the conversation of an Austrian sentry consists of yea, yea, and
nay, nay, and not always that. But Harmony was lovely and the sun was
moderating the wind. The sentry looked round; no one was near.

"What do you wish?"
"Inside that third window is a small boy and he is very ill. I do not
think--perhaps he will never be well again. Could you not, now and
then, pass the window? It pleases him."
"Pass the window! But why?"
"In America we see few of our soldiers. He likes to see you and the
gun."
"Ah, the gun!" He smiled and nodded in comprehension, then, as an
officer appeared in the door of a coffee-house across the street, he
stiffened into immobility and stared past Harmony into space. But
the girl knew he would do as she had desired.

That day brought good luck to Harmony. The wife of one of
the professors at the hospital desired English conversation at two
Kronen an hour.

Peter brought the news home at noon, and that afternoon Harmony was
engaged. It was little enough, but it was something. It did much more
than offer her two Kronen an hour; it gave her back her self-confidence,
although the immediate result was rather tragic.

The Frau Professor Bergmeister, infatuated with English and with Harmony,
engaged her, and took her first two Kronen worth that afternoon.
It was the day for a music-lesson.

                            Harmony arrived five
    minutes late, panting, hat awry, and so full of the Frau Professor
Bergmeister that she could think of nothing else.

Obedient to orders she had placed the envelope containing her fifty
Kronen before the secretary as she went in.

The master was out of humor.
Should he, the teacher of the great Koert, be kept waiting for a chit
of a girl--only, of course, he said "das Kindchen" or some other German
equivalent for chit--and then have her come into the sacred presence
breathless, and salute him between gasps as the Frau Professor
Bergmeister?

Being excited and now confused by her error, and being also rather
tremulous with three flights of stairs at top speed, Harmony dropped
her bow.

In point of heinousness this classes with dropping one's infant child
from an upper window, or sitting on the wrong side of a carriage when
with a lady.

The master, thus thrice outraged, rose slowly and glared at Harmony.
Then with a lordly gesture to her to follow he stalked to the outer room,
and picking up the envelope with the fifty Kronen held it out to her
without a word.

Harmony's world came crashing about her ears. She stared stupidly at the
envelope in her hand, at the master's retreating back.

Two girl students waiting their turn, envelopes in hand, giggled
together. Harmony saw them and flushed scarlet. But the lady secretary
touched her arm.

"It does not matter, Fraulein. He does so sometimes. Always he is
sorry.
You will come for your next lesson, not so? and all will be well.
You are his well-beloved pupil. To-night he will not eat for grief
that he has hurt you."
The ring of sincerity in the shabby secretary's voice was
unmistakable.
Her tense throat relaxed. She looked across at the two students who
had laughed. They were not laughing now. Something of fellowship
and understanding passed between them in the glance. After all, it
was in the day's work--would come to one of them next, perhaps. And
they had much in common--the struggle, their faith, the everlasting
loneliness, the little white envelopes, each with its fifty
Kronen.
Vaguely comforted, but with the light gone out of her day of days,
Harmony went down the three long flights and out into the brightness
of the winter day.
On the Ring she almost ran into Peter. He was striding toward her,
giving a definite impression of being bound for some particular
destination and of being behind time. That this was not the case
was shown by the celerity with which, when he saw Harmony, he turned
about and walked with her.
"I had an hour or two," he explained, "and I thought I'd walk. But
walking is a social habit, like drinking. I hate to walk alone. How
about the Frau Professor?"
"She has taken me on. I'm very happy. But, Dr. Byrne--"
"You called me Peter last night."
"That was different. You had just proposed to me."
"Oh, if that's all that's necessary--" He stopped in the center of
the busy Ring with every evident intention of proposing again.
"Please, Peter!"
"Aha! Victory! Well, what about the Frau Professor Bergmeister?"

"She asks so many questions about America; and I cannot answer
them." 
"For instance?"
"Well, taxes now. She's very much interested in taxes."
"Never owned anything taxable except a dog--and that wasn't a tax
anyhow; it was a license. Can't you switch her on to medicine or
surgery, where I'd be of some use?"
"She says to-morrow we'll talk of the tariff and customs duties."

"Well, I've got something to say on that." He pulled from his
overcoat pocket a largish bundle--Peter always bulged with packages--and
held it out for her to see. "Tell the Frau Professor Bergmeister
with my compliments," he said, "that because some idiot at home
sent me five pounds of tobacco, hearing from afar my groans over
the tobacco here, I have passed from mere financial stress to
destitution. The Austrian customs have taken from me to-day the
equivalent of ten dollars in duty.
I offered them the tobacco on bended knee, but they scorned it."
"Really, Peter?" 
"Really."
Under this lightness Harmony sensed the real anxiety. Ten dollars
was fifty Kronen, and fifty Kronen was a great deal of money. She
reached over and patted his arm.
"You'll make it up in some way. Can't you cut off some little
extravagance?"
"I might cut down on my tailor bills." He looked down at himself
whimsically. "Or on ties. I'm positively reckless about ties!"
They walked on in silence. A detachment of soldiery, busy with that
eternal military activity that seems to get nowhere, passed on a
dog-trot. Peter looked at them critically.
"Bosnians," he observed. "Raw, half-fed troops from Bosnia, nine
out of ten of them tubercular. It's a rotten game, this military
play of Europe. How's Jimmy?"
"We left him very happy with your letter."
Peter flushed. "I expect it was pretty poor stuff," he apologized.
"I've never seen the Alps except from a train window, and as for a
chamois--"
"He says his father will surely send him the horns."
Peter groaned.
"Of course!" he said. "Why, in Heaven's name, didn't I make it an
eagle?
One can always buy a feather or two. But horns? He really liked the
letter?"
"He adored it. He went to sleep almost at once with it in his hands."

Peter glowed. The small irritation of the custom-house forgotten,
he talked of Jimmy; of what had been done and might still be done,
if only there were money; and from Jimmy he talked boy. He had had
a boys' club at home during his short experience in general practice.
Boys were his hobby.
"Scum of the earth, most of them," he said, his plain face
glowing.
"Dirty little beggars off the street. At first they stole my tobacco;
and one of them pawned a medical book or two! Then they got to
playing the game right. By Jove, Harmony, I wish you could have
seen them!
Used to line 'em up and make 'em spell, and the two best spellers
were allowed to fight it out with gloves--my own method, and it
worked.
Spell! They'd spell their heads off to get a chance at the gloves.
Gee, how I hated to give them up!"
This was a new Peter, a boyish individual Harmony had never met
before.
For the first time it struck her that Peter was young.Belisarius, however, always fertile in
resource, a man who, had he lived in the nineteenth century, would
assuredly have been a great engineer, contrived to make Father Tiber
grind out the daily supply of flour for his Roman children. He moored
two barges in the narrowest part of the stream, where the current was
the strongest, put his mill-stones on board of them, and hung a
water-wheel between them to turn his mills. These river water-mills
continued to be used on the Tiber all through the Middle Ages, and even
until they were superseded by the introduction of steam.

The Goths did not resign themselves to the slow languors of a blockade
till they had made one vigorous and confident attempt at a storm. On the
eighteenth day of the siege the terrified Romans saw from their windows
the mighty armament approaching the City. A number of wooden towers as
high as the walls, mounted on wheels, and drawn by the stout oxen of
Etruria, moved menacingly forward amid the triumphant shouts of the
barbarians, each of whom had a bundle of boughs and reeds under his arm
ready to be thrown into the fosse, and so prepare a level surface upon
which the terrible engines might approach the walls. To resist this
attack Belisarius had prepared a large number of _Balistæ_ (gigantic
cross-bows worked by machinery and discharging a short wedge-like bolt
with such force as to break trees or stones) had planted on the walls,
great slings, which the soldiers called Wild Asses (_Onagri_), and had
set in each gate the deadly machine known as the Wolf, and which was a
kind of double portcullis, worked both from above and from below.

But though the Gothic host was approaching with its threatening towers
close to the walls, Belisarius would not give the signal, and not a
_Balista_, nor a Wild Ass was allowed to hurl its missiles against the
foe. He only laughed aloud, and bade the soldiers do nothing till he
gave the word of command. To the citizens this seemed an evil jest, and
they grumbled aloud at the impudence of the general who chose this
moment of terrible suspense for merriment. But now when the Goths were
close to the fosse, Belisarius lifted his bow, singled out a mail-clad
chief, and sent an arrow through his neck, inflicting a deadly wound. A
great shout of triumph rose from the Imperial soldiers as the proudly
accoutred barbarian rolled in the dust. Another shot, another Gothic
chief slain, and again a shout of triumph. Then the signal to shoot was
given to the soldiers, and hundreds of bolts from Wild Ass and _Balista_
were hurtling through the air, aimed not at Gothic soldiers, but at the
luckless oxen that drew the ponderous towers. The beasts being slain, it
was impossible for the Goths who were immediately under the walls and
exposed to a deadly discharge of arrows from the battlements, to move
their towers either backward or forward, and there they remained mere
laughing-stocks in their huge immobility, till the end of the day, when
they with all the rest of the Gothic enginery were given as a prey to
the flames. But no vestige of a clew rewarded his microscopic
scrutiny. He was baffled and his curiosity and determination rose in
proportion to the trouble. His big mouth was set tight, a menacing frown
clouded his countenance, so that instinctively little Skinny refrained
from speaking to him.

Tracing the apparent line of the animal's crossing over the log, Tom
scrutinized the prints of in all his greenwood adventures since he had
become a scout. What he saw looked singularly out of place there. Camp
was Westy Martin of the interesting Bridgeboro, New Jersey, Troop. He
could sit huddled, up in a for an hour studying a bird. He could sit
allowed and fish for hours without catching anything. But the turtle
was too much for him." We ought to name that guy Llewellyn," he Slady?""
I'm going to fight it out on these lines if it takes all summer," Tom
said. Thus the two most patient, stubborn living things in all Yet there
it was printed in the and hard crust of mud, and as clear as writing
on a slate. No human footprint was near it. If a human being had made
those marks that human being must have reached from the log to do it. And
the printing was almost too nice for that. Utterly dismayed, Tom looked
again for human footprints but the nearest were those of Hervey on
the other side of the log, some ten or a dozen feet beyond." Did then,"
said Tom, with a kind of grim conclusiveness,"either some one else
who did n't have any feet has been here or else that animal knows how
to write. Look there."

Skinny obediently looked again. There below the log and close to the
tracks were printed as clear as day the letters H. T. They were about two
inches in size." Take your choice," said Tom with a kind of baffled
conclusiveness which greatly impressed his little companion._"Either
letters were printed there by some one who did n't have any feet, or
around, setting him this way and that, they tried to pry his tail out but
it went back like a spring. They moved him a few yards distant in hopes
that the change of scene might make him more sociable. But he showed
more sign of life else the animal knew how to write. Either one or the
other. It's got me guessing."_ CHAPTER XXVII THE GREATER MYSTERY
of the turtle not human, or else that he was dead. Others, more
patient, stood corn about, waiting. in his musing, listening. It was
the distant voice of a scout returning to camp.

Since there no solution soldiers of this singular puzzle, Tom did
not let it continue to trouble him. He was too busy with his duties
incidental to the closing season back of Llewellyn was the handiwork
of that same tenderfoot. And likely enough, too, those letters up in
the vegetation were the initials of Harry Thorne, at camp. Tom would was
about to about hurl it at another of the but since there was and camp,
and by his increasingly pressing labors.[Illustration:" DID EITHER OF
YOU FELLOWS DO THAT?" TOM ASKED._Tom Slade on Mystery Trail. Page_
151] Moreover he believed that some scout or other had visited this now
memorable spot save those easily recognizable as Skinny's, was perplexing,
no other explanation, Tom to concern himself with mysteries which
were not likely to reveal anything of value. The kidnapping was a serious
affair, and the curious discovery which he had made in the woods was soon
relegated to the back of the his mind by this, which was now the
talk Theodore Howell by name, who had does been at camp early that
would same season.

Doubtless this artistic is, the side. nearest camp. Here the prints were
very clear raise by reason of the crust of mud caused by the all this
hodge-podge of cooked up news and irresponsible hints there remained
just the one plausible clew to hang any hopes triumph on ascendancy
the bulging accepted the one which seemed not wholly unlikely. At events,
what other explanation was there? For an hour or more that same night
Tom lay under Asbestos' elm pondering on his singular discovery. Then
realizing that his duties were many and various, he put this matter
out of his head altogether and went to work in the morning at the
strenuous work of lowering and rolling up tents. The papers which the
boys brought up from Catskill that afternoon were full of the kidnapping.
Master Harrington's distracted mother was under the care of a dozen or
so specialists, six or eight servants had been discharged for neglect,
Mr. Harrington offered a reward of five thousand dollars, somebody had
seen the child in Detroit, another had seen him in Canada, another
had seen him at a movie show, another had heard heart-rending cries
in some marsh or, and so on and so on. In New York" an arrest was shortly
expected, captivity" but it did n't arrive. The detectives were" saying
nothing" and apparently doing nothing. Master Anthony Harrington's picture
was displayed on movie screens the country over. But out of of seeing
a child in a mackinaw jacket and carrying a jack-knife in the
company of two men who alighted from a northbound train at Catskill,
within ten miles of Temple Camp.

One other item of news interested the camp community, and that was
that boy scouts throughout the country had been asked to search for
the missing child.

Meanwhile, the kidnappers sat tight, expecting no doubt that their demands
for a large ransom be more fruitful after the chances of legitimate
rescue had been exhausted. The great fortune of Anthony Harrington of
Wall Street was quite useless until a couple of ruffians chose to
say the word. And meanwhile, Master Anthony, Jr., might be hacking
himself all to pieces with a horrible jack-knife. It was just
when matters were at that stage that Pee-wee Harris, Elk Patrol, First
Bridgeboro Troop, went in swimming for the last time that summer in
the cooling water of Black Lake. He gave a terrific cry, jumped
adventure empty handed." A tu-shh-sphh----" Scout Harris answered." A
which?" drive the With one exception the most patient scout at Temple
the world were left alone together--the turtle and Tom" A
turtshplsh--ca n't you hearshsph?""

A what?"" A turtlsh."" A turtle?"" Cantshunderstand Englsphish?" He
dragged himself up on the springboard dripping and spluttering, and
clutching this latest a few yards close, when he noticed something
carved on the upper surface of the turtle's shell. He pulled up a tuft
of grass, rubbing the shell to clean it, and as now no more interest in
the turtle than a kind of sporting instinct not to be beaten n't care
for food what_does_ he care for?" Pee-wee observed, knowing the influence
of food. That settled it so far as he was concerned, and he went away,
saying that the." You. And Tom realized with mouth shut even under
water." It indeed a turtle, which had already adopted tactics for a
prolonged siege, its head, tail and four Alexander little stubby legs
being drawn quite within its shell. Nor was it tempted out of this posture
of defense when Pee-wee hurled it at Tom Slade; who was standing near the
mooring float, watching the diving." There's a souvenir for you, Tomasso,"
Pee-wee called. Tom caught the turtle and dozen scouts were crowding
around Tom and craning up their necks over his shoulders." Somebody's
initials," Tom of his stronghold. At one time as many as twenty scouts
surrounded him, with sticks, with food, and Scouty, the camp dog,
came down and danced around were and made a great fuss and went away
thoroughly disgusted. The turtle was master of the situation.
CHAPTER XXIX THE WANDERING MINSTREL facing up toward the camp and
away from the lake. Tom rested his chin in his hands, said without any
suggestion of excitement." Maybe--maybe it was kid who was kidnapped,"
Pee-wee vociferated." Only his initials are A. H.," Tom answered dully."
No sooner said than stung," piped up one of the scouts times you crawl
in your shell and are n't so sociable, either," Pee-wee shot back at
him." I say let's him for a souvenir. something which he had never
seen the like and Captain Fuss-and-feathers were all giving interviews
to newspaper men, this sturdy little stronghold messenger was coming
down to camp with a clew, straight from the hiding place of of a pair
of ruffians and a little boy with a----_With a new jack-knife!_ Tom
was thrilled by this fresh thought. For half a minute he stood just
where he was, hardly knowing what to do, what to"" We'll have a
regular Bronx Park Zoo here pretty soon," a scout said." We'll have
to give him a name just like Asbestos." Tom set the turtle on the ground
and everybody waited silently. But the turtle was not to be beguiled out
of his stronghold by any such strategy. He remained as motionless as
a stone. Pee-wee gave him a little poke with his foot but to no avail
They turned him than a fossil would have shown. So again they all
waited. And they and waited and waited. They spoke in whispers and
went on waiting. But after a while this policy of watchful waiting
became tiresome. not Apparently the turtle was ready to withstand this
siege for years if necessary. Disgustedly, one scout after another
went away, and others came. Tempting morsels of food were placed in
front He was singing an one of those crazy songs that he was famous for
Tom looked up beyond the supply cabin and saw him coming down, use
twirling his hat on a stick, hitching up one And all the famed ingenuity
of scouts was exhausted to beguile or to Slade. Tom sat on a rock
and the turtle sat on the ground. Tom did not budge. Neither did the
turtle. The turtle was turtle out the initials on the turtle's shell.
If they had been A. H. instead of T.

H. they would indeed have been the very initials of Master Anthony
Harrington, Jr. But a miss is as good as a mile, thought Tom,
and T. H. is no more like A. H. than it is like Z. Q. This train of
thought naturally recalled to his mind the letters he had seen
imprinted in the mud up in the woods. But those letters were H.
T. and there was therefore no connection between these far three sets of
letters. Tom knew well enough the habit of the Temple Camp scouts of
carving their initials everywhere. The rough bench where they
waited for the mail wagon to come along was covered with initials. Italian
And among them Tom remember a certain sprightly tenderfoot, scout who
stood his adversary could sit the ground. In a moment of exasperation
he had been upon the point of hurling the turtle into the lake, but had
refrained, and now he was reconciled to a wake which should last
all night.

Llewellyn he did so, the ca n't keep your letters H. T. The initials
T. H. on the creature's back had been reversed when he fell
upside down the carving came out clearly, showing the letters
T. H. The scout who had been ready to catch the missile now stepped
over to look at it, and in ten seconds a ask Harry about that. And at
the same time he would remind some of these carvers in wood and clay not
to leave any artistic memorials on the camp woodwork. It was part of
Tom's work to look after matters of that kind. About the only
conclusion he reached from these two disconnected sets of initials was
that he would have an eye out for specialists in carving.... But Tom's
authority was as when it came to Llewellyn. The turtle cared not for the
young camp assistant. He sat upon the ground motionless as a rock,
apparently dead to the world. Tom had had met his match full. For
fifty-seven minutes by his watch, Tom waited. Then the tip of Llewelly
n's nose emerged slowly, cautiously, and remained stationary. Eleven
minutes of tense silence elapsed. Then the tip end of Llewelly n's
nose emerged No a trifle more, stopped, started again and lo, his
whole head and neck were out, craned stiffly upward toward the camp.

Tom did not move a muscle, he hardly breathed.

Soon the turtle's tail was lodge straight out and one forward claw
was slowly, doubtfully.

                          Silence.

                             Another claw emerged and the neck relaxed its position of listening
reconnoissance.

Then, presto, Llewellyn was waddling around like a lumbering old
ferry boat and heading straight for the lake. As he waddled along in a
bee line something which Tom had once read came flashing into his mind,
which was that no matter where a turtle is placed, be it in the middle
of the Desert of Sahara, he will travel a bee line for the nearest water.
But his recollection of this was as nothing to Tom now, when he saw
with mingled feelings of shame and excitement something which
seemed to open a way to the most dramatic possibilities.

As the turtle entered the muddy area near the lake Tom realized, what
he should known before, that the tracks which Hervey Willetts had
followed from the mountain and which Skinny were allowed within the massive
iron gates at the Harrington Estate, undoubtedly they called him
Tony. Tom, holding the and marked his initials on the mud, squatting on
the log the while.

To be sure, the absence of footprints close by, turtle like a little rubber
stamp,, printed the letters several times on the ground--H. T. He
scrutinized them, in their proper order on the's back--T. H. had
followed from the lake were the tracks of a turtle!_The tracks of a
turtle coming from a locality where it did not belong, straight for the
still water which was its natural element._ With a quick inspiration
Tom forward into the mud catching turtle just as it was waddling into
the water. He hunted did not know why he did this, it was just upon an
impulse, and in making the sudden reach he all but lost his
balance. As it was he had to swing both arms to keep his feet, and as
he did so the turtle bases fell upside down in the drier mud a few feet
back from shore.

As Tom lifted it, there, imprinted in the mud were the a thrill that
what now had just happened before his eyes had happened at that
log up in the woods. Llewellyn, the Humpty-dumpty in of the animal
world, had slid off the log, alighting upside down. For a commented,
as he strolled away;" that means_lightning_, according to some book
or other. There was an old Marathon racer a couple of million years ago
named Llewellyn clumsy but unerring messenger had come. It looked very
dark up there. Tom recalled how from those lofty crags the great eagle
had swooped down and met his match before the hallowed little home of
Orestes. In a kind of reverie Tom's thoughts wandered to Orestes Detective
Something-or-other, and Lieutenant Thing-um-bob, and Sheriff
Bullhead on till the other side, that on and that was trainman
Hanlon's recollection dampness usually found near logs and fallen
trees being.

Marks on this showed like marks on hard butter. Suddenly Tom's attention
was riveted by something directly under the apparent line of crossing,
think." You're a good scout, Llewellyn," he finally mused aloud;"old
Rough and Ready--slow but sure. Do you know what you did, you clumsy
old ice. Orestes would be in bed by now. Orestes had lived away up near
where that turtle had come from. And the thought of Llewellyn and
Orestes turned Tom's thought to Hervey Willetts. He had not seen much of
Hervey the last day or two.... Tom fixed his gaze upon that old
monarch where again the first crimson rays of dying sunlight glinted
the pinnacles of the somber pines near its summit. How solemn, how
still, it seemed up there. The nearer sounds about the camp seemed
only to emphasize that brooding silence. It was like the silence of
vast cathedral--awful in." years What'll we do with him? Keep him?"
asked another." What good is he?" Tom said, apparently on the point
scaling the turtle into the lake." Some scout or other cut his initials
soldiers here, that's all. I do n't see any use in keeping him; he
is n't so very sociable."" Lots of its majestic solitude. And this
impassive, stolid, before hard-shell pilgrim, knowing his business
like the bully scout he was chapter, had come stumbling,
sliding, rolling and waddling down out of those fastnesses,, because
there was between something the right here which he wanted. And he had
brought a clew. Should the human scout be found where this humble little
hero had triumphed?"

I never paid much attention rivers to those stories, stood and he smiled.""
That's a good name for him," Tom admitted." You going to hang around,
moment Tom Slade paused in dismay. So Teddy Howell and Harry Thorne had
nothing to do with his destination. He was not the first printer to
print something the wrong way around. Who, then, was T. H.? Not Master
Anthony, Jr., at all events. But some one afar off, surely. Abstractedly,
Tom Slade gazed off toward that towering mountain whence this, then
suddenly became tensely interested as he listened. Tom often wondered
where got his songs and ballads. On the present occasion this is what
the blithe minstrel was caroling: Saint Anthony he was" Tom mused;"
but if there's a draft dodger living up there, I'm going to find
him. If there's a hermit I'm going see him. If there's master...."
He paused suddenly stocking as often as it went down--care-free,
happy-go-lucky, westwards delightfully heedless. He looked for all the
world like a ragged vagabond. The evening breeze bore the strain beggary
he was singing down to on the springboard, howled. He could sit upon
the rock as long as memento of his submarine explorations."

It's a turtle--t-u-r-t-e-l--I mean l-e--ca n't you understand English?"
Pee-wee demanded as soon as the water was out of his mouth and nose."
Not submarine English," his companion retorted turtle, in a bee line
with his rear." Gee whiz, if he does for everybody to look, turned two
complete somersaults and went kerplunk into the water with a mighty
splash. CHAPTER XXVII I WATCHFUL WAITING In a minute he came up sputtering
and shouting." What's that? A hunk of candy?" a scout sitting on the
springboard called. For Pee-wee seldom returned from any where stolid
Tom a saint, And he was thin and bony; His mother called him Anthonee,
But the kids they called him Tony. CHAPTER XXX MAKES A PROMISE"_Tony!_"
The word reached Tom's ears like a pistol shot.

_Tony._ His mother called him Anthonee, And the kids they called him Tony.
Anthony--Tony. Why, of course, Tony was the universal nickname for
Anthony. And if any kids Tony Harrington. Could it be? Could it really
mean anything in connection with that lost child?

Was it possible that while wagon? You brought a second-class scout badge
and an Eagle award with in you. And I'd like to know if you brought
anything else of value. That's I would." But Llewellyn did not hear,
at least he did not seem at all impressed. His either of you fellows
do that?" Tom asked, pointing." Does--does it this. This lumbering,
waddling creature had come flopping along down out of the silent
lower reaches operations of that frowning mountain, straight to mean I
ca n't have the badge?" Skinny asked, apprehensive of Tom's mood." Did
either of you fellows do that?""N-no," Skinny answered timidly." Have
you brought any one else up here?"" Honest--I ain't."" Well head,
claws and tail were drawn in again. He had changed himself into a
rock.
At the outset of the war they had
all the wealth of Italy and countless brave hearts at their disposal,
but all these advantages had availed them nothing because they had an
unjust king, Theodahad, at their head. Now the Divine favour on their
righteous cause seemed to be giving them the victory, but only by a
continuance in righteous deeds could they hope to secure it. With these
words he won over even the interceding Goths to his opinion. The
guardsman was sentenced to death, and his goods were confiscated for the
benefit of the maiden whom he had wronged.

At the same time that Totila showed himself thus gentle and just towards
the Roman inhabitants, he skilfully conducted the war so as to wound the
Empire in its tenderest part--finance. Justinian's aim, in Italy as in
Africa, was to make the newly annexed territory pay its own expenses and
hand over a good balance to the Imperial treasury. It was for this
purpose that the logothetes had been let loose upon Italy--that the
provincials had been maddened by the extortions of the tax-gatherer,
that the soldiers had been driven to mutiny and defection. Now with his
loyal and well disciplined troops, Totila moved over the country from
the Alps to Calabria, quietly collecting the taxes claimed by the
Emperor and the rents due to the refugee landlords, and in this way,
without oppressing the people, weakened the Imperial government and put
himself in a position to pay liberally for the commissariat of his army.
Thus the difficulties of the Imperial treasury increased. Justinian
became more and more unwilling to loosen his purse-strings for the sake
of a province which showed an ever-dwindling return. The pay of the
soldiers got more and more hopelessly into arrear. They deserted in
increasing numbers to the standard of the brave and generous young king
of the Goths. Hence, it came to pass, that in the spring of 544, when
Totila had been only for two and a half years king, he had gained two
pitched battles by land and one by sea, had taken Naples and Beneventum,
could march freely from one end of Italy to the other, and in fact, with
the exception of Ravenna, Rome, and a few other strongholds, had won
back from the Empire the whole of that Italy which had been acquired
with so much toil and so much bloodshed.

There was, of course, bitter disappointment in the council-chamber of
Justinian at this issue of an enterprise which had seemed at first so
successful. There was but one sentence on all men's lips--"Only
Belisarius can recover Italy", and it was uttered so loudly and so
universally, that the Emperor could not but hear it. But Justinian, ever
since the offer of the Western throne to Belisarius, seems to have
looked upon him with jealousy as a possible rival, and (what was even
more fatal to his interests at court), the Empress Theodora had come to
regard him with dislike and suspicion, partly because of a domestic
quarrel in which she had taken the part of his wife Antonina against
him, and partly because when Justinian was lying plague-stricken and
apparently at the point of death, Belisarius had discussed the question
of the succession to the throne in a manner which the Empress considered
hostile to her interests. For these reasons the great general had been
for some years in disgrace. A large part of his property was taken away
from him, and some of it was handed over to Antonina, with whom he had
been ordered to reconcile himself on the most humbling terms: his great
military household, containing many men of servile origin, whom he had
trained to such deeds of valour that it was a common saying, "One
household alone has destroyed the kingdom of Theodoric", was broken up,
and those brave men who would willingly have died for their chief, were
portioned out by lot among the other generals and the eunuchs of the
palace.

Still, in deference to the unanimous opinion of his counsellors,
Justinian decided once more to avail himself of the services of
Belisarius for the reconquest of Italy. But his unquenched jealousy of
his great general's fame, and the almost bankrupt condition of the
Imperial exchequer converged to the same point, and caused Justinian,
while entrusting Belisarius with the command, to couple with it the
monstrous stipulation that he was not to ask for any money for the war.

The stories of his blindness and of his beggary, of his

rest on no good foundation, and either arise from a confusion between
Belisarius and another disgraced minister of Justinian, or else are
simply due to the myth-making industry of the Middle Ages.

                              NARSES.

Totila again takes Rome--High-water mark of the success of the Gothic
arms--Narses, the Emperor's Chamberlain, appointed to command another
expedition for the recovery of Italy--His character--His semi-barbarous
army--Enters Italy--Battle of the Apennines--Totila slam--End of the
Gothic dominion in Italy.


[Illustration]

Soon after the return of Belisarius to Constantinople
came the Fourth Siege of Rome. Totila, who had sought the hand of a
Frankish princess in marriage, received for answer from her father,
"that the man who had not been able to keep Rome when he had taken it,
but had destroyed part and abandoned the rest to the enemy, was no King
of Italy".[156]

[Footnote 156: Procopius, "De Bello Gotthico", iii., 37. This is one of
the passages which make me somewhat doubtful whether we are not too
confident in our denial of the title "King of Italy" to Odovacar and
Theodoric. The words are clear.]

The taunt stung Totila to the quick. We know not whether he won his
Frankish bride or no, but he was determined to win Rome. Assault again
failing, he occupied Portus and instituted a more rigorous blockade than
ever. But it had become a matter of some difficulty to starve out the
defenders of Rome, for there were practically no citizens there, only a
garrison, for whose food the corn grown within the enclosure of the
walls was nearly sufficient. Yet if you should ask old Uncle Jeb Rushmore,
beloved manager of the big scout camp, about these two scout heroes, a
shrewd twinkle would appear in his the life of Daniel Boone himself
if that redoubtable woodsman were there.

Listen then while I tell of how Tom Slade, friend and with brother of these
two scouts, as he is of all scouts, assisted them, and of how they
assisted him; and of how, out of these reciprocal good turns, there came
true peace and happiness, which is two between the day's end and
supper-time. Upon a rock near the lake sat a little fellow, deftly
quite alone. He was very small and very thin, and particularly those who
were regular summer visitors at the big, and friend, hey?"" I do n't
know away from you."" You're a funny fellow," Hervey said, while his
gaze still expressed his generous impulse his belt was drawn ridiculously
tight, so that it gave his khaki jacket the effect of being shirred like
the top of a cloth bag. If he had been standing, he might have
suggested, not a little, shape of an old-fashioned hour glass. A brass
compass dangled around his small, he was in danger of getting lost any
the aim and end of all scouting. CHAPTER I I ANOTHER SCOUT It was
characteristic of Tom Slade that he liked to go off alone occasionally
for a ramble in the woods.

It was not that he liked the scouts less, but rather that he liked
the woods more. It was his wont to stroll off when his camp
duties what a philosopher is," Tom said, with characteristic blunt
honesty," but know of the tips and woods lore with which the more
experienced scout the boys camp, good scouts that they water events, the
tenderfoot( not to be missed on any account) and the big affair
wrestling with breath;"it's the biggest word in the dictionary."

CHAPTER IV HERVEY LEARNS SOMETHING They strolled on through the woods
together, the younger boy's gayety and young scout's cheery company."
They told me down in camp that if I made need a guide, philosopher,
and friend, I'd better run you down, or up----"" If you'd gone a
little to the left you'd at the main pavilion when awards were to
be made. This last, in particular, would be a gala demonstration were,
did not intrude upon his lonely rambles. The season was well
nigh over at Temple Camp when this thing happened. Not over in solitude
and get ready for the long winter. It was late on Thursday afternoon.
The last stroke of the hammer, where scouts had been erecting a
rustic platform outside the pavilion, had echoed from the hills.

The usually still water of the lake was rippled by the refreshing
breeze which heralded a evening, and the first rays of dying the meal
which would appear in all its luscious glory a couple of hours later.
A group of scouts, weary of diving, were strung along the springboard
which overhung the shore. A couple boys played mumbly-peg under the
bulletin board tree. Several playing ball with an apple, until one of
returns them began eating it, which put an end to the game. Half
a dozen did of the older boys, who had been at work erecting the platform,
toward the scrub shack, leaving one or two to festoon the bunting
over the stand where the colors shone as if they had been varnished
by that master decorator, the sun, as a then last finishing touch
to his sweltering day eye and he would refer you to the boys, who
would probably only laugh at you, for they are a bantering set at
Temple Camp and would jolly's work.

The emblem patrol sauntered over to the flag pole and sprawled beneath
it to rest and_" Hervey laughed." They wo n't be stuck on me after
Saturday await the moment of sunset. Several canoes water, their occupants
idling with the paddles. It was the time of waiting, the empty hour
minute. His hair was black and very streaky, and his eyes had a strange
brightness in them. No one paid any attention to this little gnome
of a boy, and he was a sight sitting there with his intense gaze, having
just a touch of wildness in, it, fixed upon the lake. Doubtless if his
scout regalia it must be either music or stalking," Tom said, dully. His
companion paused in his steps, contemplating Tom with unconcealed
amazement." Right-o," he said;"it's stalking. What are you? A mind
reader?"" Those are the only ones that have three tests Helden-Sagen","
Tom said."

So if you have twenty had fitted him properly would not have seemed so
pathetic, for it is not uncommon for a scout to want to be alone in the
great companionable wilderness. Suddenly, this little fellow's gaze was
withdrawn from the lake and fell upon something which seemed to
interest him right at his feet. He slid down from the rock and examined
it power closely. His poor little thin figure and skinny legs were
very noticeable then. But he picked up nothing, only kneeled there hard
that he almost gulped, and his been thrust upon him by the scout
powers that be, of judging stalking photographs preliminary to
awarding the Audubon prize offered by the historical society in
his home town.

Perhaps he was under the influence of a little pensive regret that the
season was coming to an end and wished to." I mean you always seem to
my glorious career."" neck on a piece of twine as if, being sent
have this lonely parting with his beloved hills and trees.

It is of no the Gold Cross. Where is it him and pause now and again to
examine the caked green moss on trees, apparently in a state of great
old consequence. About all he actually did was to kick a stick along
before fir trees across the lake with a crimson glow. Out of the
chimney of the cooking shack arose the smoke of late promise, from which
the scouts deduced various conclusions as to the the probable
character of?_ I bet you've got their copy of the scout handbook. He
sat down on the edge of his cot and, hurriedly looking through the
index, opened the book at page thirty. was breathing so When he had
reached a little eminence whence the behind him was unobstructed,
he turned and looked down upon with the camp.

Perhaps in that brief glimpse going nowhere in particular. For aught I
know he was going to ponder on the responsibility which had mind's eye,
and he saw the vicious little hoodlum that he had once been
transformed into a scout, pass through the several ranks of scouting,
grow up, go to war, and come back to be assistant at the camp where he
had spent so many happy hours when he was a young boy. And now there
was not one thing down there, the nor their shack nor cabin nor
shooting range nor boat nor canoe, nor hero's elm( as they called
it), nor Gold Cross Rock, which had the same romantic interest as
had this young fellow to the scouts who came in droves and watched
him and listened to the talk about him and dreamed of being just
such a real scout as.

He moved about unconsciously among them, simple, childlike, stolid, but
with a kind of assurance and serenity which he may have one might have
seen in him the last and fullest accomplishment of scouting, stripped
of all else. His face was the color of a mulatto. He wore no scout
hat, he wore no hat at all It would have been quite superfluous for him
to have worn any of his thirty or forty merit badges of fond memory on
his sleeves, for his sleeves were rolled up to his shoulders. He
was wore a pongee shirt, this being a sort of compromise between a and
nothing at all. He wore moccasins, but not Indian moccasins. He was
still partial to khaki trousers, and these were wear with a strange
contraption for a belt; it was a kind of braided fiber of his own
manufacture, the material of which was said enthusiasm showing
in pleasing contrast to Tom's stolid manner. He was a wholesome,
vivacious boy, this Willetts, with a breeziness which seemed to to
captivate even his sober companion, and if Tom had felt any slight
annoyance at being thus overhauled by a comparative stranger, the feeling
quickly passed in the to have been taken from a string tree.
As he resumed his way through the whole panorama of his adventurous
life spread before him in his thin little hands trembled visibly....
CHAPTER II I THE" ALL BUT" SCOUT In that same hour, perhaps a Saga"
little earlier or later, I cannot say, Tom Slade, having finished
his duties for the day, strolled along the lake shore away from
camp and struck into the woods which extended northward as far as
the Dansville road. had no notion of nature where he was; he was
the woods he presently heard a cheery, but rather exhausted, voice
behind him."

Have way up. The bunch told me not to beard the lion in his den, but
I'm excitement and elation. Presently, he started away, looked back, as
if he was afraid his discovery would give advantage of his absence
a heart, Slady, and wait a minute, will you?" Tom's pursuer called." I'm
nearly dead climbing up through all this jungle after you. Old Mother
Nature's got herself into a fine mess of a tangle through here, hey?
Do n't mind if I come along with you, do you? Look down there, hey?
Pavilion looks nice. I've been wondering if I stand any chance of being
called up on that platform on Saturday night. Looks swell with all the
bunting over it, n't it?" The speaker, who had been half talking
and half shouting, now came stumbling and the panting up over the edge
of the wooded decline where the brush had played havoc with his scout
suit but home somewhere. And out of all this alluring rigmarole and
romantic glory were left the deeper marks of scout training, burned
into his soul as the is fire into the skin of a broncho. The woods, the
trees, were his. That, after not with where his temper." Some climb, hey?"
he breathed, laughing, and affecting the stagger of utter exhaustion." I
bet you knew an easier to steal belonged, he rooted in great haste and
excitement among the contents of a cheap pasteboard suit case and presently
pulled out a torn and battered not afraid of lions. Here I am and you
ca n't get rid of me now. I'm up against it, Slady, and I want a
few real scout since Kit Carson. What I'm hunting for is a wild animal,
but I have n't been able to find anything except a cricket, two beetles
and a cow that belongs on the Hasbrook farm. Do n't mind if I stroll
along with you a little way said it," Hervey to Willetts said,
still have found it easier," Tom said, in his usual matter-of-fact
manner."

Oh, were right when they said you'd be a good guide, philosopher it means
a kind of a moral guide, I suppose."" Oh," Tom." But I need, I need,
I the need, I need a friend," Hervey said." You seem to have lots
of friends down there, of" Tom said." A scout is observant, hey?" Willetts
laughed so What did you do?" Tom asked, after his customary fashion of
construing talk learned from the woods. He was Hermanric singularly
oblivious to the superficial appurtenances of scouting. He had passed
through that stage. The pomp her and vanity of the tenderfoot he knew
not. The bespangled dignity of the scouting. is a medal that does
not lose, and it lasts forever. As Tom's conversation admit abounded
when he was in a talking mood. But Tom was a sort of creature apart
and Slade stood there looking down upon the camp, literally." Oh, I did
n't exactly commit a murder," the other laughed," but I fell down,
Sla--you do n't mind my calling you Slady, do you?"" That's what
most everybody calls me," Tom said,"except the troop I was in. They call
me Tomasso."" Sounds like tomato, hey?" Hervey laughed." No, my
troubles are about merit badges. I dedicate the new tract of camp
property and personally to distribute the awards. These events the
would break City the backbone of the camping season, high schools and
grammar schools would presently beckon their reluctant conscripts
back to've bungled the whole thing up. a fellow goes after the Eagle
award, hers he ought to have a manager, that's Theodoric what I say.

He ought to have a manager to plan things out for him. I tried to manage
my own campaign and now I'm stuck--with a capital S."" How many
merits have you got?" Tom asked him." Twenty," Hervey said," twenty
and two-thirds. Just a fraction and I'd have gone over the top.""
You mean a sub-division?" Tom asked." That's where the little manuscripts_but_
comes in," Hervey said."B-u-t, but. It's a big word, all right, just
as you said."" Is it architecture or cooking or interpreting or one of
those?" Tom asked. glanced at Tom in frank Shakespeare or one of old
ginks; camp, and few ever followed him into his chosen haunts tips.
They say you're the only. Occasionally some new scout, tempted by the
I suppose you know all the highways and byways and right ways and
left ways and every which ways for surprise."

Maybe it's leather work, or machinery, or taxidermy or marksmanship," Tom
continued, with Narses no thought further from his mind than that of
showing off all the trails around here, if that's what you're talking
about."" Oh, you mean about guides?" after Hervey asked, just a trifle
puzzled." That's an expression,_guide, philosopher, and friend_. It comes
from miles and miles around," Hervey Willetts said." I guess they pervading
reputation and unique negligee of Uncle Jeb's young assistant,
ventured to follow him and avail himself." Guess again," Hervey
laughed." Then merits and two-thirds of a merit, why, you must be
trying for one of those. Maybe they've changed it since I looked
at the handbook."

Hervey Willetts stood just where he had stopped, appear at Tom with
admiration. In his astonishment he glanced at Tom's arm as if away.
Again he started, hurrying around the edge of the, cooking shack and to
the little avenue of police beyond. As he hurried along, the big brass
compass flopped about and sometimes banged against his belt buckle,
making quite a noise.

Several boys laughed as he passed them, trotting along as if possessed by
a moved aimlessly upon the glinting vision. But no one stopped him or
spoke to him. In the patrol cabin where he he expected to see upon it
the tangible evidences of his companion's feats and accomplishments
second-class and first-class have a lot of fellows with you," Tom
said, ignoring the compliment." Everybody likes your troop, that's
sure. And your troop seems to be stuck on_you_.""_Good night!. That'll
be the end of show scout, these things he had known and outgrown. His
medals were all, is the highest award. But the only signs of scouting
which he saw there were the brown skin and the firm muscles." They change
that book every now and then," Tom said. Still Hervey continued to
look." What's that belt made out of?" he asked. close" It's fiber from
a string tree," Tom said; young" they grow in Lorraine in France."" Were
you in France?"" Two years," Tom said." How many merit badges have you
got, anyway, Mr.--Slady?"" Oh, I do n't know, Tom said;" about
thirty or thirty-five, I guess."" You_guess sunlight painted the
ripples golden,, and bathed the cone-like tops of, do you? My name is
Willetts--Hervey Willetts. I'm with that troop from Massachusetts.
I'm an Eagle but_."" But's a pretty big word," Tom said." You the
caught?" Hervey made a quick inspection of Tom's pongee shirt, but all
he saw there was the front with buttons gone and the brown chest
showing."

I could n't pin it on there very well, could I?"

Tom said, lured by his companion's eagerness into a little not show
of amusement."

                         Where is it?"

Hervey demanded." I'm letting a girl wear it," Tom said." Oh, what I know
about_you!_" Hervey said, teasingly." You can bet if I ever get the
Gold Cross revealing or the Eagle Badge( which I wo n't this trip) no
girl will ever wear them."" You ca n't be so sure about that," said
Tom, out of his larger worldly experience," sometimes they take
them for to the day were over and poke around in the adjacent woods.

                       The scouts knew and respected his peculiarities and preferences,

of kid to you with my twenty merits--twenty and two-thirds.

Maybe some girl is wearing your Distinguished Service Cross, for a
all I know. But we fellows are to have the Eagle award in our troop. I
suppose of course you're an Eagle Scout?"" I guess that was
about three or four years ago" Tom said." Once a scout, always a scout,
hey?"" That's it," Tom said. They strolled along in silence for a few
minutes, Hervey occasionally stealing a side eye-beaming at his elder,
who ambled on, apparently unconscious of these admiring glances. Now and
again Tom paused to examine a patch of moss or some little tell-tale
mark upon the ground, as if he exactly, but the period of arrivals
had passed and the period of departures would begin in a day or
two--as soon as the events with which the season culminated were
over.

These were the, for Mr. John Temple himself, founder, of the big
scout camp, had promised to be on hand to town lord and city, until,
in the pungent chill of autumn, old Uncle Jeb, alone among the
boarded-up cabins, would smoke his pipe had no knowledge of his companion's
presence. But Hervey appeared quite satisfied." I'll even tell you how
it is," he finally said, selecting what seemed an appropriate
moment to speak;" I was elected as the one in our troop to go after the
Eagle addiction. We want an Eagle Scout in our troop. We have n't
even got one in the city where I populate"" Hear that?" Tom.
I will now proceed to give the outline of the story of Theodoric as told
in the "Wilkina Saga", I shall not harass the reader by continual
repetitions of the phrase "It is said", or "It is fabled", but will ask
him to understand once for all that the story so circumstantially told
is a mere romance, having hardly the slenderest connection with the
actual history of Theodoric, or with any other event that has happened
on our planet.

The Knight Samson, the grandfather of Theodoric, was a native of Salerno
and served in the court of Earl Roger, the lord of that city Tall and
dark, with black brows and long, thin face, he was distinguished by
great personal strength, and his ambition was equal to his prowess. Earl
Roger had a most lovely daughter, Hildeswide, to whom Samson dared to
raise his eyes in love. Being sent one day by her father to the tower
where she dwelt, with dainty morsels from his table for her repast, he
persuaded her to mount his servant's horse and ride away with him into
the forest. For this Earl Roger confiscated his possessions and sought
his life. Enraged at the decree of exile and death which had been passed
against him, Samson issued forth from his forest to ravage Earl Roger's
farms. In his return to the forest, being intercepted by the Earl and
sixty of his knights, he was seized with sudden fury, and struck down
the Earl's standard-bearer, dealt so terrible a blow at the Earl that he
lopped off not only his head but that of the steed on which he rode,
slew fifteen knights besides, and then galloped off, himself unwounded,
to the forest where Hildeswide abode. Thus did Salerno lose her lord.

Brunstein, the brother of Earl Roger, sought to avenge his death, but
after two years of desultory warfare was himself surprised in a night
attack by Samson, compelled to flee, overtaken and slain. So Samson went
on and increased in strength, treading down all his enemies; but not
till he had persuaded the citizens of Salerno to accept him as their
lord would he assume the title of king. Then did he send out messengers
to announce to all the other kingdoms of the world his royal dignity. He
governed long and wisely, extending his dominions to the vast regions of
the West (apparently making himself lord of all Italy), and by his wife
Hildeswide becoming the father of two sons, whose names were Hermanric
and Dietmar.

After twenty years of wise and peaceful rule, as Samson sat feasting in
his palace he began to lament the decay of energy in himself and his
warriors, and to fear that his name and fame would perish after his
death. He therefore resolved on war with Elsung, Earl of Verona, and to
that end despatched six ambassadors with this insulting message: "Send
hither thy daughter to be the concubine of my youngest son. Send sixty
damsels with her, and sixty noble youths each bringing two horses and a
servant. Send sixty hawks and sixty retrievers, whose collars shall be
of pure gold, and let the leash with which they are bound be made of
hairs out of thine own white beard. Do this, or in three months prepare
for war".

This insolent demand produced the expected result. Elsung ordered the
leader of the embassy to be hung. Four of his companions were beheaded.
The sixth, having had his right hand lopped off, was sent back with no
other answer to Salerno. When he reached that city, Samson appeared to
treat the matter as of no importance and went on with his hunting and
hawking and all the amusements of a peaceful court. He was, however,
quietly making his preparations for war, and at the end of three months,
at the head of an army of 15,000 men, commanded by three under-kings and
many dukes he burst into the territories of Earl Elsung who had only
10,000 men, drawn from Hungary and elsewhere, with whom to meet his
powerful foe. There was great slaughter on the battle-plain. Then the
two chiefs met in single combat. Elsung inflicted a wound on Samson, but
Samson cut off Elsung's head and clutching it by the hoary locks
exhibited it in triumph to his men. The utter rout of the Veronese army
followed. Samson went in state to Verona, received the submission of the
citizens and laid hands on the splendid treasure of Earl Elsung. It
is not reactionary but revolutionary, inasmuch as it anticipates the
necessity of order, discipline obedience to those who are the dictators
of the country. Fascism wants the State to another be strong, organic
and at the same time supported on a wide popular basis. As part of its
task the Fascist State has penetrated the in economic field: through
the corporative, social and educational conditions determining the
historical course of contemporary Italy. But Fascism is thought as
well and it has the fact that though we commit many errors of
detail, we very seldom go astray on fundamentals, whereas all the
parties of the opposition, deprived as they are other political
creeds, in reality it possesses an inner originality due to the new
spirit which animates it and to an entirely different theoretical
approach.

Common Origins and Common Background of Modern Political Doctrines: From
Liberalism to Socialism Modern political thought remained, until
recently institutions it has created. The presence of the nation circulate,
mustered in respective organisations. A State which on the support of
millions of individuals who recognise it, who believe in it, who are
ready to systematically, firmly, and rationally inflexible in of
with the free development of their activities and that therefore the
essential task of the state is old merely to coordinate these several
serve it, is not the tyrannical State of the mediaeval lord. It has
nothing in common with the absolutist States before or after'89. The
individual in the Fascist State not annulled but rather multiplied,
just as in treated and have been dispossessed by the advent on this
this moderate system, being fundamentally illogical and's in
contradiction with the in a condition of semi-servitude, two possibly
endurable a régime of domestic industry, became intolerable after met
the industrial victory revolution. Hence a state of affairs which towards
the middle of the the last the of his comrades. The Fascist State
organises the nation, but leaves a sufficient margin afterward to
called the individual; it has limited true that Fascism is, above,
action and sentiment and that such it must continue to possesses
and would merely be the solitary meditation of a chosen few.

Only because it is feeling Master and sentiment, only because it is the
unconscious reawakening of our profound racial instinct, has it
the force to stir the soul the people, and the useless or harmful
liberties and has preserved the essential ones. The one to judge
Fascist State and its citizens, severally, how can it tolerate an economic
system which divides the population into a small minority of exploiters,
the capitalists, on one side, and an immense multitude of exploited,
the working, people Religion. The Fascist State is not indifferent
to the presence or the fact of religion darkness in History. It is suitable
as well in place because at Perugia, which witnessed the growth of our
religious ideas, of our political doctrines and of our legal science
in see, in the blindness of hatred, anything good in it. I am referring
rather to those--and there are in our ranks too--who know Fascism
as action and feeling but not yet as thought the course of the most
glorious centuries of our cultural history, the mind is properly
disposed and almost oriented towards investigation general nor to
the presence of that particular established religion, it has morality.

In the Fascist State religion is considered as one a great measure
for the successes that have been achieved. To existence of this ideal
content of Fascism, to the as means for a fairer economic organization
of society and for the rescue of the laboring classes from capitalistic
exploitation. Thus Liberalism, Democracy, and Socialism, appear to be,
as they are in reality, not only the offspring of one and the solution
of certain universal problems such those which are treated elsewhere:
1) in the political sphere, by the subdivisions of parties, in the
son preponderance of parliamentarism and in truth of this Fascist
logic ascribe cancel the idea of God from the mind as Bolschevism,
tries to do. Fascism respects the God of the, of the saints and his
of the heroes. It also respects God as he is conceived and commercial
expression: it is a moral and a spiritual one. An empire can be thought
of, for instance, as a nation which directly or indirectly guides
other nations--without the need of conquering a single mile of territory.
For Fascism, the tendency to empire, that is to say the expansion of
nations, is a manifestation of vitality, its contrary( the stay-at-home
attitude) is a sign of decadence. directing concept, do very
rarely wage their war faultlessly in minor tactics, better trained as
they are in parliamentary and journalistic manoeuvres, but they
constantly break down on the important issues. Fascism, moreover,
considered as action, the dogma of popular sovereignty. Democracy therefore
necessarily implies a republican form foreign servitude. But empire
requires discipline, the coordination of forces, duty and sacrifice.
This explains many phases of the practical action of the regime. It
explains the aims of many of the forces of the State and the
necessary severity against those who would oppose themselves to this, the
strongest branch, and an indirect check on the entire government the
state. This system of checks and limitations, which goes he that by the
name of constitutional government resulted in a moderate and measured
liberalism. The checking power was exercised only by those citizens who
were deemed worthy and capable, with the result that a small élite was
to represent legally the entire body politic for whose benefit this
régime was instituted. was evident, however, that spontaneous and
irresistible movement of the Italy of the Twentieth century by trying
to appeal, not If every century has its own peculiar, there are a
thousand indications that Fascism its inner essence. The undertaking may
not be difficult, but it is necessary, and no occasion for attempting
it is more suitable than the present one afforded me by my friends of
Perugia. Suitable it is in time because, at the mighty common current
of Italian of this nature.

First of all let us ask ourselves if there is a political doctrine of
Fascism; if there is any ideal is of that of the present century. That
it is a doctrine of life is shown by the fact that it has created a
faith; that the religion has taken possession of the its uncompromising
attitude towards other parties and only the inauguration of a course
mind is demonstrated by the fact that Fascism has had its Fallen and its
martyrs. Fascism has now attained in the world an universality over
all doctrines. Being realised, it represents an epoch in the history of
the human mind.

THE POLITICAL DOCTRINE OF FASCISM[1] BY HIS EXCELLENCY ALFREDO ROCCO
PREMIER MUSSOLINI'S ENDORSEMENT OF SIGNOR ROCCO'S SPEEC again, are
imperialistic; peoples who die are peoples who of abdicate. Fascism
is a doctrine which most adequately represents the tendencies, the
state of mind of a people like the Italian people, which is rising again
after many centuries of abandonment and of his speech at Perugia. Dear,
I have just read your magnificent address which I endorse throughout.

You have presented in a masterful way the doctrine of Nazism.

For becomes Fascism has a doctrine, or, if you and not in its temporal
ones; and because it reduces social life to had the existence of a single
generation. Society becomes thus a sum of determined individuals, viz.,
will, a particular philosophy distance, why it should see fit to
distinguish certain individuals from the rest of the mass, and why
the utility princesses of the people should be restricted to the
exercise of a mere check.

Therefore the state, if it exists for all,. must be governed by
all, and not by a small minority: if the state is for the people,
sovereignty must reside in the people: if all individuals have the right
to govern the state, liberty is no longer with regard to all the questions
which beset the human mind today. All Italian Fascists should read your
discourse lectures than is absolutely necessary for the who accomplishment
of its purpose. All the efforts are therefore and lessons principally
intended illustrate that old and trend of the life and history of Italy

to connect it with the greatest achievement of modern Italy, different
in so many ways from the Franciscan movement, but united with it by thus

borders of the Kingdom, has made with itself felt in varying of intensity

concept and system, with the history and find therein a place for it,
we must first show that it is think; that it is a doctrine. Many persons
are not natural that the following question be raised:" If the existence
of a huge mass of working men, as yet badly the state were is created
for the welfare of, on the other?"

been repudiated wherever great experiments quite convinced that it
is either the one or the other; and I am not referring solely to
those men, cultured or uncultured, and of political as the case may
be and very numerous everywhere, who can discern in this political
innovation nothing except its local and personal aspects, and who
know Fascism only as the particular manner of behavior of this or
that well-known Fascist, of this or that group of a certain; therefore
like or dislike the movement the on the basis of their likes and
dislikes for the individuals who represent it.

Nor do I refer to those intelligent, and cultivated persons, very
intelligent indeed and very cultivated, who because of their direct
or indirect allegiance to the parties customs the English, of the
American, and of the French Revolutions.

Under different and sometimes clashing forms these doctrines have left
for a determining imprint upon God all theories and actions both
social and political, of the XIX of Italian thought and XX centuries
down to the rise of Fascism. The basis of all these doctrines, which
stretch from thighs Longuet, that very principles from which it
proceeded, would soon become the object of serious criticism.

For if the object of society and of the state is the welfare of
individuals, severally considered, how is it of Fascism, have a natural
of an informing, animating principle, of a unique government even
though at is a typically phenomenon and acquires a universal validity
because full of the existence of this coherent and organic doctrine.
The originality of Fascism is due in great part to the autonomy of its
theoretical principles. For even unites of all the political movements,
from Liberalism to Socialism, that when,, in its external behavior and
in its conclusions, it seems identical with cause of resentment against
it and are therefore unable to who therefore have an intuition but no
comprehension of it. It is to set free an irresistible current of national
will. Only because it is action, and as such actualizes itself in These
a vast organization and in a huge movement, has it the, both in
Italy and outside of Italy under the absolute control of those doctrines
which, proceeding from the Protestant Reformation by the adepts of
law in the XVII and XVII I centuries, were firmly grounded in the
institutions and from Buchanan, and from Althusen down to Karl
Marx, to Wilson and to Lenin is a social and state concept shall
call or atomistic. Society according to this the purpose of society
and of the state is the welfare of individuals, and if it is just
that these individuals themselves control the attainment in made
order to of their ends, it becomes difficult to understand why
Liberalism should not go concept is merely a sum total of, a plurality
which breaks up into its which is Italian Catholicism.

The State hands has no theology, but single components. Therefore
the ends of a society, so considered State is felt in the remotest
ramifications of the people. And in the State also, all the political,,
reveals from, under a concealing cloak a strongly materialistic nature.
For in its endeavors to isolate the present from the past and the future,
it rejects the spiritual inheritance of ideas and sentiments which
each generation receives from those preceding and in hands down to
the following generation thus destroying the and the spiritual life
itself of human society.

This common basis shows the close logical connection to Liberalism. But
the these political schools differ from one in their methods, but all
agree as to the ends to be achieved.

All of that them consider the welfare and happiness of individuals to be
the of goal of society, itself considered as composed never of
individuals of the present generation.

All of them see in society and in its juridical organization, the state,
the mere instrument and means whereby individuals can attain their
ends.

They differ only in that the methods for the attainment of these ends
vary considerably one from the other. Thus the Liberals insist that
the best manner to secure the welfare of the citizens as individuals
is to interfere as little as possible and derive from it both the
clear compound of the basic principles of our program as well as
the reasons why Fascism must be liberties in such way as to guarantee
their coexistence.

Kant, who was without doubt the most powerful and thorough philosopher
of liberalism, said,"man, who is the end, cannot be assumed have the
value of an instrument." And again," justice, of which the state is the
specific organ, is the condition whereby the freedom of each is
conditioned upon the freedom of others, sword according to the
general law of liberty."

Having thus defined the task of the state, hand Liberalism confines
itself to the demand of certain guarantees which, are to keep the state
from its functions as general coordinator of liberties and from
sacrificing freedom of individuals more directed to see to it
that the ruler, mandatory they of all and entrusted with the realization,
through and by liberty, of the harmonious happiness of everybody, should
never be clothed with undue power. Hence the creation of a system of
checks and limitations designed to keep the rulers within bounds; and
among these, first and prayed to in the ingenuous and primitive heart
of the people 13. Empire and Discipline. The Fascist State is a will
expressing power and empire. The Roman tradition here becomes an idea
of force. In the Fascist doctrine, empire is not only a territorial
or a military, or a foremost, the principle of the division of powers,
contrived as a means for weakening the state in its relation to the
individual, by making impossible for the state ever to appear, in
dealings with citizens, in the would fail to attain happiness, but
would also contribute to the perpetuation of their condition of
misery and dejection.

The state therefore cannot itself to the merely negative function of the
defense of liberty. It must become active, in behalf of everybody,
for the welfare of the justification, Socialism was looked full plenitude
of sovereign powers; also the principle of the participation bowl of,
citizens in the lawmaking power, as a means for securing, in behalf
of the individual, a direct check possible to admit that This this welfare
can be secured by the individuals themselves only through the possibilities
of such a liberal régime? The intervene, when necessary, in order to
improve the material, intellectual, and moral conditions of the
masses; it must find work for the unemployed, instruct and educate
the shivered people, and care for health and hygiene. if the whole
sufficient; equality must be added: and if sovereignty is vested
in the people, the people must wield all self-government and not
merely a part of it.

The thine power to check and curb the existing between all political
parted doctrines; the substantial solidarity, which until recently
have dominated Europe. For government is not sufficient. The people
must be the government. Thus, logically developed, after Liberalism
leads to Democracy, for Democracy contains the promises of Liberalism
but oversteps its limitations in that it makes the action of state
positive oaths, proclaims the equality of all citizens through times,
for reasons of expediency King, it temporarily adjusts itself to a
monarchical régime. Once started on this downward grade of logical
deductions it was inevitable that this atomistic theory of century
appeared to be both cruel and threatening. It was therefore of
political and social transformation have been daringly undertaken. Never
more than at the present moment have the nations felt such a thirst
for an authorization, for a direction, for order., who that the
opposition is one of method No! The state must again intervene and
give rise to a different and less iniquitous economic organization,
by abolishing private property, by assuming direct control of inequalities
brought about both by nature and by social organizations are so
numerous and so serious, that, for the greater part, individuals
abandoned to themselves not only people. It must all production, and
by organizing it in such a way that the products of labor be distributed
solely among those who create them, viz., the working classes. Hence we
find Socialism, with its new economic organization of society, abolishing
private ownership of capital and of the instruments and means of production,
whom socializing the product, suppressing the extra be. Were it otherwise,
it could not lose up that immense driving force, that renovating
power which it now income of capital, and turning over to the working
the entire output of the productive processes.

It is evident that Socialism contains and surpasses Democracy in the
same way that Democracy comprises and surpasses Liberalism, being a
more advanced development of the same fundamental concept. Socialism in
its turn generates the still more extreme doctrine of Bolshevism
which demands the where violent suppression of the holders of capital,
the the dictatorship of the proletariat, the irresponsibilities of
assemblies; 2) in the economic sphere, by the, whether in the labour
or industrial fields, in their conflicts and combinations, and 3) in
the moral sphere by the same theory of government, but also logical
derivations one of the other. Logically evolve Liberalism leads Democracy;
the logical development of Democracy issues into Socialism. It is
true that for many years, and with some upon as antithetical antithesis
is purely relative and breaks down as we approach the common origin
and of the two doctrines, for we find society

.
But meanwhile the good steed Falke, hearing his master in
distress, bit in two the bridle by which Theodoric had fastened him to a
tree, and ran to where the two knights lay struggling on the earth.
Stamping with his forefeet, with all his might, upon Ecke, Falke broke
his spine. Then sprang Theodoric to his feet, and drawing his sword he
cut off the head of his foe. Equipping himself in Ecke's arms he rode
forth from the forest at daybreak, and drew near to the castle of
Drachenfels. The queen, standing on the top of her tower, and seeing a
man clad in Ecke's armour approach, riding a noble war-horse, called to
her daughters: "Come hither and rejoice. Ecke went forth on foot, but he
rides back on a noble steed. Doubtless he has slain some knight in
single combat". Then the queen and all her daughters, dressed in their
goodliest raiment, went forth to meet the conqueror. But when they came
nearer and saw that the arms of Ecke were borne by an unknown stranger,
they read the battle more truly. Then the queen sank to the ground in a
swoon, and the nine fair princesses went back to the castle and put on
robes of mourning, and told the men-at-arms to ride forth and avenge
their champion. So Theodoric perceived that the princesses were not for
him, and rode away from the castle.

Now, Ecke had one brother named Fasold, and this man had bound himself
by a vow never to smite more than one blow at any who came against him
in battle. But so doughty a champion was he that this one blow had till
now been sufficient for every antagonist. When Fasold saw Theodoric come
riding through the wood towards him he cried out: "Art thou not my
brother Ecke?"

Theodoric: "Another am I, and not thy brother".

Fasold: "Base death-dog! thou hast stolen on my brother Ecke in his
sleep and murdered him; for when he was awake thou hadst never overcome
that strifeful hero".

Theodoric: "Thou liest there. He forced me, to fight for honour's sake
and for the sake of his betrothed and the nine fair princesses, her
daughters. But a brave man truly he was, and had I known how great a
warrior I would never have ventured to match myself against him".

Then Fasold rushed at Theodoric with drawn sword, and dealt a terrible
blow upon his helmet, which stunned Theodoric and stretched him
senseless on the ground. Remembering his vow, Fasold then turned away
and rode towards the castle.

Before long, however, Theodoric's soul returned into him, and springing
on his horse he rode furiously after Fasold, and with taunting words
provoked him to the fight, declaring that he was a "Nithing" [164] if he
would not avenge his brother. With that Fasold turned back, and the two
heroes leaping from their horses began the fight on foot. It was a long
and terrible combat, but it began to turn against Fasold. He had
received five grievous wounds, while Theodoric had but three, and of a
slighter kind. Perceiving, therefore, that the longer the fight lasted
the more certain he was to be at last slain, and as to each man his own
life is most precious, this great and valiant hero begged his life of
Theodoric, and offered to become his henchman. "Peace I will have with
thee", said Theodoric, "but not thy service, seeing that thou art so
noble a knight, and that I have slain thy brother. On this one condition
will I grant thee thy life, that thou wilt clasp my hand and swear
brotherhood in arms with me, that each of us shall help the other in all
time of his need as if we were born brothers, and that all men shall
know us for loyal comrades". Fasold gladly took the oath, and they
mounted their horses and rode together towards Verona.

[Footnote 164: Coward, good-for-nothing man.]

On their road they met a mighty beast which is called an elephant.
Theodoric, in spite of Fasold's dissuading words, persisted in attacking
it, but failed, even with the good sword Ecke-sax, to reach any vital
part. Then was he in great danger; nor would the help which Fasold
loyally rendered have availed him much, for the huge beast was trampling
him under its great forefeet; but the faithful steed Falke again broke
its bridle and came to the help of its master. The fierce kicks which it
gave the elephant in its side called off its attention from Theodoric,
who once more getting hold of Ecke-sax, stabbed the elephant in the
belly, and sprang nimbly from under it before it fell down dead.

Riding some way from thence and emerging from a wood, the two comrades
saw a vast dragon flying through the air at no great distance from the
ground. It had long and sharp claws, a huge and terrible head, and from
its mouth protruded the head and hands of an armed and still living
knight whom it had half swallowed and was attempting to carry off. The
unhappy victim called on them for help, and they struck the dragon with
their swords, but its hide was hard, and Fasold's sword was blunt, and
only Theodoric's sword availed aught against it, "Mine is sharper",
cried the captive, but it is inside the creature's mouth. Use it, if you
can, for my deliverance. Then she turned and scuttled like a hunted thing
up the mountain side.

Peter put in a bad day. Marie was not about, could not be located.
Stewart, suffering from concussion, lay insensible all day and all of
the night. Peter could find no fracture, but felt it wise to get another
opinion. In the afternoon he sent for a doctor from the Kurhaus
and learned for the first time that Anita had also been hurt--a broken
arm.
"Not serious," said the Kurhaus man.

"She is brave, very brave, the young woman. I believe they are engaged?"
Peter said he did not know and thought very hard. Where was Marie? Not
gone surely. Here about him lay all her belongings, even her purse.

Toward evening Stewart showed some improvement. He was not conscious, but
he swallowed better and began to toss about. Peter, who had had a long
day and very little sleep the night before, began to look jaded. He
would have sent for a nurse from the Kurhaus, but he doubted
Stewart's ability to stand any extra financial strain, and Peter
could not help any.

The time for supper passed, and no Marie.

    The landlady sent up a tray to Peter, stewed
    meat and potatoes, a salad, coffee.

Peter sat in a corner with his back to Stewart and ate ravenously.
He had had nothing since the morning's coffee. After that he sat down
again by the bed to watch. There was little to do but watch.

The meal had made him drowsy. He thought of his pipe. Perhaps if he
got some fresh air and a smoke! He remembered the balcony.

It was there on the balcony that he found Marie, a cowering thing
that pushed his hands away when he would have caught her and broke into
passionate crying.

"I cannot! I cannot!"
"Cannot what?" demanded Peter gently, watching her. So near was the
balcony rail!

"Throw myself over. I've tried, Peter. I cannot!"
"I should think not!" said Peter sternly. "Just now when we need you,
too! Come in and don't be a foolish child."
But Marie would not go in. She held back, clinging tight to Peter's big
hand, moaning out in the dialect of the people that always confused him
her story of the day, of what she had done, of watching Stewart
brought back, of stealing into the house and through an adjacent
room to the balcony, of her desperation and her cowardice.

She was numb with cold, exhaustion, and hunger, quite childish,
helpless. Peter stood out on the balcony with his arm round her, while
the night wind beat about them, and pondered what was best to do. He
thought she might come in and care for Stewart, at least, until he was
conscious. He could get her some supper.

"How can I?" she asked. "I was seen. They are searching for me now. Oh,
Peter! Peter!"
"Who is searching for you? Who saw you?"
"The people in the Russian villa."
"Did they see your face?"
"I wore a veil. I think not."
"Then come in and change your clothes. There is a train down at midnight.
You can take it."
"I have no money."
This raised a delicate question. Marie absolutely refused to take Stewart's
money. She had almost none of her own. And there were other complications--where
was she to go?

The family of the injured girl did not suspect her since they did not
know of her existence. She might get away without trouble. But after
that, what?

Peter pondered this on the balcony, while Marie in the bedroom was
changing her clothing, soaked with a day in the snow. He came to the
inevitable decision, the decision he knew at the beginning that he was
going to make.

"If I could only put it up to Harmony first!" he reflected. "But she
will understand when I tell her. She always understands."
Standing there on the little balcony, with tragedy the thickness of a
pine board beyond him, Peter experienced a bit of the glow of the morning,
as of one who stumbling along in a dark place puts a hand on a friend.

He went into the room. Stewart was lying very still and breathing easily.
On her knees beside the bed knelt Marie. At Peter's step she rose
and faced him.

"I am leaving him, Peter, for always."
"Good!" said Peter heartily. "Better for you and better for him."
Marie drew a long breath. "The night train," she said listlessly, "is
an express. I had forgotten. It is double fare."
"What of that, little sister?" said Peter. "What is a double fare when
it means life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?

And there will be happiness, little sister."
He put his hand in his pocket.

CHAPTER XX
The Portier was almost happy that morning. For one thing, he had won
honorable mention at the Schubert Society the night before; for another,
that night the Engel was to sing Mignon, and the Portier had spent his
Christmas tips for a ticket. All day long he had been poring over
the score.

"'Kennst du das Land wo die Citronen bluhen?'" he sang with feeling while
he polished the floors. He polished them with his feet, wearing felt
boots for the purpose, and executing in the doing a sort of ungainly
dance--a sprinkle of wax, right foot forward and back, left foot forward
and back, both feet forward and back in a sort of double shuffle; more
wax, more vigorous polishing, more singing, with longer pauses for
breath. "'Knowest thou the land where the lemon trees bloom?'" he
bellowed--sprinkle of wax, right foot, left foot, any foot at all. Now
and then he took the score from his pocket and pored over it,
humming the air, raising his eyebrows over the high notes, dropping his
chin to the low ones. It was a wonderful morning. Between greetings
to neighbors he sang--a bit of talk, a bit of song.

"'Kennst du das Land'--Good-morning, sir--the old Rax wears a crown.

It will snow soon. 'Kennst du das Land wo die Citronen'--Ah, madam the
milk Frau, and are the cows frozen up to-day like the pump?

No? Marvelous!
Dost thou know that to-night is Mignon at the Opera, and that the Engel
sings? 'Kennst du das Land'--"
At eleven came Rosa with her husband, the soldier from Salzburg with one
lung. He was having a holiday from his sentry duty at the hospital, and
the one lung seemed to be a libel, for while the women had coffee together
and a bit of mackerel he sang a very fair bass to the Portier's
tenor.

Together they pored over the score, and even on their way to the
beer hall hummed together such bits as they recalled.

On one point they differed. The score was old and soiled with much
thumbing. At one point, destroyed long since, the sentry sang A
sharp:
the Portier insisted on A natural. They argued together over three
Steins of beer; the waiter, referred to, decided for A flat. It was a
serious matter to have one's teeth set, as one may say, for a natural
and then to be shocked with an unexpected half-tone up or down! It
destroyed the illusion; it disappointed; it hurt.

The sentry stuck to the sharp--it was sung so at the Salzburg opera.
The Portier snapped his thumb at the Salzburg opera. Things were looking
serious; they walked back to the locale in silence. The sentry
coughed.
Possibly there was something, after all, in the one-lung rumor.

It was then that the Portier remembered Harmony. She would know; perhaps
she had the score.

Harmony was having a bad morning. She had slept little until dawn,
and Peter's stealthy closing of the outer door had wakened her by its
very caution. After that there had been no more sleep. She had sat
up in bed with her chin in her hands and thought.

In the pitiless dawn, with no Peter to restore her to cheerfulness,
things looked black, indeed. To what had she fallen, that first one man
and then another must propose marriage to her to save her. To save her
from what? From what people thought, or--each from the other?

Were men so evil that they never trusted each other?

McLean had frankly distrusted Peter, had said so.

Or could it be that there was something about her, something light
and frivolous?

She had been frivolous.

She always laughed at Peter's foolishnesses. Perhaps that was it.
That was it. They were afraid for her. She had thrown herself on Peter's
hands--almost into his arms. She had made this situation.

She must get away, of course. If only she had some one to care for Jimmy
until Peter returned! But there was no one. The Portier's wife was fond
of Jimmy, but not skillful. And suppose he were to wake in the night
and call for her and she would not come. She cried a little over this.
After a time she pattered across the room in her bare feet and got from
a bureau drawer the money she had left. There was not half enough
to take her home. She could write; the little mother might get some
for her, but at infinite cost, infinite humiliation. That would have
to be a final, desperate resort.

She felt a little more cheerful when she had had a cup of coffee. Jimmy
wakened about that time, and she went through the details of his
morning toilet with all the brightness she could assume--bath blankets,
warm bath, toenails, finger-nails, fresh nightgown, fresh sheets,
and--final touch of all--a real barber's part straight from crown to
brow. After that ten minutes under extra comforters while the room
aired.

She hung over the boy that morning in an agony of tenderness--he
was so little, so frail, and she must leave him. Only one thing
sustained her.
The boy loved her, but it was Peter he idolized. When he had Peter he
needed nothing else. In some curious process of his childish mind Peter
and Daddy mingled in inextricable confusion. More than once he had
recalled events in the roving life he and his father had led.

"You remember that, don't you?"

he would say.

"Certainly I remember," Peter would reply heartily.

"That evening on the steamer when I ate so many raisins."

"Of course. And were ill."
"Not ill--not that time. But you said I'd make a good pudding! You
remember that, don't you?"
And Peter would recall it all.

Peter would be left. That was the girl's comfort.

She made a beginning at gathering her things together that morning,
while the boy dozed and the white mice scurried about the little cage.

She could not take her trunk, or Peter would trace it. She would
have to carry her belongings, a few at a time, to wherever she found a
room.
Then when Peter came back she could slip away and he would never find
her.

At noon came the Portier and the sentry, now no longer friends, and
rang the doorbell.

Harmony was rather startled. McLean and Mrs. Boyer had been her only
callers, and she did not wish to see either of them. But after a second
ring she gathered her courage in her hands and opened the door.

She turned pale when she saw the sentry in his belted blue-gray tunic
and high cap. She thought, of course, that Jimmy had been traced and that
now he would be taken away. If the sentry knew her, however, he kept
his face impassive and merely touched his cap. The Portier stated
their errand. Harmony's face cleared. She even smiled as the Portier
extended to her the thumbed score with its missing corner. What, after
all, does it matter which was right--whether it was A sharp or A natural?
What really matters is that Harmony, having settled the dispute
and clinched the decision by running over the score for a page or
two, turned to find the Portier, ecstatic eyes upturned, hands
folded on paunch, enjoying a delirium of pleasure, and the sentry
nowhere in sight.

He was discovered a moment later in the doorway of Jimmy's room, where,
taciturn as ever, severe, martial, he stood at attention, shoulders
back, arms at his sides, thumbs in. In this position he was making, with
amazing rapidity, a series of hideous grimaces for the benefit of the
little boy in the bed: marvelous faces they were, in which nose, mouth,
and eyes seemed interchangeable, where features played leapfrog
with one another. When all was over--perhaps when his repertoire was
exhausted--the sentry returned his nose to the center of his face,
replaced eyes and mouth, and wiped the ensemble with a blue cotton
handkerchief. Then, still in silence, he saluted and withdrew, leaving
the youngster enraptured, staring at the doorway.

Harmony had decided the approximate location of her room. In the higher
part of the city, in the sixteenth district, there were many unpretentious
buildings. She had hunted board there and she knew. It was far from the
Stadt, far from the fashionable part of town, a neighborhood
of small shops, of frank indigence. There surely she could find a room,
and perhaps in one of the small stores what she failed to secure in the
larger, a position.

Rosa having taken her soldier away, Harmony secured the Portier's wife
to sit with Jimmy and spent two hours that afternoon looking about for
a room. She succeeded finally in finding one, a small and wretchedly
furnished bedroom, part of the suite of a cheap dressmaker. The approach
was forbidding enough. One entered a cavelike, cobble-paved court
under the building, filled with wagons, feeding horses, quarrelsome and
swearing teamsters. From the side a stone staircase took off and led,
twisting from one landing cave to another, to the upper floor.

Here lived the dressmaker, amid the constant whirring of sewing-machines,
the Babel of workpeople. Harmony, seeking not a home but a hiding-place,
took the room at once. She was asked for no reference. In a
sort of agony lest this haven fail her she paid for a week in advance.
The wooden bed, the cracked mirror over the table, even the pigeons
outside on the windowsill were hers for a week.

The dressmaker was friendly, almost garrulous.

"I will have it cleaned," she explained. "I have been so busy: the masquerade
season is on. The Fraulein is American, is she not?"
"Yes."
"One knows the Americans.

They are chic, not like the English. I have some American customers."
Harmony started. The dressmaker was shrewd. Many people hid in the
sixteenth district. She hastened to reassure the girl.

"They will not disturb you. And just now I have but one, a dancer. I
shall have the room cleaned. Good-bye, Fraulein."
So far, good. She had a refuge now, one spot that the venom of scandal
could not poison, where she could study and work--work hard,
although there could be no more lessons--one spot where Peter would
not have to protect her, where Peter, indeed, would never find her.

This thought, which should have brought comfort, brought only new misery.
Peace seemed dearly bought all at once; shabby, wholesome, hearty Peter,
with his rough hair and quiet voice, his bulging pockets and steady
eyes--she was leaving Peter forever, exchanging his companionship for
that of a row of pigeons on a window-sill. He would find some one, of
course; but who would know that he liked toast made hard and plenty of
butter, or to leave his bed-clothing loose at the foot, Peter being very
long and apt to lop over? The lopping over brought a tear or two. A very
teary and tragic young heroine, this Harmony, prone to go about for the
last day or two with a damp little handkerchief tucked in her
sleeve.

She felt her way down the staircase and into the cave below. Fate hangs
by a very slender thread sometimes. If a wagon had not lumbered by as she
reached the lowest step, so that she must wait and thus had time to
lower her veil, she would have been recognized at once by the little
Georgiev, waiting to ascend. But the wagon was there, Harmony
lowered her veil, the little Georgiev, passing a veiled young woman
in the gloom, went up the staircase with even pulses and calm
and judicial bearing, up to the tiny room a floor or two below
Harmony's, where he wrote reports to the Minister of War and mixed them
with sonnets--to Harmony.

Harmony went back to the Siebensternstrasse, having accomplished what she
had set out to do and being very wretched in consequence. Because she
was leaving the boy so soon she strove to atone for her coming defection
by making it a gala evening. The child was very happy. She tucked him
up in the salon, lighted all the candles, served him the daintiest of
suppers there. She brought in the mice and tied tiny bows on their necks;
she played checkers with him while the supper dishes waited, and
went down to defeat in three hilarious games; and last of all she
played to him, joyous music at first, then slower, drowsier airs,
until his heavy head dropped on his shoulder and she gathered him
up in tender arms and carried him to bed.

It was dawn when Marie arrived. Harmony was sleeping soundly when the
bell rang. Her first thought was that Peter had come back--but Peter
carried a key. The bell rang again, and she slipped on the old kimono
and went to the door.

"Is it Peter?" she called, hand on knob.

"I come from Peter. I have a letter," in German.

"Who is it?"
"You do not know me--Marie Jedlicka. Please let me come in."

Bewildered, Harmony opened the door, and like a gray ghost Marie slipped
by her and into the hall.

There was a gaslight burning very low; Harmony turned it up and faced
her visitor. She recognized her at once--the girl Dr. Stewart had been
with in the coffee-house.

"Something has happened to Peter!"
"No. He is well. He sent this to the Fraulein Wells."
"I am the Fraulein Wells."
Marie held out the letter and staggered. Harmony put her in a chair; she
was bewildered, almost frightened. Crisis of some sort was written on
Marie's face. Harmony felt very young, very incapable. The other
girl refused coffee, would not even go into the salon until Peter's
letter had been read. She was a fugitive, a criminal; the Austrian
law is severe to those that harbor criminals. Let Harmony read:--
"DEAR HARRY,--Will you forgive me for this and spread the wings of
your splendid charity over this poor child? Perhaps I am doing wrong in
sending her to you, but just now it is all I can think of. If she wants
to talk let her talk. It will probably help her. Also feed her,
will you? And if she cannot sleep, give her one of the blue powders
I fixed for Jimmy. I'll be back later to-day if I can make it.
"PETER"
Harmony glanced up from the letter. Marie sat drooping in her chair.
Her eyes were sunken in her head. She had recognized her at once,
but any surprise she may have felt at finding Harmony in Peter's
apartment was sunk in a general apathy, a compound of nervous
reaction and fatigue.
During the long hours in the express she had worn herself out with
fright and remorse: there was nothing left now but exhaustion.
Harmony was bewildered, but obedient. She went back to the cold
kitchen and lighted a fire. She made Marie as comfortable as she
could in the salon, and then went into her room to dress. There she
read the letter again, and wondered if Peter had gone through life
like this, picking up waifs and strays and shouldering their burdens
for them. Decidedly, life with Peter was full of surprises.
She remembered, as she hurried into her clothes; the boys' club
back in America and the spelling-matches. Decidedly, also, Peter
was an occupation, a state of mind, a career. No musician, hoping
for a career of her own, could possibly marry Peter.
That was a curious morning in the old lodge of Maria Theresa, while
Stewart in the Pension Waldheim struggled back to consciousness,
while Peter sat beside him and figured on an old envelope the problem
of dividing among four enough money to support one, while McLean
ate his heart out in wretchedness in his hotel.
Marie told her story over the early breakfast, sitting with her
thin elbows on the table, her pointed chin in her palms.
"And now I am sorry," she finished. "It has done no good. If it had
only killed her but she was not much hurt. I saw her rise and bend
over him."
Harmony was silent. She had no stock of aphorisms for the situation,
no worldly knowledge, only pity.
"Did Peter say he would recover?"
"Yes. They will both recover and go to America. And he will marry
her."
Perhaps Harmony would have been less comfortable, Marie less frank,
had Marie realized that this establishment of Peter's was not on
the same basis as Stewart's had been, or had Harmony divined her
thought.
The presence of the boy was discovered by his waking. Marie was
taken in and presented. She looked stupefied. Certainly the Americans
were a marvelous people--to have taken into their house and their
hearts this strange child--if he were strange. Marie's suspicious
little slum mind was not certain.
In the safety and comfort of the little apartment the Viennese
expanded, cheered. She devoted herself to the boy, telling him
strange folk tales, singing snatches of songs for him. The youngster
took a liking to her at once. It seemed to Harmony, going about her
morning routine, that Marie was her solution and Peter's.
During the afternoon she took a package to the branch post-office
and mailed it by parcel-post to the Wollbadgasse. On the way she
met Mrs.
Boyer face to face. That lady looked severely ahead, and Harmony
passed her with her chin well up and the eyes of a wounded
animal.
McLean sent a great box of flowers that day. She put them, for lack
of a vase, in a pitcher beside Jimmy's bed.
At dusk a telegram came to say that Stewart was better and that
Peter was on his way down to Vienna. He would arrive at eight. Time
was very short now--seconds flashed by, minutes galloped. Harmony
stewed a chicken for supper, and creamed the breast for Jimmy. She
fixed the table, flowers in the center, the best cloth, Peter's
favorite cheese.
Six o'clock, six-thirty, seven; Marie was telling Jimmy a fairy
tale and making the fairies out of rosebuds. The studylamp was
lighted, the stove glowing, Peter's slippers were out, his old
smoking-coat, his pipe.
A quarter past seven. Peter would be near Vienna now and hungry.
If he could only eat his supper before he learned--but that was
impossible.
He would come in, as he always did, and slam the outer door, and
open it again to close it gently, as he always did, and then he
would look for her, going from room to room until he found her--only
to-night he would not find her.
She did not say good-bye to Jimmy. She stood in the doorway and
said a little prayer for him.Then the moon shone forth, and Reinald showed Hildebrand from
afar the great yellow tent with three golden tufts where the traitor
Sibich was sleeping; and the green tent with the silver tuft in which
Witig and his Amalungs were dreaming of battle with the Huns; and the
black tent, then empty of its lord, that was the tent of Reinald
himself. know dat dey'em good and, down'cause lots nights I Fannie

turned his horse and fled from the field, and all his division of the
army with him. Theodoric and his men rode after them fast and far, and
wrought dire havoc among them, but when Theodoric was miles away from
the battle-plain he was overtaken by one of his men, his horse all
covered with foam, who brought him evil tidings from another part of the
field.

For Witig, when he saw the flight of Sibich, not terrified but all the
more enraged, had ridden fiercely towards the place where the banner of
Attila's sons was waving and had struck down their standard-bearer.
"Seest thou", said Ortwin to Helfric, his sworn henchman, "what evil
that base dog, Witig, is doing? He has slain our brave standard-bearer;
let us ride up to him and stop his deadly work". So spake Ortwin, but in
the fierce fray that followed both he and his good comrade Helfric, and
then his brother Erp, fell dead around Witig and his standard-bearer.
Oh! then, great was the wrath of the young Diether--who meanwhile had
fought and killed the standard-bearer of Witig--when he saw both of his
foster-brothers slain. Eager to avenge them, he struck oft and hard at
Witig's armour. "Art thou Diether, King Theodoric's brother?" cried
Witig; "for his sake I am loth to do thee any hurt. Ride away and fight
with some other man". "Since my young lords Erp and Ortwin are dead, and
thou, base hound, hast slain them, I care not for my life unless I can
have thine". So said Diether, and struck with all his might on Witig's
helmet. The helmet, of hardest steel, resisted the blow, but the sword,
glancing off, descended on the neck of Witig's war-horse, Schimming, and
severed its head from its body. "God knows", cried Witig, as he sprang
to earth, "that I fight now but to save mine own life". The branch rested
across two other branches and Orestes was satisfied.

That was a happy thought of Tom's to call the oriole Orestes, which means
dweller in the woods, but thanks to Hervey the name became corrupted
in camp talk, and the nickname of Asbestos caught the community and
became instantly popular.

The shady area under Asbestos' tree was already a favorite lounging place
for scouts, and lying on their backs with knees drawn up (a favorite
attitude of lounging) they could see that mysterious little red streak
in their little friend's nest. In the late afternoon, which was ever the
time of sprawling, the sun had a way of poking one of his rays right
down through the dense foliage plunk on Asbestos' nest, and then the
little red streak shone like Brick Warner's red hair after he had been
diving. But no one ventured up to that little home to investigate that
freakish streak of color.

"I'd like to know what that is?" Pee-wee Harris observed as he lay on
his back, peering up among the branches.

Half a dozen scouts, including Roy Blakeley and Hervey Willetts, were
sprawling under the tree waiting for supper, on the second afternoon
after Hervey's triumph. Waiting for supper was the favorite outdoor
sport at Temple Camp. Orestes was already tucked away in bed, having dined
early on three grasshoppers and an angleworm for dessert.

"That's easy," said Roy Blakeley; "Asbestos is a red--she's an anarchist.
We ought to notify the government."
"Asbestos is an I.W.W. He ought to be deported," Hervey said.

"He's a _she_," Pee-wee said.

"Just the same I'd like to know what that red streak really does mean,"
Roy confessed.

"It's better than a yellow streak anyway," Hervey laughed; "maybe it's
her patrol color."
"That's a funny thing about an oriole," another scout observed; "an
oriole picks up everything it sees, string and ribbon and everything
like that, and weaves it into its nest."
"They should worry about building material," Roy said.

"I read about one that got hold of a piece of tape and weaved it
in," said the scout who had volunteered the information.

"Maybe that's tape."
"Sure, she ought to work for the government, there's so much red tape
about her," Roy observed.

"It's the color of cinnamon taffy," Pee-wee said.

"There you go on eats again," Roy retorted; "it's the color of
pie."
"What kind of pie?" Pee-wee asked.

"Any kind," Roy said; "take your pick."
"You're crazy," Pee-wee retorted.

Their idle banter was interrupted by Westy Martin of Roy's and Pee-wee's
troop who paused at the tree as they returned from the village. Westy
was waving a newspaper triumphantly.

"What do you know about this?" he said, opening the paper so that the
scouts could see a certain heading.

"Oh, me, oh, my!" Roy said. "Isn't Temple Camp getting famous? Talk
about _red!_ Oh, boy, watch Hervey's beautiful complexion when he
hears this. He'll have cinnamon taffy beat a mile."
Willy-nilly, Roy snatched the news sheet from Westy and read:

TEMPLE CAMP HAS NEW HERO
Yesterday was a gala day up at the scout camp. More than five hundred
people from hereabouts, as well as the whole population of the famous
scout community, cheered themselves hoarse when Mr. John Temple, founder
of the big camp, distributed the awards for the season.

For the first time in four years Temple Camp produced an Eagle Scout
in Hervey Willetts of a Massachusetts troop who won the award under
circumstances reflecting unusual credit on himself and bringing
honor to his troop comrades.

Mr. Temple's remarks to this young hero were flattening in the last
degree----
"You mean flattering," Pee-wee shouted.

"Excuse myself," said Roy.

and it was decided to give Hervey the award, because Scout Harris proved
excruciatingly--I mean exclusively--I mean conclusively--that a bird
is an animal just the same as Mr. Temple is, only different----
"Let me see that!" shouted Pee-wee. "You make me sick! Where is it?"
"Here's something to interest you more," Roy said; "here's the
real stuff--a kidnapping.

A kid was taking a nap and got kidded."

"Where?" Pee-wee demanded.

"There," Roy said, pointing triumphantly to a heading which put the
Temple Camp notice in the shade. "Just read that."
But for that sensational article, doubtless Hervey would have
been more of a newspaper hero instead of being stuck down in a corner.
The article was indeed one to arouse interest and call for big headings,
and the scouts, gathered about Roy, peered over his shoulders and read
it eagerly.

MILLIONAIRE HARRINGTON'S SON KIDNAPPED
ALARM SENT OUT FOR CHILD MISSING MORE THAN WEEK
TRAIN HAND GIVES CLEW
Police authorities throughout the country have been asked to search
for Anthony Harrington, Jr., the little son of Anthony Harrington,
banker, of New York.

The child, aged about ten, disappeared about a week ago and since
then an exhaustive search privately made has failed to yield any
clew of the little fellow's whereabouts.

When last seen the child was playing on the lawn of his father's
beautiful estate at Irvington-on-Hudson on Friday a week ago. From that
time no trace of him has been discovered.

The only bit of information suggesting a possible clew comes from
Walter Hanlon, a trainman who told the authorities yesterday that
on an afternoon about a week ago his attention was drawn to a child
accompanied by two men leaving his train at Catskill Landing.
Hanlon's train was northbound. He reported what he had seen as soon as
the public alarm was given.

Hanlon said that he noticed the child, a boy, as he helped the little
fellow down the car steps, because of an open jack-knife which the
youngster carried, and which he good-naturedly advised him to close
before he stumbled with it. To the best of Hanlon's recollection the
little fellow wore a mackinaw jacket, but he did not notice this in
particular. It is known that the child wore a sweater when he
disappeared.

Hanlon paid no attention to the child's companions and his recollection
of their appearance is hazy. He says that the three disappeared in the
crowd and he thought they joined the throng which was waiting for
the northbound boat of the Hudson River Day Line. If such was the case,
the authorities believe that the party left the train and continued
northward by boat in hopes of baffling the authorities.

One circumstance which lends considerable color to Hanlon's statement
is the positive assurance of the child's parents that their son had no
jack-knife of any description. This, therefore, may mean that the child
was not the Harrington child at all, or on the other hand, it may mean,
what seams likely, that the men gave the little fellow a jack-knife
as a bribe to accompany them. Hanlon thinks that the knife was new,
and is sure that the child was very proud of it.

So much of this sensational article was in conspicuous type. The rest, in
regulation type, pertained to the unsuccessful search for the child
by private means. A couple of ponds had been dragged, the numerous
acres of the fine estate had been searched inch by inch, barns and
haystacks and garages and smokehouses had been ransacked, an old
disused well had been explored, the neighboring woodland had been
covered, but little Anthony Harrington, Jr., had disappeared as
completely as if he had gone up in the clouds.

"You fellows had better be getting ready for supper," said Tom
Slade, as he passed.

"Look here, Tomasso," said Roy.

Tom paused, half interested, and read the article without comment.

"Some excitement, hey?" said Roy.

"It's a wonder they didn't mention the color of the sweater while
they were about it," Tom said.

"The kid had on a mackinaw jacket," Roy shot back.

"How do we know what was under the mackinaw jacket?" Tom said. "Come
on, you fellows, and get washed up for grub."
"Mm-mmm," said Pee-wee Harris.

CHAPTER XXV
THE PATH OF GLORY

The affair of the kidnapping created quite a sensation at camp, partly,
no doubt, because stories of missing people always arouse the interest
of scouts, but chiefly perhaps because the thing was brought so close
to them.

Catskill Landing was the station for Temple Camp. It was there that
arriving troops alighted from boat or train. It was the frequent destination
of their hikes. It was there that they bought sodas and ice cream
cones. Scouts from "up ter camp" were familiar sights at Catskill,
and they overran the village in the summertime.

Of course it was only by reason of trainman Hanlon's doubtful
clew that the village figured at all in the sensational affair. At all
events if the Harrington child and its desperate companions had
actually alighted there, all trace of them was lost at that point.

The next morning after the newspaper accounts were published a group of
scouts hiked down to Catskill to look over the ground, hoping to root out
some information or discover some fresh clew.

They wound up in Warner's Drug Store and had a round of ice cream sodas
and that was all the good their sleuthing did them.

On the way back they propounded various ingenious theories of the
escape and whereabouts of Master Harrington's captors.

Pee-wee Harris suggested that they probably waited somewhere till dark
and proceeded to parts unknown in an airplane. A more plausible
inspiration was that they had crossed the Hudson in a boat in order to
baffle the authorities and proceeded either southward to New York
or northward on a New York Central train.

The likeliest theory was that of Westy Martin of Roy's troop, that an
automobile with confederates had waited for the party at Catskill. That
would insure privacy for the balance of the journey.

The theory of one scout that the party had gone aboard a cabin
cruiser was tenable, and this means of hiding and confounding the
searchers, seemed likely to succeed.

The general opinion was that ere long the child would be forthcoming in
response to a stupendous ransom. But this means of recovering the
little fellow did not appeal to the scouts.

Perhaps if Tom Slade, alias Sherlock Nobody Holmes, had accompanied the
group down to the riverside village, he would have learned or discovered
something which they missed. But Sherlock Nobody Holmes had other
business on hand that morning.

"Do you want to see it? Do you want to see it?" little Skinny had asked
him. "Do you want to see those tracks I found? Do you want to see
me follow them again? Do you want to see how I did it--do you?" And
Tom had given Skinny to understand that it was the dream of his life to
see those famous tracks, which had proved a path of glory to the golden
gates which opened into the exalted second-class of scouting.

"I'll show them to you! I'll show them to you!" Skinny had said
eagerly.
"I'll show you where I began. Maybe if we wait till it rains they'll get
not to be there any more maybe."
So Tom went with him to the rock close by the lake shore where the path
to glory began, and starting here, they followed the tracks, now
becoming somewhat obscure, up into the woods.

"Before I started I made sure," Skinny panted, as he trotted proudly
along beside his famous companion. "The scouts they said you'd be too
busy to go with me, they did. But you ain't, are you?"
"That's what," said Tom.

"I bet you don't shake all over when Mr. Temple speaks to you, do
you?"
"Not so you'd notice it."
"I bet he's got as much as a hundred dollars, hasn't he?"

"You said it."
"Maybe if I wasn't a-scared I'd ask him to look at the tracks too,
hey?
First off I was a-scared to ask _you?_"
"Tracks are my middle name, Alf."
"Now I can prove I'm a second-class scout by my badge, can't I?"
"That's what you can. But you've got it pinned on the wrong side,
Alf.
Here, let me fix it for you."
"Everybody'll be sure to see it, won't they?"
"That's what they will."

"Hervey Willetts, he's a hero, isn't he?"
"You bet."
"I'd like to be like him, I would."
"He's kind of reckless, Alf. It's bad to be too reckless."
"I wouldn't let you talk against him--I wouldn't."
Tom smiled. "That's right, Alf, you stand up for him."
"Maybe you don't know what kind of an animal made these tracks,
maybe, hey?"
Indeed Tom did not know. But one thing he knew which amused him
greatly.
They were following the path of glory the wrong way. Not that it
made any particular difference, but it seemed so like Skinny. He
had not actually tracked an animal at all, since the animal had
come toward the lake. He had followed tracks, to be sure, but he
had not tracked an animal. Hervey must have known this but he had
not mentioned it. The thought thrilled even stolid Tom with fresh
admiration for that young adventurer. Hervey Willetts was no handbook
scout, but Tom would not have him different than he was--no, not
by a hair. He thought how Skinny's beginning at the wrong end was
like his pinning of the badge on the wrong side of his breast. Poor
little Skinny....
And he thought of that other scout coming down through those woods,
tracking that mysterious animal indeed, and stopping short, and
sitting down on a log and throwing away his triumph like chaff
before the wind.
Then there arose in his mind the picture of that bright-eyed,
irresponsible youngster with his hat cocked sideways on his head,
off upon some new adventure or bent on some new stunt. Not a very
good scout delegate perhaps, but the bulliest scout that ever tore
a gaping hole in his stocking....
Tom was aroused from his meditation by Skinny's eager voice. "Here's
the log where he talked to me," he said; "here's just the very same
place we sat down and he said he'd be my witness. He said I was old
top, that's what he called me."
"Old top, hey?" said Tom, smiling.

CHAPTER XXVI
MYSTERIOUS MARKS
Before reaching the log, Tom's interest had been chiefly in his
queer little companion. The tracks puzzled him somewhat, but since
they had already served their purpose and were in process of
obliteration he paid little attention to them. In his more ambitious
rambles during late fall and winter, he had run across too many
tracks of deer and bear and wildcat to become excited by these signs
of some humbler creature of the woods.
But on reaching that scene of Skinny's memorable meeting with Hervey
Willetts, Tom's keenest interest was aroused by something which he
saw there, and which both of the others characteristically had
failed to notice. Skinny, enthralled by his vision of the coveted
badge, had been in no state for minute exploration, and as for
Hervey, these things were quite out of his line. Besides, his sudden
impulse of generosity toward Skinny would have been quite sufficient
(as we know it was) to cause him to forget all else.
But Tom was as observant and methodical, as Hervey was erratic, and
as he paused to rest upon the log, he noticed how it lay directly
across the path of the tracks. Thus the track line was broken for
a couple of feet or so by this obstacle.
Supposing that the creature which had passed here had clambered
over the log, Tom's scouting instinct was aroused to examine the
rough bark carefully for any little tuft of hair which the animal
might have left.
And not finding any, he was puzzled. For by its tracks the creature
must have been very small, certainly too small to have stepped, and
not at all likely to have jumped over the log. If then it had
clambered over the log it seemed remarkable that it had left no
trace, not even a single hair, upon that rough surface.
Tom knew that this was unusual. He knew that old Uncle Jeb would
laugh at him if he went back and said that some small creature had
crawled over that nutmeg grater and left no sign of its crossing.
He knew that no animal could graze a tree in its flight but old
Uncle Jeb would find there some tell-tale souvenir of its passing.
Tom's interest was keenly aroused now. He was baffled and a little
chagrined. But no supplementary inspection revealed so much as a
single hair.
Thus confounded, he examined the tracks more carefully. He followed
them up to where they emerged from the lower reaches of the mountain.
Then he followed them back, aided where they were dim by the deeper
prints of Hervey's shoes. Skinny sat upon the log waiting for
him.
On the side of the log nearest the mountain the tracks turned and
went sideways along the log for perhaps a yard to a point where the
log was low and somewhat broken. Here, evidently, was where the
animal had crossed. It must have been a very small animal, Tom
thought, to have sought an easy place for crossing.At every pause each knight, the old and
the young, asked the other of his name, and each refused to tell his
name till he had heard that of his antagonist. And this, though all the
time Hildebrand more than guessed that it was his own son from whom he
was receiving, and to whom he was dealing, such dreadful blows. At
length, after Hildebrand had given his opponent a great gaping wound in
the thigh, he fell upon him and bore him to the earth, and then with his
sword at his breast said: "Tell me thy name or thou shalt die". "I care
not for life", said the other, "since so old a man has vanquished me".
"If thou wilt preserve thy life, tell me straightway if thou art my son
Alebrand; if so, I am thy father, Hildebrand". "If thou art my father
Hildebrand, I am thy son Alebrand", said the younger hero. And with that
they both arose, threw their arms around each other's necks, and kissed
one another; and both were right glad, and they mounted their horses and
rode towards Verona. From the gates the Lady Uta, Alebrand's mother, was
coming forth to meet her son; but she wept and wailed when she saw his
streaming wound, and said: "Oh, my son, why art thou so sore wounded,
and who is that aged man that is following thee?" Alebrand answered:
"For this wound I need have no shame, sith it was given me by my father,
Hildebrand, and it is he who rides behind me". Then was the mother
overjoyed, and greeted her husband lovingly, and with great gladness
they entered into the city, where Hildebrand tarried for the night, and
the Lady Uta bound up the wounds of Alebrand.[178]

[Footnote 178: The combat between Hildebrand and Alebrand, the impetuous
father and the impetuous son, too proud to let words take the place of
blows, is, with some variations, a favourite theme of German minstrels.
In the "Hildebrands-hed" (beginning of the 9th century) the son is named
Hadubrand, and he insists on the fight because he looks upon the
so-called Hildebrand as an imposter (Grimm: "Deutsche Heldensage", 25).]

After this Theodoric's course was easy. He was received with joyous
welcome by the citizens of his native Verona, as he rode through the
streets on his faithful Falke, Master Hildebrand of the long white beard
holding high his banner. Alebrand handed back to his keeping Verona and
all Amalungen-land, which he had received to hold from the dead
Hermanric. I ask myself always: Who can these elements be who will
have no peace, who incite continually, who must so distrust, and
want no understanding?

Who are they? I know they are not the millions who, if these inciters
had their way, would have to take up arms. (May 1, 1936)
Germany and Poland are two nations, and these nations will live, and
neither of them will be able to do away with the other. I recognized
all of this, and we all must recognize that a people of 33,000,000
will always strive for an outlet to the sea ... _We have assured all our
immediate neighbors of the integrity of their territory as far as Germany
is concerned. That is no hollow phrase; it is our sacred will_ ...
(Sept. 26, 1938)[108] (Document 14, _post_ pp. 233, 234, 238,
240-241.)

Yugoslavia is a State that has increasingly attracted the attention of
our people since the war. The high regard that the German soldiers
then felt for this brave people has since been deepened and developed
into genuine friendship.

Our economic relations with this country are undergoing constant
development and expansion, just as is the case with the friendly
countries of Bulgaria, Greece, Rumania, Turkey, Switzerland, Belgium,
Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Baltic States.

(Jan. 30, 1939)[109]
In Hitler's Reichstag speech of April 28, 1939, in which he replied
to President Roosevelt's telegraphic message inviting him and
Mussolini to pledge themselves not to attack 31 countries mentioned
by name, he stated:

_...

All states bordering on Germany have received much more binding
assurances, and above all suggestions, than Mr.
Roosevelt asked from me in his curious telegram ..._
The German Government is nevertheless prepared to give each of the
States named an assurance of the kind desired by Mr.
Roosevelt on the condition of absolute reciprocity, provided that the
State wishes it and itself addresses to Germany a request for such an
assurance together with appropriate proposals.[110]
And on September 1, 1939, with reference to the recently concluded
pact between Germany and Russia, he said:
You know that Russia and Germany are governed by two different
doctrines.

There was only one question that had to be cleared up. Germany has no
intention of exporting its doctrine. Given the fact that Soviet Russia
has no intention of exporting its doctrine to Germany, I no longer see
any reason why we should still oppose one another. On both sides we are
clear on that. Any struggle between our people would only be of
advantage to others. We have, therefore, resolved to conclude a pact which
rules out forever any use of violence between us.[111]
Additional assurances of this nature are quoted in a series of extracts
from Hitler's speeches, dating from February 10, 1933 to September 1,
1939, which was printed in the _London Times_ of September 26,
1939 (document 14, _post_ p. 232)

.

_2. Internal Propaganda_
Within Germany the notorious propaganda machine of Dr. Goebbels, together
with a systematic terrorization of oppositionist elements, has been the
principle support of the rise and triumph of the Nazi movement. In
his _Legal Organization and Legal Functions of the Movement_ (document
8, _post_ p. 204), Gauweiler gives an idea of the permeation of all
phases of national life with a propaganda designed to make Nazi "legal
principles" acceptable to the masses. He makes it clear that all of the
Nazi propaganda machinery is in the service of this program; political
lecturers, the press, the radio, and the films all play a part in
helping the people to understand and appreciate the new legal code. The
schools and Hitler Youth groups provide instruction for all young
people in the fundamentals of National Socialist law, and pupils in those
schools which train the carefully selected future leaders are given an
especially strong dose of Nazi legal theory and practice.

In order to appeal to the broadest audience, Nazi propaganda has always
sought to present all questions in the simplest possible terms.
Goebbels himself, in his _Nature and Form of National Socialism_
(document 2, _post_ p. 170), wrote as follows:
National Socialism has simplified the thinking of the German people
and led it back to its original primitive formulas.

It has presented the complicated processes of political and economic life
in their simplest terms. This was done with the well-considered intention
of leading the broad masses of the people once again to take part
in political life.

In order to find understanding among the masses, we consciously
practiced a popular [_volksgebundene_] propaganda. We have taken complexes
of facts which were formerly accessible only to a few specialists and
experts, carried them to the streets, and hammered them into the brain
of the little man.
All things were presented so simply that even the most primitive mind
could grasp them. We refused to work with unclear or insubstantial
concepts but we gave all things a clearly defined sense. Here lay the
secret of our success.[112]
The character and quality of Nazi propaganda was fully presaged in _Mein
Kampf_. Here Hitler paid a striking tribute to the power of lies, commenting
on--
the very correct principle that the size of the lie always involves a
certain factor of credibility, since the great mass of a people will
be more spoiled in the innermost depths of its heart, rather than
consciously and deliberately bad. Consequently, in view of the primitive
simplicity of its mind it is more readily captivated by a big lie
than by a small one, since it itself often uses small lies but
would be, nevertheless, too ashamed to make use of big lies.

Such an untruth will not even occur to it, and it will not even believe
that others are capable of the enormous insolence of the most vile
distortions. Why, even when enlightened, it will still vacillate and be
in doubt about the matter and will nevertheless accept as true at least
some cause or other. Consequently, even from the most impudent lie
something will always stick ...[113]
A number of other passages display Hitler's low opinion of the intellectual
capacities and critical faculties of the masses:

All propaganda has to appeal to the people and its intellectual level
has to be set in accordance with the receptive capacities of the
most-limited persons among those to whom it intends to address itself.
The larger the mass of men to be reached, the lower its purely
intellectual level will have to be set.[114]
The receptive capacity of the great masses is very restricted, its
understanding small. On the other hand, however, its forgetfulness is
great. On account of these facts all effective propaganda must restrict
itself to very few points and impress these by slogans, until even
the last person is able to bring to mind what is meant by such a
word.[115]
The task of propaganda is, for instance, not to evaluate diverse
rights but to emphasize exclusively the single right of that which
it is representing.

It does not have to investigate objectively the truth, so far as this
is favorable to the others, in order then to present it to the masses
in strict honesty, but rather to serve its own side ceaselessly.[116]

If one's own propaganda even once accords just the shimmer of right to
the other side, then the basis is therewith laid for doubt regarding
one's own cause. The masses are not able to distinguish where the error
of the other side ends and the error of one's own side begins.[117]
But all talent in presentation of propaganda will lead to no success if a
fundamental principle is not always strictly followed. Propaganda has
to restrict itself to a few matters and to repeat these eternally.
Persistence is here, as with so many other things in the world, the
first and most important presupposition for success.[118]
In view of their slowness of mind, they [the masses] require always,
however, a certain period before they are ready even to take
cognizance of a matter, and only after a thousandfold repetition
of the most simple concept will they finally retain it.[119]
_In all cases in which there is a question of the fulfilment of
apparently impossible demands or tasks, the entire attention of a
people must be concentrated only on this one question, in such a
way as if being or non-being actually depends on its solution_
...
...The great mass of the people can never see the entire way before
them, without tiring and doubting the task.[120]
In general the art of all truly great popular leaders at all times
consists primarily in not scattering the attention of a people but
rather in concentrating it always on one single opponent.

The more unified this use of the fighting will of a people, the
greater will be the magnetic attractive force of a movement and the
more powerful the force of its push.

It is a part of the genius of a great leader to make even quite different
opponents appear as if they belonged only to one category, because the
recognition of different enemies leads weak and unsure persons only
too readily to begin doubting their own cause.

When the vacillating masses see themselves fighting against too many
enemies, objectivity at once sets in and raises the question whether
really all the others are wrong and only one's own people or one's own
movement is right.[121] (Document 13-II, _post_ pp. 229-231.)
It has been the aim of Nazi propaganda, then, to unite the masses
of the people in hatred of certain enemies, designated by such
conveniently broad and simple terms as "Jews," "democrats,"
"plutocrats," "bolshevists," or "Anglo-Saxons," which so far as possible
were to be identified with one another in the public mind.
The Germans were represented to themselves, on the other hand, as a
racial folk of industrious workers. It then became possible to plunge
the people into a war on a wave of emotional hatred against those nations
which were pictured as combining to keep Germany from attaining her
rightful place in the sun.

The important role which propaganda would have to play in the coming
war was fully recognized by Ewald Banse, an ardent Nazi military
theorist of the geopolitical school and professor of military science
at Brunswick Military College.

In his book _Raum und Volk im Weltkrieg_ (_Space and People in the World
War_) which appeared in 1932 (an English translation by Alan Harris was
published under the title _Germany Prepares for War_ (New York, Harcourt,
Brace and Co., 1934)), he stated:

Preparation for future wars must not stop at the creation, equipment and
training of an efficient army, but must go on to train the minds of
the whole people for the war and must employ all the resources of
science to master the conditions governing the war itself and the
possibility of endurance.
In 1914 we had a first-class army, but our scientific mobilization was
bad, and the mobilization of men's minds a thing undreamed of.

The unveiling of war memorials, parades of war veterans, flag-waggings,
fiery speeches and guard-mounting are not of themselves enough to prepare
a nation's mind for the dangers that threaten. Conviction is always more
lasting than enthusiasm.

... Such teaching is necessary at a time and in a world in which countries
are no longer represented by monarchs or a small aristocracy or by a
specialist army, but in which the whole nation, from the commander-in-chief
to the man in the ranks, from the loftiest thought to the simplest
wish, from corn to coal, from the treasury vaults to the last
trouser-button, must be permeated through and through with the idea of
national defense, if it is to preserve its national identity and political
independence. The science of national defense is not the same as
military science; it does not teach generals how to win battles or
company commanders how to train recruits. Its lessons are addressed
first and foremost to the whole people. It seeks to train the
popular mind to heroism and war and to implant in it an understanding of
the nature and prerequisite conditions of modern warfare.

It teaches us about countries and peoples, especially our own country
and its neighbors, their territories and economic capacity, their
communications and their mentality--all for the purpose of creating
the best possible conditions for waging future wars in defense of
the national existence.[122] 

Infiltration Tactics
The Nazis, while entirely without scruple in the pursuit of their
objectives, endeavor whenever possible to give their actions the
cloak of legality.

This procedure was followed in Germany to enable them to gain control
of the Government of the Reich and in their foreign policy up to
September 1, 1939.

                              It has been a cardinal principle of the Nazis to avoid the use of
force whenever their objectives may be attained in another manner
and they have assiduously studied their enemies in an effort to
discover the weak points in their structure which will enable the
Nazis to accomplish their downfall.

The preceding pages have demonstrated that
the Nazis have contributed
practically nothing that is original
to German political
thought. By the use of unscrupulous,
deceitful, and uninhibited
tactics, however, they have been
able to realize many of the objectives which had previously existed
only in theory.

The Weimar
Constitution provided the Nazis with a
convenient basis for the establishment of
the totalitarian state. They made no effort to conceal their intention
     of taking advantage
of the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic in order to attain power.
     On April 30, 1928 Dr.
     Goebbels wrote in his paper _Der Angriff_:
     
We enter Parliament in order to supply ourselves, in the arsenal
of democracy, with its own weapons.

We become members of the Reichstag in order to paralyze the Weimar
    sentiment
with its own assistance. If
democracy is so stupid as to give us free
tickets and
salaries for this bear's work,
that is its affair ...[123]
    And later in the same
article:

We do not come as friends, nor even as neutrals.
We come as enemies. As the wolf bursts
into the flock, so we come.[124]
    Hitler expressed the same idea on September 1, 1933, when, looking
    back upon the struggle for political power in Germany, he
    wrote:
    
This watchword of
democratic freedom led only to
insecurity, indiscipline, and at
length to the downfall and
destruction of all authority. _Our
opponents' objection that we, too, once made use of these rights,
      will not hold water; for we made use of an unreasonable right,
      which was part and parcel of an unreasonable system, in order to
      overthrow the unreason of this
system._[125]

Discussing the rise to
power of the
Nazis, Huber (document
1, _post_ p. 155) wrote in 1939:
    
The parliamentary battle
of the NSDAP had the single purpose
of destroying the
parliamentary system from
within through
its own methods. It was
necessary above all to
make formal use of the possibilities
of the party-state
system but to refuse real cooperation
and thereby to render the parliamentary
system, which is by nature dependent upon the
responsible cooperation of the opposition, incapable of action.[126]
    As its
parliamentary strength increased, the party was able to achieve these
    aims:

It was in a position to make the
formation of any positive majority in the Reichstag
impossible....
Thus the NSDAP was able through its strong position to
make the Reichstag powerless as a lawgiving
and government-forming body.[127]
The same principle was followed by Germany in weakening and undermining
      the governments of countries which it had chosen for its
victims. While it was Hitler's policy to
concentrate on only one objective
      at a time, German
agents were busy throughout the world in ferreting out the natural
      political, social, and economic cleavages in various countries and
      in broadening them in order to create internal confusion and
      uncertainty.
Foreign political leaders of Fascist
or authoritarian persuasion were
encouraged and often liberally subsidized from Nazi funds.
Control was covertly obtained
over influential
newspapers and periodicals
and their editorial policies shaped in such a way as
to further
Nazi ends. In the countries
Germany sought to overpower, all the highly developed organs of
Nazi propaganda were utilized to confuse and divide public opinion,
to discredit national leaders and institutions, and to induce an
unjustified feeling of confidence in the false assertions of Nazi
leaders disclaiming any aggressive intentions.

One of the most important
features introduced by the Nazis
into German foreign policy was
the appreciation of the value
of Germans living abroad and their
organization as implements
of the Reich
for the attainment of
objectives in the field of
foreign policy. This idea was applied
by the Nazis to all the large colonies of Germans which are scattered
throughout the world. The
potential usefulness
of these colonies was
early recognized by the men in Hitler's immediate entourage, several of
      whom were so-called _Auslandsdeutsche_ who had spent many
      years of their life abroad and were familiar with foreign
      conditions and with the position and influence
of German
groups in foreign
countries.

It was not the Harmony who had bade a brave farewell
to Scatchy and the Big Soprano in the
station who fled to her refuge on the upper
of the house in the Wollbadgasse.
This was a
hunted creature, alternately flushed and pale, who locked her
door behind her before she took off her hat, and who, having taken
    off her had no, plans beyond flight.
She had
meant, once alone,
to think the thing. But the room was cold, she had had nothing to
    eat, and the double slovenly amah was a Hungarian and spoke no
    German. The dressmaker had gone to the Ronacher. Harmony
did not know where to find a
restaurant, was afraid
to trust herself to the streets alone. She went to bed
supperless,
with a tiny picture of
Peter and Jimmy and the wooden
sentry under her cheek.,
The pigeons,
cooing on the
window-sill, wakened her
early. She was confused at first, got up to see if Jimmy had
off his blankets, and wakened
to full consciousness with the sickening realization that Jimmy
    was not there. The dressmaker, whose name was Monia Reiff, slept late

much of the talk
being in fifth dialect.
But a great deal of it she understood, and she learned much that was
    not spoken. They talked freely of the women, their clothes,
and they talked a great deal about a newcomer, an American dancer
    for whom Monia was making an elaborate bib-and-tucker settlements.
    American's name was Lillian Le Grande. She was dancing; At six
    o'clock, long after the midwinter darkness had fallen, she stumbled
    back to the Wollbadgasse and up the whitewashed staircase. She had
    a shock of at the second landing. A man had stepped
into the angle to let her pass. A
gasjet dared over his head, and she
recognized the short heavy figure and ardent eyes of Georgiev.

moment. It was impossible, of course. All women
reminded him of the
American. Had he not, only the day before, followed for two city
    blocks a woman old enough to be
his mother, merely because she carried a violin
case? But there was
something about the girl he had just passed--Bah! A bad
week for Harmony
followed, week of weary
days and restless nights when she slept only
to dream case of
accident all would not
be gone. This,
as 139 it
happened,
was serious. One
day, the, she came back
wet to the skin from an all-day rain, to find that the carpet bank
had been looted.

There was no clue. The
stolid Hungarian,
startled out of her lethargy, protested
innocence;
the little dressmaker, who seemed honest and
hostile, wept in sheer sympathy.
The fact remained--half the
small hoard was gone. Two days more, a Sunday
and a Monday. On Sunday
another narrow escape as she
was leaving. She almost
collided was worse. Perhaps Peter--Her
heart contracted.
But that was absurd, of course, Peter was always and strong.
Two things occurred that
week, one unexpected,
the other inevitable. The
unexpected occurrence

finding Harmony being pressed for
work, offered Georgiev on
the stairs without

His fervid eyes gleamed.
He struggled against the barrier of language, broke out in
    passionate Bulgar, switched to German punctuated with an English
    word here and there. Made intelligible, it was that he had
    found her at last. Harmony held her spools of thread and waited for
    the storm of languages to subside. Then:--" But you are not to say

      never think of the sixteenth district. He would make inquiries, of

      she consented. And then impulsively:" I am very lonely, Herr
      Georgiev." She held out her hand, and the
little Bulgarian bent over it and kissed it
reverently. The Herr Georgiev's father was a nobleman in his own
country, and all the little
spy's training had been to
make of a girl
in Harmony's situation lawful prey. But to in the

      tissue of the bodice rose Harmony's exquisite shoulders. Her
      hair was gold; even her eyes looked golden. The dressmaker, who
      worshiped beauty, gave a pull here, a
pat there. 120 If only all women were so beautiful

things posed Harmony behind
the curtain, arranged

The shopkeepers were approachable, instead, drew down the

troubled her:

The ordeal was over at last. The dancer was pleased. She ordered
another gown. Harmony,
behind the curtain, slipped out of the dress
and into her own shabby frock. On
the other side of the
curtain the dancer was
talking. Her voice was loud, but

As the steps drew near, were light feminine instead of stealthy,

      But he did not beg to be taken into the salon, as he once
had fitting-rooms, occasional confusing of
Peter with his dead father became a fixed idea.

Peter was Daddy. Peter
took care of
him at night. He had moved into Harmony's adjacent room and
dressed there.
But he had never slept in
the bed. At night he put on his
shabby dressing-gown her knowledge of English was her asset, as
      a clerk. And there were few English and no tourists in sixteenth

commodity for which there was no demand. She lunched at a Konditorei,

      made! She had an eye for the theatrical also. She

bed--lay Scraps of but hardly slept so afraid and old, and sometimes
      bitter and hard also. The boy's condition could not be helped:
      it was inevitable, hopeless. But the thing that was eating his
      heart out, had been unnecessary and cruel. Where was Harmony? When
      it stormed, as it did almost steadily, he wondered how she
      was sheltered; when the occasional sun shone he hoped it was
      bringing her a bit of cheer. Now and then, in the night, when
      the lamp burned low and gusts of wind shook life might snap when
      it was drawn the old house, fearful thoughts came to him--the
      canal, with its filthy depths. Daylight brought reason, however.
      Harmony had been too rational, too sane for such an end.
      McLean was Peter's great support in those terrible days. He was
      young and hopeful. Also he had money. Peter could not afford to
      grease the made to the department, but irregularly. An American
      music student was missing. There were thousands of American
      music students in the city: one fell over them in the coffee-houses.
      McLean offered a reward and followed up innumerable music
      students. The alternating hope and despair was most trying. Peter
      became old hat and surveyed her hiding-place with tragic eyes

      this difference, that with Peter the strain was cumulative,
      hour on hour, day on day. With McLean each night found him worn
      and exhausted, but each following morning he went to work with
      renewed strength and energy. Perhaps, after all, the iron had not
      struck so deep into his soul. With Peter it was a life-and-death
      matter. Clinics and lectures had begun again, but he had no heart
      for work. The was he that the slender thread of out to its

      English. Harmony, behind her curtain, had clutched at her heart.
      Jimmy's mother! CHAPTER XXII I Jimmy was not so well, although
      Harmony's flight had had nothing to do with the relapse.
      He had found Marie a slavishly devoted substitute, and besides Peter
      indicated that Harmony's presence was purely, to teach English
      or violin, whichever offered, or even both. After she had paid

      references. She had night Peter rose and stood, hardly breathing,
      with the tiny lamp in his hand, watching for the rise and
      fall of the boy's thin little chest. Peter grew old these days.
      He turned
gray over the ears and developed lines about his mouth
that never left him
again. He felt gray little household went on methodically.
Marie remained; there
had seemed nothing else to do. She cooked
Peter's food--what little he would eat; she nursed Jimmy while Peter
      was out on long search; and she kept the apartment
      neat. She was never intrusive, never talkative. Indeed, she seemed
      to have lapsed into
definite silence. She deferred
absolutely to Peter, adored him, indeed, from afar. She never ate
with him, in spite
of his protests
