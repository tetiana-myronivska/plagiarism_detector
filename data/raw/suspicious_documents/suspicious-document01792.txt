wall, crowded to the table. "How is your catarrh?"--"Please your
honour, no offence, I hope, it is the Asthma. I have no rest night and
day, and"--Ah, so it is the Asthma; it is somebody else that has the
Catarrh. Well you have been ordered to take, &c.--"Yes, Sir, but I
grow worse and worse, and"--That is nothing, you must go on with it.
"But Sir, indeed, I cannot." Enough, enough, good woman, I cannot
listen to you any more; many patients to get through this
morning--never do to hear them talk--go and take your draught.--The
Catarrh woman made way for a long train of victims of corruption,
cases of fever, dropsy, scrofula, and some disorders peculiar to
women, detailed without any ceremony before young students. This
melancholy review of human infirmities was suddenly interrupted by the
unexpected entrance of a surgeon, followed by several young men,
carrying a piece of bloody flesh on a dish. They took all her nice
clothes. They said they took all niggers. I sassed them. They went
in another room. I shot under Miss Betty's big skirt. They looked about
for me but they thought I run off to my mama. She was gone but
they didn't know it. I seen my best times then. We had a good time
there. Miss Betty was good and kind to me. Good as I wanted. I
wish I had that good now.

Freedom
"The soldiers come and I knowed it was the Yankees I hated. They took
all they could find and wasted a lot of it. I was scared. I kept
hid about. The slaves put their beds and clothes up on the wagons
and went off behind them and some clumb up in the wagons. I heard
Miss Betty say, 'They need not follow them off, they are already
free.'The women being dispatched, 20 or 30 male spectres came in, and
underwent the same sort of summary examination. The only case I
recollect was that of a man attacked with violent palpitations,
accompanied with great pain in the shoulders. His heart was felt
beating hard through the sternum, or even under the ribs on the right
side. "His heart has moved from its place!" The unhappy man thrown
back on an arm chair--his breast uncovered--pale as death--fixed his
fearful eyes on the physicians, who successively came to feel the
pulsations of the breast, and reason on the cause. me nearly cry and

At circumference an obscure sound when under knowing not which she

crowded, which is no doubt of the greatest importance. I was shocked,
however, with the same appearance of insensibility and precipitation.
