THE WORKS OF CORNELIUS TACITUS;

WITH

AN ESSAY ON HIS LIFE AND GENIUS,
NOTES, SUPPLEMENTS, &c.

BY
ARTHUR MURPHY, ESQ.


     Præcipuum munus annalium reor, ne virtutes sileantur, utque pravis
     dictis factisque ex posteritate et infamiâ metus sit.
                                          She does not like to live in a wretched hovel any longer; she would
like to have a cottage."

"Go, then," said
the Flounder, "she has it already."

When the man went home, his wife was no longer in the hovel, but,
instead of it, there stood a small cottage, and she was sitting on
a bench before the door.

Then she took him by the hand and said to him, "Just come inside,
look, now isn't this a great deal better?"

So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a pretty little parlor
and bedroom and a kitchen and pantry, with the best of furniture, and
fitted up with the most beautiful things made of tin and brass,
whatsoever was wanted.

And behind the cottage there was a small yard, with hens and ducks,
and a little garden with flowers and fruit.

"Look," said the wife, "is not that nice!"

"Yes," said the husband, "and so we must always think it; now we
will live quite contented."

"We will think about that," said the wife.

With that they ate something and went to bed.

Everything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the woman
said, "Hark you, husband, this cottage is far too small for us,
and the garden and yard are little; the Flounder might just as well
have given us a larger house.

I should like to live in a great stone castle; go to the Flounder, and
tell him to give us a castle."

"Ah, wife," said the man, "the cottage is quite good enough; why should
we live in a castle?"

"What!" said the woman; "just go there, the Flounder can always do
that."

"No, wife," said the man, "the Flounder has just given us the
cottage; I do not like to go back so soon.
It might make him angry."

"Go," said the woman, "he can do it quite easily, and will be glad to
do it; just you go to him."

The man's heart grew heavy, and he would not go.

He said to himself, "It is not right," and yet he went. And when he
came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark-blue, and gray
and thick, and no longer green and yellow; but it was still quiet.

And he stood there and said--
"Flounder, Flounder, in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me; For my
wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I'd have her will."
"Well, what does she want, then?" said the Flounder. "Alas," said the
man, half scared, "she wants to live in a great stone castle."

"Go to it, then, she is standing before the door," said the Flounder.

Then the man went away, intending to go home, but when he got there,
he found a great stone palace, and his wife was just standing on
the steps going in, and she took him by the hand and said, "Come in."

So he went in with her, and in the castle was a great hall paved with
marble, and many servants, who flung wide the doors; and the walls
were all bright with beautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs
and tables of pure gold, and crystal chandeliers hung from the
ceiling, and all the rooms and bedrooms had carpets, and food
and wine of the very best were standing on all the tables so that
they nearly broke down beneath it.

Behind the house, too, there was a great courtyard, with stables for
horses and cows, and the very best of carriages; there was a
magnificent large garden, too, with the most beautiful flowers and
fruit-trees, and a park quite half a mile long, in which were
stags, deer, and hares, and everything that could be desired.

"Come," said the woman, "isn't that beautiful?" "Yes, indeed," said
the man; "now let it be; we will live in this beautiful castle and
be content."

"We will consider about that," said the woman, "and sleep upon it;"
thereupon they went to bed.

Next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just daybreak, and
from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her.

Her husband was still stretching himself, so she poked him in
the side with her elbow, and said, "Get up, husband, and just peep
out of the window.
Look you, couldn't we be the King over all that land?

Go to the Flounder, we will be the King." "Ah, wife," said the
man, "why should we be King? I do not want to be King."
Messala describes the presumption of the young advocates on their
first appearance at the bar; their want of legal knowledge, and the
absurd habits which they contracted in the schools of the
rhetoricians.

2. Eloquence totally ruined by the preceptors. Messala concludes with
desiring Secundus and Maternus to assign the reasons which have
occurred to them.

4. Secundus gives his opinion. The change of government produced a new
mode of eloquence. The orators under the emperors endeavoured to be
ingenious rather than natural. Seneca the first who introduced a false
taste, which still prevailed in the reign of Vespasian.

8. Licinius Largus taught the advocates of his time the disgraceful
art of hiring applauders by profession. This was the bane of all true
oratory, and, for that reason, Maternus was right in renouncing the
forum altogether.

10. Is it that you may renew the pleasure by perpetrating the
same violence on the disciples of Nature?"
Nature was to them not merely a dumb, but an altogether lifeless
image, in whose inmost being even no living word dwelt; a hollow
scaffolding of forms, of which as hollow an image was to be transferred
to the canvas, or hewn out of stone.

This was the proper doctrine of those more ancient and savage nations,
who, as they saw in Nature nothing divine, fetched idols out of
her; whilst, to the susceptive Greeks, who everywhere felt the
presence of a vitally efficient principle, genuine gods arose out
of Nature.

But is, then, the disciple of Nature to copy everything in Nature
without distinction?--and, of everything, every part? Only beautiful
objects should be represented; and, even in these, only the Beautiful
and Perfect.

Thus is the proposition further determined, but, at the same time, this
asserted, that, in Nature, the perfect is mingled with the imperfect,
the beautiful with the unbeautiful.

Now, how should he who stands in no other relation to Nature than that
of servile imitation, distinguish the one from the other? It is the
way of imitators to appropriate the faults of their model sooner
and easier than its excellences, since the former offer handles and
tokens more easily grasped; and thus we see that imitators of Nature
in this sense have imitated oftener, and even more affectionately,
the ugly than the beautiful.

If we regard in things, not their principle, but the empty abstract
form, neither will they say anything to our soul; our own heart, our
own spirit we must put to it, that they answer us.

But what is the perfection of a thing? Nothing else than the
creative life in it, its power to exist.

Never, therefore, will he, who fancies that Nature is altogether dead,
be successful in that profound process (analogous to the chemical)
whence proceeds, purified as by fire, the pure gold of Beauty and
Truth.

Nor was there any change in the main view of the relation of Art to
Nature, even when the unsatisfactoriness of the principle began
to be more generally felt; no change, even by the new views and new
knowledge so nobly established by John Winckelmann.

He indeed restored to the soul its full efficiency in Art, and
raised it from its unworthy dependence into the realm of spiritual
freedom.

Powerfully moved by the beauty of form in the works of antiquity,
he taught that the production of ideal Nature, of Nature elevated
above the Actual, together with the expression of spiritual
conceptions, is the highest aim of Art.

     But if we examine in what sense this surpassing of the Actual by
Art has been understood by the most, it turns out that, with this
view also, the notion of Nature as mere product, of things as a
lifeless result, still continued; and the idea of a living creative
Nature was in no wise awakened by it.

         Thus these ideal forms also could be animated by no positive
                                                           insight into their nature; and if the forms of the Actual were
dead for the dead beholder, these were not less so.

Were no independent production of the Actual possible, neither would
there be of the Ideal.

The object of the imitation was changed; the imitation remained.
What they said upon the occasion, I
shall relate, as nearly as may be, in the style and manner of the
several speakers, observing always the regular course and order of the
controversy. For a controversy it certainly was, where the speakers of
the present age did not want an advocate, who supported their cause
with zeal, and, after treating antiquity with sufficient freedom, and
even derision, assigned the palm of eloquence to the practisers of
modern times.

time, expect your patronage; the colonies [b] invoke your aid, and the
municipal cities invite you to the bar. And surely the weight of so
many causes may be deemed sufficient, without this new solicitude
imposed upon you by Domitius [c] or Cato. And must you thus waste all
your time, amusing yourself for ever with scenes of fictitious
distress, and still labouring to add to the fables of Greece the
incidents and characters of the Roman story?

Secure in his own strength, he knows how to ward off every
danger. His own genius is his protection; a perpetual guard, that
watches him; an invincible power, that shields him from his enemies.
