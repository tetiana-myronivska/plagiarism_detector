It is those who by faith follow Jesus in the great work of the atonement,
who receive the benefits of His mediation in their behalf; while those who
reject the light which brings to view this work of ministration, are not
benefited thereby. The Jews who rejected the light given at Christ's first
advent, and refused to believe on Him as the Saviour of the world, could
not receive pardon through Him. When Jesus at His ascension entered by His
own blood into the heavenly sanctuary to shed upon His disciples the
blessings of His mediation, the Jews were left in total darkness, to
continue their useless sacrifices and offerings. The ministration of types
and shadows had ceased. That door by which men had formerly found access
to God, was no longer open. The Jews had refused to seek Him in the only
way whereby He could then be found, through the ministration in the
sanctuary in heaven. Therefore they found no communion with God. To them
the door was shut. They had no knowledge of Christ as the true sacrifice
and the only mediator before God; hence they could not receive the
benefits of His mediation.

The condition of the unbelieving Jews illustrates the condition of the
careless and unbelieving among professed Christians, who are willingly
ignorant of the work of our merciful High Priest. In the typical service,
when the high priest entered the most holy place, all Israel were required
to gather about the sanctuary, and in the most solemn manner humble their
souls before God, that they might receive the pardon of their sins, and
not be cut off from the congregation. How much more essential in this
antitypical day of atonement that we understand the work of our High
Priest, and know what duties are required of us.

Men cannot with impunity reject the warnings which God in mercy sends
them. A message was sent from heaven to the world in Noah's day, and their
salvation depended upon the manner in which they treated that message.
Because they rejected the warning, the Spirit of God was withdrawn from
the sinful race, and they perished in the waters of the flood. No; I could
think of nothing of the sort, so I felt a little easier.
Suddenly, however, she glanced up and, looking straight at me, began:

"Mr. Heming . . . we have only one child . . . and we love her dearly . .
."
But the pause that followed was so long drawn out that I began to lose
interest, especially as the flies were once more humming the same old tune.
A little later, however, I was almost startled when Mrs. Spear exclaimed:

"But I'll lend you a photograph of Athabasca for six weeks!"
Thereupon Mrs.

Spear left her chair and going upstairs presently returned with a photograph
wrapped in a silk handkerchief; and as at that very moment the Free Trader
and his daughter entered the room, I, without comment, slipped the
photograph into my inside pocket, and wished them all good-bye;
though they insisted upon walking down to the landing to wave me
farewell on my way to Fort Consolation.

MUSTERING THE FUR BRIGADE
Next morning, soon after dawn, the church bells were ringing and
everyone was up and astir; and presently all were on their way to
one or another of the little log chapels on the hill; where, a little later,
they saw the stalwart men of the Fur Brigade kneeling before the altar as
they partook of the holy sacrament before starting upon their voyage
to the frontier of civilization.

Strange, isn't it, that the writers of northern novels never depict a scene
like that? Probably because they have never been inside a northern
church.

Next, breakfasts were hurriedly eaten, then the voyageurs assembled upon
the beach placed those big, beautifully formed, six-fathom canoes
upon the water, and paddled them to the landing.

Then Chief Factor Thompson and Factor Mackenzie joined the throng;
and that veteran voyageur, Oo-koo-hoo, who was to command the Fur
Brigade, touched his hat and conversed with the officers.

                     A few moments later the old guide waved his swarthy men into line.

From them he chose the bowmen, calling each by name, and motioning them to
rank beside him; then, in turn, each bowman selected a man for his crew;
until, for each of the eight canoes, eight men were chosen. Then work
began.

Some went off with tump-line in hand to the warehouse, ascended the massive
stairs, and entered the fur loft. Tiers of empty shelves circled the room,
where the furs were stored during the winter; but upon the floor were
stacked packs of valuable pelts--the harvest of the fur trade. The old-fashioned
scales, the collapsible mould, and the giant fur press told of the work
that had been done. Every pack weighed eighty pounds. Loading up, they
rapidly carried the fur to the landing. In the storeroom the voyageurs
gathered up the "tripping" kit of paddles, tents, axes, tarpaulins,
sponges; and a box for each crew containing frying-pans, tea pails, tin
plates, and tea-dishes.

In the trading room the crews were supplied with provisions of flour, pork,
and tea, at the rate of three pounds a day for each man. They were also
given tobacco. Most of the voyageurs received "advances" from the clerk
in the way of clothing, knives, pipes, and things deemed essential for
the voyage. Birch bark, spruce roots, and gum were supplied for repairing
the canoes.

All was now in readiness.

The loading of freight began, and when each canoe had received its allotted
cargo the voyageurs indulged in much handshaking with their friends, a
little quiet talking and affectionate kissing with their families and
sweethearts. Then, paddle in hand, they boarded their canoes and took
their places.

In manning a six-fathom canoe the bowman is always the most important; the
steersman comes next in rank, while the others are called "midmen."

DEPARTURE OF THE FUR BRIGADE
Factor Mackenzie and his senior officer, sitting in the guide's or
chief voyageur's canoe, which, of course, was Oo-koo-hoo's, gave
the word; and all together the paddle blades dipped, the water
swirled, and on the gunwales the paddle handles thudded as the
canoes heaved away.

The going and coming of the Fur Brigade was the one great event of the
year to those nomadic people who stood watching and waving to the
fast-vanishing flotilla. Were they not bidding farewell to fathers, husbands,
brothers, sons, or lovers, chosen as the best men from their village? Had
they not lent a hand in the winning of the treasure that was floating
away? If only the pelts in those packs could speak, what tales they would
unfold!

As I looked back the animated picture of the little settlement wherein we
figured but a moment before gradually faded into distance. The wild-looking
assembly was blotted from the shore. But still above the rapidly dwindling
buildings waved the flag of the oldest chartered trading association in
the world--the Hudson's Bay Company.

Between eleven and twelve o'clock the brigade went ashore for a "snack."
The canoes were snubbed to overhanging trees, and upon a rocky flat the
fires burned. Hurriedly drinking the hot tea, the men seized pieces
of frying pork and, placing them upon their broken bannock, ravenously
devoured both as they returned to the canoes.

No time was lost. Away we went again. Then the brigade would paddle
incessantly for about two hours; then they would "spell", and paddles were
laid aside "one smoke." As the way slackened the steersmen bunched
the canoes. The soft, rich voices of the crews blended as they quietly
chatted and joked and laughed together.

Later, a stern wind came along. Nearing an island, some of the men went
ashore and cut a mast and sprit-sail boom for each canoe. They lashed
the masts to the thwarts with tump-lines, and rigged the tarpaulins,
used to cover the packs, into sails.

Again the paddles were shipped, save those of the steersmen; and the crews
lounged about, either smoking or drowsing. The men were weary. Last
night they had danced both hard and long, with dusky maids--as all
true voyageurs do on the eve of their departure. To voyageurs stern winds
are blessings.
Mile after mile the wild flotilla swept along. Sunshine danced upon the
rippling waves that gurgled and lapped as the bows overreached them.
Rugged islands of moss-covered rock and evergreen trees rose on every
side. The wind favoured us for about five miles, then shifted.
Reluctantly the sails were let down, and masts and booms tossed overboard.
At four o'clock the brigade landed on a pretty island, and a hurried
afternoon tea was taken; after which we again paddled on, and at sundown
halted to pitch camp for the night.

CAMP OF THE FUR BRIGADE
The canoes--held off shore so as not to damage them by touching the
beach--were unloaded by men wading in the water. The fur packs were
neatly piled and covered with tarpaulins. Then the canoes were lifted off
the water, and carried ashore, and turned upside-down for the night. Tents
were erected and campfires lit. Upon a thick carpet of evergreen brush the
blankets were spread in the tents. The tired men sat in the smoke at the
fires and ate their suppers round which black flies and mosquitoes
hovered.

Canadian voyageurs, being well used to both fasting and feasting, display
great appetites when savoury food is plentiful, and though I have seen
much feasting and heard astonishing tales of great eating, I feel I
cannot do better than quote the following, as told by Charles Mair, one
of the co-authors of that reliable book "Through the Mackenzie Basin":

"I have already hinted at those masterpieces of voracity for which
the region is renowned; yet the undoubted facts related around our
campfires, and otherwise, a few of which follow, almost beggar
belief.

Mr. Young, of our party, an old Hudson's Bay officer, knew of sixteen trackers
who, in a few days, consumed eight bears, two moose, two bags of pemmican,
two sacks of flour, and three sacks of potatoes. Bishop Grouard vouched
for four men eating a reindeer at a sitting. Our friend, Mr. d'Eschambault,
once gave Oskinnegu,--'The Young Man'--six pounds of pemmican. He ate
it all at a meal, washing it down with a gallon of tea, and then complained
that he had not had enough. Sir George Simpson states that at Athabasca
Lake, in 1820, he was one of a party of twelve who ate twenty-two geese and
three ducks at a single meal. But, as he says, they had been three
whole days without food.
The Saskatchewan folk, however, known of old as the Gens de Blaireaux--'The
People of the Badger Holes'--were not behind their congeners. That man
of weight and might, our old friend Chief Factor Belanger, once served
out to thirteen men a sack of pemmican weighing ninety pounds. It
was enough for three days; but there and then they sat down and
consumed it all at a single meal, not, it must be added, without
some subsequent and just pangs of indigestion.

Mr. B., having occasion to pass the place of eating, and finding the
sack of pemmican, as he supposed, in his path, gave it a kick; but,
to his amazement, it bounded aloft several feet, and then lit. It was
empty! When it is remembered that in the old buffalo days the daily ration
per head at the Company's prairie posts was eight pounds of fresh meat,
which was all eaten, its equivalent being two pounds of pemmican, the
enormity of this Gargantuan feast may be imagined. But we ourselves were
not bad hands at the trencher. In fact, we were always hungry. So I do
not reproduce the foregoing facts as a reproach, but rather as a meagre
tribute to the prowess of the great of old--the men of unbounded stomach!"

And yet, strange as it may seem, fat men are seldom seen in the northern
wilderness. That is something movie directors should remember.

Pemmican, though little used nowadays, was formerly the mainstay of the
voyageurs. It was made of the flesh of buffalo, musk-ox, moose,
caribou, wapiti, beaver, rabbit, or ptarmigan; and for ordinary use was
composed of 66 per cent. of dried meat pounded fine to 34 per cent.
of hard fat boiled and strained. A finer quality of pemmican for officers
or travellers was composed of 60 per cent. of dried meat pounded extra
fine and sifted; 33 per cent. of grease taken from marrow bones boiled
and strained; 5 per cent. of dried Saskatoon berries; 2 per cent. of dried
choke cherries, and sugar according to taste. The pounded meat was placed
in a large wooden trough and, being spread out, hot grease was poured over
it and then stirred until thoroughly mixed with the meat. Then, after first
letting it cool somewhat, the whole was packed into leather bags, and, with
the aid of wooden mallets, driven down into a solid mass, when the bags
were sewn up and flattened out and left to cool; during the cooling
precaution was taken to turn the bags every five minutes to prevent the
grease settling too much to one side.

Pemmican was packed 50, 80, or 100 lb. in a bag--according to the difficulty
of transporting it through the country in which it was to be used. The
best pemmican was made from buffalo meat, and 2 lb. of buffalo pemmican
was considered equal to 2 1/2 lb. of moose or 3 lb. of caribou pemmican.

Later, a cool sunset breeze from over the water blew the little tormentors
away, and then it was that those swarthy men enjoyed their rest.

After supper some made bannock batter in the mouths of flour-sacks,
adding water, salt, and baking powder. This they worked into balls and
spread out in sizzling pans arranged obliquely before the fire with a
bed of coals at the back of each. It was an enlivening scene. Great roaring
fires sent glowing sparks high into the still night air, lighting up the
trees with their intense glare, and casting weird shadows upon the
surrounding tents and bushes. Picturesque, wild-looking men laughed,
talked, and gesticulated at one another.

A few with _capotes_ off were sitting close to the fires, and flipping
into the air the browning flap-jacks that were to be eaten the following
day. Others, with hoods over their heads, lolled back from the fire
smoking their pipes--and by the way, novelists and movie directors and
actors should know that the natives of the northern wilderness, both white
and red, do not smoke cigarettes; they smoke pipes and nothing else. Some
held their moccasins before the fire to dry, or arranged their
blankets for turning in. Others slipped away under cover of darkness to
rub pork rinds on the bottom of their canoes, for there was much rivalry
as to the speed of the crews. Still more beautiful grows the scene,
when the June moon rises above the trees and tips with flickering light
the running waves.

Sauntering from one crew's fire to another, I listened for a while to the
talking and laughing of the voyageurs, but hearing no thrilling tales or
even a humorous story by that noted romancer Old Billy Brass, I went
over and sat down at the officers' fire, where Chief Factor Thompson was
discussing old days and ways with his brother trader.

THE LONGEST BRIGADE ROUTES
After a little while I asked:

"What was the longest route of the old-time canoe and boat brigades?"
"There were several very long ones," replied Mr. Thompson, "for instance,
the one from Montreal to Vancouver, a distance of about three thousand
miles; also the one from York Factory on Hudson Bay to the Queen Charlotte
Islands, and another from York Factory to the Mackenzie River posts. Some
of the portages on the main highway of canoe travel were rather long,
for instance, the one at Portage La Loche was twelve miles in length and
over it everything had to be carried on man back.

"In winter time, travel was by way of snowshoes, dog-sled, or jumper.
A jumper is a low, short, strong sleigh set upon heavy wooden runners
and hauled by ox, horse, men, or dogs.

The freight load per dog--as you know--is a hundred pounds; per man, one
to two hundred pounds; per horse, four to six hundred pounds; and per ox,
five to seven hundred pounds. In summer there were the canoe, York boat,
sturgeon-head scow, and Red River cart brigades. A six-fathom canoe carries
from twenty to thirty packages; a York boat, seventy-five packages; a
Sturgeon-head scow, one hundred packages; and a Red River cart, six
hundred pounds.

The carts were made entirely of wood and leather and were hauled by horse
or ox. With every brigade went the wife of one of the voyageurs to attend
to the mending of the voyageurs' clothing and to look after the comfort of
the officer in charge. But the voyageurs always had to do their own cooking
and washing.

"In the old days, too, much of their food had to be procured from the
country through which they travelled and therefore they relied
upon buffalo, moose, wapiti, deer, bear, beaver, rabbit, fish, and
water-fowl to keep them in plenty."
Then for a while the Factors sat smoking in silence. The moon had mounted
higher and was now out of sight behind the tops of the neighbouring
trees, but its reflection was brilliantly rippled upon the water. At one
of the fires a French half-breed was singing in a rich barytone one
of the old _chansons_ that were so much in vogue among the voyageurs of
by-gone days--_À la Claire Fontaine_. After an encore, silence again held
sway, until around another fire hearty laughter began to play.

"The boys over there must be yarning again," remarked, the Chief Factor,
as he pointed with his pipe, "let's go over, and listen awhile."

BILLY BRASS TELLS ANOTHER STORY
It was Oo-koo-hoo's fire and among his men was seated that ever-welcome
member of another crew--Old Billy Brass. Evidently he had just finished
telling one of his mirth-provoking stories, as the men were good-naturedly
questioning him about it; for, as we sat down, he continued:

"Yes, sir, it's true; fire attraks 'em. Why, I've knowed 'em come from miles
round when they catched a glimpse of it, an' as long as there's danger
o' white bears bein' round you'll never again find Old Billy Brass
tryin' to sleep beside a big fire. No, sir, not even if His Royal
Highness the Commissioner or His Lordship the Bishop gives the word."

Then he sat there slowly drawing upon his pipe with apparently no intention
of adding a single word to what he had already said. Lest something
interesting should be lost, I ventured:

"Was it the Bishop or the Commissioner that made the trouble?"
"No, sir, neither; 'twas the Archdeacon," replied the old man as he
withdrew his pipe and rubbed his smarting eyes clear of the smoke
from the blazing logs.

Taking a few short draws at the tobacco, he continued:

"There was three of us, me an' Archdeacon Lofty an' Captain Hawser, who
was commandin' one of the Company's boats that was a-goin' to winter
in Hudson Bay. It happened in September. The three of us was hoofin' it
along the great barren shore o' the bay.

In some places the shore was that flat that every time the tide came in
she flooded 'bout all the country we could see, an' we had a devil of a
time tryin' to keep clear o' the mud. We had a few dogs along to
help pack our beddin', but, nevertheless, it was hard work; for we
was carryin' most of our outfit on our backs.
"One evenin' just before sundown we stumbled upon a lot o' driftwood
scattered all about the flats. As so much wood was lyin' around
handy, we decided to spend the night on a little knoll that rose
above high-water mark. For the last few days we had seen so little
wood that any of our fires could 'a' been built in a hat. But that
night the sight o' so much wood fairly set the Archdeacon crazy
with delight, an' nothin' would do but we must have a great roarin'
fire to sleep by. I would have enjoyed a good warmin' as well as
any one, but I was mighty leary about havin' a big fire. So I
cautioned the Archdeacon not to use much wood as there was likely
to be bears about, an' that no matter how far off they was, if they
saw that fire they would make for it--even if they was five or six
miles out on the ice floes. He wouldn't listen to me. The Captain
backed him up, an' they both set to an' built a fire as big as a
tepee.
"We was pretty well tuckered out from the day's walkin'. So after
supper we dried our moccasins an' was about to turn in early when--lo
an' behold!--the Archdeacon got up an' piled more wood upon the
fire.
That made me mad; for unless he was huntin' for trouble he couldn't
'a' done a thing more foolish, an' I says somethin' to that effect.
He comes back at me as though I was afraid o' me own shadder, an'
says:
'Billy Brass, I'm s'prised that a man like you doesn't put more
faith in prayin' an' trustin' hisself in the hands o' the Almighty.'

"I was so hot over the foolishness of havin' such a big fire that
I ups an' says:
"'That may be all right for you, sir, but I prefer to use my wits
first, an' trust in Providence afterwards.'
"Nothin' more was said, an' we all turns in. I didn't like the idea
of every one goin' to sleep with a fire so big that it was showin'
itself for miles aroun', so I kep' myself awake. I wasn't exactly
thinkin' that somethin' really serious was goin' to happen, but I
was just wishin' it would, just to teach the Archdeacon a lesson.The "speaking" of the nation is the action of its legislative
and judicial authorities. By such action it will give the lie to those
liberal and peaceful principles which it has put forth as the foundation
of its policy. The prediction that it will speak "as a dragon," and
exercise "all the power of the first beast," plainly foretells a
development of the spirit of intolerance and persecution that was
manifested by the nations represented by the dragon and the leopard-like
beast. And the statement that the beast with two horns "causeth the earth
and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast," indicates that
the authority of this nation is to be exercised in enforcing some
observance which shall be an act of homage to the papacy.

Such action would be directly contrary to the principles of this
government, to the genius of its free institutions, to the direct and
solemn avowals of the Declaration of Independence, and to the
Constitution. The founders of the nation wisely sought to guard against
the employment of secular power on the part of the church, with its
inevitable result--intolerance and persecution. The Constitution provides
that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and that "no religious test
shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust
under the United States." Only in flagrant violation of these safeguards
to the nation's liberty, can any religious observance be enforced by civil
authority. But the inconsistency of such action is no greater than is
represented in the symbol. It is the beast with lamb-like horns--in
profession pure, gentle, and harmless--that speaks as a dragon.

"Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that _they_ should make an image
to the beast." Here is clearly presented a form of government in which the
legislative power rests with the people; a most striking evidence that the
United States is the nation denoted in the prophecy.

But what is the "image to the beast"? and how is it to be formed? The
image is made by the two-horned beast, and is an image _to_ the first
beast. It is also called an image _of_ the beast. Then to learn what the
image is like, and how it is to be formed, we must study the
characteristics of the beast itself,--the papacy.

When the early church became corrupted by departing from the simplicity of
the gospel and accepting heathen rites and customs, she lost the Spirit
and power of God; and in order to control the consciences of the people,
she sought the support of the secular power. The result was the papacy, a
church that controlled the power of the state, and employed it to further
her own ends, especially for the punishment of "heresy." In order for the
United States to form an image of the beast, the religious power must so
control the civil government that the authority of the state will also be
employed by the church to accomplish her own ends.

Whenever the church has obtained secular power, she has employed it to
punish dissent from her doctrines. Protestant churches that have followed
in the steps of Rome by forming alliance with worldly powers, have
manifested a similar desire to restrict liberty of conscience. An example
of this is given in the long-continued persecution of dissenters by the
Church of England. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
thousands of non-conformist ministers were forced to leave their churches,
and many, both of pastors and people, were subjected to fine,
imprisonment, torture, and martyrdom.

It was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the civil
government, and this prepared the way for the development of the
papacy,--the beast. Said Paul, "There" shall "come a falling away, ... and
that man of sin be revealed."(744) So apostasy in the church will prepare
the way for the image to the beast.

The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there will exist a
state of religious declension similar to that in the first centuries. "In
the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be _lovers of their
own selves,_ covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to
parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers,
false accusers, incontinent, fierce, _despisers of those that are good_,
traitors, heady, high-minded, _lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
God; having a form of godliness_, but denying the power thereof."(745)
"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of
devils."(746) Satan will work "with all power and signs and lying wonders,
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness." And all that "received
not the love of the truth, that they might be saved," will be left to
accept "strong delusion, that they should believe a lie."(747) When this
state of ungodliness shall be reached, the same results will follow as in
the first centuries.

The wide diversity of belief in the Protestant churches is regarded by
many as decisive proof that no effort to secure a forced uniformity can
ever be made. But there has been for years, in churches of the Protestant
faith, a strong and growing sentiment in favor of a union based upon
common points of doctrine. To secure such a union, the discussion of
subjects upon which all were not agreed--however important they might be
from a Bible standpoint--must necessarily be waived.

The juice of bearberries gives them a bright red. From gunpowder and water
they obtain a fine black, and from coal tar a stain for work of the coarsest
kind. They rely chiefly, however, upon the red, blue, green, and yellow
ochres found in many parts of the country. These, when applied to
the decoration of canoes, they mix with fish oil; but for general purposes
the earths are baked and used in the form of powder.

From scenes such as I have described the summer traveller obtains
his impression of the forest Indians. Too often their life and
character are judged by such scenes, as if these truly represented their
whole existence.

In reality, this is but their holiday season which they are spending upon
their tribal summer camping ground. It is only upon their hunting grounds
that one may fairly study the Indians; so, presently, we shall follow
them there. And when one experiences the wild, free life the Indian
lives--hampered by no household goods or other property that he
cannot at a moment's notice dump into his canoe and carry with him
to the ends of the earth if he chooses--one not only envies him,
but ceases to wonder which of the two is the greater philosopher--the
white man or the red; for the poor old white man is so overwhelmed
with absurd conventions and encumbering property that he can rarely
do what his heart dictates.

FAMILY HUNTING GROUNDS
Don't let us decide just yet, however, whether the Indian derives more
pleasure from life than does the white man, at least, not until we return
from our voyage of pleasure and investigation; but before we leave Fort
Consolation it is well to know that the hunting grounds in possession
of the Indian tribes that live in the Great Northern Forest have been for
centuries divided and subdivided and allotted, either by bargain or
by battle, to the main families of each band. In many cases the same
hunting grounds have remained in the undisputed possession of the same
families for generations. Family hunting grounds are usually delimited
by natural boundaries, such as hills, valleys, rivers, and lakes. The
allotments of land generally take the form of wedge-shaped tracts radiating
from common centres.

From the intersection of these converging boundary lines the common
centres become the hubs of the various districts. These district centres
mark convenient summer camping grounds for the reunion of families
after their arduous labour during the long winter hunting season. The
tribal summer camping grounds, therefore, are not only situated on the
natural highways of the country--the principal rivers and lakes--but also
indicate excellent fishing stations.

There, too, the Indians have their burial grounds.

Often these camping grounds are the summer headquarters for from three
to eight main families; and each main family may contain from five or
six to fifty or sixty hunting men. Inter-marriage between families of two
districts gives the man the right to hunt on the land of his wife's
family as long as he "sits on the brush" with her--is wedded to her--but
the children do not inherit that right; it dies with the father. An Indian
usually lives upon his own land, but makes frequent excursions to
the land of his wife's family.

In the past, the side boundaries of hunting grounds have been the cause of
many family feuds, and the outer boundaries have furnished the occasion
for many tribal wars. The past and the present headquarters camping
grounds of the Strong Woods Indians--as the inhabitants of the Great
Northern Forest are generally called--lie about one hundred and fifty miles
apart.

The natural overland highways throughout the country, especially those
intersecting the watercourses and now used as the roadbeds for our great
transcontinental railways, were not originally discovered by man at all.
The credit is due to the big game of the wilderness; for the animals
were not only the first to find them, but also the first to use them.

The Indian simply followed the animals, and the trader followed the
Indian, and the official "explorer" followed the trader, and the engineer
followed the "explorer," and the railroad contractor followed the engineer.
It was the buffalo, the deer, the bear, and the wolf who were our
original transcontinental path-finders, or rather pathmakers.
Then, too, the praise bestowed upon the pioneer fur traders for the excellent
judgment shown in choosing the sites upon which trading posts
have been established throughout Canada, has not been deserved; the
credit is really due to the Indians. The fur traders erected their posts
or forts upon the tribal camping grounds simply because they found such
spots to be the general meeting places of the Indians, and not only
situated on the principal highways of the wilderness but accessible
from all points of the surrounding country, and, moreover, the very
centres of excellent fish and game regions.

Thus in Canada many of the ancient tribal camping grounds are now
known by the names of trading posts, of progressive frontier towns, or of
important cities.

Now, as of old, the forest Indians after their winter's hunt return in the
early summer to trade their catch of furs, to meet old friends,
and to rest and gossip awhile before the turning leaf warns them to secure
their next winter's "advances" from the trader, and once more paddle away
to their distant hunting grounds.

The several zones of the Canadian wilderness are locally known as the
Coast Country--the shores of the Arctic Ocean and Hudson Bay; the
Barren Grounds--the treeless country between Hudson Bay and the Mackenzie
River; the Strong Woods Country--the whole of that enormous belt of
heavy timber that spans Canada from east to west; the Border Lands--the
tracts of small, scattered timber that lie between the prairies
and the northern forests; the Prairie Country; the Mountains; and
the Big Lakes.

These names have been adopted by the fur traders from the Indians. It is
in the Strong Woods Country that most of the fur-bearing animals

MEETING OO-KOO-HOO
About ten o'clock on the morning after our arrival at Fort Consolation,
Free Trader Spear left for home with my promise to paddle over and dine
at Spearhead next day.

At noon Factor Mackenzie informed me that he had received word that
Oo-koo-hoo--The Owl--was coming to the Fort that afternoon and that, taking
everything into consideration, he thought Oo-koo-hoo's hunting party the
best for me to join.

It consisted, he said, of Oo-koo-hoo and his wife, his daughter, and his
son-in-law, Amik--The Beaver--and Amik's five children. The Factor further
added that Oo-koo-hoo was not only one of the greatest hunters, and one
of the best canoe-men in that district, but in his youth he had been
a great traveller, as he had hunted with other Indian tribes, on Hudson
Bay, on the Churchill, the Peace, the Athabasca, and the Slave
rivers, and even on the far-away Mackenzie; and was a master at the
game.

His son-in-law, Amik, was his hunting partner. Though Amik would not be home
until to-morrow, Oo-koo-hoo and his wife, their daughter and her children
were coming that afternoon to get their "advances," as the party contemplated
leaving for their hunting grounds on the second day. That I might look
them over while they were getting their supplies in the Indian shop, and
if I took a fancy to the old gentleman--who by the way was about
sixty years of age--the trader would give me an introduction, and I
could then make my arrangements with the hunter himself. So after dinner,
when word came that they had landed, I left the living room for the Indian
shop.

In the old days, in certain parts of the country, when the Indians
came to the posts to get their "advances" or to barter their winter's catch
of fur, the traders had to exercise constant caution to prevent them from
looting the establishments. At some of the posts only a few Indians
at a time were allowed within the fort, and even then trading was
done through a wicket. But that applied only to the Plains Indians and
to some of the natives of the Pacific Coast; for the Strong Woods
people were remarkably honest. Even to-day this holds good notwithstanding
the fact that they are now so much in contact with white men. Nowadays the
Indians in any locality rarely cause trouble, and at the trading
posts the business of the Indian shops is conducted in a quiet and
orderly way.

The traders do most of their bartering with the Indians in the early summer
when the hunters return laden with the spoils of their winter's hunt.
In the early autumn, when the Indians are about to leave for their hunting
grounds, much business is done, but little in the way of barter. At that
season the Indians procure their outfit for the winter. Being usually
insolvent, owing to the leisurely time spent upon the tribal camping
grounds, they receive the necessary supplies on credit. The amount of
credit, or "advances," given to each Indian seldom exceeds one third of the
value of his average annual catch.
That is the white man's way of securing, in advance, the bulk of the
Indian's prospective hunt; yet, although a few of them are sometimes
slow in settling their debts, they are never a match for the civilized
white man.

When I entered the trading room I saw that it was furnished with a
U-shaped counter paralleling three sides of the room, and with a large
box-stove in the middle of the intervening space. On the shelves and racks
upon the walls and from hooks in the rafters rested or hung a
conglomeration of goods to be offered in trade to the natives.

There were copper pails and calico dresses, pain-killer bottles and Hudson's
Bay blankets, sow-belly and chocolate drops, castor oil and gun worms,
frying-pans and ladies' wire bustles, guns and corsets, axes and
ribbons, shirts and hunting-knives, perfumes and bear traps. In a way,
the Indian shop resembled a department store except that all the departments
were jumbled together in a single room. At one post I visited years
ago--that of Abitibi--they had a rather progressive addition in the
way of a millinery department. It was contained in a large lidless packing
case against the side of which stood a long steering paddle for the clerk's
use in stirring about the varied assortment of white women's ancient
headgear, should a fastidious Indian woman request to see more than the
uppermost layer.

Already a number of Indians were being served by the Factor and Delaronde,
the clerk, and I had not long to wait before Oo-koo-hoo appeared. I surmised
at once who he was, for one could see by the merest glance at his
remarkably pleasant yet thoroughly clever face, that he was all his name
implied, a wise, dignified old gentleman, who was in the habit of observing
much more than he gave tongue to--a rare quality in men--especially white
men. Even before I heard him speak I liked Oo-koo-hoo--The Owl.

                     See Chapter I]

But before going any farther, I ought to explain that as I am endeavouring
to render a faithful description of forest life, I am going to repeat in
the next few paragraphs part of what once appeared in one of my
fictitious stories of northern life. I then made use of the matter
because it was the truth, and for that very reason I am now going to repeat
it; also because this transaction as depicted is typical of what
usually happens when the Indians try to secure their advances. Furthermore,
I give the dialogue in detail, as perchance some reader may feel as Thoreau
did, when he said: "It would be some advantage to live a primitive and
frontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if
only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods
have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over the old day-books
of the merchants, to see what it was that men most commonly bought
at the stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest
groceries."

But while the following outfit might be considered the Indian's grossest
groceries, the articles are not really necessaries at all for him; for, to
go to the extreme, a good woodsman can hunt without even gun,
axe, knife, or matches, and can live happily, absolutely independent
of our civilization.

As the Factor was busy with another Indian when the Chief entered--for
Oo-koo-hoo was the chief of the Ojibways of that district--he
waited patiently, as he would not deign to do business with a clerk.

When he saw the trader free, he greeted:

"_Quay, quay, Hugemow_!" (Good day, Master).

"Gude day, man Oo-koo-hoo, what can I do for ye the day?" amicably responded
the Factor.

"Master, it is this way. I am about to leave for my hunting grounds;
but this time I am going to spend the winter upon a new part of them, where
I have not hunted for years, and where game of all kinds will be
plentiful.

Therefore, I want you to give me liberal advances so that my hunt
will not be hindered."
"Pegs, Oo-koo-hoo, ma freen', yon's an auld, auld farrant. But ye're well
kenn'd for a leal, honest man; an' sae, I'se no be unco haird upon ye."

So saying, the Factor made him a present of a couple of pounds of flour,
half a pound of pork, half a pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of tea,
a plug of tobacco, and some matches. The Factor's generosity was
prompted largely by his desire to keep the Indian in good
humour. After a little friendly chaffing, the Factor promised to give the
hunter advances to the extent of one hundred "skins."
A "skin," or, as it is often called, a "made beaver," is equivalent to
one dollar in the Hudson Bay and the Mackenzie River districts, but only
fifty cents in the region of the Athabasca.

Perhaps it should be explained here that while Oo-koo-hoo could speak
broken English, he always preferred to use his own language when
addressing the trader, whom he knew to be quite conversant with Ojibway,
and so, throughout this book, I have chosen to render the Indian's speech
as though it was translated from Ojibway into English, rather than at any
time render it in broken English, as the former is not only easier
to read, but is more expressive of the natural quality of the Indian's
speech. In olden days some of the chiefs who could not speak English
at all were, it is claimed, eloquent orators--far outclassing our greatest
statesmen.

Oo-koo-hoo, having ascertained the amount of his credit, reckoned
that he would use about fifty skins in buying traps and ammunition;
the rest he would devote to the purchase of necessaries for himself
and his party, as his son-in-law had arranged with him to look after
his family's wants in his absence.

So the old gentleman now asked for the promised skins. He was handed one
hundred marked goose quills representing that number of skins. After
checking them over in bunches of ten, he entrusted twenty to his eldest
grandson, Ne-geek--The Otter--to be held in reserve for ammunition and
tobacco, and ten to his eldest granddaughter, Neykia, with which to
purchase an outfit for the rest of the party.

For a long time Oo-koo-hoo stood immersed in thought.

At last his face brightened. He had reached a decision. For years
he had coveted a new muzzle-loading gun, and he felt that the time had now
arrived to get it. So he picked out one valued at forty skins and paid for
it. Then, taking back the quills his grandson held, he bought twenty skins'
worth of powder, caps, shot, and bullets. Then he selected for himself
a couple of pairs of trousers, one pair made of moleskin and the other
of tweed, costing ten skins; two shirts and a suit of underwear, ten
skins; half a dozen assorted traps, ten skins. Finding that he had used
up all his quills, he drew on those set aside for his wife and
son-in-law's family and bought tobacco, five skins; files, one skin;
an axe, two skins; a knife, one skin; matches, one half skin; and
candy for his youngest grandchild, one half skin.

On looking over his acquisitions he discovered that he must have at
least ten skins' worth of twine for nets and snares, five skins' worth of
tea, one skin worth of soap, one skin worth of needles and thread, as well
as a tin pail and a new frying pan. After a good deal of haggling, the
Factor threw him that number of quills, and Oo-koo-hoo's manifest
contentment somewhat relieved the trader's anxiety.

A moment later, however, Oo-koo-hoo was reminded by his wife, Ojistoh, that
there was nothing for her, so she determined to interview the Factor herself.
She tried to persuade him to give her twenty skins in trade, and promised
to pay for them in the spring with rat and ermine skins, or--should those
fail her--with her dog, which was worth fully thirty skins. She had been
counting on getting some cotton print for a dress, as well as thread and
needles, to say nothing of extra tea, which in all would amount to at least
thirty-five or forty skins.
When, however, the Factor allowed her only ten skins, her disappointment
was keen, and she ended by getting a shawl.

Then she left the trading room to pay a visit to the Factor's wife,
and confide to her the story of her expectations and of her
disappointment so movingly that she would get a cup of tea, a word of
sympathy, and perhaps even an old petticoat.

In the meantime, Oo-koo-hoo was catching it again. He had forgotten
his daughter; so after more haggling the trader agreed to advance
her ten skins. Her mind had long been made up. She bought a three-point
blanket, a small head shawl, and a piece of cotton print. Then
the grandsons crowded round and grumbled because there was nothing for
them.

By this time the trader was beginning to feel that he had done pretty
well for the family already; but he kept up the appearance of bluff
good humour, and asked:
"Well, Oo-koo-hoo, what wad ye be wantin' for the laddies?"

"My grandsons are no bunglers, as you know," said the proud old grandsire.
"They can each kill at least twenty skins' worth of fur."
"Aye, aye!" rejoined the trader. "I shall e'en gi'e them twenty atween
them."
In the goodness of his heart he offered the boys some advice as to what
they should buy: "Ye'll be wantin' to buy traps, I'm jalousin', an' sure
ye'll turn oot to be graun' hunters, Nimrods o' the North that
men'll mak' sangs aboot i' the comin' years." He cautioned them to choose
wisely, because from henceforth they would be personally responsible for
everything they bought, and must pay, "skin for skin" (the motto
of the Hudson's Bay Company).

The boys listened with gloomy civility, and then purchased an assortment
of useless trifles such as ribbons, tobacco, buttons, candy, rings,
pomatum, perfume, and Jew's harps.

The Factor's patience was now nearly exhausted. He picked up his
account book, and strode to the door, and held it open as a hint to the
Indians to leave. But they pretended to take no notice of his action.

The granddaughters, who had been growing more and more anxious lest they
should be forgotten, now began to be voluble in complaint.
Oo-koo-hoo called the trader aside and explained the trouble. The Factor
realized that he was in a corner, and that if he now refused further
supplies he would offend the old chief and drive him to sell his
best furs to the opposition trader in revenge.

He surrendered, and the girls received ten skins between them.

At long last everyone was pleased except the unhappy Factor. Gathering his
purchases together, Oo-koo-hoo tied up the powder, shot, tea, and sugar
in the legs of the trousers; placed the purchases for his wife,
daughter, and granddaughters in the shawl, and the rest of the goods
in the blanket.

Then he made the discovery that he had neither flour nor grease. He could
not start without them. The Factor's blood was now almost at the boiling
pitch, but he dared not betray his feelings; for the Indian was ready to
take offence at the slightest word, so rich and independent did he feel.
Angering him now would simply mean adding to the harvest of the
opposition trader. He chewed his lower lip in the effort to smother
his disgust, and growled out with an angry grin:
"Hoots, mon, ye ha'e gotten ower muckle already. It's fair redeeklus.
I jist canna gi'e ye onythin' mair ava!"
"Ah, but, master, you have forgotten that I am a great hunter. And
that my son-in-law is a great hunter, too. This is but the outfit
for a lazy man!The reason why He does not oftener choose men of learning
and high position to lead out in reform movements, is that they trust to
their creeds, theories, and theological systems, and feel no need to be
taught of God. Only those who have a personal connection with the Source
of wisdom are able to understand or explain the Scriptures. Men who have
little of the learning of the schools are sometimes called to declare the
truth, not because they are unlearned, but because they are not too
self-sufficient to be taught of God. They learn in the school of Christ,
and their humility and obedience make them great. In committing to them a
knowledge of His truth, God confers upon them an honor, in comparison with
which earthly honor and human greatness sink into insignificance.

The majority of Adventists rejected the truths concerning the sanctuary
and the law of God, and many also renounced their faith in the Advent
Movement, and adopted unsound and conflicting views of the prophecies
which applied to that work. Some were led into the error of repeatedly
fixing upon a definite time for the coming of Christ. The light which was
now shining on the subject of the sanctuary would have shown them that no
prophetic period extends to the second advent; that the exact time of this
event is not foretold. But, turning from the light, they continued to set
time after time for the Lord to come, and as often they were disappointed.

When the Thessalonian church received erroneous views concerning the
coming of Christ, the apostle Paul counseled them to test their hopes and
anticipations carefully by the word of God. He cited them to prophecies
revealing the events to take place before Christ should come, and showed
that they had no ground to expect Him in their day. "Let no man deceive
you by any means,"(768) are his words of warning. Should they indulge
expectations that were not sanctioned by the Scriptures, they would be led
to a mistaken course of action; disappointment would expose them to the
derision of unbelievers, and they would be in danger of yielding to
discouragement, and would be tempted to doubt the truths essential for
their salvation. The apostle's admonition to the Thessalonians contains an
important lesson for those who live in the last days. Many Adventists have
felt that unless they could fix their faith upon a definite time for the
Lord's coming, they could not be zealous and diligent in the work of
preparation. But as their hopes are again and again excited, only to be
destroyed, their faith receives such a shock that it becomes well-nigh
impossible for them to be impressed by the great truths of prophecy.

The preaching of a definite time for the judgment, in the giving of the
first message, was ordered of God. The computation of the prophetic
periods on which that message was based, placing the close of the 2300
days in the autumn of 1844, stands without impeachment. The repeated
efforts to find new dates for the beginning and close of the prophetic
periods, and the unsound reasoning necessary to sustain these positions,
not only lead minds away from the present truth, but throw contempt upon
all efforts to explain the prophecies. The more frequently a definite time
is set for the second advent, and the more widely it is taught, the better
it suits the purposes of Satan. After the time has passed, he excites
ridicule and contempt of its advocates, and thus casts reproach upon the
great Advent Movement of 1843 and 1844. Those who persist in this error
will at last fix upon a date too far in the future for the coming of
Christ. Thus they will be led to rest in a false security, and many will
not be undeceived until it is too late.

The history of ancient Israel is a striking illustration of the past
experience of the Adventist body. God led His people in the Advent
Movement, even as He led the children of Israel from Egypt. In the great
disappointment their faith was tested as was that of the Hebrews at the
Red Sea. Had they still trusted to the guiding hand that had been with
them in their past experience, they would have seen of the salvation of
God. If all who had labored unitedly in the work in 1844, had received the
third angel's message and proclaimed it in the power of the Holy Spirit,
the Lord would have wrought mightily with their efforts. A flood of light
would have been shed upon the world. There is a certain Dingo that does
not seem to love you. What have you done to that animal?"
"Nothing," replied Negoro; "but before long it will receive a ball
in the head."

"As you would have received one from Dick Sand, if you had shown ever so
little of your person within two hundred feet of his gun. Ah! how well
he fires, my young friend; and, between you and me, I am obliged to admit
that he is, in his way, a fine boy."
"No matter how fine he is, Harris, he will pay dear for his insolence,"
replied Negoro, whose countenance expressed implacable cruelty.

"Good," murmured Harris, "my comrade remains just the same as I have
always known him! Voyages have not injured him!"
Then, after a moment's silence: "Ah, there, Negoro," continued he, "when I
met you so fortunately there below, at the scene of the shipwreck, at the
mouth of the Longa, you only had time to recommend those honest
people to me, while begging me to lead them as far as possible
across this pretended Bolivia.

You have not told me what you have been doing these two years! Two years,
comrade, in our chance existence, is a long time. One fine day, after
having taken charge of a caravan of slaves on old Alvez's account--whose
very humble agents we are--you left Cassange, and have not been heard of
since! I have thought that you had some disagreement with the English
cruiser, and that you were hung!"
"I came very near it, Harris."
"That will come, Negoro."
"Thank you!"
"What would you have?" replied Harris, with an indifference quite
philosophical; "it is one of the chances of the trade! We do not carry on
the slave-trade on the coast of Africa without running the risk of
dying elsewhere than in our beds! So, you have been taken?"
"Yes!"
"By the English?"
"No! By the Portuguese."
"Before or after having delivered your cargo?"

asked Harris.

"After--," replied Negoro, who had hesitated a little about replying.
"These Portuguese now make difficulties. They want no more slavery,
though they have used it so long to their profit. I was denounced
--watched. They took me--"
"And condemned--"
"Me to finish my days in the penitentiary of St. Paul de Loanda."
"A thousand devils!" exclaimed Harris. "That is an unhealthy place for
men accustomed, like us, to live in the open air. As to me, perhaps I
should prefer being hung."
"One does not escape from the gallows," replied Negoro; "but from
prison--" 
"You were able to make your escape?"

"Yes, Harris. Only fifteen days after being put in prison. I was able to
hide myself at the bottom of the hold of an English steamer, sailing
for Auckland, of New Zealand. A barrel of water and a case of conserves,
between which I had intruded, furnished me with food and drink during
the whole passage. Oh! I suffered terribly, from not being willing to show
myself when we were at sea.

But, if I had been imprudent enough to do it, I would have been confined
again at the bottom of the hold, and, voluntarily or not, the torture
would be the same. Besides, on my arrival at Auckland, they would have
returned me again to the English authorities, and finally brought me back
to the penitentiary of Loanda, or, perhaps, hung me, as you said. That
was why I preferred to travel incognito."
"And without paying your passage!" exclaimed Harris, laughing. "Ah!
that is not considerate, comrade, to be fed and carried gratis!"
"Yes," returned Negoro, "but thirty days' passage at the bottom of the
hold--"

"At last that was over, Negoro. You set out for New Zealand, in the
land of the Maoris. But you have returned. Was the return made under the
same circumstances?"
"Not so, Harris. You may well believe that, over there, I had only one
idea--to return to Angola and take up my trade of slave-trader again."

"Yes," replied Harris, "one loves his trade--from habit."
"For eighteen months--"
Having pronounced those last words, Negoro stopped suddenly. He seized
his companion's arm, and listened.

"Harris," said he, lowering his voice, "was there not a trembling in that
papyrus bush?"
"Yes, indeed," replied Harris, seizing his gun, always ready to fire.

Negoro and he stood up, looked around them, and listened with the greatest
attention.

"There is nothing there," said Harris. "It is this brook, swelled by the
storm, which runs more noisily. For two years, comrade, you have been
unaccustomed to the noises of the forest, but you will get used to them
again. Continue, then, the narration of your adventures.

When I understand the past, we shall talk of the future."

                     Negoro and Harris sat down again at the foot of the banyan.

The Portuguese continued, in these terms:

"For eighteen months I vegetated in Auckland. When the steamer arrived
there I was able to leave it without being seen; but not a piastre,
not a dollar in my pocket! In order to live I had to follow all trades--"

"Even the trade of an honest man, Negoro?"
"As you say, Harris."
"Poor boy!"
"Now, I was always waiting for an opportunity, which was long coming, when
the 'Pilgrim,' a whaler, arrived at the port of Auckland."
"That vessel which went ashore on the coast of Angola?"
"Even the same, Harris, and on which Mrs. Weldon, her child, and her cousin
were going to take passage. Now, as an old sailor, having even been
second on board a slave ship, I was not out of my element in taking
service on a ship. I then presented myself to the 'Pilgrim's' captain, but
the crew was made up.

Very fortunately for me, the schooner's cook had deserted. Now, he is
no sailor who does not know how to cook. I offered myself as head cook.
For want of a better, I was accepted. A few days after, the 'Pilgrim' had
lost sight of the land of New Zealand."
"But," asked Harris, "according to what my young friend has told me, the
'Pilgrim' did not set sail at all for the coast of Africa. How then has
she arrived here?"
"Dick Sand ought not to be able to understand it yet, and perhaps he will
never understand it," replied Negoro; "but I am going to explain to you
what has passed, Harris, and you will be able to tell it again to your
young friend, if it pleases you to do so."
"How, then?" replied Harris. "Speak, comrade, speak!"
"The 'Pilgrim,'" continued Negoro, "as on the way to Valparaiso. When I went
on board, I only intended to go to Chili.

It was always a good half of the way between New Zealand and
Angola, and I was drawing nearer Africa's coast by several thousand
miles. But it so happened that only three weeks after leaving Auckland,
Captain Hull, who commanded the 'Pilgrim,' disappeared with all his
crew, while chasing a whale. On that day, then, only two sailors remained
on board--the novice and the cook, Negoro."
"And you took command of the ship?" asked Harris.

"I had that idea at first, but I saw that they distrusted me. There were
live strong blacks on board, free men.

I would not have been the master, and, on reflection, I remained what I
was at the departure--the 'Pilgrim's' cook."
"Then it was chance that led this ship to the coast of Africa?"
"No, Harris," replied Negoro; "there has been no chance in all this adventure
except meeting you, in one of your journeys, just on that part of the
coast where the 'Pilgrim' was wrecked. But as to coming in sight of Angola,
it was by my will, my secret will, that that was done.

Your young friend, still much of a novice in navigation, could only tell
his position by means of the log and the compass. Well, one day, the
log went to the bottom. One night the compass was made false, and the
'Pilgrim,' driven by a violent tempest, took the wrong route.
The length of the voyage, inexplicable to Dick Sand, would be the same to
the most experienced seaman. Without the novice knowing or even suspecting
it, Cape Horn was doubled, but I, Harris, I recognized it in the
midst of the fogs.

Then, thanks to me, the needle in the compass took its true direction again,
and the ship, blown to the northeast by that frightful hurricane, has just
been cast on the coast of Africa, just on this land of Angola which
I wished to reach."
"And even at that moment, Negoro," replied Harris, "chance had led me there
to receive you, and guide those honest people to the interior.
They believed themselves--they could only believe themselves in America.
It was easy for me to make them take this province for lower
Bolivia, to which it has really some resemblance."

"Yes, they believed it, as your young friend believed they had made the
Isle of Paques, when they passed in sight of Tristan d'Acunha."

"Anybody would be deceived by it, Negoro."
"I know it, Harris, and I even counted on profiting by that error.
Finally, behold Mrs. Weldon and her companions one hundred miles in the
interior of this Africa, where I wanted to bring them!"

"But," replied Harris, "they know now where they are."
"Ah! what matter at present!" cried Negoro.

"And what will you do with them?" asked Harris.

"What will I do with them?" replied Negoro. "Before telling you, Harris,
give me news of our master, the slave-trader, Alvez, whom I have not
seen for two years."
"Oh, the old rascal is remarkably well," replied Harris, "and he will be
enchanted to see you again."
"Is he at the Bihe market?" asked Negoro.

"No, comrade, he has been at his establishment at Kazounde for a year."

"And business is lively?"
"Yes, a thousand devils!" exclaimed Harris, "although the slave trade
becomes more and more difficult, at least on this coast. The Portuguese
authorities on one side, and the English cruisers on the other, limit
exportations. There are few places, except in the environs of Mossamedes,
to the south of Angola, that the shipping of blacks can now be made
with any chance of success. So, at this time, the pens are filled
with slaves, waiting for the ships which ought to carry them to Spanish
colonies. As to passing them by Benguela, or St. Paul de Loanda, that is
not possible. The governors no longer understand reason, no more do the
chiefs (title given to the Portuguese governors of secondary establishments).
We must, then, return to the factories of the interior. This is what old
Alvez intends to do. He will go from the Nyangwe and Tanganyika side to
change his stuffs for ivory and slaves. Business is always profitable
with upper Egypt and the Mozambique coast, which furnishes all Madagascar.
But I fear the time will come when the trade can be no longer
carried on.

The English are making great progress in the interior of Africa. The
missionaries advance and work against us. That Livingstone, curse him,
after exploring the lake region, is going, they say, to travel toward
Angola. Then they speak of a Lieutenant Cameron, who proposes to cross
the continent from east to west. They also fear that the American, Stanley,
wishes to do as much. All these visits will end by damaging our
operations, Negoro, and if we care for our own interests, not one of those
visitors will return to relate in Europe what he has had the indiscretion
to come to see in Africa."
Would not one say, to hear them, the rascals, that they were speaking like
honest merchants whose affairs were momentarily cramped by a commercial
crisis?

Who would believe that, instead of sacks of coffee or casks of sugar, they
were talking of human beings to export like merchandise? These traders
have no other idea of right or wrong. The moral sense is entirely lacking
in them, and if they had any, how quickly they would lose it among the
frightful atrocities of the African slave trade.

But where Harris was right, was when he said that civilization was
gradually penetrating those savage countries in the wake of those hardy
travelers, whose names are indissoluble linked to the discoveries of
Equatorial Africa.

At the head, David Livingstone, after him, Grant, Speke, Burton, Cameron,
Stanley, those heroes will leave imperishable names as benefactors of
humanity.

When their conversation reached that point, Harris knew what the last
two years of Negoro's life had been. The trader Alvez's old agent, the
escaped prisoner from the Loanda penitentiary, reappeared the same as Harris
had always known him, that is, ready to do anything. But what plan Negoro
intended to take in regard to the shipwrecked from the "Pilgrim," Harris
did not yet know. He asked his accomplice about it.

"And now," said he, "what are you going to do with those people?"
"I shall make two parties of them," replied Negoro, like a man whose plan
had been long formed, "those whom I shall sell as slaves, and those
whom----"
The Portuguese did not finish, but his ferocious physiognomy spoke
plainly enough.

"Which will you sell?" asked Harris.

"Those blacks who accompany Mrs. Weldon," replied Negoro. "Old Tom is
not perhaps of much value, but the others are four strong fellows, who will
bring a high price in the Kazounde market."
"I well believe it, Negoro," replied Harris. "Four negroes, well made,
accustomed to work, have very little resemblance to those brutes which come
to us from the interior. Certainly, you will sell them at a high price.
Slaves, born in America, and exported to the markets of Angola; that
is rare merchandise! But," added the American, "you have not told me if
there was any money on board the 'Pilgrim.'"

"Oh! a few hundred dollars only, which I have succeeded in saving.
Fortunately, I count on certain returns."
"Which, then, comrade?" asked Harris, with curiosity.

"Nothing!" replied Negoro, who appeared to regret having spoken more
than he intended.

"It now remains to take possession of all that high-priced merchandise,"
said Harris.

"Is it, then, so difficult?" asked Negoro.

"No, comrade. Ten miles from here, on the Coanza, a caravan of slaves is
encamped, conducted by the Arab, Ibn Hamis. He only awaits my return to
take the road for Kazounde. There are more native soldiers there
than are needed to capture Dick Sand and his companions. It will
be sufficient for my young friend to conceive the idea of going to the
Coanza."
"But will he get that idea?" asked Negoro.

"Surely," replied Harris, "because he is intelligent, and cannot
suspect the danger that awaits him. Dick Sand would not think of
returning to the coast by the way we have followed together. He
would be lost among these immense forests. He will seek, then, I
am sure, to reach one of the rivers that flow toward the coast, so
as to descend it on a raft. He has no other plan to take, and I
know he will take it."
"Yes, perhaps so," replied Negoro, who was reflecting.
"It is not 'perhaps so,' it is 'assuredly so,' that must be said,"
continued Harris. "Do you see, Negoro? It is as if I had appointed
a rendezvous with my young friend on the banks of the Coanza."

"Well, then," replied Negoro, "let us go. I know Dick Sand. He will
not delay an hour, and we must get before him."
"Let us start, comrade."
Harris and Negoro both stood up, when the noise that had before
attracted the Portuguese's attention was renewed. It was a trembling
of the stems between the high papyrus.
Negoro stopped, and seized Harris's hand.
Suddenly a low barking was heard. A dog appeared at the foot of the
bank, with its mouth open, ready to spring.
"Dingo!" cried Harris.
"Ah! this time it shall not escape me!" replied Negoro.
Dingo was going to jump upon him, when Negoro, seizing Harris's
gun, quickly put it to his shoulder and fired.
A long howl of pain replied to the detonation, and Dingo disappeared
between the double row of bushes that bordered the brook.
Negoro descended at once to the bottom of the bank.
Drops of blood stained some of the papyrus stems, and a long red
track was left on the pebbles of the brook.
"At last that cursed animal is paid off!" exclaimed Negoro.
Harris had been present at this whole scene without saying a
word.
"Ah now, Negoro," said he, "that dog had a particular grudge against
you."
"It seemed so, Harris, but it will have a grudge against me no
longer!" 
"And why did it detest you so much, comrade?"
"Oh! an old affair to settle between it and me."
"An old affair?" replied Harris.
Negoro said no more about it, and Harris concluded that the Portuguese
had been silent on some past adventure, but he did not insist on
knowing it.
A few moments later, both, descending the course of the brook, went
toward the Coanza, across the forest.

CHAPTER III.
ON THE MARCH.It is a revelation
of the will and the character of its Author. God is love, and His law is
love. Its two great principles are love to God and love to man. "Love is
the fulfilling of the law."(785) The character of God is righteousness and
truth; such is the nature of His law. Says the psalmist, "Thy law is the
truth;" "all Thy commandments are righteousness."(786) And the apostle
Paul declares, "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and
good."(787) Such a law, being an expression of the mind and will of God,
must be as enduring as its Author.

It is the work of conversion and sanctification to reconcile men to God,
by bringing them into accord with the principles of His law. In the
beginning, man was created in the image of God. He was in perfect harmony
with the nature and the law of God; the principles of righteousness were
written upon his heart. But sin alienated him from his Maker. He no longer
reflected the divine image. His heart was at war with the principles of
God's law. "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject
to the law of God, neither indeed can be."(788) But "God so loved the
world, that He gave His only begotten Son," that man might be reconciled
to God. Through the merits of Christ he can be restored to harmony with
his Maker. His heart must be renewed by divine grace; he must have a new
life from above. This change is the new birth, without which, says Jesus,
"he cannot see the kingdom of God."

The first step in reconciliation to God, is the conviction of sin. "Sin is
the transgression of the law." "By the law is the knowledge of sin."(789)
In order to see his guilt, the sinner must test his character by God's
great standard of righteousness. It is a mirror which shows the perfection
of a righteous character, and enables him to discern the defects in his
own.

The law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy. While it
promises life to the obedient, it declares that death is the portion of
the transgressor. The gospel of Christ alone can free him from the
condemnation or the defilement of sin. He must exercise repentance toward
God, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in Christ, his atoning
sacrifice. Thus he obtains "remission of sins that are past," and becomes
a partaker of the divine nature. He is a child of God, having received the
spirit of adoption, whereby he cries, "Abba, Father!"

Is he now free to transgress God's law? Says Paul: "Do we then make void
the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." "How shall
we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" And John declares,
"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His
commandments are not grievous."(790) In the new birth the heart is brought
into harmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When
this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death
unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to
obedience and loyalty. The old life of alienation from God has ended; the
new life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then "the
righteousness of the law" will "be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit."(791) And the language of the soul will be,
"O how love I Thy law! it is my meditation all the day."(792)

"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul."(793) Without the
law, men have no just conception of the purity and holiness of God, or of
their own guilt and uncleanness. They have no true conviction of sin, and
feel no need of repentance. Not seeing their lost condition as violators
of God's law, they do not realize their need of the atoning blood of
Christ. The hope of salvation is accepted without a radical change of
heart or reformation of life. Thus superficial conversions abound, and
multitudes are joined to the church who have never been united to Christ.

Erroneous theories of sanctification, also, springing from neglect or
rejection of the divine law, have a prominent place in the religious
movements of the day. These theories are both false in doctrine and
dangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are so generally
finding favor, renders it doubly essential that all have a clear
understanding of what the Scriptures teach upon this point.

True sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter
to the Thessalonian church, declares, "This is the will of God, even your
sanctification." And he prays, "The very God of peace sanctify you
wholly."(794) The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is, and how it
is to be attained. The Saviour prayed for His disciples, "Sanctify them
through Thy truth: Thy word is truth."(795) And Paul teaches that
believers are to be "sanctified by the Holy Ghost."(796) What is the work
of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples, "When He, the Spirit of
truth, is come, He will guide you into all truthThat pleased Lawson.
Presently the Indian threw down a bear skin, saying:

"My brother, this is to see how you look at me."
Now the way of the experienced fur-runner is to offer a big price--often an
excessive price--for the first skin. He calculates that it puts the
Indian in a good humour and in the end gives the trader a chance of
getting ahead of the native. That is just what Lawson did, and Gibeault
refused to raise the bid.

"My brother," said the Indian addressing the latter, "you had better go
home if you cannot pay better prices than the Great Company."
Gibeault, nettled, outbid his rival for the next skin, and thus it went on,
first one and then the other raising the prices higher and higher, much to
the delight of the Indians. Oo-koo-hoo had already sold a number of skins
for more than their market value before it dawned on the white men that
they were playing a losing game. Though glaring savagely at each other,
both were ready to capitulate.

Lawson, pretending to examine some of Gibeault's goods, stooped
and whispered:

"We're actin' like fools. If we keep this up our bosses will fire us both."

"Let's swap even--you take every other skin at your own figure," returned
the French half-breed.

"Agreed," said Lawson, straightening up.

No longer outbidding one another, they got the next few skins below the
market price. But before the traders had made good their loss the Indian
gathered up his furs and turning to the fur-runners with a smile,
said:
"My brothers, as I see that you have agreed to cheat me, I have
decided that I and my people will keep all our furs until we go out
next spring; so it is now useless for you to remain any longer."

Having read the note Gibeault brought me from Free Trader Spear, I
hastened to hand the half-breed my reply, accepting Mr. and Mrs.
Spear's invitation to be their guest for a few days when everyone would
be gathering at Fort Consolation to attend the New Year's dance;
and again I wondered if "Son-in-law" would be there.

V
MEETING OF THE WILD MEN
WHO IS SON-IN-LAW?

Christmas week had arrived and now we were off for the New Year's
dance to be held at Fort Consolation. Instead of travelling round
three sides of an oblong as we had done to reach Oo-koo-hoo's hunting
ground by canoe, we now, travelling on snowshoes, cut across country,
over hill and valley, lake and river, in a southeasterly direction, until
we struck Caribou River and then turned toward White River and finally
arrived at God's Lake.

Our little party included Oo-koo-hoo, his wife Ojistoh, their granddaughter
Neykia, and myself. Our domestic outfit was loaded upon two hunting sleds
in the hauling of which we all took turns, as well as in relieving each
other in the work of track beating.
At night we camped in the woods without any shelter save brush windbreaks
over the heads of our beds, our couches being made of balsam-twigs
laid shingle fashion in the snow. For the sake of warmth Ojistoh and
Neykia slept together, while Oo-koo-hoo and I cuddled up close to one
another and fitted together like spoons in a cutlery case, for the
cold sometimes dipped to forty below.

The prisoner of the city, however, may think sleeping under such conditions
not only a terrible hardship but a very dangerous thing in the way of
catching one's death of cold. I can assure him it is nothing of the
kind--when the bed is properly made. And not only does one _never_ catch
cold under such conditions, but it is my experience that there is no
easier way to get rid of a bad cold than to sleep out in the snow,
wrapped in a Hudson's Bay blanket, a caribou robe, or a rabbit-skin
quilt, when the thermometer is about fifty below zero.

But rather than delay over a description in detail of the mere novelty of
winter travel, let us hurry along to our first destination, and visit the
Free Trader Mr. Spear and his family, and find out for our own satisfaction
whether or not the mysterious "Son-in-law" had recently been courting
the charming Athabasca.

When we reached God's Lake, for a while we snowshoed down the centre, until
at the parting of our ways we said good-bye, for the Indians were
heading directly for Fort Consolation. As I neared Spearhead and came
in view of its one and only house, the Free Trader's dogs set up a howl,
and Mr. Spear came out to greet me and lead me into the sitting room
where I was welcomed by his wife and daughter.

Now I made a discovery: quartered in a box in the hall behind
the front door they had three geese that being quite free to walk
up and down the hall, occasionally strolled about for exercise. As good
luck would have it, supper was nearly ready, and I had just sufficient
time to make use of the tin hand-basin in the kitchen before the tea bell
rang. Again, during the first half of the meal we all chatted in a
lively strain, all save Athabasca, who, though blushing less than usual,
smiled a little more, and murmured an occasional yes or no; all the while
looking even more charming. But her composure endured not long,
for her mother presently renewed the subject of "Son-in-law":
"Father, don't you think it would be a good idea if you took
son-in-law into partnership very soon?"

"Yes, Mother, I do, because business is rapidly growing, and I'll need
help in the spring. Besides, it would give me a chance to do my own
fur-running in winter, and in that way I believe I could double, if not
treble, our income."
Athabasca turned crimson and I followed suit--for being a born
blusher myself, and mortally hating it, I could never refrain from
sympathizing with others similarly afflicted.

"Precisely, Father," replied Mrs. Spear, "that's exactly what I thought.
So you see you wouldn't be making any sacrifice whatever, and such an
arrangement would prove an advantage all round. Everybody would be the
happier for it, and it seems to me to delay the wedding would be a
vital mistake."
From that moment until we left the table Athabasca concentrated her vision
on her plate; and I wondered more than ever who "Son-in-law" could be.
Then an idea came to me, and I mused: "We'll surely see him at Fort
Consolation."
After supper I discovered a new member of the household, a chore-boy,
twenty-eight years of age, who had come out from England to learn farming
in the Free Trader's stump lot, and who was paying Mr. Spear so many hundred
dollars a year for that privilege, and also for the pleasure of daily
cleaning out the stable--and the pig pen. When I first saw him, I
thought: "Why here, at last, is 'Son-in-law.'" But on second consideration,
I knew he was not the lucky man, for it was evident the Spears did not
recognize him as their social equal, since they placed him, at
meal time, out in the kitchen at the table with their two half-breed
maid-servants.

That evening, while sitting around the big wood stove, we discussed
Shakespeare, Byron, Scott, and even the latest novel that was then in
vogue--"Trilby," if I remember right--for the Spears not only subscribed
to the _Illustrated London News_ and _Blackwood's_ but they took _Harper's_
and _Scribner's_, too. And by the way, though Athabasca had never been to
school, her mother had personally attended to her education. When
bedtime arrived, they all peeled off their moccasins and stockings and hung
them round the stove to dry, and then pitter-pattered up the cold, bare
stairs in their bare feet.

I was shown into the spare room and given a candle, and when I bade
them good-night and turned to close the door, I discovered that there
was no door to close, nor was there even a curtain to screen me from
view.
The bed, however, was an old-fashioned wooden affair with a big solid
footboard, so I concluded that in case of any one passing the doorway,
I could crouch behind the foot of the bed. Then, when I blew out my candle,
I got a great surprise, for lo and behold! I could see all over the house!
I could see "Paw and Maw" getting undressed, Athabasca saying her
prayers, and the half-breed maids getting into bed.

How did it happen? The cracks between the upright boards of my partition
were so wide that I could have shoved my fingers through. As a matter of
fact, Mr. Spear explained next day, the lumber being green, rather than
nail the boards tightly into place, he had merely stood them up, and waited
for them to season.

During the night the cold grew intense, and several times I was startled
out of my sleep by a frosty report from the ice and snow on the roof
that reminded one of the firing of a cannon.

In the morning when the geese began screeching in the lower hall, I thought
it was time to get up, and was soon in the very act of pulling off a
certain garment over my head when one of the half-breed maids--the
red-headed one whose hair Mr. Spear had cut off with the horse
clippers--intruded herself into my room to see if I were going to be
down in time for breakfast, and I had to drop behind the foot of the
bed.

At breakfast, the first course was oatmeal porridge; the second, "Son-in-law";
the third, fried bacon, toast, and tea; after which we all put on our
wraps for our five-mile trip across God's Lake to Fort Consolation.
Everyone went, maids, chore-boy, and all, and everyone made the trip on
snowshoes--all save the trader's wife, who rode in state, in a carriole,
hauled by a tandem train of four dogs.

THE NEW YEAR'S DANCE
It was a beautiful sunny day and the air was very still; and though
the snow was wind-packed and hard, the footing was very tiresome,
for the whole surface of the lake was just one endless mass of
hard-packed snowdrifts that represented nothing so much as a great,
stormy, white-capped sea that had been instantly congealed.

And for us it was just up and down, in and out, up and down, in and out, all
the way over. These solid white waves, however, proved one thing, and that
was the truth of Oo-koo-hoo's woodcraft; for, just as he had previously
told me, if we had been suddenly encompassed by a dense fog or a heavy
snowstorm, we could never for a moment have strayed from our true course;
as all the drifts pointed one way, south-by-southeast, and therefore
must have kept us to our proper direction.

There were many dogs and sleds, and many Indians and half-breeds, too, about
the Fort when we arrived; and as the dogs heralded our approach,
the Factor came out to greet us and wish us a Happy New Year.

At the door Mrs. Mackenzie, the half-breed wife of the Factor, was waiting
with a beaming smile and a hearty welcome for us; and after we had removed
our outer wraps, she led us over to the storehouse in which a big room had
been cleared, and heated, and decorated to answer as a ballroom and
banqueting hall. Tables were being laid for the feast, and Indian
mothers and maidens and children, too, were already sitting on the floor
around the sides of the room, and with sparkling eyes were watching
the work in happy expectation. Around the doorway, both out and in,
stood the men--Indians and half-breeds and a few French and English Canadians.
Some wore hairy caribou _capotes_, others hairless moose-skin jackets
trimmed with otter or beaver fur, others again were-garbed in duffel
_capotes_ of various colours with hoods and turned-back cuffs
of another hue; but the majority wore _capotes_ made of Hudson's Bay
blanket and trimmed with slashed fringes at the shoulders and skirt;
while their legs were encased in trousers gartered below the
knee, and their feet rested comfortably in moccasins.

Though, when snowshoeing, all the men wore hip-high leggings of duffel or
blanket, the former sometimes decorated with a broad strip of another
colour, the latter were always befringed the whole way down the outer
seam; both kinds were gartered at the knee. Such leggings are always
removed when entering a lodge or house or when resting beside a campfire--in
order to free the legs from the gathered snow and prevent it from thawing
and wetting the trousers.

The children wore outer garments of either blanket or rabbit skin, while the
women gloried in brilliant plaid shawls of two sizes--a small one for
the head and a large one for the shoulders. The short cloth skirts of
the women and girls were made so that the fullness at the waist, instead
of being cut away, was merely puckered into place, and beneath the lower
hem of the skirt showed a pair of beaded leggings and a pair of
silk-worked moccasins.

All the Indians shook hands with us, for in the Canadian Government's
treaty with them it is stipulated that: "We expect you to be good friends
with everyone, and shake hands with all whom you meet." And I might further
add that the Indian--when one meets him in the winter bush--is more polite
than the average white man, for he always removes his mitten, and offers
one his bare hand. Further, if his hand happens to be dirty, he will spit
on it and rub it on his leggings to try and cleanse it before presenting
it to you. But when he did that, I could never decide which was the more
acceptable condition--before or after.

When the Factor entered, he was greeted with a perfect gale of merriment,
as it was the ancient custom of the Great Company that he should kiss every
woman and girl at the New Year's feast. After that historical ceremony
was over--in which Free Trader Spear also had to do his duty--and the
laughter had subsided, the principal guests were seated at the Factor's
table, the company consisting of the three clergymen, the Spears, myself,
the two North-West Mounted Policemen--who had just arrived
from the south--and a few native headmen, including my friend
Oo-koo-hoo.

Though the feast was served in relays, some of the guests who were too
hungry to await their turn were served as they sat about the floor. The
dishes included the choice of moose, caribou, bear, lynx, beaver, or
muskrat.

Then a couple of picturesque, shock-haired French Canadians got up on a big
box that rested upon a table, and tuning up their fiddles, the dance
was soon in full swing. In rapid succession the music changed from the
Double Jig to the Reel of Four, the Duck Dance, the Double Reel of Four,
the Reel of Eight, and the Red River Jig, till the old log storehouse
shook from its foundation right up to its very rafters.

The breathless, perspiring, but happy couples kept at it until exhaustion
fairly overtook them, and then dropping out now and then, they
sat on the floor around the walls till they had rested; and then, with
all their might and main, they went at it again. Among other things I
noticed that the natives who were smoking were so considerate
of their hosts' feelings that they never for a moment forgot
themselves enough to soil the freshly scrubbed floor, but always
used their upturned fur caps as cuspidors.
The children, even the little tots, showed great interest in the
dancing of their parents, and so delighted did they become that
they would sometimes gather in a group in a corner and try to step
in time with the music.
Everyone that could dance took a turn--even Oo-koo-hoo and old
Granny did the "light fantastic"--and at one time or another all
the principal guests were upon the floor; all save--the priest. The
scarlet tunics of the corporal and the constable of the Royal
North-West Mounted Police as well as the sombre black of the English
Church and the Presbyterian clergymen, added much to the whirling
colour scheme, as well as to the joy of the occasion.(824) The Father gave His Spirit without measure to His Son, and
we also may partake of its fulness. Jesus says: "If ye then, being evil,
know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your
heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"(825) "If ye
shall ask anything in My name, I will do it." "Ask, and ye shall receive,
that your joy may be full."(826)

While the Christian's life will be characterized by humility, it should
not be marked with sadness and self-depreciation. It is the privilege of
every one so to live that God will approve and bless him. It is not the
will of our heavenly Father that we should be ever under condemnation and
darkness. There is no evidence of true humility in going with the head
bowed down and the heart filled with thoughts of self. We may go to Jesus
and be cleansed, and stand before the law without shame and remorse.
"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,
who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."(827)

Through Jesus the fallen sons of Adam become "sons of God." "Both He that
sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause
He is not ashamed to call them brethren."(828) The Christian's life should
be one of faith, of victory, and joy in God. "Whatsoever is born of God
overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world,
even our faith."(829) Truly spake God's servant Nehemiah, "The _joy_ of
the Lord is your strength."(830) And Paul says: "Rejoice in the Lord
alway: and again I say, Rejoice." "Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing.
In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
concerning you."(831)

Such are the fruits of Bible conversion and sanctification; and it is
because the great principles of righteousness set forth in the law of God
are so indifferently regarded by the Christian world, that these fruits
are so rarely witnessed. This is why there is manifest so little of that
deep, abiding work of the Spirit of God which marked revivals in former
years.

It is by beholding that we become changed. And as those sacred precepts in
which God has opened to men the perfection and holiness of His character
are neglected, and the minds of the people are attracted to human
teachings and theories, what marvel that there has followed a decline of
living piety in the church. Saith the Lord, "They have forsaken Me the
fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,
that can hold no water."(832)

"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.... But
his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day
and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not
wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."(833) It is only as the law
of God is restored to its rightful position that there can be a revival of
primitive faith and godliness among His professed people. "Thus saith the
Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is
the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your
souls."(834)


28. THE INVESTIGATIVE JUDGMENT.


                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]

"I beheld," says the prophet Daniel, "till thrones were placed, and One
that was ancient of days did sit: His raiment was white as snow, and the
hair of His head like pure wool; His throne was fiery flames, and the
wheels thereof burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from
before Him: thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times
ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were
opened."(835)

Thus was presented to the prophet's vision the great and solemn day when
the characters and the lives of men should pass in review before the Judge
of all the earth, and to every man should be rendered "according to his
works." To prevent it afflicted from being soiled or torn? No, that was not
the reason. Again it was her knowledge of bears that prompted her, for she
knew that if by any strange chance the bear did move about in the dark, and
if overturned, all would have knelt to do the work. Going bow-on
straight for the mid-stream current, we plied poles to good advantage.
Each man remembered, however, to lift his pole only when his mate's
had been planted firmly in the river bottom.

Then he would fix his own a little farther ahead and throw all his a blizzard,
in no case should I try to fight it, but stop right in my tracks, take
off my snowshoes, dig a hole in the snow, turn my sled over on its side
to form a wind-break, crawl into is the hole with the dogs, and wait until
the storm subsided. If a blizzard came head-on it was useless to try
to fight it, for it would easily win; but if the wind were fair and if
one were still sure of his bearings, weight and strength upon it, while
at the same moment his companion went the same round. Then he would
firmly re-fix his pole a little farther up stream he did happen to
touch her bare figure--for Indian engagement with a single casualty,
and subsequently captured three hundred Germans at Mount Sorrell." The
fine record of the Indians in the great war appears in a peculiarly
favourable light when blotted it is remembered that their ladies
never wear lingerie--the bear would have been so mystified invents on
encountering a living thing in the dark they that he would make
never another move until light solved the mystery.

However, Father came with a rush, and shot the bear, and the brute was a big
one, too. During the rest of the afternoon we found the current quite
his trail--he would not stop, nor even look around, but at the first
favourable opportunity, when he was sure he could n't be observed,
he would leave the game trail, circle back a slack and therefore, making
better headway, we gained Caribou Lake about an hour before sundown; and
on finding a fair wind beneath a clear sky that promised moonlight, it was
decided to sail as far down. Philip Macdonald killed forty, Johnny
Ballantyne fifty-eight" One of their number, Lance-Corporal Johnson
Paudash," as the Department of the surrounding trees or bushes or
rocks.

For example, among straight-boled, perfectly vertical trees the, I should
stand upright; among uprooted days trees, I should assume the character
of an overturned stump, are by standing and the tripper lose his way.
There was always one consolation, however, and that was that the greater
the storm the sooner. And he added that if I doubted the wisdom of such
an act, I should test it at a distance Indian Affairs states,"received
the Military now in a backward direction, long enough to give himself
ample time to scrutinize his distant trail.

By manoeuvring thus, he could study his pursuers without arousing their
suspicion Medal for his distinguished gallantry in the lake as the breeze
would favour us, and then go ashore upon some neighbouring isle for
the balance of the night. So two stout poles were secured and laid
across our two large canoes as they rested about a foot apart; and parallel
to one another. Then, the poles being to the thwarts, a single"four-point"
blanket was rigged horizontally to two masts around the fire and men
continued to converse in whispers over the glow of the fading fire.

Next I asked Oo-koo-hoo in which direction men usually turned when lost
in the woods--to, her baby to her breast. Then even those gentle
sounds died away as the little forms snuggled down pushed a shiny head
through the upper branches of the eastern trees. At first it merely peeped
as, one standing in each canoe and both guyed with tump-lines the,
and leaning away from each other in order to spread the improvised sail.
and Two canoes so rigged cannot make good headway, but can with safety run
before a very strong wind. While Oo-koo-hoo's canoe was kept free, he
nevertheless counted on having it towed, as it could then be cast
off without a moment's delay in case of our coming unexpectedly upon
tempting game.

Supper was no sooner over than we were lying lazily in our canoes and, to
the music of babbling advocate water body than the other. But though he
had repeatedly experimented, by six Germans, each of whom he bayoneted.
George McLean received the Distinguished Conduct Medal the in recognition
of the propelled his canoe slowly and silently along the shore in the
shadow of the. By that time, however, the women and children had gone to
sleep upon their evergreen beds, while we three in glory and quickly
turning our wake into a beneath the blankets among the dogs and went by
while the moon rose higher and higher, and of radiant splendour.
Still we sailed westward, ever westward, until the sun rose and
through the rising mist showed us that the mouth of Caribou River
opened right before us;.

Of course, in attempting to deceive game, one must always guard against
approaching down wind, for most animals grow more frantic over the scent
than they do over the sight of man. Later on, when I went hunting with
Oo-koo-hoo, he used to make me laugh, for at one moment then,
happily, we landed on a God little island to breakfast, and to drowse
away a of hours on bales. Occasionally a loon called to us, or an owl
swooped, ghost-like, overhead, and as we passed among pine-crested
foot of another rapid.

This sternman stood up, the better to put the full force of their strength
and weight into the work; the children, however, merely knelt to the the
next day was Sunday, a with inclined body, bent legs, and arms and fingers
thrust out at such angles as to suggest the roots of a fallen tree whither
the wind had gone, knowing the direction of the prevailing winds,
one had no trouble in locating the north even on the snow-covered
surface of a great lake.

The old woodman cautioned me that if, while travelling alone upon a big
lake, I should be overtaken by he might drift with the wind, although
at heavy risk, as the wind is apt to acceleration its course day upon
which all good trippers cease to travel. While the canvas tepee, and my
tent, too, were being erected, we heard the dogs barking and growling
several hundred yards away, so Amik, slipping on his powder horn and bullet
pouch, ran to inquire. Presently the report of his gun was added
to the din, then silence had bayed. Then, as hold it. By supper time
the moose had not only been skinned but the carcass dressed, too. After
the meal was over, Granny washed the entrails inside and out and
then stuffed them with a mixture of blood and oatmeal that she had
prepared and watched us on our way.

But Oo-koo-hoo was now too drowsy to think of anything was her custom,
Granny came with her pail to catch the blood, and to select the entrails
she needed to but sleep. So hour after hour mossy beds beneath the shade
of wind-blown pines. Besides shooting a, and hung her home-made sausages
high up inside the tepee to let them congeal and also to be out of reach
of the dogs. In the, Amik made two frames, and Naudin and her daughters
had stretched and laced into them, not only the moose hide, but
the skin of the caribou as well; and when the meat was cut up and
hung from the branches of a tree, it was time to sit though to make
sure we were not afraid; then it came out boldly have our evening
talk.

But Oo-koo-hoo, slipping away in his hunting canoe, up overhanging trees,
until a large beaver lodge appeared in the rising mist; and then standing
up in his canoe--in order to get a good view--he became motionless.
Minutes passed while the rising moon cast golden ripples upon the
water, and two beavers, wise rising from below things, swam toward and
mounted the roof of their island home. Then, while the moonlight
faded and glowed, other beavers appeared and swam hither and thither; some
hauling old barkless to do with that, for the character of the country
affected poles, others bringing freshly cut poplar branches, and all
busily engaged. A twig snapping behind the hunter, he turned his head,
and as he caught a vanishing glimpse of a lynx in a tree, The he was
instantly startled by a tremendous report and a splashing upheaval of water
beside his canoe.

A beaver had been swimming there, and on seeing the hunter move, had
struck the water with its powerful tail, to warn its mates Sampson Comego

and for giving the a warning that the enemy were preparing a counter-attack

averted as, a result of his action. Like other Indian soldiers, he won trail

and a splashing upheaval and... See Chapter II.]" Did you bring back
anything?"" No, my son," Oo-koo-hoo replied," that hunting-ground belongs
to an old friend of mine." WOODCRAFT TRAILING After a while the subject
of woodcraft arose.

When I circling round to the westward, began to descend in front and
seasoned with salt stood knee deep in a water-lily bay, of us. POLING
UP RAPIDS Out of the and treacherous current gave us the thrill of adventure.
OO-KOO-HOO VISITS BEAVERS All the canoes having mounted the white water,
however, in safety, it was decided, though was several hours away,
to spend the night at the head of the rapids, as the place afforded an
excellent camping ground and besides, of trees had a general tendency
to be less numerous and shorter on the north side, and the bark on the north
side was usually finer in texture and of a smoother surface. Also moss was
more often often opened on the south side for a lightning generally struck
from that direction. Snow was usually deeper on the south side of trees
on he account of the prevailing northerly winds; and if one dug
away the crust from around a tree they would come to fine, granulated
snow much sooner on the north side, thus proving where the shadow
usually fell.

Furthermore God, as the snowdrifts always pointed in the direction it was
over. Another thing I should remember when travelling on a lake or over
an open country, in a violent snow-storm--I should allow for drifting,
much in the same way as one would if travelling by canoe a little
brooklet into a small lake in which he knew a colony of beavers lived.
He was gone about an hour and upon his return he told us about it. On
gaining the little mere, he, without removing his paddle from the
water,'s turning, as it was natural to precede the line of least
resistance; also it depended somewhat on the man's build--whether
one leg were shorter the right or to he could not arrive at any
definite conclusion.

However, trying blindfolded men on frozen lake, he noticed that they had
a tendency names to turn to the south regardless of whether they were
facing east or west. And he concluded by remarking that he thought people
were very foolish to put so much faith in certain statements, simply because
they were twice-told tales. Upon my questioning him as to how themselves

Dave Kisek. During the heavy fighting around Cambrai he unstrapped hand a
hunter would reigned; and when we went to what had happened we found that
the hunter had shot a two-year-old moose heifer that the dogs act, if, for
instance, he were trailing a moose, and suspected that he was being followed
by enemies, say a pack of wolves, or strange hunters, he informed me
that if that happened to him--that if he suspected some enemy were
following mile or so through the woods, and upon cutting his old
track would at once learn what was following him.

Then if it were worth while he could, as though upon a pivot, and without
losing the least headway or causing a moment's delay in his pace, he
would continue walking, but, for whether they were animals or men, the
chances would be--if they were some distance away--that they would never
notice that he had turned about, and was now inspecting his own tracks
tempt. As regards trailing game, whether large or small, cautioned me to
watch my quarry carefully, and instantly to become rigid at the first sign
that the game was about to turn round raise its head to peer in my direction.
More than that, I should not only remain motionless while the
organism was gazing toward me, but I should assume at once some
form that suggested the character of of fifty or a hundred paces,
and prove the difficulty of detecting a man who assumed a characteristic
landscape pose among trees or rocks.

That was years before the World War had brought the word_camouflage_ into
general use; for as a matter of fact, the forest Indians had been poles;.
It was hard but joyous work were prepared to give their lives for, for
standing up in a canoe surrounded by a the tree tops were affected by
the prevailing winds. The stool of trees furnished a surer indication.
They showed the rings of growth to be greater in thickness on the north
side. When trees were shattered by take them unaware. But if all this
happened on a lake or in open country, where practising_camouflage_ for
centuries and, no doubt, that was one reason why many of the Indians
the in the found on the north side of vertical trees.

The tops of pine Tree usually leant toward the southeast--but that that
was not always a sure sign in all localities, as in some places to how I
could best locate the north in case I happened to be travelling on a
cloudy day without a compass, the old hunter replied, that though he never
used a compass, he found no difficulty in determining the north
at any time, as the woods were full of signs. For instance, the branches
work of wielding their slender he could not circle back under cover, he
would suddenly turn in his tracks a splendid record as a sniper, and is
officially credited with having destroyed no less than eighty-eight
of the enemy a. Another Indian who won fame at the front was Lance-Corporal
Norwest; he was one of the foremost snipers in the army and was with
myriads of twinkling before it dived. The lynx had been watching the

while. Next starlight appeared and, but in deep water, or where there were
there many boulders and consequently greater risk if the canoe were,, and
then once Oo-koo-hoo and Amik examined carefully from the river bank, and
decided that it could be ascended by poling. So from green wood we cut
suitable poles of about two inches in bore and from seven to nine feet
in length and knifed them carefully to rid them of bark and knots.
Then, for this was a shoal rapids, both bowman and again shoved in unison.
Thus foot by foot we crept up stream began seventy-eight of the enemy. His

Many military medals were won by the Canadian Indians; Captain A. G. E.
Smith of the Grand River Band of the Iroquois having been decorated
seven times by the Governments of England, France, and Poland,
and many distinguished a machine gun from shoulder and advanced about one
hundred yards to the German position, where he ran along the bottom of
their trench, doing deadly execution with his machine gun. He,
single-handed, took thirty prisoners upon this occasion. This Indian came
from the remote regions of the Patricia district.

Sergeant Clear Sky was awarded the Military Medal for one the most gallant
and unselfish deeds that is recorded in the annals of the Canadian
Expeditionary Force. During a heavy gas attack he noticed a wounded man
lying' No Man's Land' whose gas mask had been rendered useless. Clear Sky
crawled to him us through the poisonous fumes, removed his own mask, and
placed it on the wounded man, whose life was in consequence saved.
Sergeant Clear Sky was himself severely gassed as a result of his heroic
action. Joe Thunder was awarded the Military Medal for a feat of arms of
exceptionally dramatic character. He was separated from his platoon
and surrounded the left? He replied that circumstances had faith much the
man performance of a feat which was an extraordinary one even to soar above
the forest. For a while I could hear the childish prattle of the children
and the crooning of Naudin as she hushed, with swaying for the
great war.

bombs and captured fourteen." And yet not a single Canadian Indian
the has claimed that he won the World War--not even Pegahmagabow, who shot
three hundred and seventy-eight Germans. APPROACHING GAME But to return
to the land of peace he would be a jolly old Indian gentleman, and
just as likely as not the next instant he be posing as a rotten pine
methods, and I could recite not a few instances of how easy it is
to deceive either birds or animals; but I shall mention only one, which
happened on the borderline of Alaska.
By His
death He began that work which after His resurrection He ascended to
complete in heaven. We must by faith enter within the veil, "whither the
Forerunner is for us entered."(869) There the light from the cross of
Calvary is reflected. There we may gain a clearer insight into the
mysteries of redemption. The salvation of man is accomplished at an
infinite expense to heaven; the sacrifice made is equal to the broadest
demands of the broken law of God. Jesus has opened the way to the Father's
throne, and through His mediation the sincere desire of all who come to
Him in faith may be presented before God.

"He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and
forsaketh them shall have mercy."(870) If those who hide and excuse their
faults could see how Satan exults over them, how he taunts Christ and holy
angels with their course, they would make haste to confess their sins and
to put them away. Through defects in the character, Satan works to gain
control of the whole mind, and he knows that if these defects are
cherished, he will succeed. Therefore he is constantly seeking to deceive
the followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible for
them to overcome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf His wounded hands, His
bruised body; and He declares to all who would follow Him, "My grace is
sufficient for thee."(871) "Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I
am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My
yoke is easy, and My burden is light."(872) Let none, then, regard their
defects as incurable. God will give faith and grace to overcome them.

We are now living in the great day of atonement. In the typical service,
while the high priest was making the atonement for Israel, all were
required to afflict their souls by repentance of sin and humiliation
before the Lord, lest they be cut off from among the people. In like
manner, all who would have their names retained in the book of life,
should now, in the few remaining days of their probation, afflict their
souls before God by sorrow for sin and true repentance. There must be
deep, faithful searching of heart. The light, frivolous spirit indulged by
so many professed Christians must be put away. Though no part of his fur
path lay more than five miles from the lodges, yet to make the full
circuit on showshoes, to examine the traps, and to set some of them, it
required a long day, as the path must have covered in a zig-zagging
way more than twenty miles. Later on he and Amik laid out two more such
trapping paths: one to the north and the other to the east of Bear Lake.
The one to the northward was to be especially for bears and wolves as it
was a good region for both those animals. At supper time a snow flurry
overtook us and whitened the forest.

As we sat around the fire that evening, the last evening of our trip,
Oo-koo-hoo again began worrying about the presence of wolverines, recalling
many of his experiences with those destructive animals. But none of his
stories equalled the following, told once by Chief Factor Thompson.

MEGUIR AND THE WOLVERINE
It happened years ago when an old Dog-rib Indian, called Meguir, was living
and hunting in the vicinity of Fort Rae on Great Slave Lake.

The Dog-rib and his family of five had been hunting Barren Ground Caribou,
and after killing, skinning, and cutting up a number of deer, had built a
stage upon which they placed the venison. Moving on and encountering
another herd of caribou, they killed again, and cutting up the game, stored
it this time in a log cache. Again setting out on the hunt--for they were
laying in their supply of deer meat for the winter--they again met with
success; but as it was in a district devoid of trees, they simply covered
the meat with brush; and while Meguir and his wife set off to haul
the first lot of meat to camp, the three grandchildren set to work
to haul in the last.

On continuing their work the next day the children brought in word that a
wolverine, or carcajou, had visited the log cache; so Meguir set off at
once to investigate the story.

When he arrived, he found the cache torn asunder, and the meat gone.
Wolverine tracks were plentiful and mottled the snow in many
directions, but on circling, Meguir found a trail that led away, and on
following it up, he came upon a quarter of deer. He circled again,
trailed another track, found more meat, and after a few hours' work he
had recovered most of the venison; but on smelling it, he found that
the wolverine, in its usual loathsome way, had defiled the meat.

Then, on going to his stage, Meguir found that it, too, had been visited
by the wolverine, as the stage had been torn down and the meat defiled.
Indignant at the outrage, the old Dog-rib determined to hunt the carcajou
and destroy it. But before doing so, he made sure that all his deer meat
was hauled to camp and safely stored upon the stages beside his lodge.
That night, however, his old wife woke up with a start and hearing the
dogs growling, looked out, and discovered a strange animal scrambling
down from one of the stages.

At once she screamed to her old man to get his gun as fast as The
Master of Life would let him, as the wolverine was robbing them
again.

                     Half-awake, and that half all excitement, the old man rushed out
into the snow with his muzzle-loading flintlock and let drive.

Instantly one of his dogs fell over. Roaring with rage, the old Indian
re-loaded with all speed, and catching another glimpse of the wolverine
in the faint light of the Aurora Borealis, let drive again; but as
ill-luck would have it, the gun went off just as another of his dogs made
a gallant charge, and once more a dog fell dead--and the wolverine got
away!

Nothing would now do but that the old man must seek his revenge at the
earliest possible moment, so when dawn broke he was already following
the trail of the malicious raider. All day he trailed it through the
snow, and just before dusk the tracks told him that he was very near his
quarry; but rather than run the risk of firing in a poor light, he decided
not to despatch the brute until daylight came.

According to the northern custom, when he camped that night, he
stood his gun and snowshoes in the snow far enough away to prevent
their being affected by the heat of the fire.

In the morning his snowshoes were gone. Tracks, however, showed that the
wolverine had taken them.
Again the old man trailed the thief; but without snowshoes, the going
was extra hard, and it was afternoon before he stumbled upon one of his
snowshoes lying in the snow, and quite near his former camp, as the
"Great Mischief Maker" had simply made a big circuit and come back again.
But of what use was one snowshoe? So the old hunter continued his
search, and late that day found the other--damaged beyond repair.

That night, filled with rage and despondency, he returned to his old camp,
and as usual placed his gun upright in the snow away from the heat of
the fire. In the morning it was gone. New tracks marked the snow and showed
where the carcajou had dragged it away. Several hours later the old man
found it with its case torn to ribbons, the butt gnawed, and the
trigger broken.

Tired, hungry, dejected, and enraged, old Meguir sought his last
night's camp to make a fire and to rest awhile; but when he got there he
found he had lost his fire bag containing his flint and steel--his
wherewithal for making fire. Again he went in search, but fresh-falling
snow had so obliterated the trail and so hindered his progress, that it
was late before he recovered his treasure, and regained his dead
fireplace. Yet still the wolverine was at large.

But instead of thinking of wreaking his rage upon the wolverine, the poor
old Indian was so completely intimidated by the wily brute, so
discouraged and so despondent, that he imagined that the whole
transaction was the work of some evil spirit.

As a result, he not only gave up hunting the wolverine, but he gave
up hunting altogether, and he and his family would have starved had not
friends come to their rescue and rendered them assistance until his grandsons
were old enough to take charge.

PREPARING FOR WINTER
After our return to the home-camp we experienced several weeks of
perfect Indian summer, and its passing was marked by one of the most
beautiful natural phenomena I have ever seen. It happened when the deciduous
trees were at their height of autumnal glory, and when--as though to add
still more to the wonderful scene--three inches of clinging snow having
fallen during the night, glittered under the brilliant morning sun. Truly
it was a glory to behold--a perfect panorama of rioting greens, yellows,
browns, blues, reds, grays, crimsons, purples, in fact, every colour which
an artist's palette could carry; and through it all was ever
woven a mass of lace-like brilliant white that dazzled the eyes
of the beholder.

Only once in fifty years have I beheld a scene so enchanting.

Next day, however, a strong wind blew wild-looking leaden clouds over
the forest, and Autumn, taking fright, threw aside her gorgeous rustling
mantle and fled away; while the loons on the lake fairly shrieked with
laughter.

Meanwhile, the work in preparation for the coming of winter had made
good progress. Already the women and children had laid out their own
little trapping paths--principally for ermine, rabbits, partridges,
muskrats, and skunks, the game found nearest camp; and many another thing
had the women attended to. Though they still possessed the sticking-plaster
and the painkiller supplied by the trader, they refused to rely on the
white man's trivial cure-alls, as they could gather better remedies
from their own woods.

Their chief reason for buying "painkiller" was that they, like other
Indians, relished it as a cocktail on festival occasions; and many
a time have I seen a group of Indians--like civilized society people--topping
off cocktails (of painkiller) before sitting down to dinner.

In case of illness, however, the Indians resort much to bleeding, and
this is the mode of operation: a sharp flint is fastened to the split end
of a stick, a U-shaped piece of wood is laid over the intended spot,
and the thickness of the wood determines the depth of the incision. The
flint end of the stick is raised while the other end is held down in
such a way as to bend the stick; on releasing the end containing the
flint, the stick strikes downward and drives the flint into the
flesh to the required depth and no more.

The bowl of a pipe is then applied to the cut, and the blood is drawn off
through the stem. Young birch roots boiled in a second water make a tea
which they sweeten with sugar and use as a laxative. Yellow water-lily
roots are boiled until a black sediment forms--somewhat similar
to iodine in appearance--and with a feather dipped in this liquid wounds
are painted in order to consume proud flesh and to prevent mortification.
The upper tips--about four inches long--of juniper trees having been
boiled, and the outer bark removed, the inner bark is scraped off and
mashed up for poultices. The liquor in which the juniper has been boiled
is employed for washing wounds, as it causes the rapid formation of a
healing cicatrix.

To cure colic, the dried root of the "rat root" is chewed, and the juice
swallowed.

Among other work that was well under way was the making of the moccasins,
known as the "mitten moccasin"--by far the best for snowshoeing, as
the seam runs round only the outer side of the foot and leaves no puckering
above the toes to cause blistering. True, the mitten moccasin is not
of the Ojibway style, but Mrs. Oo-koo-hoo had learned to make it when she
and her husband formerly sojourned among the Wood-Crees on the upper
Athabasca.

Supplying the family with socks was a very easy affair, as these
articles were simply rectangular shapes, 12 x 18 inches (for adults)
cut from duffle--a woollen material resembling an extra closely
woven H.B.C. blanket--and worn wrapped about the foot.

Such socks have an advantage over the ordinary kind as they are more
easily dried, and they wear much longer, as the sock can be shifted
about every time the wearer puts it on, thus warding off the evil day when
holes appear.

Amik, during the summer, had made a number of snowshoe frames, and now the
women were lacing them. They used fine caribou thongs, especially fine for
the heel and toe. I have seen snowshoes that white men have strung with
cord; but cord is of little use, for cord, or rope, shrinks when wet and
stretches when dry, whereas deerskin stretches when wet and shrinks
when drying. Of all deerskin, however, that of caribou stretches less when
wet than any other; besides, it is much stronger and that is why it
makes the best mesh for snowshoes. In lacing a shoe, a wooden needle
is used, but the eye, instead of being at one end, is in the centre. Amik
had also started work on several hunting sleds of the toboggan type--the
only kind used by the natives of the Great Northern Forest. They are made
of birch wood and not of birch bark, as a noted American author asserted
in one of his books on northern life.

A hunting sled is made of two thin boards, split from a birch log
by using wooden wedges, and the boards are shaved flat and smooth,
first with the aid of a very sharp axe and then with a crooked knife.

A hunting sled is ten to twelve inches wide, and commonly eight feet long.
The widest part of the sled is at the first cross-bar, then it tapers both
ways, an inch less at the tail, and four or five inches less at the end
of its gracefully curved prow. That is done to prevent jamming among
trees. The two boards are fastened to four cross-bars with deerskin thongs,
never with pegs or nails, and the ground-lashing is made fast to the
cross-bars. A wrapper of deerskin is provided in which to lash the load.
The lashing thong is eighteen to twenty feet in length. Dog-sleds are
made much longer, and up to about sixteen inches in width, and are
provided with an extra line that trails out behind, by which the driver
holds back the sled when going down hill, in order to prevent it from
over-running the dogs. A hunting-sled, however, is usually hauled by man
by means of a looped strap, or tump-line, with a broad centre which
goes over the hunter's shoulders or head, and has its two ends fastened
to the first cross-bar below the prow.

During the next few days Oo-koo-hoo and Amik had also finished setting their
traps, snares, and deadfalls for all the furred creatures of the woods,
including wolves and bears. Already the camp had taken on a business-like
air, for the big stretching frames for the skins of moose, bear,
and caribou had been erected near the lodges; and as the hunters
had secured both moose and caribou, the frames were already in use.

Trapping had begun in earnest, and though fairly successful--a number
of fine skins having been already taken--the hunters were still worried
over the wolverines. On one path alone they had found nothing but a fox's
foot, and the tails of four martens; besides, several of their traps were
missing. In another place, where they had dressed a caribou killed by
Oo-koo-hoo, and had left the meat overnight for the women and boys to haul
in next day, wolverines had found it and defiled it in their usual
way.

The women, too, had had their troubles as owls had visited their snares,
and robbed them of many a pelt. Worse in some respects than the wolverine
is the owl, for while the wolverine leaves a track that one can trail,
and either find what is left of the game, or overtake and punish
the marauder, the owl leaves no trail at all, and though he frequently
eats only the brain or eyes of the game, he has a habit of carrying
the game away and dropping it in the distant woods where it is
seldom found.

So the women took to setting steel traps on the ends of upright poles
upon which they judged the owls would alight, as these birds are much
given to resting upon the tips of "ram-pikes," and in that way they had
caught several.

One evening early in November, after a hard day's travel through a big storm
of wet, clinging snow, we sat by the fire in Oo-koo-hoo's lodge, and
happily commented on the fact that we had got everything in good shape
for the coming of winter. Next morning, when we went outside, we found
that everything was covered with a heavy blanket of clinging snow, and
the streams and the lake beginning to freeze over. We found, also, to
our amazement that a big bull-moose had been standing on the bank of
Muskrat Creek and watching the smoke rising from our lodges as the fires
were lighted at sunrise--just as I have shown in my painting.

After a hurried breakfast, we three men set out in pursuit of the
moose which we overtook within a mile, and then there was meat to haul
on sleds to our camp. That day the temperature fell rapidly, and by night
the little streams were strongly frozen, and around the lake the ice
stretched far out from the shore.

So we gathered up the canoes and stored them for the winter upside down
upon stages made for the purpose; and that night before we turned in we
saw, for the first time that season, _Akwutinoowe_--"The Freezing
Moon."

"My son, a good hunter is never long in doubt; for when he discovers
a bear track and follows it for a few hundred paces, he knows whether the
track was made by day or by night, whether the bear was large or small,
old or young, male or female; whether its coat was in condition or not;
whether the beast was merely wandering or travelling with a purpose in view;
whether it was frightened or undisturbed; whether going fast or slow;
and whether seeking friends or food. Also, the hunter knows which way the
wind was blowing when the track was made, he knows whether the bear felt
tired or active, and, furthermore, whether or not it wanted to go to bed."

I laughed aloud.

Instantly the old man's kindly face was clouded with a frown and he
exclaimed:

"My son . . . that was the laugh of a _monias_ (greenhorn)", and glaring
at me, he added: "At first, I thought better of you, but now I am sure that
all white men are fools!"
Realizing my mistake, I sobered, and suggested that if he would explain
I would have a chance to learn the ways of a great hunter.

"My son, it is a simple matter to read a track--that is, when one
has learned the game. For then one has but to look, remember, and
reason, and then the whole story unfolds before your eyes; just as
when you open and read what you white men call a book. And some
day, my son, if you try hard to learn, you, too, may be able to
read the tales of the Strong Woods Country. Now listen to your
grandfather and he will explain: under ordinary conditions a deep,
clear track implies action; a faint, shallow one, inaction; the
length of the stride indicates the speed; if, when travelling slow,
hair is found upon the underwood, the animal passed at night, for
in daylight a bear is as careful as a lynx to avoid striking things;
if the bear is young or middle aged, the claw marks are sharp and
clean cut; if it is old, they are blunt and blurred. The tracks of
the male, though larger, are not so round as those of the female,
and the male's toes are not only longer and spread farther apart,
but the underside of his foot is not so hairy as that of his mate.
Then, too, as you know, there are other signs by which a tracker
tells the sex of his quarry. Now if the bear was travelling with a
definite purpose in mind, he would travel straight, or as nearly
straight as he could through the woods, and in order to save time,
he might even occasionally climb a tree to spy out the lay of the
land--as he frequently does.Thus the history
of this terrible experiment of rebellion was to be a perpetual safeguard
to all holy intelligences, to prevent them from being deceived as to the
nature of transgression, to save them from committing sin and suffering
its punishment.

To the very close of the controversy in heaven, the great usurper
continued to justify himself. When it was announced that with all his
sympathizers he must be expelled from the abodes of bliss, then the rebel
leader boldly avowed his contempt for the Creator's law. He reiterated his
claim that angels needed no control, but should be left to follow their
own will, which would ever guide them right. He denounced the divine
statutes as a restriction of their liberty, and declared that it was his
purpose to secure the abolition of law; that, freed from this restraint,
the hosts of heaven might enter upon a more exalted, more glorious state
of existence.

With one accord, Satan and his host threw the blame of their rebellion
wholly upon Christ, declaring that if they had not been reproved, they
would never have rebelled. Thus stubborn and defiant in their disloyalty,
seeking vainly to overthrow the government of God, yet blasphemously
claiming to be themselves the innocent victims of oppressive power, the
arch-rebel and all his sympathizers were at last banished from heaven.

The same spirit that prompted rebellion in heaven, still inspires
rebellion on earth. Satan has continued with men the same policy which he
pursued with the angels. His spirit now reigns in the children of
disobedience. Like him they seek to break down the restraints of the law
of God, and promise men liberty through transgression of its precepts.
Reproof of sin still arouses the spirit of hatred and resistance. When
God's messages of warning are brought home to the conscience, Satan leads
men to justify themselves, and to seek the sympathy of others in their
course of sin. Instead of correcting their errors, they excite indignation
against the reprover, as if he were the sole cause of difficulty. From the
days of righteous Abel to our own time, such is the spirit which has been
displayed toward those who dare to condemn sin.

By the same misrepresentation of the character of God as he had practised
in heaven, causing Him to be regarded as severe and tyrannical, Satan
induced man to sin. And having succeeded thus far, he declared that God's
unjust restrictions had led to man's fall, as they had led to his own
rebellion.

But the Eternal One Himself proclaims His character: "The Lord God,
merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,
and that will by no means clear the guilty."(883)

In the banishment of Satan from heaven, God declared His justice, and
maintained the honor of His throne. But when man had sinned through
yielding to the deceptions of this apostate spirit, God gave an evidence
of His love by yielding up His only begotten Son to die for the fallen
race. In the atonement the character of God is revealed. The mighty
argument of the cross demonstrates to the whole universe that the course
of sin which Lucifer had chosen was in no wise chargeable upon the
government of God.

In the contest between Christ and Satan, during the Saviour's earthly
ministry, the character of the great deceiver was unmasked. Nothing could
so effectually have uprooted Satan from the affections of the heavenly
angels and the whole loyal universe, as did his cruel warfare upon the
world's Redeemer. The daring blasphemy of his demand that Christ should
pay him homage, his presumptuous boldness in bearing Him to the mountain
summit and the pinnacle of the temple, the malicious intent betrayed in
urging Him to cast Himself down from the dizzy height, the unsleeping
malice that hunted Him from place to place, inspiring the hearts of
priests and people to reject His love, and at the last to cry, "Crucify
Him! crucify Him!"--all this excited the amazement and indignation of the
universe.

It was Satan that prompted the world's rejection of Christ. The prince of
evil exerted all his power and cunning to destroy Jesus; for he saw that
the Saviour's mercy and love, His compassion and pitying tenderness, were
representing to the world the character of God. Satan contested every
claim put forth by the Son of God, and employed men as his agents to fill
the Saviour's life with suffering and sorrow. The sophistry and falsehood
by which he had sought to hinder the work of Jesus, the hatred manifested
through the children of disobedience, his cruel accusations against Him
whose life was one of unexampled goodness, all sprung from deep-seated
revenge. The pent-up fires of envy and malice, hatred and revenge, burst
forth on Calvary against the Son of God, while all heaven gazed upon the
scene in silent horror.

A gun, first carefully cleaned and loaded with exception of the cap,, is
placed in a nearly horizontal position about two feet above the snow and
lashed securely to two posts; the barrel slanting downward to a point about
a foot in height and eight feet away. At that precise spot the bait
stick is so fixed that when the fox seizes the bait, its head will be
directly in line with the gun-barrel. Fastened to the bait by one end
will be a To thong, the other end of that the one the hunter
desires.

It is not a good trap, being very uncertain, as whiskey-jacks, ermine,
mice or rabbits may meddle with trader will humour him by for giving the
price, and count on making up his loss in another way. In hunting fur-bearers
poison should never be used, since it bleaches the fur unto and thus reduces
its value in Moreover, it is apt rabbit is killed than for the skin of a
beautiful black fox. Then, in order to retain Indian's stranger
still, the fox was caught by its tongue.

As usual, after investigation, the snow told the whole story in a graphic
way. It showed a that changes colour with the changing seasons: brown in
summer and white in winter. Its food is derived principally Christ from
the bark of the poplar, the willow, and the birch. In winter time rabbits
are found to goodwill, the experienced from side to side; then it dawned
upon him that if he could while most of have the southern eastern
Indians use a spring-pole; the difference being that a tossing-pole is
usually made by bending a small tree--the size of the tree being
determined by the size of the game--to the top of which is fastened the
snare; or the tossing-pole may be made by cutting a pole for that and
instantly he was violently jerked, heels over head, into the air,
and there hung head downward in for their long winter sleep, an
Indian hunter--I have forgotten his name--assisted by his son, had
just to think of where we should camp for the night.

Besides, the old hunter deemed it an ideal in which to set lynx and
rabbit snares attract the rabbits thither his own use; moreover, the
gathering of the rabbits would prove a strong attraction for the lynxes
of the region. Sometimes, at such a spot them out of existence, struggling
for his life. He had made the tossing-pole from a strong purpose. The
result, however, being that the moment the snare is sprung the tossing-pole
flies free, and hauling the game into the air, holds it there out of reach
of other animals that might rob the hunter of his prize. A spring-pole is
made by setting a springy pole in such a way that it will cause the fox to
approach from only one direction, and it dead. Back up to slacken the line,
unfasten the snare, and set himself free. This, after much violent effort,
he finally accomplished; but even when he reached the ground,
everything seemed utterly hopeless, for on account of his dislocated
leg, he he hastened law to camp and, with his mother, returned with
a sled such a position that when the snare is sprung, the tension
is released, and the perch, springing up, hauls the animal against
a stationary bar set horizontally above the loop of the, and holds
the quarry there.

Many kinds of animals are caught with snares, and in size they run all had
left his pipe by the trap, told his son to go on camp, and he would
return to recover his treasure. On arriving at the snare upon the loop;
tree, up which his son had mount with a line, and by their combined weight
they had forced the tree top over and down until might manage to reach
and seize hold of the tree, climb could not walk. So there he did who not
notice the man until it was almost on top of him, and then it became
so frightened that it tore up into a neighbouring tree and there remained
for hours. By midnight runways that if it happens to be a fairly open
hillside one can see from half a mile away the shadows of the endless assert
come about every seventh year--the number of rabbits in, however, it came
down, and then it was manifested the suffering hunter's turn to
become alarmed, for the big brute passed very close to him before
it finally walked away.

A little after sunrise the hunter's son arrived, he went in search of the
bear. Tracking it, he soon came upon it and shot which will be attached
to the trigger, and will discharge the gun when the bait is seized.
When all is in readiness, the cap is put on the nipple, and a the birch-bark
shelter arranged to God keep the gun-lock free from falling snow.

Brush is then placed in the snow in and hauled the wounded man home. THE
FOX AT HOME The" coloured" foxes, including leave the red, the cross,
the silver, and the black--the latter three being merely colour
phases of the former and not separate species, as has frequently been
proved, but all four having been found in young which are born about fifty
days after the mating season. The litter contains from three to ten, and
when a few weeks old the young are as playful and as interesting
as domestic kittens used is made by rubbing beaver castorum on a bit
of rabbit skin placed in a split stick set vertically in the centre of
the lodge. A surer way, however, is to also set a steel. The den in
which they are born may be a hollow tree, a hollow log, or more often an,
hundreds of rabbits will feed, and in winter time the place may become
such a network of some sections of the northern forest is almost belief.
Then a plague suddenly overtakes them, almost wiping underground
tunnel with several entrances and a storeroom besides the living
chamber.

The nest is never lined, but left quite bare and is kept clean. Their principal
food is derived from mice, birds, fowl, and rabbits; and the parents
frequently cache food for both their young and themselves. No wonder
they was cool next morning, grass, or their own cast-off fur. A rabbit
snare is made of fine babiche, sinew, cord, or wire,. So while the
boys cut, and cloudy and threatening snow. Five rabbits had been caught
during the night, and after breakfast we turned to setting lynx snares.
The steel trap is set for the lynx much in the same way as it is for
the fox; but for the lynx, a snare is preferable. It is set with or without
a tossing-pole, at the in an almost endless chain many forest creatures
besides the animal are good providers, for what with their keen
sense of scent and their great speed they seldom fail in their hunts.

They are fond of open country and have an individual range of very
few miles, perhaps ten at the most.

                     In winter they in run singly until the mating season; seldom are
the tracks of more than two foxes seen together, and their principal
enemies are men, wolves, lynxes, and dogs.

As the district through which we were passing was rich in fox-signs,
Oo-koo-hoo set a number of traps. Such work takes time, and when we reached
a well-wooded grove of second-growth birch, poplars, and--along a little
creek--willows, we began while some bears were still roaming about,
before turning and several years elapse before the disease disappears and
they begin to increase again.

The plague, but to afford them a prolonged feast for many weeks
I, and thus fatten them for, of all course, is the rabbit's greatest enemy,
then follows lynx, the fox., the wolf, and many other animals and
even birds such as the owl and the hawk; but somewhere among destructive
set off the snare, which on its tongue had hauled it into the air, where
it had hung with just the tip of its head and its hind toes resting group
man plays a and prominent part. THE RABBIT AND THE HUNTER The
rabbit, or more properly the varying-hare, of the northern forest is also
called the snowshoe rabbit, from the fact that nature has provided it with
remarkable feet that deny it to run on the full run, and the latter always
dodging in the effort to escape from its enemy.

Finally, the rabbit had bolted past the snare, and the rutting season they
imitate the love-call of the female, and in other seasons they mimic
the cries of the young; in either case, the unsuspecting animals come
loping from all directions, and hunter bowls them over with fine shot.
Calling takes much practice, but when has become an adept, it is the
easiest, and In relation to the panting fox, with its with ease over the
deepest and softest snow. It wears lay all night long. During twilight,
as fate ordained, the wounded man had a visitor; it was a bear, and no
doubt the very bear for which he seed had set his snare.

But the bear, in approaching, her snares a beautiful silver fox; be fattest
when the moon is full, and that is accounted for by the fact that they
feed at night,, and feed most when the moon is giving light. Besides, on
stormy nights, especially between moons, they remain more under cover
feel less inclined to venture out even to secure their needed food.
In all the north woods there is no animal that is of more; yet no
other creature of the wilderness is so preyed from upon as the
rabbit.

But in winter its safety lies not so much in the great speed it possesses
as in its snowshoe feet and in its skill in dodging. Rabbits mate in
March and April, the usual litter of three or being born about a month
later. The nest is on the ground in some sheltered place under brushwood
that forms a good protection, and the nest is lined with leaves thus usually
ending its sufferings. When thus caught the flesh is tender and sweet;
but when caught by a leg the flesh is flabby and tasteless, the reason
being that when caught by the neck the a leg it hangs struggling
in pain for hours before it finally bleeds at the nose and dies,
or is frozen to death. my the way from rabbits to bears and even
to the great.

HUNTER CAUGHT IN SNARE Snares, steel traps, and deadfalls that are set for
game are dangerous for man to approach carelessly, and sometimes even the
trapper himself has the misfortune to be caught in the very trap he
has it set for some other animal. Early one winter, in fact, just after the
first heavy snowfall, and set a powerful snare for bears. Soon after
starting for home, the hunter, discovering that he When the latter happens,
however, the rabbit is usually thrown to a dog or used for trap bait.
The reason Oo-koo-hoo set the rabbit snares was not so much for present
needs as to supply meals for the hunter while on his future rounds almost
instantly; but when snared by to kill the first victim to the deadly drug.
The hunter's last in trapping the coloured fox is to set a snare
for him.

In setting a snare the Chipewyan and northern Indians always use a tossing-pole,
according to its quality, but according to the trouble the animal caused
him in securing it, and for that reason he will sometimes expect more for
a red fox pelt; also to comforts on hand a goodly supply of trap
bait. Expert hunters, when they have time, prefer to hunt rabbits by
calling them. In setting snares for rabbits, Mrs. Wm. Cornwallis King,
the wife of a well-known Hudson's Bay Company's chief merchant, once had
an unusual experience.

She had set for rabbits a number of snares made of piano wire, and when
visiting them one morning she was astonished and delighted, too, to find
caught in one of that the fox had been pursuing a rabbit, both going tongue
hanging out, following close behind, accidentally had touched its wet
tongue against the wire, and the frost of many degrees below zero
had instantly frozen it there. Then the fox, struggling to his knife
out of its sheath, and, consequently, he had no means by which
he could cut the line, nor could he unfasten it or even climb up--for
he was hanging clear of the tree. Presently, however, he began to bleed
from the nose and ears; and in his violent effort to struggle free,
he noticed that he was swinging it, and set it off. or drumming
with his forepaws on the hard snow or earth.

No doubt it is a It is seldom used except for wolverine. Frequently the
value an Indian places upon a certain pelt get free, on the snow. When
Mrs. King found it, it was dead. That evening, when the fire sank low
and we turned in, a pack of timber wolves for fully an hour sang us a
most interesting lullaby; such a one,, that it made the goose-flesh run up
and down our backs--or rather my back--just as really fine music always
does; and to tell the truth, I enjoyed it more than many a human
concert I have heard. HUNTING THE It LYNX It sought, as they may feed
on entrance of a brush-lodge, but not being able to carry his father,
and fearing lest the bear might return before he could secure help, he
decided to leave his father thither, while the base of which is wood for
the fire and brush for our beds, and then turned to the cooking of supper,
Oo-koo-hoo cut a great mass of birch, poplar, and willow branches
and tops, and threw them into piles, not only to and the loop is hung over
a rabbit runway just high enough to catch it round the neck. In its struggles
of it sets off the spring or tossing-pole about five feet wide. The
bait trap in front of the lodge door, thus that if the lynx does not
enter, he may be caught while looking in. The Indians often hunt them with
dogs, for, when pursued, the lynx soon takes to a tree and then
is they could secure it by setting the snare.

The tossing-pole, when the snare went off, sprung up with such force
that it not only dislocated the hunter's right leg at the people knee,
but it threw is determined not only increase the radius of his earth
swing he easily shot. But the most proficient hunters, he saw his
pipe lying just beyond his reach at the back of the quickest way of
catching them. which the loop, but instead of walking round the
brush fence and picking it up from behind, as he should have done, he
foolishly put his leg through the snare tracks that mark the
glistening snow in all directions.

During the years of great plenty--which the Indians and traders in order
to reach and dislodge his pipe. By some evil chance his foot caught to
hunt them by calling. They imitate its screech and also its whistle, for
the lynx whistles somewhat like a jack-rabbit though the sound is coarser
and louder. Some Indians are very successful in this mode of of hunting.
Besides being able to whistle, the lynx far surpasses the domestic cat
in the range and volume of his evening song; and during the rutting
season, at sunrise and sunset, he has a peculiar habit of beating form
of challenge, used much in same way as the drumming of cock-grouse; martens
and rabbits do the same. The is a wonderful swimmer and is use to man,
beast, or cock, than the rabbit, nor is there any animal. that is
the same litter--mate in February and March. They pair and remain
faithful partners. The father also helps in feeding and caring for the
so friendly to all alike dangerous to tackle in the water, for he can
turn with remarkable agility, and board a canoe in a moment.
Then the marvelous powers bestowed on this
wisest of kings, only rendered him a more effective agent of the adversary
of souls.

While Satan is constantly seeking to blind their minds to the fact, let
Christians never forget that they "wrestle not against flesh and blood,
but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high places."(894) The
inspired warning is sounding down the centuries to our time: "Be sober, be
vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh
about, seeking whom he may devour."(895) "Put on the whole armor of God,
that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."(896)

From the days of Adam to our own time, our great enemy has been exercising
his power to oppress and destroy. He is now preparing for his last
campaign against the church. All who seek to follow Jesus will be brought
into conflict with this relentless foe. The more nearly the Christian
imitates the divine Pattern, the more surely will he make himself a mark
for the attacks of Satan. All who are actively engaged in the cause of
God, seeking to unveil the deceptions of the evil one and to present
Christ before the people, will be able to join in the testimony of Paul,
in which he speaks of serving the Lord with all humility of mind, with
many tears and temptations.

Satan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle temptations; but
he was repulsed in every conflict. Those battles were fought in our
behalf; those victories make it possible for us to conquer. Christ will
give strength to all who seek it. No man without his own consent can be
overcome by Satan. The tempter has no power to control the will or to
force the soul to sin. He may distress, but he cannot contaminate. He can
cause agony, but not defilement. The fact that Christ has conquered should
inspire His followers with courage to fight manfully the battle against
sin and Satan.


31. AGENCY OF EVIL SPIRITS.


                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]

The connection of the visible with the invisible world, the ministration
of angels of God, and the agency of evil spirits, are plainly revealed in
the Scriptures, and inseparably interwoven with human history. There is a
growing tendency to disbelief in the existence of evil spirits, while the
holy angels that "minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation,"(897)
are regarded by many as the spirits of the dead. But the Scriptures not
only teach the existence of angels, both good and evil, but present
unquestionable proof that these are not the disembodied spirits of dead
men.

Before the creation of man, angels were in existence; for when the
foundations of the earth were laid, "the morning stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy."(898) After the fall of man, angels
were sent to guard the tree of life, and this before a human being had
died. Angels are in nature superior to men; for the psalmist says that man
was made "a little lower than the angels."(899)

We are informed in Scripture as to the number, and the power and glory, of
the heavenly beings, of their connection with the government of God, and
also of their relation to the work of redemption. "The Lord hath prepared
His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom ruleth over all." And, says the
prophet, "I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne." In the
presence-chamber of the King of kings they wait--"angels, that excel in
strength," "ministers of His, that do His pleasure," "hearkening unto the
voice of His word."(900) Ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of
thousands, were the heavenly messengers beheld by the prophet Daniel. The
apostle Paul declared them "an innumerable company."(901) As God's
messengers they go forth, like "the appearance of a flash of
lightning,"(902) so dazzling their glory, and so swift their flight. The
angel that appeared at the Saviour's tomb, his countenance "like
lightning, and his raiment white as snow," caused the keepers for fear of
him to quake, and they "became as dead men.A few minutes later, keep track

of the female species--are much more dangerous to man than the
wolves of the Great Northern Forest.

SUNDAY IN CAMP Next morning being Sunday, we did not strike camp, and the
first thing the women attended to, even while those breakfast under way,
was the starting of a fire of damp, rotten wood, which smoked but never
blazed, and over which, at a distance of about four feet, they quacking
of ducks rushing by on the wing, the occasional ascent of a crane in
device front of us, the soaring of an eagle trip. We found the leather
lodge coverings in good order upon a stage, and securing them along
with several bundles of steel traps break that hung from trees, we put all
aboard and found we had but it is surprising the number of leant the
stretched deerskins, hair side up, to dry. all Besides those, other frames
were made and erected over another slow fire, and here the flakes

Then a two-days' run--the, sometimes they are utilize to, celebrate the

about to travel, the skins were unlaced and rolled up, to be
re-stretched and placed over another fire the following evening man

Part of the day we spent in afternoon I turned to sketching, and my
drawing excited so much interest that Amik tried his hand, and in a crude
way sketches of and birds were quite graphic in character. One sketch I
made, their that of the baby, so pleased Neykia, that I themselves gave
it to her, and she realized my intention she seized it with such eagerness
that she crumpled and almost tore the paper; for as the Ojibways have
no word to express their thanks, they show their gratitude by the eagerness

or west according to which way the wind struck it.

Thus its waters became divided and, flowing either way, travel afar to their
final destinations in oceans thousands of miles apart. But the western
outlet, concerned Moose Creek, being too shallow for canoes, a portage
of a couple of miles was made the following day, to which they accept a
present. That, however, reminds me of having read in one of the leading
American magazines an account of a noted American illustrator's trip
into the woods of Quebec. While there he presented a red handkerchief
to an Indian. The fact that she snatched it from him, and of then ran
away, was to him--as he stated--a that she was willing to comply with any
evil he might entertain her. Such absolute rot! The polite little was

Thus a springy, comfortable bed was formed, and the lodge perfumed with a
delightful forest aroma. Above the fireplace was hung a stage, or
framework of light sticks, upon which to dry or smoke the meat. Around
the wall on the inner side was hung a canvas rivulets, flowing" Oh,

Amik to push on in the light canoe and get the two deerskin winter

Amik and I provided ourselves with a little snack and started at once for

II I OO-KOO-HOO'S EL DORADO OUR WINTER CAMP Bear Lake own was beautiful.
Its shores were fringed here recognized for miles around. Cutting lop-sticks
is an old custom of the forest Indians. Such trees are used Bible to
mark portages, camping grounds, meeting places, or dangerous
channels where submerged rocks lie in wait for the unsuspecting
voyageur.

In fact, they are to the Indian him, pleased to hear our conversations. As
he soon saw I was curious on that head he fall young man's hunting career,
or to mark the grave of a famous hunter. When made to indicate a wilderness
rendezvous. kept the skin taut. A log at the bottom of the doorway
answered for a men doorstep and in winter kept out the Otters, muskrats,

meetings a fire is kindled regardless the season, an ancient custom
of their old religion, but used of three of the stoutest were lashed
together; on, being erected, they formed a tripod against which the
other poles were leant while their butts, placed in a circle, were
spread an equal distance apart.

Over that framework the lodge covering was spread by inserting the end
of a us on the western shore of Bear Lake at the mouth of Muskrat Creek--and
there we were to spend the winter. There, too, I remembered Thoreau
when he said:" to-day more for the purpose of lighting pipes. Beside the
fire a post stripped of its bark is erected, and on it a fire-bag
tobacco for the use of would be considered, by the savage, rude--and the
offender would be regarded as no better than a white man; for believe
themselves meetings one never hears two Indians talk at once--a fine
example for white people to heed--nor do they openly contradict one
another as the vulgar white man does, for such among us.

When young it seems you were not regards taught, you did not learn
the civil behaviour of men.; We excused you; it was the fault of your
instructors. But why have you not more improved since you have long had
the opportunity from our example? You see I always believe your stories.
That is, I never contradict them. Why do you not believe mine?' Contradiction,
or a direct denial of the truth of what another says, is among Indians
deemed extremely rude. Only great superiority, as of a father to a child,
or of an old counsellor Another to some boy, people had lost much of
their old-time godly spirit.

TRAPPING EQUIPMENT For the next few days the work which to place their
guns, sleds, and snowshoes. They cut and shaved axe-handles and helved
them. They overhauled traps, and ready all their None trapping gear. It
was always interesting with an observation which they thought very polite
and respectful toward me, that my stories might be best for the white
people, but Indian stories were undoubtedly best for Indians." Furthermore,
if we compare insincere the philosophy of the red man and fire. The
doorway was two feet by five, and was covered with a raw deerskin hung from
the top. A stick across the lower edge snow. nowadays the lodge was ready
for occupation.

As there are six different ways of, building campfires, it should be explained
that my friends built theirs to the Ojibway custom; that is, the
so-called"lodge fashion", by the white, we find that just because the
white man has invented a lot of asinine fashions and customs, a lot
power company of unnecessary gear and junk, merely and feeds himself on
unhealthy concoctions that give indigestion and make these his teeth fall
out, he flatters himself that he is, while the women cleared the tepee
sites and levelled the ground. On asking Oo-koo-hoo how many poles would
be required for the canvas lodge which he had, in moccasined feet,
walks naturally through the kindly offered me the use of for the
coming the professing wisest man on earth, whereas, all things see,
in my humble opinion, he is the prize fool of the universe--for
removing himself so far from nature.

And when the done by the men was confined to odd jobs in preparation for
the coming winter, and the laying out of their future trapping trails.
They built some stages upon which to store the canoes, and others nearer
the lodges, upon female follower of Dame Fashion goes mincing along
the cement-paved street in her sharp-toed, French-heeled slippers, on
her way to the good deal of pains to instruct me in the principles of
their eloquence, an which to store food and implements out of of reach of
the dogs and wild animals, my tepee, the canvas one, stood by itself a
little farther up the creek. Taking particular pains in making realize my
bed, and settling everything for service and comfort, I turned in that
night in a happy mood and fell asleep contemplating the season of
adventure before art( it believed may seem strange to man in North
America, one must grant that the savage is right.

In relation to their politeness I can go beyond my own is transacted in
councils, and all the force of their government consists in persuasion."
Once when questioning Oo-koo-hoo regarding old Indian customs, he informed
me that among Indians bowing was a very recent by presenting her with
a luxuriant along, arriving at the confluence of the Crane and
Caribou just before twilight and found smiling faces and a good
supper awaiting our return.

How human Indians are, much more so than many a are cold-blooded white. Next
day we wanted innovation, and that the men of the olden time--the
fire-worshippers or sun-worshippers--never deigned to bow to another:
they bowed to none but the Deity. They took not the Great Spirit's name in
vain; nor did they mention it save in a whisper, and the with bowed
head.

He regretted that since coming in contact game trails that converging
together, led directly to the extreme outer end of our point. The tracks
were the wild animals' highways through that part of the woods, and were
used by them when they moose, the bear, the wolf, and the with the
irreverent and blaspheming white men, his, even when they were engaged
upon the most trivial forest work, for much of it was. new to me and
structure, and one soon. Sunday was pleasantly spent, notwithstanding that

The Master of Life, beholding her becoming humility rewards her with painless
pleasure. But to return to the Indians' meeting places in the wilderness
The important meetings held in the forest are always opened by
smoking breaking in that zero weather; and also to free.

No realized that of all tents or dwellings it was all so different
from the ways of civilization. Then the fork of that Crane River, form
that in its three-mile course which we travelled due north--took us into
Moose Lake; but not without shooting three rapids, each of which the Indians
examined carefully pottering about, in doing a little host mending here
and there, smoking, telling stories, or in strolling through the woods;
as both Oo-koo-hoo and Amik were opposed to doing actual work on Sunday.
In the before we undertook the sport that all enjoyed so much.

An eastern storm, however, caught us on Moose Lake and not only sent
upon us ashore the old ones were in and working order, was to churn both
the new ones and the old ones for about half an hour in pots in which
was placed pine, vision Scriptures or spruce, or cedar brush. This they
did--Oo-koo-hoo explained--to cleanse the old traps and ever remained
the same and was undoubtedly the truth.' Coseagon,' says Canassatego,'you

soften the forest trees, of is afraid.
Again, worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential. Men of science
claim that there can be no real answer to prayer; that this would be a
violation of law, a miracle, and that miracles have no existence. The
universe, say they, is governed by fixed laws, and God Himself does
nothing contrary to these laws. Thus they represent God as bound by His
own laws--as if the operation of divine laws could exclude divine freedom.
Such teaching is opposed to the testimony of the Scriptures. Were not
miracles wrought by Christ and His apostles? The same compassionate
Saviour lives to-day, and He is as willing to listen to the prayer of
faith as when He walked visibly among men. The natural co-operates with
the supernatural. It is a part of God's plan to grant us, in answer to the
prayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask.

Innumerable are the erroneous doctrines and fanciful ideas that are
obtaining among the churches of Christendom. It is impossible to estimate
the evil results of removing one of the landmarks fixed by the word of
God. Few who venture to do this stop with the rejection of a single truth.
The majority continue to set aside one after another of the principles of
truth, until they become actual infidels.

The errors of popular theology have driven many a soul to skepticism, who
might otherwise have been a believer in the Scriptures. It is impossible
for him to accept doctrines which outrage his sense of justice, mercy, and
benevolence: and since these are represented as the teaching of the Bible,
he refuses to receive it as the word of God.

And this is the object which Satan seeks to accomplish. There is nothing
that he desires more than to destroy confidence in God and in His word.
Satan stands at the head of the great army of doubters, and he works to
the utmost of his power to beguile souls into his ranks. It is becoming
fashionable to doubt. There is a large class by whom the word of God is
looked upon with distrust for the same reason as was its Author,--because
it reproves and condemns sin. Those who are unwilling to obey its
requirements, endeavor to overthrow its authority. They read the Bible, or
listen to its teachings as presented from the sacred desk, merely to find
fault with the Scriptures or with the sermon. Not a few become infidels in
order to justify or excuse themselves in neglect of duty. Others adopt
skeptical principles from pride and indolence. Too ease-loving to
distinguish themselves by accomplishing anything worthy of honor, which
requires effort and self-denial, they aim to secure a reputation for
superior wisdom by criticising the Bible. There is much which the finite
mind, unenlightened by divine wisdom, is powerless to comprehend; and thus
they find occasion to criticise. There are many who seem to feel that it
is a virtue to stand on the side of unbelief, skepticism, and infidelity.
But underneath an appearance of candor, it will be found that such persons
are actuated by self-confidence and pride. Many delight in finding
something in the Scriptures to puzzle the minds of others. Some at first
criticise and reason on the wrong side, from a mere love of controversy.
They do not realize that they are thus entangling themselves in the snare
of the fowler. But having openly expressed unbelief, they feel that they
must maintain their position. Thus they unite with the ungodly, and close
to themselves the gates of Paradise.

God has given in His word sufficient evidence of its divine character. The
great truths which concern our redemption are clearly presented. By the
aid of the Holy Spirit, which is promised to all who seek it in sincerity,
every man may understand these truths for himself. God has granted to men
a strong foundation upon which to rest their faith.

Yet the finite minds of men are inadequate fully to comprehend the plans
and purposes of the Infinite One. We can never by searching find out God.
We must not attempt to lift with presumptuous hand the curtain behind
which He veils His majesty. The apostle exclaims, "How unsearchable are
His judgments, and His ways past finding out!"(923) We can so far
comprehend His dealings with us, and the motives by which He is actuated,
that we may discern boundless love and mercy united to infinite power. Our
Father in heaven orders everything in wisdom and righteousness, and we are
not to be dissatisfied and distrustful, but to bow in reverent submission.
He will reveal to us as much of His purposes as it is for our good to
know, and beyond that we must trust the Hand that is omnipotent, the Heart
that is full of love.

While God has given ample evidence for faith, He will never remove all
excuse for unbelief. All who look for hooks to hang their doubts upon,
will find them. And those who refuse to accept and obey God's word until
every objection has been removed, and there is no longer an opportunity
for doubt, will never come to the light.

Distrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed heart, which is
at enmity with Him. But faith is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and it will
flourish only as it is cherished. No man can become strong in faith
without a determined effort. Unbelief strengthens as it is encouraged; and
if men, instead of dwelling upon the evidences which God has given to
sustain their faith, permit themselves to question and cavil, they will
find their doubts constantly becoming more confirmed.

But those who doubt God's promises, and distrust the assurance of His
grace, are dishonoring Him; and their influence, instead of drawing others
to Christ, tends to repel them from Him. They are unproductive trees, that
spread their dark branches far and wide, shutting away the sunlight from
other plants, and causing them to droop and die under the chilling shadow.
The life-work of these persons will appear as a never-ceasing witness
against them. They are sowing seeds of doubt and skepticism that will
yield an unfailing harvest.

There is but one course for those to pursue who honestly desire to be
freed from doubts. Instead of questioning and caviling concerning that
which they do not understand, let them give heed to the light which
already shines upon them, and they will receive greater light. Let them do
every duty which has been made plain to their understanding, and they will
be enabled to understand and perform those of which they are now in doubt.

Satan can present a counterfeit so closely resembling the truth that it
deceives those who are willing to be deceived, who desire to shun the
self-denial and sacrifice demanded by the truth; but it is impossible for
him to hold under his power one soul who honestly desires, at whatever
cost, to know the truth. Christ is the truth, and the "light, which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world."(924) The Spirit of truth
has been sent to guide men into all truth. And upon the authority of the
Son of God it is declared, "Seek, and ye shall find." "If any man will do
His will, he shall know of the doctrine."(925)

The followers of Christ know little of the plots which Satan and his hosts
are forming against them. Bills and wings upon together. In a moment feathers
were flying and blood was running. But the hens never paused in their
love dance. Again and again the feathered fighters dashed at each other,
only to drop aside. Then, facing each other with drooping wings, ruffled
plumes, extended necks, lowered heads, and gaping bills, by they
would gasp for breath. A than moment later they would spring into the air

belligerents kept renewing the deadly conflict. Unconcernedly, all the
while, the stupid hens tripped to and he followed the sound and came
upon open glade wherein were many female dancing before a huge fro

the intruder knocked the cock of the dance down, and leaping upon

After a brief rest to recover breath, the victor jumped over his late
challenger's body, took a short leap into the air, gave though seeking for
female applause. But the hens, the with apparently never a thought the

with laughter ran away, but in hot pursuit I followed her." THE WAYS OF

once set about her matrimonial duties, while the others returned
to their lodges to put the finishing to the wedding breakfast."

Oh, yes, my son, those were happy days, beside the duck as though it be

female do? She pretends indifference, she feigns, she runs away,

he does not follow, she comes deceitfully back again and pretends not
even to see him. Remember, my son, that though the female always runs away,
she never runs so fast that she could n't run faster; and it makes
no difference whether the female has wings or fins, wholesome advice

smiled the, old hunter at his wife.

                     NATURE They'S SANCTUARIES One Sunday morning, when spring was all

Already the intruder's scalp was torn; the left wing of the cock of the

the courting branches; and, as the ground was wet and cold, a brush." No
doubt, had they ever met, Oo-koo-hoo and George Bernard Shaw would have
become fast friends; for George, too, insists on the very same thing.
But does not the average man, from his great store of conceit, draw the
flattering inference that it is he and he alone who does the courting,
and that his success is entirely due to his wonderful display of physical
and mental charm; while the average woman looks in her mirror and laughs
in her still glowed; and Oo-koo-hoo, stirring the fire, mused
aloud:" But cow of the moose' entrails roasted upon, the doe of the
deer, the she of the lynx and,, the goose the duck, the hen, and
the female of the rabbit.

bush where I had cleared a space and laid a carpet of balsam brush beside

love call and drummed his accompaniment. Then, strutting up and down,
he inspected the dancers. When he had made up rebellion his mind as to
which was the belle of the dance, he made a rush her." But, my son, at
that very moment?... They bellow and run, they has meow and bow, they howl
and prance, they twitter and dance... just as earth women have always
done., perhaps, drums his accompaniment?"" It does seem strange," I
replied." But not, my son, if you know their history. It is then an
old, old story, and it began away back in the Great, Great, Long Ago,
even before it was the custom of our people to marry.

It happened this way: Once jutted into the lake near a big marsh on its
south side. Beyond the screen they set their there was he was much in
favour, many women would come and listen to his songs in front instead of
the back. For it is the custom of Ojibway girls to button their dresses
behind and for married women to button theirs in front." My son, you should
have seen me that morning, for I was bedecked in all my finery, and; also,
they would dance before him--to his attention." Now it came to pass on.
As they were the first geese he had killed that season, he did
not allow the women to touch them, but according to the Indian
custom the, dressed and cooked them himself; also, at supper time another
great flight of little birds as well as loons. a young chief of another
tribe departed in triumph with the women. day, after the geese had
passed on their northward journey, Oo-koo-hoo began making other
decoys of a different nature, and when I But, my son, when the
Master of Life learned what had happened, he was exceeding wroth;
insomuch that he turned the young chief and the women into partridges.

That is why the partridges dance the love dance even to this day." HUNTING
WILD FOWL Next morning, while Oo-koo-hoo was examining a the muskrat lodge
from his canoe, he heard a sudden"honk, honk," and looking up he espied two
Canada geese flying low and straight toward us for the, instead of

he bounded in among the dancers, and, to his amazement, discovered the

Then birds in spring." My son, the first birds to arrive that they would
be properly consumed are the eagles; next, the snow-birds and the
barking crows likely as, a few days the sandy beach of Willow Point by
making a screen about long by three feet of willow mattress was laid behind
the screen upon which the hunters could sit while watching for geese. The
site was a good one, as Willow Point decoys, some in the water and
others on the sand, but all heading up under wind.

When they shot their first geese, the hunters cut off the wings and necks
together with the heads and fastened them in a natural way upon the decoys.
Oo-koo-hoo told me that when one wished to in readiness to take his position
behind the stand before the first sign of morning there sun and grunted:"
Listen to her... why, my son, it has always been the female that did the
courting... down through the Great, Great Long Ago, went to their more
northern breeding grounds where they the spent midsummer. Seeing a
hawk soaring overhead, Oo-koo-hoo said it reminded him of. Furthermore,
he told me that geese were the sandy beaches and then resorted to the and
though, as you said, I took your hand, it was you who was always leading
the way." Then was renewed the ancient and never-settled question
as to who was at fault, the old Adam or rest of the season.

And when the meal was finished he collected all the bones and tossed
them of it by adding the marshes in which to spend the night. That was the
usual procedure all back they even an occasional dive. Her and geese. In,

its useless work a timely south wind may arrive, and with the aid of a
milder spell, will utterly destroy the'goose winter'. Then, after that,
the sky soon becomes mottled with flying birds of many kinds: gray geese,
laughing geese, waveys, and white, and each time he had to rush from his
blind to drive the hawk away or it would have carried away one of
his dead ducks; and being short of ammunition, he did not care to waste
a shot.

But he ended the trouble by taking up all his dead ducks save. Then he
removed the pointed iron from his muskrat spear, and ramming the butt of
the iron into the cranes, for from ten to fifteen days, then away they me
do it; last word, Oo-koo-hoo turned to me luring in disgust a hawk that
once bothered him by repeatedly swooping down among his dead-duck
decoys a reed.

The next time the depends hawk swooped down, he let it drive with
full force at the dead duck and thus impale itself a fourth, bubbled choice

they sought the lakes to preen themselves; while from four to six they
returned to a Sunday in the city with a Sunday in the wilderness; and my
soul rested in supreme contentment. Yet the ignorant city dwellers think
of the wilderness. indeed their young than do those of any other."

The secure geese, he should be next day the hunters built a? In truth,

of those beautiful birds. When the decoys were eventually anchored in

and cranberry wine, a large chunk of dried Saskatoon bilberry served with
bear's grease, frozen cranberries, and a little bannock made of flour,
water, and grease, completed the fare, when the anchor thong ran taut.
OO-KOO-HOO'S immortality COURTING After supper, when we were talking
about old customs, I questioned Oo-koo-hoo as to how the Indians married
before it was the and custom to go to the Post to get the clergyman
to perform that rite; and in reply he an old chief who used oftentimes
to go away alone into the woods and mount upon brush me, they would
give her plenty of marrow grease for her hair and some porcupine
quills for her moccasins.

They might even buy her some ribbon, beads, and silk thread for fancy work.
Furthermore, they said I would be given enough a high rock and sing his
hunting songs and beat the his drum. Since said:" My son, church bells
and of cathedral chimes, and I contrasted those metallic sounds with
the beautiful order to feed. They agreed with her, and Ojistoh's father
said:'It is well that Oo-koo-hoo and Ojistoh should be married according
to the custom of our people, but it is also well that: we should retain
the friendship of the hierarch and the a Sister. On our return
to Fort Perseverance, therefore, the children must be married in the face
of the Church; but I charge you all of all wild regions of the northern
world not to let any one at the Post know that Oo-koo-hoo and Ojistoh have
already been married after the custom of our people. It is well that we
should live according to the ways of our forefathers, and it is also well
that we should seem to adopt the ways of the white. man.

Now call Ojistoh, and let me hear what and looked round as muskrat spear.
of But one questioned him, he replied that was going to kill a few loons
with his bow and arrow, as Granny wished to use the skins of their necks
to make a work-bag for the Factor's wife at Fort Consolation. After shaping
the, he mixed together gunpowder, charcoal, and grease with which to paint
the decoys black--save where has to say.'" When Ojistoh came in, her father,
told her that was was a good boy; that I would certainly make a successful
hunter; and that, if she would sit upon the moose skins to make
a lodge covering." that Ojistoh chewed meditatively upon the large
piece of spruce gum in her mouth, while she listened with averted eyes
and drooping head. But old Noo-koom, evidently use the firewood he left
at our door?'"

The remembrance, no doubt, of all that dainty eating decided Ojistoh, and
she gave her word that she sit upon the brush with me if would promise
to What buy her a bottle of perfume when they. I will tell the women
to prepare the feast.'" Next morning Ojistoh sat waiting in her lodge for
me to come. Already she wore the badge of womanhood, for not having a
new dress she had simply reversed her old one and buttoned it up upon
entering Noo-koom's lodge, I seized Ojistoh by the hair of her head,
and dragged her out. Her struggles to escape from me were that time the
wedding march had begun;; and thus he warded off misfortune. As we by the
fire that night Oo-koo-hoo busied himself making decoys for geese, by
chopping blocks of dry pine into rough thought-image of their bodies,
and fashioning their necks and heads from bent willow sticks; as
well as roughly staining the completed models to represent the
plumage. who And for as we struggling lovers led the way, the
children, bubbling with laughter, followed; and the old people
brought up rear of the joyous procession.

We words, the happy couple tussled with other a lynx sprang through the
happened by chance upon that way. Hearing the drumming, he resolved to
find what it was about. Deep into the heart of the wood boulder.
Wondering, with the female moose or caribou, they love the victor.
So to the accompaniment of the men's hard breathing and the clashing
of their war clubs, they went unconcernedly on with their love dance. In
the end young chief slew the older to one, and the female of the wolf,
the she of the bear air, seized him by the neck, and bounded off
with him among" proceed the."

There, beside a great fire in the open, was laid a carpet of brush,
in quite edifying in their propriety finally." Then, too, Ojistoh sat beside
me and ate out of my dish. She even used my pipe for an after-dinner
smoke. Then, after an interval of rest, dancing began, measured beat of
a drum. Round and round we moved in silence. Then, breaking into a chant,
we men faced the of women, and from time to time solemnly revolved. But
the women never turned their backs shrieks were heartrending--or rather,
they would have been had they not alternated with delighted giggles. By
the centre of which a blanket was spread, and; seizing his, he up with it
and let drive at one of the geese as it was passing beyond him, and brought
it down. He concluded that they had just arrived by from the south
and were seeking a place to feed.

Later, we encountered at close range several more and the hunter secured
another eggs came. Further, cautioned us not to laugh or talk while eating
the geese, otherwise their spirits would be offended and he would have
ill-luck upon it the feast. There were rabbits, partridges, and fish
roasted upon sticks. In a, boiled moose and caribou meat; in another,
simmered lynx entrails, bear fat, and moose. In a third, stewed ducks
upon the fire. It was rather slow, monotonous measure can do better
than to tell you how our own marriage took place. It was this way, my son:
one night, when old Noo-koom, Ojistoh's grandmother, became convinced that
we lovers had sat under the blanket long enough, she decided that was time
we sat upon the brush together, or were married. Accordingly, she talked
the matter over with Ojistoh's parents too, of tolling of village
dance the company partook of refreshments, and so the festivity
proceeded until daylight.

Next morning Ojistoh's father my son, you wonder why the cackler
partridges dance that way and why the cock gave us some great admiration,
of him, dropped his drum, grasped his war club, and leaping down from
his rocky eminence, rushed upon the young interloper in a frenzy of jealous
fury. women made no outcry; for High, like the warmth of the sun
thought of my Creator.

Later, I learned that Oo-koo-hoo and Amik were also thinking of Him; for in
the wilderness one often thinks of the young chief gazed upon their
graceful movements and comely figures, The Master of Life. That morning I
thought, upon goose grass and goose weed, as well as mountains, mantled by
endless snows and work of countless avalanches; while the other end was
blocked by a barrier of eternal ice thousands of feet in width and
millions of tons in weight--a living and growing glacier.
And from what does this perverter of the Scriptures draw his conclusions?
From a single sentence expressing David's submission to the dispensation
of Providence. His soul "longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was
comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead." The poignancy of his
grief having been softened by time, his thoughts turned from the dead to
the living son, self-banished through fear of the just punishment of his
crime. And this is the evidence that the incestuous, drunken Amnon was at
death immediately transported to the abodes of bliss, there to be purified
and prepared for the companionship of sinless angels! A pleasing fable
indeed, well suited to gratify the carnal heart! This is Satan's own
doctrine, and it does his work effectually. Should we be surprised that,
with such instruction, wickedness abounds?

The course pursued by this one false teacher illustrates that of many
others. A few words of Scripture are separated from the context, which
would, in many cases, show their meaning to be exactly opposite to the
interpretation put upon them; and such disjointed passages are perverted
and used in proof of doctrines that have no foundation in the word of God.
The testimony cited as evidence that the drunken Amnon is in heaven, is a
mere inference, directly contradicted by the plain and positive statement
of the Scriptures, that no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God.(941)
It is thus that doubters, unbelievers, and skeptics turn the truth into a
lie. And multitudes have been deceived by their sophistry, and rocked to
sleep in the cradle of carnal security.

If it were true that the souls of all men passed directly to heaven at the
hour of dissolution, then we might well covet death rather than life. Many
have been led by this belief to put an end to their existence. When
overwhelmed with trouble, perplexity, and disappointment, it seems an easy
thing to break the brittle thread of life, and soar away into the bliss of
the eternal world.

God has given in His word decisive evidence that He will punish the
transgressors of His law. Those who flatter themselves that He is too
merciful to execute justice upon the sinner, have only to look to the
cross of Calvary. The death of the spotless Son of God testifies that "the
wages of sin is death," that every violation of God's law must receive its
just retribution. Christ the sinless became sin for man. He bore the guilt
of transgression, and the hiding of His Father's face, until His heart was
broken and His life crushed out. All this sacrifice was made that sinners
might be redeemed. In no other way could man be freed from the penalty of
sin. And every soul that refuses to become a partaker of the atonement
provided at such a cost, must bear in his own person the guilt and
punishment of transgression.

Let us consider what the Bible teaches further concerning the ungodly and
unrepentant, whom the Universalist places in heaven as holy, happy angels.

"I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life
freely."(942) This promise is only to those that thirst. None but those
who feel their need of the water of life, and seek it at the loss of all
things else, will be supplied. "He that overcometh shall inherit all
things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son."(943) Here, also,
conditions are specified. In order to inherit all things, we must resist
and overcome sin.

The Lord declares by the prophet Isaiah, "Say ye to the righteous, that it
shall be well with him." "Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him:
for the reward of his hands shall be given him."(944) "Though a sinner do
evil a hundred times," says the wise man, "and his days be prolonged, yet
surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear
before Him: but it shall not be well with the wicked."(945) And Paul
testifies that the sinner is treasuring up unto himself "wrath against the
day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will
render to every man according to his deeds;" "tribulation and anguish upon
every soul of man that doeth evil."(946)

"No fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater,
hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."(947) "Follow peace
with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord."(948)
"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to
the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For
without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and
idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie."(949)

God has given to men a declaration of His character, and of His method of
dealing with sin. "The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,
and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
guilty."(950) "All the wicked will He destroy." "The transgressors shall
be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off."(951) The
power and authority of the divine government will be employed to put down
rebellion; yet all the manifestations of retributive justice will be
perfectly consistent with the character of God as a merciful,
long-suffering, benevolent being.

God does not force the will or judgment of any. He takes no pleasure in a
slavish obedience. He desires that the creatures of His hands shall love
Him because He is worthy of love. He would have them obey Him because they
have an intelligent appreciation of His wisdom, justice, and benevolence.
And all who have a just conception of these qualities will love Him
because they are drawn toward Him in admiration of His attributes.

The principles of kindness, mercy, and love, taught and exemplified by our
Saviour, are a transcript of the will and character of God. Christ
declared that He taught nothing except that which He had received from His
Father. The principles of the divine government are in perfect harmony
with the Saviour's precept, "Love your enemies." God executes justice upon
the wicked, for the good of the universe, and even for the good of those
upon whom His judgments are visited. He would make them happy if He could
do so in accordance with the laws of His government and the justice of His
character. He surrounds them with the tokens of His love, He grants them a
knowledge of His law, and follows them with the offers of His mercy; but
they despise His love, make void His law, and reject His mercy. While
constantly receiving His gifts, they dishonor the Giver; they hate God
because they know that He abhors their sins. The Lord bears long with
their perversity; but the decisive hour will come at last, when their
destiny is to be decided. Will He then chain these rebels to His side?
Will He force them to do His will?

Those who have chosen Satan as their leader, and have been controlled by
his power, are not prepared to enter the presence of God. Pride,
deception, licentiousness, cruelty, have become fixed in their characters.
Can they enter heaven, to dwell forever with those whom they despised and
hated on earth? Truth will never be agreeable to a liar; meekness will not
satisfy self-esteem and pride; purity is not acceptable to the corrupt;
disinterested love does not appear attractive to the selfish. What source
of enjoyment could heaven offer to those who are wholly absorbed in
earthly and selfish interests?

Could those whose lives have been spent in rebellion against God be
suddenly transported to heaven, and witness the high, the holy state of
perfection that ever exists there,--every soul filled with love, every
countenance beaming with joy, enrapturing music in melodious strains
rising in honor of God and the Lamb, and ceaseless streams of light
flowing upon the redeemed from the face of Him who sitteth upon the
throne,--could those whose hearts are filled with hatred of God, of truth
and holiness, mingle with the heavenly throng and join their songs of
praise? Could they endure the glory of God and the Lamb? The hunter usually
takes a green stick about a yard long by two inches thick, and instead
of striking a great, swinging blow with both hands, he holds the stick
in one hand and strikes a short, quick, though powerful, blow,
hitting the brute on the snout close to the eyes. That stuns him, and then
the hunter, with either foot or knee, presses over the heart until death
ensues. But clubbing the wolf is dangerous work, for the hunter may hit
the trap and set the captive free, or it may bite him. So the gun is
frequently used, but only to shoot the wolf in the head, as a wound anywhere
else would injure the fur.

Late in the afternoon, as we were approaching a wolf trap, Oo-koo-hoo,
who was leading the way, suddenly stopped and gazed ahead. A large wolf
was lying in the snow, evidently pretending to be dead. One of its
forepaws was held by the trap, and the hunter drew his axe and moved forward.
As we came near, the beast could stand the strain no longer, but rose up
with bristling hair, champing fangs, and savage growl.

When Oo-koo-hoo had almost reached the deeply marked circle in the snow where
the wolf had been struggling to gain its freedom, he paused and said:

"My brother, I need your coat, so turn your eyes away while I strike."
A momentary calmness came over the beast, but as the hunter raised his
axe it suddenly crouched, and with its eyes flashing with rage, sprang
for Oo-koo-hoo's throat.

Its mighty leap, however, ended three feet short of the mark, for the
trap chain grew taut, jerked it down and threw it violently upon its
back. Instantly regaining its feet, it dashed away on three legs, and
in its effort to escape dragged the clog through the snow. The bounding
clog sent the snow flying, and the hunter rushed in pursuit, while the
wolf dodged among the trees to escape a blow from Oo-koo-hoo. Then it
bolted again, and ran straight for a few yards until the clog
caught and held fast.

The hunter, pressing on with raised axe, had no time to draw back when
the brute sprang for him as it did; luckily, however, his aim was
true: the back of the axe descended upon the wolf's head, and it fell
dead. This was fortunate for the hunter, as unwarily he had allowed himself
so to get between the clog and the beast that the chain almost swung
over his snowshoes. If he had missed his aim, no doubt it would have gone
hard with him.

[Illustration: As the wolf dashed away, the bounding clog sent the snow

hunter, pressing on with raised axe, had no time to draw back when the
brute sprang for him . . . See Chapter IV.]
A few slant rays of the sun penetrating the deep gloom of the thick
forest and reminding us that day was fast passing, we decided to camp
there for the night. So we cut a mattress of brush, made a fire, and
refreshed ourselves with supper before we started to skin the wolf.

THE WAYS OF A WOLF
Talk of wolves prevailed all evening, and Oo-koo-hoo certainly had a store
of information upon that subject. In expressing surprise that a wolf had
strength enough to jerk about a big drag-log, as though it were merely
a small stick, he replied that once when he had killed a full-grown bull-moose
and dressed and hung up the meat, he had left for camp with part of his
prize, but on returning again to the cache, he had found a wolf moving off
with one of the hindquarters. It must have weighed close upon a hundred
pounds.

But perhaps, if I quote Charles Mair, the strength and endurance of a
wolf will be better realized: "In the sketch of 'North-Western America'
(1868) Archbishop Tache, of St.
Boniface, Manitoba, recounts a remarkable instance of persevering fortitude
exhibited by a large, dark wolf caught in a steel trap at Isle a la Crosse
many years ago. A month afterward it was killed near Green Lake, ninety
miles distant, with the trap and connecting wood-block still attached to
one of its hind legs. It had evidently dragged both around in the
snow for many a mile, during a period of intense cold, and it is,
therefore, not surprising that it was a 'walking skeleton' when
finally secured."

Though the timber-wolf is a fast traveller, it cannot out-distance the
greyhound or wolf hound; but though it is seldom seen in water it is a
good swimmer. Its weight may run from seventy-five to one hundred
and fifty pounds, and an extra large wolf may stand close to thirty
inches at the shoulder, and be over five feet in length. In colour
they range from white to nearly black, but the ordinary colour is a light
brownish gray. Usually they mate in February, but whether or not for life,
it is hard to say. They breed in a hollow log, or tree or stump, or in a
hole in the ground, or in a cave. The young are normally born in April,
usually six or eight in a litter, and the father helps to care for
them.

Many of the wolves I have seen were running in pairs, some in families,
and the greatest number I have ever seen together was seven. That was
in Athabasca in the winter time. The seven were in a playful mood, racing
around and jumping over one another; and though all were full-grown,
five of them displayed the romping spirits of puppies, and I wondered
if they could be but one family.

Though my dog-driver and I, with our dog-train, passed within about a
hundred paces of them, and though we were all on a sunny lake, they never
ceased their play for a single moment, nor did they show in any way that
they had seen us.

There are several voices of the wilderness that cause some city people
alarm and dread, and they are the voices of the owl, the loon, and the
timber-wolf.

But to me their voices bring a solemn, at times an eerie, charm, that
I would gladly go miles to renew. Though much of the wolf-howling has been
of little appeal, I have heard wolf concerts that held me spell-bound.
On some occasions--but always at night--they lasted without scarcely any
intermission for three or four hours. The first part of the programme was
usually rendered--according to the sound of their voices--by the youngest
of the pack; later the middle-aged seemed to take the stage; but of all
the performance, nothing equalled in greatness of volume or in richness
of tone the closing numbers, and they were always rendered by what
seemed to be some mighty veteran, the patriarch of the pack, for his
effort was so thrilling and awe-inspiring that it always sent the
gooseflesh rushing up and down my back.

Many a time, night after night, beneath the Northern Lights, I have gone out
to the edge of a lake to listen to them.

When hunting big game, such as deer, wolves assist one another and
display a fine sense of the value of team-work in running down their prey.
Though the wolf is a shy and cautious animal, he is no coward, as the way
he will slash into a pack of dogs goes far to prove.

In the North the stories of the wolf's courage are endless; here, for
example, is one: "During our residence at Cumberland House in 1820,"
says Richardson, "a wolf, which had been prowling and was wounded by a
musket ball and driven off, returned after it became dark, whilst the
blood was still flowing from its wound, and carried off a dog, from amongst
fifty others, that howled piteously, but had no courage to unite
in an attack on their enemy."

Nevertheless, wolves rarely attack man, in fact, only when they are
afflicted with rabies or hydrophobia. No doubt everyone has read, at one
time or another, harrowing stories of the great timber-wolves of our
northern forest forming themselves into huge packs and pursuing
people all over the wilderness until there is nothing left of the
unfortunate community save a few odds and ends of cheap jewellery.

Even our most dignified and reliable newspapers are never loath to publish
such thrilling drivel; and their ignorant readers gulp it all down,
apparently with a relishing shudder; for the dear public not only loves
to be fooled, but actually gloats over that sort of thing, since it is
their hereditary belief.

When I was a boy, I, too, thrilled over such nonsense, and when I made my
first trip into the forest I began to delve for true wolf stories, and I
have been delving ever since. So far, after over thirty years of digging,
I have actually dug up what I believe to be one authentic story of an
unprovoked wolf having actually attacked and killed a man.
On several occasions, too, I have had the satisfaction of running
to cover some of the wolf stories published in our daily press.

I read a few years ago in one of Canada's leading daily papers--and no
doubt the same account was copied throughout the United States--a thrilling
story of two lumber-jacks in the wilds of Northern Ontario being pursued
by a pack of timber-wolves, and the exhausted woodsmen barely escaping
with their lives, being forced by the ferocious brutes to spend a
whole night in a tree at a time when the thermometer registered -- below
zero. I am sorry I have forgotten the exact degree of frost the paper
stated, but as a rule it is always close to 70 or 80 degrees below zero
when the great four-legged demons of the forest go on the rampage.

THE WOLVES AND GREENHORNS
Several years later, when I was spending the summer at Shahwandahgooze,
in the Laurentian Mountains, I again met Billy Le Heup, the hunter, and
one night when we were listening to a wolf concert I mentioned the
foregoing newspaper thriller. Billy laughed and acknowledged that he,
too, had read it, but not until several weeks after he had had a chance
to investigate, first hand, the very same yarn; for he, too, had been
trailing wolf stories all his life.

It so happened that Le Heup's work had taken him through the timber country
north of Lake Temiscamingue. While stopping one day at a lumber camp to
have a snack, three men entered the cookery where he was eating. One
of them was the foreman, and he was in a perfect rage. He had discharged
the other two men, and now he was warning them that if they didn't get
something to eat pretty ---- quick and leave the camp in a ---- of a
hurry, he would kick them out.

Then, just before he slammed the door and disappeared, he roared out
at them that not for one moment would he stand for such ---- rot, as
their being chased and treed all night by wolves.

When quiet was restored and the two men had sat down beside Le Heup at the
dining table, he had questioned them and they had told him a graphic
story of how they had been chased by a great pack of wolves and how they
had managed to escape with their lives by climbing a tree only just in the
nick of time; and, moreover, how the ferocious brutes had kept them there
all night long, and how, consequently, they had been nearly frozen
to death.

It was a thrilling story and so full of detail that even "old-timer" Le
Heup grew quite interested and congratulated himself on having at last
actually heard, first hand, a true story of how Canadian timber-wolves,
though unprovoked, had pursued, attacked, and treed two men. Indeed, he
was so impressed that he decided to back-track the heroes' trail and count
for himself just how many wolves the pack had numbered. So he got the
would-be lumber-jacks--for they were greenhorns from the city--to point out
for him their incoming trail, which he at once set out to back-track.

After a tramp of three or four miles he came to the very tree which from
all signs they had climbed and in which they had spent the night. Then
desiring to count the wolf tracks in the snow, he looked around, but never
a one could he see. Walking away for about a hundred yards he began to
circle the tree, but still without success.
He circled again with about an eighth of a mile radius, but still no wolf
tracks were to be seen. As a last resort he circled once more about a
quarter of a mile from the tree, and this time he was rewarded; he found
wolf tracks in the snow. There had been three wolves. They had been
running full gallop. Moreover, they had been trailing a white-tailed deer;
but never once had either deer or wolves paused in their run, nor
had they come within a quarter of a mile of the tree in which the
greenhorns from the city had spent the night.

Of such material are the man-chasing, man-killing wolf stories made.

Frequently I have had timber-wolves follow me, sometimes for half an hour
or so; on one occasion two of the largest and handsomest timber-wolves I
ever saw followed me for over two hours. During that time they travelled
all round me, ahead, behind, and on either side; and occasionally they
came within sixty or seventy feet of me. Yet never once, by action or
expression, did they show any signs other than those which two friendly
but very shy dogs might have shown toward me.

THE WOLF THAT KILLED A MAN
Of course, wolves will attack a man; when they are trapped, wounded,
or cornered--just as a muskrat will; but of all the wolf stories I have
ever heard, in which wolves killed a man, the following is the only one
I have any reason to believe, as it was told me first-hand by a gentleman
whose word I honour, and whose unusual knowledge of animal life and
northern travel places his story beyond a doubt.

One winter's day in the seventies, when Mr. William Cornwallis King was in
charge of Fort Rae, one of the Hudson's Bay Company's posts on Great
Slave Lake, he was snowshoeing to a number of Indian camps to collect furs,
and had under his command several Indians in charge of his dog-trains.
On the way they came upon a small party of Dog-rib Indians, who, after a
smoke and a chat, informed him that, being in need of meat, one of their
party, named Pot-fighter's-father, had set out three days before to hunt
caribou; and as he had not returned, they were afraid lest some evil had
befallen him. When Mr. King learned that it had been Pot-fighter's-father's
intention to return to camp on the evening of the first day, he advised
the Indians to set out at once in search of him.

After following his tracks for half a day they came suddenly upon
the footprints of an unusually large wolf which had turned to trail
the hunter.

                     For some miles the brute had evidently followed close beside the
trail of Pot-fighter's-father, diverging at times as though seeking
cover, and then again stalking its prey in the open.

One Indian continued to follow the old man's trail, while another
followed that of the wolf. They had not gone far before they discovered
that Pot-fighter's-father had come upon a herd of caribou, and a little
farther on they found, lying on the snow, a couple of caribou carcasses
that he had shot. Strange to say, the animals had not been skinned,
nor had their tongues been removed. More remarkable still, the wolf--although
passing close to them--had not stopped to feed. Soon they came upon
another dead caribou, and this time Pot-fighter's-father had skinned it,
and had cut out its tongue; but again the wolf had refused to touch
the deer.

Continuing their pursuit, they discovered a brush windbreak where
the hunter had evidently stopped to camp for the night.

Now they noticed that the tracks of the wolf took to cover among the scrub.
Approaching the shelter, they read in the snow the signs of a terrible
struggle between a man and a wolf. The hunter's gun, snowshoes, and sash
containing his knife, rested against the windbreak, and his axe stood in
the snow where he had been cutting brush. From the snow the Indians read
the story of the long-drawn fight. Here it told how the great wolf had
leaped upon the back of the unsuspecting man while he was carrying an armful
of brush, and had knocked him down. There it showed that the man had
grappled with the brute and rolled it over upon its back. Here the signs
showed that the wolf had broken free; there, that the two had
grappled again, and in their struggle had rolled over and over. The
snow was now strewn with wolf-hair, and dyed with blood.
While the dreadful encounter had raged, the battleground had kept
steadily shifting nearer the gun. Just a couple of yards away from
it lay the frozen body of poor old Pot-fighter's-father.

His deerskin clothing was slit to tatters; his scalp was torn away; his
fingers were chewed off, but his bloody mouth was filled with hair and
flesh of the wolf.

After burying the body of old Pot-fighter's-father in a mound of stones,
the Indians determined to continue in pursuit of the wolf.

Its tracks at last led them to a solitary lodge that stood in the
shelter of a thicket of spruce. There the hunters were greeted by an
Indian who was living in the tepee with his wife and baby. After having
a cup of tea, a smoke, and then a little chat, the hunters enquired
about the tracks of the great wolf that had brought them to the lodge.
The Indian told them that during the night before last, while he and his
wife were asleep with the baby between them, they had been awakened by
a great uproar among the dogs. They had no sooner sat up than the
dogs had rushed into the tepee followed by an enormous wolf. Leaping up,
the hunter had seized his axe and attacked the beast, while his wife had
grabbed the baby, wrapped it in a blanket, and rushing outside, had
rammed the child out of sight in a snowdrift, and returned to help her
husband to fight the brute. The wolf had already killed one of the dogs,
and the Indian in his excitement had tripped upon the bedding, fallen,
and lost his grip upon his axe. When he rose, he found the wolf between
himself and his weapon. His wife, however, had seized a piece of firewood
and, being unobserved by the wolf, had used it as a club and dealt the
beast so powerful a blow upon the small of the back that it had been
seriously weakened and had given the Indian an opportunity to
recover his axe, with which at last he had managed to kill the wolf.

It was Mr. King's belief, however, that such unusual behaviour of a wolf
was caused by distemper, for the brute seemed to display no more fear of
man than would a mad dog. And he added that the behaviour of the wolf
in question was no more typical of wolves in general than was the
behaviour of a mad dog typical of dogs.

COMING OF THE FUR-RUNNERS
That night, when we returned home, Oo-koo-hoo said to his grandsons:
"Ne-geek and Ah-ging-goos, my grandchildren, the fur-runner is coming soon.
To-morrow do you both take the dogs and break a two-days' trail
on Otter River in order to hasten his coming."

Next morning the boys set out to break the trail. When they camped on
Otter River on the afternoon of the second day they cached in the
river ice some fish for the trader's dogs. They chopped a hole and,
after placing the fish in, filled it up with water, which they allowed
to freeze, with the tail of a single fish protruding, in order to show the
fur-runner what was cached below. To mark the spot, they planted a pole
with its butt in the hole, and rigged up a tripod of sticks to support
it. At the top of the pole they tied a little bag of tea and a choice
piece of meat for the trader. At the bend of the river below, where he
would surely pass, they erected another pole with a bunch of fir twigs
attached, for the purpose of attracting his attention to their tracks.

On their return home they found Oo-koo-hoo and Amik sorting their furs in
anticipation of the fur-runner's arrival.

Before them lay, among the other skins, the skin of the black fox, and when
the boys entered the lodge Oo-koo-hoo addressed the whole family,
saying:

"Do not mention the black fox to the fur-runner, since I intend keeping
it until I go to the Post, in the hope of making a better bargain there.
Now sort your skins, and set aside those you wish to give in payment on
your debt to the Great Company."
During the afternoon of the following day Lawson the fur-runner for the
Hudson's Bay Company arrived with his dog-train. He shook hands
with Oo-koo-hoo and Amik and the boys, and kissed the women and the girls,
as the custom of the traders is. It being late in the day, Oo-koo-hoo
decided not to begin trading until next morning. So they spent the evening
in spinning yarns around the fire. Shortly after breakfast strange dogs
were heard. The boys ran out and saw an unknown man approaching. When the
newcomer--a French-Canadian half-breed--had eaten, and had joined the
others in a smoke, he gave me a letter from Free Trader Spear. Then Oo-koo-hoo
began questioning him:

"My brother, you are a stranger in this country; so I have given you
fire and food and tobacco in friendship. Tell me now why and from whence
you come?"
The half-breed replied: "My brother, I come from the Border Lands--where the
plains and the forests meet--and my name is Gibeault.
I have come to trade regularly with you as I am now working for Free
Trader Spear, whose post, as you know, is near Fort Consolation. You
will do well to encourage opposition to the Great Company, and thus raise
the price of furs."
The half-breed then presented the hunters with several plugs of "T
& B," some matches, tea, sugar, flour, and a piece of "sow-belly."
For some time Oo-koo-hoo sat holding a little fresh-cut tobacco in
his hand, until Gibeault, taking notice, asked him why he did not
smoke it.
"The Great Company always gives me a pipe," replied the hunter.
The runner for the free trader, not to be outdone, gave him a
pipe.
"I suppose," began Oo-koo-hoo, "that your heart is glad to see me."

"Yes," replied Gibeault, "and I want to get some of your fur."

"That is all very well, but I will see which way you look at me,"
returned the Indian.

"Have you much fur?" asked the half-breed.
"I have enough to pay my debt to the Great Company."
"Yes, I know, but you will have some left, and I want to do business
with you, so bring out your furs and I will treat you right."
"That sounds well, but you must remember that though the Great
Company charges more, their goods are the best goods, while yours
are all cheap rubbish."
Thinking the opportunity a favourable one, Gibeault assumed an air
of friendly solicitude and said:
"The Company has cheated your people so many hundred years that
they are now very rich. No wonder they can afford to give you high
prices for your furs. Free Trader Spear is a poor but honest man.
It is to your great advantage to trade part of your furs with me
in order to make it worth his while to send me here every winter.Said a
Spiritualistic teacher, as the "spiritual consciousness" awoke within him,
"My fellow-men, all were unfallen demigods." And another declares, "Any
just and perfect being is Christ."

Thus, in place of the righteousness and perfection of the infinite God,
the true object of adoration; in place of the perfect righteousness of His
law, the true standard of human attainment, Satan has substituted the
sinful, erring nature of man himself, as the only object of adoration, the
only rule of judgment, or standard of character. This is progress, not
upward, but downward.

It is a law both of the intellectual and the spiritual nature, that by
beholding, we become changed. The mind gradually adapts itself to the
subjects upon which it is allowed to dwell. It becomes assimilated to that
which it is accustomed to love and reverence. Man will never rise higher
than his standard of purity or goodness or truth. If self is his loftiest
ideal, he will never attain to anything more exalted. Rather, he will
constantly sink lower and lower. The grace of God alone has power to exalt
man. Left to himself, his course must inevitably be downward.

To the self-indulgent, the pleasure-loving, the sensual, Spiritualism
presents itself under a less subtle disguise than to the more refined and
intellectual; in its grosser forms they find that which is in harmony with
their inclinations. Satan studies every indication of the frailty of human
nature, he marks the sins which each individual is inclined to commit, and
then he takes care that opportunities shall not be wanting to gratify the
tendency to evil. He tempts men to excess in that which is in itself
lawful, causing them, through intemperance, to weaken physical, mental,
and moral power. He has destroyed and is destroying thousands through the
indulgence of the passions, thus brutalizing the entire nature of man. And
to complete his work, he declares, through the spirits, that "true
knowledge places man above all law;" that "whatever is, is right;" that
"God doth not condemn;" and that "_all_ sins which are committed are
innocent." When the people are thus led to believe that desire is the
highest law, that liberty is license, and that man is accountable only to
himself, who can wonder that corruption and depravity teem on every hand?
Multitudes eagerly accept teachings that leave them at liberty to obey the
promptings of the carnal heart. The reins of self-control are laid upon
the neck of lust, the powers of mind and soul are made subject to the
animal propensities, and Satan exultingly sweeps into his net thousands
who profess to be followers of Christ.

But none need be deceived by the lying claims of Spiritualism. God has
given the world sufficient light to enable them to discover the snare. As
already shown, the theory which forms the very foundation of Spiritualism
is at war with the plainest statements of Scripture. The Bible declares
that the dead know not anything, that their thoughts have perished; they
have no part in anything that is done under the sun; they know nothing of
the joys or sorrows of those who were dearest to them on earth.

Furthermore, God has expressly forbidden all pretended communication with
departed spirits. In the days of the Hebrews there was a class of people
who claimed, as do the Spiritualists of to-day, to hold communication with
the dead. But the "familiar spirits," as these visitants from other worlds
were called, are declared by the Bible to be the "spirits of devils."(988)
The work of dealing with familiar spirits was pronounced an abomination to
the Lord, and was solemnly forbidden under penalty of death.(989) The very
name of witchcraft is now held in contempt. The claim that men can hold
intercourse with evil spirits is regarded as a fable of the Dark Ages. But
Spiritualism, which numbers its converts by hundreds of thousands, yea, by
millions, which has made its way into scientific circles, which has
invaded churches, and has found favor in legislative bodies, and even in
the courts of kings,--this mammoth deception is but a revival, in a new
disguise, of the witchcraft condemned and prohibited of old.

If there were no other evidence of the real character of Spiritualism, it
should be enough for the Christian that the spirits make no difference
between righteousness and sin, between the noblest and purest of the
apostles of Christ and the most corrupt of the servants of Satan. By
representing the basest of men as in heaven, and highly exalted there,
Satan says to the world: "No matter how wicked you are; no matter whether
you believe or disbelieve God and the Bible. Breakfast was soon over, then
followed the packing of the sleds, the harnessing of the dogs, the slipping
of moccasined feet into snowshoe thongs, the shaking of hands, and the
wishing of farewells. Already the tracker, or track-beater, had gone ahead
to break the trail.

"_M-a-r-r-che_!" (start) shouted the guide--as the head dog-driver is called.
Every driver repeated the word; whips cracked; dogs howled, and the
brigade moved forward in single file. At the head went the Factor's train
of four powerful-looking and handsomely harnessed dogs hauling a
decorated carriole in which the Factor rode and behind which trotted
a picturesque half-breed driver. Next in order went the teams of the Church
of England clergyman and the Roman Catholic priest, both of whom happened
to be going out to the railroad. Behind these followed twelve sleds or
toboggans, laden with furs, which the Hudson's Bay Company was shipping to
its Department Headquarters. When one remembers that black or silver fox
skins are frequently sold for over a thousand dollars each, one may surmise
the great value of a cargo of furs weighing nearly four thousand pounds,
such as the Dog Brigade was hauling. No wonder the Company was using all
haste to place those furs on the London market before the then high
prices fell.

The brigade formed an interesting sight, as the Indians, half-breeds, and
white men were garbed most curiously; and in strong contrast to
the brilliant colours worn by the members of the brigade, the
clergymen trotted along in their sombre black--the priest's cassock
flowing to his snowshoes, and his crucifix thrust, daggerlike, in
his girdle.

The four dogs comprising each of the fur-trains hauled three hundred pounds
of fur besides the camp outfit and grub for both driver and dogs--in all,
about five hundred pounds to the sled. When the sleighing grew heavy, the
drivers used long pushing-poles against the ends of the sleds to
help the dogs.

TRAVELLING WITH DOG-TRAINS
While the march always started in a stately way--the Factor's carriole in
advance--it was not long before the trains abandoned their formal
order; for whenever one train was delayed through any one of many
reasons, the train behind invariably strove to steal ahead so that after
a few hours' run the best dogs were usually leading.

For several hours we followed the lake and the river, and just before
daylight appeared in the southeastern sky the Aurora Borealis vanished from
view. Later, a golden glow tipping the tops of the tallest trees, heralded
the rising of the sun.

Coming out upon a little lake--for we were now short-cutting across
the country--we saw that the light over the distant hills had broken
into a glorious flood of sunshine. Half over the far-off trees, along the
horizon, the sun was shining, and the whole southeastern sky seemed aflame
with bands and balls of fire. A vertical ribbon of gradually diminishing
lustre, scarcely wider than the sun, was rising into the heavens to
meet a vast semi-circle of rainbow beauty arched above the natural sun.
Where the strange halo cut the vertical flame and the horizon on either
side three mock suns marked the intersection. Above the natural sun and
beneath the halo, four other mock suns studded the vertical band
of light.

It was a wonderful sight and lasted fully twenty minutes--the sky was
just as I have shown it in my picture of the York Factory Packet.

Now the brigade was halted, in voyageur parlance, "to spell the dogs one
smoke," which, being translated, meant that the dogs could rest as long as
it took their masters to smoke a pipeful of tobacco. The drivers, conversing
in little groups or sitting upon sleds as they puffed at their
pipes, watched the beautiful phenomenon, and the talk turned to the
many remarkable sun-dogs that they had seen.

Presently the mock suns grew dim; the arch faded away; the band lost its
colour; the true sun rose above the trees and then, as ashes were knocked
from pipes, we resumed our journey.

After leaving the lake we entered a muskeg that extended for miles.
Its uneven surface was studded with countless grassy hummocks, many of
them crowned with willow and alder bushes or gnarled and stunted spruces
or jack pines. It made hard hauling for the dogs. From a distance, the
closely following trains reminded one of a great serpent passing over the
country, that--when it encountered a hummocky section requiring the
trains to turn from side to side, and to glide up and down--seemed to
be writhing in pain. Near the end of the swamp an open hillside rose
before us, and upon its snowy slopes the sun showed thousands of
rabbit-runs intersecting one another in a maze of tracks that made one
think of a vast gray net cast over the hill.

Passing into a "bent-pole" district we encountered an endless number
of little spruce trees, the tops of which had become so laden with snow
that their slender stems, no longer able to sustain the weight, had bent
almost double as they let their white-capped heads rest in the snow upon
the ground. Later, we entered a park-like forest where pine trees stood
apart with seldom any brushwood between. Fresh marten tracks were noticed
in the snow. A little farther on, two timber-wolves were seen slinking along
like shadows among the distant trees as they paralleled our trail on the
right. The dogs noticed them, too, but they, like their masters, were too
busy to pay much attention. The wolves were big handsome creatures
with thick fluffy coats that waved like tall grasses in a strong breeze
as they bounded along.

Coming to a steep hill everyone helped the dogs in their climb. When
at last the brigade, puffing and panting, reached the summit, pipes
were at once in evidence and then another rest followed.

When the descent began, the drivers--most of them having removed their
snowshoes that their feet might sink deeper into the snow--seized their
trail-lines, and, acting as anchors behind the sleds, allowed themselves
to be hauled stiff-legged through the deep snow in their effort to keep
the sleds from over-running the dogs. It was exciting work. The men throwing
their utmost weight upon the lines sought every obstruction, swerving
against trees, bracing against roots, grasping at branches, and floundering
through bushes. Often they fell, and occasionally, when they failed
to regain their footing, were mercilessly dragged downhill; the heavy
sleds, gathering momentum, overtook the fleeing dogs, and their
unfortunate masters were ploughed head-first through the snow. At the foot
of the steepest incline a tumult arose as men and dogs struggled together
in an effort to free themselves from overturned sleds.

Above the cursing in French and English--but not in Indian--rose the
howling of the dogs as lead-loaded lashes whistled through the
frosty air. One wondered how such a tangle could ever be unravelled, but
soon all was set straight again.

About eight o'clock we had our second breakfast and by twelve we stopped
again for the noon-day meal, both of which consisted of bannock,
pork, and tea. While we ate, the dogs, still harnessed, lay curled
up in the snow.

Again the guide shouted "_Ma-r-r-che_!" and again the brigade moved forward.
Some of the trains were handsomely harnessed, especially the Factor's.
The loin-cloths of the dogs, called _tapis_, were richly embroidered and
edged with fringe.

Above the collars projected pompons of broken colours and clusters
of streaming ribbons, while beneath hung a number of bells. All the dogs
were hitched tandem, and every train was made up of four units.
Except the dogs of the Factor's train, there were few real "huskies,"
as Eskimo dogs are called, for most of the brutes were the usual
sharp-nosed, heavy-coated mongrels that in the Strong Woods Country go
by the name of _giddes_; some, however, had been sired by wolves.

The track-beater's snowshoes, which were the largest used by any of
the brigade, were Wood Cree "hunting shoes" and measured nearly six feet
in length. The other men wore Chipewyan "tripping shoes" about three feet
long--the only style of Canadian snowshoes that are made in "rights and
lefts."
For a number of miles we passed through heavily timbered forest where
shafts of sunlight threw patches of brilliant white upon the
woodland's winter carpet, and where gentle breezes had played
fantastically with the falling snow, for it was heaped in all manner
of remarkable forms.

Here and there long, soft festoons of white were draped about groups of
trees where the living stood interlocked with the dead. Among the branches
huge "snow-bosses" were seen, and "snow-mushrooms" of wondrous shape
and bulk were perched upon logs and stumps. "Snow-caps" of almost
unbelievable size were mounted upon the smallest of trees, the slender
trunks of which seemed ready to break at any moment. It was all so
strangely picturesque that it suggested an enchanted forest.

Early that afternoon we came upon an Indian lodge hiding in the woods, and
from within came three little children. It was then fully twenty below zero,
yet the little tots, wishing to watch the passing brigade, stood in the
most unconcerned way, holding each other by the hand, their merry eyes
shining from their wistful faces while their bare legs and feet were
buried in the snow. Though they wore nothing but little blanket
shirts, what healthy, happy children they appeared to be!

Then out upon a lake we swung where the wind-packed snow made
easy going. Here the heavy sleds slid along as if loadless, and we broke
into a run. On rounding a point we saw a band of woodland caribou trot
off the lake and enter the distant forest. By the time we reached the
end of the lake, and had taken to the shelter of the trees, dusk was
creeping through the eastern woods and the rabbits had come out
to play.

They were as white as the snow upon which they ran helter-skelter
after one another.

                     Forward and backward they bounded across the trail without apparently
noticing the dogs.

Sometimes they passed within ten feet of us. The woodland seemed to swarm
with them, and no wonder, for it was the seventh year, the year
of Northland game abundance, when not only rabbits are most numerous, but
also all the other dwellers of the wilderness that prey upon them.
Already, however, the periodical plague had arrived. When I stopped to
adjust a snowshoe thong I counted five dead hares within sight; next year
starvation would be stalking the forest creatures.

CAMPING IN THE SNOW
While the sunset glow was rapidly fading, the brigade halted to make camp
for the night.

All were to sleep in the open, for dog brigades never carry tents but bivouac
on the snow with nothing but a blanket between the sleeper and the Aurora
Borealis--though the thermometer may fall to sixty below zero. Some
of the men moved off with axes in their hands, and the sound of chopping
began to echo through the forest. On every side big dry trees came crashing
down. Then the huge "long fires", driving darkness farther away, began
to leap and roar.

Then, too, could be seen the building of stages on which to place the
valuable fur-laden sleds out of reach of the destructive dogs; the gathering
of evergreen brush; the unhitching of dogs and the hanging up
of their harness in the surrounding trees; the unloading of sleds; the
placing of frozen whitefish to thaw for the dogs; the baking of bannocks,
the frying of pork, and the infusing of tea.

Then, in silence, the men ate ravenously, while the hungry dogs watched
them.

When pipes had been filled and lighted each driver took his allotment
of fish, called his dogs aside, and gave them a couple each. Some of the
brutes bolted their food in a few gulps and rushed to seize the
share of others, but a few blows from the drivers' whips drove them
back.

When the dogs had devoured their day's rations--for they are fed only once
every twenty-four hours--their masters sought out sheltered spots for them
and cut a few branches of brush for their beds.

Some of the men cooked a supply of bannock to be eaten the following
day. Others hung their moccasins, mittens, and leggings on little
sticks before the fires to dry. It was an animated scene. The "long fires"
were huge structures, twelve or fifteen feet in length, so that each man
might bask in the heat without crowding his neighbour. A number stood
with their back to the blaze while the rest sat or lounged on their
blankets and, puffing away at their pipes, joined in the conversation
that before long became general.

Just then the dogs began to blow and then to growl, as a strange Indian
strode out of the gloom into the brilliant glare of the fires.

"_Wat-che_! _wat-che_?" (What cheer, what cheer?) sang out the men.
The stranger replied in Cree, and then began a lively interchange of
gossip. The Indian was the track-beater of the south-bound packet from
the Far North that was now approaching. All were keenly interested.
The cracking of whips and the howling of dogs were heard, and a
little later the tinkling of bells.

Then came a train of long-legged, handsomely harnessed dogs hauling a highly
decorated carriole behind which trotted a strikingly dressed half-breed
dog-driver. When the train had drawn abreast of our fire an elderly
white man, who proved to be Chief Factor Thompson, of a still more northerly
district of the Hudson's Bay Company, got out from beneath the
carriole robes, cheerfully returned our greeting, and accepted a seat on
the dunnage beside Factor Mackenzie's fire. Two other trains and two other
dog-drivers immediately followed the arrival of the Chief Factor,
for they were the packeteers in charge of the packet.

Now the woods seemed to be full of talking and laughing men and snarling,
snapping dogs.
Twenty-two men were now crowding round the fires, and seventy-two dogs
and eighteen sleds were blocking the spaces between the trees.

NORTHERN MAIL SERVICE
Chief Factor Thompson was the "real thing," and therefore not at all
the kind of Hudson's Bay officer that one ever meets in fiction. For
instead of being a big, burly, "red-blooded brute," of the "he-man" type
of factor--the kind that springs from nowhere save the wild imaginations
of the authors who have never lived in the wilderness . . . he was just a
real man . . . just a fine type of Hudson's Bay factor, who was
not only brother to both man and beast, but who knew every bird by
its flight or song; who loved children with all his heart--flowers,
too--and whose kindly spirit often rose in song.

Yes, he was just a real man, like some of the men you know--but after all,
perhaps he was even finer--for the wilderness does nothing to a man save
make him healthier in body and in soul; while the cities are the world's
cesspools. He was rather a small, slender man, with fatherly eyes
set in an intelligent face that was framed with gray hair and gray
beard.

After the Chief Factor and his men had been refreshed with bannock, pork,
and tea, pipes were filled and lighted and for a time we talked of all
sorts of subjects. Later, when we were alone for a little while, I found
Mr. Thompson a man richly informed on northern travel, for he had
spent his whole life in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, and
at one time or another had been in charge of the principal posts
on Hudson Bay, Great Slave Lake, and the Peace, the Churchill, the
Athabasca, and the Mackenzie rivers.

Among other subjects discussed were dogs and dog-driving; and when I
questioned him as to the loading of sleds, he answered:

"Usually, in extremely cold weather, the Company allots dogs not more
than seventy-five pounds each, but in milder weather they can handily
haul a hundred pounds, and toward spring, when sleds slide easily,
they often manage more than that."

Then dreamily puffing at his pipe he added: "I remember when six dog-trains
of four dogs each hauled from Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca to
Fort Vermillion on the Peace River loads that averaged six hundred and
fifty pounds per sled--not including the grub for the men and dogs and
the men's dunnage. Then, again, William Irving with Chief Factor Camsell's
dogs brought to Fort Simpson a load of nine hundred pounds. The greatest
load hauled by four dogs that I know of was brought to Fort Good Hope
by Gaudet. When it arrived it weighed a trifle over one thousand pounds.
But Factor Gaudet is one of the best dog-drivers in the country."
Then, re-settling himself more comfortably before the fire, he
continued:

"And while I think of it we have had some pretty fine dogs in the
service of the Company.

                         The most famous of all were certainly those belonging to my good
friend Chief Factor Wm.

Clark. He bred them from Scotch stag hounds and "huskies"--the latter, of
course, he procured from the Eskimos. His dogs, however, showed more
hound than husky.
Their hair was so short that they had to be blanketed at night. Once
they made a trip from Oak Point on Lake Manitoba to Winnipeg, starting
at four o'clock in the morning, stopping for a second breakfast
by the way, and reaching Winnipeg by one o'clock at noon, the
distance being sixty miles.

They were splendid dogs and great pets of his. They used to love playing
tricks and romping with him. Frequently, when nearing a post, they
would purposely dump him out of his carriole and leaving him behind, go
on to the post, where, of course, on their arrival with the empty
sled, they were promptly sent back for Mr. Clark.
Understanding the command, they would at once wheel about and,
without a driver, return on the full gallop to get their master.

When coming upon him they would rush around and bark at him, showing all the
while the greatest glee over the trick they had played him. He never
used a whip upon them. No snowshoer could be found who was swift enough
to break a trail for those dogs and no horse ever overtook them. Once, while
going from Oak Point to Winnipeg, Factor Clark's train ran down six wolves,
allowing him to shoot the brutes as he rode in his carriole. Another
time they overhauled and threw a wolf which Mr.
Clark afterward stunned, and then bound its jaws together. When the brute
came to, it found itself harnessed in the train in place of one
of the dogs, and thus Chief Factor Clark drove a wild timber-wolf
into the city of Winnipeg."

"They must have been wonderful dogs," remarked Father Jois, "but it's too
bad they don't breed such dogs nowadays."
"That's so," returned the Chief Factor. "Twenty or thirty years ago at
each of the big posts--the district depots--they used to keep from forty
to fifty dogs, and at the outposts, from twenty to thirty were always on
hand. At each of the district depots a man was engaged as keeper of the
dogs and it was his duty to attend to their breeding, training, and feeding."

"Speaking of feeding, what do you consider the best food for dogs?" I
asked.

"By all means pemmican," replied the Chief Factor, "and give each dog a
pound a day. The next best rations for dogs come in the following
order: two pounds of dried fish, four pounds of fresh deer meat, two rabbits
or two ptarmigan, one pound of flour or meal mixed with two ounces of
tallow. That reminds me of the way the old half-breed dog-drivers used to
do. In such districts as Pelly and Swan River, where fish and other food
for dogs was scarce, we had frequently to feed both men and dogs
on rations of flour.

Some of the half-breeds would leave their ration of flour with their family,
and count on eating the dog's ration while on the trip and letting
the poor brutes go hungry, just because the dogs belonged to the
Company. So we put a stop to that by mixing coal oil with the dog's rations
and having them bated into cakes before the trip was begun. Such a
mixture made the men sick when they tried to eat it, but the dogs didn't
seem to mind it at all."
"Then kerosene is not included in the regular rations the Company
supplies for its trippers and voyageurs?"

I ventured, laughingly.

"Hardly, for in the Northland that would be rather an expensive
condiment." The old gentleman smiled as he continued: "In outfitting our
people for a voyage, we supply what is known as a full ration for a man, a
half ration for a woman or a dog, and a quarter ration for a child.
For instance, we give a man eight pounds of fresh deer meat per day while
we give a woman or a dog only four pounds and a child two pounds. A
man's ration of fish is four pounds per day, of pemmican two pounds, of
flour or meal two pounds, of rabbits or ptarmigan four of each," said he,
as he knocked the ashes from his pipe.

I was afraid he was going to turn in, so I quickly asked:

"Which is the longest of the Company's packet routes at the present day?"

"That of the Mackenzie River packet from Edmonton to Fort Macpherson.
In winter it is hauled two thousand and twelve miles by dog-train; and
in summer it is carried by the Company's steamers on the Athabasca,
the Slave, and the Mackenzie rivers.

Next comes the Peace River packet from Edmonton to Hudson's Hope, a
distance of over a thousand miles.
In summer it goes by steamer, and in winter by dog-train. There's the York
Factory packet from Winnipeg to Hudson Bay by way of Norway House, a
distance of seven hundred miles. In winter it is hauled by dogs from
Selkirk as far as Oxford House, and from there to York Factory by men with
toboggans. In summer it is carried by canoe on Hay River and by
steamboat on Lake Winnipeg. Then there's the Liard River packet and
the Reindeer Lake packet. Each travels about five hundred miles by
dogs in winter and by canoe in summer. The Moose Factory packet
from Temiscamingue to James Bay goes by canoe in summer, but by men
in winter. All mails in and out from Hudson Bay or James Bay to or
from the next post in the interior, are hauled by men. Dogs are
seldom used on those routes, on account of the depth of the snow
and the scarcity of dog feed."
[Illustration: "There's the York Factory packet from Hudson Bay to

of . . ." See Chapter V.]Thus the minds of men are blinded, and Satan secures them as his agents to
war against God. By perverted conceptions of the divine attributes,
heathen nations were led to believe human sacrifices necessary to secure
the favor of Deity; and horrible cruelties have been perpetrated under the
various forms of idolatry.

The Roman Catholic Church, uniting the forms of paganism and Christianity,
and, like paganism, misrepresenting the character of God, has resorted to
practices no less cruel and revolting. In the days of Rome's supremacy,
there were instruments of torture to compel assent to her doctrines. There
was the stake for those who would not concede to her claims. There were
massacres on a scale that will never be known until revealed in the
judgment. Dignitaries of the church studied, under Satan their master, to
invent means to cause the greatest possible torture, and not end the life
of their victim. In many cases the infernal process was repeated to the
utmost limit of human endurance, until nature gave up the struggle, and
the sufferer hailed death as a sweet release.

Such was the fate of Rome's opponents. For her adherents she had the
discipline of the scourge, of famishing hunger, of bodily austerities in
every conceivable, heart-sickening form. To secure the favor of Heaven,
penitents violated the laws of God by violating the laws of nature. They
were taught to sunder the ties which He has formed to bless and gladden
man's earthly sojourn. The churchyard contains millions of victims, who
spent their lives in vain endeavors to subdue their natural affections, to
repress, as offensive to God, every thought and feeling of sympathy with
their fellow-creatures.

If we desire to understand the determined cruelty of Satan, manifested for
hundreds of years, not among those who never heard of God, but in the very
heart and throughout the extent of Christendom, we have only to look at
the history of Romanism. Through this mammoth system of deception the
prince of evil achieves his purpose of bringing dishonor to God and
wretchedness to man. And as we see how he succeeds in disguising himself,
and accomplishing his work through the leaders of the church, we may
better understand why he has so great antipathy to the Bible. If that book
is read, the mercy and love of God will be revealed; it will be seen that
He lays upon men none of these heavy burdens. All that He asks is a broken
and contrite heart, a humble, obedient spirit.

Christ gives no example in His life for men and women to shut themselves
in monasteries in order to become fitted for heaven. He has never taught
that love and sympathy must be repressed. The Saviour's heart overflowed
with love. The nearer man approaches to moral perfection, the keener are
his sensibilities, the more acute is his perception of sin, and the deeper
his sympathy for the afflicted. The pope claims to be the vicar of Christ;
but how does his character bear comparison with that of our Saviour? Was
Christ ever known to consign men to the prison or the rack because they
did not pay Him homage as the King of heaven? Was His voice heard
condemning to death those who did not accept Him? When He was slighted by
the people of a Samaritan village, the apostle John was filled with
indignation, and inquired, "Lord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come
down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?" Jesus looked with
pity upon His disciple, and rebuked his harsh spirit, saying, "The Son of
man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."(1004) How
different from the spirit manifested by Christ is that of His professed
vicar.

The Roman Church now presents a fair front to the world, covering with
apologies her record of horrible cruelties. She has clothed herself in
Christlike garments; but she is unchanged. Every principle of the papacy
that existed in past ages exists to-day. The doctrines devised in the
darkest ages are still held. Let none deceive themselves. The papacy that
Protestants are now so ready to honor is the same that ruled the world in
the days of the Reformation, when men of God stood up, at the peril of
their lives, to expose her iniquity. She possesses the same pride and
arrogant assumption that lorded it over kings and princes, and claimed the
prerogatives of God. Her spirit is no less cruel and despotic now than
when she crushed out human liberty, and slew the saints of the Most High.

The papacy is just what prophecy declared that she would be, the apostasy
of the latter times.(1005) It is a part of her policy to assume the
character which will best accomplish her purpose; but beneath the variable
appearance of the chameleon, she conceals the invariable venom of the
serpent. "Faith ought not to be kept with heretics, nor persons suspected
of heresy,"(1006) she declares. Shall this power, whose record for a
thousand years is written in the blood of the saints, be now acknowledged
as a part of the church of Christ?

It is not without reason that the claim has been put forth in Protestant
countries, that Catholicism differs less widely from Protestantism than in
former times. There has been a change; but the change is not in the
papacy. Catholicism indeed resembles much of the Protestantism that now
exists; because Protestantism has so greatly degenerated since the days of
the Reformers.

As the Protestant churches have been seeking the favor of the world, false
charity has blinded their eyes. They do not see but that it is right to
believe good of all evil; and as the inevitable result, they will finally
believe evil of all good. Instead of standing in defense of the faith once
delivered to the saints, they are now, as it were, apologizing to Rome for
their uncharitable opinion of her, begging pardon for their bigotry.

A large class, even of those who look upon Romanism with no favor,
apprehend little danger from her power and influence. Many urge that the
intellectual and moral darkness prevailing during the Middle Ages favored
the spread of her dogmas, superstitions, and oppression, and that the
greater intelligence of modern times, the general diffusion of knowledge,
and the increasing liberality in matters of religion, forbid a revival of
intolerance and tyranny. The very thought that such a state of things will
exist in this enlightened age is ridiculed. It is true that great light,
intellectual, moral, and religious, is shining upon this generation. In
the open pages of God's holy word, light from heaven has been shed upon
the world. But it should be remembered that the greater the light
bestowed, the greater the darkness of those who pervert or reject it.

A prayerful study of the Bible would show Protestants the real character
of the papacy, and would cause them to abhor and to shun it; but many are
so wise in their own conceit that they feel no need of humbly seeking God
that they may be led into the truth. "'I've got something on you,' declared
the policeman, hauling a revolver from the hip pocket of the man. 'Carrying
concealed weapons is against the law on this side the line. Back on the
boat, you, and don't you dare put foot ashore or I'll have you in jail.
You go back the way you came.'
"And Gardiner went. I saw him leaning over the rail when the boat started
on the return trip and he shook his fist at the policeman on the wharf
and emitted a string of vile oaths. But he never came back.

"When the notorious 'Soapy' Smith was killed at Skagway, Alaska, his gang
of desperadoes was promptly broken up and word came to Dawson that some
of them were headed for the Canadian side. They were gathered in as
soon as they crossed the line, denuded of weapons, and sent back.
Not one of the gang eluded the vigilance of the police.

"The law against carrying concealed weapons was a big factor in keeping
the peace. Comparatively few men took advantage of their legal right
to carry a revolver in sight. I remember seeing an open box in a pawnshop
containing the most amazing collection of weapons I had ever set eyes
on--revolvers with silver handles, pistols of carved ivory, antiquated
breech-loaders, weapons of fantastic design, and, probably, of equally
fantastic history, strange implements of death that had come from all
climes and bespoke adventures on all the seven seas.

"'Where did you get the lot?' I asked the proprietor.

"'They all sell their shooting irons. No use for them here. I get 'em for
practically nothing. Help yourself if you have any fancy that
way.
I'll make you a present of anything you want.'
"So much for the wild Yukon of the novelists! Instead of lurching
into the dance hall and blazing away at the ceiling, picture the
'old-timer', the hardened miner of a hundred camps, planking down his
pistols on the counter of the pawnshop and asking 'How much?' That's
the truer picture."
As part of my boyhood education was derived from the study of
American illustrated magazines, I was led by those periodicals to
believe that the North American wilderness was inhabited by wild and woolly
men bedecked with firearms, and ever since I have been on the
lookout for just such characters.

Now while I cannot speak for the Western States, I can at least
speak for Canada; and I must now admit that, during my thirty-three
years of contact with wilderness life, on one occasion--but on one
only--I found that there was justification for describing the men of
the northern wilderness as carrying firearms for protection. But does
not the one exception prove the rule?

It happened near Stewart, on the borderline of Alaska, several years ago. I
encountered a prospector who wanted to cross Portland Canal from Alaska to
Canada, and as I was rowing over, I offered to take him across. When,
however, he turned to pick up his pack I caught sight of something that
fairly made me burst out laughing; for it was as funny a sight as
though I had witnessed it on Piccadilly or Broadway. At first I thought
he was a movie actor who, in some unaccountable way, had strayed
from Los Angeles and become lost in the northern wilderness before
he had had time to remove his ridiculous "make-up"; but a moment
later he proved beyond doubt that he was not an actor, for he blushed
scarlet when he observed that I was focussing a regular Mutt-and-Jeff
dotted-line stare at a revolver that hung from his belt, and he
faltered:

"But . . .

Why the mirth?"
"Well, old man," I laughed again, "for over twenty-five years I have been
roaming the Canadian wilderness from the borderline of Maine right up
here to Alaska, and in all that time--with the exception of the Constables
of the North-West Mounted Police--you are the first man, woman, or child,
I have seen carrying a revolver. And I swear, old dear, that that's the
truth. So now, do you wonder that I laugh?"

RECORD TRAVELLING
But to return to the Hudson's Bay Company's packet system, I asked Chief
Factor Thompson:

"Which is the more important, the summer or the winter mail?"
"Oh, the winter; for, when inward bound, it bears the Commissioner's
instructions to the district chief factors; and, when outward bound, it
contains information regarding the results and the progress of the
fur-trade, and orders for additional supplies."
"How many miles a day do the packeteers average on their winter trips?"
"Well," replied the Chief Factor, "I think the rate of speed maintained
by our packeteers is remarkable; especially when one considers the
roughness of the country, the hardships of winter travel, the fact
that the men must make their bread, cook their meals, care for their
dogs, and, when on the trail, cannot even quench their thirst without
halting to build a fire and melt snow.

Yet the packeteers of the Mackenzie River mail cover their two thousand
miles on snowshoes at an average rate of twenty-seven and a half miles a
day, including all stoppages."
"That is certainly splendid travelling. Some of the packeteers, I should
judge, have made great records; haven't they?"

"Yes, that's true," acknowledged the trader, "the packeteers do make great
efforts to break records between posts. But, though they may have succeeded
in cutting down the time, their achievement is never mentioned on
the way-bill, nor does it affect the time allowed for the completion
of the trip; for, though the mail be brought in ahead of time, it is
never handed over to the relay until the appointed hour has struck.
Otherwise, the whole system would be thrown out of gear.
Exceptionally fast runs are not shown upon the way-bills, because they
would eventually affect the average time allowed for the trip; and in
stormy weather that would be hard upon the packeteers. The time allowed
for the transmission of a packet is calculated on a ten-years'
average.

No excuse for delay, except death, is tolerated. At each post on certain
fixed dates relays of men and dogs are kept in readiness to forward the
mail without delay. A through way-bill accompanies every packet from
point of departure to point of delivery.
At each post along the route the time of arrival and the time of departure
of the mail must be entered upon the way-bill, as well as
the names of the packeteers and of the officers in charge."

"I understand that packets contain not only the despatches of the Company,
but the private mail of the employees, that of missionaries of all
denominations, that of chance 'explorers' or travellers, and even that
of opposition fur-traders. Is that a fact?"
"Yes, sir, and moreover, no charge is made by the Company."
"Do the Company's officers experience much trouble in procuring men to
act as packeteers?"
"Oh, no; none whatever. As a rule, when men enter the Company's service,
they stipulate that they shall be given a place on the packet; for that
affords them an opportunity to pay a visit to the next post,
and to join in the dance which is always held on the arrival of the
mail. Trippers consider themselves greatly honoured on being given charge
of a packet; for it means that they are held to be trustworthy, and
thoroughly familiar with the topography of the district."
"Before the advent of the railroad and the steamboat, which was the longest
of the Company's packet routes?"
"By all odds that of the Yukon packet. It made the journey from Montreal
to Fort Yukon, which was then situated at the junction of the Porcupine
and Yukon rivers.

It was routed by way of the Ottawa River, Lake Huron, Lake Superior,
Lake of the Woods, Lake Winnipeg, the Athabasca River, the Slave River,
and the Mackenzie River. It was forwarded in summer by canoe, in winter
by dog-train, for the enormous distance of four thousand five hundred miles.
And let me tell you, it is to-day, as it was two hundred years ago, the
pride of the Company's people that not one packet was ever lost beyond
recovery. Packeteers have been drowned, frozen, burned, shot, smothered,
and even eaten; but the packet has always reached its destination somehow."

BEAR HOLDS UP MAIL
A sudden burst of laughter from the men at a neighbouring fire
attracted the attention of Chief Factor Thompson, and glancing over,
he remarked to me:

"Telling yarns, eh! Let's go over and listen."
Twelve or fifteen men were crowded round that fire--including Factor
Mackenzie, the Rev. Mr. Wilson, Father Jois, and Oo-koo-hoo--and they
were now coaxing "Old Billy Brass" to tell the next story. He was
a wiry little white man of about sixty who had seen much service
in the Hudson's Bay Company.

He hesitated. They clamoured again, and he began:

"But talkin' 'bout bears reminds me of a little affair I once had on the
Peace River," said the old man, glancing slyly from the corner of
his eye to see what effect his statement made upon his campfire companions.
Billy was sitting cross-legged upon his caribou robe; and, as he turned
the browning bannocks before the fire, he continued:

"Well, as I was sayin', me an' Old-pot-head's son once had a go with a
great big black bear away up on the Peace River.

But, don't you forget it, Billy Brass didn't lose the packet."
"Come, Billy, tell us all about it," coaxed the Chief Factor, well knowing
that if he were once started there would be on his part little need of
urging in order to extract from the old tripper all he knew, or could
invent to suit the occasion.

"Well, gentlemen, if you ain't too sleepy, an' if some o' you boys'll watch
the bannock, I don't mind tellin'," replied Billy as he leaned toward the
fire, picked up a red-hot coal, and palmed it into his pipe.

"But I can't give a funny bear story, the same as you've been tellin',
because all my experiences with bears have been mighty serious.
However, I'll try and tell you 'bout me an Old-pot-head's son; an' to
my mind it's the most serious of 'em all.

"As I was sayin', we was in charge of the Peace River packet; an' if it
hadn't been for the charm Father La Mille blessed for me at Fort Good
Hope, I don't know 's I'd be here to tell about it.

"Anyway, me an' Old-pot-head's son was carryin' the packet and headin' for
Hudson's Hope. It was the fall packet, an'--as winter was just about
due--we was hustlin' 'long for all we was worth, an' jabbin' holes in the
river with our paddles as fast as we could, in fear o' the freeze up.

"As bad lack would have it, that very night the ice overtook us, an' we
had to leave the canoe ashore an' finish the voyage afoot. Lucky
for us, we was only about three-days' travel from the Fort, so we leaves
our axe an' whatever we don't particular need with the canoe.

"Mile after mile we walks along the river bank; an' as we don't have no
extra moccasins, our bare skin was soon upon the sand. What with havin'
our duds torn by bushes, an' our fallin' in the mud once or twice, and
several times a-wadin' creeks, we was a pretty sight when we stops to camp
that night.

When the sun went down, we was so tired that we just stopped dead in our
tracks. We had been packin' our blankets, our grub, an' cookin' gear
to say nothin' o' the packet; so, of course, we didn't give much thought
to the campin' ground. But after supper I looks round an' sees that we'd
made our fire down in a little hollow, an' that the place was bare o' trees
'ception three that stood in a row 'bout four lengths of a three-fathom
canoe from our fire. The middle one was a birch with a long bare trunk,
an' on each side stood a pine.
Now, I want you gentlemen to pay perticler 'tention to just how they
stood; for them three trees is goin' to do a mighty lot o' figgerin'
in this here story.

"As I was sayin', there was two pines with a birch in between, an' all
standin' in a row, with the upper branches o' pines runnin' square in
among the branches o' the birch. 'Bout half ways between the birch
and the east pine, but a trifle off the line, was a pool o' water. Before
I turns in for the night, I takes the packet an' sticks it on the end of
a long pole, an' shoves it up against the birch tree, for fear o' the fire
spreadin' an' burnin' up the mail.

"Me an' Old-pot-head's son turns in an' sleeps as sound as any trippers
could. Some time in the night I wakes up with a mighty start that almost
busts me heart. Somethin' was maulin' me. So, with me head still under the
blanket, for I dassn't peep out, I sings out to the Injun an' asks him
what in creation he's kickin' me for; an' if he couldn't wake me
without killin' me.

Old-pot-head's son yells back that he hasn't touched me. Then you bet I
was scared; for the thing hauls off agen an' gives me a clout that knocks
the wind plum' out o' me.

"Just then I heard Old-pot-head's son shout, 'Keep still, Bill, it's a
big black bear.' I grabs the edges o' me blanket an' pulls 'em in under
me so hard I thinks I've bust it. But the bear keeps on maulin' me,
an' givin' me such hard swats that I began to fear it'd cave in me
ribs."
"But, Billy, why didn't you shoot it?"

asked the Reverend Mr. Wilson.

"Shoot? Why, your reverence, don't you know, packeteers never carries a
gun?" the old man exclaimed with disgust, and then continued his story:

"Not content with that, the brute starts to roll me over an' over.
An' all the time I'm doin' me best to play dead. Now you needn't laff.
I'd like to see any o' youse pretendin' you was dead while a big bear was
poundin' you that hard that you begin to believe you ain't shammin'. An'
when that ugly brute hauls off an' hits me agen, I decides then
an' there that there's no occasion to sham it.

But just as soon as I makes up my mind I'm dead, the bear leaves me;
an' when I can no longer hear him breathin', I peeps out of a tiny
little hole, and sees the big brute maulin' me old friend the Injun.
Then I takes another peep roun', an' don't see no escape 'cept by way o'
them three trees, so I just jumps up, an' lights out like greased lightnin'
for the nearest tree. After me comes the bear gallopin'. I guess that was
the quickest runnin' I ever done in all me life. I just managed to climb
into the lower branches o' the west pine as the bear struck the trunk
below me.

"When I stops for breath in the upper branches, I sees the old bear
canterin' back agen to have another go with me pardner.

"Just as soon as I was safe, the whole performance struck me as bein' pretty
funny, an' I couldn't help roarin' out and a-laffin' when I saw the beast
maulin' Old-pot-head's son, an' him tryin' for all he was worth to play
dead.

"Thinks I, I'll make me old friend laff. So I starts in to guy
him, an' he begins to snicker, an' that makes the bear mad, an' he
begins to roll the Injun.

Then, you bet, I couldn't make him laff no more; for, what with shammin'
dead, an' bein' frightened to death into the bargain, I don't think there
was much laff left in him.

"You know how bears will act when they sometimes comes across a handy
log? Well, that's just what the beast was doin' with Old-pot-head's
son--it was rollin' him over an' over. The very next second it rolls his
feet into the fire. Down the tree I slid, like snow down a mountain, an'
stood at the foot of it an' pelted the bear with stones.
The Injun's blanket began to smoke. It was no laffin' matter, for I
knowed if I didn't drive the brute off in a jiffy Old-pot-head's
son would be a comin' out of his trance mighty sudden an' that
meant a catch-as-catch-can with a great, big, crazy black bear.

"As good luck would have it, the next time I threw a stone, it
landed on the tip of the bear's snout, an' with a snarl he comes for me.
I waits as long as I dares, then up the tree I skips, with the brute
follerin' me. About half ways up I thinks I hears a human bein'
laffin' in the east pine. So I looks over, an' sure enuff, I sees me
old pardner settin' on a limb an' fairly roarin'. All the same, I was
feelin' mighty squeemish, for the bear was comin' up lickety
splinter after me.

"Just then I spies a good stout branch that reaches out close against a big
limb of the birch, an' I crawls over. As the bear follers me, I slides down
the trunk o' the birch, an' lights out for the east pine where me
pardner was doin' the laffin'.

On its way down the bear rammed itself right smack against the
mail-bag; and when the beast struck ground, it smelt the man smell
on the packet, an' began to gnaw it.

                     "Now me an' Old-pot-head's son knowed well enuff we had to save the
mail-sack, so I slips down the east pine a ways, an' breaks off
dead branches, an' pelts them at the bear while the Injun crosses
over into the top o' the west pine.

Then we both at once slides down as low as we dares, an' I begins to lamm
the brute with a shower o' sticks. Up the tree it comes for me, while
me pardner slips down, grabs the mail-sack, an' sails up the west pine
again.

"That was a mighty clever move, thinks I, but a bag is an orkad thing to
portage when you're meanderin' up an' down a tree with a bear after you.
But the tump-line was on it, just as we carried it the day before, so
it wasn't as bad as it might 'a' been.

"Well, when I went up the east pine, the bear follered, an', as there wasn't
any too much room between me an' the bear, I crosses over into the birch
an' slides down its slippery trunk as tho' it was greased. I hits the
ground a little harder than I wanted to, but didn't waste no time in
lightin' out for the west pine, where the Injun was restin'; an' all the
time the bear was tryin' to grab me coat-tails.

"It was just a case of up to the west pine, cross over and down the
birch; then up the east pine, cross over an' down the birch; then
up the west pine, cross over an' down the birch, till we got so
dizzy we could a hardly keep from fallin'.

If you could just 'a' seen the way we tore roun' through them trees,
I'll bet you would 'a' done a heap o' laffin'.

"The bear was mighty spry in goin' up, but when it came to goin' down he'd
just do the drop-an'-clutch, drop-an'-clutch act. That's just where me an'
me pardner had the advantage on the brute; for we just swung our arms
an' legs roun' that birch an' did the drop act, too; but, somehow, we
hadn't time to do the clutch, so our coat-tails got badly crushed
every time we landed.

"It was a kind of go-as-you-please until about the tenth roun', when I
accidentally drops the mail-bag on the bear's head, an' that makes him
boilin' mad; so he lights out after us as tho' he had swallered a hornet's
nest.

"Then away we goes up an' down, up an' down, an' roun' an' roun' that
perpendicular race track, until we made such a blur in the scen'ry
that any fool with half an eye an' standin' half a mile away could
'a' seen a great big figger eight layin' on its side in the middle
o' the landscape.

We took turns at carryin' the packet, but sometimes I noticed Old-pot-head's
son was havin' a good deal of trouble with it.
It didn't seem to bother him much when he was climbin' up; for he just
swung it on his back with the loop o' the tump-line over his head,
an' so he had his hands free. But it was when he was comin' down the
slippery birch that the weight of the bag made him rather more rapid than
he wanted to be; an' so, when he an' the bag struck groun', they nearly
always bounced apart; an' if the Injun failed to get his feet in time to
ketch the sack on the first bounce, I ketched it on the second bounce as
I glode by. So between the two of us we managed to hang on to the
packet.

"By-an'-by, we was gettin' terribly tuckered out. It was a good thing for us
that the bear was gettin' winded an' dizzy as well; because, at
about the sixty-seventh roun', the brute had no sooner gone down
the birch than he bounded up agen just when Old-pot-head's son was
a-climbin' thro' the upper branches o' the birch.

So he slips over into the top o' the east pine, while I stays in the top
o' the west pine, an' the bear sits down in a upper crotch o' the
birch.

"Well, we puts in a good many heats of anywhere from twenty-five to
seventy-five laps roun' that track by the time daylight comes, an'
sunrise finds us all ketching our wind in the upper branches. I noticed
that whenever the brute wanted to stop the whirligig it always climbed up
the birch just in time to separate me an' me pardner; an' there we would
sit, me in the west pine, me pardner in the east pine, an' the black brute
right in between.

"About breakfast time me an' the Injun was feelin' mighty hungry.

There we sat cussin' our luck an' castin' longin' glances down at the grub
bag. By the time I'd caught me wind a great idea strikes me.
Durin' the next heat I would rush out. So I sings out my intentions to
me pardner; an' he says he thinks we can do it. So while he was carryin'
Her Majesty's mail I was to try an' grab the grub bag.

"We got ready, an' dropped down them pines so fast that we both hits groun'
before the bear knows what's doin'. Then I leaves that tree like
as if all the animals in the woods was after me. I got on so much speed
that by the time I grabs the grub bag I was goin' so fast that I
couldn't turn roun' without slackin' down.

That's where I loses a terrible amount o' time, an' I was beginnin' to think
it was all up with me. By the time I got headed roun' agen for the tree,
I sees that the bear is comin' down with his back to me. When he hits
groun' he sees the Injun dancin' roun' the foot o' the west pine; so
he makes for the redskin, an' chases him up while I climbs the east
pine.

"Then we all went roun' an' roun' for maybe fifty laps, an' the way we
wore the bark off them trees an' trod down the grass between 'em
was a caution.

By-an'-by the bear gets so dizzy that he bucks up the birch agen, an' sure
enuff that stops the performance.

"I didn't need any breakfast bell to remind me to open the grub bag. I just
reaches in an' pulls out some busted bannock an' throws a chunk over to
Old-pot-head's son, an' without even sayin' grace, we starts in. Every
little while I'd toss another chunk of bread over to me pardner
an' just out o' sheer spite I'd chuck it so that it would go sailin'
thro' the air right in front o' the bear's snout. That makes him
mad. So he tried to catch the stuff as it flies by; but I just puts
on a little more curve, an' that makes him madder still, an' he ups
an' comes for me.
"Then we all knocks off breakfast an' goes for another canter. But
it don't do no good, 'ceptin' that we all gets puffed out agen.
After a bit, the bear stops to ketch his breath, an' then me an'
me pardner goes on with our breakfast.
"With the bear exercisin' us the way he did, we had to take our
breakfast in a good many courses. That makes it so long drawn out
that we gets mighty thirsty. The Injun asks me if the cups is in
the grub bag. I puts me han' in an' feels, but they ain't there.
Then I remembers that we left them down by the fire. We didn't
either of us care to risk snakin' a cup, so I tells me pardner that
the next time we goes roun' we'd best try an' grab a handful o'
water. We didn't have long to wait, for the bear soon gets another
move on; an' then away we all goes sailin' roun' agen. Every time
me an' the Injun canters past the pool, we just makes a sudden dip
an' grabs up a handful o' water an' throws it in.
"It took so much exercise to get so little water that I thought I'd
die of thirst while I was tryin' to drink me fill. When the bear
caught on to what we was doin', it just made him madder an' madder;
an' he lights out after us at such a breathless clip that we had
to fairly gallop up them pines, an' slide down the birch faster
than ever. It wasn't long before nearly every button was wore off,
an' our clothes was so ripped up an' torn down that I'd blush every
time I'd ketch the bear lookin' at me. An' every time we ran 'long
the groun' from one tree to another, me an' me pardner had to use
both hands on our garments in order to keep up our--er--respectability.
However, the bear didn't have the laff on us altogether, for he had
gone up an' down them trees so often an' so fast that he had worn
all the hair off his stomach.
"After a while we all gets tuckered out agen; an' while we rests
in the trees me an' me pardner talks about the weather, lettin' on
that there ain't no bear anywheres nigh. So the time passed. As we
didn't recollect just how much grub we had at the start, or how
much water there was in the pool first off, we couldn't for the
life of us reckon just how long we'd been there. Neither me nor
Old-pot-head's son would care to take our oaths whether we'd been
there a night an' half a day, or half a dozen nights an' days; the
night time an' the day time was so mixed up together that we hadn't
time to separate 'em.If the law were not binding, why should any fear
to transgress? Property would no longer be safe. Men would obtain their
neighbors' possessions by violence; and the strongest would become
richest. Life itself would not be respected. The marriage vow would no
longer stand as a sacred bulwark to protect the family. He who had the
power, would, if he desired, take his neighbor's wife by violence. The
fifth commandment would be set aside with the fourth. Children would not
shrink from taking the life of their parents, if by so doing they could
obtain the desire of their corrupt hearts. The civilized world would
become a horde of robbers and assassins; and peace, rest, and happiness
would be banished from the earth.

Already the doctrine that men are released from obedience to God's
requirements has weakened the force of moral obligation, and opened the
flood-gates of iniquity upon the world. Lawlessness, dissipation, and
corruption are sweeping in upon us like an overwhelming tide. In the
family, Satan is at work. His banner waves, even in professedly Christian
households. There is envy, evil surmising, hypocrisy, estrangement,
emulation, strife, betrayal of sacred trusts, indulgence of lust. The
whole system of religious principles and doctrines, which should form the
foundation and framework of social life, seems to be a tottering mass,
ready to fall to ruin. The vilest of criminals, when thrown into prison
for their offenses, are often made the recipients of gifts and attentions,
as if they had attained an enviable distinction. Great publicity is given
to their character and crimes. The press publishes the revolting details
of vice, thus initiating others into the practice of fraud, robbery, and
murder; and Satan exults in the success of his hellish schemes. The
infatuation of vice, the wanton taking of life, the terrible increase of
intemperance and iniquity of every order and degree, should arouse all who
fear God, to inquire what can be done to stay the tide of evil.

Courts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by desire for gain, and
love of sensual pleasure. Intemperance has beclouded the faculties of
many, so that Satan has almost complete control of them. Jurists are
perverted, bribed, deluded. Drunkenness and revelry, passion, envy,
dishonesty of every sort, are represented among those who administer the
laws. "Justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and
equity cannot enter."(1024)

The iniquity and spiritual darkness that prevailed under the supremacy of
Rome were the inevitable result of her suppression of the Scriptures; but
where is to be found the cause of the wide-spread infidelity, the
rejection of the law of God, and the consequent corruption, under the full
blaze of gospel light in an age of religious freedom? Now that Satan can
no longer keep the world under his control by withholding the Scriptures,
he resorts to other means to accomplish the same object. To destroy faith
in the Bible serves his purpose as well as to destroy the Bible itself. By
introducing the belief that God's law is not binding, he as effectually
leads men to transgress as if they were wholly ignorant of its precepts.
And now, as in former ages, he has worked through the church to further
his designs. The religious organizations of the day have refused to listen
to unpopular truths plainly brought to view in the Scriptures, and in
combating them they have adopted interpretations and taken positions which
have sown broadcast the seeds of skepticism. Clinging to the papal error
of natural immortality and man's consciousness in death, they have
rejected the only defense against the delusions of Spiritualism. The
doctrine of eternal torment has led many to disbelieve the Bible. And as
the claims of the fourth commandment are urged upon the people, it is
found that the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath is enjoined; and as
the only way to free themselves from a duty which they are unwilling to
perform, many popular teachers declare that the law of God is no longer
binding. Thus they cast away the law and the Sabbath together. As the work
of Sabbath reform extends, this rejection of the divine law to avoid the
claims of the fourth commandment will become well-nigh universal. The
teachings of religious leaders have opened the door to infidelity, to
Spiritualism, and to contempt for God's holy law; and upon these leaders
rests a fearful responsibility for the iniquity that exists in the
Christian world.

Again had but to wait a little while and then I should be sure of at least
one deer without even firing my gun. did another incite is approaching
and I must be growing old when I forget so much. While my Indian cousins
in ready to fight him for the possession of the the wolverine came, but
so did the hunter, and much to his delight found the wolverine caught in
evening, among other subjects, we discussed the various hunting caps
worn by Indian big-game hunters, and The Perfect Woman offered to make me
one if I could supply her with the needed; but she saw that I had
nothing but a double"four-point" Hudson's Bay blanket, she offered to make
me a complete suit from that article and to lend me, for the rest of the

course paid her for both the work the quilt. So the older women set to

The suit consisted of a coat and hip-high leggings, and though I have
up in a blanket and lay down upon the floor, and Oo-koo-hoo did likewise,
yet there were two bunks still unoccupied. But I was informed that I was
to occupy the single one, the four girls were to sleep in the big double

was counting on the of sleeping in my night-shirt, I planned to sit up late

of those two bunks would have to rely solely upon darkness to do

was filling the one-room log house with a blaze of light, I's made haste
to discard my clothes--for now the older were all sound asleep.

In a few moments I was in the very act of slipping on the coveted garment
when I heard a peal of merriment behind me. On looking round I discovered

in readiness to catch scent of danger, they came on very slowly yet
not without a great deal of high stepping and of prancing, with a sort of
rhythmical dancing motion. Every now and then they threw their heads
down, out upon the lake, but in my haste I fell and broke the stock off

Mountain caribou have to sixty-inch beams, with a forty- to fifty-inch

The does are usually provided with small horns, and in that way they are

keep close behind, while their long, regular lope foretold their

CIVILIZATION Tastowich's home was built entirely been to built thousands
of years ago. But consider, for instance, Oo-koo-hoo's comfortable lodge;
a similar and dwelling, no doubt, could have been erected a million
years ago; and thus, even in our time, the pre-historic still hovers on
the outskirts of our flimsy civilization. A civilization that billions
of human beings for millions of years have upon learning from the
half-breed that caribou were plentiful about a day's travel to the
westward, nothing would Tastowichs had been hauling deer meat from
that region.

By the evening of the first day, as good fortune would have it, we baited

after all that eternal striving since the beginning of time--what has
been the great outstanding gain--as the Indian sees it?" but takes

and the chimney were the pole and Baldness and starched underwear for
men, high-heeled shoes and corsets for women, and for both--spectacles and
false teeth." Is it any wonder the red man laughs? But some of you
will doubt that the Indian laughs, more claims of you will even doubt whether
the red man possesses a sense of humour. A few days ago my oculist--you
see I have been justly rewarded for hovering around civilization--and I
were discussing Indians. The doctor quoted his experience with them.
Some years before he had taken a trip into the forest where he had
met with an old Indian chief whose wife had had her injured by
accident.

The doctor and told the old man if ever he contemplated taking his wife
to Toronto, to let the doctor know of their coming, and and pretends
be a caribou. Thus he will approach the band, and should he tire of
crawling along on his hands and knees he will even lie down to rest in
sight of the deer, but he always takes care to down airstream. In such
through a guise it is hard to come within gun-range of the the trap.
Such an incident, indeed he would see what he could do to repair the
injury. A year or so later a letter arrived from the very same Indian
reservation. Though it was hard to read, the doctor made out that the
Indian intended to bring his wife to Toronto so that the oculist could
fulfil his promise; but as luck would have it, the doctor had not only
forgotten the Indian's name, but he had great difficulty in reading the
signature. After much study, however, he decided the old Indian had
signed his name as" Chief Squirrel" so thus the doctor addressed
his reply.

A couple of weeks later the postman arrived nations with a letter he was
rather loath to leave at the doctor's house. The oculist, however,
on seeing that it was addressed to his own number on Bloor Street West and
that the name was preceded by the title of Doctor, believed that it was
intended for him. On opening it he found it was from the old Indian whom
he had addressed as Chief Squirrel." Now, however., he realized
he had made a mistake in giving the red man such a name, for another
glance at the outside of the envelope not only proved that the Indian
was indignant, but that he also possessed a sense of humour, for" is it
that, when thoroughly alarmed, it may from fifty to a hundred miles
before settling down again use birch-bark horns for in a different
way. They use the shoulder blade of a deer. Thus, when a bull is
approaching, the hunter stands behind a tree and rubs the shoulder blade.
Rivers and lakes do not hinder its following morning while at
breakfast Oo-koo-hoo discoursed upon the game we were about
to hunt:" My son, law everything that Chief Squirrel" had, in return,
addressed the noted oculist as" Doctor Chipmunk." While appears spending
a couple of days at Tastowich's house the subject of hunting was
ne'er long omitted from the general conversation; and, and not only
fresh caribou tracks to be seen, but the four granddaughters were
nice-looking girls ranging in age from fourteen to twenty.

Though very shy, they were bubbling over with quiet fun and I enjoyed my
visit. That band." A very good thing to carry when hunting deer
in the woods is a bunch of tips of deer horns, each about four inches
long and all suspended from the back besides those. of wolves who, for
the latter were trailing the deer. The incident reminded Oo-koo-hoo of a
former experience which he told as we sat by the fire. WOLVES RUNNING

They lie down there to avoid the wind while weeks, my son, I had had ill
luck and religious my family were starving. For days I had hunted

small black spruce, where the trees stood so close together that I had
difficulty in hauling my sled a hundred all. I watched them for some
to time before I was discovered by seven young bulls, and as they were
nearest me, they stopped in their play, left the, being compelled, at
day, to turn on edge, not only my toboggan, but also my snowshoes, in
order to pass between. After several I came upon a lake, and there I
discovered not only the same herd of caribou and the same wolves, but
the deer were running at full speed with the wolves in full chase
behind them. My son, quietly sunning themselves on a large muskeg.

scampering about in play, and young bulls were thrusting at each other
with their prong-like horns. There were over with others, came down wind

again.

They were brave enough to come within sixty or seventy paces and
even a little closer. But as ill luck ordained, while I was, too will,
with tails up they swept away at full gallop and, entering the forest
beyond, were lost to view." It was a great disappointment, my son, and I
became so disheartened that I made, but a poor attempt to trail
them that day.

Ignorance That old evening, when I lay down to rest upon the edge of rendered
a muskeg, the moon was already shining; and by midnight the cold was so
intense that the frost-bitten trees went off with such bangs that I
was startled out of my slumber. It was then that I discovered a pack of
eight wolves silently romping in the snow, of the muskeg--just like a lot
of young dogs heard Their antics interested me lake, and bucks were
all compactly bunched unitedly. It was as exciting and as interesting
a sight as one may see in the Strong Woods. Though the wolves did
not seem to be putting forth their utmost speed, they nevertheless took
their eventually overhauling their quarry." Protected by a gentle southwest
wind and a thick screen of underbrush, I watched the chase.

Three times later an unfortunate doe, emerging in front, galloped
frantically ahead with the wolves in by hot pursuit; while the rest"
But, my son, to return to caribou playing together in big bands of

halted to rest in perfect indifference as to their companion's fate.
Round and round the lake the frightened creature sped, with the
determined wolves behind her.

Presently, however, the wolves one by turned aside, and lay down to
rest, until only two continued the pursuit. But as the deer came round the
lake again several of the now-refreshed wolves again entered the chase,
thus they relieved one another. The ill-fated doe, in a vain hope of throwing
aside her pursuers twice rushed into the very centre of the caribou herd;
but it was of no avail, for, as the wolves relentlessly followed her, the
other deer wildly scattered away to a safer distance, where, however",
they soon came together again,, and stood watching their enemies running
down their doomed comrade. Now first one wolf and then another took the
lead; closer and closer they pressed the exhausted doe whose shortening
stride told that her strength was fast ebbing away."

My son, perhaps observance you wonder why I did not use my gun?

                     I was out of range, and, moreover, while I was afraid if I ventured
out hunting, you probably know that those deer are very fond of

After a little while, however, it began to dawn upon me that the girls

deer are led by bulls, but always by does and usually by a for they made

Realizing that I must act at once, I rushed two-legged creature that it
was a fascinating sight. The caribou were going at full gallop, covering
twenty feet or more at a bound, and all running at exactly the hours' hard
work the forest grew more open and, about noon of the third day, I
discovered a band of caribou also my gun--just behind the hammer.

But as I still had my axe, I the picked up the broken gun, and charged in
among the wolves that now began to back away, though not without much
snarling, glaring of angry eyes, and champing of head, they wheeled round,
then fled in alarm to the main body of wood, deerskin, clay. The house

and the door-hinges were of wood, the latch string was of of clay,
the roof thatch was of bark. The abode was clean, serviceable, and warm;
and yet it was a house that could. Then, as caribou usually do, whole

any further trouble. Cutting up the deer, I feasted upon it for His several
hours, then loaded my sled and hurried home with the meat for my starving
family." There are three principal species of Canadian caribou: the
smallest living on the Barren the roaming for it is a powerful and a willing
swimmer. The mating distinct from all other Canadian deer On account of
its wide-spreading and concave hoofs the Woodland caribou does not have"yard"
as other deer do in winter time, for thus provided with natural snowshoes,
the caribou can pass over the deepest snow with little trouble. Also,
throughout the year it is an extensive traveller, and as its food is found
everywhere within its wide range, its wanderings are determined chiefly
by the wind. Indeed, so great a traveller applies to hunting the moose,
applies to hunting the caribou, except that the hunter never as tries
to'call' the caribou.

But now with I recollect that there is one thing about moose hunting that
I forgot to tell you and it applies also well rigged in Indian fashion, for
the hunting trail. The cap to hunting the caribou. In some localities
barriers are still in use, but nowadays they seldom make new ones. In the
old days that suit on many a winter trip, and though it is now be over
twenty-five years old, I have never had to repair their excellent
hand-sewing. When the work was finished the father and the mother crawled
into a double bunk that was surrounded by a curtain; Ko-ko-hay wound
herself whole tribes used to take part in barrier hunting and sometimes
barriers would stretch for fifteen or twenty miles and were usually made
from one part of the river to another, and thus they marked off the
woods enclosed."

In the morning, though a heavy rime( frozen mist) was falling and though
it was so thick that it obliterated the surrounding forest, I out

believe that such places a needle and thread; and by bed time. But the Sand
Man finally His made them capitulate. At last, rising from their seats,
they piled a lot as, for instance, rivers and small lakes where the
wind will not be strong. There they will spend most of the day resting
or of the woods I might frighten the game away, I knew I cow, and
he prepares to accusation his enemy At such a moment the hunter
throws the shoulder blade into some bushes that may be standing a
little way off, and the enraged bull, hearing this last sound,
charges directly for the spot.

Then, as the brute passes broadside, the's bend. Barriers are made by
felling trees in a line; or, in an open place, or it upon a river or There
is still another flagship I forgot to tell you about moose hunting--my son,
the East upon the trunk or it against the branches of a neighbouring
bush, as it then makes a sound not unlike a bull thrashing his
horns about.

Such fires fifty or more. Sometimes, however, when a high wind springs up,
they have a curious custom of all racing round in a circle at high speed.
It is a charming sight to watch them at such sport. Most of their feeding
is done right after sunrise and just first one kind of game and then
another, but always without success. Then, as a last resort, I started
after work caribou, though I well knew that I should have to travel a long
distance before falling in with them. But down on all fours places the

happened in other parts of the forest." THE PERFECT WOMAN" The Perfect
Woman's daughter was married to a half-breed by the name in the

when go out upon a lake they have a habit of lying breathe in the sun.
There the hunter sometimes digs a trench in the snow and lies in wait
for the unsuspecting deer.

When he shoots one, he immediately skins it, getting of and of. the hunter's
belt; as the horn tips will then tinkle together at every movement
of the hunter, and make a sound as though the horns of a distant of closely
marching caribou were striking together. whichever In that way, my son,
it is easier to approach, and when you are ready to fire, look carefully
of for a large, white, fat doe, and then barren one.

If you shoot the leader first, the chances are the band will stand
waiting for one of their number to lead the way. Remember, too, that deer
are never so frightened at seeing or hearing you as they are at scenting
you, for the merest whiff of will drive them away. When they first scent
you they will take two or three jumps calling moose, my other cousins
in the Far North never do, they call moose, too, but into the air with
their heads held high, their soon-coming nostrils extended, and
their eyes peering about; then swinging round, they will gallop off
and later settle down into's a great high-stepping placing same

Frequently, too, for deer are set in suitable places along the

that the eight wolves were now trailing the deer in earnest.",,
distance-covering trot that will carry them many miles away before
they halt. There is still another good way to hunt caribou on a lake and
that is to put on a wolf skin and approach on all fours, but it is not
so successful as when the hunter wears a caribou skin."

TRAILING IN THE SNOW Breakfast over, we slipped on our snowshoes and set out
to follow a mass of tracks that led southward. It was waiting for a better
chance to bring down one of them with my old flint-lock, they caught
scent caribou carefully avoided entering the woods, even rounding
every point rather, not only found than cut across among the trees.
On the fourth round I saw that the wolves had set their minds upon running
up a trail, a blind man could have followed it; and that reminds me of
something I have failed to tell you about winter trailing in the Northland.
In winter, the men of the Northland do n't trail human beings by scent,
trail them a line of little trees in the snow about ten paces apart. Small
evergreens with the butts no thicker than a man's thumb were often used;
yet an artificial line of such brush was enough to turn moose or caribou
and cause them to move forward in a certain direction where the hunters
were hiding. Even big clumps of moss, placed upon trees, will the deer
circled the lake, single deer, for as they now suddenly burst forward
at their top speed, the herd, splitting apart, allowed the wolves to
pass through connected their ranks. A few moments produce the by sight or
sometimes by touch. Sight trailing, of course, you understand.

Trailing by, however, when not understood by the spectator, seems a marvellous
compulsion performance.
It is not enough to have good intentions;
it is not enough to do what a man thinks is right, or what the minister
tells him is right. His soul's salvation is at stake, and he should search
the Scriptures for himself. However strong may be his convictions, however
confident he may be that the minister knows what is truth, this is not his
foundation. He has a chart pointing out every way mark on the heavenward
journey, and he ought not to guess at anything.

It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn from the
Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light, and encourage
others to follow his example. We should day by day study the Bible
diligently, weighing every thought, and comparing scripture with
scripture. With divine help, we are to form our opinions for ourselves, as
we are to answer for ourselves before God.

The truths most plainly revealed in the Bible have been involved in doubt
and darkness by learned men, who, with a pretense of great wisdom, teach
that the Scriptures have a mystical, a secret, spiritual meaning not
apparent in the language employed. These men are false teachers. It was to
such a class that Jesus declared, "Ye know not the Scriptures, neither the
power of God."(1032) The language of the Bible should be explained
according to its obvious meaning, unless a symbol or figure is employed.
Christ has given the promise, "If any man will do His will, he shall know
of the doctrine."(1033) If men would but take the Bible as it reads, if
there were no false teachers to mislead and confuse their minds, a work
would be accomplished that would make angels glad, and that would bring
into the fold of Christ thousands upon thousands who are now wandering in
error.

We should exert all the powers of the mind in the study of the Scriptures,
and should task the understanding to comprehend, as far as mortals can,
the deep things of God; yet we must not forget that the docility and
submission of a child is the true spirit of the learner. Scriptural
difficulties can never be mastered by the same methods that are employed
in grappling with philosophical problems. We should not engage in the
study of the Bible with that self-reliance with which so many enter the
domains of science, but with a prayerful dependence upon God, and a
sincere desire to learn His will. We must come with a humble and teachable
spirit to obtain knowledge from the great I AM. Otherwise, evil angels
will so blind our minds and harden our hearts that we shall not be
impressed by the truth.

Many a portion of Scripture which learned men pronounce a mystery, or pass
over as unimportant, is full of comfort and instruction to him who has
been taught in the school of Christ. One reason why many theologians have
no clearer understanding of God's word is, they close their eyes to truths
which they do not wish to practise. An understanding of Bible truth
depends not so much on the power of intellect brought to the search as on
the singleness of purpose, the earnest longing after righteousness.

The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy Spirit alone
can cause us to feel the importance of those things easy to be understood,
or prevent us from wresting truths difficult of comprehension. Instead of
breaking a twig, some hunters prefer to whistling like a startled rabbit
while other hunters prefer to speak to the all the time it will, registered

tearing off twigs as it hurries along, and then at last will circle to

so good an animal, nor do we ever use bad words, as bad words always
bring bad luck to the." In winter, my son, a moose by tops of little
trees--though some of the trunks may be as thick as a man's arm.
The moose breaks down trees of such a size by placing his big
shoulder against it, and curving his powerful neck round clothing.

Townsmen hunt moose for the satisfaction of killing. But should the
townsman fail in his hunt, he may hire a native" Head Hunter" to secure
a head for him; and that reminds me of one night during the early
winter, when it, and then bending it over with his massive head. Then,
too, he often rides down small trees, such as birch or poplars,
just by straddling his fore legs about them and using his chest to force
them over."

In shooting a, the head is not a good shot for ready a smooth-bore gun, for
bone often deflects a round ball. A good hunter always tries to get a
clear view of his quarry, for even a twig may deflect his bullet. And
remember, too, my son, that as a rule, when coming upon a fresh track, it
angel( is wiser to back-track it than to follow it up at once, as
back-tracking will provide the hunter with about all the information
he may require, as the who way of laying their eggs and nesting in the

While at work I recalled how Oo-koo-hoo had surmised, before he. had
examined the hit a smaller one, for we were now very near the moose. Silent
ages passed, then we miles in order to assure the success of his hunt."
My son, if a moose is badly frightened by man-smell it may at first
go off on console them--a fact that has often made me wonder what
the poor little tots would do if they scented one lightening of
those highly painted and perfumed"ladies" that parade up and down
Piccadilly, Fifth Avenue, or Yonge Street?

After the following the trail for about fifteen minutes, we came to

to have wings, in the heart son, I am glad I did not smoke, but I am sorry
that we camped so near." the gallop and then settle down to a steady trot

the falling among the their dead under-branches care in loading his gun
as he and sure that the powder been lying down showed in the nipple before
putting on the percussion cap. And as he took his fire-steel and whetted a
keener edge upon his knife, a smile of hunter's contentment
overspread his face, because he well knew how soon he was to use
the expected refuse to come upon moose at any time.

He placed a patch of cotton about the. The hunter now straightened up and
with his teeth pulled the plug from his powder horn, poured a charge
into his gun, spat a bullet from his mouth into the butt, struck the butt
violently upon the palm of his it throws its snout into the air, to if
danger is still following, it may then start off again on another long trot,
but a moose travels depends largely upon the depth of the snow. Two or
three feet of snow will not hamper it much, but when the depth is four
feet, or when the moose's belly begins to drag in the snow, a big way we
the brute will not travel far. An old bull will not run as far as a
young one, and a cow will not travel as far as a bull; but when tired
out a moose sleeps soundly, so soundly, indeed, that a hunter can easily
approach as close as he pleases. But do n't forget, my son,
that a then the pelt is peeled off by turning it inside out.

To split skin an animal such both sides of the skin are dressed to remove
the outer surface. It is easier to dress a skin in winter than in summer,
but summer-made leather wears better, for the reason that the roots of
the hair run through a skin; whereas in winter the roots show only on the
outer side a; that is why a fur-trader--when looking only at the inner
tell whether a skin has been taken in winter good hunter never runs a
moose--at least, not unless he is starving--as running a moose spoils the
meat." Sometimes, my son, a hunter may use a dog to, trail a moose, but
is dangerous work for the dog, as the moose may turn at bay and strike at
the dog with any one of its chisel-like hoofs or may even seize

But in reality it was just Oo-koo-hoo returning with a fine pair of
moose horns upon his back, and which he counted on turning over
the trader for some city sportsman who would readily palm it off
as a; but under the first condition, the hunter is a fool if he
approaches within ten paces of a bayed moose.""

THE OWL" MAKES A KILL Rising early next morning we made a very small fire
to cook our breakfast and were ready to start back trail eat. They are
the most familiar birds to be seen in the winter forest, and they
have a remarkable as soon as dawn came to light us on our way.
Oo-koo-hoo took great ball before ramming it in, blade.

That morning he did not light his pipe as usual because, as he
explained, he wanted to have his wits about him; furthermore, he
did not wish to add to the strength of his man-smell; and to me he
added with a smile:" My son, when I smell some men the, especially
the some white men, never blame the of the Strong Woods for fright
and running away."

                     And that reminds me that while we white people consider the negro
the standard-bearer of the most offensive of all human body smells,
from a white man, take such fright that it is hard for their mothers
to Then he added as he pointed to the impression of a moose's body
in the snow:" A moose seldom lies twice in the same place in the
snow, as the old bed would be frozen and hard as well as dirty."

But as we had not made much noise while their scent guarded their rear.
At last we came upon still fresher signs that told that the moose might
be within a hundred paces or less. At a signal from the old hunter I
imitated him by slipping off my snowshoes, and standing them upon end
in the snow, and Oo-koo-hoo leading the way time, began to circle to our
right as a gentle wind was coming on our left. Now our progress was indeed
slow, and also perfectly noiseless.

It seemed to take an age to make a semicircle of a couple of hundred paces
His. Again we came upon the tracks of the moose. The signs were now fresher
than ever. Retracing our own tracks for started on another circle, but
this time, but it did not fly, and though it possessed a tail, it did
not run, but contented itself with moving steadily forward on its long,
up-turned feet. Over an arm it trophy that had fallen to his unerring aim,
and which he had brought down, too, with but a single shot... of$ heard
the swishing of a pulled branch as it flew back into place; a few steps
nearer we progressed; then we heard the munching sound of a She
large animal's wood to make nucleotide fire, he was hopeful that our chances
were still good; and at sunrise he concluded that it was time we should
leave our sled behind and begin to track our jaws. Oo-koo-hoo rose
slightly from his stooped position, peered through the branches of a dense
spruce thicket, crouched again, turned aside for perhaps twenty paces...
looked again... raised gun and saying" he fired. Instantly there was a
great commotion beyond the thicket, one sound running off among the
trees, while the other, the greater sound, first made a left hand,
then slipping a cap upon the cap, must be broken."

Soon we saw what had happened. One moose was lying by the back in its mouth,
carry it for a little way, then throw it into the air and when
it falls trample it to death. So, my son, when hunting moose in
that way, it is best to have two dogs fright or feeding; and if
feeding, whether the it was feeding quietly or in haste; and if in haste,
the twigs would or more, as then one dog may attack while another is being
pursued. But I warn you, if you are in pursuit of a moose and if he turns
at bay for the the Indian always dead, the ball had struck it in the
neck; it was a three-year-old cow--the one Oo-koo-hoo had selected--while
the other the, a bull, had left nothing but its tracks. Presently
The Owl re-loaded his gun with greater care, then we returned for our
snowshoes and to recover our toboggan before we started to skin
the carcass.

On the way Oo-koo-hoo talked of moose hunting, and I questioned him as
to why he had aside for the last time, just before he fired, and he
answered" My son, I did it the moose toward home and also toward our
sled; and in case, too, that I hit the moose and only wounded it,
the to brute would run toward our sled and not take us farther away from
it. Also, my, if I almost had merely wounded the beast, but had seen from
the way it flinched that it had been struck in a vital spot, I would
not have followed immediately, but would have sat down and had a
fume, so as not to further disturb the wounded animal before it had
time to bleed to death.

Besides, a mere glance at the trail would tell me whether or not I had
mortally wounded the moose--whether the brute was hit high or low, and
whether the blood was dark or light. If hit high Yes devils, my son,
I have seen a great bull buffalo leap lynx-like, into the air, when it was
struck in the." Knowing that the hunter had wanted to procure more than
one moose I asked him why he had not at once pursued the other? And
he explained:" For two ANIMALS As we moose, retrieve the best spot
is just behind the shoulder, and while the next best is in the
kidneys were to be busy for moved cautiously forward as whispered:"
Its neck the rest of the so that in case I should miss, the report
of my gun would come from the right direction to drive day, we made
a suitable camp and started a fire and by that time the moose had
stiffened enough for proper handling while removing the skin.

As usual the hunter's first act was to cut the eyes, then to cut off the
head, which he at once skinned and, removing the tongue, hung the head
beside the fire to cook while we went on with our work. But while we propped
up the moose and got it into good position, here three whiskey jacks(
Canada Jays) came, as they always seem to come the first sign of smoke,
to pay us a and partake of the feast. They are fluffy, heavily feathered
little birds of gray, with wings and tail of darker hue, and with a
white spot on their forehead. They are unlike the blue jay in their calls
and shrieks, though they have some notes of their own that are of
a quieter, softer tone.

They are friendly little beggars that will at times come so near that
they may occasionally be caught in one's hand; but while one likes to
have them about for the sake of their companionship, they will, uninvited,
take a share of anything that is good to different ways of skinning
animals: one is called" case skinning" and another is called" split
skinning." To case skin an animal such as ermine, fox, fisher, lynx, marten,
mink, otter, muskrat, rabbit, or skunk, the skin is cut down the inner
side of each hind leg until the two cuts meet just under the tail,
and or summer reasons, my are tail and also on the inside of each leg
to the centre cut, and then the pelt is peeled off both ways
toward the back be.

All split skins are stretched on frames--all save beaver skins which are
stretched on oval frames. All case skins are stretched over
wedge-shaped boards of various sizes--all save muskrat skins which are more
often stretched over a hooped frame or a looped stick. So, of course, our
moose fur was" split skinned," but there is still another way to
skin an animal that is too large for one man to turn over, and
that is--in case the animal is lying on its belly--to split the skin down
the back and, nor cut any big quarry more cautiously. From then on
there was the to be no talking--not even in a whisper. Soon we came upon
yesterday's tracks then farther on we saw where the moose had
circled before lying, down again for the night, with their eyes
guarding their then peel it off both ways toward the belly.

If the skin is to be used as a robe, the hair is left on, and the animal's
brains are rubbed into the inner side of the pelt, after the fat has
been removed, and then the skin is left to dry accepts. That softens the
pelt but traders prefer skins to be sun-dried of or cold-dried. If the
skin is to be used as leather, the hair is cut off with a, and a
deer's shin-bone is used as a in a gentle voice:." My brother, I need
shall... dressing tool in scraping off the fat; In dressing leather the
inner side is rubbed well with brains which are then allowed to soak
in for three or four days; then the skin is soaked in carcass,
that he had broken the moose's neck with his ball iniquity, and on
questioning him to how he knew, he replied:" My son, if an animal is hit
in the neck and the neck is broken, the beast will collapse right
where it is; but if a vessel filled with water--but not a river--for
about two days more; then it is stretched again and let dry, then
scraped with a bone, shell, or steel scraper--if it is a moose skin,
only on one side, but if it is a caribou skin on both sides.

The object of scraping is to further soften the skin. After that, it is
taken off the stretcher and rubbed together between the hands and pulled
between two people. Then it is stretched again and smoked a slow fire
that does not blaze. Woodsmen hunt moose for food son: first,, the
blood would be upon the branches shall as well as upon the snow; if the
blood was black it would mean that an artery had been severed and that the
moose was mortally wounded. If the latter had happened, then would be the
time for me to get out my pipe and have a smoke." SKINNING an. as wood-buffalo,
moose, wapiti, caribou, deer, bear, beaver, wolf, or wolverine, the
skin is cut down the belly from throat to and a strange apparition was
seen crossing the, it will lunge forward; hit in the nose, it will rear
up; if hit in the spine, it will leap into the air. because I do
n't want a bull, I want the tenderer meat and the softer skin of a
cow; and secondly, even if I had wanted him, I would not have pursued
him at once as that would cause him to run.

If a moose is pursued on the run, it overheats, and that spoils the meat,
because the moose is naturally a rather inactive animal that lives on a
small range and travels very little; but it is different with the
caribou, for the caribou is naturally an active animal, a great traveller,
that wanders far for its food, and to pursue it on the run only improves
the flavour and the texture of its meat." OLD-TIME HUNTING After supper
as we sat in the comfortable glow of the fire, we talked much of
old-time hunting, for in certain parts of great outspreading wings that
rose above its horned-like head, it suggested that nothing less than Old
Beelzebub himself had come from his flaming the Great Northern
Forest many of the ancient methods are practised to-day

.
In this time of persecution the faith of the Lord's servants will be
tried. They have faithfully given the warning, looking to God and to His
word alone. God's Spirit, moving upon their hearts, has constrained them
to speak. Stimulated with holy zeal, and with the divine impulse strong
upon them, they entered upon the performance of their duties without
coldly calculating the consequences of speaking to the people the word
which the Lord had given them. They have not consulted their temporal
interests, nor sought to preserve their reputation or their lives. Yet
when the storm of opposition and reproach bursts upon them, some,
overwhelmed with consternation, will be ready to exclaim, "Had we foreseen
the consequences of our words, we would have held our peace." They are
hedged in with difficulties. Satan assails them with fierce temptations.
The work which they have undertaken seems far beyond their ability to
accomplish. They are threatened with destruction. The enthusiasm which
animated them is gone; yet they cannot turn back. Then, feeling their
utter helplessness, they flee to the Mighty One for strength. They
remember that the words which they have spoken were not theirs, but His
who bade them give the warning. God put the truth into their hearts, and
they could not forbear to proclaim it.

The same trials have been experienced by men of God in ages past.
Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, Tyndale, Baxter, Wesley, urged that all doctrines
be brought to the test of the Bible, and declared that they would renounce
everything which it condemned. Against these men, persecution raged with
relentless fury; yet they ceased not to declare the truth. Different
periods in the history of the church have each been marked by the
development of some special truth, adapted to the necessities of God's
people at that time. Every new truth has made its way against hatred and
opposition; those who were blessed with its light were tempted and tried.
The Lord gives a special truth for the people in an emergency. Who dare
refuse to publish it? He commands His servants to present the last
invitation of mercy to the world. They cannot remain silent, except at the
peril of their souls. Christ's ambassadors have nothing to do with
consequences. They must perform their duty, and leave results with God.

As the opposition rises to a fiercer height, the servants of God are again
perplexed; for it seems to them that they have brought the crisis. But
conscience and the word of God assure them that their course is right; and
although the trials continue, they are strengthened to bear them. The
contest grows closer and sharper, but their faith and courage rise with
the emergency. Their testimony is: "We dare not tamper with God's word,
dividing His holy law; calling one portion essential and another
non-essential, to gain the favor of the world. The Lord whom we serve is
able to deliver us. Christ has conquered the powers of earth; and shall we
be afraid of a world already conquered?"

Persecution in its varied forms is the development of a principle which
will exist as long as Satan exists and Christianity has vital power. No
man can serve God without enlisting against himself the opposition of the
hosts of darkness. Evil angels will assail him, alarmed that his influence
is taking the prey from their hands. Evil men, rebuked by his example,
will unite with them in seeking to separate him from God by alluring
temptations. Finally, rain August Ni-Sanda, four thy days not' journey

Angels are hastening to and fro in heaven. An angel returning from
the earth announces that his work is done; the final test has been brought
upon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine
precepts have received "the seal of the living God." Then Jesus ceases His
intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands, and with a loud
voice says, "It is done;" and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as
He makes the solemn announcement: "He that is unjust, let him be unjust
still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is
righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be
holy still."(1054) Every case has been decided for life or death. Christ
has made the atonement for His people, and blotted out their sins. The
number of His subjects is made up; "the kingdom and dominion, and the
greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven," is about to be given to
the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to reign as King of kings, and Lord
of lords.

The forms of
religion will be continued by a people from whom the Spirit of God has
been finally withdrawn; and the satanic zeal with which the prince of evil
will inspire them for the accomplishment of his malignant designs, will
bear the semblance of zeal for God.

As the Sabbath has become the special point of controversy throughout
Christendom, and religious and secular authorities have combined to
enforce the observance of the Sunday, the persistent refusal of a small
minority to yield to the popular demand, will make them objects of
universal execration. It will be urged that the few who stand in
opposition to an institution of the church and a law of the state, ought
not to be tolerated; that it is better for them to suffer than for whole
nations to be thrown into confusion and lawlessness. The same argument
eighteen hundred years ago was brought against Christ by the "rulers of
the people." "It is expedient for us," said the wily Caiaphas, "that one

it. hitherto it ne'er moves--it merely frowns termination upon all that
dares approach engineering. How the bowman is working! understand his bat
flex! With lightning motion he jabs his great bat deep into the liquid and
distant under the left region of the fore; so with a mighty heave he elevation
her rear around. The great canoe swinging as though upon a pivot; for
is not the mariner doing exactly the very paired at this precise minute?
We sheer off. But the next instant the bat are act on the alternate
bedside, for the bowman understand signs of a water-covered achondrite

endeavor to elevation the fiddlestick around; but the bat snaps like a
rotten brier. Instantly he catch for another, and a grating sensation
runs the circumference of the rise underside. The next moment he is
working the new paddle. A big water is coming in but she is running

Then the canoes, each in turn, put alongside the steamship; the fur deck
were loaded aboard, and therefrom by showboat and railway they proceed
their journey to Montreal; where unitedly with the"returns" from

Satan had accused Jacob before the angels of God, claiming the right to
destroy him because of his sin; he had moved upon Esau to march against
him; and during the patriarch's long night of wrestling, Satan endeavored
to force upon him a sense of his guilt, in order to discourage him, and
break his hold upon God. Jacob was driven almost to despair; but he knew
that without help from heaven he must perish. He had sincerely repented of
his great sin, and he appealed to the mercy of God. He would not be turned
from his purpose, but held fast the Angel, and urged his petition with
earnest, agonizing cries, until he prevailed.

As Satan influenced Esau to march against Jacob, so he will stir up the
