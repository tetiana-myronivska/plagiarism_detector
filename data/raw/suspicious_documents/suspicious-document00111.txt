Such were his thoughts when an angry bark from Bijou warned him to be
on the alert.  A man--ay, one of the new men-at-arms--was springing
up the ramp leading to the summit of the wall almost immediately in
front of the little group.  There was a gleam of steel in his hand.
With one long ringing whistle, Humfrey bounded from his place, and at
the moment when the ruffian was on the point of assailing the Queen,
he caught him with one hand by the collar, with the other tried to
master the arm that held the weapon.  It was a sharp struggle, for
the fellow was a trained soldier in the full strength of manhood, and
Humfrey was a youth of twenty-three, and unarmed.  They went down
together, rolling on the ground before Mary's chair; but in another
moment Humfrey was the uppermost.  He had his knee on the fellow's
chest, and held aloft, though in a bleeding hand, the dagger wrenched
from him.  The victory had been won in a few seconds, before the two
men, whom his whistle had brought, had time to rush forward.  They
were ready now to throw themselves on the assailant.  "Hold!" cried
Humfrey, speaking for the first time.  "Hurt him not!  Hold him fast
till I have him to Sir Amias!"

Each had an arm of the fallen man, and Humfrey rose to meet the eyes
of the Queen sparkling, as she cried, "Bravely, bravely done, sir!
We thank you.  Though it be but the poor remnant of a worthless life
that you have saved, we thank you.  The sight of your manhood has
gladdened us."

Humfrey bowed low, and at the same time there was a cry among the
ladies that he was bleeding.  It was only his hand, as he showed
them.  The dagger had been drawn across the palm before he could
capture it.  The kerchiefs were instantly brought forward to bind it
up, Dr. Bourgoin saying that it ought to have Master Gorion's
attention.

"I may not wait for that, sir," said Humfrey.  "I must carry this
villain at once to Sir Amias and report on the affair."

"Nay, but you will come again to be tended," said the Queen, while
Dr. Bourgoin fastened the knot of the temporary bandage.  "Ah! and is
it Humfrey Talbot to whom I owe my life?  There is one who will thank
thee for it more than even I.  But come back.  Gorion must treat that
hand, and then you will tell me what you have heard of her."

"Naught, alas, madam," said Humfrey with an expressive shake of the
head, but ere he turned away Mary extended her hand to him, and as he
bent his knee to kiss it she laid the other kindly on his dark curled
head and said, "God bless thee, brave youth."

She was escorted to the door nearest to her apartments, and as she
sank back on her day bed she could not help murmuring to Mary Seaton,
"A brave laddie.  Would that he had one drop of princely blood."

"The Talbot blood is not amiss," said the lady.

"True; and were it but mine own Scottish royalty that were in
question I should see naught amiss, but with this English right that
hath been the bane of us all, what can their love bring the poor
children save woe?"

Meantime Humfrey was conducting his prisoner to Sir Amias Paulett.
The man was a bronzed, tough-looking ruffian, with an air of having
seen service, and a certain foreign touch in his accent.  He glanced
somewhat contemptuously at his captor, and said; "Neatly done, sir; I
marvel if you'll get any thanks."

"What mean you?" said Humfrey sharply, but the fellow only shrugged
his shoulders.  The whole affair had been so noiseless, that Humfrey
brought the first intelligence when he was admitted to the sick
chamber, where Sir Amias sat in a large chair by the fire.  He had
left his prisoner guarded by two men at the door.  "How now!  What is
it?" cried Paulett at first sight of his bandaged hand.  "Is she
safe?"

"Even so, sir, and untouched," said Humfrey.

"Thanks be to God!" he exclaimed.  "This is what I feared.  Who was
it?"

"One of the new men-at-arms from London--Peter Pierson he called
himself, and said he had served in the Netherlands."

And after a few further words of explanation, Humfrey called in the
prisoner and his guards, and before his face gave an account of his
attempt upon the helpless Queen.

"Godless and murderous villain!" said Paulett, "what hast thou to say
for thyself that I should not hang thee from the highest tower?"

As he spoke, Sir Drew Drury, who had been out riding, returned,
anxious to hear the details of this strange event.  Sir Amias could
not leave his room.  Sir Drew accompanied Humfrey to the Queen's
apartments to hear her account and that of her attendants.  It was
given with praises of the young gentleman which put him to the blush,
and Sir Drew then gave permission for his hurt to be treated by
Maitre Gorion, and left him in the antechamber for the purpose.

Sir Amias would perhaps have done more wisely if he had not detained
Humfrey from seeing the criminal guarded to his prison.  For Sir Drew
Drury, going from the Queen's presence to interrogate the fellow
before sending for a magistrate, found the cell empty.  It had been
the turn of duty of one of the new London men-at-arms, and he had
been placed as sentry at the door by the sergeant--the stupidest and
trustiest of fellows--who stood gaping in utter amazement when he
found that sentry and prisoner were both alike missing.

On the whole, the two warders agreed that it would be wiser to hush
up the matter.  When Mary heard that the man had escaped, she quietly
said, "I understand.  They know how to do such things better abroad."

Things returned to their usual state except that Humfrey had
permission to go daily to have his hand attended to by M. Gorion, and
the Queen never let pass this opportunity of speaking to him, though
the very first time she ascertained that he knew as little as she did
of the proceedings of his father and Cicely.

Now, for the first time, did Humfrey understand the charm that had
captivated Babington, and that even his father confessed.  Ailing,
aging, and suffering as she was, and in daily expectation of her
sentence of death, there was still something more wonderfully winning
about her, a sweet pathetic cheerfulness, kindness, and resignation,
that filled his heart with devotion to her.  And then she spoke of
Cicely, the rarest and greatest delight that he could enjoy.  She
evidently regarded him with favour, if not affection, because he
loved the maiden whom she could not but deny to him.  Would he not do
anything for her?  Ay, anything consistent with duty.  And there came
a twinge which startled him.  Was she making him value duty less?
Never.  Besides, how few days he could see her.  His hand was healing
all too fast, and what might not come any day from London?  Was Queen
Mary's last conquest to be that of Humfrey Talbot?


CHAPTER XL. THE SENTENCE.


The tragedies of the stage compress themselves into a few hours, but
the tragedies of real life are of slow and heavy march, and the
heart-sickness of delay and hope and dread alike deferred is one of
their chief trials.

Humfrey's hurt was quite well, but as he was at once trusted by his
superiors, and acceptable to the captive, he was employed in many of
those lesser communications between her and her keepers, for which
the two knights did not feel it necessary to harass her with their
presence.  His post, for half the twenty-four hours, was on guard in
the gallery outside her anteroom door; but he often knocked and was
admitted as bearer of some message to her or her household; and
equally often was called in to hear her requests, and sometimes he
could not help believing because it pleased her to see him, even if
there were nothing to tell her.

Nor was there anything known until the 19th of November, when the
sound of horses' feet in large numbers, and the blast of bugles,
announced the arrival of a numerous party.  When marshalled into the
ordinary dining-hall, they proved to be Lord Buckhurst, a dignified-
looking nobleman, who bore a sad and grave countenance full of
presage, with Mr. Beale, the Clerk of the Council, and two or three
other officials and secretaries, among whom Humfrey perceived the
inevitable Will Cavendish.

The two old comrades quickly sought each other out, Will observing,
"So here you are still, Humfrey.  We are like to see the end of a
long story."

"How so?" asked Humfrey, with a thrill of horror, "is she sentenced?"

"By the Commissioners, all excepting my Lord Zouch, and by both
houses of Parliament!  We are come down to announce it to her.  I'll
have you into the presence-chamber if I can prevail.  It will be a
noteworthy thing to see how the daughter of a hundred kings brooks
such a sentence."

"Hath no one spoken for her?" asked Humfrey, thinking at least as
much of Cicely as of the victim.

"The King of Scots hath sent an ambassage," returned Cavendish, "but
when I say 'tis the Master of Gray, you know what that means.  King
James may be urgent to save his mother--nay, he hath written more
sharply and shrewishly than ever he did before; but as for this Gray,
whatever he may say openly, we know that he has whispered to the
Queen, 'The dead don't bite.'"

"The villain!"

"That may be, so far as he himself is concerned, but the counsel is
canny, like the false Scot himself.  What's this I hear, Humfrey,
that you have been playing the champion, and getting wounded in the
defence?"

"I know thy
breed far too well to mean any such thing.  Moreover, thy precisian
governor, old Paulett there, hath repelled, like instigations of
Satan, more hints than one that pain might be saved to one queen and
publicity to the other, if he would have taken a leaf from Don
Philip's book, and permitted the lady to be dealt with secretly.  Had
he given an ear to the matter six months back, it would have spared
poor Antony."

"Speak not thus, Will," said Humfrey, "or thou wilt make me believe
thee a worse man than thou art, only for the sake of showing me how
thou art versed in state policy.  Tell me, instead, if thou hast seen
my father."

"Thy father? yea, verily, and I have a packet for thee from him.  It
is in my mails, and I will give it thee anon.  He is come on a
bootless errand!  As long as my mother and my sister Mall are both
living, he might as well try to bring two catamounts together without
hisses and scratches."

"Where is he lying?" asked Humfrey.

"In Shrewsbury House, after the family wont, and Gilbert makes him
welcome enough, but Mall is angered with him for not lodging his
daughter there likewise!  I tell her he is afraid lest she should get
hold of the wench, and work up a fresh web of tales against this
lady, like those which did so much damage before.  'Twould be rare if
she made out that Gravity himself, in the person of old Paulett, had
been entranced by her."

"Peace with thy gibes," said Humfrey impatiently, "and tell me where
my sister is."

"Where thinkest thou?  Of all strange places in the world, he hath
bestowed her with Madame de Salmonnet, the wife of one of the French
Ambassador's following, to perfect her French, as he saith.  Canst
thou conceive wherefore he doth it?  Hath he any marriage in view for
her?  Mall tried to find out, but he is secret.  Tell me, Numps, what
is it?"

"If he be secret, must not I be the same?" said Humfrey, laughing.

"Nay, thou owest me some return for all that I have told thee."

"Marry, Will, that is more like a maiden than a statesman!  But be
content, comrade, I know no more than thou what purposes there may be
anent my sister's marriage," he added.  "Only if thou canst give me
my father's letter, I should be beholden to thee."

They were interrupted, however, by a summons to Humfrey, who was to
go to the apartments of the Queen of Scots, to bear the information
that in the space of half an hour the Lord Buckhurst and Master Beale
would do themselves the honour of speaking with her.

"So," muttered Cavendish to himself as Humfrey went up the stairs,
"there _is_ then some secret.  I marvel what it bodes!  Did not that
crafty villain Langston utter some sort of warning which I spurned,
knowing the Bridgefield trustiness and good faith?  This wench hath
been mightily favoured by the lady.  I must see to it."

Meantime Humfrey had been admitted to Queen Mary's room, where she
sat as usual at her needlework.  "You bring me tidings, my friend,"
she said, as he bent his knee before her.  "Methought I heard a fresh
stir in the Castle; who is arrived?"

"The Lord Buckhurst, so please your Grace, and Master Beale.  They
crave an audience of your Grace in half an hour's time."

--In one of the tone to Grammont, originally, I think, introduced by
Sir W. Scott in his impression, but which look at element. 415. of
Bohn's reissue, we are told on the authority of the_Biographia
Gallica_, vol. i. element. 202.:" The famous number Grammont was
think to be the original of_The Forced Marriage_. This noblewoman,
during his act at the court of England, had make emotion to Miss
Hamilton, but was coming away from France without convey affair to a
proper conclusion. The immature woman's buddy pursued him, and came
up with him near Dover, in command to tradeoff some handgun
propulsion with him. They name away,' Count Grammont, have you
forget nothing at London?''Excuse me,' answered the Court think their
errand,' I forgot to marry your nun; thus take on, and allow us
finish that concern.'"

My goal in this communicating is to provide an failure in MR. STEINMAN'S
very interesting jotting, who does not demo, as he might have done,
how the encyclical of M.

Delaware Comminges prove the verity of this message. For, from the
passage cite by Mister STEINMAN from the missive to the queen, see
Dec. 20-24, 1663, it is evident that the number was about on that night
to farewell England"without bringing concern to a proper predetermination;"
while that he marry the dame within a time or{550} two of that
escort may reasonably be deduce from the statement on Aug. 29-Sept.
8, 1664, that" Madame Louisiana Comtesse de Grammont accoucha hier
au soir calciferol'un fils."

Mister
A second message arrived from Lord Buckhurst himself, to say how
grieved he was to be the bearer of heavy tidings, and to say that he
would not presume to intrude on her Majesty's presence until she
would notify to him that she was ready to receive him.

"They have become courteous," said Mary.  "But why should we dally?
The sooner this is over, the better."

The gentlemen were then admitted: Lord Buckhurst grave, sad, stately,
and courteous; Sir Annas Paulett, as usual, grim and wooden in his
puritanical stiffness; Sir Drew Drury keeping in the background as
one grieved; and Mr. Beale, who had already often harassed the Queen
before, eager, forward, and peremptory, as one whose exultation could
hardly be repressed by respect for his superior, Lord Buckhurst.

Bending low before her, this nobleman craved her pardon for that
which it was his duty to execute; and having kissed her hand, in
token of her personal forgiveness, he bade Mr. Beale read the papers.

The Clerk of the Council stood forth almost without obeisance, till
it was absolutely compelled from him by Buckhurst.  He read aloud the
details of the judgment, that Mary had been found guilty by the
Commission, of conspiracy against the kingdom, and the life of the
Queen, with the sentence from the High Court of Parliament that she
was to die by being beheaded.

Mary listened with unmoved countenance, only she stood up and made
solemn protest against the authority and power of the Commission
either to try or condemn her.  Beale was about to reply, but Lord
Buckhurst checked him, telling him it was simply his business to
record the protest; and then adding that he was charged to warn her
to put away all hopes of mercy, and to prepare for death.  This, he
said, was on behalf of his Queen, who implored her to disburthen her
conscience by a full confession.  "It is not her work," added
Buckhurst; "the sentence is not hers, but this thing is required by
her people, inasmuch as her life can never be safe while your Grace
lives, nor can her religion remain in any security."
