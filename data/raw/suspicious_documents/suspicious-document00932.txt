    AA236725. Mary A. A little time
    will determine how matters will
    terminate, that is, if the tea comes out.

If it does, I hope
  it may come free of duty, as by that means much trouble and anxiety
will be saved by the agents.

I do assure you they have all been very uneasy, tho' at the same
time determined to do their duty, but in the most prudent & quiet
manner.

  It is now two o'clock, P.M., when
    I received the paper signed Cassius, in which you will find Mr.

L---- R----de handsomely complimented, and yourself severely handled,
on a supposition that you should have spoken words to the import,
as asserted in the paper.

  Mr. R----e's name is not mentioned,
    but there is no doubt but he is the person alluded to, as upon the
arrival of the London ships, who refused to bring the tea.
