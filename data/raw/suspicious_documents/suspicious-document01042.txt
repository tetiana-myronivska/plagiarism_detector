"Ah, on foot!" muttered Grundt, as a not well-conceived apology for
not having saluted the young gentlemen.  "I greet you well, sirs,"
with a bow, most haughtily returned by Ebbo, who was heartily wishing
himself on his mountain.  "Two lusty, well-grown Junkern indeed, to
whom my Martin will be proud to show the humours of Ulm.  A fair good
night, lady!  You will find the old folks right cheery."

Well did Christina know the turn down the street, darkened by the
overhanging brows of the tall houses, but each lower window laughing
with the glow of light within that threw out the heavy mullions and
the circles and diamonds of the latticework, and here and there the
brilliant tints of stained glass sparkled like jewels in the upper
panes, pictured with Scripture scene, patron saint, or trade emblem.
All young housewives do not know that ham or bacon fat may be substituted
for half the shortening called for in many recipes for molasses
cakes (where spices are used) with good results. Also that the grease
rendered from clean fat of chickens, which greatly resembles butter
when tried out and cold, may be combined with an equal quantity of
other shortening in making cakes in which spices are used. The
difference in the taste of cake made from this fat, if rendered sweet
and clean, will not be noticed. Equal parts of ham or bacon fat,
pork chops or sausage fat, combined with butter, are excellent
for frying cornmeal mush, eggs, sweet potatoes, egg bread and
calves' liver.

Also sliced tomatoes have a particularly fine flavor if fried in bacon
fat. Should fat removed from top of stock pot have a flavor of vegetables,
pour boiling water over, strain and stand aside to cool; then
remove the clean cake of fat on top of the water and add to bowl
of drippings.

This is one of the small economies which will, I think, appeal to the
frugal young housewife.

If possible, procure an iron pot for deep frying. After using, strain
the fat remaining, adding sediment in the bottom of cook-pot to
the can of soap fat; then return the clean, strained fat to the
cook pot. Keep in a cool place, closely covered, and if careful not
to scorch the fat.
It may be used over and over again, and croquettes, etc., may be
prepared in a few moments by simply heating the kettle of fat in
which to fry them.

Aunt Sarah frequently filled small glass jars with rendered mutton
suet, scented with violet essence, to be used for chapped lips and
hands.

EGGS--"EIERKUCHEN" OR OMELETTE
For this excellent omelette or "eierkuchen," as Aunt Sarah called
it, she used the following:

3 fresh eggs.
1 cup sweet milk.
3 level tablespoonfuls of flour.

She placed on the range a small fry pan (size of a tea plate),
containing one tablespoonful of butter. She then placed 3 tablespoonfuls
of flour in a bowl, mixed smoothly with a portion of the cup of milk,
then added the three yolks of eggs which had been lightly beaten
and the balance of the milk and a pinch of salt.

Lastly, she stirred in lightly the stiffly-beaten whites of eggs.
Poured all into the warmed fry-pan and placed it in a moderately hot
oven until lightly browned on top. The omelette when cooked should
be light and puffy, and remain so while being served.

Double the omelette together on a hot platter and sprinkle finely
chopped parsley over the top. Serve immediately.

HARD BOILED EGGS
Eggs to be hard boiled should be carefully placed in boiling water
and cooked 15 minutes from the time the water commences to boil
again.Thy work has been more than I then thought
of."

"Ah! and now will you deem it begun--not done!" softly said
Christina, though with too much heartfelt exultation greatly to doubt
that all the world must be satisfied with two such boys, if only Ebbo
would be his true self.

The luxury of the house, the wainscoted and tapestried walls, the
polished furniture, the lamps and candles, the damask linen, the rich
array of silver, pewter, and brightly-coloured glass, were a great
contrast to the bare walls and scant necessaries of Schloss
Adlerstein; but Ebbo was resolved not to expose himself by
admiration, and did his best to stifle Friedel's exclamations of
surprise and delight.  Were not these citizens to suppose that
everything was tenfold more costly at the baronial castle?  And truly
the boy deserved credit for the consideration for his mother, which
made him merely reserved, while he felt like a wild eagle in a
poultry-yard.  It was no small proof of his affection to forbear more
interference with his mother's happiness than was the inevitable
effect of that intuition which made her aware that he was chafing and
ill at ease.  For his sake, she allowed herself to be placed in the
seat of honour, though she longed, as of old, to nestle at her
uncle's feet, and be again his child; but, even while she felt each
acceptance of a token of respect as almost an injury to them, every
look and tone was showing how much the same Christina she had
returned.

In truth, though her life had been mournful and oppressed, it had not
been such as to age her early.  It had been all submission, without
wear and tear of mind, and too simple in its trials for care and
moiling; so the fresh, lily-like sweetness of her maiden bloom was
almost intact, and, much as she had undergone, her once frail health
had been so braced by the mountain breezes, that, though delicacy
remained, sickliness was gone from her appearance.  and how could
Charles de Haldimar, even if his bland nature should survive the
shock, ever bear to look again upon the man who had, however
innocently or unintentionally, deprived him of a brother whom he
adored?

These were the impressions that passed through the minds of the
compassionating officers, as they directed their glance alternately
from the common to the pale and marble-like features of the younger
De Haldimar, who, with parted lips and stupid gaze, continued to
fix his eyes upon the inanimate form of his ill-fated brother, as
if the very faculty of life itself had been for a period suspended.

At length, however, while his companions watched in silence the
mining workings of that grief which they feared to interrupt by
ill-timed observations, even of condolence, the death-like hue,
which had hitherto suffused the usually blooming cheek of the young
officer, was succeeded by a flush of the deepest dye, while his
eyes, swollen by the tide of blood now rushing violently to his
face, appeared to be bursting from their sockets.

The shock was more than his delicate frame, exhausted as it was
by watching and fatigue, could bear. He tottered, reeled, pressed
his hand upon his head, and before any one could render him assistance,
fell senseless on the ramparts.

During the interval between Sir Everard Valletort's exclamation,
and the fall of Charles de Haldimar, the men employed at the grave
had performed their duty, and were gazing with mingled astonishment
and concern, both on the body of their murdered officer, and on the
dumb scene acting around them.

Two of these were now despatched for a litter, with which they
speedily re-appeared. On this Charles de Haldimar, already
delirious with the fever of intense excitement, was carefully
placed, and, followed by Captain Blessington and Lieutenant
Johnstone, borne to his apartment in the small range of buildings
constituting the officers' barracks.

Captain Erskine undertook the disagreeable office of communicating
these distressing events to the governor; and the remainder of the
officers once more hastened to join or linger near their respective
companies, in readiness for the order which it was expected would
be given to despatch a numerous party of the garrison to secure the
body of Captain de Haldimar.

CHAPTER V.

The sun was just rising above the horizon, in all that peculiar
softness of splendour which characterises the early days of autumn
in America, as Captain Erskine led his company across the drawbridge
that communicated with the fort.

It was the first time it had been lowered since the investment of the
garrison by the Indians; and as the dull and rusty chains performed
their service with a harsh and grating sound, it seemed as if an
earnest were given of melancholy boding.

Although the distance to be traversed was small, the risk the party
incurred was great; for it was probable the savages, ever
on the alert, would not suffer them to effect their object unmolested.

It was perhaps singular, and certainly contradictory, that an officer
of the acknowledged prudence and forethought ascribed to the
governor--qualities which in a great degree neutralised his excessive
severity in the eyes of his troops--should have hazarded the chance
of having his garrison enfeebled by the destruction of a part, if
not of the whole, of the company appointed to this dangerous duty;
but with all his severity, Colonel de Haldimar was not without
strong affection for his children.

The feelings of the father, therefore, in a great degree triumphed
over the prudence of the commander; and to shield the corpse of
his son from the indignities which he well knew would be inflicted
on it by Indian barbarity, he had been induced to accede to the
earnest prayer of Captain Erskine, that he might be permitted to
lead out his company for the purpose of securing the body.

Every means were, however, taken to cover the advance, and ensure the
retreat of the detachment.

The remainder of the troops were distributed along the rear of the
ramparts, with instructions to lie flat on their faces until summoned
by their officers from that position; which was to be done only
in the event of close pursuit from the savages.

Their mother was ready to weep for joy.  There was now no drawback to
her bliss, since her son and her uncle had accepted one another; and
she repaired to her own beloved old chamber a happier being than she
had been since she had left its wainscoted walls.

Nay, as she gazed out at the familiar outlines of roof and tower, and
felt herself truly at home, then knelt by the little undisturbed
altar of her devotions, with the cross above and her own patron saint
below in carved wood, and the flowers which the good aunt had ever
kept as a freshly renewed offering, she felt that she was happier,
more fully thankful and blissful than even in the girlish calm of her
untroubled life.  Her prayer that she might come again in peace had
been more than fulfilled; nay, when she had seen her boys kneel
meekly to receive her uncle's blessing, it was in some sort to her as
if the work was done, as if the millstone had been borne up for her,
and had borne her and her dear ones with it.

But there was much to come.  She knew full well that, even though her
sons' first step had been in the right direction, it was in a path
beset with difficulties; and how would her proud Ebbo meet them?


CHAPTER XIII:  THE EAGLETS IN THE CITY


After having once accepted Master Gottfried, Ebbo froze towards him
and Dame Johanna no more, save that a naturally imperious temper now
and then led to fitful stiffnesses and momentary haughtiness, which
were easily excused in one so new to the world and afraid of
compromising his rank.  Add 1 pint of scalded milk, and thicken with
a tablespoonful of flour, mixed with a little cold milk.

Add 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper and salt, and simmer a few
minutes. Just before serving add a cup of whipped cream. Serve
with the soup, small "croutons" of bread.

OYSTER STEW
Rinse a stew-pan with cold water, then put in 1 pint of milk and
let come to a boil.

Heat 15 oysters in a little oyster liquor a few minutes, until the
oysters curl up around the edges, then add the oysters to
one-half the hot milk, add a large tablespoonful of butter, season
well with salt and pepper, and when serving the stew add the half
pint of boiling hot milk remaining. This quantity makes two small
stews. Serve crackers and pickled cabbage. When possible use a mixture
of sweet cream and milk for an oyster stew instead of all milk. An
old cook told Mary she always moistened half a teaspoonful of
cornstarch and added to the stew just before removing from the range
to cause it to have a creamy consistency.

CLAM BROTH
Clam broth may be digested usually by the most delicate stomach.
It can be bought in cans, but the young housewife may like to
know how to prepare it herself. Strain the juice from one-half dozen
clams and save.

Remove objectionable parts from clams, cut in small pieces, add 1/2
pint of cold water and the clam juice, let cook slowly about 10
minutes, strain and season with pepper and salt, a little butter
and milk, and serve hot.

TURKEY SOUP
Take broken-lip bones and undesirable pieces of roast turkey, such
as neck, wings and left-over pieces of bread filling, put in stew-pot,
cover with water, add pieces of celery, sliced onion and parsley,
cook several hours, strain, and to the strained liquor add a couple
tablespoonfuls of boiled rice, season with salt and pepper and serve.

Some of the cold turkey might also be cut in small pieces and added
to the soup.

CREAM OF PEA SOUP
Cook quarter peck of green peas until very tender, reserve
one-half cup, press the remainder through a sieve with the water in
which they were boiled. Season with salt and pepper. Mix 1 tablespoonful
of flour, 1 tablespoonful of butter with 1 cup of hot milk. Mix flour
smooth with a little cold milk before heating it. Cook all together
a few minutes, then add the one cup of peas reserved. If soup is too
thick add a small quantity of milk or water.

TOMATO SOUP
One quart of canned tomatoes, 1 tablespoonful sugar, 1 onion, and
a sprig of parsley, cut fine, and 1 carrot and 2 cloves. Stew until
soft enough to mash through a fine, wire sieve. Place one quart of
sweet milk on the stove to boil. Mix 1 large tablespoonful of
cornstarch smooth, with a little cold milk, and stir into the hot
milk. Add 1 large tablespoonful of butler and 1/4 teaspoonful (good
measure) of soda. Let cook one minute, until it thickens, add 1
teaspoonful of salt. Do not add the milk to the strained tomatoes
until ready to serve. Then serve at once.Lessons in music and singing were gladly accepted by both lads, and
from their uncle's carving they could not keep their hands.  Ebbo had
begun by enjoining Friedel to remember that the work that had been
sport in the mountains would be basely mechanical in the city, and
Friedel as usual yielded his private tastes; but on the second day
Ebbo himself was discovered in the workshop, watching the magic touch
of the deft workman, and he was soon so enticed by the perfect
appliances as to take tool in hand and prove himself not unadroit in
the craft.  Friedel however excelled in delicacy of touch and grace
and originality of conception, and produced such workmanship that
Master Gottfried could not help stroking his hair and telling him it
was a pity he was not born to belong to the guild.

"I cannot spare him, sir," cried Ebbo; "priest, scholar, minstrel,
artist--all want him."

"What, Hans of all streets, Ebbo?" interrupted Friedel.

"And guildmaster of none," said Ebbo, "save as a warrior; the rest
only enough for a gentleman!  For what I am thou must be!"

But Ebbo did not find fault with the skill Friedel was bestowing on
his work--a carving in wood of a dove brooding over two young eagles-
-the device that both were resolved to assume.  When their mother
asked what their lady-loves would say to this, Ebbo looked up, and
with the fullest conviction in his lustrous eyes declared that no
love should ever rival his motherling in his heart.  For truly her
tender sweetness had given her sons' affection a touch of romance,
for which Master Gottfried liked them the better, though his wife
thought their familiarity with her hardly accordant with the
patriarchal discipline of the citizens.

The youths held aloof from these burghers, for Master Gottfried
wisely desired to give them time to be tamed before running risk of
offence, either to, or by, their wild shy pride; and their mother
contrived to time her meetings with her old companions when her sons
were otherwise occupied.  His own surprise and disappointment may
be easily conceived, when, in the form of the recumbent being who
seemed to engross universal attention, he recognised, by the fair
and streaming hair, and half exposed bosom, the unfortunate being
whom, only two hours previously, he had spurned from his
feet in the costume of her own sex, and reduced, by the violence
of her grief, to almost infantine debility.
Question succeeded question to those around, but without eliciting
any clue to the means by which this mysterious disguise had been
effected. No one had been aware, until the truth was so singularly and
suddenly revealed, the supposed drummer was any other than one of the
lads attached to the grenadiers; and as for the other facts, they
spoke too plainly to the comprehension of the governor to need
explanation. Once more, however, the detachment was called to order.
Halloway struck his hand violently upon his brow, kissed the wan
lips of his still unconscious wife, breathing, as he did so, a half
murmured hope she might indeed be the corpse she appeared. He then
raised himself from the earth with a light and elastic vet firm
movement, and resumed the place he had previously occupied, where,
to his surprise, he beheld a second victim bound, and, apparently,
devoted to the same death.

When the eyes of the two unhappy men met, the governor closely
watched the expression of the countenance of each; but although the
Canadian started on beholding the soldier, it might be merely
because he saw the latter arrayed in the garb of death, and followed
by the most unequivocal demonstrations of a doom to which he himself
was, in all probability, devoted. As for Halloway, his look betrayed
neither consciousness nor recognition; and though too proud to
express complaint or to give vent to the feelings of his heart,
his whole soul appeared to be absorbed in the unhappy partner
of his luckless destiny. Presently he saw her borne, and in the
same state of insensibility, in the arms of Captain Erskine and
Lieutenant Leslie, towards the hut of his fellow prisoner, and he
heard the former officer enjoin the weeping girl, Babette, to whose
charge they delivered her over, to pay every attention to her her
situation might require.

How the two lads admired and gazed, caring far less for their
own new and noble attire!  Friedel was indeed somewhat concerned that
the sword by his side was so much handsomer than that which Ebbo
wore, and which, for all its dinted scabbard and battered hilt, he
was resolved never to discard.

It was a festival of brilliant joy.  Wreaths of flowers hung from the
windows; rich tapestries decked the Dome Kirk, and the relics were
displayed in shrines of wonderful costliness of material and beauty
of workmanship; little birds, with thin cakes fastened to their feet,
were let loose to fly about the church, in strange allusion to the
event of the day; the clergy wore their most gorgeous robes; and the
exulting music of the mass echoed from the vaults of the long-drawn
aisles, and brought a rapt look of deep calm ecstasy over Friedel's
sensitive features.  The beggars evidently considered a festival as a
harvest-day, and crowded round the doors of the cathedral.  As the
Lady of Adlerstein came out leaning on Ebbo's arm, with Friedel on
her other side, they evidently attracted the notice of a woman whose
thin brown face looked the darker for the striped red and yellow silk
kerchief that bound the dark locks round her brow, as, holding out a
beringed hand, she fastened her glittering jet black eyes on them,
and exclaimed, "Alms! if the fair dame and knightly Junkern would
hear what fate has in store for them."

"We meddle not with the future, I thank thee," said Christina, seeing
that her sons, to whom gipsies were an amazing novelty, were in
extreme surprise at the fortune-telling proposal.

At that moment Captain Erskine, attracted by the sudden halt produced
by the falling of the body, came quickly up to the front.

"What is the meaning of all this, Cassidy?"

he sternly demanded of the sergeant; "why is this halt without my
orders, and how comes the body here?"

"Carter stumbled against a root, sir, and the body rolled over upon
the ground."

"And was the body to roll back again?" angrily rejoined his captain.--"What
mean ye, fellows, by standing there; quick, replace it upon the
litter, and mind this does not occur again."
"They say, sir," said the sergeant, respectfully, as the men proceeded
to their duty, "that it is not Captain de Haldimar after all, but
an Ingian."

"Not Captain de Haldimar! are ye all mad? and have the Indians, in
reality, turned your brains with fear?"
What, however, was his own surprise, and that of Lieutenant
Johnstone, when, on a closer examination of the corpse, which the men
had now placed with its face uppermost, they discovered the
bewildering fact that it was not, indeed, Captain de Haldimar who
lay before them, but a stranger, dressed in the uniform of that
officer.

There was no time to solve, or even to dwell on the singular mystery;
for the Indians, though now retired, might be expected to rally and
renew the attack.

Once more, therefore, the detachment moved forward; the officers
dropping as before to the rear, to watch any movements of the enemy
should he re-appear.

Nothing, however, occurred to interrupt their march; and in a few minutes
the heavy clanking sound of the chains of the drawbridge, as it
was again raised by its strong pullies, and the dull creaking sound
of the rusty bolts and locks that secured the ponderous gate,
announced the detachment was once more safely within the fort.

While the wounded men were being conveyed to the hospital, a group,
comprising almost all the officers of the garrison, hastened to
meet Captain Erskine and Lieutenant Johnstone. Congratulations
on the escape of the one, and compliments, rather than condolences,
on the accident of the other, which the arm en echarpe denoted to
be slight, were hastily and warmly proffered. These felicitations
were the genuine ebullitions of the hearts of men who really felt
a pride, unmixed with jealousy, in the conduct of their fellows;
and so cool and excellent had been the manner in which Captain Erskine
had accomplished his object, that it had claimed the undivided admiration
of all who had been spectators of the affair, and had, with the aid
of their telescopes, been enabled to follow the minutest movements
of the detachment.

"By heaven!" he at length replied, his chest swelling with gratified
pride at the warm and generous approval of his companions, "this more
than repays me for every risk.
After the lengthy meal, the tables were removed, the long gallery was
occupied by musicians, and Master Gottfried crossed the hall to tell
his eldest grandnephew that to him he should depute the opening of
the dance with the handsome bride of the Rathsherr, Ulrich Burger.
Ebbo blushed up to the eyes, and muttered that he prayed his uncle to
excuse him.

"So!" said the old citizen, really displeased; "thy kinsman might
have proved to thee that it is no derogation of thy lordly dignity.
I have been patient with thee, but thy pride passes--"

"Sir," interposed Friedel hastily, raising his sweet candid face with
a look between shame and merriment, "it is not that; but you forget
what poor mountaineers we are.  " Dear Sir;--I affront am I you to of

youths, "she can tread a measure.  And, after marking us, you may try
your success with the Rathsherrinn."

During a temporary truce, and while Ponteac was holding forth
proposals for an ultimate and durable peace, a game of lacrosse
was arranged by him to take place simultaneously on the common or
clearing on which rested the forts of Michilimackinac and
Detroit.
The better to accomplish their object, the guns of the warriors
had been cut short and given to their women, who were instructed to
conceal them under their blankets, and during the game, and seemingly
without design, to approach the drawbridge of the fort."Is it not beautiful to see the motherling?" said Friedel to his
brother; "she sails like a white cloud in a soft wind.  And he stands
grand as a stag at gaze."

"Like a malapert peacock, say I," returned Ebbo; "didst not see,
Friedel, how he kept his eyes on her in church?  and boy honour but

"Then go and do it, since better may not be."

"Nay, but it should be thou."

"Who will know which of us it is?  I hated his presumption too much
to mark his antics."

Put the yolks on the cold plate, add 1/4 teaspoonful of salt, the same
of mustard. Mix well and then, with a fork, stir or blend the olive
oil into it drop by drop.

After about 1/2 cup of oil has been blended in, add lemon juice,
a drop or two at a time. Then more oil, and when it becomes very thick
add more lemon juice. A pint or even more oil may, with care, be
blended into two yolks. Care must be taken not to mix oil in too fast,
or the egg and oil will separate, making a mixture resembling curdled
custard.
