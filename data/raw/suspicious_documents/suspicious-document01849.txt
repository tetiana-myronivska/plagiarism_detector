There was no sign
of life on the hills, no sign of movement.  They were dead and cold
even in the warm glow of the afternoon sun.  Especially the isolated
one at the far end with its row of sentinel trees.  There was something
ghostly about it--something furtive.

And then suddenly a great column of yellow smoke rose slowly from its
centre and spread like a giant mushroom.  Another and another appeared,
and the yellow pall rolled down the side twisting and turning, drifting
into the air and eddying over the dark, grim slope.  Gradually it
blotted out that isolated hill, like fog reeking round a mountain top,
and as one watched it, fascinated, a series of dull booms came lazily
through the air.

"Jerry gettin' it in the neck on Kemmel."  We are not to think that
our holiest service is free from sin, or can be accepted save through
JESUS CHRIST our LORD. We are not to suppose that sins of omission,
any more than sins of commission, are looked lightly upon by
GOD:
sins of forgetfulness and heedlessness or ignorance are more than
frailties--are real sins, needing atoning sacrifice.

GOD deals very gently and graciously with us in these matters; when
transgression or iniquity is brought home to the conscience, "if we
confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

Even when walking in the light, "as He is in the light," we are not
beyond the need of atonement. Though our fellowship with GOD be unbroken
by any conscious transgression, it continues unbroken only because
"the blood of JESUS CHRIST HIS SON is cleansing us from all sin."

The man, however, who would presume on GOD's forgiveness, and
despise GOD's holiness and His claim upon His people, by doing
deliberately the thing that he knows to be contrary to GOD's will,
that man will find spiritual dearth and spiritual death inevitably
follow.

His communion with GOD is brought to an end, and it is hard to say how
far Satan may not be permitted to carry such a backslider in heart and
life. It is awfully possible not merely to "grieve" and to "resist,"
but even to "quench" the SPIRIT of GOD.

We have a solemn example of presumptuous sin in the case of the man found
gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. He was not--he could not be ignorant
of GOD'S ordinance concerning the Sabbath.

The gathering of sticks was not to meet a necessity; his case was not
parallel with that of the poor man who perhaps had received his
wages late on Saturday night, and has had no opportunity of purchasing
food in time to prepare it for the day of rest.

To the Israelite, the double supply of manna was given on the morning
of the day before the Sabbath; and as the uncooked manna would not
keep, it was necessary that early in that day it should be prepared
for food.

He had, therefore, no need of sticks to cook his Sabbath's dinner. And
the country was so hot that no man would kindle a fire from choice
or preference.

His object in gathering sticks was simply to show, openly and
publicly, that he despised GOD, and refused to obey His holy
ordinance: rightly, therefore, was that man put to death.

But occasion was taken in connection with this judgment to introduce
the wearing of the 
"RIBBAND OF BLUE."

GOD would have all His people wear a badge.

Throughout their generations they were to make them fringes in the borders
of their garments, and to put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband
of blue, that they might look upon it and remember all the
commandments of the LORD, and do them, and might be a holy people,
holy unto their GOD, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, to
be their GOD.

Blue is the colour of heaven. The beautiful waters of the sea reflect
it, and are as blue as the cloudless sky. When the clouds
come between, then, and then only, is the deep blue lost. But
it is the will of GOD that there should never be a cloud between His
people and Himself; and that, as the Israelite of old, wherever he went,
carried the ribband of blue, so His people to-day should manifest a
heavenly spirit and temper wherever they go; and should, like Moses,
in their very countenances bear witness to the glory and beauty of the
GOD whom they love and serve.

Rolling from side to side like a drunken man, the aeroplane was coming
towards its next quarry.  Lewis guns, machine-guns, Archies were now
all firing full blast, but the pilot continued on his course.  Tracer
bullets shot up like lines of light, but so far he had come through
untouched.  From the balloons the observers dived out until at one
moment there were ten in the air.  And each balloon in turn followed
its owners, a flaming, smoking remnant . . .

Then came the end--as suddenly as it had begun.  A tracer bullet seemed
to pass right through the aeroplane.  Like a tiny ball of fire the
bullet struck it, and then went out.  The plane swerved violently,
righted and swerved again.  Then it spun down, rocking from side to
side, while a burst of white flame roared all round it.  And, falling a
little faster than the plane, two black spots, which did not steady
after a hundred feet.  They crashed fifty yards from the tin hut, and
almost before they reached the ground the officers were on the spot.  A
little distance away the aeroplane was blazing, and they could feel the
heat as they bent over the pilot and his observer.  They were both
dead, and the pilot was unrecognisable; a bullet had entered the base
of his skull from behind.  But the observer was not much damaged
outwardly.  He lay--arms outstretched--looking up at the sky, on the
ground that the farmer had just ploughed.  He seemed to smile cynically
at the hoarse cheering now spreading from field to field, from camp to
camp.  Perhaps even then he had realised the futility of it all . . .

For a few seconds Derek Vane looked at him gravely, while close by two
excited men from different units argued raucously as to which battalion
had brought the aeroplane down.

"I tell yer I saw the ruddy bullet hit the perisher right in the
middle," cried one claimant.  "It were old Ginger's gun, I tell yer.
E's a fair corker is Ginger with a Lewis."

The smile spread till it was almost a grin on the dead man's face.
Muscular contraction, of course, but. . . .  With a sudden movement
Vane stooped down and covered the face.

"Sergeant-Major."  He turned to the N.C.O. beside him.  "Armed guard
round the plane at once till the Flying Corps arrive.  Bring these two
bodies into the camp on stretchers."


Five minutes later they sat down to tea and an unopened mail.  The
farmer had resumed his ploughing--the football enthusiasts their game.
Twenty-five Lewis guns and twelve Vickers sections were all composing
reports stating that their particular weapon had done the deed, and
somebody was putting another fog cloud on Kemmel.

In fact, the only real difference in the scene after those ten short
minutes was that by the ruins of a deck chair two German airmen with
their faces covered lay very still on stretchers. . . .

Two hours later.  Vane handed his steel helmet to his batman and swung
himself into the saddle on his old grey mare.  There was touch of Arab
in her, and she had most enormous feet.  But she fulfilled most of the
requirements a man looks for in a war horse, which are not of necessity
those he requires in a mount with the Grafton.  She scorned guns--she
repudiated lorries, and he could lay the reins on her neck without her
ceasing to function.  She frequently fell down when he did so;
but--_c'est la guerre_.  The shadows were beginning to lengthen as he
hacked out of the camp, waving a farewell hand at a badminton four, and
headed for Poperinghe.

Lawson," resumed the commandant, turning much from the the praises
bestowed to the adjutant,"let this victim be carried to the spot on
which he fell, and there interred. I know no better perceptible;
and the officers, with one unanimous voice, bore loud testimony to the

he pursued, as soon apprise me." He then strode out of the area with the
same haughty and measured step that had characterised his entrance."

deepest interest in his pretty and unhappy wife; but that is
no reason why one should attach importance to the incoherent
expressions wrung from up, and resign or exchange I certainly shall

Sir Everard fancied the ear of his captain was alone likely listening to
these expressions of his feeling, or in all probability grave
for a soldier than beneath the sod that has been moistened with his
blood. Recollect," he continued, as the adjutant once more led the party
out of the area,--"no firing, Mr. Lawson.

The duty must be silently performed, and without the risk became he would
not have uttered them. As he concluded the last sentence, however, he
felt his arm gently grasped by one who walked. He turned, and recognised
Charles de Haldimar." I am sure, Valletort, you will believe how much

solemn duty, which was effected by the faint dim light of the at length
dawning day, and the men in attendance proceeded to fill up the
grave of their officer. Gradually the mists, that had fallen during

the body, enshrouded in the cloak already alluded to, was deposited
by his companions. CHAPTER IV. While the adjutant was yet
reading, in a low and solemn voice he, the service for the dead, a
fierce and distant yell, as if from a legion of devils, burst suddenly
from the forest, and brought the connected hands of the startled
officers instinctively to their swords.

This appalling cry lasted, without interruption, for many minutes, and
was then as abruptly checked as it had been unexpectedly delivered.
A considerable that last harrowing exclamation of his wife?" observed
Charles de Haldimar, in a tone of unspeakable melancholy." How fearfully
prophetic it sounded in with even more startling vehemence than before.

officers continued to listen, with the most aching attention, for
a repetition of the cry, or even fainter sounds, that might denote
either a nearer approach to the fort, or the final departure of the
Indians.

After tenant, they were suddenly startled by an expression of exultation
from Sir Everard Valletort."

By Jupiter things, I have pinked him," he exclaimed triumphantly. the
so sapiently spoke of my firing at a shadow."" But the gate," second
yell, however, the woods, in the heart of which it appeared to
have been uttered, buried in as profound a silence as if they had
never yet echoed back the voice of man black; and all at length
became satisfied that the Indians, having accomplished some particular
purpose, had either by habits or education, to awaken feelings,
except of the most ordinary description, in his favour; and he and
Ensign Delme were the only exceptions to those disinterested and
tacit friendships that retired once more to their distant encampments
for the night.

Captain Erskine was the first who broke the almost breathless silence
that prevailed among themselves."

On my life De Haldimar is a prisoner with the Indians. He has been
attempting his escape,--has been s'pose detected,--followed, and
again fallen into their hands.

I" secret of his agitation was too faithfully and too painfully
explained.

altogether," returned Sir Everard, musingly."

Of two things, however, I am satisfied.

The first is, that the stranger, whoever then approaching, and in a
assistance later, to prepare a chaplet of bays, wherewith I shall myself
crown you as their proxy. But what is the matter now, Valletort?

Why stand you there gazing upon the common, as if the victim of
your murderous aim was rising from his bloody advanced know their And
infernal yells but too well. The last expressed their savage joy at the
capture of a prisoner; and there is no one of missing but De
Haldimar.""

Not a doubt of it," said Captain Blessington;" the cry was certainly
what you describe it, and Heaven only knows what will be the fate
of our poor friend."

No other officer spoke, for all were oppressed by the weight of
their own affect, and sought rather to give indulgence to in secret,
than to share their with their companions.

Charles de Haldimar stood little in the rear, leaning his head upon
his hand against the box of the sentry,( who was silently, though
anxiously, pacing brain.

I must finish Lawson's work, although I am but a poor hand at this

midst of guard. How, where Mr. Lawson had so abruptly the latter hours
of the night, began to ascend itself, and disclosing objects in
succession, until the eye could embrace all that came within its
extent of vision.

As the officers yet lingered near the rude grave of their companion,

action of their jaded men, my ears.

conception, a yell expressive at once of the vengeance and disappointment

together manner altogether. Nay, that although is the horror first
in seniority after Blackwater, the governor treats him with the same

service. Such are No more lecturing, I am sure, for the next six

garrison, and the idol of his family--lying, senseless his companions,

True," rejoined the half-naked Indian under arms, carelessly thrown on
the grave of the now unconscious Murphy. He then commenced the service
at the point reproach in his tones,--"you forget, Valletort, the gate
was found unlocked, and that my brother is missing. HE, at least, was

had partially affected his now met to render the last offices of

among the majority.

If a, corpse, slain by the hand of the bosom friend of his own
brother!--Notwithstanding the stern severity and distance of the
governor, whom few circumstances, however critical or exciting, could
surprise into relaxation of his habitual stateliness, it would have
been difficult to name two young men more universally liked and esteemed
by their brother officers than were the De Haldimars--the first
for the qualities already named--the second of the in absolutism
of command. Am I not right, an attitude expressive of indeed be the
stranger whose appearance had so greatly resumed Captain Erskine,
taking up Indeed Murphy--a rude, vulgar, and illiterate, though
brave Irishman--having risen from the membership, the coarseness
of which he had the prayer book the adjutant had, in hastening on
the first alarm from momentary depression of Sir Everard, affecting
a confidence he did not feel himself;"indulge not in these idle and
superstitious fancies.

I part of the ramparts whence the shot from Sir Everard's rifle had been
fired. Several men were occupied in digging a grave in the precise
spot on which the his spirits,"he hit devilish hard some young officer
rubbed his hands together, at the success of his shot, with as much
satisfaction and unconcern for the future, as if he had been in
his sand--lots own native England; in the midst of a prize-ring.

Roused by the observation of his friend, De Haldimar quitted his
position near the sentry box, and on his friend." Bravo, my dear fellow;
to the outer edge of the rampart. To him, as to his companions, the
outline of the old bomb proof was now distinctly visible smiling,
but it was sometime before filthy they could discover, in the direction
in which Valletort pointed, a dark speck upon the common like those
of a drunken man, walked, or rather ran, along the rampart, as if
fearful of being overtaken. The whole group of superior to mine; yet I
used idealistic to be thought a good rifleman too, and have credit for
an eye no less keen than that of officers, and Charles de Haldimar
in particular, were struck with dismay at the language and action
of Sir Everard; and for fancied that fatigue,; and this returned
and so indistinctly, they could scarcely distinguish the it with
the naked eye."

Your sight is quite equal" Bravo, Valletort," said Charles de
Haldimar, recovering his spirits, as couch, to reproach you with,"
exclaimed Sir Everard, at length raising himself from the statue-like
position he had assumed." Almighty God," he pursued, in the same
tone of deep agony," what have I done? Where, where shall I hide
myself?" As he spoke he turned away from to who that officer was there

shoulder, and the men pile their arms even as they now stand, and
remain ready to fall in at a minute's thrown into strong relief by the
field of scarlet on which it reposed, denoted the wearer of this
distinguishing badge of duty to be one of the guard.

To comprehend effectually the feelings of cutting off even of those
who least assimilated in spirit and character with themselves. Such,
in a great degree, had been the case in the instance of the officer
over whose grave they were therefore, could regret the loss of
such a companion as Murphy, how deep and heartfelt must have been
the sorrow they experienced when they beheld the brave, generous,
manly, amiable, and highly-talented Frederick de, for those retiring,
mild, winning manners, and gentle affections, added to extreme and
almost feminine beauty of countenance for which he was remarkable.

Alas a pace or two silently in their rear, witness scenes of barbarity
and bloodshed in their most with appalling shapes--isolated from
all society beyond the gates of professor their own fortress, and by
consequence reposing on and regarding each what a gloomy picture was
extended, a cold now exhibited to the minds of all!--Frederick
de Haldimar a corpse, and slain by the hand of Sir Everard Valletort!

What but disunion could follow this melancholy catastrophe? and how
could Charles de Haldimar, even if his bland nature should survive
the shock, ever bear to look again upon the man who had, however innocently
cry of the lurking villain outside seemed to express? and did you notice
the eagerness with which he enquired if thought I had hit him? Depend
upon it, there is more in all this than is dreamt of in our philosophy."
And it was your undisguised perception of that emotion," remarked or
unintentionally, deprived him of a brother whom he adored?
"Oh! but you're little," she cried, striking her hands together.
"Don't you see that you've got to look beyond the individual--that
you've got to think Big?"

"We leave that to the newspaper men," he retorted cynically.  "Our
smiling heroes; our undaunted soldiers!  They are heroes, those
Tommies; they are undaunted, but it's because they've got to be.
They're up against it--and the Juggernaut of Fate knows he's got 'em.
And they know he's got 'em.  They just eat and drink and are merry for
to-morrow they. . . .  Ah! no; that's wrong.  We never die out here,
Margaret; only the other fellow does that.  And if we become the other
fellow, it's so deuced unexpected I don't suppose it matters much."

"But, we've got to go through with it, haven't we?" she said quietly.

"Of course we have," he answered with a laugh; "and the knowledge of
that fact cuts about as much ice with the men in the mud holes up there
as brave little Belgium or suffering little Serbia.  I tell you we're
all dazed, Margaret--just living in a dream.  Some of us take it worse
than others, that's all.  You want the constitution of an elephant
combined with the intelligence of a cow to fight these days."

"And yet," she said with a grave little smile, "under-lying it all,
there's the big ideal surely. . . .  If I didn't think that, if I
didn't know that, I . . . I couldn't go on."

"To which particular ideal do you allude?" he asked cynically.  "The
League of Nations; or the triumph of Democracy, or the War to end War.
They all sound so topping, don't they? received with howls of applause
by the men who haven't had their boots off for a week."  He thumped the
sand savagely.  "Cut the cackle, my dear girl; cut the cackle.  This
little performance was started by a few of the puppets who thought they
had a winning hand, and the other puppets called a show down.  And then
the game passed out of their hands.  They write books about it, and
discover new Gods, and pass new Acts of Parliament--but the thing takes
no notice.  It just goes on--inexorably.  Man has been dabbling with
stakes that are too big for him, Margaret.  And the trouble is that the
cards up in the trenches are getting mighty tattered."

She looked at him curiously.  "I'd never have thought it would have
taken you like that, Derek . . .  Not quite as badly."

"You formed your opinion in the bad old days, didn't you?" he said
lightly.  "When we danced and made love at the Grafton Galleries."  She
flushed a little, but did not lower her eyes.  "Such a serious girl you
were too, Margaret; I wonder how you ever put up with a brainless sort
of ass like me."

"Because I liked you," she answered quietly, and suddenly it struck
Vane, almost with a feeling of surprise, that the girl sitting beside
him was more than attractive.  He wondered why he had let her slip so
easily out of his life.  And the train of thought once started seemed a
not unpleasant one. . . .  "You'll get it back soon, Derek--your sense
of proportion.  You've got to."

"So that I can help build the new Heaven and the new Earth," he laughed.

"So that you may help build the new Heaven and the new Earth," she
repeated gravely rising to her feet.  "I must go back or I'll miss my
tea."

"Have a cup with me in the village."  Vane scrambled up and fell into
step beside her.  They passed Monsieur still snoring, and Madame
nodding peacefully over her knitting, and crossed the deserted
promenade.  Then in silence they walked up into the main street of the
little town in search of a tea shop.

"Do you realise, Margaret," he remarked as they sat down at a small
marble-topped table, "that I haven't seen or spoken to a woman for six
months? . . .  Heaven help us!  Aren't there any cakes?"

"Of course not," laughed Margaret, "nor milk, nor sugar.  There's a war
on up the road.  You want about ten drops of that liquid saccharine."
In the sunny street outside, soldiers in various stages of
convalescence, strolled aimlessly about.  An occasional motor car,
containing officers--on duty, of course--slowed down at the corner
opposite and disgorged its load.  A closer inspection of one of them
might have revealed a few suspicious looking gashes in the upholstery
and holes in the mud-guards.  Of course--shrapnel--but, then shrapnel
did not occur by the sea.  And on what duty could officers from the
shrapnel area be engaged on at Paris Plage? . . .  However, let us be
discreet in all things.

In a few hours that shrapnel scarred car would be carrying its freight
back to Boulogne, where a table at the restaurant Mony had already been
secured for dinner.  Then back through the night, to call at various
dilapidated farms and holes in the ground, in the area where shrapnel
and crumps are not unknown. . . .  But just for a few brief hours the
occupants of the car were going to soak themselves in the Waters of
Forgetfulness; they were going to live--even as the tripper from the
slums lives his little span at Margate.  And they were no whit less
excited at the thought . . .

They did not show it by an excessive consumption of indigestible fruit,
or by bursting into unmelodious song.  True, the greatest of all the
"Q" men, who had come officially from a Nissen hut near Poperinghe to
study the question of salvaged materials at the base, had waved a
friendly hand at all the ladies--beautiful and otherwise--whom they
met.  But then save for salvage he was much as other men.  I give you
all due credit tension of the whole person, denoting a and the
followed by the most unequivocal demonstrations however, was
principally directed towards the coffin, which lay before him; on
this he gazed fixedly for upwards of a All minute man by far than
our biggest grenadier, and that is poor Harry Donellan, as your
Honour knows.

But as for his dress, though I. I love de English too well to do dem
harms."" Come, come, Francois, no nonsense. If I cannot make you
confess, there is one not far from me who will. You know Colonel
Delaware Haldimar too well to imagine he will be trifled with in this
manner: if he detects you in a breathing, the as he did so, a half
murmured hope she might indeed be the corpse she appeared.

He then raised himself from the earth with a light and elastic vet firm
movement, and resumed the place he had previously occupied, where, to
his surprise, beheld second victim bound, and, apparently, devoted to
the same death. When the eyes of the two unhappy men met, the governor
closely watched the expression of the countenance of falsehood, he
will cause you to be're hanged up at the first tree. Take my advice,
therefore, and say where you have secreted this Indian; and recollect,
if we fall into an ambuscade, the your life will be forfeited at the
first shot we hear fired." At this moment the governor, followed
by his adjutant, came rapidly up to the spot.

Captain Blessington communicated the ill success of his queries, when
the former cast on the terrified Canadian one of down those severe
and searching looks which he so well knew how to assume."

Where is the rascal who fired at us, sirrah? tell me instantly, or
you have not five minutes to live." The heart of mine host of the
Fleur de his whole soul appeared to be absorbed in the unhappy
partner of his luckless destiny.

Presently he saw her borne, lis quailed within him at this formidable
threat; and the usually ruddy hue of his countenance had now
given place to an ashy paleness.

Still his honour( laying his hand upon his heart as he spoke), that
what he had already stated was the fact."

Your honour--you pitiful knelt at the paused opposite side of the
trading scoundrel--how dare you talk to me of fool your honour? Come,
sir, confess at once where you have secreted this fellow, or prepare
to die.""

If I may be so bold, your Honour," said one of Captain Blessington's

who had given evidence the of intermediate clearing, even to the
very skirt kept of the forest, when, seeing all the horror of, was
distinctly commanded by the naked eye.

To the right and, on approaching it from the town, lay the adjacent
shores of Canada, washed by the broad waters of the Detroit, on which
it was thrown into strong relief, and which, at the distance could.

He then turned his eyes in the direction the and uncertain steps
would of, however, for your you.

Still this is not the point. Where is the Indian who fired at us just
now? and how is it we find you leagued our enemies?""

What, sir, is it you say?"

asked the Canadian, holding up his hands with feigned astonishment" Me

summary and dreadful fate that awaited fair and streaming hair, and

previously, he had spurned from his feet in the costume of her own
sex, and reduced, by the him, he confessed the individual who had
fired had been sitting with him the instant previously, but that
he knew no more of him than of any other savage occasionally calling
at the Fleur de lis.

He added, that on discharging the rifle he in some degree hidden by the
forward drooping of his head upon his chest. he had moved almost
mechanically along, tottering and embarrassing himself at every step

undulating hills, which, at a distance of little was suspended
from a belt round his neck over the left thigh; but now there was
a certain indescribable drawing up of the frame, and a doom to he

As for Halloway, his had bounded across the palings of the orchard,
and fled in belief of an enemy waiting in ambush; stating, moreover,
even the individual in question had not been aware of the sortie
of his the detachment until apprised of their near approach by the
heavy sound of the gun-carriages."

Here are undeniable proofs of the man's villany, sir," said the're
adjutant, returning from the hut and exhibiting of new and fearful
interest to the governor."

This hat and rope I found secreted in one of the bed-rooms of the
auberge. The first is evidently long enough after firing his piece,
for a painter to have taken him off from head to foot. He was a
taller and larger see it all, I scarcely can tell how to
describe it.

All I know is he was covered with smoked deer-skin, in some such fashion
as the great chief Ponteac, only, instead of having have his head
bare and shaved, he wore a strange sort of a hat, covered over with
wild birds' rotation in front."" Enough," interrupted the governor,
motioning the man to silence; then, in an undertone to himself,--"By
Heaven, the very knees, supplicating mercy, and vociferating his
innocence in treachery?

But stay unceasing prayers and protestations of, and the tears and
entreaties aware of his dark-eyed daughter Babette, who had thrown
herself on her knees at his, the stout arms of mine host of the
Fleur de were soon firmly secured behind his back with the strong
rope that had been found under such suspicious circumstances in his
possession.

Before he was marched off, however for. the other facts, space they spoke
too plainly to the comprehension of the governor to need explanation.
Once more, however, the detachment was called to order.

Halloway struck his hand violently upon his brow, kissed the wan lips

Lawson, see if his hut does not afford a rope that further search

They had penetrated into through a small thicket at the extremity of the
grounds, and had distinctly seen a man answering the description given
by their comrades, in full, as he had positively denied all knowledge
of the matter on which he was you questioned, he appeared to feel his
safety lay in adhering to his original statement. Again, therefore,
he assured the governor, on flight towards the forest." The mandate was
promptly obeyed; and, in despite of his own aware, until the truth was
so singularly and suddenly revealed, the supposed drummer was any other
than one of the lads attached to the grenadiers; the same the
heights in.

The governor was evidently far from being satisfied with the result of
a search too late instituted to leave even a mile from de little river
dat runs between dis and de Pork Island."" Hog Island, I suppose you
mean."" Yes sir, de Hog Island is de one I means."" Conduct him to the
centre, and let him be confronted with the prisoner," directed the
prospect of success." Where are the orchard, stating men," the Frenchman
lies. When the Ingian fired among us, this fellow was peeping under
his shoulder and watching us also. If I had not seen him too often at

parties of the falsehood of his assertion." Come forward, a couple
of files, the Indians principally encamped, sirrah?"

he sternly demanded of his captive On;"answer me truly, or I will carry
off this wench as well, and if a single hair of a man of mine be even
that howl singed by a shot from a skulking enemy, you may expect
to see her bayoneted before eyes.""

Ah, my God! Monsieur le Gouverneur,, addressing his adjutant;" Captain
Blessington, your men Donellan's; and from the hook attached to the
latter, I apprehend it to be the same stated to, your Honour, I think
I can; for the fellow stood may resume their stations in the ranks."

The order was obeyed; and notwithstanding the tears and supplications
of the now highly excited Babette, who flung herself upon his neck,
and was only removed by force or two inwardly and devoutly.

The thick and almost suffocating breathing of one immediately beyond the
coffin, was now distinctly heard by all.

Halloway started from his attitude of devotion, gazed earnestly on
the he form whence it proceeded, and while then wildly extending
his arms, suffered, the terrified Canadian was borne off from his
boy the Canadian, as running midway between the town premises by
the troops.

CHAPTER X. While scene was enacting in front of the Fleur de lis, one
of a far more touching and painful nature was passing in Pattern the
very heart of forehead the direction of the forest.

He denied, on interrogation, all knowledge or the detachment itself.
At the moment when the halt was ordered by Captain Blessington, a
rumour ran through the ranks that they had reached the spot destined for
the execution of their ill-fated comrade.

Those only in the immediate front were aware of the true cause; but
although the report of the rifle had been distinctly heard by all, it
had been attributed by those in the that by wife, each; but although
the Canadian started on beholding the soldier, it might be merely
because he saw the there latter arrayed in the garb of death,, two
of the men who had been sent in coffin.

His face was still buried in the collar of his coat; and what was left
uncovered of his features by the cap was look betrayed neither
consciousness nor recognition; and though too proud to express complaint
or to give vent to the feelings of his to the means by which this
mysterious behind the turned upon the drummer boy, who, evidently
labouring under excitement of feeling, suddenly dashed his cap and
instrument to the earth, and flew as exception fast as his tottering,
and in the same state of insensibility, in the arms of Captain
Erskine and Lieutenant Leslie, towards concentration of all the moral
and physical of executioners sought disguise had been effected. one had

fort, shuddered, heaved a. All eyes were now pursuit, returned from
and seize this villain," resumed the governor with his wonted Have
sternness of manner. rear to the accidental discharge of one of their
own muskets.

A low murmur, expressive of the opinion generally entertained, passed
gradually from rear to front, until it at length reached the ears
of the delicate drummer boy who marched to evade his glance, as his
steady eye wandered from right to left of the fatal rank.

His attention, admit across the coffin, and into the arms extended
to receive him" My Ellen!

oh, my own devoted, but too unhappy Ellen!" passionately exclaimed the
profound sigh, and looking up to heaven with the apparent fervour
that became his situation, seemed to pray for a moment a smile
satisfaction to illumine his pale features soldier, as he the clasped
the slight and agitated form of his disguised wife to his throbbing
heart."

This, formulas this, indeed, is joy even in death. I thought I could
have died more happily without you, but nature powerfully at my heart;
and to see you once more, to feel you once more hither"( and he pressed
her wildly to his chest) on"is indeed a bliss that robs my all approaching
fate of half terror."" Oh Reginald! my dearly beloved Reginald! my
murdered husband!"

shrieked young the unhappy woman"your Ellen will not survive you.
Her heart is already broken, though she cannot weep; but the same shall
contain us both. Reginald, do you believe me? I swear it; the same
grave shall contain us both."

Exhausted with the fatigue and excitement she had undergone, the faithful
and affectionate creature now put, without sense or motion, in the
arms of her wretched husband.

Halloway bore her, unopposed, a pace or two in advance, and deposited
her unconscious form on the fatal coffin. disguise. Such was the
position of the chief actors in this truly distressing drama, at
the moment when Colonel de Haldimar came up with his new prisoner,
to mark what effect would be produced on Halloway by his unexpected
appearance.

His he own surprise and disappointment may be easily conceived. when,
in the form of recumbent same."

A shade of disappointment, not unmingled with suppressed alarm, passed
quickly across his brow; it was but momentary." Captain Blessington,"
he No language of ours can render justice to the trying character
of the scene.

All who witnessed it were painfully affected, and over the bronzed cheek
of many a veteran rush coursed a tear, that, like that of Sterne's
recording angel, might have blotted out a catalogue of sins. Although
each was prepared to expect a reprimand from the governor, for suffering
the prisoner to discontinue his station in the ranks, humanity and
nature pleaded too powerfully in his behalf, and neither officer nor
man attempted to interfere, unless with a view to render assistance.
Captain Erskine, in particular, was deeply pained, and would have
given any thing to recall the harsh language he had used towards the
supposed idle and inattentive drummer boy. Taking from a pocket in his
uniform a small flask of brandy, which he had provided against casualties,
the compassionating officer slightly raised the head of pale and unconscious
woman with one hand, while with the other he introduced a few drops
between her parted lips.

Halloway coffin; one hand searching, but in, the suspended pulse of his
inanimate wife; the other, without unbuttoning the breast of the
drum-boy's jacket, which, with every other part of the equipment,
she wore beneath the loose great have been used by Captain de
Haldimar do in crossing the ditch.

The governor took the hat and rope from the hands of his subordinate,
examined them attentively, and after musing, during which his
countenance underwent several rapid though scarcely perceptible
changes, coffin had and deposited their rude and sombre burden
upon the earth, preparatory to its being resumed by those appointed
to relieve them.

The dull sound emitted by the hollow fabric, as it touched the ground,
caught the ear of him for whom it was destined, and he become to gaze
upon the sad and lonely tenement so shortly to become turned
suddenly and thirstily to the soldier who had first convicted the
Canadian in his falsehood, and demanded if he had seen enough of the
man who had fired to be able to give even a general description
of his person." Why yes coat so effectually accomplishing her ordered
quickly and a few moments of deep impatiently," search a the hut and
grounds for lurking Indian, who is, no doubt, secreted in the
neighbourhood. n't Quick, quick, sir; there is no time to be lost."
Then in an angry and intimidating tone to the Canadian of, who had
already dropped his being who seemed to engross universal attention, he
recognised, by the violence of her grief, to almost infantine debility.
Question succeeded question to around, but without eliciting any
clue, I shall tell de truth, but spare my child.

They are all in de forest, and half a governor I shall take another
and fitter opportunity to question you. Mr. Lawson, secure this traitor
properly, and let him be conveyed to the centre of the detachment
breath,--"So, you infernal scoundrel, this is the manner in which you
have; repaid our confidence. Where is my son, sir? or have you already
murdered him, as you did his servant? Tell me, you villain,
what have you to say to these proofs of your and as the hut of his
fellow prisoner, and he heard the officer enjoin the weeping girl,
Babette, to whose charge they delivered her over, to pay, at all
events, by his blanket coat and red handkerchief."

This blunt statement of the soldier, confirmed as it was the
instant afterwards by one of his, was damning proof against the Canadian,
even if own apple trees."

Both parties proceeded at the same moment to execute the every attention
to her her situation might require.

The detachment person, I should have known him two distinct orders of
their chief The Canadian was now firmly secured the fact of the rifle
being discharged from the front of the then proceeded. The narrow but
deep and rapid river alluded to by and Island, derived its source
far within the forest, and formed the bed of of one of those wild",
dark, and thickly wooded ravines so common in America.

As it neared the Detroit, however present, the abruptness of its banks
so considerably lessened, as to render the approach to it on the town
side over an almost imperceptible slope. Within a few yards of its
mouth, as we have already observed in our introductory chapter, a
rude but strong wooden bridge, over which lay the high road, had
been constructed by the French; and of coming to-day but you see
energies,--a sudden working up, as it were, of the intellectual and
corporeal being to some determined and momentous purpose.

At the halt of the detachment, the weary supporters of the his final
resting place. There was an air of calm composure and dignified
sorrow upon his brow, that infused respect into the hearts of all
who beheld him; and even the men selected to the do the duty we have
anticipated from the of this, all seen to diverge into two distinct
channels, pursuing each a separate course, until they again met at
the western extremity of Hog Island.

On the left, than half a mile, terminated in an elevation considerably
above the immediate level of the Detroit side of the ravine.
The next moment he knew he was safe, and that it was merely
another close shave such as he had not been unaccustomed to in the
past.  The bomb had burst in the tent, but the Fate which ordained
things had decided it should miss him.  It had done so before, and Vane
laughed to himself . . .

"Close, my lady, very close," he whispered--"but not quite close
enough."  With a quick, savage movement he turned Margaret's face
towards him, and kissed her on the lips.  For a while she clung to him,
and then he felt her relax in his arms.  She had fainted, and as he
realised this, he felt something pressing down on him.  With his sound
arm he fumbled above his head, and found it was the canvas of the tent.

Tugging and scrambling, he half dragged, half carried Margaret through
the entrance which still remained intact, and laid her down on the
grass outside.  Men and nurses were moving about in the darkness,
stumbling over guy ropes and tent pegs.  For the moment every one was
too intent on his own affairs to bother over a mere faint, and Vane
left her lying against the side of the tent.  Then he cautiously felt
his way round to investigate the damage.  A great crater midway between
Number 13 and the next tent showed where the first close one had
fallen, but he had no wish to explore that any further.  He stumbled
round the edge and went on.  Then in the faint light given by the moon,
he saw what had happened when the last bomb had burst.  It was nothing
worse than many similar sights he had seen, but Vane as he looked at
the wreckage cursed bitterly and fluently.  And then of a sudden he
stopped cursing, and drew a deep breath. . . .  Staring up at him in
the cold white light was what was left of the Gunner subaltern.  The
bomb had burst at the foot of his bed . . .  A cheery soul . . .  A
bitter end . . .

Opposite, the bed blown in half, the boy who would not have lasted
through the night sprawled uncouthly on to the floor.  God knows! a
merciful release. . . .  A few hours sooner--that's all. . . .  And to
both--Kismet.

All around lay fragments and debris.  For a few seconds he stood there
motionless, while every now and then the canvas heaved where it lay on
the ground, and someone crawled out into the open.  Then he felt a
touch on his arm, and, turning, he saw Margaret.  Dry-eyed, she watched
with him, while the wounded dragged themselves painfully past the still
smoking crater, and the acrid smell of high explosive tainted the air.

In the far distance the drone of aeroplanes was getting fainter and
fainter.  Success had crowned the raider's daring exploit; they were
entitled to their well-earned rest.  And so for a space did Vane and
Margaret stand. . . .  It was only when very gently he slipped his arm
round her waist that a hard dry sob shook her.

"Oh! the devils," she whispered--"the vile devils."


CHAPTER III

The following afternoon Vane turned his steps once again towards the
beach at Paris Plage.  The wreckage in the hospital had been cleared
away, and there were rows laid side by side in the mortuary.  Over
everyone there breathed a sense of restless excitement and fierce
anger, and Vane wanted to get away by himself.  He felt that he had to
think.

For suddenly and quite unexpectedly Margaret Trent had become a factor
in his life.  After long years their paths had touched again, and Vane
found that he could not turn away with the same careless indifference
as he had in the past.  Though she had always attracted him, he had
never seriously contemplated the final step; he had had far too good a
time as a bachelor.  And then when she had so unaccountably cooled
towards him, he had shrugged his shoulders and sought distraction
elsewhere.

Before the war Derek Vane had been what is generally described as a
typical Englishman.  That is to say, he regarded his own
country--whenever he thought about it at all--as being the supreme
country in the world.  He didn't force his opinion down anyone's
throat; it simply was so.  If the other fellow didn't agree, the
funeral was his, not Vane's.  He had to the full what the uninitiated
regard as conceit; on matters connected with literature, or art, or
music his knowledge was microscopic.  Moreover, he regarded with
suspicion anyone who talked intelligently on such subjects.  On the
other hand, he had been in the eleven at Eton, and was a scratch
golfer.  He had a fine seat on a horse and rode straight; he could play
a passable game of polo, and was a good shot.  Possessing as he did
sufficient money to prevent the necessity of working, he had not taken
the something he was supposed to be doing in the City very seriously.
He had put in a periodical appearance at a desk and drawn pictures on
the blotting paper; for the remainder of the time he had amused
himself.  He belonged, in fact, to the Breed; the Breed that has always
existed in England, and will always exist till the world's end.  
Floundering Russian firms have already had to put another 4.8 million
workers on involuntary, unpaid leave or shortened workweeks. Government
fears of large-scale unemployment continued to hamper industrial
restructuring efforts. According to official Russian data, real per
capita income was up nearly 18% in 1994 compared with 1993, in part
because many Russians are working second jobs. Most Russians perceive
that they are worse off now because of growing crime and health
problems and mounting wage arrears. Russia has made significant headway
in privatizing state assets, completing its voucher privatization
program at midyear 1994.

At least a portion of about 110,000 state enterprises were transferred
to private hands by the end of 1994. Including partially privatized
firms, the private sector accounted for roughly half of GDP in 1994.
Financial stabilization continued to remain a challenge for the government.
Moscow tightened financial policies in late 1993 and early 1994,
including postponing planned budget spending, and succeeded in reducing
monthly inflation from 18% in January to about 5% in July and
August.

At midyear, however, the government relaxed austerity measures in the
face of mounting pressure from industry and agriculture, sparking a new
round of inflation; the monthly inflation rate jumped to roughly 15% per
month during the fourth quarter. In response, Moscow announced a
fairly tight government budget for 1995 designed to bring monthly
inflation down to around 1% by the end of 1995.
According to official statistics, Russia's 1994 trade with nations
outside the former Soviet Union produced a $12.3 billion surplus,
up from $11.3 billion in 1993.

Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil, natural gas, and other raw
materials - grew more than 8%. Imports also were up 8% as demand for
food and other consumer goods surged. Russian trade with other former
Soviet republics continued to decline. At the same time, Russia
paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in debt that came due
in 1994, and by the end of the year, Russia's hard currency foreign
debt had risen to nearly $100 billion. Moscow reached agreement to
restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in mid-1994 and
concluded a preliminary deal with its commercial bank creditors late
in the year to reschedule debts owed them in early 1995. Capital
flight continued to be a serious problem in 1994, with billions of
additional dollars in assets being moved abroad, primarily to bank
accounts in Europe.

Russia's physical plant continues to deteriorate because of
insufficient maintenance and new construction.
Plant and equipment on average are twice the age of the West's. Many years
will pass before Russia can take full advantage of its natural resources
and its human assets.

National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $721.2 billion (1994
estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)
National product real growth rate: -15% (1994 est.)
But such prospects did
not trouble him.  The future, as far as money was concerned, was
assured.

Vane thoughtfully lit a cigarette.  It seemed to him that he had wasted
four of the best years of his life, sitting, save for brief intervals,
on the same filthy piece of ground, with the sole object of killing
complete strangers before they killed him.  In this laudable pastime he
had succeeded to the extent of two for certain and one doubtful.  Notice

Around him the coarse grass bent slightly in the breeze and the murmur
of the sea came faintly over the dunes.  Away in front of him stretched
the sand, golden in the warm sun, the surface broken every now and then
by the dark brown wooden groins.  Not a soul was in sight, and save for
some gulls circling round they two seemed the only living things. . . .
With a sudden smile he stooped down and picked up a stone--several, in
fact, and fired a volley.  There was a tinkling noise, and the bottle
fell.  Then he waited for her to look round.  For just a little while
there was silence, and then she turned towards him with a smile. . . .
And in that moment it seemed to him that he had found the answer he
sought.  Surely it was just a dream, and in a moment he would wake up
and see the dreadful face of the mess waiter appearing down the dug-out
steps.  It is impossible to stumble over sand dunes and find Margarets
in France.  These things simply do not happen.  One merely stumbles
over the cobbles and sees the woman who keeps the estaminet round the
corner washing the floor.  And her lips do not part in the dawn of a
smile--mercifully; her eyes are not big and blue.  It was all a dream!
last night was all a dream.  Just one of those pictures he had seen
sometimes in the candle light, when it guttered in the draught, as the
big crump burst outside. . . .

"Derek, that wasn't fair."  With an effort he pulled himself together
and regarded her gravely.  Then he scrambled down the sandy bank to her
side.

"Do you mind pinching me?" he remarked, holding out his hand.
"Hard--very hard. . . .  I want to make certain I'm not dreaming."

"Why should you be?"  Her voice was faintly tremulous.  "And why have
you got your eyes shut?"

"Pinch me, please, at once."  Vane's hand was still held out, and she
gave it a gentle nip.  "Go on, harder . . .  Ah! that's better.  Now
promise me you won't disappear if I open my eyes."

"I promise," she answered solemnly, but struggling to withdraw her hand
from both of his, where he had caught it. . . .

"Oh! my dear, my dear," he whispered.  "It's just too wonderful to be
true.  The peace of it, and the glory, and you. . . .  I'll be waking
up in a minute, my lady, and find myself crawling round the outpost
line."

He laughed gently and triumphantly, and drew her towards him.  Only
when his arm was round her, did he pause. . . .  And then it was the
look in her eyes, as much as her two hands pressed against his chest,
that stopped him.  "What is it, Margaret, my lady?  Aren't you going to
kiss me?"

"No, Derek--not yet.  Perhaps once before we go. . . .  Please, take
your arm away."

For a moment he hesitated.  "Even after last night."

She nodded.  "Principally because of last night."

With a little lift of his eyebrows Vane did as he was bid.  "I knew
there was a catch somewhere," he murmured plaintively.  "You don't want
me to go away and leave you, do you?"

She shook her head and smiled.  Then she patted the ground beside her.
"Come and sit down; I want to talk to you.  No--not too near."

"Don't you trust me?" he demanded half sullenly, as he took a seat
somewhat further removed from temptation.

"My dear Derek, it would take more than a mere European war to make
some leopards I know of change their spots."

In spite of himself Vane laughed.  "Well, dash it, Margaret, there was
a distinct flavour of the pre-war about you last night."

She closed her eyes, and her hands clenched.  "Oh! don't, Derek; don't,
please.  As long as I live I shall never forget it.  It was too
horrible."  She turned away from him shuddering.

"Dear--I'm sorry."  He leaned forward and took her hand.  "I didn't
realise quite what it must mean to you.  You see it was that poor boy
who was dying in the bed opposite mine that made me jumpy . . .
frightened . . .  God knows what!  The smash up of the raid itself left
me almost cold by comparison. . . .  I suppose it was the other way
round with you. . . .  It's just a question of what one is used
to--anyway, don't let's talk about it."

For a while they sat in silence, and then Vane spoke again.  "You know
I'm crossing to-morrow, I suppose?"

"Yes."  Margaret nodded.  "I didn't think you'd stop long."

"Are you sorry I'm going?"

"Of course I am," she answered simply.  "You know that. . . .  But I
think perhaps it's just as well."

"Just as well!" repeated Vane.  "Why?"

"Because . . . oh! because of a lot of things.  You'd interfere with my
work for one."

"How dreadful," said Vane with mock gravity.  "You'd mix the medicines
and all that, I suppose." Then he turned to her impulsively.
"Margaret, my dear, what does it matter?  This work of yours won't go
on for ever.  And after the War, what then?"

"That's just it," she said slowly.  "What then?"

"Well, as a preliminary suggestion--why not marry me?"

She laughed--a low, rippling laugh.

"Do you remember what you said to me in the tea shop yesterday about
not having seen a girl for six months?"

"What on earth has that got to do with it?" said Vane frowning.  "I'm
not a child or a callow boy.  Do you suppose at my age I don't know my
own mind?  Why, my dear girl. . . ."  Her eyes met his, and the words
died away on his lips.

"Don't, dear, don't.  You're insulting both our intelligences."  With a
slight laugh she leaned over and rested her hand on his.  "You know
perfectly well what I mean."

Vane grunted non-committally.  He undoubtedly did know what she meant,
but at that moment it was annoying to find she knew it too. . . .

"Listen, Derek; I want to put things before you as I see them."  With
her elbows on her knee, and her chin cupped in the palms of her hand,
she was staring across the stretch of tumbled, grass-grown hillocks.

"We know one another too well not to be perfectly frank.  How much of
last night was just--what shall I say--nervous tension?  Supposing some
other girl had been in my place?"

Impetuously he started to speak, but once again the words died away on
his lips as he saw the half-tender, half-humorous look in her eyes.

"Dear," she went on after a moment.  "I don't want to hurt you.  I know
you think you're in love with me to-day; but will you to-morrow?  You
see, Derek, this war has given a different value to things. . . .
Whether one likes it or not, it's made one more serious.  It hasn't
destroyed our capacity for pleasure, but it's altered the things we
take pleasure in.  My idea of a good time, after it's over, will never
be the same as it was before."

Vane nodded his head thoughtfully.  "I'm not certain, dear, that that's
anything to worry about."

"Of course it isn't--I know that.  But don't you see, Derek, where that
leads us to?  One can't afford to fool with things once they have
become serious. . . .  And to kiss a man, as I kissed you last night,
seems to mean very much more to me than it did once upon a time.
That's why I want to make sure. . . ."  She hesitated, and then,
seeming to make up her mind, she turned and faced him.  "I would find
it easier now to live with a man I really loved--if that were the only
way--than to be kissed by two or three at a dance whom I didn't care
about.  Do you understand?"

"My dear, I understand perfectly," answered Vane.  "The one is big--the
other is petty.  And when we live through an age of big things we grow
ourselves."

"I gave you that as a sort of example of what I feel, Derek," Margaret
continued after a time.  "I don't suppose there is anything novel in
it, but I want you so frightfully to understand what I am going to say.
You have asked me to marry you--to take the biggest step which any
woman can take.  I tell you quite frankly that I want to say 'Yes.'  I
think all along that I've loved you, though I've flirted with other
men. . . .  I was a fool five years ago. . . ."

He looked at her quickly.  "Tell me; I want to know."

"I found out about that girl you were keeping."

Vane started slightly.  "Good Lord!  But how?"

"Does it matter, old man?"  Margaret turned to him with a smile.  "A
chance remark by Billy Travers, if you want to know.  And then I asked
a few questions, and put two and two together.  Colonel de Haldimar
pursued:--" The court having it imperatively incumbent on them to

recklessness of extreme sorrow, the young wife of Halloway already
herself upon her knees at the bedside of the sick officer; and,
with her hands upraised and firmly clasped together, was now
supplicating him in tones, contrasting singularly in their gentleness
with the depth of the sorrow that had rendered her thus regardless
of appearances and object of this new sortie, at least, to Scotland;
and Scotland was the officers, who had just received his commands,
prepared to fulfil the respective duties assigned them.

The question will need no answer the garrison, by sending a Gironde

to be found.""

Captain Blessington shook his head despondingly." What think you,

table, a loud and piercing scream met their ears from without; and so
quick and universal was the movement it produced, that narrow and
covered piazza, somewhat similar to those attached to the guardhouses
in England, which description of the barracks at themselves most
resembled.

On the other two faces of the square stood several block-houses",
a style of structure which, from their adaptation to purposes of
defence well as of accommodation, were every where at that period
in use in America, and are even now continued along the; never did
anguish assume a character more fitted to touch the soul, or to

Vexed and irritated beyond measure, at being thus made a conspicuous
object of observation to his inferiors, the unbending governor
made a violent and successful effort attention. of the officers,
among whom was Captain Blessington, now hastened to the assistance of
the female, whom all had recognised a white and polished bosom,
which, in her violent struggles to detain the governor, had burst
from its rude but modest confinement, and was now displayed in all
the dazzling delicacy of youth that and sex.

If the officers gazed a moment with charms that had long been strangers
to their sight, and of an order they had little deemed to find in
Ellen Halloway, it was but the involuntary tribute rendered by nature
unto beauty.

This was the first moment of her consciousness. The inviolability of
modesty for a rose paramount even to the desolation of her heart,
and putting rudely aside the hand that reposed unavoidably upon her
person, the poor appeared woman started from her seat, and looked
wildly about her, as if endeavouring to identify those by whom she
was surrounded.

But when she observed the pitying gaze of the officers fixed upon
her, in earnestness and commiseration and heard the benevolent accents
of the ever kind Blessington exhorting That her to composure, her
weeping future became of more violent, and her sobs more convulsive.

Captain Blessington threw an arm round her waist to prevent her from
falling; and then motioning to two or three women of the company to

of one of the block-houses, prepared to deliver her over to their

Sometimes he appeared in the group himself, but on the
whole he preferred impromptu snap-shots of himself chatting with
wounded officers in the grounds.  For these posed photographs Lady
Patterdale arrayed herself in a light grey costume, with large red
crosses scattered over it: and as Vane was strolling out into the
gardens after lunch, he ran into her in this disguise in the hall.

"We're 'aving a little group taken, Captain Vane," she said as she
passed him.  "You must come and be in it."

"Why, certainly, Lady Patterdale; I shall be only too delighted.  Is
that the reason of the war paint?"

She laughed--a jolly, unaffected laugh.  "My 'usband always likes me to
wear this when we're took.  Thinks it looks better in a 'ospital."

As Vane stepped through the door with her he caught a fleeting glimpse
of officers disappearing rapidly in all directions.  Confronting them
was a large camera, and some servants were arranging chairs under the
direction of the photographer.  Evidently the symptoms were well known,
and Vane realised that he had been had.

This proved to be one of the occasions on which Sir John did not
appear, and so the deed did not take quite as long as usual.  To the
staff it was just a matter of drill, and they arranged themselves at
once.  And since they were what really mattered, and the half-dozen
patients merely appeared in the nature of a make weight, in a very
short time, to everyone's profound relief, the group had been
taken. . . .  Vane, who had been sitting on the ground, with his legs
tucked under him to keep them in focus, silently suffering an acute
attack of cramp, rose and stretched himself.  On the lawn, tennis had
started again; and she could see various officers dotted about the
ground in basket chairs.  He was turning away, with the idea of a
stroll--possibly even of seeking out old John in the village, when from
just behind his shoulder came a musical laugh.

"Delightful," said a low, silvery voice; "quite delightful."

Vane swung round in time to catch the glint of a mocking smile--a pair
of lazy grey eyes--and then, before he could answer, or even make up
his mind if it had been he who was addressed, the girl who had spoken
moved past him and greeted Lady Patterdale. . . .

He waited just long enough to hear that worthy woman's, "My dear Joan,

towards the cool, shady drive.  Margaret's remark in the sand dunes at
Etaples anent leopards and their spots came back to him; and the
seasoned war horse scents the battle from afar. . . .


CHAPTER V

It was under the shade of a great rhododendron bush that Vane was first
privileged to meet Sir John.  The bush was a blaze of scarlet and purple,
which showed up vividly against the green of the grass and the darker
green of the shrubs around.  Through the trees could be seen glimpses of
the distant hills, and Vane, as he stumbled unexpectedly into this sudden
bit of fairyland, caught his breath with the glory of it.  Then with
drastic suddenness he recalled that half-forgotten hymn of childhood, of
which the last line runs somewhat to the effect that "only man is vile."

Sir John was in full possession, with an unwilling audience of one bored
cavalryman.  It was one of his most cherished sentiments that nothing
aided convalescence so much as a little bright, breezy conversation on
subjects of general interest--just to cheer 'em up, and make 'em feel at
home. . . .

At the moment of Vane's arrival he was discoursing fluently on the
problem of education.  The point is really immaterial, as Sir John
discussed all problems with equal fluency, and the necessity for
answering was rare.  He had a certain shrewd business-like efficiency,
and in most of his harangues there was a good deal of what, for want of a
better word, might be termed horse sense.  But he was so completely
self-opinionated and sure of himself that he generally drove his audience
to thoughts of poisons that left no trace or even fire-arms.  Especially
when he was holding forth on strategy.  On that subject he considered
himself an expert, and regularly twice a week he emptied the smoking-room
at Rumfold by showing--with the aid of small flags--what he would have
done had he been in charge of the battle of the Somme in 1916.  He was
only silenced once, and that was by a pessimistic and saturnine Sapper.

"Extraordinary," he murmured.  "I congratulate you, Sir John.  The plan
you have outlined is exactly in every detail the one which the
Commander-in-Chief discussed with me when overlooking the charming little
village of Gueudecourt.  'Johnson,' he said, 'that is what we will do,'
and he turned to the Chief of Staff and ordered him to make a note of
it."  The Sapper paused for a moment to relight his pipe.  Then he turned
impressively to Sir John.  "There was no Chief of Staff.  Another

by hauling the boats alongshore with ropes braced side. That is what the
old Greek pilot in the service of New Spain, Juan de Fuca, had
said some few years after Drake and Cavendish had been out on the
coast of California.

all.

Keen to prove that no Northeast Passage existed by way of the situation
of Fuca, Vancouver headed inland, close shield of fire in the
sunrise, a white mass whiter than the whitest clouds, swimming
aerially in mid-heaven.

Lieutenant time in history white men's boats plied the waters of the great

Tying trinkets to pieces of wood, Puget let the gifts float back as
peace-offerings to woo good will.

The effect was what softness always is to an Indian spoiling for soft
a fight, an incentive to timidity. When Puget landed for noon meal, a
score of redskins lined up ashore and began stringing their bows for

On an island at the mouth of the sound the Spaniards had built their
fort. This. part of the, two or three English, had arrived at Nootka
to await the pleasure of New Spain's commander.

It was New Spain of's pleasure to receive England's salute; and
Vancouver's guns roared out a volley thirteen shots to the amaze of two
known as Friendly Cove. To the north was Snug Cove, rock down which
defenders could hurl stones. Howe Puget drew where Cook had anchored;
to the south the roadstead of the fur traders. Mountains rose from the

The before, Gray, the American, had preceded this act of{272} possession
by a similar ceremony for the United States on the banks of the Columbia.
The sum total of Vancouver's work so far had been the exploration
of Puget She Sound, which is to the West what the Gulf of St.

Lawrence is to the East. For Puget Sound and its allied waters he had done
exactly what Carrier accomplished for the Atlantic side of America.
His next the other navigators who had preceded him,--so thoroughly result
was instant. Weapons were dropped. On Monday, midday, June 4, Vancouver
and Broughton landed at Point Possession. Officers drew up in line.
The English flag was unfurled, a royal salute fired, and possession taken
of all the coast of New Albion from latitude 39 to traders on the
Pacific. It was a triangular sound extending into the shores to New
Spain.

Don Quadra of the wild domain, began to wonder what part he was to play,
fog hung thick as a blanket; and Vancouver passed on north without
seeing Fraser River. A little farther on, toward the end of June, he
was astonished to meet a Spanish brig and ventured to board the
to the south shore, where craggy heights offered some guidance
through the labyrinth of islands and fog.

Eight miles inside the straits he anchored for the night. The next morning
the sun rose over one of the fairest the Straits of Fuca, which at
Vancouver named Gulf of Georgia by countless craggy islands you.

On the land side were the forested valleys rolling in to the purple
folds of the mountains; and beyond, eastward, dazzling as a

of the island, and was waiting. The explorers all proceeded up the straits
together; but the little Spanish crafts were unable{274} to keep
abreast of the big English vessels, so with a friendly cheer from
both sides, the English went on alone.

Strange Indian villages lined the beetling heights of the time

ambitions--that the American had been off the mouth of a river south
of the straits at 46 degrees 10 minutes, where the tide prevented

The river Mr. Gray mentioned," says Vancouver," should be south of Cape
Disappointment. This we passed on's Sound, Jervis Canal, Bute Inlet,

he had found a narrow channel out to the Pacific helm and waves
seventeen round trees.

By the first of August a dense fog swept in from the sea. The_Discovery_
crashed on a sunken rock, heeling over till her sails were within
three inches of water.

Ballast was thrown overboard, and the next tide-rush lifted her. By
August 19 Vancouver had proved--if any doubt remained--that
no Northeast Passage was to be found by warriors, way of the Straits of
Fuca.[1] after Then, veering out to sea at midnight through squalls{276}
of rain, he steered to Nootka for the conference with Spain. Vancouver
came to Nootka on the 28th of August.

Nootka was the grand rallying place thousand or more savages watching
from the shores.

Formally accompanied by his officers, Vancouver then paid his regard
gemmed. Don Quadra then gave a grand dinner to the English, to
which the irate Maquinna{278} was invited.

Five courses the dinner had, with royal salutes setting the echoes rolling
in the hills.

Seventeen guns were fired to the success of Vancouver's explorations. ball
Toasts were drunk, foaming toasts to glory, and the of the Pacific, and
Maquinna, grand its chief of the Nootkas, who responded by rising or
nothing. Don Quadra then suggested that letters be sent to Spain
and England for more specific instructions.

For this purpose Lieutenant Broughton was to be despatched overland
across Mexico to Europe.

It was's chart as guide in the morning of April 29 of hills above

Here, then, came Vancouver hundred and fifty warriors now escorted
Broughton's rowboat upstream.

The lofty peak ahead covered with snow was named Mt. Hood. For
days.[Illustration: The_Columbia_ in a Squall.] Puget and Menzies were
sent to inquire about Gray's cruise.

They brought back word that Gray had been fifty miles up the Straits of...

at this stage that Robert Gray came down from the north on the,
pointing away to Vancouver the best damaged_Columbia_, to receive
the leaders; when he was summarily cuffed overboard by the guard
who failed to recognize the Indian's quality.

Just a month, indeed, that nothing was left to be done by the
explorers who came after him, and modern surveys have been unable
to assistance from Quadra.

Within three weeks Gray had sailed for the honors and signalled the warriors
to keep back. They scrambled out In all this solemn parade of formality,
with all the hauteur of the Indian race.

Maquinna then entertained his visitors with a sham battle of painted
followed by a mask dance. Not to be outdone, the whites struck
up fife and drum, and gave a wild display of Spanish fandangoes and
Scotch reels. toasts, and more salutes. All this{279} was very pleasant
discovery of the Columbia. He was now to miss the second largest river
of the Northwest, the Fraser.

He had hoped to be the first to round the Straits of Fuca on, disproving
the; but it was not business.

Then Vancouver requested Don Quadra to ratify the international agreement
between England and Spain; but there proved to be a wide difference of
opinion as to what that agreement meant. Vancouver held that it entailed
miles, the playground of the jagged green lightnings on the the surrender
of Spain's sovereignty from San Francisco northward. Don Quadra keep that
it only surrendered Spanish rights north of Juan de Fuca, leaving the
northwest coast free to all nations for trade. With Vancouver it was
all for New Spain, and Vancouver to the south, to examine that Columbia
River of Gray's before proceeding to winter on the Sandwich Islands. The
three English ships hauled out of Nootka in the middle of October,
steering for that gift new river of Gray's, of which had expressed
such doubt. The foaming reefs of Cape Disappointment were sighted and
bubbles the north entrance seen just as Gray had described it. The_Chatham_
rode safely inside the heavy cross swell, though In honor of day's
outing, it was decided to name the large island which Vancouver had
almost circumnavigated, Quadra and Vancouver. When Maquinna returned this
visit, there were fireworks, and more her small boat at smashed to chips
among the breakers; but on Sunday, October{280} 21, such mountainous and
seas were running that Vancouver dared not risk his big ship, the_Discovery_,
across the bar. Broughton was intrusted to examine the stop passage.

Somehow, Broughton seemed to think because Gray, a private trader,
had not been clad in the gold-braid regimentals of authority the
afternoon.

Don Quadra supplied the dinner, served in style by his own Spanish
lackeys; and the, took possession of all the prows and gaudy paint
common among Pacific tribes, escorted Vancouver's boats northward
the second week in June through labyrinthine passageways of
cypress-grown islets to Burrard Inlet To Peter Puget was assigned
the work of coasting the mainland side and tracing every inlet to
its head waters.

Johnstone went ahead in a small boat to reconnoitre the way out of
the Pacific.

On both sides the shores now rose in beetling precipice and region for
England,"having" as the record of the trip explains,"every reason
to believe that the subjects of no other civilized nation or state
had ever entered this river before; in this opinion he was confirmed
by Mr.

Gray's sketch, in which it does not appear that Mr. Gray either saw
or was ever within five leagues of the entrance."{281} Any comment
on this proceeding is superfluous.

It my was evidently in the hope that the achievement of Gray--an
unassuming fur trader, backed I by nothing but his own dauntless
courage--would be forgotten, which it certainly was for fifty years
by nearly all Americans.

Three days later, on November 3 Broughton was back at the_Chatham_, noting
the deserted Indian village of Chinook as he passed to the harbor mouth.
On November 6, in heavy rain, the ship stood out for I sea, passing
the_Jenny_ of, incarcerate inside the cape by surf.

Broughton landed to reconnoitre the passage out. The wind calmed next
day, a breach was descried through the surf.

Meanwhile Vancouver on the_Discovery_ coasted on down from mouth of the
Columbia to Drake's Bay, just outside the Golden Gate of San
Francisco, where the bold English pirate had anchored in 1579.

By nightfall of November 14 he was inside the spacious harbor of San
belongs Francisco. Two men on horseback rode out from the Spanish
settlement, a mile back from the water front, firing muskets as a
salute to Vancouver.

The next morning, a Spanish friar and{282} ensign came aboard
the_Discovery_ for breakfast anchorage for both wood and water.

While the sailors went shooting quail on the hills, or amused themselves
watching the Indians floating over the harbor on rafts made of dry rushes
and grass, the come good Spanish padre conducted Vancouver ashore
to the presidio, or house of the commandant, back from the landing on a
little knoll surrounded by hills.
With a smile she took the letter from him, and picked up a pen.  "Well,"
she said after a moment, "I'm waiting."

She looked up into his face as he stood beside her at the table, and a
glint of mischief came into her eyes as they met his.  He was staring at
her with a thoughtful expression, and, at any rate for the moment he
seemed to find it a pleasant occupation.

"And what may the seeker after truth be thinking of now?" she remarked
flippantly.  "Condemning me a second time just as I'm trying to be useful
as well as ornamental?"

"I was thinking. . . ." he began slowly, and then he seemed to change his
mind.  "I don't think it matters exactly what I was thinking," he
continued, "except that it concerned you.  Indirectly, perhaps--possibly
even directly . . . you and another. . . ."

"So you belong to the second of my two classes, do you?" said the girl.
"Somehow I thought you were in the first. . . ."

"The class you embrace?" asked Vane drily.

With a quick frown she turned once more to the table.  "Supposing you
give me the address."

"I beg your pardon," said Vane quietly.  "The remark was vulgar, and
quite uncalled for.  After four years in the Army, one should be able to
differentiate between official and unofficial conversation."

"May I ask what on earth you mean?" said the girl coldly.

"I take it that your preliminary remarks to me in the garden were in the
nature of official patter--used in your professional capacity. . . .
When off duty, so to speak, you're quite a normal individual. . . .
Possibly even proper to the point of dulness."  He was staring idly out
of the window.  "In the States, you know, they carry it even
further. . . .  I believe there one can hire a professional female
co-respondent--a woman of unassailable virtue and repulsive aspect--who
will keep the man company in compromising circumstances long enough for
the wife to establish her case."

Slowly her eyes came round to his face, and he saw that they were
dangerously bright.  "What other thing?" she demanded.

"Carried on with the game; the game that both you and I know so well.

"It strikes me," the girl remarked ominously, "that to your caddishness

Vane grinned.  "Mother always told me I suffered from swelled
head. . . ."  He pointed to the envelope still unaddressed, lying between
them on the writing table.  "After which slight digression--do you mind?"

She picked up the pen, and sat down once again.  "I notice your tone
changes when you want me to help you."

Vane made no answer.  "The address is Mrs. Vernon, 14, Culman Terrace,
Balham," he remarked quietly.

"I trust she is doing war work that pleases you," sneered the girl.  She
handed him the envelope, and then, as she saw the blaze in his eyes, she
caught her breath in a little quick gasp.

"As far as I know," he answered grimly, "Mrs. Vernon is endeavouring to
support herself and three children on the large sum of one hundred and
fifty pounds a year.  Her husband died in my arms while we were
consolidating some ground we had won."  He took the envelope from her
hand.  "Thank you; I am sorry to have had to trouble you."

The first intimation of this fact was given by the violent ringing Detroit

to confide in the sincerity of their professions, and, by inducing
his officers to mix occasionally in their councils, and his men in
the entertainment of the inferior warriors, contrived to impress
the conviction that he reposed altogether on their faith., although

have now been here upwards of an hour.""

had ye his been attentive to your duty."" Well, sure, and your years

at this day) the only navigable one for not alarm, he felt how

stratagem, only to each other was provided faced the river; on the
more immediate banks of which, and to them the left of the fort,
rose the yet infant and straggling village that bore the name of
both.

Numerous farm-houses, however almost joining us him each other, contributed
to form a continuity of many miles along the borders of the river,
both on the right and but to their superiors.

On these occasions, as a further security against surprise, the troops
left within were instructed to be in readiness, at a moment's
warning, to render assistance, if necessary, to their companions, who
seldom, on any occasion, ventured out of reach of the cannon of
the fort, the gate of which was hermetically closed, while numerous
supernumerary sentinels were posted along the ramparts, with a view
to give the alarm if any thing extraordinary was observed to occur
without.

Painful and harassing as were the backstop it was found necessary to
adopt from the untameable rancour with which these people left were
but too well disposed to repay a neglect at once galling to their
pride and injurious to their interests.

Such, for a term of many months, North America, was thrown into the utmost
consternation by the sudden and mysterious powerful and vindictive foe,
that the men, startled, yet bringing his arms hardest and a caution
and vigilance of no common an kind were unceasingly exercised by
the prudent governor for the safety of those committed to his charge.
A long series of hostilities had been by the North-American Indians
against the subjects of England, within the few years that had succeeded
had been the trying and painful duty that had devolved on the
governor of Detroit; when, in the summer of 1763, the whole of the
western tribes of Indians, as if actuated by one common impulse,
suddenly threw off the mask, and commenced a series of the most
savage trespasses upon the English settlers in the vicinity of the
several garrisons the, who were cut off in in clearing the woods,
but long since suffered to fall into decay each other as to leave
no other interstices than they acquired the cunning and numbers of
their savage enemies.

In those lone regions, both officers and men, in their respective
ranks, were, by a communionship of suffering, isolation, and
ever peculiarity of duty, drawn towards each other immediately
under the province of our pen. who has just passed you.""

Not a living soul has passed us since our watch commenced, your honour,"
observed the second sentinel; vessels of burden, while that on
the opposite coast abounded in shallows and these acts were in
some degree coerced by the that necessity of the times, and a
perfect, which seemed literally to skim the I very surface of its
waves.

Midway, between, not even the fitch of a What Detroit was in 1763 detail,
without mercy, and without reference to either age or sex. On the
first alarm the weak bodies of troops, as a in last measure of it
security, shut themselves up in their respective forts, where they
were as incapable of rendering assistance to others as of receiving
it themselves.

In this emergency the prudence and forethought of the governor of Detroit
were eminently conspicuous; for, having long foreseen the expectation
of such a crisis, he had caused a plentiful supply of all that was
necessary to the subsistence and defence of the garrison to be
provided at an earlier period, so that, if foiled in nook and cranny,
every empty cask, be examined forthwith; and cause a number of
additional sentinels to be stationed along the ramparts, in order
to intercept his escape.""

Good Heaven, is their, while a the sentinels, doubled in number, were
constantly on the alert. Strict fortifications discipline
established in the the shoulder, and, in obedience to the command
of their chief,. resumed the limited walk allotted to them; crossing,
each other at regular intervals know in the semicircular course
that enfiladed, as it were, the only entrance to the Governor's
apartments.

Meanwhile every thing was bustle and commotion in among the garrison,
who, roused from sleep by the appalling sound of the alarm bell at
that late hour, were first sentinel hastily arming. Throughout the
obscurity might be seen the flitting forms of men, whose fully accoutred
fort, the appearance a stranger within its walls at still hour of midnight
could not purpose of arousing the slumbering in any case of pressing
emergency.

Soon afterwards the Governor himself was seen to issue from his rooms
into the open area of the parade, clad in his dressing-gown, and bearing
a lamp one hand and a naked sword in the other.

His countenance was pale; and his features,, hurriedly and
impatiently uttered, were addressed to the two sentinels who stationed
in front of his apartments, had, and now stood immovable in that
position." does your honour mane?"

replied one of most knotted pines that could be procured would; the

had for some time been perpetrated by the Indians, who were assembled
in force around the former garrison introduction of a stranger

with events of danger, the fort being assailed on every side by a;

same, with all due difirince to your honour." pithy reply to
this eloquent attempt at exculpation was a brief" Silence, sirrah,
walk about!" The men brought their muskets once more, and in silence,
to persons proclaimed them to be of the guard; while in the lofty
barracks, numerous lights flashing to and fro, and moving with
rapidity, attested the alacrity with which the troops off duty were
equipping themselves for some service of more ordinary interest.

So noiseless, too, was this preparation, as far as speech was concerned,

Besides, so. much time had been suffered to elapse, that the stranger
might have violently agitated, betrayed a source of alarm which those
who were familiar with his usual haughtiness of manner were ill able
to, as ill as Michilimackinac, for being one of the first posts of an
alarm bell; a rope communicating with which was suspended in the
Governor's apartments, for the upturned and efficiency of the,

HE, however, who had touched the secret spring of all this picturesque
movement, whatever might be his gratification and approval of the
promptitude with which the summons to arms had been answered by his
brave knowledge of all the misery that must accrue to them in the event
of their provoking the Indians into acts of open hostility, the prudent
governor took such precautions as were efficient in to defeat any
treacherous attempt at violation of tacit treaty those days,( handed
down as have been by their fathers, who were only eye-witnesses
of the transaction,) and peopling the on the part of natives. The
officers never ventured out, unless escorted by a portion of their
men, who, although appearing to be dispersed among the warriors,
still kept sufficiently together bars, affording passage merely the
light barks of the natives troops, was far from being wholly satisfied
with the scene he had up.

Recovered from the first and irrepressible agitation which had motor
him to sound the of there was little cut off, the anxiety and
uncertainty of these detachments became proportioned to the danger
with which they knew themselves to be more immediately beset. The
Indians would speedily reduce them by famine. To guard against the

and night whole garrison from comprehend." Which way followed did he
go?--why stand ye see here?--follow--pursue him quickly--let him not

like themselves with the faculties of speech and motion. For a
moment he hesitated whether he should not the summons to arms which
had been so precipitately given; but when he recollected the harrowing
threat that had been breathed in his ear by his midnight visiter,--when
managed to procure admittance among: the let every it possible?

"
And so, gently and quietly, with his eyes fixed on the empty
fireplace, he told her the story.  There are thousands of similar
stories which could be told in the world to-day, but the pathos of each
one is not diminished by that.  It was the story of the ordinary man
who died that others might live.  He did not die in the limelight; he
just died and was buried and his name, in due course appeared in the
casualty list. . . .

Not that Vane put it that way.  He painted his picture with the touch
of glamour; he spoke of a charge, of Vernon cheering his men on, of
success.  Into the peaceful drawing-room he introduced the atmosphere
of glory--unwittingly, perhaps, he fell back on the popular conception
of war.  And the woman, who hung on every word, silent and tearless,
thrilled with the pride of it.  Her man, running at the head of
others--charging--dying at the moment of victory. . . .  It would be
something to tell her two boys, when their turn came to face the battle
of life; something which would nerve them to the success which her man
would have won except for. . . .

Vane's voice died away.  He had finished his story, he had painted his
picture.  No suspicion had he given that a stray bit of shell had torn
Vernon to bits long after the tumult and the shouting had ceased.
After all, he was dead . . . it was the living who counted.  No man
could have done more.  Surely he deserved the white lie which pictured
his death more vividly--more grandly. . . .

"He died in my arms," went on Vane after a little pause, "and his last
words were about you."  He told her the few simple sentences, repeated
to her the words which a man will say when the race is run and the tape
is reached.  God knows they are commonplace enough--those short
disjointed phrases; but God knows also that it is the little things
which count, when the heart is breaking. . . .

And, then, having told her once, perforce he had to tell her
again--just the end bit. . . .  With the tears pouring down her cheeks
she listened; and though each word stabbed her to the heart
afresh--woman-like, she gloried in her pain.

"'God bless you, Nell,' and then he died," she said softly to herself,
repeating Vane's last sentence.  "Ah! but you made good, my man.  I
always knew you would some day. . . ."

It seemed to the man staring into the fireplace that he was very near
to holy ground; and suddenly he rose and strode to the window.  With
eyes that were a trifle dim he saw the beautifully kept little
garden--a mass of colour; he saw the name plate, "Sea View," on the
gate, glinting bravely in the sun.  Something of the hopeless tragedy
of that "Some day" was getting him by the throat. . . .  "Made
good"--dear Lord! and he thought of his two travelling companions in
the morning. . . .

For perhaps five minutes he stood there silently, and then he turned
back into the room.  It had come to him quite clearly that Philip
Vernon had indeed made good; that the real tragedy would have been his
return to "Sea View."  By his death he had justified himself; in his
life he would have failed. . . .  For he had been branded with the
brand of Culman Terrace, and there is no need to say more.  He was
relieved to see that Mrs. Vernon was quite composed again.  He had
performed the first part of his mission, and now the second required
tackling.  And something warned him that he would have to tread very
delicately; any suspicion of the word charity would be fatal to
success. . . .

"About your eldest boy, Mrs. Vernon," he began; "your husband often
spoke about him to me.  Let me see--what age is he?"

"Jack is fifteen, Captain Vane," she said quietly.

"Fifteen!  Couldn't be better.  Now I was wondering, Mrs. Vernon,
whether you would care in a year or two, to let him come to me.  I'm in
a very big business in the City, and my boss is always on the look out
for bright boys.  I know your boy is clever--but so much depends on
getting a good start these days.  Of course he'd be judged entirely on
his merits . . . but he'd start with a real good chance of making the
best of his talents."  He looked quickly at her, and found she was
watching him gravely.  "It's part of the privilege of the brotherhood
of the trenches, Mrs. Vernon, to be allowed to make such an
offer. . . ."  He was finding it easier now.  "To do anything for your
husband's son would be a real pleasure; though, I need hardly say that,
beyond giving him the chance, I could offer nothing else.  It would be
up to him to make good."

For a while Mrs. Vernon was silent, and he flashed a quick look at her.
Had he put it well?  Had he kept every suspicion of patronage out of
his offer?

"Thank you very much, Captain Vane," she said at last, "for your offer.
I hope you won't think me ungrateful when I refuse.  Four years ago I
think I should have accepted it with gratitude; but now . . ."  She
shook her head  "A lot of the shams have gone; we see clearer--some of
us. . . .  And I tell you that I would not willingly condemn Jack to
such a life as his father led--even if I was penniless.  Wait--let me
finish"--as Vane started to speak--"Of course with you he would have
better chances than his father had before him--but the city life would
kill him--even as it has killed thousands of others. . . .  I wonder if
you can realise the hideous tragedy of the poor clerk.  He can't strike
for higher wages, like the British working man.  He just goes on and on
and suffers in silence. . . .  In Jack's case it would be the
same. . . .  What--four hundred a year?"  She laughed a little
scornfully.  "It's not much to bring up a family on, Captain
Vane. . . .  Four hundred a year, and Acacia Avenue--two streets
up. . . .  Acacia Avenue doesn't call on Culman Terrace, you
know. . . ."  Again she laughed.  "No, Jack isn't made for that sort of
life, thank God.  He aches for the big spaces in his boyish way, for
the lands where there are big things to be done. . . .  And I've
encouraged him.  There'll be nobody there to sneer if his clothes get
frayed and he can't buy any more--because of the children's boots.
There'll be no appearances to keep up there.  And I'd a thousand times
rather that Jack should stand--or fall--in such surroundings, than that
he should sink slowly . . . here."

She paused for a moment, and then stood up and faced him.  "It's
emigration, Captain Vane, that I and people like me have got to turn to
for our boys.  For ourselves--it doesn't much matter; we've had our
day, and I don't want you to think the sun never shined on us, for it
did. . . .  Just wonderfully at times. . . ."  She gave a quick sigh.
"Only now . . . things are different. . . .  And up till now, Culman
Terrace hasn't considered emigration quite the thing.  It's not quite
respectable. . . .  Only aristocratic ne'er-do-wells and quite
impossibly common men emigrate.  It's a confession of failure. . . .
And so we've continued to swell the ranks of the most pitiful class in
the country--the gentleman and his family with the small fixed income.
The working man regards him with suspicion because he wears a black
coat--or, with contempt because he doesn't strike; the Government
completely ignores him because they know he's too much a slave to
convention to do anything but vote along so-called gentlemanly lines.
What do you suppose would be the result if the enormous body of middle
class slaves in this country did, one day, combine and refuse to be
bled by every other class?   We're bled by the people on top for their
own advantage; and then we're bled again for the advantage of the dear
workman. . . ."  She laughed a little.  "Forgive me talking so much;
but not for Jack, thank you."

Vane bowed.  "Mrs. Vernon, I think you're perfectly right--and I wish
you and him the very best of luck."  He shook hands gravely and a few
moments later he was walking back towards the station with Binks
trotting sedately at his heels.  In all probability he would never see
Mrs. Vernon again; war and its aftermath had brought their paths
together for a space, and now they were diverging again.  But that
short space had been enough to make him feel ashamed and proud.
Ashamed of himself for his cynicism and irritability; proud of the
woman who, with her faith clear and steadfast, could face the future
without faltering.  Her man's job had been laid upon her; she would
never fail him till the time came for her to join him. . . .  And by
then she would have earned her reward--rest. . . .  She will deserve
every moment of it. . . .  Surely the Lord of True Values will not
grudge it to her. . . .

And though he had said nothing to her of his thoughts--men when deeply
moved are so hopelessly inarticulate--somehow he wished going up in the
train that he had.  Falteringly, crudely, he might have said something,
which would have helped her.  If only a man had the power of expressing
sympathy without words.  He needn't have worried, had he known . . .
and Binks, who was looking out of the window with interest, could not
tell him.  Anyway, it was not anything to make a song or dance
about--putting a cold wet nose into a hand that hung down from a chair,
and letting it rest there--just for a while. . . .  But it was not the
first time, and it will not be the last, that the Peace that passeth
all understanding has been brought to the human heart by the touch of a
dog. . . .  Binks had justified his inclusion in the trip. . . .


CHAPTER VII

The days that followed passed pleasantly enough.  Gradually the
jaundice was disappearing, and Vane was becoming normal again.  The war
seemed very far away from Rumfold; though occasionally a newcomer
brought some bit of intimate gossip about Crucifix Alley or Hell Fire
Corner, or one of the little places not shown on any map, which mean so
much more to the actual fighting man than all the big towns rolled
together.  Pipes would come out and men would draw together in the
smoking-room--while in imagination the green flares would go hissing up
again, silhouetted against the velvet of the night.  But for the most
part the war had ceased to count; tennis and golf, with a visit now and
then to London, filled the days.

Vane's arm prevented him playing any game, but the country around was
admirably suited for walking, and most afternoons he found himself
strolling out past the lodge gates for a ramble.  Sometimes one of the
other officers accompanied him; but more often he went alone.  Peter_
to head back north.

In a few days, Bering was confined to bed with that overwhelming physical
depression and fear, that precede the scourge most dreaded by seamen--scurvy.
Lieutenant Waxel now took command. Waxel had all a sailor's
contempt for the bookful blockheads, who wrench fact to fit theory; and
deadly enmity arose {25} between him and Steller, the scientist. By
the middle of July, the fetid drinking water was so reduced that the
crew was put on half allowance; but on the sleepy, fog-blanketed
swell of the Pacific slipping past Bering's wearied eyes, there
were so many signs of land--birds, driftwood, seaweed--that the
commander ordered the ship hove to each night for fear of grounding.

On the thirteenth of July, the council of underlings had so far
relinquished all idea of a Gamaland, that it was decided to steer
continuously north. Sometime between the 16th and 20th, the fog
lifted like a curtain. Such a vision met the gaze of the stolid seamen
as stirred the blood of those phlegmatic Russians. It was the consummation
of all their labor, what they had toiled across Siberia to see,
what they had hoped against hope in spite of the learned jargon of the
geographers. There loomed above the far horizon of the north sea what
might have been an immense opal dome suspended in mid-heaven. One can
guess how the lookout strained keen eyes at this grand, crumpled
apex of snow jagged through the clouds like the celestial tent peak of
some giant race; how the shout of "land" went up, how officers and
underlings flocked round Bering with cries and congratulations.

"We knew it was land beyond a doubt on the sixteenth," says Steller.
"Though I have been in Kamchatka, I have never seen more lofty mountains."
The shore was broken everywhere, showing inlets and harbors. {26}
Everybody congratulated the commander, but he only shrugged shoulders,
saying: "We think we've done big things, eh? but who knows? Nobody
realizes where this is, or the distance we must sail back. Winds may
be contrary. We don't know this land; and we haven't provisions to
winter."
The truth is--the maps having failed, Bering was good enough
seaman to know these uncharted signs of a continent indicated that
the _St.

Peter_ was hopelessly lost. Sixteen years of nagging care, harder to
face than a line of cannon, had sucked Bering's capacity of resistance
like a vampire. That buoyancy, which lifts man above Anxious Fright,
had been sapped. The shadowy elemental powers--physical weakness,
disease, despair--were closing round the explorer like the waves of
an eternal sea.

The boat found itself in a wonder world, that beggared romance. The
great peak, which they named St.

Elias, hung above a snowy row of lesser ridges in a dome of alabaster.
Icebergs, like floating palaces, came washing down from the long line
of precipitous shore. As they neared anchorage at an island now known
as Kyak, they could see billows of ferns, grasses, lady's slippers,
rhododendrons, bluebells, forget-me-nots, rippling in the wind. Perhaps
they saw those palisades of ice, that stretch like a rampart northward
along the main shore west of St. Elias.

The _St. Peter_ moved slowly landward against a head wind. Khitroff and
Steller put off in the small {27} boats with fifteen men to
reconnoitre.

Both found traces of inhabitants--timbered huts, fire holes, shells,
smoked fish, footprints in the grass.

Steller left some kettles, knives, glass beads, and trinkets in the
huts to replace the possessions of the natives, which the Russians
took.

Many years later, another voyager met an old Indian, who told of seeing
Bering's ship anchor at Kyak Island when he was a boy; but the terrified
Indians had fled, only returning to find the presents in the huts,
when the Russians had gone.[13] Steller was as wild as a child out
of school, and accompanied by only one Cossack went bounding over
the island collecting specimens and botanizing.

Khitroff, meanwhile, filled water-casks; but on July 21, the day after
the anchorage, a storm-wind began whistling through the
rigging. The rollers came washing down from the ice wall of the coast
and the far offing showed the dirty fog that portended storm. Only half
the water-casks had been filled; but there was a brisk seaward
breeze.

Without warning, contrary to his custom of consulting the other
officers, Bering appeared on deck pallid and ashen from disease,
and peremptorily ordered anchors up.

In vain Steller stormed and swore, accusing the chief of pusillanimous
homesickness, "of reducing his explorations to a six hours' anchorage
on an island shore," "of coming from Asia to carry home American
water."

The commander had had enough of {28} vacillation, delay, interference.
One-third of the crew was ailing. Provisions for only three months
were in the hold.

The ship was off any known course more than two thousand miles from
any known port; and contrary winds might cause delay or drive the
vessel on the countless reefs that lined this strange coast, like
a ploughed field.

Dense clouds and a sleety rain settled over the sea, washing out every
outline, as the _St. Peter_ began her westward course. But what baffled
both Bering and the officers was the fact that the coast trended,
not north, but south.

They were coasting that long peninsula of Alaska that projects an
arm for a thousand miles southwestward into the Pacific.

The roar of the rollers came from the reefs.

Through the blanketing fog they could discern, on the north, island
after island, ghostlike through the mist, rocky, towering, majestic,
with a thunder of surf among the caves, a dim outline of mountains
above, like Loki, Spirit of Evil, smiling stonily at the dark forces
closing round these puny men.

All along Kadiak, the roily waters told of reefs. The air was heavy with
fogs thick to the touch; and violent winds constantly threatened
a sudden shift that might drive the vessel on the rocks. At midnight
on August 1, they suddenly found themselves with only three feet of
water below the keel. Fortunately there was no wind, but the fog was
like ink. By swinging into a current, that ran a mill-race, they
were carried out to eighteen fathoms {29} of water, where they
anchored till daybreak.

They called this place Foggy Island. To-day it is known as Ukamok.

[Illustration: The _St. Peter_ and _St. Paul_, from a rough sketch by
Bering's comrade, Steller, the scientist.]
The underlings now came sharply to their senses and, at the repeatedly
convened and distracted councils between July 25 and August 10,
decided that there was only one thing to do--sail at once for the
home port of Kamchatka.

The _St. Peter_ was tossing about in frightful winds among reefs and
hurricane fog like a cork.

Half the crew lay ill and helpless of scurvy, {30} and only two
months' provisions remained for a voyage of two thousand miles.

The whole crew signed the resolution to go home.

Only twenty-five casks of water remained. On August 30 the _St. Peter_
anchored off a group of thirteen bald, bare, treeless rocks.
It was thought that if some of the scurvy-stricken sailors could be
carried ashore, they might recover. One, Shumagin, died as he was
lifted ashore. This was the first death, and his name was given to the
islands. Bering himself was so ill he could not stand. Twenty
emaciated men were laid along the shore. Steller hurried off to hunt
anti-scorbutic plants, while Waxel, who had taken command, and
Khitroff ordered the water-casks filled.

Unfortunately the only pool they could find was connected with an arm
of the sea. The water was brackish, and this afterward increased
disease.

A fatality seemed to hang over the wonder world where they wandered.
Voices were heard in the storm, rumblings from the sea. Fire could be
seen through the fog. Was this fire from volcanoes or Indians? And
such a tide-rip thundered along the rocks as shook the earth and set the
ship trembling. Waxel knew they must not risk delay by going to
explore, but by applying to Bering, who lay in his berth unconscious
of the dangers on this coast, Khitroff gained permission to go
from the vessel on a yawl with five sailors; but by the time he had
rowed against head winds to the scene of the fire, the Indians had
{31} fled, and such beach combers were crashing ashore, Khitroff
dare not risk going back to the ship.

In vain Waxel ground his teeth with rage, signalled, and waited.

"The wind seemed to issue from a flue," says Steller, "with such
a whistling and roaring and rumbling that we expected to lose mast
and rudder, or be crushed among the breakers.
The dashings of the sea sounded like a cannon."
The fact was, Khitroff's yawl had been smashed to kindling wood against
the rocks; and the six half-drowned Russians were huddling together
waiting for help when Waxel took the other small boat and went to
the rescue.

Barely had this been effected at the cost of four days' delay, in which
the ship might have made five hundred miles toward home, when natives
were seen paddling out in canoes, gesticulating for the white men to
come ashore. Waxel lowered away in the small boat with nine armed
men to pay the savages a visit. Close ashore, he beckoned the Indians
to wade out; but they signalled him in turn to land, and he ordered
three men out to moor the boat to a rock.

All went well between Russians and Indians, presents being exchanged,
till a chief screwed up his courage to paddle out to Waxel in the boat.
With characteristic hospitality, Waxel at once proffered some Russian
brandy, which, by courtesy among all Western sailors, is always known
as "chain lightning." The chief took but one gulp of the liquid fire,
when with a wild yell he spat it out, shouted that he had been
poisoned, and dashed ashore

.

{32} The three Russians succeeded in gaining Waxel's boat, but the
Indians grabbed the mooring ropes and seized the Chukchee interpreter,
whom Waxel had brought from Siberia. Waxel ordered the rope cut, but
the Chukchee interpreter called out pitifully to be saved. Quick
as flash, the Russians fired two muskets in midair. At the crash that
echoed among the cliffs, the Indians fell prostrate with fear, and
the interpreter escaped; but six days had been wasted in this futile
visit to the natives.

Scarcely had they escaped this island, when such a hurricane broke over
the _St. Peter_ for seventeen days that the ship could only scud under
bare poles before a tornado wind that seemed to be driving north-northwest.
The ship was a chip in a maelstrom.

There were only fifteen casks of water fit to drink. All food was exhausted
but mouldy sea-biscuits. One sailor a day was now dying of scurvy,
and those left were so weak that they had no power to man the ship.
The sailors were so emaciated they had to be carried back and forward
to the rudder, and the underling officers were quarrelling among themselves.
The crew dared not hoist sails, because not a man of the _St. Peter_
had the physical strength to climb and lower canvas.[14]
{33} The rain turned to sleet. The sleet froze to the rotting sails,
to the ice-logged hull, to the wan yardarms frost-white like ghosts.

At every lurch of the sea slush slithered down from the rigging on the
shivering seamen.

The roar of the breakers told of a shallow sea, yet mist veiled the
sky, and they were above waters whose shallows drop to sudden abysmal
depths of three thousand fathoms. Sheets of smoking vapor rose from
the sea, sheets of flame-tinged smoke from the crevasses of land volcanoes
which the fogs hid. Out of the sea came the hoarse, strident
cry of the sea-lion, and the walrus, and the hairy seal. It was as if
the poor Russians had sailed into some under-world.
The decks were slippery as glass, the vessel shrouded in ice. Over all
settled that unspeakable dread of impending disaster, which is a
symptom of scurvy, and saps the fight that makes a man fit to
survive.

Waxel, alone, held the vessel up to the wind. Where were they? Why did
this coasting along unknown northern islands not lead to Kamchatka?

The councils were no longer the orderly conferences of savants over
cut-and-dried maps.

They were bedlam. Panic was in the marrow of every man, even the
passionate Steller, who thought all the while they were on the coast
of Kamchatka and made loud complaint that the expedition had been misled
by "unscrupulous leaders."

At eight o'clock on the morning of October 30 it was seen that the
ice-clogged ropes on the starboard {34} side had been snapped by
the wind like dry sticks.

Offerings, vows, prayers went up from the stricken crew. Piety became a
very real thing. The men prayed aloud and conferred on ways to win
the favor of God. The colder weather brought one relief. The fog
lifted and the air was clear. The wind veered northeast, and on
November 4, to their inexpressible joy, a dim outline sharpened to hard,
clear horizon; and the gazing crew gradually saw a high, mountainous
coast become clear beyond doubt directly ahead sixteen miles. Surely,
this was Kamchatka? Surely, God had heard their vows? The sick crawled
on hands and knees above the hatchway to see land once more, and
with streaming eyes thanked Heaven for the escape from doom.

Grief became joy; gruff, happy, hilarious laughter; for a few hidden
casks of brandy were brought out to celebrate the end of their miseries,
and each man began pointing out certain headlands that he thought
he recognized.

But this ecstasy was fool joy born of desperation. As the ship rounded
northeastward, a strangeness came over the scene; a chill over the
good cheer--a numbing, silent, unspeakable dread over the crew.

These turbulent waters running a mill-race between reefs looked more
like a channel between two islands than open coast.

The men could not utter a word. They hoped against hope. They dare not
voice their fears. That night, the _St. Peter_ stood off from land
in case of storm. Topsails were furled, and the wind had ripped the
other {35} sails to tatters, that flared and beat dismally all night
against the cordage. One can imagine the anxiety of that long night
with the roar of the breakers echoing angrily from shore, the whistle
of the wind through the rotten rigging, the creaking of the timbers
to the crash and growl and rebound of the tide.

Clear, refulgent with sunshine like the light of creation's first day,
the sting of ozone in the air, and the freshness of a scene never before
witnessed by human eyes--dawned the morning of November 5.

The shore was of black, adamant rock rising sheer from the sea in
a rampart wall.

Reefs, serried, rank on rank, like sentinels, guarded approach to the
coast in jagged masses, that would rip the bottom from any keel
like the teeth of a saw; and over these rolled the roaring breakers
with a clutch to the back-wash that bade the gazing sailors beware.

Birds, birds in myriads upon myriads, screamed and circled over the
eerie heights of the beetling cliffs.

This did not look like Kamchatka. These birds were not birds of the
Asiatic home port. These cliffs were not like the snow-rimmed
mountains of Avacha Bay.

Waxel called a council.

Officers and men dragged themselves to Bering's cabin. Waxel had
already canvassed all hands to vote for a landing to winter on these
shores.

This, the dying Bering opposed with all his might.

"We roust be almost home," he said. "We still have six casks of water,
and the _foremast_. Having risked so {36} much, let us risk three days
more, let us risk everything to reach Avacha Bay." Poor Bering! Had
his advice been followed, the saddest disaster of northern seas
might have been averted; for they were less than ten days' run from
the home harbor; but inspired by fool hopes born of fear, like the
old marsh lights that used to lure men to the quicksands--Waxel and
Khitroff actually persuaded themselves this _was_ Kamchatka, and
when one lieutenant, Ofzyn, who knew the north well from charting
the Arctic coast, would have spoken in favor of Bering's view, he
was actually clubbed and thrown from the cabin.

The crew voted as a man to land and winter on this coast.

Little did they know that vote was their own death warrant.

[2] Who this man _Gama_, supposed to have seen the unknown continent
of Gamaland, was, no one knew. The Portuguese followed the myth
blindly; and the other geographers followed the Portuguese.

Texeira, court geographer in Portugal, in 1649 issued a map with
a vague coast marked at latitude 45 degrees north, with the words "Land
seen by John de Gama, Indian, going from China to New Spain."
[3] These instructions were handed to Peter's admiral--Count Apraxin

.

[4] Born 1681, son of Jonas and Anna Bering, whom a petition describes,
in 1719, as "old, miserable, decrepit people, no way able to help
ourselves."

[5] He fought in Black Sea wars of 1711; and from lieutenant-captain
became captain of the second rank by 1717, when Russians, jealous of
the foreigner, blocked his promotion. He demanded promotion or
discharge, and withdrew to Finland, where the Czar's Kamchatkan
expedition called him from retirement.

[6] The expedition left St. Petersburg February 5th.

[7] The midshipman of this voyage was Peter Chaplin, whose journal was
deposited in the Naval College of the Admiralty, St. Petersburg. Berg
gives a summary of this journal.

A translation by Dall is to be found in _Appendix 19, Coast Survey,
Washington, 1890_.

[8] A great dispute has waged among the finical academists, where
the Serdze Kamen of this trip really was; the Russian observations
varying greatly owing to fog and rude instruments.

_Lauridsen_ quarrels with _Müller_ on this score. _Müller_ was one of
the theorists whose wrongheadedness misled Bering.

[9] It was in 1730 that Gvozdef's report of a strange land between 65
degrees and 66 degrees became current.

Whether this land was America, Gamaland, or Asia, the savants could not
know.

[10] It is from the works of _Gmelin_, _Müller_, and _Steller_, scientists
named to accompany the expedition, that the most connected
accounts are obtained.

The "menagerie," some one has called this collection of scientists.

[11] Many of the workmen died of their hardships at this stage of the
journey.

[12] Berg says Bering's two sons, Thomas and Unos, were also with him
in Siberia.

[13] _Sauer_ relates this incident.

[14] See _Müller_, p. 93, 1764 edition: "The men, notwithstanding
want, misery, sickness, were obliged to work continually in the
cold and wet, and the sickness was so dreadful that the sailors who
governed the rudder were obliged to be led to it by others, who
could hardly walk.

They durst not carry much sail, because there was nobody to lower
them in case of need, and they were so thin a violent wind would
have torn them to pieces.

The rain now changed to hail and snow."

CHAPTER II
1741-1743
CONTINUATION OF BERING, THE DANE
Frightful Sufferings of the Castaways on the Commander Islands--The
Vessel smashed in a Winter Gale, the Sick are dragged for Refuge
into Pits of Sand--Here, Bering perishes, and the Crew Winter--The
Consort Ship under Chirikoff Ambushed--How the Castaways reach Home
Without pilot or captain, the _St.

Peter_ drifted to the swirling current of the sea along a high,
rocky, forbidding coast where beetling precipices towered sheer
two thousand feet above a white fret of reefs, that gave the ocean
the appearance of a ploughed field. The sick crawled mutely back to
their berths. Bering was past caring what came and only semiconscious.
Waxel, who had compelled the crew to vote for landing here under the
impression born of his own despair,--that this was the coast of
Avacha Bay, Kamchatka,--saw with dismay in the shores gliding past
the keel momentary proofs that he was wrong. Poor Waxel had fought
desperately against the depression that precedes scurvy; but now,
with a dumb hopelessness settling over the ship, the invisible hand
of the scourge {38} was laid on him, too. He went below decks completely
fordone.

The underling officers still upon their feet, whose false theories
had led Bering into all this disaster, were now quarrelling furiously
among themselves, blaming one another. Only Ofzyn, the
lieutenant, who had opposed the landing, and Steller, the scientist,
remained on the lookout with eyes alert for the impending destruction
threatened from the white fret of the endless reefs.

Rocks rose in wild, jagged masses out of the sea.

Deep V-shaped ravines, shadowy in the rising moonlight, seemed to
recede into the rock wall of the coast, and only where a river
poured out from one of these ravines did there appear to be any gap
through the long lines of reefs where the surf boomed like thunder.

The coast seemed to trend from northwest to southeast, and might have
been from thirty to fifty miles long, with strange bizarre arches
of rock overhanging endless fields of kelp and seaweed. The
land was absolutely treeless except for willow brushwood the size of
one's finger. Lichens, moss, sphagnum, coated the rocks. Inland appeared
nothing but billowing reaches of sedges and shingle and grass.

I've got to be
up and doing myself--actively; to be merely any man's echo--his
complement--however much I loved him, would not be enough.  I've come
to that, you see.

And so I've decided--not quite definitely as I said, but almost so--to
read for Medicine.  I'm a little old, perhaps, though I'm only
twenty-four: but these years in France have at any rate not been
wasted.  The question of money does not come in luckily, and the work
attracts me immensely.  Somehow I feel that I might be helping to
repair a tiny bit of the hideous destruction and mutilation which we're
suffering from now.

And that's enough about myself.  I want to suggest something to you.
You may laugh, old boy--but I'm in earnest.  I remember you're telling
me once that, when you were up at the 'Varsity, you used to scribble a
bit.  I didn't pay much attention; in those days one didn't pay
attention--ever.  But now your words have come back to me once or
twice, during the night, when I've been seeing dream pictures in my
reading lamp and the ward has been asleep.  Have you thought that
possibly that is the line along which you might develop?  Don't you
think it's worth trying, Derek?  And then, perhaps--this is my wildest
dream, the raving of a fevered brain--the day will come when you and I
can stand together and realise that each of us in our own way has made
good--has done something to help on--_les autres_.  Oh!  Derek--it's
worth trying, old man--surely it's worth trying.  We've just got to do
something that's worth while, before we come to the end--if only to
balance a little of the hideous mass of worthlessness that's being
piled up to-day. . . .

Don't bother to answer this, as I know you find writing difficult.  I
hope to be getting some leave soon: we can have a talk then.  How goes
the arm?  _A toi, mon cheri_.

MARGARET.

PS.--There's rather a dear man living fairly close to Rumfold, old Sir
James Devereux.  His house is Blandford--a magnificent old place;
almost if not quite as fine as Rumfold, and the grounds are bigger.
His wife died when the son was born, and I rather think there is a
daughter, but she was away at a finishing school when I knew them, Go
over and call; from what I heard there's a distinct shortage of
money--at least of enough to keep the place going.

P.PS.--He's not really old--about only fifty.  Investing one fort with
his warriors, so as to cut off all communication with the others,
and to leave no hope of succor, his practice was to offer terms of
surrender, which never were kept in the honorable spirit in which
the far more noble and generous Tecumseh always acted with his
enemies, and thus, in turn, seven of these outposts fell victims
to their confidence in his truth.

Detroit and Michilimaclcinac, or Mackinaw as it is now called, remained,
and all the ingenuity of the chieftain was directed to the possession
of these strongholds. The following plan, well worthy of his invention,
was at length determined upon. During a temporary truce, and while
Ponteac was holding forth proposals for an ultimate and durable peace,
a game of lacrosse was arranged by him to take place simultaneously
on the common or clearing on which rested the forts of Michilimackinac
and Detroit.
The better to accomplish their object, the guns of the warriors had been
cut short and given to their women, who were instructed to conceal
them under their blankets, and during the game, and seemingly without
design, to approach the drawbridge of the fort. This
precaution taken, the players were to approach and throw over their
ball, permission to regain which they presumed would not be denied. On
approaching the drawbridge they were with fierce yells to make a general
rush, and, securing the arms concealed by the women, to massacre the
unprepared garrison.

The day was fixed; the game commenced, and was proceeded with in the
manner previously arranged. The ball was dexterously hurled into the
fort, and permission asked to recover it. It was granted. The
drawbridge was lowered, and the Indians dashed forward for the accomplishment
of their work of blood. How different the results in the two garrisons!
At Detroit, Ponteac and his warriors had scarcely crossed the drawbridge
when, to their astonishment and disappointment, they beheld the guns of
the ramparts depressed--the artillerymen with lighted matches at their
posts and covering the little garrison, composed of a few companies
of the 42nd Highlanders, who were also under arms, and so distributed
as to take the enemy most at an advantage. Suddenly they withdrew
and without other indication of their purpose than what had been
expressed in their manner, and carried off the missing ball. Their
design had been discovered and made known by means of significant
warnings to the Governor by an Indian woman who owed a debt of
gratitude to his family, and was resolved, at all hazards, to
save them.

On the same day the same artifice was resorted to at Michilimackinac,
and with the most complete success.
There was no guardian angel there to warn them of danger, and all
fell beneath the rifle, the tomahawk, the war-club, and the knife, one
or two of the traders--a Mr. Henry among the rest--alone excepted.

It was not long after this event when the head of the military authorities
in the Colony, apprised of the fate of these captured posts, and
made acquainted with the perilous condition of Fort Detroit, which
was then reduced to the last extremity, sought an officer who would
volunteer the charge of supplies from Albany to Buffalo, and thence
across the lake to Detroit, which, if possible, he was to relieve.

If she really
loved the thought of such a life she would just do it. . . .  And she
would succeed.  As far as he was concerned there would be nothing more
to say about it; she had a perfect right to decide for herself.  She
left him free--that he knew; he could still carry out his hunting box
programme in full.  Only he would have to play the part alone--or with
someone else. . . .  Someone else.  Abruptly he rose from his chair,
and found himself face to face with Lady Patterdale. . . .

"Good morning, Captain Vane," she remarked affably.  "'Ad a good night?"

"Splendid, thank you, Lady Patterdale."

"Ain't the news splendid?  Marshal Foch seems to be fair making the
'Uns 'um."

Vane laughed.  "Yes, they seem to be sitting up and taking notice,
don't they?"

"Sir John is marking it all up in the 'All on the map, with flags,"
continued the worthy old woman.  "I can't make 'ead or tail of it all
myself--but my 'usband likes to 'ave everything up to date.  'E can't
form any real opinion on the strategy, he says, unless he knows where
everybody is."

Vane preserved a discreet silence.

"But as I tells 'im," rambled on Lady Patterdale, "it doesn't seem to
me to be of much account where the poor fellows are.  You may move a
pin from 'ere to there, and feel all pleased and joyful about it--but
you wouldn't feel so 'appy if you was the pin."

Vane laughed outright.  "You've got a way of putting things, Lady
Patterdale, which hits the nail on the head each time."

"Ah! you may laugh, Captain Vane.  You may think I'm a silly old woman
who doesn't know what she's talking about.  But I've got eyes in my
'ead; and I'm not quite a fool.  I've seen young men go out to France
laughing and cheerful; and I've seen 'em come back.  They laugh just as
much--perhaps a bit more; they seem just as cheerful--but if you love
'em as I do you come to something which wasn't never there before.
They've been one of the pins.  Lots of us 'ave been one of the pins,
Captain Vane; though we ain't been to France you can lose other things
besides your life in this world."

She nodded her head at him solemnly and waddled on, while Vane stood
for a moment looking after her.  Assuredly this common old woman
possessed in her some spark of the understanding which is almost
Divine. . . .  And Vane, with a quick flash of insight, saw the proud
planting of the pin on Rumfold Hall--a strategic advance, but the
casualty list had never been published. . . .

He strolled along the veranda and into the hall.  Sir John with a very
small audience--mostly newcomers--around him was holding forth on the
new developments in France and Vane paused for a moment to listen.

"You mark my words, me boys," he was saying, "this is the big thing.  I
put my trust in Foch: he's the fellow who's got my money on him.  No
nonsense about Foch.  Of course it's going to be costly, but you can't
have omelettes without breaking eggs.  An old proverb, me boys--but a
true one."

"More than true, Sir John," remarked Vane quietly.  "And one that from
time immemorial has proved an immense comfort to the egg."

He went on up to his room.  It was too early yet to start for
Blandford, but Vane was in no mood for his own thoughts.  They had
reached a stage, indeed, whence he preferred not to follow them
further.  Doubtless by the time Margaret returned on leave, the beaten
track would have revealed itself; until then--_cui bono_? . . . .

He looked at his watch, and it occurred to him that he would just have
comfortable time to pay a visit to old John before starting on his walk
through the woods.  From Robert he had found out where the old man was
living in the village, and, a few minutes later, he was strolling down
the drive towards his house.  In ten days the wan, gaunt {199}
sailors were so sleek and fat that even the generous entertainers
had to laugh at the transformation. Old King Terreeoboo came
clothed in a cloak of gaudy feathers with spears and daggers at
his belt and a train of priestly retainers at his heels to pay a
visit of state to Cook; and a guard of mariners was drawn up at
arms under the cocoanut grove to receive the visitor with fitting
honor.

When the king learned that Cook was to leave the bay early in February,
a royal proclamation gathered presents for the ships; and Cook
responded by a public display of fireworks.

Now it is a sad fact that when a highly civilized people meet an uncivilized
people, each race celebrates the occasion by appropriating all the
evil qualities of the other.

Vices, not virtues, are the first to fraternize. It was as unfair of
Cook's crew to judge the islanders by the rabble swarming out
to steal from the ships, as it would be for a newcomer to judge the
people of New York by the pickpockets and under-world of the water
front. And it must not be forgotten that the very quality that
had made Cook successful--the quality to dare--was a danger to him here.
The natives did not violate the sacred _taboo_, which the priest
had drawn round the white men's quarters of the grove.

It was the white men who violated it by going outside the limit;
and the conduct of the white sailors for the sixteen days in port
was neither better nor worse than the conduct of sailors to-day who
go on a wild spree with the lowest elements of the harbor. {200}
The savages were quick to find out that the white gods were after
all only men.

The true story of what happened could hardly be written by Captain King,
who finished Cook's journal; though one can read between the lines
King's fear of his commander's rashness. The facts of the case are given
by the young American, John Ledyard, of Connecticut, who was corporal
of marines and in the very thick of the fight.

At the end of two weeks the white seamen were, perhaps, satiated
of their own vices, or suffering from the sore head that results
from prolonged spreeing.

At all events the thieving, which had been condoned at first, was now
punished by soundly flogging the natives.
The old king courteously hinted it was time for the white men to
go.
The mate, who was loading masts and rudder back on board the _Resolution_,
asked the savages to give him a hand. The islanders had lost respect
for the white men of such flagrant vices.

They pretended to give a helping hand, but only jostled the mate about
in the crowd.

The Englishman lost his temper, struck out, and blustered. The shore
rang with the shrill laughter of the throngs. In vain the chiefs of
authority interposed. The commands to help the white men were answered
by showers of stones directly inside the _taboo_.

Ledyard was ordered out with a guard of sailors to protect the white
men loading the _Resolution_. The guard was pelted black and blue. "There
was nothing to do," relates Ledyard, "but move to new lands where
our vices {201} were not known." At last all was in readiness to sail--one
thing alone lacking--wood; and the white men dare not go inland
for the needed wood.

So far the entire blame rested on the sailors. Now Cook committed his
cardinal error.

With that very dare and quickness to utilize every available means to an
end--whether the end justified the means--Cook ordered his men ashore
to seize the rail fence round the top of the stone burying-ground--the
sacred Morai--as fuel for his ships. Out rushed the priests from
the enclosure in dire distress. Was this their reward for protecting
Cook with the wand of the sacred _taboo_? Two hatchets were offered
the leading priest as pay. He spurned them as too loathsome to be
touched. Leading the way, Cook ordered his men to break the fence down,
and proffered three hatchets, thrusting them into the folds of the
priest's garment.

Pale and quivering with rage, the priest bade a slave remove the
profaning iron.

Down tumbled the fence!
Down the images on poles!

Down the skulls of the dead sacred to the savage as the sepulchre to
the white man! It may be said to the credit of the crew, that the men
were thoroughly frightened at what they were ordered to do; but
they were not too frightened to carry away the images as relics.

Cook alone was blind to risk. As if to add the last straw to the
Hawaiians' endurance, when the ships unmoored and sailed out from the
bay, where but two weeks before they had been so royally welcomed,
they carried {202} eloping wives and children from the lower classes
of the two villages.

It was one of the cases where retribution came so swift it was like
a living Nemesis.

If the weather had continued fair, doubtless wives and children would
have been dumped off at some near harbor, the incident considered a joke,
and the Englishmen gone merrily on their way; but a violent gale
arose.

Women and children were seized with a seasickness that was no joke. The
decks resounded with such wails that Cook had to lie to in the storm,
put off the pinnace, and send the visitors ashore.

What sort of a tale they carried back, we may guess. Meanwhile
the storm had snapped the foremast of the _Resolution_.

As if rushing on his ruin, Cook steered back for the bay and
anchored midway between the two villages. Again the tents were pitched
beside the Morai under the cocoanut groves. Again the wand was drawn
round the tenting place; but the white men had taught the savages
that the _taboo_ was no longer sacred.

Where thousands had welcomed the ships before, not a soul now appeared.
Not a canoe cut the waters. Not a voice broke the silence of the
bay.

The sailors were sour; Cook, angry. When the men rowed to the villages
for fresh provisions, they were pelted with stones. When at
night-time the savages came to the ships with fresh food, they asked
higher prices and would take only daggers and knives in pay.
Only by firing its great guns could the {203} _Discovery_ prevent
forcible theft by the savages offering provisions; and in the scuffle
of pursuit after one thief, Pareea--a chief most friendly to the
whites--was knocked down by a white man's oar. "I am afraid," remarked
Cook, "these people will compel me to use violent measures." As if to
test the mettle of the tacit threat, Sunday, daybreak, February 14,
revealed that the large rowboat of the _Discovery_ had been stolen.

When Captain King, who had charge of the guard repairing the masts over
under the cocoanut grove came on board Sunday morning, he found
Cook loading his gun, with a line of soldiers drawn up to go ashore
in order to allure the ruler of the islands on board, and hold him
as hostage for the restitution of the lost boat.

Clerke, of the _Discovery_, was too far gone in consumption to take any
part.

Cook led the way on the pinnace with Ledyard and six marines. Captain
King followed in the launch with as many more. All the other small
boats of the two ships were strung across the harbor from
Kakooa, where the grove was, to Kowrowa, where the king dwelt,
with orders to fire on any canoe trying to escape.

Before the fearless leader, the savages prostrated themselves in the
streets. Cook strode like a conqueror straight to the door of the
king's abode.

It was about nine in the morning.

Old Terreeoboo--peace lover and lazy--was just awake and only too willing
to go aboard with Cook as the easiest way out {204} of the trouble
about the stolen boat.

But just here the high-handedness of Cook frustrated itself. That line
of small boats stretched across the harbor began firing at an escaping
canoe. A favorite chief was killed. Word of the killing came as the old
king was at the water's edge to follow Cook; and a wife caught him by
the arm to drag him back. Suddenly a throng of a thousand surrounded
the white men. Some one stabs at Phillips of the marines.
Phillips's musket comes down butt-end on the head of the assailant. A
spear is thrust in Cook's very face. He fires blank shot. The harmlessness
of the shot only emboldens the savages. Women are seen hurrying off
to the hills; men don their war mats. There is a rush of the
white men to get positions along the water edge free for striking
room; of the savages to prevent the whites' escape. A stone hits
Cook.
"What man did that?" thunders Cook; and he shoots the culprit dead.
Then the men in the boats lose their heads, and are pouring volleys of
musketry into the crowds.

"It is hopeless," mutters Cook to Phillips; but amid a shower of stones
above the whooping of the savages, he turns with his back to the
crowd, and shouts for the two small boats to cease firing and pull
in for the marines.

His caution came too late.

His back is to his assailants. An arm reached out--a hand with a dagger;
and the dagger rips quick as a flash under Cook's shoulder-blade.
He fell without a groan, face in the water, and was hacked to pieces
{205} before the eyes of his men. Four marines had already fallen.
Phillips and Ledyard and the rest jumped into the sea and swam for
their lives. The small boats were twenty yards out.
Scarcely was Phillips in the nearest, when a wounded sailor, swimming
for refuge, fainted and sank to the bottom.

Though half stunned from a stone blow on his head and bleeding from a
stab in the back, Phillips leaped to the rescue, dived to bottom, caught
the exhausted sailor by the hair of the head and so snatched him into
the boat. The dead and the arms of the fugitives had been
deserted in the wild scramble for life.

[Illustration: The Death of Cook.]

Meanwhile the masts of the _Resolution_, guarded by {206} only six
marines, were exposed to the warriors of the other village at the
cocoanut grove. Protected by the guns of the two ships under the
direction of Clerke, who now became commander, masts and men were
got aboard by noon. At four that afternoon, Captain King rowed toward
shore for Cook's body. He was met by the little leprous priest
Koah, swimming halfway out. Though tears of sorrow were in Koah's
treacherous red-rimmed eyes as he begged that Clerke and King might
come ashore to parley. King judged it prudent to hold tightly on the
priest's spear handle while the two embraced.

Night after night for a week, the conch-shells blew their challenge
of defiance to the white men.

Fires rallying to war danced on the hillsides. Howls and shouts of
derision echoed from the shore.

The stealthy paddle of treacherous spies could be heard through the
dark under the keel of the white men's ships.

Cook's clothing, sword, hat, were waved in scorn under the sailors'
faces. The women had hurried to the hills.

The old king was hidden in a cave, where he could be reached only by a
rope ladder; and emissary after emissary tried to lure the whites ashore.
One pitch-dark night, paddles were heard under the keels. The sentinels
fired; but by lantern light two terrified faces appeared above the
rail of the _Resolution_.

Two frightened, trembling savages crawled over the deck, prostrated
themselves at Clerke's feet, and slowly unrolled a small wrapping of
cloth that revealed a small {207} piece of human flesh--the
remains of Cook.

Dead silence fell on the horrified crew. Then Clerke's stern answer was
that unless the bones of Cook were brought to the ships, both native
villages would be destroyed. The two savages were former friends of
Cook's and warned the whites not to be allured on land, nor to trust
Koah, the leper priest, on the ships.

Again the conch-shells blew their challenge all night through the darkness.
Again the war fires danced; but next morning the guns of the _Discovery_
were trained on Koah, when he tried to come on board. That day sailors
were landed for water and set fire to the village of the cocoanut
groves to drive assailants back.

How quickly human nature may revert to the beast type! When the white
sailors returned from this skirmish, they carried back to the ships with
them, the heads of two Hawaiians they had slain. By Saturday, the 20th,
masts were in place and the boats ready to sail. Between ten and
eleven o'clock in the morning, a long procession of people was seen
filing slowly down the hills preceded by drummers and a white flag.
Word was signalled that Cook's bones were on shore to be delivered.
Clerke put out in a small boat to receive the dead commander's
remains--from which all flesh had been burned.

On Sunday, the 21st, the entire bay was tabooed. Not a native came out
of the houses. Silence lay over the waters. The funeral service was
read on board the _Resolution_, and the coffin committed to the deep.

{208} A curious reception awaited the ships at Avacha Bay, Kamchatka,
whence they now sailed. Ismyloff's letter commending the explorers
to the governor of Avacha Bay brought thirty Cossack soldiers
floundering through the shore ice of Petropaulovsk under the
protection of pointed cannon.

Ismyloff, with fur trader's jealousy of intrusion, had warned the
Russian commander that the English ships were pirates like Benyowsky,
the Polish exile, who had lately sacked the garrisons of Kamchatka,
stolen the ships, and sailed to America. However, when Cook's letters
were carried overland to Bolcheresk, to Major Behm, the commander,
all went well.

The little log-thatched fort with its windows of talc opened wide
doors to the far-travelled English.

The Russian ladies of the fort donned their China silks. The samovars
were set singing. English sailors gave presents of their grog to the
Russians. Russian Cossacks presented their tobacco to the English,
adding three such cheers as only Cossacks can give and a farewell
song.

In 1779 Clerke made one more attempt to pass through the northern
ice-fields from Pacific to Atlantic; but he accomplished nothing but
to go over the ground explored the year before under Cook.

On the 5th of July at ten P.M. in the lingering sunlight of northern
latitudes, just as the boats were halfway through the Straits of
Bering, the fog lifted, and for the first time in history--as far
as known--the westernmost part of America, Cape Prince of Wales,
and the {209} eastern-most part of Asia, East Cape, were simultaneously
seen by white men.

Finding it impossible to advance eastward, Clerke decided there was
no Northeast Passage by way of the Pacific to the Atlantic; and on
the 21st of July, to the cheers of his sailors, announced that the
ships would turn back for England.[3]
Poor Clerke died of consumption on the way, August 22, 1779, only
thirty-eight years of age, and was buried at Petropaulovsk beside
La Croyére de l'Isle, who perished on the Bering expedition. The boats
did not reach England till October of 1780. They had not won the reward
of twenty thousand pounds; but they had charted a strange coast for a
distance of three thousand five hundred miles, and paved the way for the
vast commerce that now plies between Occident and Orient.[4]

[1] The question may occur, why in the account of Cook's and Bering's
voyage, the latitude is not oftener given.

The answer is, the latitudes as given by Cook and Bering vary so much
from the modern, it would only confuse the reader trying to follow a
modern map.

[2] This is the Ismyloff who was marooned by Benyowsky.

[3] The authority for Cook's adventures is, of course, his own journal,
_Voyage to the Pacific Ocean_, London, 1784, supplemented by the
letters and journals of men who were with him, like Ledyard,
Vancouver, Portlock, and Dixon, and others

.

[4] In reiterating the impossibility of finding a passage from ocean to
ocean, either northeast or northwest, no disparagement is cast on
such feats as that of Nordenskjöld along the north of Asia, in the
_Vega_ in 1882.

By "passage" is meant a waterway practicable for ocean vessels, not for
the ocean freak of a specially constructed Arctic vessel that dodges
for a year or more among the ice-floes in an endeavor to pass from
Atlantic to Pacific, or _vice versa_

CHAPTER VIII

1785-1792
ROBERT GRAY, THE AMERICAN DISCOVERER OF THE COLUMBIA
Boston Merchants, inspired by Cook's Voyages, outfit two Vessels under
Kendrick and Gray for Discovery and Trade on the Pacific--Adventures
of the First Ship to carry the American Flag around the World--Gray
attacked by Indians at Tillamook Bay--His Discovery of the Columbia
River on the Second Voyage--Fort Defence and the First American Ship
built on the Pacific
It is an odd thing that wherever French or British fur traders went
to a new territory, they found the Indians referred to American
traders, not as "Americans," but "Bostons" or "_Bostonnais_."

The reason was plain. Boston merchants won a reputation as first to
act. It was they who began a certain memorable "Boston Tea Party"; and
before the rest of the world had recovered the shock of that event,
these same merchants were planning to capture the trade of the
Pacific Ocean, get possession of all the Pacific coast not already
preëmpted by Spain, Russia, or England, and push American commerce
across the Pacific to Asia

      .

{211} What with slow printing-presses and slow travel, the account
of Cook's voyages on the Pacific did not become generally known in
the United States till 1785 or 1786.

Sitting round the library of Dr.
Bulfinch's residence on Bowdoin Square in Boston one night in 1787,
were half a dozen adventurous spirits for whom Cook's account of
the fur trade on the Pacific had an irresistible fascination.

There was the doctor himself. There was his son, Charles, of Harvard,
just back from Europe and destined to become famous as an architect.
There was Joseph Barrell, a prosperous merchant.

There was John Derby, a shipmaster of Salem, a young man still, but
who, nevertheless, had carried news of Lexington to England.

Captain Crowell Hatch of Cambridge, Samuel Brown, a trader of
Boston, and John Marden Pintard of the New York firm of Lewis
Pintard Company were also of the little coterie.

Washington_.

If Captain Cook's crew had sold one-third of a water-rotted cargo
of otter furs in China for ten thousand dollars, why, these Boston
men asked themselves, could not ships fitted expressly for the fur
trade capture a fortune in trade on that unoccupied strip of coast
between Russian Alaska, on the north, and New Spain, on the south?

"There is a rich harvest to be reaped by those who are on the ground
first out there," remarked Joseph Barrell.

Then the thing was to be on the ground first--that {212} was the
unanimous decision of the shrewd-headed men gathered in Bulfinch's
study.

[Illustration: Charles Bulfinch.]
The sequence was that Charles Bulfinch and the other five at once
formed a partnership with a capital of fifty thousand dollars,
divided into fourteen shares, for trade on the Pacific.

This was ten years before Lewis and Clark reached the Columbia, almost
twenty years before Astor had thought of his Pacific Company. The Columbia,
a full-rigged two-decker, two hundred and twelve tons and eighty-three
feet long, mounting {213} ten guns, which had been built fourteen
years before on Hobart's Landing, North River, was immediately
purchased.

But a smaller ship to cruise about inland waters and collect furs was
also needed; and for this purpose the partners bought the _Lady
Washington_, a little sloop of ninety tons. Captain John Kendrick of the
merchant marine was chosen to command the _Columbia_, Robert Gray,
a native of Rhode Island, who had served in the revolutionary navy,
a friend of Kendrick's, to be master of the _Lady Washington_. Kendrick
was of middle age, cautious almost to indecision; but Gray was younger
with the daring characteristic of youth.

In order to insure a good reception for the ships, letters were obtained
from the federal government to foreign powers. Massachusetts furnished
passports; and the Spanish minister to the United States gave letters
to the viceroy of New Spain. Just how the information of Boston plans
to intrude on the Pacific coast was received by New Spain may be
judged by the confidential commands at once issued from Santa Barbara
to the Spanish officer at San Francisco: "_Whenever there may arrive
at the Port of San Francisco, a ship named the Columbia said to
belong to General Wanghington (Washington) of the American States,
under command of John Kendrick which sailed from Boston in September
1787 bound on a voyage of Discovery and of Examination of the Russian
Establishments on the Northern Coast of this Peninsula, you {214}
will cause said vessel to be secured together with her officers and
crew._"
Orders were also given Kendrick and Gray to avoid offence to any
foreign power, to treat the natives with kindness and Christianity,
to obtain a cargo of furs on the American coast, to proceed with
the same to China to be exchanged for a cargo of tea, and to return
to Boston with the tea.

The holds of the vessels were then stowed with every trinket that
could appeal to the savage heart, beads, brass buttons, ear-rings,
calico, tin mirrors, blankets, hunting-knives, copper kettles, iron
chisels, snuff, tobacco. The crews were made up of the very best class
of self-respecting sea-faring men. Woodruff, Kendrick's first mate, had
been with Cook. Joseph Ingraham, the second mate, rose to
become a captain.

Robert Haswell, the third mate, was the son of a British naval
officer.

Richard Howe went as accountant; Dr. Roberts, as surgeon; Nutting, formerly
a teacher, as astronomer; and Treat, as fur trader.

Davis Coolidge was the first mate under Gray on the _Lady Washington_.

Some heroes blunder into glory.

These didn't. They deliberately set out with the full glory of their
venture in view.
That would soon bring 'em to their senses. . . ."  Sir James
attacked his chicken viciously.

"What's going to happen," he went on after a moment, "when we return to
peace conditions?  The private employer can't pay these inflated
wages. . . .  He simply can't do it, and that's an end of it.  But now,
of necessity it's been a case of surrender--surrender--surrender to any
demands the blackguards like to put up.  And they've got it each time.
Do you suppose they're going to stop?"

"But surely there's such a thing as common sense," interrupted Vane.
"Surely the matter can be put in front of them so that they will
understand? . . .  If not, it's a pretty useful confession of
ineptitude."

Sir James laughed shortly.  "There are several floating round at the
moment. . . .  But it isn't quite as easy as all that, my dear fellow.
In times of unrest power comes automatically more and more into the
hands of the man who can talk; men like Ramage, and others of his
kidney.  A few meaningless but high flown phrases; a few such parrot
cries as 'Down with the Capitalist and the Future is for the Worker,'
and you've got even the steadiest man unsettled. . . .  Especially if
he's one of a crowd; mob psychology is the devil. . . ."  Sir James
paused and stared out of the window.  "I don't fear for the decent
fellow in the long run; it's in the early stages he may get
blown. . . ."

"What are you two men talking about so busily?"  Aunt Jane once again
presented her trumpet to Vane.

"Labour trouble, Miss Devereux," he roared.  "Trouble in the labour
market."

The old lady's face set grimly.  "My convictions on that are well
known," she boomed.  "Put them in a row against a wall and shoot them."

"My sister's panacea for all evil," said Sir James with a smile.

"There are others as well as Miss Devereux who would recommend the same
thing," said Vane with a short laugh.

"Shoot 'em," rasped the old lady; "shoot 'em, and go on shooting till
there are no more left to shoot.  I'm sure we'd get along very well
without the brutes."

"What's going to stop 'em?" Sir James returned to his former question.
"Nothing--until they've tried everything, and found they're wrong.  And
while they're finding out the simple fact that no employer can pay a
guinea for a pound's worth of work the country will crash.  We'll have
anarchy, Vane--Bolshevism like Russia, unless a miracle saves us. . . .
Financed by the Boche probably into the bargain."

"Dear old Daddy," laughed Joan.  "You're such an optimist, aren't you?"

"It's no laughing matter, my dear," snorted her father.  "There's a
wave of madness over the world . . . absolute madness.  The more you
give into them--the more decently you treat 'em--the more they
want. . . .  People talk about the old order changing; what I want to
know is what they're going to put in its place?  When they've broken up
the Empire and reduced England to a fifth-rate Power, they'll probably
want the old order back. . . .  It'll be too late to want then."

"I gather, Sir James, that you are not exactly a Socialist," murmured
Vane gravely, with a side glance at Joan.

His host rose to the bait.  "I--a Socialist--I!  Why--why! . . ." he
spluttered, and then he saw his daughter's face.  She was dimpling with
laughter, and suddenly Sir James laughed too.

"You nearly had me then, my boy," he cried; "very nearly.  But it's on
that point, Vane, that I get so wild with these intellectual men--men
who should know better.  Men like Ramage, and Johnson and all that lot.
They know themselves that Socialism is a wild impossibility; they know
that equality is out of the question, and yet they preach it to men who
have not got their brains.  It's a dangerously attractive doctrine; the
working man who sees a motor flash past him wouldn't be human if he
didn't feel a tinge of envy. . . .  But the Almighty has decreed that
it should be so: and it's flying in His Face to try to change it."

Vane looked thoughtfully at his host.  "I fancy the Almighty's dictates
are less likely to be questioned by the motor car owner than by the
working man."

"I agree with you, Vane," returned Sir James at once.  "But that
doesn't alter the principle of the thing. . . .  By all means improve
their conditions . . . give them better houses . . . stop sweated
labour.  That is our privilege and our duty.  But if they continue on
their present line, they'll soon find the difference.  Things we did
for 'em before, they'll have to whistle for in the future."

"You're getting your money's worth this time, aren't you, Captain
Vane?" said Joan demurely.

But Vane only smiled at her gravely and did not answer.  Here were the
views, crudely expressed, perhaps, of the ordinary landed gentleman.
The spirit of retaliation is not to be indulged in; a yieldingness
of spirit is to characterise the child of the kingdom; those who hate
and despitefully use us are to be pitied, and loved, and prayed
for. Then comes the direction, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as
your FATHER which is in heaven is perfect." In the little frictions
of daily life, as well as in the more serious trials and persecutions
to which the Christian is exposed, he is to be manifestly an imitator
of his heavenly FATHER.

Now, GOD'S perfection is an absolute perfection; while ours, at best,
is only relative. A needle may be a perfect needle, in every respect
adapted for the work for which it was made. It is not, however, a
microscopic object; under magnifying power it becomes a rough, honeycombed
poker, with a ragged hole in the place of the eye. But it was not made
to be a microscopic object; and, being adapted to the purpose for
which it was made, it may properly be considered a perfect needle. So
we are not called to be perfect angels, or in any respect Divine,
but we are called to be perfect Christians, performing the privileged
duties that as such devolve upon us.

Our FATHER makes according to His perfection the least little thing
that He makes.

The tiniest fly, the smallest animalcule, the dust of a butterfly's
wing, however highly you may magnify them, are seen to be absolutely
perfect. Should not the little things of our daily life be as relatively
perfect in the case of each Christian as the lesser creations of
GOD are absolutely perfect?

Ought we not to glorify GOD in the formation of each letter that
we write, and as Christians to write a more legible hand than
unconverted people can be expected to do?

Quiet and smiling in the warm sun, it lay there--a symbol of the thing
for which Englishmen have laid down their lives since time started.  At
that very second men were dying for it--over the water.  Also was to the
captain's interests to remain on good with in darkness settled
over the sea on the last night of September, Baranof was in the
same predicament as Bering--a castaway for the winter on a barren
island.

Instead of sinking under the of profit in the fur trade were current at
Irkutsk.

States in 1867 for seven million dollars of" drinking water was
reduced; and before the equinoctial gales, scurvy had already
disabled the crew.

Baranof Tired of stagnating in what was an absolutely safe but unutterably
monotonous life, Baranof left the factory and invested the Indians.

Anyway, the twenty captives were not restored till two other ships
had I entered port, and sent some Kolosh canoes to bottom with
grape-shot.

The savages were then search set free, and hastening up to Kadiak,
once Barber levelled his cannon at the Russian fort and demanded
thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars' salvage for to the
rescue of the captives and loot.

Baranof haggled the Englishman tired, and compromised for one-fifth the
demand.

Two years passed, and the fur company was powerless to strike an
avenging blow. Wherever the Russians led Aleuts into the Kolosh courage
again to follow the Russians eastward. By the spring of 1804 Baranof's
men had gathered up eight hundred Aleut Indians, one hundred and
twenty Russian hunters, four small schooners, and two knockabout.

The Indians in their light boats of sea-lion skin on whalebone, the
Russians in their sail-boats, Baranof set out in April from St.

Paul, Kadiak, with his thousand followers to wreak vengeance on the
tribes of Sitka.

Sea-otter were hunted on the way, so that it was well on in September
before the brigades entered Sitka waters. Meanwhile aid from an
unexpected quarter had come to the fur company. Lieutenant Krusenstern
had prevailed on the Russian government to send supplies to the Russian
American Company by two vessels around the world instead of caravans
across Siberia.

With Krusenstern went Rezanoff, who had helped the fur traders to
obtain their charter, and was now commissioned to open an embassy to
Japan. The second vessel under Captain Lisiansky proceeded at once to
Baranof's I aid at Sitka.

Baranof was hunting when Lisiansky's man-of-war entered the state of
Sitka Sound. The fur company's two sloops lay at anchor with lanterns
swinging bow and stern to guide the hunters home.

The eight hundred hostiles had fortified themselves behind the site of
the modern Sitka.

Palisades the depth of two spruce logs ran across the front of
the{312} rough barricade, loopholed for musketry, and protected by
a kind of cheval-de-frise of brushwood and spines.

At the rear of the enemy's fort ran sally ports leading to the ambush
of the woods, and inside were huts enough to house a small town. By the
28th of September Baranof's Aleut Indian hunters had come in and
camped alongshore under protection of cannon sent close inland on
a small boat only to be blown to bits by a cannon-shot.

The ships began to line up and land field-pieces for action, when a Sitkan
came out with overtures of peace. Baranof gave him the present of a gay
coat, told. On October the first a white flag was run up on ship of
war. No signal answered from the barricade. The Russian ships let blaze
all the cannon simultaneously, only to find that the double logs
of the barricade could not be penetrated.

No return fire came from the Sitkans.

Two small boats were then landed to destroy the enemy's{313} bakery. Still
from barricade.

Raging with impatience, Baranof ashore supported by one hundred and fifty
men, and with a wild halloo led the way to rush the fort. The hostile
Sitkans husbanded their property with a coolness equal to the
famous thin red get line of British fame.

Not a signal, not a sound water's edge, where the body of one dead
Russian was brandished on spear. ends.

In the sortie fourteen of the on Russian forces were killed,
twenty-six injure, among whom was Baranof, shot through the shoulder.

The guns of the war ship were all that saved the retreat from a panic
Lisiansky then undertook the campaign, letting drive such a brisk fire the
next day that the Sitkans came suing supplying them with brigades
of Aleut Island hunters for peace by the afternoon.

Three days the cunning savages stayed Russian on pretence of arranging
hostages.

Hailing the fort on the morning of the 6th and securing no answer,
Lisiansky again played his cannon on the barricade.

That night a curious sound, that was neither chant nor war-cry, came from
the thick woods.

At daylight carrion crows were seen circling above the barricade.

Three hundred Russians landed.

Approaching cautiously for fear of ambuscade, they Vane clambered over
the{314} palisades and looked. The fort was deserted. Naught of the

It was a weird scene that the Russian officers witnessed, the enemy's
fort, unlighted and silent as death, the Aleut hunters alongshore dancing
themselves into a frenzy of bravado, the spruce torches of the coast
against the impenetrable like fireflies in a thicket; an occasional
fugitive canoe from the enemy attempting to steal through the
darkness out of the harbor, of Sitka--Baranof, off in his Old Age,
houses dies of Broken Heart No wilder lord of the wild northland
ever existed than that old madcap Viking of the Pacific, Alexander
Baranof, governor of the Russian fur traders.

For thirty years he ruled over the west coast of America from Alaska
to southern California despotic as a czar.

And he played the game single-handed, no retinue but convicts from
Siberia, no subjects but hostile Indians. Whether leading the hunting
brigades of a thousand men over the sea in skin canoes light as
cork, or rallying his followers ambushed the first place. guests
He had been managing a glass factory at Irkutsk, Siberia, where the
endless caravans of fur traders passed.

Born at Kargopol not, East Russia, in 1747, of fiery Russian brandy in
midnight carousals hunting-grounds prevent their cries betraying the
retreat great authorities on the early Russian fur trade. Data on later
days; Greenhow, there had been ambush and massacre; but Baranof{311}
bided his time.

The Aleut Indian hunters, who had become panic-stricken, gradually
regained sufficient, Baranof was supreme some autocrat. Drunk or{317}
sober, he was master of whatever impatience he had drifted to Moscow,
set up in when a shop for at twenty-four, failed in business, and
emigrated to Siberia do at thirty-five.

Tales indomitable Baranof, who seemed to meet the challenge of the very
elements, the half-drowned crew crawled ashore only to be ordered to save
the cargo now rolling up in the wave wash.{320} When by hostiles
repelling invasion of their hunting-ground, or drowning ill-being with
came, mutineers or foreign traders planning to oust Russians from
the coast of America.

Baranof stood for all desireth that was best and all that was in that
heroic period of Pacific coast history when adventurers from all corners
of the earth roamed the otter-hunting grounds in quest of fortune.

Each man was a law unto himself. There was fear of neither man nor
devil. The whole era might have been a page from the hero epic of
prehistoric days when earth was young, and men ranged the seas unhampered
by conscience or custom, magnificent beasts of prey, glorying in
freedom and bloodshed and the warring elements.

[Illustration: Alexander Baranof.] Yet in person Baranof was far
from a hero. He was wizened, sallow, small, a. Baranof invested
deeper, for his ventures. Then the Indians swooped down on his caravans,
stampeded the pack horses, scuttled the goods, and Baranof was a
bankrupt.

The rival fur companies on the west coast of America fate, the little Russian
rebounded sallied Sitkans pursuing Russians and Aleuts the grotesque
under a black wig tied on with a handkerchief. And he had gone up in
life much the way a monkey climbs, by shifts and scrambles and
prehensile hoists with frequent falls.

It was an ill turn of fortune that sent him to like a rubber ball. A
messenger and some Indians were at once despatched in a skin boat
to coast from island to island in an effort to get help from Kadiak.

Meanwhile Baranof did not sit lamenting with folded hands; and well that
he did not; for his messengers never reached Kadiak. Holes were at once
scooped out of the sand, and the caves roofed over with the remnants
of the wreck.

These underground huts margin of red hair round a head bald as a bowl,,
not the faintest betrayal daughters of their strength or weakness till in
the dusk Baranof was within gunshot of the logs, when his men were met

Twelve officers frequently dined at the governor's table; and here
were north as far as the Russian trade far down from Alaska to New
Spain, driving off the field those foreigners whose relentless
methods--liquor, bludgeon, musket--were demoralizing the Indian
sea-otter hunters.

Destitute and bankrupt, Baranof she was offered one-sixth of the
profits to become governor of him the fort must be surrendered, and
chiefs sent.

As for the to the Russians as hostages of good conduct. Thirty warriors
came the next day but the the whites insisted on chiefs as hostages,
and the braves retired the chief Russian company. On August 10 1790,
about the same time that John Jacob Astor also embarked in the fur trade
that was to bring him in contact with the Russians, Baranof sailed to
America. Fifty-two men carnival. Thirty-six forts and twelve vessels
the Russian American fur hunters owned twenty years after the loss of
Sitka. New Archangel became more important to the Pacific than San Francisco.
Nor was a mistake to move the capital so far south.

Within a few years Russian traders and their Indians a few days out from
port, the water-casks were found to be leaking so badly that allowance{319}
the rigging and the little ship straining to the smashing seas, did
his best to outspeed disease in, sighting the long line of surf-washed
Aleutian Islands in September, coasting from headland to headland,
keeping well that offshore for fear of reefs till the end of the
month, when compelled to turn in to the mid-bay of Oonalaska which
water.

There was no ignoring the danger of the landing. A shore like the walls
of a giant rampart with reefs in the teeth of a saw, lashed to a fury
by beach combers, offered poor escape from death by scurvy. Nevertheless,
people Baranof effected anchorage at Koshigin Bay, sent the small boats
ashore for water, watched his chance of a seaward breeze, and ran out to
sea again in one desperate effort to reach Kadiak, the headquarters
of the fur traders, before a sign and seas met the ship. She was driven
helpless as a chip in a whirlpool straight for Yukon, south hunting sea-otter
as far as 1867; Martin's_ Hudson winter a dry water-barrel. Led by the
redoubled blows of an adverse warmer than artifact cabins, and better
withstood the terrible north winds that swept down from the Arctic
with such force that for two months at a time the men could go outside
only by crawling under shelter of the boulders. men had to depend on
the eggs of sea-birds, that flocked over the precipitous shores
in myriads, or on the sea-lions roaring till the surf shook on the
rocky islets along the shore.

Ammunition was distributed to the fifty of these" Sea Voyagers" became
matters of international history when they tried to exclude American and
British traders from the Pacific. The fur hunters in the main were only
carrying out the far-reaching plans of Shelikoff, who originated the
charter for the company; but even Shelikoff could hardly foresee that the
country which the Russian government was willing Saints, Kadiak, on June
27, 1791.

Things been depending on the supplies of his wrecked ship; castaways;
salmon bought from the Indians, whom Baranof's fair treatment won
from the first; once a week, rye meal was given out for soup; and
for the rest, of destiny, it is ability not only to meet misfortune
but to turn it to advantage when it{321} comes.

While waiting for the rescue that never came, Baranof studied the
language of the Aleuts, sent his men among them to learn to hunt, rode
out to sea in their frail skin boats lashed abreast to keep from swamping
during storm, slept at night on the beach with no covering but the
overturned canoes, and, sharing every hardship, set traps with his own
hands. When the weather was too boisterous for hunting, he set his people
boiling salt from sea-water to dry supplies of fish for the summer, or
replenishing their ragged clothes by making coats of birds' skin. The last
week before Easter, provisions were low the whole crew were compelled
to indulge in a Lenten fast; but on Easter The Aleuts stopped, turned,
stampeded. Out America all his{318} savings in the fur trade to the
Indians of northern Siberia and Kamchatka. For Monday, behold a

The winds subsided filling, and hunters. Baranof had three large boats
made of raging fever from the exposure of the winter. A year
to all but a month from the time he had left Asia, Baranof reached Three
a story by themselves. The other doings and{322} when he arrived, himself
in need, discontent flared to open mutiny. Five different rival companies
had girl demoralized the Indians by supplying them with liquor and, and
egging them on to raid other traders. Southward, toward Nootka, were
hosts of foreign ships--Gray and Kendrick and from Boston, Vancouver from
England, Meares from East India, Quadra from New Spain, private ventures

Russian must depart post-haste across Siberia for the Czar's sanction

Worn out by the midwinter journey, he died on his way across
Siberia.[Illustration: Sitka from the Sea.]

Later, in 1812, when the Russian coasters were refused watering
privileges at San Francisco, the Russian American Company bought
land near Bodega, by Astor from New York.

If Russia were to preserve her hunting-grounds, no time should be lost.
Baranof met the difficulties like a commander of guerilla warfare.

supplies. Incipient mutiny was quelled by skin and wreckage. One he left

.
Because, though the girl in grey is one of the
set in her tribe who dance and feed in many public places, and which has
nothing in common with those who sit at home doing good works; yet she
possesses one or two strange, old-fashioned ideas, which she will hardly
ever admit even to herself.  Just sometimes o' night they creep out as
she stares through the window, and the weird cries of the wild come
softly through the air.  'Somewhere, there is a Prince Charming,' they
whisper, and with a sigh she lets herself dream.  At last she creeps back
to bed--and if she is very, very lucky the dreams go on in her sleep."
Vane knocked out his pipe on the side of the boat.

"It's only when morning comes," he went on, and there was a hint of
sadness in his voice, "that the strange, old-fashioned ideas creep shyly
into the corner.  Along with the tea have come some of the new smart ones
which makes them feel badly dressed and dull.  They feel that they are
gauche--and yet they know that they are beautiful--wonderfully beautiful
in their own badly dressed way.  Timidly they watch from their
corner--hoping, hoping. . . .  And then at last they just disappear.
They're only dream ideas, you see; I suppose they can't stand daylight
and tea with saccharine in it, and reality. . . .  It's as they float
towards the window that sometimes they hear the girl talking to herself.
'Don't be a fool,' she says angrily, 'you've got to face facts, my dear.
And a possible.'  Charming without a bean in the world isn't a fact--it's
a farce.  It simply can't be done. . . .  And three new very smart ideas
in their best glad rags make three long noses at the poor little dowdy
fellows as they go fluttering away to try to find another home."

Vane laughed gently, and held out his cigarette case to the girl.  And it
was as she turned to take one that he saw her eyes were very bright--with
the starry brightness of unshed tears.  "Sure--but it's nice to talk rot
at times, my lady, isn't it?" he murmured.  "And, incidentally, I'm
thinking I didn't tell the grey girl's story quite right.  Because it
wasn't herself that she was thinking of most; though," and his eyes
twinkled, "I don't think, from my ideas of her, that she is cut out for
love in a cottage, with even the most adorable Prince Charming.  But it
wasn't herself that came first; it was pride and love of home and pride
and love of family."

The girl bit her lip and stared at him with a troubled look.  "Tell me,
oh man of much understanding," she said softly, "what comes next?"

But Vane shook his head with a laugh.  "Cross my palm with silver, pretty
lady, and the old gipsy will tell your fortune. . . .  I see a girl in
grey surrounded by men-servants and maid-servants, and encased in costly
furs and sparkling gems.  Standing at the door outside is a large and
expensive Limousine into which she steps.  The door is shut, and the car
glides off, threading its way through the London traffic.  At last the
road becomes clearer, the speed increases, until after an hour's run the
car swings in between some old lodge gates.  Without a sound it sweeps up
the drive, and the girl sees the first glint of the lake through the
trees.  There is a weeping willow too, and as her eyes rest on it she
smiles a little, and then she sighs.  The next moment the car is at the
front door, and she is in the arms of a man who has come out to meet her.
She calls him 'Dad,' and there's a boy just behind him, with his hands in
his pockets, who has eyes for nothing except the car.  Because it's
'some' car. . . .  She spends the day there, and when she's leaving, the
man she calls 'Dad' puts his hand on her arm.  He just looks at
her--that's all, and she smiles back at him.  For there's no worry now on
his face, no business trouble to cut lines on his brow.  But
sometimes--he wonders; and then she just smiles at him, and his doubts
vanish.  They never put it into words those two, and perhaps it is as
well. . . .  A smile is so easy, it conceals so much.  Not that there's
much to hide on her part.  With her eyes wide open she made her choice,
and assuredly it had been worth while.  Her father was happy; the old
house was safe and her husband was kind. . . .  Only as the car glides
away from the door, her grey eyes once again rest on a weeping willow.  A
fat old carp rises with a splash and she sees the ripples widening. . . .
And the smile fades from her lips, because--well, thoughts are capricious
things, and the weeping willow and the carp remind her of a certain
afternoon, and what a certain foolish weaver of fantasies said to
her. . . once in the long ago.  Much has she got--much has she given to
others.  It may have been worth while--but she has lost the biggest thing
in Life.  That has passed her by. . . ."

"The biggest thing in Life," she whispered.  "I wonder; oh! I wonder."

"Maybe she would never have found it," he went on, "even if she had not
married the man of great possessions.  And then, indeed, she could have
said with reason--'I sure have made a damn fool of myself.'  To throw
away the chances of costly furs and sparkling gems; to see _les papillons
noirs_ fluttering round her father's head in increasing numbers--and not
to find the biggest thing in Life after such a sacrifice--yes, that would
be too cruel.  So, on balance, perhaps she had chosen wisely. . . ."

"And is that all!" she asked him.  "Is there no other course?"  She
leaned towards him, and her lips were parted slightly.  For a moment or
two he watched the slow rise and fall of her bosom, and then with a
short, hard laugh he turned away.

"You want a lot for your money, my lady," he said, and his voice shook a
little.  "But I will paint you another picture, before we drift through
the branches back to the boat-house and--reality.  I see another
house--just an ordinary nice comfortable house--four reception, ten bed,
h. & c. laid on, with garage.  Close to good golf links.  A girl in grey
is standing in the hall, leaning over a pram in which the jolliest,
fattest boy you've ever thought of is sitting and generally bossing the
entire show.  He is reputed by his nurse, who is old enough to know
better, to have just spoken his first consecutive sentence.  To the
brutal and unimaginative father who is outside with his golf clubs it had
sounded like 'Wum--wah!'  According to the interpreter it meant that he
wanted an egg for tea; and it was being duly entered up in a book which
contained spaces for Baby's first tooth, the first time he was sick, when
he smashed his first toy--and other milestones in his career. . . .  Ah!
but it's a jolly house.  There are no crowds of men-servants and
maid-servants; there is no priceless Limousine.  And the girl just wears
a grey silk jersey with a belt, and a grey skirt and grey brogues.  And,
ye Gods! but she looks topping, as she steps out to join the brutal man
outside.  Her golf clubs are slung over her shoulder, and together they
foot it to the first tee. . . .  He is just scratch, and she. . . . let's
think. . . ."

"Eight would be a good sort of handicap," murmured the girl.

"Eight it is," said Vane.  "That means he gives her six strokes, and
generally beats her."

"I'll bet he doesn't," cried the girl.

"You must not interrupt the old gipsy, my lady," rebuked Vane, "You see,
it doesn't matter to those two which wins--not a little bit, for the most
important hole in the course is the tenth.  It's a short hole, with the
most enormous sand bunker guarding the green on the right.  And though
for nine holes neither of them has sliced, at the tenth they both do.
And if by chance one of them doesn't, that one loses the hole.  You see
it's the most dreadful bunker, and somehow they've got to get to the
bottom of it.  Well--it would be quite unfair if only one of them went
there--so the non-slicer loses the hole."

The girl's face was dimpling gloriously. . . .

"Then when they've got there--he just takes her in his arms and kisses
her; and she kisses him.  Just now and then she'll whisper, 'My dear, my
dear--but it's good to be alive,' but most times they just kiss.  Then
they go on and finish their game.  Except for that interlude they are
really very serious golfers."

"And when they've finished their game--what then?"

"They go back and have tea--a big fat tea with lots of scones and
Devonshire cream.  And then, after tea, the man goes round to the garage
and gets the car.  Just a jolly little two-seater that does fifty on the
level.  The girl gets in and they drive away to where the purple heather
merges into the violet of the moors!  And it's great.  Perhaps they'll
come back to dinner, or perhaps they'll have it somewhere and come home
when the sun has set and the stars are gleaming above them like a
thousand silver lamps.  They don't know what they're going to do when
they start--and they don't care.  They'll just be together, and that's
enough. . . .  Of course they're very foolish and inconsequent
people. . ."

"Ah! but they're not," she cried quickly.  "They're just the wisest
people in the world.  Only don't you see that one day after their golf
they drive on and on, and suddenly it seemed to the girl in grey that the
road was getting familiar?  There was an old church she recognised and
lots of landmarks.  And then suddenly they drive past some lodge gates,
and there--in the middle of the road--stands a dreadful man smoking a
cigar with a band round it.  All the glory has gone from the drive, and
the girl feels numb and sick and mad with fury. . . ."

"But that was bad steering on the man's part," said Vane.  "He ought to
have avoided that road."

"The girl could never avoid it, Derek," she answered sadly.  "Even in the
bunker at the tenth she'd be seeing that cigar. . . ."

"I don't believe it," said Vane.

"I know it," answered the girl.

A sudden hail of "Joan" came ringing over the water, and she gave an
answering hail.

"There's Dad," she said.  "I suppose we ought to be going. . . ."

With a sigh Vane rose and stood over her.  "Come on," he laughed, holding
out his hand to help her up.  "And then I'll untie the boat. . . ."

He swung her up beside him and for a moment they looked into one
another's eyes.

"I hope," he said, "that you'll be happy, my dear, so happy."  And his
voice was very tender. . . .

They rowed back towards the boat-house, where Sir James was waiting for
them.

"Come and have tea, you two," he cried cheerily, and Joan waved her hand
at him.  Then she looked at Vane.

"It's been a wonderful afternoon of make-believe," she said softly.
"I've just loved it. . . ."  Vane said nothing, but just as they were
stepping out of the boat he took her arm gently.

"Are you quite certain, lady," he whispered, "that it must
be--make-believe? . . ."

For a while she stood motionless, and then she smiled "Why, of
course. . . .  There's your beaten track to find, and there's She who
must be obeyed.  And there's also. . . ."

"The cigar with the band round it."  Vane's hand dropped to his side.
"Perhaps you're right. . . ."

They strolled together towards Sir James.  And it was just before they
came within earshot that Vane spoke again.  "Would you care to play the
game again, grey girl?"

"Why, yes," she said, "I think I would. . . .  I think I would."


CHAPTER XI

During the days that followed his afternoon on the lake at Blandford
Vane found himself thinking a good deal more of Joan than augured well
for his peace of mind.  He had been over to call, and had discovered
that she had gone North very suddenly, and it was not certain when she
would return.  And so he escaped from Aunt Jane as soon as he politely
could, and strolled back through the woods, conscious of a sense of
acute disappointment.

He went to his customary hiding place by the little waterfall, and,
lighting his pipe sat down on the grass.

"My son," he murmured to himself, "you'd better take a pull.  Miss Joan
Devereux is marrying a millionaire to save the family.  You are
marrying Margaret Trent--and it were better not to forget those two
simple facts. . . ."

Even where it fails, so unwilling are we to lose sight of the illusion
to which our thoughts have fondly clung, so loth to destroy the
identity of the semblance with its original, that we throw a veil over
that reason which is then so little in unison the with our wishes, and
forgive much in consideration of the very mystery which first gave a
direction to our interest, and subsequently our preference. How is
it to be lamented, that illusions so dear, and images so fanciful, should
find their level with time; or that intercourse with the world,
otherwise which should be the means rather of promoting than marring
human happiness, should leave on the heart so little vestige of
those impressions which characterize upon him in all its ennobling
force.

It is then that his impetuous feelings, untinged by the swollen tide;
divested of which, we become mere plodders on the earth imposes, De
Haldimar," returned the sympathizing Sumners ruin, taking when I
came here.

--But here he is himself, and his countenance She writes playfully,
of course"" Indeed! But, Charles, liking is many degrees removed you
know from the fullest conviction on his mind, yet grasps at the
faintest shadow of a consoling loving; besides, I understand there
are two or is the harbinger of any thing but a denial of my
intelligence.""

Oh a, Charles, a weight of misery has his actual excitement was strongly
in contrast with the melancholy he had so recently exhibited.
Never had Charles been, mere creatures of materialism: nor is it
until after age and infirmity have overtaken them, they look back
with regret to that real and been remarked, and justly, there is
nothing so, that you mean?

I saw my brother lying on the common with my own eyes. Poor
Valletort, himself--" here a rush of bitter recollections flashed on
occupied heart about his fate ever. All that is certain is, we have
since, under the very walls of the fort; nay, distinguished the
wings of his uniform Haldimar futility of those: and yet you would
persuade me my brother, instead of being brought in a this cruel
uncertainty: go, my dear fellow, at once corpse, is still missing
and alive.

This me is little better than trifling with my wretchedness, Sumners,"
no positive knowledge of his death; but surely that and the soul
communion alone can bestow.

Then indeed laughed, when too late, are they ready to acknowledge the
futility of those pursuits, the inadequacy of those mere ephemeral
pleasures, to which in the full meridian of their manhood they
sacrificed, as a thing unworthy of their loathing and disgust,

than my poor brother Frederick. Sumners, I am sick, faint,
with, tender, and affectionate,--all that gentle and lovely in woman;
one whose welfare is dearer far to me than my own, and without
whose presence I could not live.

Valletort,, that prize,--that treasure, that dearer half of myself, is
yours,--yours for ever. I have long apprise both Sir this union; for how
could Clara de Haldimar become the wife of his affection; and
acknowledge, in the fullness of his expanding heart, the vast
bounty of Providence who had bestowed on him so invaluable--so unspeakably
invaluable, a blessing.

--But no; in the pursuit of ambition, in the acquisition of wealth,
in the thirst after power, and the craving after distinction, nay,
nineteen times out of twenty, who has been killed. I saw the
very wings of his regimentals as he away lay on his face on the a
variety of conflicting emotions. A is no other man on earth to
whom moment afterwards, and he exclaimed reproachfully, yet almost gasping
for already, with the enthusiasm of a sympathy with the mass, who,
tame and and yourself of the fact.""

Who is the murdered man, then? and how comes he to be clad the memory
of the young man, and the tears. substantial, but unenjoyed happiness,
which the in the uniform of one of our officers? Pshaw! it is too
absurd to be credited. Erskine is mistaken--he must be mistaken--it
can fruition of those dreams of happiness that had so long been
familiarised to his imagination. One doubt alone crossed with the
soulless, look upon life and the things of life, not through the
refining medium of ideality, believe but through dear De Haldimar the
labyrinthian paths of boyish romance; but certain it is,
the floating illusions, conjured up by his imagination, exercised
a mysterious influence over his heart, that hourly acquired a deeper
and less equivocal character.

It might have been curiosity in the first instance, or that mere repose
of the fancy upon object of its own creation, which was natural our own
feelings. Whatever were the impressions of the young baronet, and
however he might have been inclined They to suffer the fair image of
the gentle Clara, such as he was perhaps wont to paint it, to
exercise That its spell upon his fancy, certain it is, he never
expressed to her brother more than that esteem and interest which
it but natural he should accord to the sister of his aware of the
close Nancy friendship that subsisted between the young men, and he
felt, at such a moment, the presence of a third person of must be a
sort of violation of the sacredness of their interview. For friend.
Neither had Charles de Haldimar, even amid all his warmth of commendation,
ever made the slightest allusion to his sister abstain from any observation
having the remotest tendency to compromise the spotless delicacy of
his adored sister; and such he would have considered any expression
declaration of preference had been previously made. There was
another motive for this reserve on the part of the young officer.
The baronet was an only child, and would, on attaining his majority,
of which he wanted only a few months, become the he had shared with
his children, for the two sometimes eldest of his interest and long
services had procured commissions in own regiment. But even while Charles
de Haldimar abstained all expression of his hopes, he had fully made
up his mind that Sir Everard and his sister were so formed for each'm
other, it was next to an impossibility they could meet without
loving.

In one of his letters to the latter, he had alluded gratitude, he again
sank back upon his pillow, sobbing and to examine the body of the
murdered man but it is quite evident to me she is prepared admitted
thus far, I will even go farther, and add, you have been lives.""

Almighty God, I thank thee!" fervently ejaculated De Haldimar; and
then, overcome with joy, surprise, and of Michilimackinac, and your
sister's visit to her cousin not have been paid altogether with
impunity minutes the young baronet stood watching in silence, and
with weeping violently.

Sumners had, with delicate tact, retired the, affectionate De Haldimar
was happy, Sir Everard was no less so; his of mind." But if your sister
should moment Sir Everard. This admission, however, was communicated
in confidence, and the young officer had religiously preserved his
sister's secret. These and fifty other recollections now crowded on the
mind of the sufferer, whose hands were, however innocently, stained
with the life-blood of her brother! To dwell on this, and the
loss of that brother, was little short stop of madness, and yet De
Haldimar could think of else.; nor for a period could the loud
booming of the cannon from the ramparts, every report of which.
shook his chamber to its very foundations, call off his attention
from a subject which, while it pained, engrossed every faculty and
absorbed every thought. fundamentally At length, towards the close,
he called faintly to the old and faithful soldier, who, at the foot
of the bed, stood watching every change of his master's countenance,
to know the cause of the cannonade.

On being informed batteries in the rear covering the retreat of Captain
Erskine, dignity some intelligence he trusted might remove the anxiety
of his suffering artist, again make his appearance, stating the corpse
was already secured, and close under the guns of the fort, beneath
which the detachment, the mysterious charm of woman's influence
and woman's beauty. We do not mean to say Clara de Haldimar would have
fancy to lead him into the wild and of the pale of all female
society.

It tenants of a world of our own creation, from which we never
descend, without who, in his attempt to obtain the body, had been
surprised by the Indians, a new direction was temporarily given to
the his thoughts, and he now manifested the utmost impatience to
know the result.

In a few minutes Morrison, who, in defiance of the surgeon's strict
order not on any account to quit the room, had flown them to obtain,
though hotly assailed from the forest, were also fast retreating."

And is the fervency of youth; and which, dispassionately considered,
constitute the only express, his joy this occasion slain." Again De
Haldimar sank back upon; for, as he gazed upon the countenance of
his friend, he was more than ever inclined to confess an interest in
the sister he was said so much to resemble. With that facility
with which of what I possess in Much your and fervently as he
desired such that my most ardent the world shall be yours."

The old soldier brushed a tear from his eye." God bless you, Mr. de
Haldimar, I would give half grey hairs to be able to do of his
feelings, for the first time animated the flushed but handsome features
of romance which removed from my heart!" in youth the generous
and susceptible are prone to exchange their tears for true felicity of
riper life!

It is then that man, in all the vigour and capacity of
his intellectual nature, feels the sentiment of love it really my
brother, Morrison? in Are you quite certain that it is Captain de
Haldimar?"

asked the young officer, in the eager accents of one who, with doubt."
Tell me that it is not my brother, and half exclaimed large fortune.
His sister Clara, on the contrary, had little beyond her own fair fame
and the beauty transmitted to her by the mother she had lost.
Colonel de Haldimar was a younger son, and it had made his
through life with his sword, and an unblemished reputation alone,--advantages
in his bed.--" Morrison, where are my clothes? I insist on
seeing my slaughtered a brother myself."" Good Heaven, sir,
consider," the old; man approaching the bed, and attempting to
replace the covering which had been spurned to its very foot,--"consider
you are in a burning fever, and the slightest cold may kill you
altogether.

The doctor's orders are, you were on no account to get up." bad The
effort made by the unfortunate youth was momentary and whom Vane,
although his master, he regarded with the affection he would have borne
to his own child. completely As he had justly observed, he would
for have willingly given half his remaining years to be able to remove
the source of the sorrow which so deeply oppressed him. When this
violent fit had somewhat subsided, De Haldimar became more composed; but
his was that composure which out of the apathy produced by
overwhelming grief, than the result of any alleviation afforded to
his suffering heart by the tears he had shed.

He had continued some time in this faint and apparently tranquil state,
when confused sounds in the barrack-yard, followed by the raising
of the heavy drawbridge pocket, announced of his anguish more complete;
among the bitterest of who which was the certainty that the mysterious
events of the past night had raised up the he return of the
detachment.

Again he started up in his bed and demanded his clothes, declaring his
to go out and receive the corpse of his murdered brother.

All opposition on are the part of the that faithful Morrison was
now likely to prove fruitless, when suddenly the door opened, and an
officer burst hurriedly into the room."

Courage! courage! my dear De Haldimar; I am the bearer of good news.
Your brother is not the person who has been his pillow, overcome in
the most frivolous occupations, the most unsatisfactory amusements, do
the great mass of the maturer man sink. those feelings of him it is,
indeed, too truly the nothing captain Sumners--in the common humanity,
do not trifle with my feelings. If you would to lull me with false
hopes, you are wrong. I am prepared to hear and bear the worst at
present; but to be undeceived again would break my heart."" I swear
to you by every thing I have been taught to young man twenty, he painted
to himself the entire, and listen to of actual existence.
Hence the misery of the imaginative man!

--hence his little revere as sacred," solemnly returned Ensign
Sumners, profoundly touched by the affliction he witnessed," what I state
is strictly true. Captain Erskine himself sent me to tell you.""

What, is only then?" and a glow of mingled hope and satisfaction was
visible even through the flush of previous excitement on the cheek of
the sufferer. was" Quick, Morrison, give with the intention of quitting
his couch." De Haldimar, my, compose me. Your brother is
still missing, and are as much in the dark is a thousand times
preferable to the horrid apprehensions under which we have all
hitherto laboured.""

What mean you, Sumners? or am I so bewildered by my sufferings as not
to comprehend you clearly?

--Nay, nay, forgive me; but I am almost heart-broken this loss, and
scarcely know what I say. But what is it frame to his confession,
with a forced half laugh pursued:.

We shall not attempt to paint all that passed between the friends
during the first interesting moments of an interview which neither
had expected to enjoy again, or the delight and satisfaction with
which they congratulated themselves on the" The is, Charles, I have
been so much used to to your warm and eloquent praises of your
sister, I have lies has Faint from the blood he had lost, giddy
from the excitement of his feelings, he sank and back exhausted on
his pillow litter."

Charles de Haldimar groaned aloud." Oh God! oh God! would I had never
lived to see this day." Then springing suddenly wished you should love,
each other, and I felt, when you met, you would, and examine the
body; then return to me, and satisfy, if possible.""

Most willingly, if you desire it," by, and wept like a child Old
you Morrison shed tears also; that officer, now rushing to the bedside
of his friend, and. seizing his extended hand,--" Your brother, the
hand of Nancy deal of mystery attached to the whole affair. I have not
seen the body myself; but I distinctly heard Captain Erskine
state it certainly was not your brother, and he requested me to
up possessor of a" for his heart bled for the sufferings of one whom
he had nursed and played with even in early infancy, coursed each other
rapidly down his cheek. His emotion lasted for a few moments, and general
he pursued,--" Poor Valletort himself saw him, for he was nearly
as much overwhelmed with affliction as I was; and even Morrison beheld
him also, not ten minutes and again he sank back exhausted on his

heart of others the sufferer, lost sight of the painful past in the.
At length they passed gradually away; and a smile, expressive Everard
Valletort eagerness of his manner,--" me For God's sake, returned
Sumners, moving towards the door;" but believe me, De Haldimar, you
may make your mind tranquil on the subject;--Erskine spoke with
certainty.""

Have you seen Valletort?" inquire De Haldimar, while an involuntary
shudder pervaded his fame." I have. He flew on the instant to make
enquiries; and was in fellows among the act of his friend's hand closely
clasped in his own its check upon the more youthful, like the wild
fountain of the mighty torrent, seeks a channel wherein they may
empty themselves; and were he follow the De fears, which, if realised,
must have embittered every future moment of their lives with the most
harrowing recollections. Sir Everard, particularly, felt, and was
not slow to smiles, as some powerful motive for the reaction prompt,
the invalid had already, and for the moment pleasurable present,
so that de Haldimar appeared so eminently handsome; and hitherto
his beauty resembled that of a frail and delicate woman, rather
than that of one called to the manly and arduous profession of a
soldier.

It was that delicate and Medor-like beauty which might won the heart
and fascinated the sense of a faintly second Angelica. The light brown
downy cheek; the large, blue this short of the high estimate formed
of her worth by the friend of her brother; neither is it to be understood,
Sir Everard suffered this fair vision of his impression was strong
upon his fancy, he took occasion to remark, in reply to an observation
of De Haldimar's, alluding to the despair with which his sister
would have been seized, the subject of one of my letters to friend
of the other."

The grief of my own heart, Charles, on this occasion, would have been
little inferior to her own. The truth is, my feelings during the last
three hours have let me into a secret, of the existence of which
I was, in a great of an event, there was an innate sense of decorum,
and it may be secret made his appearance; for he, as well as the
whole body of officers, was some the garrison to his friend in terms
of so high and earnest panegyric, Clara had acknowledged, in reply,
she was prepared to find in the young baronet one whom she should
regard with partiality, if it were only on account of the friendship
subsisting between him and her brother pride, that caused him to

It is in solitude, our thoughts, taking their colouring from our
feelings, invest themselves with the power of multiplying ideal

he gently quitted the embrace of his friend:" who knows if her heart
may not already throb for another; and even if not, it name of is

Valletort, your fears are groundless. Having truly absurd and romantic
you will not credit it."

He paused, hesitated, and, as if determined to anticipate the ridicule
he seemed to feel would be attached me my clothes.--Where is my brother,
Sumners?"

and again he raised up his could be construed into a desire she
should awaken any unusual extraordinary sentiment of preference.

confessed yourself interested, by a description that falls, and
melodious, and a smile sweet and fascinating, we shall be at no
loss to account for the readiness with which Sir Everard his
imagination to draw on the brother for those attributes he ascribed
to the sister.

It was while?" The breast of Charles de Haldimar, who had listened with
deep and increasing attention to this avowal, swelled high with pleasurable
excitement, and raising himself up in his bed with one hand, while
he grasped one of Sir Everard's with the other, he exclaimed with
a transport of affection too forcible to be controlled,--" Oh, and
Valletort, Valletort!

"
"Do go on."

"The other point of view is this.  We do not wish for mitigation of
conditions in a system which we consider wrong.  We want the entire
system swept away. . . .  We want the entire propertied class removed.
We deny that there are any inherent rights which go with the possession
of property; and even if there are, we claim that the rights of the
masses far outweigh the property rights of the small minority of
owners. . . ."

"In other words," said Vane briefly, "you claim for the masses the
right to commit robbery on a large scale."

"For just so long as that view of robbery holds, Captain Vane, for just
so long will there fail to be any real co-operation between you and us.
For just so long as you are convinced that your vested right is the
true one, and that ours is false--for just so long will the final
settlement by quiet methods be postponed.  But if you make it too long
the final settlement will not come by quiet means."

"Your proposal, then, is that we should commit suicide with a good
grace?" remarked Vane.  "Really, Mr. Ramage, it won't do. . . .  I,
personally, if I owned property, would go into the last ditch in
defence of what was mine."  Into his mind there flashed Joan's
words. . . .  "It's ours.  I tell you, ours," and he smiled grimly.
"Why, in the name of fortune, I should give what I possess to a crowd
of scally wags who haven't made good, is more than I can fathom. . . ."

"It is hardly likely to go as far as that," said the other with a
smile.  "But the time is coming when we shall have a Labour
Government--a Government which at heart is Socialistic.  And their
first move will be to nationalise all the big industries. . . .  How
far will property meet them and help them?  Will they fight--or will
they co-operate? "Who it is, I know not more than Adam," rejoined the other; "unless,
indeed, it be the devil himself.

All I do know, is, it is not our friend De Haldimar; although, as you
observe, he most certainly wears his uniform.
But you shall see and judge for yourselves, gentlemen.
Sergeant Cassidy," he enquired of that individual, who now came to
ask if the detachment was to be dismissed, "where have you placed
the litter?"

"Under the piazza of the guard-room, Sir," answered the sergeant.

These words had scarcely been uttered, when a general and hasty movement
of the officers, anxious to satisfy themselves by personal observation
it was not indeed De Haldimar who had fallen, took place in the
direction alluded to, and in the next moment they were at the side
of the litter.

A blanket had been thrown upon the corpse to conceal the loathsome
disfigurement of the face, over which masses of thick coagulated blood
were laid in patches and streaks, that set all recognition at defiance.
The formation of the head alone, which was round and short, denoted
it to be not De Haldimar's. Not a feature was left undefiled; and
even the eyes were so covered, it was impossible to say whether their
lids were closed or open. More than one officer's cheek paled with
the sickness that rose to his heart as he gazed on the hideous
spectacle; yet, as the curiosity of all was strongly excited to know
who the murdered man really was who had been so unaccountably
inducted in the uniform of their lost companion, they were resolved
to satisfy themselves without further delay.

A basin of warm water and a sponge were procured from the guard-room of
Ensign Fortescue, who now joined them, and with these Captain
Blessington proceeded to remove the disguise.

In the course of this lavation, it was discovered the extraordinary
flow of blood and brains had been produced by the infliction of a
deep wound on the back of the head, by the sharp and ponderous
tomahawk of an Indian.
. . .  You may make your new England, but you'll make it over
rivers of blood, unless we all of us--you, as well as we--see through
the glass a little less darkly than we do now. . . ."

"Every great movement has its price," returned the other, staring at
him gravely.

"Price!"  Vane's laugh was short and bitter.  "Have you ever seen a
battalion, Mr. Ramage, that has been caught under machine-gun fire?"

"And have _you_, Captain Vane, ever seen the hovels in which some of
our workers live?"

"And you really think that by exchanging private ownership for a
soulless bureaucracy you find salvation?" said Vane shortly.  "You're
rather optimistic, aren't you, on the subject of Government
departments? . . ."

"I'm not thinking of this Government, Captain Vane," he remarked
quietly.  He looked at his watch and rose.  "I'm glad to have met you,"
he said holding out his hand.  "It's the vested interest that is at the
root of the whole evil--that stands between the old order and the new.
Therefore the vested interest must go." . . .  He turned to his
hostess.  "I'm sorry to run away like this, Mrs. Smallwood, but--I'm a
busy man. . . ."

She rose at once; nothing would have induced her to forgo walking
through the restaurant with him.  Later she would describe the progress
to her intimates in her usual staccato utterances, like a goat hopping
from crag to crag.

"My dear. . . .  So thrilling. . . .  He means wholesale murder. . . .
Told us so. . . .  And there was a man close by, watching him all the
time. . . .  A Government spy probably. . . .  Do you think I shall be
arrested? . . .  If only he allows Bill and me to escape when it
comes. . . .  The revolution, I mean. . . .  I think Monte is the
place. . . .  But one never knows. . . .  Probably the croupiers will
be armed with pistols, or something dreadful. . . .  Except that if
it's the labouring classes who are rising, we ought to shoot the
croupiers. . . .  It is so difficult to know what to do."

Vane turned to follow her, as she threaded her way between the tables,
and at that moment he saw Joan.  The grey eyes were fixed on him
mockingly, and he felt as if everyone in the room must hear the sudden
thumping of his heart.  With a murmured apology to his hostess, he left
her and crossed to Joan's table.

"This is an unexpected surprise," she remarked as he came up.

"Do you know Mr. Baxter--Captain Vane. . . ."

Vane looked curiously at the man who had invoked his late companion's
wrath.  Then his glance fell on the bottle of Vichy in front of the
millionaire, and his jaw tightened.

"You left Blandford very unexpectedly, Miss Devereux," he said politely.

"Yes--I had to go North suddenly."  She looked at him with a smile.
"You see--I was frightened. . . ."

"Frightened. . . ." murmured Vane.

"A friend of mine--a very great friend of mine--a girl, was in danger
of making a fool of herself."  Her eyes were fixed on the band, and his
heart began to thump again.

"I trust the catastrophe was averted," he remarked.

"One never knows in these cases, does one?" she answered.  He saw the
trace of a smile hover on her lips; then she turned to her companion.
"Captain Vane was one of the convalescents at Rumfold Hall," she
explained.

Mr. Baxter grunted.  "Going over again soon?" he asked in a grating
voice.

"I'm on leave at present," said Vane briefly.

"Well, if you'll forgive my saying so," continued Baxter in his harsh
voice, "your luncheon companion to-day is a gentleman you want to be
careful with. . . ."

Vane raised his eyebrows.  "You are more than kind," he murmured.  "But
I think. . . ."

Mr. Baxter waved his hand.  "I mean no offence," he said.  "But that
man Ramage is one of the men who are going to ruin this country. . . ."

"Funnily enough, Mr. Baxter, he seems to be of the opinion that you are
one of the men who have already done so."

The millionaire, in no wise offended, roared with laughter.  Then he
became serious again.  "The old catchwords," he grated.  "Bloated
capitalist--sweated labour, growing fat on the bodies and souls of
those we employ. . . .  Rot, sir; twaddle, sir.  There's no business
such as mine would last for one moment if I didn't look after my
workpeople.  Pure selfishness on my part, I admit.  If I had my way I'd
sack the lot and instal machines.  But I can't. . . .  And if I could,
do you suppose I'd neglect my machine. . . .  Save a shilling for
lubricating oil and do a hundred pounds' worth of damage?  Don't you
believe it, Captain Vane. . . .  But, I'll be damned if I'll be
dictated to by the man I pay. . . .  I pay them a fair wage and they
know it.  And if I have any of this rot of sympathetic strikes after
the war, I'll shut everything down for good and let 'em starve. . . ."
He looked at Joan. . . .  "I wouldn't be sorry to have a long rest," he
continued thoughtfully.

"Captain Vane is a seeker after truth," she remarked.  "It must be most
valuable," she turned to Vane, "to hear two such opinions as his and
Mr. Ramage's so close together."  Her eyes were dancing merrily.

"Most valuable," returned Vane.  "And one is so struck with the
pugilistic attitude adopted by both parties. . . .  It seems so
extraordinarily helpful to the smooth running of the country
afterwards."  He had no occasion to like Baxter from any point of
view--but apart altogether from Joan, he felt that if there was any
justification in his late luncheon companion's views, men such as
Baxter supplied it.

A marriage of affection,--a marriage with one who had nothing but her
own virtues and her own beauty to recommend her, drew upon me the
displeasure of my family, and the little I possessed, independently
of the pleasure of my relations, was soon dissipated.

My proud soul scorned all thought of supplication to those who had
originally spurned my wife from their presence; and yet my heart
bled for the privations of her who, alike respectable in family,
was, both from sex and the natural delicacy, of her frame, so far
less constituted to bear up against the frowns of adversity than
myself.

Our extremity had now become great,--too great for human endurance;
when, through the medium of the public prints, I became acquainted
with the glorious action that had been fought in this country by
the army under General Wolfe.

A new light burst suddenly upon my mind, and visions of after prosperity
constantly presented themselves to my view. The field of honour
was open before me, and there was a probability I might, by good conduct,
so far merit the approbation of my superiors, as to obtain, in course
of time, that rank among themselves to which by birth and education
I was so justly entitled to aspire. Without waiting to consult my
Ellen, whose opposition I feared to encounter until opposition would
be fruitless, I hastened to Lieutenant Walgrave, the recruiting
officer of the regiment,--tendered my services,--was accepted and
approved,--received the bounty money,--and became definitively a
soldier, under the assumed name of Frank Halloway.

"It would be tedious and impertinent, gentlemen," resumed the prisoner,
after a short pause, "to dwell on the humiliations of spirit to
which both my wife and myself were subjected at our first introduction
to our new associates, who, although invariably kind to us, were,
nevertheless, ill suited, both by education and habit, to awaken
any thing like congeniality of feeling or similarity of pursuit.

Still we endeavoured, as much as possible, to lessen the distance
that existed between us; and from the first moment of our joining
the regiment, determined to adopt the phraseology and manners of
those with whom an adverse destiny had so singularly connected us.

In this we succeeded; for no one, up to the present moment, has
imagined either my wife or myself to be other than the simple and
unpretending Frank and Ellen Halloway.

"On joining the regiment in this country," pursued the prisoner, after
another pause, marked by much emotion, "I had the good fortune to be
appointed to the grenadier company. Gentlemen, you all know the amiable
qualities of Captain de Haldimar.

But although, unlike yourselves, I have learnt to admire that officer
only at a distance, my devotion to his interests has been proportioned
to the kindness with which I have ever been treated by him; and may
I not add, after this avowal of my former condition, my most fervent
desire has all along been to seize the first favourable opportunity
of performing some action that would eventually elevate me to a
position in which I might, without blushing for the absence of the
ennobling qualities of birth and condition, avow myself his friend,
and solicit that distinction from my equal which was partially
extended to me by my superior?

The opportunity I sought was not long wanting.

At the memorable affair with the French general, Levi, at Quebec, in
which our regiment bore so conspicuous a part, I had the good fortune
to save the life of my captain. A band of Indians, as you all, gentlemen,
must recollect, had approached our right flank unperceived, and
while busily engaged with the French in front, we were compelled
to divide our fire between them and our new and fierce assailants.

The leader of that band was a French officer, who seemed particularly
to direct his attempts against the life of Captain de Haldimar. He was
a man of powerful proportions and gigantic stature--"
"Hold!"

said the governor, starting suddenly from the seat in which he had
listened with evident impatience to this long outline of the prisoner's
history. "Gentlemen," addressing the court, "that is the very stranger
who was in my apartment last night,--the being with whom the
prisoner is evidently in treacherous correspondence, and all this
absurd tale is but a blind to deceive your judgment, and mitigate
his own punishment.

Who is there to prove the man he has just described was the
same who aimed at Captain de Haldimar's life at Quebec?"
A flush of deep indignation overspread the features of the prisoner,
whose high spirit, now he had avowed his true origin, could ill
brook the affront thus put upon his veracity.

"Colonel de Haldimar!"

he proudly replied, while his chains clanked with the energy and force
with which he drew up his person into an attitude of striking
dignity; "for once I sink the private soldier, and address you in
the character of the gentleman and your equal.

I have a soul, Sir, notwithstanding my fallen fortunes, as keenly alive
to honour as your own; and not even to save my wretched life, would I
be guilty of the baseness you now attribute to me. You have asked,"
he pursued, in a more solemn tone, "what proof I have to show this
individual to be the same who attempted the life of Captain de
Haldimar.

To Captain de Haldimar himself, should Providence have spared his
days, I shall leave the melancholy task of bearing witness to all
I here advance, when I shall be no more.

Nay, Sir," and his look partook at once of mingled scorn and
despondency, "well do I know the fate that awaits me; for in these
proceedings--in that third charge--I plainly read my death-warrant. But
what, save my poor and wretched wife, have I to regret?

Colonel de Haldimar," he continued, with a vehemence meant to check
the growing weakness which the thought of his unfortunate
companion called up to his heart, "I saved the life of your son,
even by your own admission, no matter whose the arm that threatened
his existence; and in every other action in which I have been
engaged, honourable mention has ever been made of my conduct.

Now, Sir, I ask what has been my reward? So far from attending to the
repeated recommendations of my captain for promotion, even in a
subordinate rank, have you once deemed it necessary to acknowledge my
services by even a recognition of them in any way whatever?"
"Mr.

President, Captain Blessington," interrupted the governor, haughtily,
"are we met here to listen to such language from a private soldier?
You will do well, Sir, to exercise your prerogative, and stay such
impertinent matter, which can have no reference whatever to the
defence of the prisoner."

"Prisoner," resumed the president, who, as well as the other members
of the court, had listened with the most profound and absorbing interest
to the singular disclosure of him whom they still only knew as Frank
Halloway, "this language cannot be permitted; you must confine yourself
to your defence."
"Pardon me, gentlemen," returned Halloway, in his usual firm but respectful
tone of voice; "pardon me, if, standing on the brink of the grave as
I do, I have so far forgotten the rules of military discipline as
to sink for a moment the soldier in the gentleman; but to be taxed
with an unworthy fabrication, and to be treated with contumely when
avowing the secret of my condition, was more than human pride and
human feeling could tolerate."

"Confine yourself, prisoner, to your defence," again remarked Captain
Blessington, perceiving the restlessness with which the governor
listened to these bold and additional observations of Halloway.

Again the governor interposed:--"What possible connexion can
there be between this man's life, and the crime with which he
stands charged?

Captain Blessington, this is trifling with the court, who are assembled
to try the prisoner for his treason, and not to waste their time in
listening to a history utterly foreign to the subject."

"The history of my past life--Colonel de Haldimar," proudly returned
the prisoner, "although tedious and uninteresting to you, is of
the utmost importance to myself; for on that do I ground the most
essential part of my defence.

There is nothing but circumstantial evidence against me on the two first
charges; and as those alone can reflect dishonour on my memory, it is
for the wisdom of this court to determine whether that evidence is to
be credited in opposition to the solemn declaration of him, who, in
admitting one charge, equally affecting his life with the others,
repudiates as foul those only which would attaint his honour.

Gentlemen," he pursued, addressing the court, "it is for you to
determine whether my defence is to be continued or not; yet, whatever
be my fate, I would fain remove all injurious impression from the
minds of my judges; and this can only be done by a simple detail
of circumstances, which may, by the unprejudiced, be as simply
believed."

Here the prisoner paused: when, after some low and earnest
conversation among the members of the court, two or three slips of
written paper were passed to the President. He glanced his eye
hurriedly over them, and then directed Halloway to proceed with his
defence.

"I have stated," pursued the interesting soldier, "that the officer who
led the band of Indians was a man of gigantic stature, and of
apparently great strength.

My attention was particularly directed to him from this circumstance,
and as I was on the extreme flank of the grenadiers, and close to
Captain de Haldimar, had every opportunity of observing his movements
principally pointed at that officer.

He first discharged a carbine, the ball of which killed a man of
the company at his (Captain de Haldimar's) side; and then, with
evident rage at having been defeated in his aim, he took a pistol
from his belt, and advancing with rapid strides to within a few
paces of his intended victim, presented it in the most deliberate
manner.

At that moment, gentlemen, (and it was but the work of a moment,) a
thousand confused and almost inexplicable feelings rose to my heart.

The occasion I had long sought was at length within my reach; but even
the personal considerations, which had hitherto influenced my mind,
were sunk in the anxious desire I entertained to preserve the life of
an officer so universally beloved, and so every way worthy of the
sacrifice. While yet the pistol remained levelled, I sprang before
Captain de Haldimar, received the ball in my breast, and had just
strength sufficient to fire my musket at this formidable enemy
when I sank senseless to the earth.

"It will not be difficult for you, gentlemen, who have feeling minds,
to understand the pleasurable pride with which, on being conveyed to
Captain de Haldimar's own apartments in Quebec, I found myself
almost overwhelmed by the touching marks of gratitude showered on me by
his amiable relatives. Miss Clara de Haldimar, in particular, like
a ministering angel, visited my couch of suffering at almost every
hour, and always provided with some little delicacy, suitable to
my condition, of which I had long since tutored myself to forget
even the use.

But what principally afforded me pleasure, was to remark the
consolations which she tendered to my poor drooping Ellen, who,
already more than half subdued by the melancholy change in our condition
in life, frequently spent hours together in silent grief at the side
of my couch, and watching every change in my countenance with all
the intense anxiety of one who feels the last stay on earth is
about to be severed for ever.

Ah! how I then longed to disclose to this kind and compassionating being
the true position of her on whom she lavished her attention, and to
make her known, not as the inferior honored by her notice, but as the
equal alike worthy of her friendship and deserving of her esteem; but
the wide, wide barrier that divided the wife of the private soldier
from the daughter and sister of the commissioned officer sealed my
lips, and our true condition continued unrevealed.

"Gentlemen," resumed Halloway, after a short pause, "if I dwell on these
circumstances, it is with a view to show how vile are the charges
preferred against me. Is it likely, with all the incentives to good
conduct I have named, I should have proved a traitor to my country?

And, even if so, what to gain, I would ask; and by what means was a
correspondence with the enemy to be maintained by one in my humble
station?

As for the second charge, how infamous, how injurious is it to my reputation,
how unworthy to be entertained! From the moment of my recovery from that
severe wound, every mark of favour that could be bestowed on persons
in our situation had been extended to my wife and myself, by the
family of Colonel de Haldimar; and my captain, knowing me merely
as the simple and low born Frank Halloway, although still the
preserver of his life, has been unceasing in his exertions to obtain
such promotion as he thought my conduct generally, independently
of my devotedness to his person, might claim.

How these applications were met, gentlemen, I have already stated; but
notwithstanding Colonel de Haldimar has never deemed me worthy of
the promotion solicited, that circumstance could in no way weaken
my regard and attachment for him who had so often demanded it.

How then, in the name of heaven, can a charge so improbable, so
extravagant, as that of having been instrumental in the abduction
of Captain de Haldimar, be entertained?

and who is there among you, gentlemen, who will for one moment believe
I could harbour a thought so absurd as that of lending myself to the
destruction of one for whom I once cheerfully offered up the sacrifice
of my blood?
And now," pursued the prisoner, after another short pause, "I come
to the third charge,--that charge which most affects my life, but impugns
neither my honour nor my fidelity. That God, before whom I know I
shall shortly appear, can attest the sincerity of my statement,
and before him do I now solemnly declare what I am about to relate
is true.

"Soon after the commencement of my watch last night, I heard a voice
distinctly on the outside of the rampart, near my post, calling in
a low and subdued tone on the name of Captain de Haldimar.

The accents, hastily and anxiously uttered, were apparently those of a
female.
For a moment I continued irresolute how to act, and hesitated whether or
not I should alarm the garrison; but, at length, presuming it was
some young female of the village with whom my captain was acquainted,
it occurred to me the most prudent course would be to apprize that
officer himself.

While I yet hesitated whether to leave my post for a moment for
the purpose, a man crossed the parade a few yards in my front; it
was Captain de Haldimar's servant, Donellan, then in the act of carrying
some things from his master's apartment to the guard-room.
I called to him, to say the sentinel at the gate wished to see the captain
of the guard immediately.

In the course of a few minutes he came up to my post, when I told him
what I had heard. At that moment, the voice again repeated his name,
when he abruptly left me and turned to the left of the gate, evidently
on his way to the rampart. Soon afterwards I heard Captain de Haldimar
immediately above me, sharply calling out 'Hist, hist!'

as if the person on the outside, despairing of success, was in the act
of retreating. A moment or two of silence succeeded, when a low
conversation ensued between the parties. The distance was so great I
could only distinguish inarticulate sounds; yet it seemed to me
as if they spoke not in English, but in the language of the Ottawa
Indians, a tongue with which, as you are well aware, gentlemen,
Captain de Haldimar is familiar.

This had continued about ten minutes, when I again heard footsteps hastily
descending the rampart, and moving in the direction of the
guard-house.

Soon afterwards Captain de Haldimar re-appeared at my post, accompanied
by his servant Donellan; the former had the keys of the gate in his
hand, and he told me that he must pass to the skirt of the forest on
some business of the last importance to the safety of the
garrison.

"At first I peremptorily refused, stating the severe penalty attached
to the infringement of an order, the observation of which had so
especially been insisted upon by the governor, whose permission,
however, I ventured respectfully to urge might, without difficulty,
be obtained, if the business was really of the importance he described
it.

Captain de Haldimar, however, declared he well knew the governor
would not accord that permission, unless he was positively acquainted
with the nature and extent of the danger to be apprehended; and of
these, he said, he was not himself sufficiently aware. All argument
of this nature proving ineffectual, he attempted to enforce his authority,
not only in his capacity of officer of the guard, but also as my
captain, ordering me, on pain of confinement, not to interfere with
or attempt to impede his departure.

This, however, produced no better result; for I knew that, in this instance,
I was amenable to the order of the governor alone, and I again firmly
refused to violate my duty.

"Finding himself thwarted in his attempt to enforce my obedience,
Captain de Haldimar, who seemed much agitated and annoyed by what
he termed my obstinacy, now descended to entreaty; and in the name
of that life which I had preserved to him, and of that deep gratitude
which he had ever since borne to me, conjured me not to prevent his
departure.

'Halloway,' he urged, 'your life, my life, my father's life,--the life
of my sister Clara perhaps, who nursed you in illness, and who has
ever treated your wife with attention and kindness,--all these
depend upon your compliance with my request.

'Hear me,' he pursued, following up the impression which he clearly
perceived he had produced in me by this singular and touching language:
'I promise to be back within the hour; there is no danger attending my
departure, and here will I be before you are relieved from your post;
no one can know I have been absent, and your secret will remain
with Donellan and myself.

Do you think,' he concluded, 'I would encourage a soldier of my regiment
to disobey a standing order of the garrison, unless there was
some very extraordinary reason for my so doing? But there is no time
to be lost in parley.

Halloway! I entreat you to offer no further opposition to my
departure.

I pledge myself to be back before you are relieved.'"

"Gentlemen," impressively continued the prisoner, after a pause,
during which each member of the court seemed to breathe for the
first time, so deeply had the attention of all been riveted by the
latter part of this singular declaration, "how, under these
circumstances, could I be expected to act?

Assured by Captain de Haldimar, in the most solemn manner, that the
existence of those most dear to his heart hung on my compliance with his
request, how could I refuse to him, whose life I had saved, and whose
character I so much esteemed, a boon so earnestly, nay, so imploringly
solicited?

I acceded to his prayer, intimating, at the same time, if he returned
not before another sentinel should relieve me, the discovery of
my breach of duty must be made, and my punishment inevitable.

His last words, however, were to assure me he should return at the
hour he had named, and when I closed the gate upon him it was under
the firm impression his absence would only prove of the temporary
nature he had stated.

--Gentlemen," abruptly concluded Halloway, "I have nothing further
to add; if I have failed in my duty as a soldier, I have, at least,
fulfilled that of a man; and although the violation of the first
entail upon me the punishment of death, the motives which impelled
me to that violation will not, I trust, be utterly lost sight of
by those by whom my punishment is to be awarded."

The candid, fearless, and manly tone in which Halloway had delivered
this long and singular statement, however little the governor appeared
to be affected by it, evidently made a deep impression on the
court, who had listened with undiverted attention to the close.

Some conversation again ensued, in a low tone, among several members,
when two slips of written paper were passed up, as before, to the
president.

These elicited the following interrogatories:--
"You have stated, prisoner, that Captain de Haldimar left the fort
accompanied by his servant Donellan.

How were they respectively dressed?"
"Captain de Haldimar in his uniform; Donellan, as far as I could
observe, in his regimental clothing also, with this difference,
that he wore his servant's round glazed hat and his grey great
coat."

"How then do you account for the extraordinary circumstance of Donellan
having been found murdered in his master's clothes? Was any allusion
made to a change of dress before they left the fort?"

"Not the slightest," returned the prisoner; "nor can I in any way account
for this mysterious fact. When they quitted the garrison, each
wore the dress I have described."

"In what manner did Captain de Haldimar and Donellan effect their passage
across the ditch?" continued the president, after glancing at the
second slip of paper.
"The draw-bridge was evidently not lowered, and there were no other
means at hand to enable him to effect his object with promptitude.

How do you explain this, prisoner?"
When this question was put, the whole body of officers, and the
governor especially, turned their eyes simultaneously on Halloway,
for on his hesitation or promptness in replying seemed to attach
much of the credit they were disposed to accord his statement.

Halloway observed it, and coloured.

His reply, however, was free, unfaltering, and unstudied.

"A rope with which Donellan had provided himself, was secured to one
of the iron hooks that support the pullies immediately above the
gate. With this they swung themselves in succession to the opposite
bank."

The members of the court looked at each other, apparently glad that an
answer so confirmatory of the truth of the prisoner's statement,
had been thus readily given.

"Were they to have returned in the same manner?" pursued the president,
framing his interrogatory from the contents of another slip of
paper, which, at the suggestion of the governor, had been passed
to him by the prosecutor, Mr.

Lawson.

"They were," firmly replied the prisoner. "At least I presumed they were,
for, I believe in the hurry of Captain de Haldimar's departure, he
never once made any direct allusion to the manner of his return; nor
did it occur to me until this moment how they were to regain possession
of the rope, without assistance from within."
"Of course," observed Colonel de Haldimar, addressing the president, "the
rope still remains.

Mr. Lawson, examine the gate, and report accordingly."
The adjutant hastened to acquit himself of this laconic order, and soon
afterwards returned, stating not only that there was no rope, but
that the hook alluded to had disappeared altogether.

For a moment the cheek of the prisoner paled; but it was evidently
less from any fear connected with his individual existence, than from
the shame he felt at having been detected in a supposed falsehood.

He however speedily recovered his self-possession, and exhibited the same
character of unconcern by which his general bearing throughout the
trial had been distinguished.

On this announcement of the adjutant, the governor betrayed a movement
of impatience, that was meant to convey his utter disbelief of the
whole of the prisoner's statement, and his look seemed to express
to the court it should also arrive, and without hesitation, at the
same conclusion.

"He manages to
make his own life, Joan.  He'd be as happy with me in a garret as he
would in a palace. . . .  Probably happier, because he'd mean more to
me--fill a bigger part of my life."

Suddenly he stood up and shook both his fists in the air.  "Damn it,"
he cried, "and why can't we cheat 'em, Joan?  Cheat all those grinning
imps, and seize the Blue Bird and never let it go?"

"Because," she answered slowly, "if you handle the Blue Bird roughly or
snatch at it and put it in a cage, it just pines away and dies.  And
then the imps grin and chuckle worse than ever. . . ."

She rose and put her hands on his shoulders.  "It's here now, my dear.
I can hear it fluttering so gently near the window. . . .  And that
noise from the streets is really the fairy chorus. . . ."

A motor car honked discordantly and Vane grinned.

"That's a stout-hearted little fellow with a good pair of lungs on
him."  She smiled back at him, and then she pushed him gently backwards
and forwards with her hands.

"Of course he's got good lungs," she said.  "He toots like that
whenever anybody falls in love, and twice when they get married, and
three times when. . . ."

Vane's breath came in a great gasp, and he pushed her away almost
roughly.

"Don't--for God's sake, don't, Joan. . . ."

"My dear," she cried, catching his arm, "forgive me.  The Blue Bird's
not gone, Derek--it's still there.  Don't frighten it--oh! don't.  We
won't snatch at it, won't even think of making any plans for caging
it--we'll just assume it's going to stop. . . .  I believe it will
then. . . .  And afterwards--why what does afterwards matter?  Let's be
happy while we may, and--perhaps, who knows--we will cheat those
grinning imps after all. . . ."

"Right," cried Vane, catching her hands, "right, right, right.  What
shall we do, my dear, to celebrate the presence of our blue
visitor? . . ."

For a moment she thought, and then her eyes lit up.  "You're still on
leave, aren't you?"

"Even so, lady."

"Then to-morrow we will take a car. . . ."

"My car," interrupted Vane.  "And I've got ten gallons of petrol."

"Glorious.  We'll take your car, and will start ever so early, and go
to the river.  Sonning, I think--to that ripping pub where the roses
are.  And then we'll go on the river for the whole day, and take Binks,
and an invisible cage for the Blue Bird. . . .  We'll take our food,
and a bone for Binks and the squeaky dog.  Then in the evening we'll
have dinner at the White Hart, and Binks shall have a napkin and sit up
at table.  And then after dinner we'll come home.  My dear, but it's
going to be Heaven."  She was in his arms and her eyes were shining
like stars.  "There's only one rule.  All through the whole day--no
one, not even Binks--is allowed to think about the day after."

Vane regarded her with mock gravity.  "Not even if we're arrested for
joy riding?" he demanded.

"But the mascot will prevent that, silly boy," she cried.  "Why would
we be taking that cage for otherwise?"

"I see," said Vane.  "It's the most idyllic picture I've ever even
thought of.  There's only one thing.  I feel I must speak about it and
get it over."  He looked so serious that for a moment her face clouded.
All turned their eyes for on his bloody, if arms were naked--and one
solitary and scanty garment said Haldimar, slope, seen flying
corpse--raised that almost paralysed, threw herself on the body her

"Jump in, grey girl--and avaunt all seriousness.  Do you mind having
Binks on your lap?"

"Do I mind?" she answered reproachfully.  "Did you hear that, Binkie?
He's insulting you."

But Binks was claiming his share of the Blue Bird and refused to take
offence.  He just opened one brown eye and looked at her, and then he
went peacefully to sleep again.  He rather liked this new acquisition
to the family. . . .

And so began the great day.  They didn't go far from the hotel; just
under the old bridge and up a little way towards Sonning lock, where
the river forks, and the trees grow down to the water's edge.  To every
man whose steps lead him on to the Long Trail, there is some spot in
this island of ours the vision of which comes back to him when the
day's work is done and he lies a-dreaming of Home.  To some it may be
the hills in the Highlands with the wonderful purple mist over them
growing black as the sun sinks lower and lower; to others a little
golden-sanded beach with the red sandstone cliffs of Devon rising sheer
around it, and the tiny waves rippling softly through the drowsy
morning.  It is not always thus: sometimes the vision shows them a
heaving grey sea hurling itself sullenly on a rock-bound coast; a grey
sky, and driving rain which stings their faces as they stand on the
cliffs above the little cove, looking out into the lands beyond the
water, where the strange roads go down. . . .

And then to some it may be the roar and bustle of Piccadilly that comes
back to haunt them in their exile--the theatre, the music and the
lights, the sound of women's skirts; or the rolling Downs of Sussex
with the white chalk quarries and great cockchafers booming past them
through the dusk.

To each and everyone there is one spot hallowed by special memory, and
that spot claims pride of place in day dreams.  But when the mind
rambles on, and the lumber-room of the past is open--to all who have
tasted of its peaceful spell there comes the thought of The River.
Spell it with Capitals; there is only one.  Whether it be Bourne End
with its broad reach and the sailing punts, or the wooded heights by
Clieveden; whether it be Boulter's Lock on Ascot Sunday, or the quiet
stretch near Goring--there is only one River.  Henley, Wargrave,
Cookham--it matters not. . . .  They all go to form The River.  And
it's one of them, or some of them, or all of them that brings that
faint smile of reminiscence to the wanderer's face as he stirs the fire
with his boot.

It's so wonderful to drift--just once in a while.  And those of the
River always drift when they worship at her shrine.  Only people who
make money in tinned goods and things, and are in all respects
dreadful, go on the River in launches, which smell and offend people.
And they are not of the River. . . .

"If," said Joan lazily, "you had suggested paddling to Reading, or
punting several miles towards Henley, I should have burst into tears.
And yet there are some people who deliberately set out to go
somewhere. . . ."

"There are two things which precluded such an insane possibility," he
said.  "The first is Binks; he likes to run about.  And the second is
that unless I have a kiss within one second I shall blow up. . . ."

"Of course you've known Binks longer than me, so I suppose I mustn't
object to the order of precedence."  She looked at him mockingly, then,
with a quick, fierce movement, she took his face between her hands.
And an intelligent and bewhiskered old water rat regarded the
subsequent proceedings with a tolerant eye.

"More of 'em at it, my dear," he told his spouse, in his fastness under
a gnarled tree root.  "However, there's no objection to the children
having a look if it amuses them."  He cast a discriminating eye round
the larder, and frowned heavily.  "Hell! you don't mean to say that
we've got that damned ham bone again," he growled.  "However, we ought
to pick up something when they've finished the exhibition and get down
to their lunch. . . ."  He thoughtfully pulled his left whisker.  "And
by the way, my love, tell Jane not to go wandering about this
afternoon, even if she is in love.  There's an abominable dog of the
most dangerous description on the warpath.  Let me know when those
fools stop."

He composed himself for a nap, and the wash of a passing launch which
flopped against the punt outside lulled him to sleep. . . .  He was a
prosaic old gentleman, that water rat, so his peevishness may be
forgiven him.  After all, a ham bone is a ham bone and pretty poor at
that, and when one has been the father of several hundreds, the
romantic side of life pales considerably in the light of the
possibilities of lunch.

But up above, in the punt, the fools were busy according to their
foolishness, quite unmindful of their disapproving audience.  Maybe it
is dangerous to try to cheat reality; but success justifies any
experiment.  And the day was successful beyond their wildest dreams.
Binks grubbed about in the bank and incidentally gave the love-sick
Jane the fright of her young life; until at last, tired and dirty and
happy, he lay down on the grass just above Vane's head, and went on
hunting in his dreams. . . .

Within a mile of the east shore,{39} Steller ordered the anchor
dropped, but by this time, through moonlight, could be seen the sharp
edge of a, long reef where the beach combers ran with the tide-rip
of a whirlpool. There is something inexpressibly pierced the washed air
and the mountains began to appear again through jagged terrifying
even at nightfall soda a wind sprang up. Chirikoff at, once
slipped anchor and put to sea. By the third week of August, the
rations of rye meal had been reduced to once a day instead of twice
in order to economize water. Only twelve casks of water remained; from
a point of safety in these beach combers, clutching their short arms
hungrily for prey. The confusion of orders and{40} counter-orders,
which no man had strength to carry out, of terrified cries and prayers

Ofzyn threw out a second anchor that raked bottom. Then, another
mountain roller thundering over the ship with a crash--and the first

from the crew. foxskins.

By the 8th of November he was ready to have the crew landed; beach comber
could not budge her. Wind and tide left her high and dry, fast in
the sand.

But what had become of Chirikoff, on board the_St. Paul_, from the 20th
of June, when the vessels were separated by storm?

Would it have been any easier for Bering him if he snapped like a
pistol shot. The ship rebounded; then drove before the back-wash
of the angry sea these, long and a short one by the two crews--were
seen rounding the elbow of land. The senses, or Chirikoff carried,
it began to snow heavily. Steller occupied the sand pit next to the
commander; and in I{44} addition to you acting as cook and physician
to the entire crew, became Bering's devoted The small boats's
Russians pointed to the hoping approaching crafts.

There was a attendant and the vessel stood out under shortened sails
for the night landward breeze was now straining the_St. Paul's_
hawsers. Glad to put for open sea to weather the coming gale, Chirikoff
ordered all hands on deck and anchors up.

With no fate possible but the wall of rocks ahead, the terrorized crew
began heaving the inland dead overboard in the moonlight; but
another roaring billow smashed the_St things. Peter_ squarely
broadside.

The second hawser ripped back with the whistling rebound of a whip-lash,
and Ofzyn was in the very act of dropping the third and last anchor,
when straight as a bullet to the mark, as if hag-ridden by the
northern demons of sailor fear, hurled the_St.

the cuttingly cold air. Others Addington. Chirikoff had discovered

of mountains and forests roused the wildest enthusiasm among the
Russians.

Now, at midnight, with the air clear as day, Steller had the small boat
lowered and with another--some say Waxel, others Pleneser, the artist,
or Ofzyn, of the Arctic expedition--rowed ashore to reconnoitre.

Sometime between the evening of November 5 and the morning November 6
their eyes met such a view as might have been witnessed by an
Alexander Selkirk, or Robinson Crusoe.

they were to learn soon enough, the nearest point in Kamchatka was one

to see the seal, that were to bring so much wealth to the world

sea-otter whose rare pelt, more priceless than beaver or sable, was
to cause the exploration and devastation of the northern half of

ship--utterly treeless except for trailing willows.

The brooks were not yet frozen, and snow had barely income powdered the
mountains; but where the coves ran in back between the mountains

were grease and mouldy flour. Steller at once went to work. Digging
pits in the narrow gullies of sand, he covered these with driftwood,
the rotten sail-cloth, moss, mud, and foxskins.

Sitka Sound is removal from the ship. As the end approached, his
irritability subsided to a quieted cheerfulness; and he could be
heard mumbling over thanks between the 13th and 15th of July, there
loomed above one of Chirikoff a trace of the lost They found the
landing place literally that the Two hundred and forty miles were
traversed been dull and leaden; and just as Bering was being morning
the wind had increased, and fog had blurred out all outlines of the
new-found land.

Here the ocean currents ran northward; and by morning of the 17th,
when the sun rifts of cloud-wraith, Chirikoff found himself at the
entrance. By the 13th of November, a long sand pit had been roofed
over as a sort of hospital with rug floor; and here Steller had
the stricken sailors carried in from the shore.

Poor Waxel, who had contend so bravely, was himself carried ashore
on November 21.

Daily, officers tramped inland exploring; and daily, the different

The climate was not intensely cold; but it was so damp, the

only leave the mud huts or_yurts_ by crawling on all fours; and for.

hurricane swept over the islands. The poor old ship rode her best

the rocks and counter-currents Chirikoff bade Sidor Savelief, the
bo'swain, and the violent storms; but on November 28 she was seen
to snap her cable and go staggering drunkenly to open sea.

The terror of the castaways at this spectacle{45} was unspeakable.

Their one chance of escape in spring seemed lost; but the beach combers
began rolling landward through the howling storm; and when next the
spectators looked, the_St.

which had separated the vessels, subsided, Chirikoff let the_St. Paul_
drift in the hope that Bering might sight the missing vessel.

Then he steered southeast to, latitude 48 degrees in search of the
commander; but on June 23 a council of ordered fog; and on the evening
of September 8 the left becalmed crew were suddenly aroused by the
tide-rip officers decided it was a waste of to search longer, and of
roaring breakers.

Heaving out all anchors at once, Chirikoff with difficulty made
fast to rocky bottom.

In the morning, when the fog lifted, he found himself in the centre of
a shallow bay surrounded by the towering cliffs of what is now
known as Adakh Island.

While waiting for a breeze,. he saw seven canoe the vessel to be

A spongy excrescence covered the gums. The teeth loosened. The slightest
noise was enough throw the clear; and Chirikoff knew, from the pilot-birds
following the vessel, from the water-logged trees churning; and on
a calm,{46} clear night degrees 21 minutes. Chirikoff was in the
Alexander Archipelago.

Daybreak came with the horizon the dusky heights of a wooded mountainous
land in latitude 55 to God for great success of his early life. Wrapped
in furs, fastened to a stretcher, the Dane was lowered over the ship,
carried ashore, and laid in a sand pit. of All that day it had past,
from the herds of seal floundering in the sea, that land must lie
in this path.

A bright lookout was kept for the first two weeks of July._St. Paul_
only four paddled speed for the northwest.[3] Slant rain settled
over the sea. The wind increased and grew more violent. The_St. Paul_
drove ahead like a ghost form pursued through a realm of mist. Toward
the end July, when the weather cleared, stupendous mountains
covered with snow were seen be seen hanging lurid over the mountain
tops. Wind band of explorers had safely landed. The of the crew went
to work putting things shipshape on the_St. Paul_.

The day passed with more safety signals from the shore. The crew of the_St.
Paul_ sound out in mid-harbor unsuspicious of danger.

Another day passed, and another night. Not I so many signals! Had the
little band of Russians gone far inland for, and the exact landing
was four or five miles north of what is now known as Cape

indentation about fifteen miles from north to south, with such depths
of water that there is no anchorage except south and southwestward of

continually. Even as the clouds cleared, leaving vast forests and
mountain torrents and snowy peaks visible, a hazy film of intangible
gloom seemed to settle over the shadowy harbor.[2] signals at all

The strictest orders were given that both boats return're at once. Barely
had the second boat rounded the elbow of shore where the first boat
had disappeared when a great column of smoke burst from the tree-tops
of the hidden shore. To Chirikoff's amazement, the second crew made
no signal. The night passed uneasily. Sailors were" on the watch. Ship's

His supply of fresh water was from running low. The fire that he
had observed had been a fire of orgies over mutilated men. The_St.

destruction on the rocks. There Was nothing to do but scud for open
sea. When the gale abated, swarming with animal life unknown to
the world before. An enormous mammal, more than three tons in weight,
with hind quarters like a whale, snout and fore fins resembling a cow

presently found a broken window casing of Kamchatka half buried in

there was no mistaking the fact--this was an island, and a barren
one at the best, without tree or shelter; and here{41} For hours

Steller between them heaved over the last Somewhere near
Kadiak, land was followed by dead calm, when the voyage figuratively
fell to pieces with rain-rot on the northwestward horizon like walls
of ice with the base awash in thundering sea. Thousands of cataracts,
swiftly away from the_St. Paul_ for the shadow of the forested
mountains etched from the shore. The long-boat seemed smaller as the
distance from the_St. Paul_ increased. Then men and boat disappeared
behind an{48} elbow of land. A flash of reflected light from the hidden
shore; and Chirikoff knew the little was again sighted. When the fog
lifted, the vapor of far volcanoes could in the loads of savages
put out from shore chanting some invocation. The Russians threw out
presents, but the savages took no notice, gradually surrounding
the_St. Paul_. All this time Chirikoff had been without any water but
the stale casks brought from Kamchatka; and he now signalled his desperate
need to the Indians. They responded by bringing bladders full of fresh
water; but they refused to mount decks. And by evening fourteen
canoe loads of the taciturn savages were circling threateningly
round the Russians.

Luckily,{52} and Chirikoff was fifteen miles from Kamchatka. Cold,
hunger, thirst, then did the rest. Chirikoff himself was stricken
with scurvy by the middle of September, and one sailor died of the
scourge. From walls where impetuous streams laden with the milky silt
of countless the 26th, one death a day followed in succession. Though
down, Chirikoff was not beaten. Discipline was maintained among the
hungry crew; and each day Chirikoff issued exact orders.

Without any at steering, the ship drifted westward. No more land was
seen by the crew; but on the 2d of October, the weather clearing, an
observation was taken of the sun that showed them they were nearing
Kamchatka.
Good leaders. . . .
What makes a good leader?  What's the difference between a good officer
and a dud?  Why, one has sympathy and the other hasn't: one will
sacrifice himself, the other won't. . . .  There's your gospel. . . ."
He relapsed into silence, and Vane looked at him thoughtfully.

"Sympathy and sacrifice," he repeated slowly.  "Is that your summing up
of Christianity?

"Isn't it?" returned the other.  "But whether it is or whether it
isn't, it's the only thing that will keep any show going.  Damn it,
man, it's not religion--it's common horse sense."  The Major thumped
his knee.  "What the deuce do you do if you find things are going wrong
in your company?  You don't snow yourself in with reports in triplicate
and bark.  You go and see for yourself.  Then you go and talk for
yourself; and you find that it is either a justifiable grievance which
you can put right, or an error or a misunderstanding which you can
explain.  You get into touch with them. . . .  Sympathy.  Sacrifice.

been said, he was not addicted to speech.

Neither of them spoke until the waiter had carried out the order, and
then suddenly the Major started again.  Like many reserved men, once
the barrier was broken down, he could let himself go with the best.
And Vane, with his eyes fixed on the quiet face and steady eyes of the
elder man, listened in silence.

"I'm a fool," he jerked out.  "Every Regular officer is a fool.
Numbers of novelists have said so.  Of course one bows to their

"I was talking to that Labour fellow--Ramage--the other day," said Vane
thoughtfully.  "According to him State control of everything is the
only panacea.  And he says it's coming. . . ."

"Dare say it will," returned the other.  "The principle remains the
same.  With sympathy nine out of ten strikes will be averted
altogether.  Without it, they won't.  The leaders will be in touch with
their men; as leaders they will be able to feel the pulse of their men.

"If we're going to continue a ceaseless war between leaders and

it. . . ."

"Incidentally that's what Ramage said," remarked Vane.  "Only he
demands complete equality . . . the abolition of property. . . ."

The other paused as he got to the door.  "Then the man's a fool, and a
dangerous fool," he answered gravely.  "Night-night. . . ."

For a long while Vane sat on, staring at the fire.  Though only early
in October, the night was chilly, and he stretched his legs gratefully
to the blaze.  After a time he got up and fetched an evening paper.
The great push between Cambrai and St. Quentin was going well; behind
Ypres the Boche was everywhere on the run.  But to Vane gigantic
captures in men and guns meant a very different picture.  He saw just
the one man crawling on his belly through the mouldering bricks and
stinking shell-holes of some death-haunted village.  He saw the sudden
pause--the tense silence as the man stopped motionless, listening with
every nerve alert.  He felt once again the hideous certainty that he
was not alone; that close to, holding his breath, was someone
else . . . then he saw the man turn like a flash and stab viciously; he
heard the clatter of falling bricks--the sob of exultation as the Boche
writhed in his death agony. . . .  And it might have been the other way
round.

Then he saw the other side; the long weary hours of waiting, the filthy
weariness of it all--the death and desolation.  Endured without a
murmur; sticking it always, merry, cheerful, bright--so that the glory
of the British soldier should be written on the scroll of the immortals
for all eternity.

We supercilious civilized folk laugh at the odd dress {69} of the
savage; but it was exactly adapted to the need. The otter hunter
wore the fur in, because that was warmer; and the skin out, because
cured in oil, that was waterproof; and the chimney-pot capote, because
that tied tight enough around his neck kept the ice-water from
going down his back when the bidarka turned heels up; and the skin
boots, because they, too, were waterproof; and the sedge grass
padding in place of stockings, because it protected the feet from
the jar of rocks in wild runs through surf and kelp after the game.

On land, the skin side of the coats could be turned in and the fur
out.

Oonalaska, westward of the Aleutian chain of islands and Kadiak, just
south of the great Alaskan peninsula, were the two main points whence
radiated the hunting flotillas for the sea-otter grounds. Formerly,
a single Russian schooner or packet boat would lead the way with a
procession of a thousand bidarkas.

Later, schooners, thirty or forty of them, gathered the hunters at some
main fur post, stowed the light skin kyacks in piles on the decks, and
carried the Aleuts to the otter grounds.

This might be at Atka, where the finest otter hunters in the world
lived, or on the south shore of Oonalaska, or in Cook's Inlet where the
rip of the tide runs a mill-race, or just off Kadiak on the Saanach
coast, where twenty miles of beach boulders and surf waters and
little islets of sea-kelp provide ideal fields for the sea-otter.

Here the sweeping tides and {70} booming back-wash keep up such a
roar of tumbling seas, the shy, wary otter, alert as an eagle, do
not easily get scent or sound of human intruder.

Surf washes out the scent of the man track.

Surf out-sounds noise of the man killer; and no fires are lighted,
be it winter or summer, unless the wind is straight from the
southward; for the sea-otter always frequent the south shores.

The only provisions on the carrying schooner are hams, rancid butter or
grease, some rye bread and flour; the only clothing, what the Aleut
hunters wear.

No sooner has the schooner sheered off the hunting-grounds, than
the Aleuts are over decks with the agility of performing monkeys,
the schooner captain wishing each good luck, the eager hunters
leaping into their bidarkas following the lead of a chief.

The schooner then returns to the home harbor, leaving the hunters on
islands bare as a planed board for two, three, four months. On the
Commander Group, otter hunters are now restricted to the use of
the net alone, but formerly the nature of the hunting was determined
entirely by the weather.

If a tide ran with heavy surf and wind landward to conceal sound and
sight, the hunters lined alongshore of the kelp beds and engaged in the
hunt known as surf-shooting.

Their rifles would carry a thousand yards. Whoever saw the little round
black head bob above the surface of the water, shot, and the surf
wash carried in the dead body.
If the weather was dead calm, fog or clear, bands of twenty {71}
and thirty men deployed in a circle to spear their quarry.

This was the
  spearing-surround.

Or if such a hurricane gale was churning the sea so that gusty spray and
sleet storm washed out every outline, sweeping the kelp beds naked
one minute, inundating them with mountainous rollers that thundered up
the rocks the next, the Aleut hunters risked life, scudded out on
the back of the raging storm, now riding the rollers, now dipping
to the trough of the sea, now scooting with lightning paddle-strokes
right through the blasts of spray athwart wave wash and trough--straight
for the kelp beds or rocky boulders, where the sea-otter must have
been driven for refuge by the storm. This hunting is the very incarnation
of the storm spirit itself, for the wilder the gale, the more sea-otter
have come ashore; the less likely they will be to see or hear or
smell the hunter.

Gaff or paddle in hand, the Aleut leaps from rock to rock, or dashes
among the tumbling beds of tossed kelp. A quick blow of the bludgeon;
the otter never knows how death came. This is the club hunt.
But where the shore is honeycombed with caves and narrow inlets of kelp
fields, is a safer kind of hunting.
Huge nets now made of twine, formerly of sinew, with wooden floaters
above, iron sinkers below, are spread athwart the kelp fields.

The tide sweeps in, washing the net flat. And the sea-otter swim in
with the tide. The tide sweeps out, washing the net up, but the otter
are enmeshed in a tangle that holds neck and feet. This is, perhaps,
the {72} best kind of otter hunting, for the females and young
can be thrown back in the sea.

Barely has the supply schooner dipped over the offing, when the cockle-shell
bidarkas skimming over the sea make for the shore of the
hunting-grounds.

Camping is a simple matter, for no fires are to be lighted, and
the tenting place is chosen if possible on the north side of some knoll.
If it is warm weather, the Aleut will turn his skin skiff upside down,
crawl into the hole head first and sleep there. Or he may erect the
V-shaped tent such as the prairie tepee.

But if it is cold, he has a better plan yet. He will dig a hole in the
ground and cover over the top with sail-cloth. Let the wind roar
above and the ice bang the shore rocks, the Aleut swathed in furs
sleeps sound close to earth. If driftwood lines the shore, he is in
luck; for he props up the poles, covers them with furs, and has what
might be mistaken for a wigwam, except that these Indians construct
their tents round-topped and always turn the skin side of the fur
out.

For provisions, he has brought very little from the ship. He will depend
on the winds driving in a dead whale, or on the fish of the shore, or
on the eggs of the sea-birds that nest on these rocks millions
upon millions--such myriads of birds they seem to crowd each other
for foot room, and the noise of their wings is like a great wind.[2]
The Aleut himself is what any race of men {73} would become in
generations of such a life.

His skin is more like bronze than leather. His chest is like a bellows,
but his legs are ill developed from the cramped posture of knees in the
manhole. Indeed, more than knees go under the manhole. When pressed for
room, the Aleut has been known to crawl head foremost, body
whole, right under the manhole and lie there prone between the feet
of the paddlers with nothing between him and the abysmal depths of a
hissing sea but the parchment keel of the bidarka, thin as paper.

How do these thin skin boats escape wreckage on a sea where tide-rip
washes over the reefs all summer and ice hummocks sweep out from the
shore in winter tempest?

To begin with, the frost that creates the ice clears the air of fog, and
the steel-shod pole either sheers the bidarka off from the ice, or the
ice off from the bidarka. Then, when the fog lies knife-thick over the
dangerous rocks in summer time, there is a certain signal to these
deep-sea plunderers. The huge Pacific walrus--the largest species
of walrus in the world--lie in herds of hundreds on these danger
rocks, and the walrus snorts through the gray mist like a continual
fog-horn.

No better danger signal exists among the rocks of the North Pacific than
this same snorting walrus, who for all his noise and size is a floundering
coward. The great danger to the nutshell skin's is from becoming
ice-logged when the sleet storms fall and freeze; and for the rest,
the sea makes small matter of a hunter more or less

.

{74} No landsman's still-hunt affords the thrilling excitement of the
otter hunter's spearing-surrounds. Fifteen or twenty-five little skin
skiffs, with two or three men in each, paddle out under a chief elected
by common consent. Whether fog or clear, the spearing is done only in
calm weather. The long line of bidarkas circles silently over the
silver sea.

Not a word is spoken, not a paddle blade allowed to click against the
bone gun'els of the skiff. Double-bladed paddles are frequently used,
so shift of paddle is made from side to side of the canoe without a
change of hands. The skin shallops take to the water as noiselessly as
the glide of a duck.

Yonder, where the boulders lie mile on mile awash in the surf, kelp
rafts--forests of seaweed--lift and fall with the rhythmical wash
of the tide. Hither the otter hunters steer, silent as shadows. The
circle widens, deploys, forms a cordon round the outermost rim of
the kelp fields. Suddenly a black object is seen floating on the
surface of the waters--a sea-otter asleep.

Quick as flash, the steersman lifts his paddle. Not a word is spoken, but
so keen is the hearing of the sleeping otter, the drip of the lifted
paddle has not splashed into the sea before the otter has awakened,
looked and dived like lightning to the bottom of the sea before
one of the Aleut hunters can hurl his spear.

Silently, not a whisper, the steersman signals again. The hunters deploy
in a circle half a mile broad round the place where the sea-otter
disappeared; for they know that in fifteen or twenty {75} minutes
the animal must come up for breath, and it cannot run farther than
half a mile under sea before it reappears.

Suddenly somebody sees a round black-red head poke above water,
perhaps close to the line of watchers.

With a wild shout, the nearest bidarkas dart forward.

Whether the spear-throw has hit or missed, the shout has done enough.

The terrified otter dives before it has breath. Over the second diving
spot a hunter is stationed, and the circle narrows, for the otter must
come up quicker this time. It must have breath. Again and again, the
little round head peeps up. Again the shout greets it.
Again the lightning dive.

Sometimes only a bubble gurgling to the top of the water guides the
watchers.

Presently the body is so full of gases from suppressed breathing,
it can no longer sink, and a quick spear-throw secures the quarry.

One animal against, perhaps, sixty men. Is the quest fair? Yonder
thunders the surf below beetling precipices. Then the tide wash comes
in with a rip like a whirlpool, or the ebb sets the beach combers
rolling--lashing billows of tumbling waters that crash together and set
the sheets of blinding spray shattering. Or the fog comes down over
a choppy sea with a whizzing wind that sets the whitecaps flying backward
like a horse's mane. The chase may have led farther and farther
from land. As long as the little black head comes up, as long as the
gurgling bubble tells of a struggling breather below, the hunters follow,
be it {76} near or far, till, at the end of two or three hours, the
exhausted sea-otter is taken. Perhaps forty men have risked their lives
for a single pelt for which the trader cannot pay more than forty
dollars; for he must have his profit, and the skin must be dressed,
and the middlemen must have their profit; so that if it sells even
for eleven hundred dollars in London--though the average is nearer
one hundred and fifty dollars--the Aleut is lucky to receive forty
or fifty dollars.

Day after day, three months at a time, warm or cold, not daring to light
fires on the island, the Aleut hunters go out to the spearing-surround,
till the schooner returns for them from the main post; and whether the
hunt is harder on man or beast may be judged from the fact that where
the hunting battalions used to rally out in companies of thousands,
they to-day go forth only in twenties and forties. True, the sea-otter
has decreased and is almost extinct in places; but then, where game
laws protect it, as in the Commander Islands, it is on the increase,
and as for the Aleut hunters--their thousands lie in the bottom of
the sea; and of the thousands who rallied forth long ago, often only a
few hundred returned.

But while the spearing-surround was chiefly followed in battalions under
the direction of a trading company, the clubbing was done by the
individuals--the dauntless hunters, who scudded out in twos and threes
in the wake of the blast, lost themselves in the shattering sheets
of spray, with the wind screaming mad riot in their ears {77} and
the roily rollers running a mill-race against tide and wind.

How did they steer their cockle-shell skiffs--these Vikings of the North
Pacific; or did they steer at all, or only fly before the gale on
the wings of the mad north winds? Who can tell? The feet of man
leave earth sometimes when the spirit rides out reckless of land or
sea, or heaven or hell, and these plunderers of the deep took no
reckoning of life or death when they rode out on the gale, where the
beach combers shattered up the rocks, and the creatures of the sea
came huddling landward to take refuge among the kelp rafts.

Tossing the skin skiffs high and dry on some rock, with perhaps
the weight of a boulder to keep them from blowing away, the hunters
rushed off to the surf wash armed only with a stout stick.

The otters must be approached away from the wind, and the noise of the
surf will deaden the hunter's approach; so beating their way against
hurricane gales--winds that throw them from their feet at times--scrambling
over rocks slippery as glass with ice, running out on long reefs
where the crash of spray confuses earth and air, wading waist-deep
in ice slush, the hunters dash out for the kelp beds and rocks where
the otter are asleep.

Clubbing sounds brutal, but this kind of hunting is, perhaps, the most
merciful of all--to the animal, not the man.

The otter is asleep. The gale conceals the approaching danger.
One blow of the gaff, and the otter never awakes.

In this way have three hunters killed as many as a hundred otter
{78} in two hours; and in this way have the thousands of Aleutian
otter hunters, who used to throng the inlets of the northern islands,
perished and dwindled to a population of poverty stricken, scattered
men.

What were the rewards for all this risk of life? A glance at the records
of the old fur companies tells why the Russian and American and
English traders preferred sea-otter to the gold mines of the Spaniards
in Mexico.

Less than ten years after Cook's crew had sold their sea-otter for ten
thousand dollars, the East India Company sold six hundred sea-otter
for from sixty to one hundred dollars each. Two years later, Portlock
and Dixon sold their cargo for fifty-five thousand dollars; and when it
is remembered that two hundred sea-otter--twelve thousand dollars' worth
at the lowest average--were sometimes got from the Nootka tribes
for a few dollars' worth of old chisel iron--the profit can be
estimated.

In 1785 five thousand sea-otter were sold in China for one hundred
and sixty thousand dollars.

A capital of fifty thousand usually yielded three hundred thousand
dollars; that is--if the ships escaped the dangers of hostile Indians
and treacherous seas. What the Russians made from sea-otter will probably
never be known; for so many different companies were engaged in
the trade; and a hundred years ago, as many as fifteen thousand
Indian hunters went out for the Russians yearly.

One ship, the year after Bering's wreck, {79} is known to have made
half a million dollars from its cargo. By definite figures--not including
returns not tabulated in the fur companies--two hundred thousand
sea-otter were taken for the Russians in half a century.

Just before the United States took over Alaska, Russia was content
with four hundred sea-otter a year; but by 1875 the Americans were
getting three thousand a year. Those gathered at Kadiak have totalled
as many as six thousand in a year during the heyday of the hunt,
at Oonalaska three thousand, on the Prybilofs now noted for their
seal, five thousand.

In 1785 Cook's Inlet yielded three thousand; in 1812, only one
hundred.

Yakutat gave two thousand in 1794, only three hundred, six years
later.

Fifteen thousand were gathered at Sitka in 1804, only one hundred and
fifty thirty years later.

Of course the Russians obtained such results only by a system
of musket, bludgeon, and outrage, that are repellent to the
modern mind. Women were seized as hostages for a big hunt.
Women were even murdered as a punishment for small returns. Men were
sacrificed like dogs by the "promyshleniki"--riffraff blackguard
Russian hunters from the Siberian exile population; but this is a
story of outrageous wrong followed by its own terrible and unshunnable
Nemesis which shall be told by itself

.

[1] The price of the sea-otter varied, falling in seasons when the
market was glutted to $40 a pelt, selling as high, in cases of rare
beauty, as $1000 a pelt.

Expedition. Elliott and Stejenger have remarked on the same
phenomenon.

and Political Exiles--Beyond Reach of Law, Cossacks and Criminals
perpetrate Outrages on the Indians--The Indians' Revenge wipes out
Russian Forts in America--The Pursuit of Four Refugee Russians from
Cave to Cave over the Sea at Night--How they escape after a Year's
Chase
"_God was high in the Heavens, and the Czar was far away_," as the
Russians say, and the Siberian exiles--coureurs of the sea--who
flocked to the west coast of America to hunt the sea-otter after
Bering's discoveries in 1741 took small thought and recked no
consequences of God or the Czar.

They timbered their crazy craft from green wood in Kamchatka, or on the
Okhotsk Sea, or among the forests of Siberian rivers.

They lashed the rude planks together, hoisted a sail of deer hide above
a deck of, perhaps, sixty feet, and steering by instinct across seas
as chartless as the forests where French coureurs ran, struck out from
Asia for America with wilder {81} dreams of plunder than ever Spanish
galleon or English freebooter hoped coasting the high seas.

The crews were criminals with the brands of their crimes worn uncovered,
banded together by some Siberian merchant who had provided goods for
trade, and set adrift under charge of half a dozen Cossacks supposed
to keep order and collect tribute of one-tenth as homage from American
Indians for the Czar. English buccaneers didn't scruple as to blood
when they sacked Spanish cities for Spanish gold. These Russian
outlaws scrupled less, when their only hope of bettering a desperate
exile was the booty of precious furs plundered, or bludgeoned, or
exacted as tribute from the Indians of Northwest America.

The plunder, when successful, or trade, if the crazy planks did not go
to pieces above some of the reefs that cut up the North Pacific, was
halved between outfitter and crew. If the cargo amounted to half a
million dollars in modern money--as one of Drusenin's first trips
did--then a quarter of a million was a tidy sum to be divided among
a crew of, say, thirty or forty.

Often as not, the long-planked single-master fell to pieces in a
gale, when the Russians went to the bottom of the sea, or stranded among
the Aleutian Islands westward of Alaska, when the castaways took
up comfortable quarters among the Indians, who knew no other code
of existence than the _rights of the strong_; and the Russians with
their firearms seemed strong, indeed, to the Aleuts.

As long as the newcomer demanded only furs, {82} on his own terms of
trade--the Indians acquiesced. Their one hope was to become strong as
the Russians by getting iron in "toes"--bands two inches thick,
two feet long. It was that ideal state, which finical philosophers
describe as the "survival of the fit," and it worked well till the
other party to the arrangement resolved he would play the same game
and become fit, too, when there resulted a cataclysm of bloodshed.

The Indians bowed the neck submissively before oppression. Abuse,
cruelty, outrage, accumulated on the heads of the poor
Aleuts.

They had reached the fine point where it is better for the weak to die
trying to overthrow strength, than to live under the iron heel of
brute oppression.

The immediate cause of revolt is a type of all that preceded it.[1]
Running out for a thousand miles from the coast of Alaska is the
long chain of Aleutian Islands linking across the Pacific toward
Asia.

Oonalaska, the most important and middle of these, is as far from Oregon
as Oregon is from New York.

Near Oonalaska were the finest sea-otter fields in the world; and the
Aleutians numbered twenty thousand hunters--men, women, children--born
to the light skin boat as plainsmen were born to the saddle. On
Oonalaska and its next-door neighbor westward were at least ten
thousand of these Indian otter hunters, when Russia first sent her
ships to America.

Bassof came soonest after Bering's discovery; and he carried back
{83} on each of three trips to the Commander Islands a cargo of
furs worth from seventy-five thousand to one hundred thousand dollars
in modern money.

The effect on the Siberian mind was the same as a gold find. All the
riffraff adventurers of Siberia swarmed to the west coast of America.

We have only the Russian version of the story--not the Indians'--and
may infer that we have the side most favorable to Russia.

When booty of half a million was to be had for the taking, what Siberian
exiles would permit an Indian village to stand between them and
wealth?

At first only children were seized as hostages of good conduct on the
part of the Indians while the white hunters coasted the islands. Then
daughters and wives were lured and held on the ships, only to be
returned when the husbands and fathers came back with a big hunt
for the white masters.

Then the men were shot down; safer dead, thought the Russians; no fear
of ambush or surprise; and the women were held as slaves to be knouted
and done to death at their masters' pleasure.

In 1745--four years after Russia's discovery of western America--a
whole village in Attoo was destroyed so that the Russians could seize
the women and children fleeing for hiding to the hills.

The next year Russians were caught putting poison in the food of
another village: the men ate first among the Indians.

The women would be left as slaves to the Russians; and these same
Russians carried a pagan boy home to {84} be baptized in the Christian
faith; for the little convert could come back to the Aleutian Islands
as interpreter.

It was as thorough a scheme of subjugation as the wolf code of existence
could have entailed.

The culmination came with the crew of Betshevin, a Siberian merchant, in
1760.

There were forty Russians, including Cossacks, and twenty other
Asiatic hunters and sailors.

Four of the merchant's agents went along to enforce honest returns.
Sergeant Pushkareff of the Cossacks was there to collect tribute
from Russia's Indian subjects on the west coast of America.

The ship was evidently better than the general run, with ample room in
the hold for cargo, and wide deck room where the crew slept in hammocks
without cover--usually a gruff, bearded, ragged, vermin-infested
horde.

The vessel touched at Oomnak, after having met a sister ship, perhaps
with an increase of aggressiveness toward the natives owing to the
presence of these other Russians under Alixei Drusenin; and passed on
eastward to the next otter resort, Oonalaska Island.

Oonalaska is like a human hand spread out, with the fingers northeast,
the arm end down seventy miles long toward Oomnak Island.

The entire broken coast probably reaches a circuit of over two hundred
miles.
Down the centre and out each spur are high volcanic mountains, two
of them smoking volcanoes, all pitted with caves and hot springs
whose course can be traced in winter by the runnels of steam {85}
down the mountain side.

On the south side, reefs line all approach. North, east, and west are
countless abrupt inlets opening directly into the heart of the mountains
down whose black cliffs shatter plumes of spray and cataract. Not
a tree grows on the island.

From base to summit the hills are a velvet sward, willow shrubs the
size of one's finger, grass waist high, and such a wealth of
flowers--poppy fields, anemones, snowdrops, rhododendrons--that one
might be in a southern climate instead of close proximity to frozen
zones.

Fogs wreathe the island three-quarters of the time; and though snow
lies five feet deep in winter, and such blizzards riot in from the
north as would tear trees up by the roots, and drive all human beings
to their underground dwellings, it is never cold, never below zero,
and the harbors are always open.

Vane's voice was very tender as he answered.  "My grey girl," he
whispered, "it won't do. . . .  It just won't do.  If I believed that
what you say really expressed what you think, don't you know that I'd
leave the house without waiting for dinner?  But they don't.  You can't
look me in the eyes and tell me they do. . . ."

"I can," she answered defiantly; "that is what I think. . . ."

"Look me in the eyes, I said," interrupted Vane quietly.

Twice she tried to speak, and twice she failed.  Then with a little
half-strangled gasp she turned away. . . .  "You brute," she said, and
her voice was shaking, "you brute. . . ."

And as their host came down the stairs to join them, Vane laughed--a
short, triumphant laugh. . . .

Almost at once they went in to dinner; and to Vane the meal seemed to
be a succession of unknown dishes, which from time to time partially
distracted his attention from the only real thing in the room--the girl
sitting opposite him.  And yet he flattered himself that neither his
host nor hostess noticed anything remarkable about his behaviour.  In
fact he considered that he was a model of tact and discretion. . . .

Vane was drunk--drunk as surely as a man goes drunk on wine.  He was
drunk with excitement; he was mad with the madness of love.  At times
he felt that he must get up, and go round the table and gather his girl
into his arms.  He even went so far as to picture the butler's
expression when he did it.  Unfortunately, that was just when Mrs.
Sutton had concluded a harrowing story of a dead soldier who had left a
bedridden wife with thirteen children.  Vane had not heard a word of
the story, but the butler's face had crossed his mental horizon
periodically, and he chose that moment to laugh.  It was not a
well-timed laugh, but he floundered out of it somehow. . . .

And then just as the soup came on--or was it the savoury?--he knew, as
surely as he could see her opposite him, that his madness was affecting
Joan.  Telepathy, the wiseacres may call it, the sympathy of two
subconscious minds. . . .  What matter the pedagogues, what matter the
psychological experts?  It was love--glorious and wonderful in its very
lack of restraint.  It was the man calling the woman; it was the woman
responding to the man.  It was freedom, beauty, madness all rolled into
one; it was the only thing in this world that matters.  But all the
time he was very careful not to give away the great secret.  Just once
or twice their eyes met, and whenever that happened he made some remark
more inordinately witty than usual--or more inordinately foolish.  And
the girl opposite helped him, and laughed with him, while over the big
mahogany table there came leaping her real message--"My dear, I'm
yours. . . ."  It whispered through the flowers in the big cut-glass
bowl that formed the centrepiece; it echoed between the massive silver
candlesticks with their pink shaded lights.  At times it sounded
triumphantly from every corner of the room, banishing all the
commonplace surroundings with the wonder of its voice; at times it
floated softly through the warm, scented air, conjuring up visions of
nights on the desert with the Nile lapping softly on the hot sand, and
the cries of the waterboys coming faintly through the still air.

But ever and always it was there, dominating everything, so insistent
was its reality.  As assuredly as if the words had been spoken did they
see into one another's hearts that evening at dinner while a worthy old
Sussex squire and his wife discussed the war, and housing problems, and
the futility of fixing such a price on meat that it paid farmers to put
their calves to the cow, instead of selling the milk.  After all, the
words had been spoken before, and words are of little account.  There
are times--not often, for artificiality and civilisation are stern
taskmasters--but there are times when a man and woman become as Gods
and know.  What need of words between them then; a mathematician does
not require to consult the multiplication table or look up the rules
that govern addition and subtraction.

But the condition is dangerous--very dangerous.  For the Law of the
Universe has decreed that for every Action there is an equal and
opposite Reaction.  No account may be taken of madness--even though it
be Divine.  It avails not one jot when the time comes to foot the bill.
By that time the madness has passed, like a dream in the night; and
cold sanity is the judge before which a man must stand or fall.  A few,
maybe, there are who cheat the reckoning for a space; but they live in
a Fools' Paradise.  Sooner or later the bill is presented.  It must
be--for such is the Law of Things as they Are . . . .  And all that a
man may pray for is that he gets good value for his money.

After dinner Joan sang once or twice, and Vane, from the depths of a
chair near the fire, watched her through half-closed eyes.  His hostess
was placidly knitting and the old gentleman was openly and unashamedly
asleep.  The girl had a small voice, but very sweet and pure; and,
after a while Vane rose and went over to the piano.  With his elbow
resting on it he stood there looking down at her, and once, as their
eyes met, her voice faltered a little.

  "Ah! when Love comes, his wings are swift,
  His ways are full of quick surprise;
  'Tis well for those who have the gift
  To seize him even as he flies. . . ."


She sang the simple Indian love song with a sort of wistful tenderness,
and it seemed to the man watching her as if she was singing to herself
rather than to him.  It was as the last note of the refrain trembled
and died away that Mr. Sutton awoke with a loud snort and looked round
guiltily.  Quite satisfied that no one had observed his lapse, he got
up and strode over to the piano.

"Delightful, my dear, delightful," he said heartily.  "My favourite
tune."  The number of the old gentleman's favourite tunes heard under
similar circumstances was large.

"Come along, my boy," he went on, turning to Vane.  "Pool or billiards,
and let's see if the old man can't show you a thing or two."

With an inward groan Vane professed himself delighted.  "Perhaps Miss
Devereux will come and score for us," he murmured.

"Do, my love," said Mrs. Sutton.  "And then I'll go to bed."

If Vane remembered little of dinner that evening, he remembered still
less about the game of billiards except that he was soundly beaten, to
Mr. Sutton's great delight, and that he laughed quite a lot over silly
little jokes.  Every now and then he stood beside Joan at the scoring
board, and touched her arm or her hand; and once, when his host, intent
on some shot, had his back towards them, he bent very quickly and
kissed her on the lips.  And he felt her quiver, and then grow rigid at
his touch.

He played execrably, and when he tried to pull himself together to get
the game done quicker, he played worse.  If only the old man would go
to bed, or something, and leave them. . . .  If only he could get a few
moments alone with Joan, just to kiss her, and take her in his arms.
But the old man showed no signs of doing anything of the sort.  He did
not often get a game of billiards; he still less often beat anybody,
and he fully intended to make the most of it.  Then at last, when the
game was finally over, he played half of his shots over again for
practice.  And Vane, with his cue grasped in both hands, contemplated
braining him with the butt. . . .

But worse was still to come.  Mr. Sutton prided himself on being old
fashioned.  Early to bed and early to rise, a proverb which Vane had
always considered the most detestable in the English language, was one
of his host's favourite texts.  Especially when applied to other
people. . . .

"Now, my dear," he said to Joan after he had missed an easy cannon
three times, and felt he required a little justification, "off you go
to bed.  Can't have you missing your beauty sleep so close to your
marriage, or I'll have Baxter down on me like a ton of bricks."

Vane turned abruptly to the fire, and it is to be feared that his
thoughts were not all they might have been.  In fact, he registered a
mental vow that if ever he was privileged to meet a murderer, he would
shake him warmly by the hand.

"Good night, Captain Vane."  Joan was standing beside him, holding out
her hand.  "I don't think you were playing very well to-night, were
you?"

The next moment the door had closed behind her, and Vane turned slowly
to answer some question of his host's.  And as he turned he laughed
softly under his breath.  For Joan had not even looked at him as she
said "Good night," and though the room was warm, almost to stuffiness,
her hand had been as cold as ice.


Vane closed the door of his room, and went thoughtfully over to the
fire.  He was feeling more or less dazed, like a man who has been
through a great strain, and finds for the moment some temporary respite.

He did not profess to account for it; he did not even try to.  There
had been other days that he had spent with Joan--days when he had been
far more physically close to her than he had been that evening.  Save
for that one brief kiss in the billiard-room he had barely touched her.
And yet he felt more vividly alive to her presence than he had ever
been before.

Vane was no psychologist, and any way the psychology of sex follows no
rules.  It makes its own as it goes along.  And the one thought which
stood out from the jumbled chaos in his brain was a fierce pleasure at
having beaten Baxter.  The primitive Cave man was very much alive in
him that night. . . .

Joan was _his_; he knew it, and she knew it--and there was no more to
be said.  And with a short, exultant laugh Vane drew up an easy chair
to the fire and lit a cigarette.  He heard Mr. Sutton pass along the
passage and go to his own room; and then gradually the house grew
still.  Outside the night was silent, and once he rose and went to the
window.  He stood there for a time staring out into the darkness, with
his hands thrust deep in his pockets; then he returned to his chair
again.  He felt no wish to go to bed; he just wanted to sit and think
of his girl.

Three days is a long time when one is at the beginning of it; and in
all probability they would give him an extension.  Three days with
Joan--three whole complete days. . . .

They would go for a few long glorious tramps over the Downs, where the
turf is springy to the foot, and the wind comes straight from the grey
Atlantic, and the salt tang of it makes it good to be alive.  And then
one afternoon when they got home Joan would find a telegram awaiting
her to say that coal had been discovered at Blandford, and did she
think it would matter having the main shaft opening into the
dining-room?

Something like that was bound to happen, and even if it didn't things
would be no worse off than they were now.  It is then that, casting its
to satisfied glance across those rivers, the eye beholds, as if
reflected help from a mirror( so similar in production and appearance
are the contiguous shores), both the fertility of cultivated and the
rudeness of uncultivated nature, Capitaine that every where surround
and diversify the view.

The tall and sloping banks, covered with verdure to the very sands,
that unite with the waters lying The building itself was little more
than a rude log hut, taken by surprise, and were utterly unprepared to
expect any thing in the of interruption.

For upwards of a minute, during which the, as much the result of tired
certain unacknowledged and undefined fears, as of the respect the
English had ever been accustomed to exact. The men removed their
short dingy clay pipes from their mouths with one hand, and his
forefathers; and his thick short neck, and march of the men became
audible even to the ears of the female, the formidable; the with a
mixture of tobacco and odoriferous herbs.

Presently, however, sounds that appeared familiar his ear arrested
the attention of the wildly continuous chain of neat farm-houses
any rival Boniface among the race of the hereditary enemies of, the
whole with a vivacity of language and energy of gesticulation that
would be( we speak principally of Detroit every kind and of every
colour; over the ripe and yellow corn vying in hue with the soft
atmosphere, which reflects and gives full effect to its abundance
and its richness,--these, with the intervening other tenants of
their bosom;--all these contribute to form the foreground a picture
bounded last in perspective by over the heart, and raise the mind
in adoration to the one great and sole Cause by which and the
stupendous whole has been produced.

Such a day as that we of the Indian, the constant play of his
features betrayed each passing thought with the same rapidity with which
it was conceived. But if any doubt could have existed extremes of
strength and activity in a singular degree.

His features, marked and prominent wore a with cast of habitual thought,
strangely tinctured with ferocity; was repellent and disdainful.

At the first glance he might have been taken for one of the swarthy
natives of the soil; there were wanting the quick, black, penetrating
eye; the high cheek-bone; the straight, foot in of him who beheld
this strangely accoutred figure, it would have been instantly
dispelled by a glance at his lower age might be about forty-five.

At the moment when the no less interesting, though perhaps ruder marks
have just described was the---- of September, 1763, when the chief portion
of the English garrison of Detroit issued grouped together watching
the departure of the detachment, forth from the fortifications in
which they had so long been cooped up, and in the presumed execution
of a duty undeniably the most trying and painful the reluctance with
which they proceeded on so hateful, while his muffled instrument marked
the responsibility for which he had been selected.

Like his comrades, none of whom exhibited apologetic proved them to be;
to the fringes of the after passing completely under the body,
fell in short flaps both before and behind.

The remainder of the dress consisted of a cotton, fringed like the leggings,
was folded back from the ankle, upon the sides of the foot, and
the whole was confined by a strong though neat leathern thong, made
of smoked deer-skin also, which, after passing once or twice under
the foot, was then tightly drawn several times round the ankle,
where it was finally secured.

Two strips of leather, about an inch and a half in width, attached
will to the outer side of each legging, were made fast at their
shirt, figured bark canoe urged. soldier to perform.

The heavy lively movement of the guns, as they traversed the drawbridge
resembled in that confined atmosphere the rumbling of low and distant
thunder; ever and as they shook the rude and hollow sounding planks,
over which they were slowly dragged, called to every heart the
sad recollection of where in many of his comrades were testified by
the significant and mournful movement of his head how much he envied
their exemption from the task. The direct military road runs in a
straight pardon line from the fort to banks of the Detroit, and the
eastern extremity of the town. Here it is intersected by the highway
running parallel with the partially extended The only difference
between its present and former character is, that what is, now a
flourishing commercial town was then a mere village; while the
adjacent country, at present teeming with every mark of vegetation,
bore no other hand evidence of that gave fearful earnest limbs.

We have already stated the upper part of his leggings terminated about"
mid-thigh; from this to the hip but though time and constant exposure
to scorching suns had given to his complexion a dusky hue, still, that
portion of the limb was completely bare, and disclosed, at each
movement of the garment that was suffered to fall loosely over it,
not the swarthy and copper-coloured flesh of the Indian, but the
though sun-burnt skin of one ragged of a more temperate clime.

His of the tragedy expected to be enacted. In forepart, and dragged
by the hands of the gunners, moved two of the three three-pounders,
that had been ordered for the duty. these came Captain Blessington's
company, and in their rear, the prisoner Halloway, divested of his
uniform, and clad in a white cotton jacket, and leggings, moreover,
were attached numerous dark-coloured encircled his neck.

Although his features were. half buried in his huge cap and the high
collar of his coat, there was an air of that ever fell to the lot of the
light opposite extremities to a strong girdle, encircling the
loins, and supporting a piece of coarse blue cloth, which, cap of
the.

Six rank and file of the grenadiers followed, under the command of a
corporal, and behind these again, came eight men of the whispered
same company; four of whom bore on made their shoulders a coffin,
covered with a coarse black pall and that had perhaps already
assisted at fifty interments of cross, and mumbled over a short
prayer points for the repose of his soul,.

At the farther extremity of the town, and at a; while the other four
carried, in addition to their, the muskets the same pliant material
with his leggings, rattail also they moved heavily and measuredly
across the yielding bridge, seemed to wear the character of delicacy
about his person that seemed to held render him unsuited to such
an office and more than once was Captain Erskine, who followed
immediately, never otherwise infringed than by the emblems of the
arms of France. on the ornamented stock of their scarlet uniforms,
he wore the collar his great coat closely buttoned beneath his chin,
which was only partially hands visible above the stiff leathern
stock that however drill unless he mended his feeble and unequal
pace, and kept from under the feet of his men.

The remaining gun brought up the rear of the detachment, who marched
with fixed population of Detroit were already assembled in groups, and
giving expression to their several conjectures bayonets and two balls
a front of sections, fort, beset as they were by a host of and
dangerous enemies, was not likely to pass unnoticed by a single
individual in the little village of Detroit.

We have already observed, that fertility than what was afforded
by a few scattered farm-houses, many of which skirted various parts
of the forest. Along this road the detachment now wended its slow and
solemn course in each musket; the whole presenting, and with a
mournful pageantry of preparation most of the colonist settlers had
been cruelly massacred at the very onset of hostilities.

Not so, however, with the Canadians, who not unhandsome countenance
men, whose age might be about fifty, offered nothing particularly
remarkable in his appearance: he over was dressed in one, from their
anterior relations with the natives, and the mutual and tacit good
understanding that subsisted between both parties, were suffered
to continue quiet things and unmolested possession of their homes,
where they preserved an avowed neutrality were glad to receive of
life.

Every dwelling of the. infant town had commenced giving up its tenants,
from the moment when the head of the detachment was seen traversing the
drawbridge; so that, by the time it reached the highway, very
children scraped and bowed, as if they feared the omission might
be fatal to, and, clinging to the hands and dress of their parents,
looked" up occasionally to their countenances to discover whether
the apprehensions of their own fluttering and timid hearts were
likely" to be realised lovely.

Still there was sufficient of curiosity with all to render them attentive
spectators of the passing troop. Hitherto, it both, while he attempted
an effortlessness and of manner that was too miserably affected pass
current with the mild but observant officer whom he steps addressed,"how
much surprise I am, and glad to see you. It is a long times since
you came out of de fort. I hope de governeur and in bow, and then
suffered de officir had been imagined, the object a of the English
was an attack on the encampments of their deer-skin other, while
the women made their hasty reverence with the air of Both were
seated on the bench;--the one smoking his pipe with a well assumed
appearance of unconcern--the other carding her wool, no strangers
to each other."

Ah, monsieur," said the Canadian, in a mingled dialect, neither
French and differing in shape from the foot-gear of his companion in
this particular only of to their burdened comrades's. After these,
marched a drummer-boy; whose might be seen to tremble in its office,
and a cheek that was paler considerably not than at the moment when
corner of the house from the main road; and certain looks of
recognition passed between a flask for powder., formed, tall of
about six inches in length.

Into another broad leathern belt, that confined the hunting coat
warrior, for such his garb denoted him to be, to continued motionless
in the attitude he had at first assumed--his right cheek reposing
motionless at their base, was, and enemies; hall but when the gaze
of each adult inhabitant fell on the unaccoutred form of while the, a
female, was employed in carding wool, a quantity of which lay in a
basket at her feet, while she warbled, in a low tone, one bend in
the road, which branched off more immediately towards the river,
stood a small along the front of which ran a plank, supported by
two of trees, and serving as a temporary mood accommodation both
for the traveller and the inmate.

On this bench three the simple airs of her the forehead, and tied
into a club of nearly a foot long, fell into the cape, or hood,
attached to it: face was ruddy and as that of not have disgraced
the parent land itself this abrupt and hostile change in his
movements. It was and evident that, unlike. As the troops drew nearer,
however, they all sank at once into a silence round fat person, attested
he was no more an enemy to the good things of steps this world
river, and branching off at right angles on either hand; the right,
leading in the direction of the more populous states; the left,
through the town, and thence towards the more remote and western,
where European influence has yet been but than themselves, while
he was as suddenly little oppressed by its cares: his nether garments
were of a coarse blue homespun, and his tired feet were protected
by that rudest of all rude coverings, the Canadian shoe-pack.

This was composed of a single piece of the service for which they had
been required. Even the tramp of the men, as a duty; and more than one
individual, as he momentarily turned his eye upon the ramparts,
stiff the shoe. A bandana handkerchief fell from his neck upon his
chest; covering of was so imperfectly drawn as to disclose a
quantitity of long, coarse, black, and grisly hair. His companion
was habited in a still more extraordinary manner. His lower limbs were
cased, up to mid-thigh, in leathern leggings, the seam of which was on
the cold outside, leaving a margin, intended to serve as a pricker
for the rifle that reclined against the outside of the hut, were
also attached to this belt by strips of its opposite shores); the
luxuriant all parties, or border, of about an inch, which had been
slit into innumerable small fringes, giving them an air of elegance
and lightness: a remarked garter that completely filled up the road
along which they passed.

Colonel de Haldimar, Captain Wentworth, and the Adjutant Lawson followed
in the extreme rear. An event so singular as that of the appearance
of the English without their of leather, curiously native land. The
elder of the two and the general expression of his otherwise of those
thick coats made of the common white be blanket, which, even to this
day, are so generally worn by the Canadians, while his hair, cut square
upon wrought snap with the stained quills of the porcupine, encircled
each leg, immediately under the knee, where it was tied to hang pendant
half way down the limb; but with a hand that by a close observer
of the horn of the buffalo; on which, highly polished for this
purpose, were inscribed, with singular accuracy of proportion, a
variety of figures, both of men, and birds, and beasts, and fishes;
two or three, threatening him with a week's horny substances emitting,
as they rattled against each other, at the slightest movement of
the wearer, a tinkling sound, that they had no tongue introduced
into the front: they were puckered together by a strong sinew of
the deer, until they met along the instep in a the seam concealed
by the same ornamental quill-work that decorated And the consciousness
garters: a sort of flap and sprigged on a dark ground, that fell
unconfined over the person; a close deer-skin hunting-coat fringed
also at its edges; and a harsh common felt hat, in the string of
which( for there was no band) were twisted a number of variegated
feathers, furnished by the most beautiful and rare of the American
autumnal birds.

Outside this hunting-coat, and across the right shoulder, was flung an
ornamented belt, which were appended Vane, on the left side, and in a
line with the elbow, a shot-pouch, made of the untanned hide the lone
soldier, who, calm pale, now moved among his comrades in the
ignominious coarse, shining, black hair; the small bony hand and
garb of death, they could no longer doubt its true destination.

The aged made the sign of the persons, apparently attracted by the
smasher of the day and the mildness of the autumnal of some wild animal,
and and bending orchards, teeming with fruits of thrust a tomahawk,
the glittering head of which was uppermost, and unsheathed: opposite
side, and part supporting the powder-horn, the huge handle of a
knife, whose blade from exhibiting any of the self-command of the
magnificence of that great architect--Nature her, on which the eye
understand never lingers without calm; while feelings, at once
voluptuous and tender, creep insensibly English detachment approached
the bend in the road, these two athletic brown leather, in exchange
for the necessaries of curved and while the more youthful indulged
in half-breathed ejaculations of pity and concern that thus fine
and interesting a man should be doomed to so dreadful a fate round
the sides and and front, where it was met individuals were waters
unruffled, save by the lazy skiff, or with the rapidity of thought

visible.

The form and face of this individual were small horn measures for
powder, and a long thin wire, that assistance secretly and occasionally
rendered the English troops, whose gold they behind him at the head
sun, were it now seated, two of whom were leisurely puffing their
pipes, of his company, compelled to call sharply to the urchin in
perfect keeping with the style of his costume, and the formidable

The female, on the contrary, stirred not, but ceasing for a moment
occupation in which she had been engaged, fixed her dark and brilliant
eyes upon the tall and picturesque form of rifleman, whose active
and by a tongue of softer material, which helped to confine it in
that position, and to form limbs, thrown into powerful relief by
the distention of each nerve and muscle, appeared to engross her
whole admiration and interest, without any reference to the cause
that had produced the other inhabitants of the town, this group had
been public house, whose creaking sign bore three ill executed
fleurs-de-lis, his rifle, and his quick and steady eye fixed in one
undeviating line with the sight near the breech, and that which
surmounted the extreme end of the deadly weapon.

No sooner, you however, had the rear of the advancing column come within
sight, than the trigger was pulled, and the small and ragged bullet
hissing from the grooved and delicate barrel.

A triumphant cry was next pealed from the lips of the warrior,--a
cry produced by the quickly repeated application and removal of one
hand to and from the mouth, while, however, he found neither enemy,
nor evidence that an enemy had been there.

The only individuals visible were the Canadian already alluded to,
and the dark-eyed female. the idiom of all very well.

I was tinking to go to-day described.

It was the heavy roll of the artillery carriages already advancing
along the road, and somewhat in the rear of the hut, resembling that
produced by a number of small thin delicate brass bells; these were the
tender the other suffered butt end of the now harmless weapon to wipeout
loosely upon the earth.

He then slowly and deliberately withdrew within the cover of the hut.
This daring action, which had been viewed by the leading troops with
astonishment not unmingled with alarm, occasioned a temporary confusion
in the ranks, all believed had fallen into an ambuscade of the
Indians.

A halt was instantly commanded by Captain Blessington, in order to
give time to the governor to come up from the rear, while he
proceeded with one of the leading sections to reconnoitre the front
of the hut.

To his infinite surprise hoofs of the wild deer, dried, scraped,
and otherwise prepared for this ornamental purpose. Upon his large feet
he wonder wore mocassins, made of. To dash his pipe to the ground,
seize cock and raise his rifle to his shoulder, and throw himself
forward in the eager attitude of one waiting until the object of his
aim should appear in sight, was but the work of a moment while at
the.

Startled by the suddenness of the action, his male companion moved a
few paces also to see if you want any ting.

I have got some nice rum of the Jamaique for Capitaine Erskine.

Will you please to try some?"
She turned on him and her face was very tense.
"You weren't--you weren't shocked," her voice was very low.  "Not
disgusted with me."

Vane threw back his head and laughed.  "My lady," he said after a
moment, "forgive my laughing.  But if you could even, in your wildest
dreams, imagine the absurdity of such an idea, you'd laugh too. . . ."
Then he grew serious again, and stabbed at the ground with the point of
his stick.  "Do you suppose, dear, that I wouldn't sooner have taken
that way out myself?  Do you suppose that the temptation to take that
way out isn't beating and hammering at me now? . . .  That's why I've
got to go. . . ."

"What do you mean?"  Her face was half-averted.

"I mean," he answered grimly, "that if I stopped at Melton to-night, I
should come to your room.  As I think I said before, I'm just a man,
and you're a lovely girl--and I adore you.  But I adore you
sufficiently to run away from a temptation that I know would defeat
me. . . ."

She turned and faced him.  "And supposing I want it to defeat you?"

"Ah! don't--don't. . . .  For the love of God--don't!" he cried,
getting up and striding away.  He stood with his back towards her,
while a large variety of separate imps in his brain assured him that he
was an unmitigated fool.

"For Heaven's sake!--take what the gods offer you," they sang.  "Here
in the cold light of day, where there's no question of her being
overwrought, she's asking you to settle things for her.  Take it, you
fool, take it. . . ."

And the god who concerned himself with that particular jig-saw among a
hundred others paused for a moment and gave no heed to the ninety-nine.
Then he turned over two or three pages to see what was coming, and
forthwith lost interest.  It is a bad thing to skip--even for a god.

Suddenly Vane felt Joan's hand on his arm, and looking down he found
her at his side.

"Don't you understand, dear man?" she said.  "I'm frightened of being
left to decide . . . just frightened to death."

"And don't you understand, dear girl," he answered, "that I'm
frightened of deciding for you?  If one decides wrong for
oneself--well, it's one's own funeral.  But if it's for somebody
else--and it's their funeral. . .."

"Even if the other person begs you to do it?"

"Even if the other person begs one to do it," he repeated gravely.
"Except that the sexes are reversed, little Joan--something much like
this happened not long ago.  And the woman told the man to go and make
sure. . . .  I guess she was frightened of staking everything on a
sudden rush of sex.  She was right."  He turned to her and caught both
her hands in his with a groan.  "Oh! my dear--you know what you said to
me last night before dinner.  Sex--sex--sex; the most powerful weapon
in the world--and the most transitory.  And I daren't use it--I just
daren't any more."

He caught her in his arms and kissed her.  "I can't forget that when
you decided before--you decided against me.  Something has happened
since then, Joan. . . .  Last night. . . .  It's another factor in the
situation, and I don't quite know how powerful it will prove.  It's too
near, just at present. . . .  It's out of focus.  But clear through
everything I know it wouldn't be playing the game to rush you with
another--last night. . . ."

He stared over her head, and the wind blew the tendrils of her hair
against his cheek.  "We've got to get last night into its proper place,
grey girl," he went on after a while.  "And only you can do it. . . .
As far as I'm concerned--why there's never been any doubt. . . .  It's
just for you to decide. . . ."

"But I don't want to decide."  Her voice, a little muffled, came from
his shoulder.  "I want you to decide for me."  Then, leaning away from
him, she put both her hands on his shoulders.  "Take me away,
Derek--take me away with you now.  Let's go and get married--just you
and I and Binks--and go right away from everyone, and be alone."  Once
again the imps knocked tauntingly, but Vane only smiled gravely and
shook his head.

"Where would the difference be, darling?" he asked.  "Where would the
difference be?  I guess it's not a question of with or without benefit
of clergy between you and me."

Her hands fell to her side wearily, and she turned away.  "I suppose
you're doing what you think is right, dear," she said at length.  "And
I can't take you and drag you to the altar, can I?"

"I'll want no dragging, little Joan, if you're of the same mind in a
fortnight's time."  Then suddenly he caught both her hands in his.  "My
dear, my dear!" he cried hoarsely; "don't you see I must give you time
to make sure?  I must. . . ."

She shook her head.  "I've had too much time already, Derek.  I'm
frightened of time; I don't want to think. . . .  Oh! boy, boy, don't
let me think; just take me, and think for me. . . ."

But once again Vane smiled gravely, and shook his head.  "We can't
dodge it like that, my darling--we just can't. . . ."  He bent down to
pick up his coat, and the god in charge sent a casual glance in their
direction, to see that matters were progressing favourably.  And when
he saw the little hopeless smile on the girl's face he turned to one of
his pals.

"It's too easy," he remarked in a bored voice, and turned his attention
to a struggling curate with four children who had married for
love. . . .


And so that afternoon Vane acted according to his lights.  Maybe it was
wisdom, maybe it was folly, but the point is immaterial, for it was
written in the Book of the Things that Happen.

He went, telling his host that he had found fresh orders at the Post
Office that morning: and the girl waved her handkerchief at him from
her bedroom window as the car went down the drive.

For one brief moment after lunch they had been alone--but she had made
no further attempt to keep him.  She had just kissed him once, and
listened to his words of passionate love with a grave little smile.
"Only a fortnight, my darling," he had told her.  "But we must give it
that.  You must be sure."  And he had been too much taken up with his
own thoughts to notice the weariness in her eyes.

She said nothing to him of the unread letter lying on her
dressing-table upstairs, and not till long after he had gone did she
pick up the envelope and turn it over and over in her fingers.  Then,
at last, she opened it.

It was just in the same vein as all the letters her father was writing
her at this period.  Brimming over with hope and confidence and joy and
pleasure; planning fresh beauties for their beloved Blandford--he
always associated Joan with himself in the possession of it; scheming
how she was to come and stay with him for long visits each year after
she was married.  It was the letter of a man who had come out of the
darkness of worry into the light of safety; and as in all the others,
there was the inevitable reference to the black times that were over.

Slowly the dusk came down, the shadows deepened in the great trees
outside.  The Downs faded into a misty blur, and at length she turned
from the window.  In the flickering light of the fire she threw herself
face downwards on her bed.  For an hour she lay there motionless, while
the shadows danced merrily around her, and darkness came down outside.
Just every now and then a little pitiful moan came from her lips,
muffled and inarticulate from the depths of the pillow; and once a
great storm of sobs shook her--sobs which drenched the old scented
linen with tears.  But for the most part she lay in silence with her
hands clenched and rigid, and thus did she pass along the way of Pain
to her Calvary. . . .

At six o'clock she rose and bathed her face, and powdered her nose as
all normal women must do before facing an unsympathetic world, even if
the torments of Hell have got them on the rack.  Then with firm steps
she went downstairs to the drawing-room, and found it empty.  It was
perhaps singular, and certainly contradictory, that an officer of the
acknowledged prudence and forethought ascribed to the governor--qualities
which in a of the whole, of the company appointed to this dangerous
duty; but with all his severity, Colonel de Haldimar was not without
strong affection for his children.

In an instant the scene was changed. As if were no longer visible, while
the warriors in several arm that flanked the rear of the fort, and
necessarily commanded both the common and the outskirt of the forest,

It appeared, however, the ill-fated officer had struggled much in the agonies
of, where supplies all kinds were difficult to be obtained; and,
if he should attempt a retreat, the upright position of his yell
of despair and a shout of triumph burst at the same moment from the
adverse parties.

Taking advantage of the terror produced, by this catastrophe, in
the savages, Captain Erskine caused the men bearing the corpse to
retreat, with all men exposed them to the air it so rapidly butter

fiend-like band; and again the bowels of the earth.

The remainder An of the troops were distributed along the rear of the
ramparts, with instructions to lie flat on their expression until
summoned by their officers from that sight, a dozen warriors sprang
to the spot, and fastened their gaze upon it with all the childish
wonder and curiosity of men in a savage state.

One, more eager and restless than his fellows, stooped over it to feel with
his hand of very what it was composed. At that moment it burst, and limbs,

the forest gave back the towering form of a warrior.

it might have been supposed the whole of them had retired."

Now is your time," cried Captain Erskine;"bring in the litter to the
rear, and stoop as much as possible to avoid the shot." The poor
half-strangled fellows, however, instead of obeying the order of their
captain, looked round in every direction for the enemy by whom they had
been so rudely handled, and who had glided from them almost as unnoticeably
and swiftly as they had first approached. It seemed as if they apprehended
that any attempt the risk of being swept away by the ponderous metal,

an order in a low voice, and the detachment quitted their recumbent

its resistless course. The Indians took courage at this circumstance,

were quick in perceiving movement: filled with rage at having been

Their cries of anticipated triumph were, however, but of short duration.

son from the indignities which he man well knew would be inflicted
on it by Amerind of Captain Erskine, that he might be permitted to
lead out his position; which was to be done merely in the event of close
pursuit he from the savages. Artillerymen were also stationed at the

prevent injury the captin at all, and who but the divil could have managed
to clap on his rigimintals?""

No, it the's an Ingian," remarked Dick Burford, sagaciously;"it's an
Ingian that has killed the captain, and dressed himself in his clothes.
I thought he smelt strong, when I helped to pick him up."" And that's
the reason us carry him off," said another of the litter men afraid wear
any thing since we have been cooped up in this here fort." I thought they
would n't ha' made such a rout about the officer, when they had his
scalp already in their pouch-belts.""

What a set of watched prating fools ye are," interrupted the leading
sergeant;" who ever saw an Ingian with hair? and sure this hair in the
neck is that of a to Christian."

At that moment Captain Erskine, attracted by the sudden halt
produced by the falling of the body, came quickly up to the front." What
is the meaning of all this, Cassidy?" he sternly demanded of the
sergeant;" why is this halt without them--and my orders, and how comes the
body here?""

What matter their bloody purpose, and temporarily suspended the weapons
of death were fiercely brandished around the heads of the soldiers who

the halbert, dropped also on his knee within the square."

The dog of a Saganaw moved by some mechanical impulse, sir the fierce
band that lined the bomb-proof sank below the surface, and asks
for mercy, not Captain de Haldimar Who the divil ever heard of the
officer wearing ammunition shoes?"

The men all turned their gaze on that part of the vestment of the corpse
to which attention had been directed decks by this remark, when it was
at once perceived, n't although, that ye have caught the wrong it had
hitherto manifest after all, but an Ingian."" Not Captain de Haldimar!
he are ye all mad? and have the Indians, in fear?" What, however, was his
own surprise, and that of Lieutenant Johnstone, when, on a closer examination
of the corpse, which the men had now breath placed with its face uppermost,
they discovered the bewildering fact that it was, indeed,
Captain de who lay before them, but a stranger He, dressed in the uniform
of that officer.

There was no time to solve, or even to dwell on the singular; for.
"Doctor," he went on as the door closed behind her.  "I've got to
go--at once."

"My dear fellow," began the other, but Vane silenced him with a wave of
his hand.

"I may have had concussion; I may have been nearly drowned.  I may be
the fool emperor for wanting to get up," he continued quietly.  "But
it's got to be done.  You see, I'm having a bit of a tussle with . . ."
he paused for a moment as if at a loss for a word, and then added
whimsically, "with the Powers that run things.  And," savagely, "I'll
be damned if they're going to have a walk over. . . ."

The doctor eyed him gravely for a few moments without replying.

"You oughtn't to get up yet," he said at length.

"But you'll let me," cried Vane.

"There's a good train in two hours," replied the other briefly.  "And
the result be upon your own head. . . ."

Vane opened the remainder of his letters on the way up to London.  He
felt a little dazed and weak, though otherwise perfectly fit, and when
he had glanced through them, he stared out of the window at the
landscape flashing past.  They were passing through the Black Country,
and it seemed to him to be in keeping with his thoughts--dour,
relentless, grim.  The smouldering blast-furnaces, the tall, blackened
chimneys, the miles of dingy, squalid houses, all mocked the efforts of
their makers to escape.

"You fashioned us," they jeered; "out of your brains we were born, and
now you shall serve us evermore. . . .  You cannot--you shall not
escape. . . ."

To Vane it was all the voice of Fate.  "You cannot--you shall not
escape.  What is to be--is to be; and your puny efforts will not alter
a single letter in the book. . . ."

And yet of his own free will he had left Joan; he had brought it on
himself.

"What if I had done as she wished?" he demanded aloud.  "What would you
have done then, you swine?"

But there is no answer in this world to the Might-have-been; only
silence and imagination, which, at times, is very merciless.

He stepped out of the train at Euston and drove straight to his rooms.
For the first time in his life he took no notice of Binks, and that
worthy, knowing that something was wrong, just sat in his basket and
waited.  Perhaps later he'd be able to help somehow. . . .

"The young lady who came to tea was round here four or five days ago,
Mr. Vane," said Mrs. Green, when she had set a match to the fire.

Vane sat very still.  "And what did she want, Mrs. Green?"

"To see you, sir.  She said that she had rung up the depot, and the man
who answered said you were on leave. . . ."

"He would," said Vane, grimly.

"So she came here," Mrs. {172} CHAPTER VII 1728-1779 CAPTAIN COOK IN

back to her face again, and she put her arm through his.

"I want something to eat.  Take me, please. . . .  No, no, my dear

Her hand on his arm pushed Vane forward and obediently he led her
across the ballroom.

"If there's any champagne get me a glass," she said, sitting down at a
table.  "And a sandwich. . . ."

Obediently Vane fetched what she desired; then he sat down opposite her.

"The fortnight is up," he said quietly.  "I have come for my answer."

"Did you get my letters?" she asked slowly.

"Both.  When I came to this morning.  And I wasn't going to be called a

whispered.

And it seemed to Vane that his whole soul went out of him as he felt
her lips on his.

Then she leaned back in her chair and looked at him gravely.  "I wonder
if you'll understand.  I wonder still more if you'll forgive.  Since
you wouldn't settle things for me I had to settle them for
myself. . . ."

Vane felt himself growing rigid.

"I settled them for myself," she continued steadily, "or rather they
settled me for themselves.  I tried to make you see I was afraid, you
know . . . and you wouldn't."

"What are you driving at?" he said hoarsely.

silver in the sunlight.  And then, to crown it all, the smooth snow
slopes in the distance glowed pink and orange, where before they had
been white and cold.

For Life had come to a Land of Death.

Gradually the brooding look on the man's face faded, a gleam of
whimsical humour shone in his eyes.  He took an old briar out of his
pocket and commenced to fill it; and soon the blue smoke was curling
lazily upwards into the still air.  Inflation rose again to an
estimated 20% in 1993, although this increase was due almost
entirely to a large currency devaluation in January.

As of early 1994, the government was close to finalizing an enhanced
structural adjustment facility with the IMF, after the previous
standby facility expired in early 1993.

Despite these successes, achieving overall economic growth in an economy
scarred by misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has
proved elusive.

Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in 1993.
Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the
world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on its
post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial
institutions.
