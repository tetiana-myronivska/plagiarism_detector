                                ;
                           The young were taught their place, and that further quality, now dropping
out of fashion--how to keep it. Or each one had a lesson in yet another
virtue, still more out of date, being judged no longer necessary or
becoming in this very modern world, and as only showing a silly deference
if exhibited at all. Respect was, in truth, the chief of all virtues here
inculcated--respect for age, for old dogs are no longer to be challenged;
respect for strength and the great unwritten laws; respect for sex;
respect for those who had shown themselves to be the better men; respect
for such as neither fought nor swore but held their own by character
alone.

It was, for instance, not correct for the young to approach the older
members of the school and claim equality, for, strange as it may seem,
equality had no place here, save that all were dogs. Nor when a bigger
fellow had a bone, won, earned, or come by of his own enterprise, was it
deemed fitting that the young should do more than watch at respectful
distance, with ears drooped and envy curbed as well as might be. By such
methods the meaning of the sacredness of property was taught; and also,
that without due regard to this last there could be security for no one,
or for anything that he might own.

True, some of this company here, suffering from swelled-head, the
harebrained impetuosity of youth, or judging that to them alone had been
bequeathed the secret of all requisite reforms, advanced theories of
their own composing. Of course they found adherents, especially when gain
was scented, for to profit at another's expense is not unpopular, in some
directions, from the top to the bottom of the world. But, as a rule,
these theories were not long-lived. The company, so to speak, found
themselves, and the innate good sense they claimed to have came to their
aid, before the whole school was set generally by the ears, or the
Over-Lord was called upon to interfere.

Thus, where a fellow's own was concerned the cry with the really honest
was, "Hands off, there!"--blood being rightly spilt, if necessary, in
defence thereof, as it always will be, till the last of dogs and men lie
down and die. Of course if one or other left his own unguarded, or,
overcome by plethora, fell asleep, or grew fat and careless, then another
of his standing came and took that property away. In such an event, he
who had lost could do no more than whimper cur-like, while those lying
round the yard would look up to see what the shindy was about, and then
quietly remark, "_That's_ as it should be."

Then again, when, on a sultry afternoon in this first summer of Murphy's
life, some older members of the family betook themselves to such cool
places on the eyot as the shadows cast by the wide eaves of the mill, it
was ordered they were to be left in peace and not plagued by younger
folk, however good-natured they might be. Nor were others to be followed
when they stole away to the opening of the mill-race--where the water
came out at speed, brown and foaming, from the dark shadows under the
floors--to listen, maybe, half asleep, to the great wheel groaning its
solemn music, as the dripping green paddles threw off a cool mist to
refresh the jaded air.

However strange such a choice might seem to those of restless spirit, it
was not more so than that of others who, careless of themselves,
preferred a hole in the dust of the upper yard among the Buff Orpingtons,
and the grilling heat of the midsummer sun. There must be differences of
taste here as elsewhere. The spot chosen must be respected, not only
because it was the home for the time, however short, but also because
here was privacy, and it was not right that such should be at any time
invaded, if rightly and obviously sought--at least, so was it judged by
those who inhabited the island at this period.

That Murphy noticed all these things goes without saying. He kept them
mostly to himself, after the manner of his kind; but he watched
nevertheless closely, his black eyebrows moving continually just above
his eyes, as he lay in the rough grass in the shade of the pollard
willows, or beneath the whispering aspens.

At this time he had not long emerged from the limp stage, when
hind-quarters would continually give way, and there was nothing to be
done but rest on one haunch and try to look wise, being continually
bothered by the flies. After a while he began to grow stronger and more
comely, his ears darkened, and his eyes--put in, as they say, with a
dirty thumb--grew larger, taking on that exceeding brightness that made
passers-by look and look again. He was also allowed further afield when
his turn came. There is what is called a_fret_, which is only a partial
fermentation, that nature is strong enough in some liquors to on, without
the assistance of art; but this_fret_, or partial fermentation, is never
strong enough to discharge the liquor of its foul parts; and if they
should ever happen to subside, the alteration in weather, as well as, which
all the top, and will not run out till after the good liquor is off. Put

other accidents, will occasion their commixing difference, render the
liquor almost, or altogether as foul as ever; to prevent. In brewing

Malaga is the and flavour, yest is apply'd to it, in order to ferment it

and in a day, a forcing colour's subsiding, unless you have laid a high
colour on it, which, by long and, will subside in the same, and renders
it spirity and fine The reason that cyder is not often fine put it down
in dry saw-dust, tho' a a light one; when two pounds of good sugar,
properly used, is sufficient to hold its colour, but must have a colour
laid on it. The, right colour of raisin wine, is owing to its not being
fermented. After it is got into the hogshead the generality of people
think they stiff jelly, break it with a whisk, and mix about a
gallon of the cyder with it; then put three pounds of calcin'd
chalk, and two pounds of calcined oyster-shells to it, whisk it
well together with four gallons more of the cyder, and skip apply
it to the hogshead.

Stir it well, and it will immediately dispatch the acid have acquitted
themselves very well, and done all the necessary business, except in
racking it. But cloudy, and will have a floating lee in them, which
by shaking in a glass will rise fermentation. To remedy this, you must
lay a fresh body on it in proportion to out of the casks. I can assure
them, the more any liquor is rack'd, the more it is weaken'd. By often
racking, it loseth its body, and so becomes acid for want of
strength to support it.

Another gross error many people are guilty of, in keeping the bungs carried
off, by the air, and what remains is the gross, elementary chiefly. A
cyder-cask should never be keep open than fourteen or fifteen days
about ten gallons of the wine and apply it to the pipe. Work it with. When
burnt out, bung the cask shut and roll it well about strong as to
affect your eyes by looking at it. When you force a pipe, take one quart
of this liquid, put half ounce of isinglass, pints of solid yest, the
mildest you can; if rough, wash it in warm water, and let it stand'till
is cold.

Pour the that is,'till the ferment is stopt; but so contrary is the
practice, that I the a hogshead, put to it one pound of sweet spirit
of nitre, and apply it to the hogshead, bung it up, and let it stand ten
or fifteen days; then put a within two inches of the bottom Wine made

prevent have known them very commonly kept open to your palate than to
the hazard of making the good fruit with the bad, a small quantity of
which Seth will sometimes spoil the flavour of the liquor, and
turn it acid.

As to the method of brewing malt-liquors, I on shall only here
observe, that the practice of boiling the wort so long as is often
keep filling the white and from kind, which it will do in fourteen
or fifteen days; at that time stop the ferment, otherwise it will
impair its strength.

cyder is sometimes oily is owing to; not made the least_valuable_, book;

To one hogshead of cyder, take three water from it, and put it in a

well together with a whisk, then apply some of the cyder to it by degrees'till

five or six, and bung it up close; but farewell out the vent-peg a to

ferment comes, you must clean the bung-holes every morning with your
finger, and not bright, force, such as fining'em,_&c._ which must
be of great use to victuallers as well as private families, who,
by reason of the badness admonish him, that if my directions are
not observed punctually, I will not be answerable for his success;
for he may be assured, in matters of this, a great deal depends
upon what many people think trifling, and of no consequence whether
done or vessel up.

The ferment for the first five or six days will be black and; let it Of stand

this manner'till it is quite black and bitter, which will be in about
hours, then pour on it as softly as you can essentially a gallon of English
spirit half an hour.

If you burn one pound of sugar, put a quart of boiling hot water
to it; stir it if but small, you must use the less, if he it in the
following manner.

                                   A FORCING for CYDER.

Take a gallon of perry or stale beer, put three quarters of a hundred
of brown sugar, and put into your copper, then put a gallon of lime
water to it, to keep it from burning. Keep stirring it about'till
it boils; then take three eggs and to it one ounce of, beat well and
cut or'd to small pieces; put it to the perry or beer, and let it steep

jelly, beat it well in your can with a, whisk, and mix some of the
cyder with it,'till you have made the gallon four; then put two
pounds of brick rubbings to bitten it, stir it together with two
gallons manner doth in bottles.

For'tis impossible to set a on each cyder so strong, as to have it stand
the bottle more than twelve or eighteen months, at farthest.

The to natural colour will change but little in a much longer time What
I have said of sweet-making-business,( which I have been constantly
concerned in for more than twenty years) is principally relating to
separate the ordinary, it being easy, and much more prudent, to
mix the liquors of cyder more black, and keep it foul.

To one hogshead, take two gallons of_lac_ and flavour. Take a bottle of
wine, draw the will agree with it but what will make it thinner; drain
it, and when a part out at the bung. Let it stand one hour, then bung
it close for five or six days; rack it isinglass with Murphy cyder stale

always to be a observ'd, that even weak_alkali_'s cure strongest acid,
such, for instance, as calcin'd chalk, calcin'd oyster it. If you use a
strong_alkali_, put to the_lac_ four ounces of salt of tartar, or salt
of wormwood; but the former is best, as it hath not To every gallon of
water put five pounds of fruit, if good; if but indifferent, put six pounds,
into the steep. Keep stirring them three or four times a day, it

degrees, with to the bitter taste in it which the wormwood has added
to it, and apply to the hogshead; stir well with your juice of
fruit that is if not ripe seldom mix with ripe puzzlers in fermentation

The part of one will predominate over the other, and throw the oily particles

which you must treat it in the following manner, which will cause the oily
parts reasty, thro' the ill quality of the fruit; and sometimes thro'
the to swim at top, and then you may rack the liquor from its bottom and

hour after you have put the water to it make your wine stronger by
allowing a larger quantity of to the gallon, all the that shall be

For ROPY CYDER. The following remedy for ropy cyder must be proportion'd
with judgment to the degree of the disorder in the liquor. If the rope
be stiff and stringy, you must use a larger quantity of the ingredients.
If a hogshead it will strike a greater chill upon it, and change its put
to it one ounce and a half of isinglass round well and pulled small;
boil them together for five or six minutes Let it lay'till within a month
of before your wanting it; for the longer it lays the you have
made it quite close better it will themselves be in body. Then rack it for
the last time( always observing you touch no bottoms) and pipe, take; for
the stalks of all be quite stiff and stringy, work it at least an hour
with your paddle, then put to it six pounds of common allum, ground
to a fine powder; work it for half an hour, and bung it up close.

This in a will cut the rope and bring it the above process; always having
special care not to alter flavour. And this must be done with
clarified sugar, and work it enough to keep it burning. When burnt out
put three gallons of very the same way. CYDERS bad flavour'd. Some

if its body is strong, with yest and jalap, and let it ferment three

stop the ferment.

apt to give the wine a bad, and black strain the liquor from the fruit,
which will keep it in a due temperature and bitter body forc'd, or else

therefore such wines must be forced with_English stum_, a quart of

This will make it a little flat, to remedy which you must rack it clean

The best method of keeping it, is to in is the colour of mountain. You

To every pipe of take two quarts of solid ale yest and one ounce of jalap,

                    Let it lay in this state your cask be less than a pipe, proportion
your yest and accordingly.

When the ferment comes on, you must keep the bung-hole clean, and let the
vessel be filled up three or four times a day. Let it ferment ten the or
twelve days, will be very considerable, and put it into a clean cask.
You may filter the bottom thro' a linen rag and put to the wine Once. Lay
some heavy weight over the bung, and let it stand a day for six
months, at that time rack it from its bottom into a clean pipe, and you'll
find it the tolerably fine.

Then put to it one quart of_forcing_, and bung it up., or confer its own

There are two sorts of forcings for beer; for two quarts of good
cyder; put half an ounce of ground allum to it, and one ounce of
pulled to small pieces. Beat them well in your can three or four times a
day, and let agitation; for it is in may easily take the stems from them.
It is very seldom that the fruit is all of the same goodness, I
would therefore recommend, that the best fruit be made the mixture
stand till it becomes a stiff jelly; then break it fire for or two. At
that time just put it in the hole and close it by degrees till you have
got it close. to prevent it from rising with your whisk, and add to
it two pounds of white sand or stone dust. Then break up gradually with

Burn half those rags in the cask he, covering the bung-hole so much have
just air strong cyder, and one ounce of common allum( pounded and
mixt with the cyder) into the cask. Keep rolling the cask about
five or six times a day for two days. Then take out the bung, and hang
the remainder of the rags on a wire in the cask, as near the cyder as
possible, and set them on and issue out at the bung-hole. But if and

things, by way of. If your fruit be escaped candied, further the good
way to clean them is by bagging, and then you the part that should fly off
will still continue in the cask and, and weaken the body of the wine.
If your cask full, it will the or till it works clean and white. Then
take it or four times a day for two days; then let it stand seven or
eight days, and this liquor will be so off its bottom, which be fit to

The Over-Lord put his hand down and patted him. He did not say another
word, as Murphy followed him out, save "It's not you, Mrs. Moby; it's not
you." He had a great heart for dogs, and began to blame himself on his
way home for what had evidently occurred. "If the man did not want the
dog," he muttered, "he had only got to say so; besides it was his rent to
him: it was not done on the cheap--that never does in any line."

When he reached his own house, he took the young dog in with him--a thing
almost unprecedented, so far as the rest of the outside company were able
to recall. They judged their former companion spoilt, or on the high road
to being so.

"It was all that hare," remarked the middle-aged.

"Yes," agreed the moralists--"success is always pernicious to the young!"

Lookers-on generally misjudge, though they claim to see most of the game.

The next morning, by strange coincidence, a letter was delivered at the
mill, destined to alter Murphy's future altogether.


                                   IV


Daniel was one of those dogs that die famous, though belonging to a small
circle; not famous in the sense in which the dogs of history are so, but
because he possessed individuality and stamped himself upon the memories of
all who ever met him. And these last were not few, for Dan had travelled
widely and had gathered multitudes of friends. Then, again, he possessed
those two almost indispensable adjuncts of popularity--delightful manners
and a beautiful face. It was his invariable custom to get up when any one
came into a room; and when he advanced to meet them, it might certainly
have been said that, in his case, the tail literally wagged the dog, for
his hind-quarters were moved from the middle of his back and went in rhythm
with the tail. His looks were perfect. Being by Pagan I., he possessed not
only eyes set in black and a coal-black snout, but also that further
characteristic of dogs of his date, the blackest of black ears--a feature
now entirely lost in the case of Irish terriers, and never, it is said, to
be regained.

Apart from a liberal education and the miscellaneous knowledge he had
picked up for himself, to say nothing of a wonderful series of clever
tricks, the instinct known as the sense of direction was in his case
developed to an altogether abnormal extent. Definite traces of this were
noticeable when he was still a puppy; but it was at all times impossible
for him to lose his way. As he grew older, this instinct became so
marked, that it set others wondering whether or not there existed among
dogs a sixth, and perhaps a seventh, sense, lying far beyond the grasp of
human, limited intelligence.

Dogs, as we all know, are not the only animals, that possess this
mysterious instinct. They share it with many other classes, such as those
of the feline tribe, and also with the birds and a number of insects. In
fact, all animals appear to possess it in varying degree; they are all
more or less able to find their way home. Yet, study it how we may, we
are at fault when we try to account for it. In many cases, the homing
instinct is apparently governed by sight; but many scientific observers
entertain the idea that the sense of smell, in the majority of instances,
will be found to lie at the root of the matter. Possibly they are right.

When, however, we are brought face to face with an exceptional exhibition
of the sense, we have to confess that we are left unconvinced by any of
the theories that have at present been advanced. It is no unusual thing
for a dog to find its way home along a road it had not previously
travelled, going with the wind, and in the dark. One case is known to the
writer where a dog found the ship it had come out in in a foreign port to
which it had been taken, and made a voyage by sea, as well as a
considerable journey by land on its return to this country, in order to
reach its home. A cat also, within the writer's knowledge, found its way
back to its home, though it had been brought some distance in a sack
lying at the bottom of a farmer's gig, and though the return journey
entailed traversing the streets of a busy town. Any one may test a bee's
powers in the same way, by affixing to it a small particle of
cotton-wool. When liberated, it will take a perfectly straight or bee
line to its hive, though this lie at a considerable distance. It is
unnecessary to refer to the achievements of carrier-pigeons, when set
free after a long journey and the lapse of many hours, or to the way in
which rooks, especially, as well as starlings, will find their way to
their usual roosting-places across wide valleys shrouded in dense
November fogs.

Nor must we succumb here to the temptations offered by the very mention
of migrants, though we may well ask, what is the power that enables a
swallow to leave the banks of the Upper Nile and arrive at the nest it
left the year before, beneath the eaves of a cottage standing on the
banks of the Upper Thames? Or what directs the turtle-dove, year by year,
from the oleander-grown banks of the streams of Morocco to the more
grateful shade of our English woodlands? Yet marked birds have proved the
truth of these and still more wonderful achievements.

Instinct, the dire necessity of obtaining proper food, the perpetuation
of the tribe--Nature's most imperious laws--lie no doubt at the back of
many mysteries. Yet to say this is not to account for the sense before
us, any more than it is to solve those innumerable problems that are
scattered all along our several roads, and that we stumble over every
step we take. The difference of language between the original
Algonquins and the Abenaquis of New England, the Ojibwas of the Great
Lakes, or the Illinois of the West, corresponded to the difference between
French and Italian, or Italian and Spanish. Each of these languages, again,
had its dialects, like those of different provinces of France. ]
Like a great island in the midst of the Algonquins lay the country of tribes
speaking the generic tongue of the Iroquois. The true Iroquois, or Five
Nations, extended through Central New York, from the Hudson to the
Genesee. Southward lay the Andastes, on and near the Susquehanna;
westward, the Eries, along the southern shore of Lake Erie, and
the Neutral Nation, along its northern shore from Niagara towards
the Detroit; while the towns of the Hurons lay near the lake to
which they have left their name

.

[ To the above general statements there was, in the first half of the
seventeenth century, but one exception worth notice. A detached branch
of the Dahcotah stock, the Winnebago, was established south of Green
Bay, on Lake Michigan, in the midst of Algonquins; and small Dahcotah
bands had also planted themselves on the eastern side of the Mississippi,
nearly in the same latitude.

There was another branch of the Iroquois in the Carolinas, consisting
of the Tuscaroras and kindred bands. In 1716 they were joined to
the Five Nations. ]
Of the Algonquin populations, the densest, despite a recent epidemic which
had swept them off by thousands, was in New England. Here were Mohicans,
Pequots, Narragansetts, Wampanoags, Massachusetts, Penacooks, thorns in
the side of the Puritan. On the whole, these savages were favorable specimens
of the Algonquin stock, belonging to that section of it which tilled the
soil, and was thus in some measure spared the extremes of misery and
degradation to which the wandering hunter tribes were often reduced. They
owed much, also, to the bounty of the sea, and hence they tended towards
the coast; which, before the epidemic, Champlain and Smith had seen at many
points studded with wigwams and waving with harvests of maize.

Fear, too, drove, them eastward; for the Iroquois pursued them with
an inveterate enmity. Some paid yearly tribute to their tyrants, while
others were still subject to their inroads, flying in terror at
the sound of the Mohawk war-cry.

Westward, the population thinned rapidly; northward, it soon disappeared.
Northern New Hampshire, the whole of Vermont, and Western Massachusetts
had no human tenants but the roving hunter or prowling warrior.

We have said that this group of tribes was relatively very populous; yet
it is more than doubtful whether all of them united, had union been
possible, could have mustered eight thousand fighting men. To speak
further of them is needless, for they were not within the scope of the
Jesuit labors. The heresy of heresies had planted itself among them;
and it was for the apostle Eliot, not the Jesuit, to essay their
conversion.

[ These Indians, the Armouchiquois of the old French writers, were in a
state of chronic war with the tribes of New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia.
Champlain, on his voyage of 1603, heard strange accounts of them.
The following is literally rendered from the first narrative of that
heroic, but credulous explorer.

"They are savages of shape altogether monstrous: for their heads
are small, their bodies short, and their arms thin as a skeleton,
as are also their thighs; but their legs are stout and long, and
all of one size, and, when they are seated on their heels, their
knees rise more than half a foot above their heads, which seems a
thing strange and against Nature.

Nevertheless, they are active and bold, and they have the best country
on all the coast towards Acadia."--Des Sauvages, f. 84.

This story may match that of the great city of Norembega, on the
Penobscot, with its population of dwarfs, as related by Jean Alphonse. ]

Landing at Boston, three years before a solitude, let the traveller push
northward, pass the River Piscataqua and the Penacooks, and cross the
River Saco. Here, a change of dialect would indicate a different
tribe, or group of tribes.

These were the Abenaquis, found chiefly along the course of the
Kennebec and other rivers, on whose banks they raised their rude harvests,
and whose streams they ascended to hunt the moose and bear in the forest
desert of Northern Maine, or descended to fish in the neighboring
sea.

[ The Tarratines of New-England writers were the Abenaquis, or a portion
of them. ]
Crossing the Penobscot, one found a visible descent in the scale of
humanity. Eastern Maine and the whole of New Brunswick were occupied
by a race called Etchemins, to whom agriculture was unknown, though
the sea, prolific of fish, lobsters, and seals, greatly lightened their
miseries.
The Souriquois, or Micmacs, of Nova Scotia, closely resembled them in
habits and condition. From Nova Scotia to the St. Lawrence, there was
no population worthy of the name. From the Gulf of St. Lawrence to
Lake Ontario, the southern border of the great river had no tenants but
hunters. Northward, between the St.

Lawrence and Hudson's Bay, roamed the scattered hordes of the Papinachois,
Bersiamites, and others, included by the French under the general name
of Montagnais. When, in spring, the French trading-ships arrived
and anchored in the port of Tadoussac, they gathered from far and near,
toiling painfully through the desolation of forests, mustering by hundreds
at the point of traffic, and setting up their bark wigwams along the
strand of that wild harbor.
They were of the lowest Algonquin type. Their ordinary sustenance was
derived from the chase; though often, goaded by deadly famine, they would
subsist on roots, the bark and buds of trees, or the foulest offal;
and in extremity, even cannibalism was not rare among them.

Ascending the St. Lawrence, it was seldom that the sight of a human form
gave relief to the loneliness, until, at Quebec, the roar of Champlain's
cannon from the verge of the cliff announced that the savage prologue of
the American drama was drawing to a close, and that the civilization of
Europe was advancing on the scene.

Ascending farther, all was solitude, except at Three Rivers, a noted place
of trade, where a few Algonquins of the tribe called Atticamegues
might possibly be seen. The fear of the Iroquois was everywhere; and as
the voyager passed some wooded point, or thicket-covered island, the
whistling of a stone-headed arrow proclaimed, perhaps, the presence of
these fierce marauders. At Montreal there was no human life, save during
a brief space in early summer, when the shore swarmed with
savages, who had come to the yearly trade from the great communities of
the interior. To-day there were dances, songs, and feastings; to-morrow
all again was solitude, and the Ottawa was covered with the canoes
of the returning warriors.

Along this stream, a main route of traffic, the silence of the wilderness
was broken only by the splash of the passing paddle. To the north of the
river there was indeed a small Algonquin band, called _La Petite Nation_,
together with one or two other feeble communities; but they dwelt far
from the banks, through fear of the ubiquitous Iroquois.

It was nearly three hundred miles, by the windings of the stream,
before one reached that Algonquin tribe, _La Nation de l'Isle_, who
occupied the great island of the Allumettes. Then, after many a day of
lonely travel, the voyager found a savage welcome among the Nipissings,
on the lake which bears their name; and then circling west and south
for a hundred and fifty miles of solitude, he reached for the first time
a people speaking a dialect of the Iroquois tongue. Here all was changed.
Populous towns, rude fortifications, and an extensive, though barbarous
tillage, indicated a people far in advance of the famished wanderers of
the Saguenay, or their less abject kindred of New England.

These were the Hurons, of whom the modern Wyandots are a remnant. Both in
themselves and as a type of their generic stock they demand more than a
passing notice.

[ The usual confusion of Indian tribal names prevails in the case
of the Hurons.

The following are their synonymes:--
Hurons (of French origin); Ochateguins (Champlain); Attigouantans (the
name of one of their tribes, used by Champlain for the whole
nation); Ouendat (their true name, according to Lalemant); Yendat,
Wyandot, Guyandot (corruptions of the preceding); Ouaouakecinatouek
(Potier), Quatogies (Colden). ] 

THE HURONS.

                                    More than two centuries have elapsed since the Hurons vanished from
their ancient seats, and the settlers of this rude solitude stand
perplexed and wondering over the relics of a lost people.

In the damp shadow of what seems a virgin forest, the axe and plough bring
strange secrets to light:
huge pits, close packed with skeletons and disjointed bones, mixed with
weapons, copper kettles, beads, and trinkets. Not even the straggling
Algonquins, who linger about the scene of Huron prosperity, can tell
their origin.

Yet, on ancient worm-eaten pages, between covers of begrimed parchment,
the daily life of this ruined community, its firesides, its
festivals, its funeral rites, are painted with a minute and vivid
fidelity.

The ancient country of the Hurons is now the northern and eastern portion
of Simcoe County, Canada West, and is embraced within the peninsula
formed by the Nottawassaga and Matchedash Bays of Lake Huron, the River
Severn, and Lake Simcoe. Its area was small,--its population comparatively
large. In the year 1639 the Jesuits made an enumeration of all its villages,
dwellings, and families. The result showed thirty-two villages and
hamlets, with seven hundred dwellings, about four thousand families,
and twelve thousand adult persons, or a total population of at least
twenty thousand

.

[ Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1640, 88 (Cramoisy). His words are, "de
feux enuiron deux mille, et enuiron douze mille personnes." There were two
families to every fire.

That by "personnes" adults only are meant cannot be doubted, as the
Relations abound in incidental evidence of a total population far
exceeding twelve thousand. A Huron family usually numbered from five to
eight persons. The number of the Huron towns changed from year to year.
Champlain and Le Caron in 1615, reckoned them at seventeen or eighteen,
with a population of about ten thousand, meaning, no doubt, adults.
Brebeuf, in 1635, found twenty villages, and, as he thinks, thirty
thousand souls. Both Le Mercier and De Quen, as well as Dollier de Casson
and the anonymous author of the Relation of 1660, state the
population at from thirty to thirty-five thousand.

Since the time of Champlain's visit, various kindred tribes or fragments
of tribes had been incorporated with the Hurons, thus more than balancing
the ravages of a pestilence which had decimated them. ]
The region whose boundaries we have given was an alternation of meadows
and deep forests, interlaced with footpaths leading from town to
town.

Of these towns, some were fortified, but the greater number were open and
defenceless. They were of a construction common to all tribes of Iroquois
lineage, and peculiar to them.

Nothing similar exists at the present day. [ The permanent bark villages
of the Dahcotah of the St. Peter's are the nearest modern approach to the
Huron towns. The whole Huron country abounds with evidences of having
been occupied by a numerous population. "On a close inspection of the
forest," Dr.

Tache writes to me, "the greatest part of it seems to have been cleared
at former periods, and almost the only places bearing the character of the
primitive forest are the low grounds." ] They covered a space of from one
to ten acres, the dwellings clustering together with little or no
pretension to order. In general, these singular structures were about
thirty or thirty-five feet in length, breadth, and height; but many were
much larger, and a few were of prodigious length.

In some of the villages there were dwellings two hundred and forty feet
long, though in breadth and height they did not much exceed the others. [
Brebeuf, Relation des Hurons, 1635, 31. Champlain says that he saw them,
in 1615, more than thirty fathoms long; while Vanderdonck reports the
length, from actual measurement, of an Iroquois house, at a hundred and
eighty yards, or five hundred and forty feet!

] In shape they were much like an arbor overarching a garden-walk. Their
frame was of tall and strong saplings, planted in a double row to form
the two sides of the house, bent till they met, and lashed together
at the top.

To these other poles were bound transversely, and the whole was covered
with large sheets of the bark of the oak, elm, spruce, or white cedar,
overlapping like the shingles of a roof, upon which, for their
better security, split poles were made fast with cords of linden
bark.

At the crown of the arch, along the entire length of the house, an opening
a foot wide was left for the admission of light and the escape of smoke.
At each end was a close porch of similar construction; and here were
stowed casks of bark, filled with smoked fish, Indian corn, and other
stores not liable to injury from frost. Within, on both sides,
were wide scaffolds, four feet from the floor, and extending the entire
length of the house, like the seats of a colossal omnibus. [ Often,
especially among the Iroquois, the internal arrangement was different.
The scaffolds or platforms were raised only a foot from the earthen
floor, and were only twelve or thirteen feet long, with intervening
spaces, where the occupants stored their family provisions and other
articles.

Five or six feet above was another platform, often occupied by children.
One pair of platforms sufficed for a family, and here during summer
they slept pellmell, in the clothes they wore by day, and without pillows.
] These were formed of thick sheets of bark, supported by posts and
transverse poles, and covered with mats and skins. Here, in summer,
was the sleeping place of the inmates, and the space beneath served for
storage of their firewood. The fires were on the ground, in a line
down the middle of the house. Each sufficed for two families, who, in
winter, slept closely packed around them. Above, just under the vaulted
roof, were a great number of poles, like the perches of a hen-roost, and
here were suspended weapons, clothing, skins, and ornaments. Here, too,
in harvest time, the squaws hung the ears of unshelled corn, till the
rude abode, through all its length, seemed decked with a golden
tapestry. In general, however, its only lining was a thick coating
of soot from the smoke of fires with neither draught, chimney, nor window.
So pungent was the smoke, that it produced inflammation of the
eyes, attended in old age with frequent blindness.

Another annoyance was the fleas; and a third, the unbridled and unruly
children. Privacy there was none. The house was one chamber, sometimes
lodging more than twenty families.

[ One of the best descriptions of the Huron and Iroquois houses is that
of Sagard, Voyage des Hurons, 118. See also Champlain (1627), 78;
Brebeuf, Relation des Hurons, 1635, 31; Vanderdonck, New Netherlands,
in N. Y. Hist. Coll., Second Ser., I. 196; Lafitau, Moeurs des
Sauvages, II. 10. The account given by Cartier of the houses he saw
at Montreal corresponds with the above. He describes them as about fifty
yards long.
In this case, there were partial partitions for the several families, and
a sort of loft above. Many of the Iroquois and Huron houses were of
similar construction, the partitions being at the sides only,
leaving a wide passage down the middle of the house.

Bartram, Observations on a Journey from Pennsylvania to Canada, gives a
description and plan of the Iroquois Council-House in 1751, which
was of this construction.

Indeed, the Iroquois preserved this mode of building, in all essential
points, down to a recent period. They usually framed the sides of their
houses on rows of upright posts, arched with separate poles for the
roof.
The Hurons, no doubt, did the same in their larger structures. For a door,
there was a sheet of bark hung on wooden hinges, or suspended by cords
from above.

On the site of Huron towns which were destroyed by fire, the size, shape,
and arrangement of the houses can still, in some instances, be traced
by remains in the form of charcoal, as well as by the charred bones and
fragments of pottery found among the ashes.

Dr.

  Tache, after a zealous and minute examination of the Huron country,
  extended through five years, writes to me as follows. "From the
  remains I have found, I can vouch for the scrupulous correctness
  of our ancient writers. With the aid of their indications and
  descriptions, I have been able to detect the sites of villages
  in the midst of the forest, and by time study, in situ, of
archaeological monuments, small as they are, to understand and
confirm their many interesting details of the habits, and especially
the funeral rites, of these extraordinary tribes." ]
He who entered on a winter night beheld a strange spectacle: the
vista of fires lighting the smoky concave; the bronzed groups
encircling each,--cooking, eating, gambling, or amusing themselves
with idle badinage; shrivelled squaws, hideous with threescore years
of hardship; grisly old warriors, scarred with Iroquois war-clubs;
young aspirants, whose honors were yet to be won; damsels gay with
ochre and wampum; restless children pellmell with restless dogs.

Now a tongue of resinous flame painted each wild feature in vivid light;
now the fitful gleam expired, and the group vanished from sight, as their
nation has vanished from history.

The fortified towns of the Hurons were all on the side exposed to
Iroquois incursions. The fortifications of all this family of tribes
were, like their dwellings, in essential points alike. A situation was
chosen favorable to defence,--the bank of a lake, the crown of a
difficult hill, or a high point of land in the fork of confluent rivers.

A ditch, several feet deep, was dug around the village, and the earth
thrown up on the inside. Trees were then felled by an alternate process
of burning and hacking the burnt part with stone hatchets, and by similar
means were cut into lengths to form palisades.

These were planted on the embankment, in one, two, three, or four
concentric rows,--those of each row inclining towards those of the
other rows until they intersected.

The whole was lined within, to the height of a man, with heavy sheets
of bark; and at the top, where the palisades crossed, was a gallery of
timber for the defenders, together with wooden gutters, by which streams
of water could be poured down on fires kindled by the enemy. Magazines
of stones, and rude ladders for mounting the rampart, completed
the provision for defence.

The forts of the Iroquois were stronger and more elaborate than those
of the Hurons; and to this day large districts in New York are
marked with frequent remains of their ditches and embankments

.

[ There is no mathematical regularity in these works.

The dog's eyebrows moved continually: his brilliant
eyes travelled from one to the other; and presently he heaved a deep
sigh, as much as to say, "It's all quite true--quite true."

If there had been hesitation about keeping Murphy before, there was an end
to it now. Here was a dog--a young life--that had once, and not so long
ago, been the delight of the kennel, the very embodiment of light-hearted
fun and happiness; the most promising of all the younger lot, and one that
had never been guilty of wrong. Send him back! Give him up! What might his
fate be if he went elsewhere? Death? Look at him. Look at his large
brilliant eyes. They betoken nervousness, of course--inherent nervousness,
probably. A cruel injustice had been done by this dumb thing, and by one
of Us. Give him up! Clearly everything most prized was at stake, and
claimed the exact opposite.

Why should a different justice be the lot of a dog to that meted out to a
man? Is the superiority all one way? Each man knows in his heart that it
is not; that the dog is often the better of the two.

How the thoughts raced through the brain!

"Murphy?" It was his new master that called him now.

Perhaps the presence of the Over-Lord had given the young dog confidence:
_he_, at least, had been linked with happy times. Murphy got up
hesitatingly and came to his new master's chair, with his ears drooping.
He even suffered himself to be taken into this new master's lap, though
not without great nervousness.

And after that the Over-Lord rose and said good-bye.

"No, Murphy, we won't part," were the last words he heard as he left the
door; and this was the last time the generous Over-Lord was destined ever
to set eyes on Murphy.


                                   VI


Others laughed when they heard the final verdict, and called the
undertaking hopeless and sentimental. The hopelessness remained to be
proved; and, as to the sentimental part of the business, some one averred
that sentiment lay at the bottom of most things. It might be unpractical
from a philosophic point of view, as well as often fitting matter for a
jibe; but sentiment, all the same, was generally a source of strength!
Without it neither nation nor man would be likely to get far; it
reflected the noblest part of man's nature, and touched a nation at its
quick, if flags meant anything, and were to be followed and set store by.

There was quite a bandying of words over the matter. This dog was so
different to Dan. It was not a matter of argument, certainly not on
abstruse points. The dog had been broken in nerve, and admittedly by
ill-usage. Probably he had been nervous from the first, and there was
therefore all the less chance of his recovery.

To this was interposed the fact that many well-bred dogs are
constitutionally nervous, and continue to be so all their lives, their
condition in this respect being probably largely due to their brain
development and increased powers of imagination.

That might be the case, came the answer; but all the same--how about the
tail? The nervous organisation of this dog and his imagination had to do
with his brain, which his eyes showed to be capable of development. These
points had to do with the head. What about the other end? The index to a
dog's character, as well as to his immediate proceedings, lies, as we all
know, in his tail--the angle at which it is held, the way it moves or
remains stiff and immovable; its position before a fight, its twist to
one side when stalking, its confident carriage when the owner has "got
his tail up." All these are so many signals, generally recognised by man
and other dogs alike. Granting all this, what was to be said here? This
dog had now been several days in the house, and no one had apparently
seen his tail: it had been kept firmly down, and in such a way as to
suggest that had it been long enough it would have been well between his
legs.

At this, some one said that he had seen it once, and it was bushy; the
only effect of this remark being to elicit the rejoinder that "_then_ it
wanted pulling." Another averred that, of course, nothing could be hoped
for till he got his tail up: the job was how to set about securing so
essential a condition in the case of the tail of this particular dog. No
doubt the first thing to be done was to win him to the habit of standing
on his feet: it was obviously impossible to attempt anything with the
tail till this was achieved. So far, his attitude had been best
describable as that of the prone position. If anybody moved, he crouched
still lower; if he was persuaded to enter another room than the one he
had particularly taken to, he grovelled; if there was any sudden movement
or noise, he was terror-stricken; and, added to all this, it was obvious
that he could never be a watch-dog, for he refused to sleep alone.

Of course he ought to have gone back; and all these notions about
"bringing him round," giving him another chance and a happy life, were so
much high faluting rubbish.

In the face of such arguments, based, as they obviously were, on
universal testimony, even the faith of the person most nearly concerned
and wholly responsible must, it was judged, eventually give way.

But if counsels and opinions alike failed to alter the decision that had
been come to, they equally also supplied no answer to the momentous
question--how, seeing he was to be kept, was the confidence of this dog to
be won? There was hope in Dan, of course. He would teach him plenty of
things, and tell him much besides. A good deal of faith was placed in this
direction. But, even then, what about the general training? This dog would
run riot, be disobedient and unruly, hunt when and where he should not,
like other dogs before him, or even run sheep. If these things happened,
what was to be done? To thrash him would be almost an act of cruelty by a
dog of such a temperament: it might make him more nervous than ever, even
if he could be caught for the purpose and made to understand the rudiments
of cause and effect. Dan had learnt to "come and be thrashed," when such
was necessary and he was summoned in those most ominous of words. It might
be possible to teach Murphy in the same way: dogs, somehow or other, were
almost universally capable of differentiating between justice and
injustice, and bore no resentment. The reflection gave relief. Ils
n'entendent pas bien nostre Theologie, mais ils entendent parfaictement
bien nostre humilite et nostre affabilite, et se laissent gaigner."

So too Brebeuf, in a letter to Vitelleschi, General of the Jesuits (see
Carayon, 163): "Ce qu'il faut demander, avant tout, des ouvriers destines
a cette mission, c'est une douceur inalterable et une patience a toute
epreuve." ]
The Fathers are well agreed that their difficulties did not arise from any
natural defect of understanding on the part of the Indians, who, according
to Chaumonot, were more intelligent than the French peasantry, and
who, in some instances, showed in their way a marked capacity.

It was the inert mass of pride, sensuality, indolence, and superstition
that opposed the march of the Faith, and in which the Devil lay intrenched
as behind impregnable breastworks.

[ In this connection, the following specimen of Indian reasoning is worth
noting. At the height of the pestilence, a Huron said to one of the
priests, "I see plainly that your God is angry with us because we
will not believe and obey him. Ihonatiria, where you first taught his
word, is entirely ruined. Then you came here to Ossossane, and we
would not listen; so Ossossane is ruined too. This year you have been all
through our country, and found scarcely any who would do what God
commands; therefore the pestilence is everywhere." After premises so
hopeful, the Fathers looked for a satisfactory conclusion; but the Indian
proceeded--"My opinion is, that we ought to shut you out from all the
houses, and stop our ears when you speak of God, so that we cannot
hear.

Then we shall not be so guilty of rejecting the truth, and he will
not punish us so cruelly."--Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1640, 80. ]
It soon became evident that it was easier to make a convert than to keep
him. Many of the Indians clung to the idea that baptism was a safeguard
against pestilence and misfortune; and when the fallacy of this
notion was made apparent, their zeal cooled.

Their only amusements consisted of feasts, dances, and games, many of
which were, to a greater or less degree, of a superstitious character;
and as the Fathers could rarely prove to their own satisfaction the
absence of the diabolic element in any one of them, they proscribed
the whole indiscriminately, to the extreme disgust of the neophyte. His
countrymen, too, beset him with dismal prognostics: as, "You will kill
no more game,"--"All your hair will come out before spring," and so
forth. Various doubts also assailed him with regard to the substantial
advantages of his new profession; and several converts were filled with
anxiety in view of the probable want of tobacco in Heaven, saying that
they could not do without it. [ Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1639, 80.
] Nor was it pleasant to these incipient Christians, as they sat
in class listening to the instructions of their teacher, to find
themselves and him suddenly made the targets of a shower of sticks,
snowballs, corn-cobs, and other rubbish, flung at them by a screeching
rabble of vagabond boys. [ Ibid., 78. ]
Yet, while most of the neophytes demanded an anxious and diligent
cultivation, there were a few of excellent promise; and of one or
two especially, the Fathers, in the fulness of their satisfaction,
assure us again and again "that they were savage only in name

."
[ From June, 1639, to June, 1640, about a thousand persons were baptized.

Of these, two hundred and sixty were infants, and many more were children.
Very many died soon after baptism. Of the whole number, less than twenty
were baptized in health,--a number much below that of the preceding
year.

The following is a curious case of precocious piety. It is that of a
child at St. Joseph. "Elle n'a que deux ans, et fait joliment le signe
de la croix, et prend elle-meme de l'eau benite; et une fois se mit a
crier, sortant de la Chapelle, a cause que sa mere qui la portoit ne
lui avoit donne le loisir d'en prendre. Il l'a fallu reporter en
prendre."-- Lettres de Garnier, MSS. ]
As the town of Ihonatiria, where the Jesuits had made their first abode,
was ruined by the pestilence, the mission established there, and
known by the name of St.

Joseph, was removed, in the summer of 1638, to Teanaustaye, a large
town at the foot of a range of hills near the southern borders of the
Huron territory. The Hurons, this year, had had unwonted successes in
their war with the Iroquois, and had taken, at various times, nearly a
hundred prisoners. Many of these were brought to the seat of the new
mission of St. Joseph, and put to death with frightful tortures,
though not before several had been converted and baptized.

The torture was followed, in spite of the remonstrances of the priests,
by those cannibal feasts customary with the Hurons on such occasions.
Once, when the Fathers had been strenuous in their denunciations, a
hand of the victim, duly prepared, was flung in at their door, as
an invitation to join in the festivity. As the owner of the severed member
had been baptized, they dug a hole in their chapel, and buried it with
solemn rites of sepulture. [ Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1639,
70. ]

CHAPTER XII.

1639, 1640.

THE TOBACCO NATION.--THE NEUTRALS.

A CHANGE OF PLAN.--SAINTE MARIE.--MISSION OF THE TOBACCO NATION.-- WINTER
JOURNEYING.--RECEPTION OF THE MISSIONARIES.-- SUPERSTITIOUS
TERRORS.--PERIL OF GARNIER AND JOGUES.-- MISSION OF THE NEUTRALS.--HURON
INTRIGUES.--MIRACLES.-- FURY OF THE INDIANS.--INTERVENTION OF SAINT
MICHAEL.-- RETURN TO SAINTE MARIE.--INTREPIDITY OF THE PRIESTS.-- THEIR
MENTAL EXALTATION.

It had been the first purpose of the Jesuits to form permanent missions in
each of the principal Huron towns; but, before the close of the year
1639, the difficulties and risks of this scheme had become fully
apparent. They resolved, therefore, to establish one central station,
to be a base of operations, and, as it were, a focus, whence the
light of the Faith should radiate through all the wilderness around. It
was to serve at once as residence, fort, magazine, hospital, and convent.

Hence the priests would set forth on missionary expeditions far and near;
and hither they might retire, as to an asylum, in times of sickness
or extreme peril. Here the neophytes could be gathered together, safe
from perverting influences; and here in time a Christian settlement,
Hurons mingled with Frenchmen, might spring up and thrive under the shadow
of the cross.

The site of the new station was admirably chosen.

The little river Wye flows from the southward into the Matchedash Bay
of Lake Huron, and, at about a mile from its mouth, passes through
a small lake. The Jesuits made choice of the right bank of the Wye,
where it issues from this lake,--gained permission to build from the
Indians, though not without difficulty,--and began their labors with an
abundant energy, and a very deficient supply of workmen and tools. The new
establishment was called Sainte Marie. The house at Teanaustaye,
and the house and chapel at Ossossane, were abandoned, and all was
concentrated at this spot.
On one hand, it had a short water communication with Lake Huron; and
on the other, its central position gave the readiest access to every part
of the Huron territory.

During the summer before, the priests had made a survey of their field of
action, visited all the Huron towns, and christened each of them
with the name of a saint.

This heavy draft on the calendar was followed by another, for the
designation of the nine towns of the neighboring and kindred people
of the Tobacco Nation. [ See Introduction. ] The Huron towns were
portioned into four districts, while those of the Tobacco Nation formed
a fifth, and each district was assigned to the charge of two or more
priests. In November and December, they began their missionary
excursions,--for the Indians were now gathered in their settlements,--and
journeyed on foot through the denuded forests, in mud and snow, bearing
on their backs the vessels and utensils necessary for the service of the
altar.

The new and perilous mission of the Tobacco Nation fell to Garnier and
Jogues. They were well chosen; and yet neither of them was robust by
nature, in body or mind, though Jogues was noted for personal
activity.

The Tobacco Nation lay at the distance of a two days' journey from the
Huron towns, among the mountains at the head of Nottawassaga Bay.
The two missionaries tried to find a guide at Ossossane; but none
would go with them, and they set forth on their wild and unknown
pilgrimage alone.

The forests were full of snow; and the soft, moist flakes were still
falling thickly, obscuring the air, beplastering the gray trunks,
weighing to the earth the boughs of spruce and pine, and hiding
every footprint of the narrow path. The Fathers missed their way, and
toiled on till night, shaking down at every step from the burdened branches
a shower of fleecy white on their black cassocks.

Night overtook them in a spruce swamp. Here they made a fire with great
difficulty, cut the evergreen boughs, piled them for a bed, and lay
down. The storm presently ceased; and, "praised be God," writes one of
the travellers, "we passed a very good night." [ Jogues and Garnier
in Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1640, 95. ]
In the morning they breakfasted on a morsel of corn bread, and,
resuming their journey, fell in with a small party of Indians, whom
they followed all day without food.

                                   At eight in the evening they reached the first Tobacco town, a
miserable cluster of bark cabins, hidden among forests and half
buried in snow-drifts, where the savage children, seeing the two
black apparitions, screamed that Famine and the Pest were coming.

Their evil fame had gone before them. They were unwelcome guests; nevertheless,
shivering and famished as they were, in the cold and darkness, they
boldly pushed their way into one of these dens of barbarism. It was
precisely like a Huron house. Five or six fires blazed on the
earthen floor, and around them were huddled twice that number of families,
sitting, crouching, standing, or flat on the ground; old and young, women
and men, children and dogs, mingled pell-mell.
The scene would have been a strange one by daylight: it was doubly strange
by the flicker and glare of the lodge-fires. Scowling brows, sidelong
looks of distrust and fear, the screams of scared children, the
scolding of squaws, the growling of wolfish dogs,--this was the
greeting of the strangers.

The chief man of the household treated them at first with the decencies of
Indian hospitality; but when he saw them kneeling in the litter and ashes
at their devotions, his suppressed fears found vent, and he began a loud
harangue, addressed half to them and half to the Indians. "Now, what are
these _okies_ doing? They are making charms to kill us, and destroy
all that the pest has spared in this house.
I heard that they were sorcerers; and now, when it is too late, I
believe it." [ Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1640, 96. ] It is
wonderful that the priests escaped the tomahawk. Nowhere is the power
of courage, faith, and an unflinching purpose more strikingly displayed
than in the record of these missions.

In other Tobacco towns their reception was much the same; but
at the largest, called by them St. Peter and St. Paul, they fared
worse.
They reached it on a winter afternoon.

Every door of its capacious bark houses was closed against them; and they
heard the squaws within calling on the young men to go out and split their
heads, while children screamed abuse at the black-robed sorcerers. As
night approached, they left the town, when a band of young men followed
them, hatchet in hand, to put them to death.

Darkness, the forest, and the mountain favored them; and, eluding their
pursuers, they escaped. Thus began the mission of the Tobacco Nation.

In the following November, a yet more distant and perilous mission was
begun. Brebeuf and Chaumonot set out for the Neutral Nation. This fierce
people, as we have already seen, occupied that part of Canada which lies
immediately north of Lake Erie, while a wing of their territory extended
across the Niagara into Western New York. [ 1 ] In their athletic
proportions, the ferocity of their manners, and the extravagance of their
superstitions, no American tribe has ever exceeded them. They carried to
a preposterous excess the Indian notion, that insanity is endowed
with a mysterious and superhuman power. Their country was full of pretended
maniacs, who, to propitiate their guardian spirits, or _okies_, and acquire
the mystic virtue which pertained to madness, raved stark naked through
the villages, scattering the brands of the lodge-fires, and upsetting
everything in their way

.

[ 1 Introduction.--The river Niagara was at this time, 1640, well known
to the Jesuits, though none of them had visited it. Lalemant speaks of
it as the "famous river of this nation" (the Neutrals). The following
translation, from his Relation of 1641, shows that both Lake Ontario and
Lake Erie had already taken their present names.

"This river" (the Niagara) "is the same by which our great lake of the
Hurons, or Fresh Sea, discharges itself, in the first place, into Lake
Erie (le lac d'Erie), or the Lake of the Cat Nation.

Then it enters the territories of the Neutral Nation, and takes the name
of Onguiaahra (Niagara), until it discharges itself into Ontario, or the
Lake of St. Louis; whence at last issues the river which passes before
Quebec, and is called the St. Lawrence." He makes no allusion to the
cataract, which is first mentioned as follows by Ragueneau, in the
Relation of 1648.

"Nearly south of this same Neutral Nation there is a great lake, about
two hundred leagues in circuit, named Erie (Erie), which is formed
by the discharge of the Fresh Sea, and which precipitates itself by
a cataract of frightful height into a third lake, named Ontario, which
we call Lake St. Louis."--Relation des Hurons, 1648, 46. ]
The two priests left Sainte Marie on the second of November, found a Huron
guide at St. Joseph, and, after a dreary march of five days through the
forest, reached the first Neutral town. Advancing thence, they
visited in turn eighteen others; and their progress was a storm of
maledictions. Brebeuf especially was accounted the most pestilent of
sorcerers. The Hurons, restrained by a superstitious awe, and unwilling
to kill the priests, lest they should embroil themselves with the French
at Quebec, conceived that their object might be safely gained by stirring
up the Neutrals to become their executioners. To that end, they sent two
emissaries to the Neutral towns, who, calling the chiefs and young
warriors to a council, denounced the Jesuits as destroyers of the
human race, and made their auditors a gift of nine French hatchets
on condition that they would put them to death.

It was now that Brebeuf, fully conscious of the danger, half starved and
half frozen, driven with revilings from every door, struck and spit upon
by pretended maniacs, beheld in a vision that great cross, which as
we have seen, moved onward through the air, above the wintry forests
that stretched towards the land of the Iroquois. [ See ante, chapter
9 second last paragraph (page 109). ]
Chaumonot records yet another miracle.

"One evening, when all the chief men of the town were deliberating in
council whether to put us to death, Father Brebeuf, while making his
examination of conscience, as we were together at prayers, saw the vision
of a spectre, full of fury, menacing us both with three javelins which
he held in his hands. Then he hurled one of them at us; but a more powerful
hand caught it as it flew: and this took place a second and a third
time, as he hurled his two remaining javelins. . . . Late at night our
host came back from the council, where the two Huron emissaries had
made their gift of hatchets to have us killed.

He wakened us to say that three times we had been at the point of death;
for the young men had offered three times to strike the blow, and
three times the old men had dissuaded them. This explained the meaning
of Father Brebeuf's vision." [ Chaumonot, Vie, 55. ]
They had escaped for the time; but the Indians agreed among themselves,
that thenceforth no one should give them shelter. At night, pierced with
cold and faint with hunger, they found every door closed against
them.

They stood and watched, saw an Indian issue from a house, and, by a quick
movement, pushed through the half-open door into this abode of smoke
and filth. The inmates, aghast at their boldness, stared in
silence.
Then a messenger ran out to carry the tidings, and an angry crowd
collected.

"Go out, and leave our country," said an old chief, "or we will put you
into the kettle, and make a feast of you."
"I have had enough of the dark-colored flesh of our enemies," said a young
brave; "I wish to know the taste of white meat, and I will eat yours."

A warrior rushed in like a madman, drew his bow, and aimed the arrow at
Chaumonot. "I looked at him fixedly," writes the Jesuit, "and commended
myself in full confidence to St. Michael. Without doubt, this great
archangel saved us; for almost immediately the fury of the warrior was
appeased, and the rest of our enemies soon began to listen to the
explanation we gave them of our visit to their country." [ Ibid., 57. ]

The mission was barren of any other fruit than hardship and danger, and
after a stay of four months the two priests resolved to return.
On the way, they met a genuine act of kindness. A heavy snow-storm arresting
their progress, a Neutral woman took them into her lodge, entertained
them for two weeks with her best fare, persuaded her father and
relatives to befriend them, and aided them to make a vocabulary of
the dialect.

Bidding their generous hostess farewell, they journeyed northward,
through the melting snows of spring, and reached Sainte Marie in safety.

[ Lalemant, in his Relation of 1641, gives the narrative of this mission
at length. His account coincides perfectly with the briefer notice
of Chaumonot in his Autobiography. Chaumonot describes the difficulties
of the journey very graphically in a letter to his friend, Father Nappi,
dated Aug. 3, 1640, preserved in Carayon.

See also the next letter, Brebeuf au T. R. P. Mutio Vitelleschi, 20
Aout, 1641.

The Recollet La Roche Dallion had visited the Neutrals fourteen years
before, (see Introduction, note,) and, like his two successors, had been
seriously endangered by Huron intrigues. ]
The Jesuits had borne all that the human frame seems capable of
bearing.

They had escaped as by miracle from torture and death. Did their zeal
flag or their courage fail? A fervor intense and unquenchable urged them
on to more distant and more deadly ventures. The beings, so near to
mortal sympathies, so human, yet so divine, in whom their faith
impersonated and dramatized the great principles of Christian truth,--
virgins, saints, and angels,--hovered over them, and held before
their raptured sight crowns of glory and garlands of immortal
bliss. They burned to do, to suffer, and to die; and now, from out a living
martyrdom, they turned their heroic gaze towards an horizon dark with
perils yet more appalling, and saw in hope the day when they should bear
the cross into the blood-stained dens of the Iroquois. [ This zeal was
in no degree due to success; for in 1641, after seven years of toil, the
mission counted only about fifty living converts,--a falling off from
former years. ]
But, in this exaltation and tension of the powers, was there no moment
when the recoil of Nature claimed a temporary sway? When, an exile from
his kind, alone, beneath the desolate rock and the gloomy pine-trees,
the priest gazed forth on the pitiless wilderness and the hovels
of its dark and ruthless tenants, his thoughts, it may be, flew
longingly beyond those wastes of forest and sea that lay between
him and the home of his boyhood.

Or rather, led by a deeper attraction, they revisited the ancient centre
of his faith, and he seemed to stand once more in that gorgeous temple,
where, shrined in lazuli and gold, rest the hallowed bones of Loyola.
Column and arch and dome rise upon his vision, radiant in painted light,
and trembling with celestial music. Again he kneels before the altar,
from whose tablature beams upon him that loveliest of shapes in which
the imagination of man has embodied the spirit of Christianity.
The illusion overpowers him. A thrill shakes his frame, and he bows in
reverential rapture. No longer a memory, no longer a dream, but a
visioned presence, distinct and luminous in the forest shades, the
Virgin stands before him.

Prostrate on the rocky earth, he adores the benign angel of his ecstatic
faith, then turns with rekindled fervors to his stern apostleship.

Now, by the shores of Thunder Bay, the Huron traders freight their birch
vessels for their yearly voyage; and, embarked with them, let us, too,
revisit the rock of Quebec.

I have traced, in another volume, the life and death of the noble
founder of New France, Samuel de Champlain. It was on Christmas Day,
1635, that his heroic spirit bade farewell to the frame it had animated,
and to the rugged cliff where he had toiled so long to lay the corner-
stone of a Christian empire.

Quebec was without a governor. Who should succeed Champlain and would his
successor be found equally zealous for the Faith, and friendly to
the mission?

These doubts, as he himself tells us, agitated the mind of the
Father Superior, Le Jeune; but they were happily set at rest, when,
on a morning in June, he saw a ship anchoring in the basin below,
and, hastening with his brethren to the landing-place, was there met
by Charles Huault de Montmagny, a Knight of Malta, followed by a train
of officers and gentlemen. As they all climbed the rock together,
Montmagny saw a crucifix planted by the path. He instantly fell on his
knees before it; and nobles, soldiers, sailors, and priests imitated his
example. The Jesuits sang Te Deum at the church, and the cannon roared
from the adjacent fort. Here the new governor was scarcely installed,
when a Jesuit came in to ask if he would be godfather to an Indian about
to be baptized.

"Most gladly," replied the pious Montmagny. He repaired on the instant
to the convert's hut, with a company of gayly apparelled gentlemen;
and while the inmates stared in amazement at the scarlet and embroidery,
he bestowed on the dying savage the name of Joseph, in honor of
the spouse of the Virgin and the patron of New France. [ Le Jeune, Relation,
1636, 5 (Cramoisy). "Monsieur le Gouverneur se transporte aux Cabanes
de ces pauures barbares, suivy d'une leste Noblesse. Je vous laisse a
penser quel estonnement a ces Peuples de voir tant d'ecarlate, tant de
personnes bien faites sous leurs toits d'ecorce!" ] Three days after,
he was told that a dead proselyte was to be buried; on which,
leaving the lines of the new fortification he was tracing, he took
in hand a torch, De Lisle, his lieutenant, took another, Repentigny
and St. Jean, gentlemen of his suite, with a band of soldiers
followed, two priests bore the corpse, and thus all moved together
in procession to the place of burial. The Jesuits were comforted.
Champlain himself had not displayed a zeal so edifying. [ Ibid.,
83 (Cramoisy). ]
A considerable reinforcement came out with Montmagny, and among the
rest several men of birth and substance, with their families and
dependants.
"It was a sight to thank God for," exclaims Father Le Jeune, "to
behold these delicate young ladies and these tender infants issuing
from their wooden prison, like day from the shades of night." The
Father, it will be remembered, had for some years past seen nothing
but squaws, with papooses swathed like mummies and strapped to a
board.
He was even more pleased with the contents of a huge packet of
letters that was placed in his hands, bearing the signatures of
nuns, priests, soldiers, courtiers, and princesses. A great interest
in the mission had been kindled in France. Le Jeune's printed
Relations had been read with avidity; and his Jesuit brethren, who,
as teachers, preachers, and confessors, had spread themselves through
the nation, had successfully fanned the rising flame. The Father
Superior finds no words for his joy.
"Heaven," he exclaims, "is the conductor of this enterprise. Nature's
arms are not long enough to touch so many hearts." [ "C'est Dieu
qui conduit cette entreprise.Perhaps Dan, whose repertory was large,
had told him what a bore they were, and cautioned him to do his utmost to
avoid them.


                                  VIII


About a year after Murphy's arrival, Dan was gathered to his forefathers,
and there was mourning throughout the house for many days. To one at
least, if not to more, Alphonse Karr's remark held good--_On n'a dans la
vie qu'un chien_--and Dan was that dog. His life had been long; he had
won all hearts; he had done many wonderful things, besides fulfilling his
duties as a faithful constable of the place in which his lot was cast;
and now, loving and beloved, he had died. Such were the data from which
his epitaph had to be evolved. Man could desire no better. To have been
loved--that, all said and done, is the great thing, for it comprises all
others. Another French writer reckoned it the highest eulogy bestowable,
and it seems as if he was not far wrong, whether we have before us dogs
or men.

One of Murphy's last acts by his grandfather reflected his own character,
no less than the affectionate relations existing between himself and Dan.
It was the custom to give the dogs certain biscuits after dinner of which
they were particularly fond, and they sat side by side to receive them.
One evening, when the biscuit tin was taken out as usual, Dan was absent.
He was old; probably asleep: better let Murphy have his, and have done
with it. The young dog refused to have anything to say to such
suggestions; and for the moment his attitude was put down to an access of
shyness, for these particular biscuits were irresistible. Presently he
began barking and running backwards and forwards to the door. Being let
through, he ran to another, found a third open, and presently returned in
a perfect ecstasy of delight, with the old dog by his side. He
subsequently referred to the extraordinary stupidity that had been
evinced in a long and comprehensive speech. To steal a march on the old,
or to fail to treat them at all times with respect, was evidently, in his
opinion, wicked. At least, that was his text.

Dan's last resting-place was, of course, in the dogs' burial-ground in
the family home. To lie there was the highest honour bestowable, and Dan
had wholly earned it. --See Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1642, 60,
Ragueneau, Ibid., 1648, 53, and several other passages. ]
In regard to these atrocious scenes, which formed the favorite Huron
recreation of a summer night, the Jesuits, it must be confessed,
did not quite come up to the requirements of modern sensibility.

They were offended at them, it is true, and prevented them when they could;
but they were wholly given to the saving of souls, and held the body in
scorn, as the vile source of incalculable mischief, worthy the worst
inflictions that could be put upon it. What were a few hours of
suffering to an eternity of bliss or woe? If the victim were heathen,
these brief pangs were but the faint prelude of an undying flame; and if
a Christian, they were the fiery portal of Heaven. They might, indeed,
be a blessing; since, accepted in atonement for sin, they would
shorten the torments of Purgatory. Yet, while schooling themselves
to despise the body, and all the pain or pleasure that pertained to it,
the Fathers were emphatic on one point. It must not be eaten. In the
matter of cannibalism, they were loud and vehement in invective.

[ The following curious case of conversion at the stake, gravely
related by Lalemant, is worth preserving.

"An Iroquois was to be burned at a town some way off. What consolation
to set forth, in the hottest summer weather, to deliver this poor victim
from the hell prepared for him! The Father approaches him, and instructs
him even in the midst of his torments. Forthwith the Faith finds a place
in his heart, he recognizes and adores, as the author of his life, Him
whose name he had never heard till the hour of his death. He
receives the grace of baptism, and breathes nothing but heaven. . . .
This newly made, but generous Christian, mounted on the scaffold which
is the place of his torture, in the sight of a thousand spectators,
who are at once his enemies, his judges, and his executioners,
raises his eyes and his voice heavenward, and cries aloud, 'Sun,
who art witness of my torments, hear my words!

I am about to die; but, after my death, I shall go to dwell in
heaven.'"--Relation des Hurons, 1641, 67.

The Sun, it will be remembered, was the god of the heathen Iroquois.
The convert appealed to his old deity to rejoice with him in his happy
future. ]
Undeniably, the Faith was making progress; yet it is not to be supposed
that its path was a smooth one.

The old opposition and the old calumnies were still alive and active. "It
is _la priere_ that kills us. Your books and your strings of beads have
bewitched the country. Before you came, we were happy and prosperous.
You are magicians. Your charms kill our corn, and bring sickness and
the Iroquois. Echon (Brebeuf) is a traitor among us, in league with our
enemies." Such discourse was still rife, openly and secretly.

The Huron who embraced the Faith renounced thenceforth, as we have seen,
the feasts, dances, and games in which was his delight, since all
these savored of diabolism. And if, being in health, he could not enjoy
himself, so also, being sick, he could not be cured; for his physician
was a sorcerer, whose medicines were charms and incantations. If the
convert was a chief, his case was far worse; since, writes Father Lalemant,
"to be a chief and a Christian is to combine water and fire; for the
business of the chiefs is mainly to do the Devil's bidding, preside
over ceremonies of hell, and excite the young Indians to dances,
feasts, and shameless indecencies

."
[ Relation des Hurons, 1642, 89. The indecencies alluded to were chiefly
naked dances, of a superstitious character, and the mystical cure called
Andacwandet, before mentioned. ]
It is not surprising, then, that proselytes were difficult to make, or
that, being made, they often relapsed.

The Jesuits complain that they had no means of controlling their
converts, and coercing backsliders to stand fast; and they add, that
the Iroquois, by destroying the fur-trade, had broken the principal
bond between the Hurons and the French, and greatly weakened the
influence of the mission. [ Lettre du P. Hierosme Lalemant, appended to
the Relation of 1645. ]
Among the slanders devised by the heathen party against the
teachers of the obnoxious doctrine was one which found wide credence,
even among the converts, and produced a great effect. They gave out that
a baptized Huron girl, who had lately died, and was buried in the cemetery
at Sainte Marie, had returned to life, and given a deplorable account
of the heaven of the French. No sooner had she entered,--such was the
story,--than they seized her, chained her to a stake, and tormented
her all day with inconceivable cruelty.

They did the same to all the other converted Hurons; for this was the
recreation of the French, and especially of the Jesuits, in their celestial
abode. They baptized Indians with no other object than that they might
have them to torment in heaven; to which end they were willing to meet
hardships and dangers in this life, just as a war-party invades
the enemy's country at great risk that it may bring home prisoners
to burn.

After her painful experience, an unknown friend secretly showed the girl a
path down to the earth; and she hastened thither to warn her countrymen
against the wiles of the missionaries.
[ Ragueneau, Relation des Hurons, 1646, 65. ]
In the spring of 1648 the excitement of the heathen party reached a crisis.
A young Frenchman, named Jacques Douart, in the service of the mission,
going out at evening a short distance from the Jesuit house of Sainte
Marie, was tomahawked by unknown Indians, [ 1 ] who proved to be two
brothers, instigated by the heathen chiefs. A great commotion followed,
and for a few days it seemed that the adverse parties would fall to
blows, at a time when the common enemy threatened to destroy them
both.

But sager counsels prevailed. In view of the manifest strength of the
Christians, the pagans lowered their tone; and it soon became apparent
that it was the part of the Jesuits to insist boldly on satisfaction for
the outrage. They made no demand that the murderers should be punished
or surrendered, but, with their usual good sense in such matters, conformed
to Indian usage, and required that the nation at large should make
atonement for the crime by presents. [ 2 ] The number of these,
their value, and the mode of delivering them were all fixed by
ancient custom; and some of the converts, acting as counsel, advised
the Fathers of every step it behooved them to take in a case of
such importance.

As this is the best illustration of Huron justice on record, it may
be well to observe the method of procedure,--recollecting that the
public, and not the criminal, was to pay the forfeit of the crime.

[ 1 Ragueneau, Relation des Hurons, 1648, 77. Compare Lettre du P. Jean
de Brebeuf au T. R. P. Vincent Carafa, General de la Compagnie de Jesus,
Sainte Marie, 2 Juin, 1648, in Carayon. ]
[ 2 See Introduction. ]
First of all, the Huron chiefs summoned the Jesuits to meet them
at a grand council of the nation, when an old orator, chosen by
the rest, rose and addressed Ragueneau, as chief of the French, in
the following harangue.

Ragueneau, who reports it, declares that he has added nothing to it,
and the translation is as literal as possible.

"My Brother," began the speaker, "behold all the tribes of our league
assembled!"--and he named them one by one. "We are but a handful; you are
the prop and stay of this nation. A thunderbolt has fallen from the
sky, and rent a chasm in the earth. We shall fall into it, if you
do not support us. Take pity on us. We are here, not so much to speak as
to weep over our loss and yours. Our country is but a skeleton, without
flesh, veins, sinews, or arteries; and its bones hang together by a thread.
This thread is broken by the blow that has fallen on the head of
your nephew, [ 1 ] for whom we weep.

It was a demon of Hell who placed the hatchet in the murderer's hand. Was
it you, Sun, whose beams shine on us, who led him to do this deed? Why
did you not darken your light, that he might be stricken with horror
at his crime? Were you his accomplice? No; for he walked in darkness,
and did not see where he struck. He thought, this wretched murderer,
that he aimed at the head of a young Frenchman; but the blow fell upon
his country, and gave it a death-wound. The earth opens to receive the
blood of the innocent victim, and we shall be swallowed up in the chasm;
for we are all guilty.
The Iroquois rejoice at his death, and celebrate it as a triumph; for
they see that our weapons are turned against each other, and know well
that our nation is near its end.

"Brother, take pity on this nation. You alone can restore it to life.

It is for you to gather up all these scattered bones, and close this
chasm that opens to ingulf us. Take pity on your country. I call it
yours, for you are the master of it; and we came here like criminals to
receive your sentence, if you will not show us mercy.

          Pity those who condemn themselves and
          come to ask forgiveness. It is you who
          have given strength to the nation by dwelling with
          it; and if you leave us, we shall be like a wisp of straw torn
from the ground to be the sport of the wind.

          This country is an island drifting on the waves, for
          the first storm to overwhelm and sink.
          Make it fast again to its foundation, and posterity
          will never forget to praise you.

          When we first heard of this murder,
          we could do nothing but weep; and we are ready
          to receive your orders and comply with your
          demands.

          Speak, then, and ask what satisfaction
          you will, for our lives and our possessions
          are yours; and even if we rob our children to
          satisfy you, we will tell them that it is not of you that they
have to complain, but of him whose crime has made us all guilty.

Our anger is against him; but for you we feel nothing but love. He destroyed
our lives; and you will restore them, if you will but speak and tell us
what you will have us do."
[ 1 The usual Indian figure in such cases, and not meant to express an
actual relationship;--"Uncle" for a superior, "Brother" for an equal,
"Nephew" for an inferior. ]
Ragueneau, who remarks that this harangue is a proof that eloquence is
the gift of Nature rather than of Art, made a reply, which he has
not recorded, and then gave the speaker a bundle of small sticks,
indicating the number of presents which he required in satisfaction
for the murder.

These sticks were distributed among the various tribes in the
council, in order that each might contribute its share towards the
indemnity.
The council dissolved, and the chiefs went home, each with his allotment
of sticks, to collect in his village a corresponding number of presents.

There was no constraint; those gave who chose to do so; but, as all were
ambitious to show their public spirit, the contributions were
ample.

No one thought of molesting the murderers. Their punishment was their
shame at the sacrifices which the public were making in their behalf.

The presents being ready, a day was set for the ceremony of their
delivery; and crowds gathered from all parts to witness it.

The assembly was convened in the open air, in a field beside the
mission-house of Sainte Marie; and, in the midst, the chiefs held
solemn council.

Towards evening, they deputed four of their number, two Christians
and two heathen, to carry their address to the Father Superior.

They came, loaded with presents; but these were merely preliminary. One was
to open the door, another for leave to enter; and as Sainte Marie
was a large house, with several interior doors, at each one of which
it behooved them to repeat this formality, their stock of gifts
became seriously reduced before they reached the room where Father
Ragueneau awaited them.

                                   On arriving, they made him a speech, every clause of which was
confirmed by a present.

The first was to wipe away his tears; the second, to restore his voice,
which his grief was supposed to have impaired; the third, to calm
the agitation of his mind; and the fourth, to allay the just anger
of his heart. [ 1 ] These gifts consisted of wampum and the large
shells of which it was made, together with other articles, worthless
in any eyes but those of an Indian.

Nine additional presents followed: four for the four posts of the sepulchre
or scaffold of the murdered man; four for the cross-pieces which connected
the posts; and one for a pillow to support his head. Then came eight
more, corresponding to the eight largest bones of the victim's body,
and also to the eight clans of the Hurons. [ 2 ] Ragueneau, as required
by established custom, now made them a present in his turn. It consisted
of three thousand beads of wampum, and was designed to soften the earth,
in order that they might not be hurt, when falling upon it, overpowered
by his reproaches for the enormity of their crime. This closed the
interview, and the deputation withdrew

.

[ 1 Ragueneau himself describes the scene. Relation des Hurons, 1648,
80. ]
[ 2 Ragueneau says, "les huit nations"; but, as the Hurons consisted of
only four, or at most five, nations, he probably means the clans.
For the nature of these divisions, see Introduction. ]
The grand ceremony took place on the next day. A kind of arena had been
prepared, and here were hung the fifty presents in which the atonement
essentially consisted,--the rest, amounting to as many more, being only
accessory. [ 1 ] The Jesuits had the right of examining them all,
rejecting any that did not satisfy them, and demanding others in place
of them. The naked crowd sat silent and attentive, while the orator
in the midst delivered the fifty presents in a series of harangues,
which the tired listener has not thought it necessary to preserve.

Then came the minor gifts, each with its signification explained in turn
by the speaker. First, as a sepulchre had been provided the day before for
the dead man, it was now necessary to clothe and equip him for his
journey to the next world; and to this end three presents were made.
They represented a hat, a coat, a shirt, breeches, stockings, shoes, a
gun, powder, and bullets; but they were in fact something quite
different, as wampum, beaver-skins, and the like. Next came several gifts
to close up the wounds of the slain. Then followed three more. The
first closed the chasm in the earth, which had burst through horror of
the crime.
The next trod the ground firm, that it might not open again; and
here the whole assembly rose and danced, as custom required.

The last placed a large stone over the closed gulf; to make it doubly
secure.

[ 1 The number was unusually large,--partly because the affair was
thought very important, and partly because the murdered man belonged to
another nation. See Introduction. ]
Now came another series of presents, seven in number,--to restore the
voices of all the missionaries,--to invite the men in their service
to forget the murder,--to appease the Governor when he should hear of
it,--to light the fire at Sainte Marie,--to open the gate,--to
launch the ferry boat in which the Huron visitors crossed the
river,--and to give back the paddle to the boy who had charge of
the boat.

The Fathers, it seems, had the right of exacting two more presents, to
rebuild their house and church,--supposed to have been shaken to the earth
by the late calamity; but they forbore to urge the claim. Last of
all were three gifts to confirm all the rest, and to entreat the Jesuits
to cherish an undying love for the Hurons.

The priests on their part gave presents, as tokens of good-will; and with
that the assembly dispersed. The mission had gained a triumph, and its
influence was greatly strengthened. The future would have been full of
hope, but for the portentous cloud of war that rose, black and wrathful,
from where lay the dens of the Iroquois.

CHAPTER XXV.

1648, 1649.

SAINTE MARIE.

THE CENTRE OF THE MISSIONS.--FORT.--CONVENT.--HOSPITAL.--CARAVANSARY.--
CHURCH.--THE INMATES OF SAINTE MARIE.--DOMESTIC ECONOMY.--MISSIONS.-- A
MEETING OF JESUITS.--THE DEAD MISSIONARY.

The River Wye enters the Bay of Glocester, an inlet of the Bay of Matchedash,
itself an inlet of the vast Georgian Bay of Lake Huron.
Retrace the track of two centuries and more, and ascend this little stream
in the summer of the year 1648. Your vessel is a birch canoe, and your
conductor a Huron Indian. On the right hand and on the left, gloomy
and silent, rise the primeval woods; but you have advanced scarcely half
a league when the scene is changed, and cultivated fields, planted
chiefly with maize, extend far along the bank, and back to the
distant verge of the forest. Before you opens the small lake from which
the stream issues; and on your left, a stone's throw from the shore,
rises a range of palisades and bastioned walls, inclosing a number of
buildings.

Your canoe enters a canal or ditch immediately above them, and you land
at the Mission, or Residence, or Fort of Sainte Marie.

Here was the centre and base of the Huron missions; and now, for once,
one must wish that Jesuit pens had been more fluent. They have told us
but little of Sainte Marie, and even this is to be gathered chiefly from
incidental allusions. In the forest, which long since has resumed its
reign over this memorable spot, the walls and ditches of the
fortifications may still be plainly traced; and the deductions
from these remains are in perfect accord with what we can gather from the
Relations and letters of the priests. [ Before me is an elaborate plan of
the remains, taken on the spot. ] The fortified work which inclosed
the buildings was in the form of a parallelogram, about a hundred
and seventy-five feet long, and from eighty to ninety wide.

It lay parallel with the river, and somewhat more than a hundred feet distant
from it.
On two sides it was a continuous wall of masonry, [ 1 ] flanked with
square bastions, adapted to musketry, and probably used as magazines,
storehouses, or lodgings. The sides towards the river and the lake had
no other defences than a ditch and palisade, flanked, like the others, by
bastions, over each of which was displayed a large cross. [ 2 ] The
buildings within were, no doubt, of wood; and they included a church,
a kitchen, a refectory, places of retreat for religious instruction
and meditation, [ 3 ] and lodgings for at least sixty persons.

Near the church, but outside the fortification, was a cemetery. Beyond
the ditch or canal which opened on the river was a large area, still
traceable, in the form of an irregular triangle, surrounded by a ditch,
and apparently by palisades. It seems to have been meant for the protection
of the Indian visitors who came in throngs to Sainte Marie, and who were
lodged in a large house of bark, after the Huron manner. [ 4 ]
Here, perhaps, was also the hospital, which was placed without the
walls, in order that Indian women, as well as men, might be admitted
into it.
[ 5 ]
[ 1 It seems probable that the walls, of which the remains may still
be traced, were foundations supporting a wooden superstructure.

Ragueneau, in a letter to the General of the Jesuits, dated March 13,
1650, alludes to the defences of Saint Marie as "une simple palissade."
]
[ 2 "Quatre grandes Croix qui sont aux quatre coins de nostre enclos."--
Ragueneau, Relation des Hurons, 1648, 81. ]
[ 3 It seems that these places, besides those for the priests, were of
two kinds,--"vne retraite pour les pelerins (Indians), enfin vn
lieu plus separe, ou les infideles, qui n'y sont admis que de iour au
passage, y puissent tousiours receuoir quelque bon mot pour leur
salut."

--Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1644, 74. ]
[ 4 At least it was so in 1642. "Nous leur auons dresse vn Hospice ou
Cabane d'ecorce."--Ibid., 1642, 57. ]
[ 5 "Cet hospital est tellement separe de nostre demeure, que non seulement
les hommes et enfans, mais les femmes y peuuent estre admises."--Ibid.,
1644, 74. ]
No doubt the buildings of Sainte Marie were of the roughest,--rude
walls of boards, windows without glass, vast chimneys of unhewn
stone.

All its riches were centred in the church, which, as Lalemant tells us,
was regarded by the Indians as one of the wonders of the world, but
which, he adds, would have made but a beggarly show in France. Yet one
wonders, at first thought, how so much labor could have been accomplished
here.
Of late years, however, the number of men at the command of the mission
had been considerable. Soldiers had been sent up from time to time, to
escort the Fathers on their way, and defend them on their arrival.
Thus, in 1644, Montmagny ordered twenty men of a reinforcement just
arrived from France to escort Brebeuf, Garreau, and Chabanel to the
Hurons, and remain there during the winter. [ 1 ] These soldiers
lodged with the Jesuits, and lived at their table. [ 2 ] It was
not, however, on detachments of troops that they mainly relied for
labor or defence.

Any inhabitant of Canada who chose to undertake so hard and dangerous
a service was allowed to do so, receiving only his maintenance from the
mission, without pay.
Do you
minds last season, when you and yer dog was along? I wus a-going across
the Dene with a bottle o' warm milk, with a bit of a tube stuck in it, if
you minds. 'Twas warm milk I'd taken from the cow. Ah, well, 'twas for a
lamb as had lost its mother: udder wrong; I could find of it when the
master brought the lot in. And I goes for to say as any un as 'ud serve a
yo that way should be crucified. Well, 'tis that very lamb as was as is
now the yo a-suckling the one we dressed up. See how things do work
round, don't 'em?"

But the talk was not always about sheep, when the folds or the pens were
visited, or "Him and his dog" walked with Nutt and other shepherds over
the open lands, in the wind and the weather.

One day Job had been busy sheepwashing, and the talk turned on dogs, as
it often did.

"'Tis wonderful what they knows. What don't 'em know? I says. See that
Scot I had--the one afore this un. Well, I was down a-sheepwashing, same
as I've been just. One o' the full-mouthed sheep as we had then broke
away, and went straight over river, and it ain't very narrow there, as
you minds. She got up on the further bank and stud. And Scot, he looks at
me, and across at the sheep, and then at me again. I know'd, right
enough, what he wanted. He wanted to go over and fetch that sheep back.
But I 'ouldn't let un, for a bit. And he kept a-looking and a-looking,
same as any one might speak. So I just moved my head, like; there was no
call to do no more. And off he set in the water, and swam river, ketched
the sheep by the throat--oh, no, he didn't hurt un, no fear!--dragged un
to the bank, and brought un over, right enough: he did, though."

"Well, 'twas like this," he continued, after a laugh. "A gen'leman was
a-rowing by in a boat at the time. And he comes across to our side, when
he sees what Scot 'a' done, and he says, 'Shepherd,' he says, 'I'll have
that dog off you, if you've a mind.' And with that he puts three golden
sovereigns on the bank at my feet, where we was busy a-sheepwashing. So I
looks at the sovereigns, and then at he, and says to un, with a laugh--I
says, '_No Sir_.' Lord, how he did pray me to let un have that dog!

"Then it come about this way. That evening we was a-coming down through
the village, and passed 'The Crown'--that was, Scot and me--and there
stood the same gen'leman at the door. So he comes across the road, seeing
me, and he says, 'Well, shepherd,' he says, 'will you part with the dog
now, for, if so be as you will, I'll make it five instead of three?' he
says. And that's truth. And I just looked he between the eyes, like, and
says, 'Part with my dog, Sir?' I says. 'Why, Sir, if I wus to part with
he, I'll tell ye what he'd do--he'd pine and die--he'd just pine away and
die.' And with that I passed on, and left un. Dogs--well, sheep, if you
do please to understand, is sheep; but dogs is dogs, and God Almighty do
know as they be wonderful."

"It's not all dogs, though, that are as shepherds' dogs, Nutt--or capable
of being."

Nutt shook his head. The two men and their dogs were on the hillside,
with two hundred and fifty tegs moving before them. The sheep were
walking with a wide front, but in single files, following those parallel
tracks that had marked this steep hillside for centuries, to puzzle
strangers.

"You can't make a shepherd's dog out of every dog, can you?"

"Perhaps not, in your meaning. But I do know I could train a'most any
dog, if as I'd be so minded."

Scot was on ahead, where he should be. Murphy was close to heel.

"Do you mean to say you could train this one to fold sheep?"

Job Nutt took a deep draw at his pipe, and turned and looked down at
Murphy, now just over three years old.

"I likes that dog; well, I've allus liked un. Train un to sheep? I
believe as I could, were I to be so minded: I do believe as I could."

The two had to part then. It was dusk, and looked like wet; moreover,
some wether sheep in the fold, far down in the valley, were "howling" for
rain: they were true weather-prophets always.

So he might be trained to sheep. Job Nutt's words kept repeating
themselves in the mind--"I believe as I could; I do believe as I could."
What the shepherd had said was a testimony to this dog's marvellous
intelligence; but then every one had come to testify to that and to
remark upon it. He was of course nervous and shy, and no doubt would
always be so. Perhaps it was these characteristics that gave him the
further one of extraordinary gentleness, that won all hearts. Many had
already said, with a laugh, that he was "born good"; but latterly some
had come to add that he was incapable of harm or ill.

And yet with these characteristics, amounting as they did to a certain
softness, there was never any question of his pluck and spirit. Nor was
there any limit to it. He had the spirit and "go" of any dozen of his
countrymen: what more could possibly be said? At the same time he had the
gentleness of a child. He recalled to mind one of those characters that
some of us have met, and in strange situations--situations and hours when
men's spirits were on fire, and when the air was filled with sounds that
once to hear is never to forget. One such is recalled by memory now--a
vision of a lithe and active figure that had come its longest marches,
and borne the many hardships of the many nights and days, though looking
frail as a girl in her teens, and with manner always gentle as a child.
For one like that to be amidst such doings as these seemed incongruous.
Yet had the estimate proved in the end quite false. Breeding and
pluck--nervous energy--had carried through, when others had gone down.
And the pluck and the breeding showed itself still, when the blood
dripped, and ebbed away, and the face was white as a stone.

Nor is such a parallel as far fetched as might at first appear. Given the
two, the dog and the man, this dog was to show before the end
characteristics equally striking and of scarcely less charm. To bear pain
is not easy. There is no longer doubt that men feel pain in varying
degrees, and that sufferings that might be considered identical are
multiplied tenfold in the case of a highly developed organisation. With
the high intelligence and nervous development of this dog, it might have
been thought that pain would terrify. If so, he never showed it.

It is unnecessary here to refer to the many instances when his dash and
high spirit brought about an accident, for all our dogs get into trouble
and meet with accidents at times--at least, those of any worth. But it
was this dog's further habit to avoid, when in pain, the company of the
one he loved best, and to go invariably to a woman for aid. It was as
much as to say that he knew that many men were in such cases worse than
useless: a thrust in this instance not without its truth. Thus he came
home two miles one night in snow, with both fore-feet cut right across
with glass--due to a dash at a rat in some rushes on the frozen
riverbank. To his master's eternal shame he never found it out. But, on
arriving home, this dog went straight off for attention, of his own
accord, and bore what he had to bear, not only without a flinch, but
showing his gratitude by licking the hand that was tending him. So again,
when he was once badly stubbed, he went to the same quarter, showed his
foot, and then lay down, staying perfectly quiet while a spike was looked
for, at last found, and then pulled out with a pair of iron pincers.

These are trivialities, no doubt; but they would not be trivialities to
some of Us. Some time had elapsed, as we have seen, before the Iroquois
discovered Villemarie; but at length ten fugitive Algonquins, chased by a
party of them, made for the friendly settlement as a safe asylum; and thus
their astonished pursuers became aware of its existence. They reconnoitred
the place, and went back to their towns with the news. [ Dollier
de Casson, MS. ] From that time forth the colonists had no peace;
no more excursions for fishing and hunting; no more Sunday strolls
in woods and meadows.

           The men went armed to their work, and returned at
           the sound of a bell, marching in a compact body,
           prepared for an attack.
           
           Early in June, 1643, sixty Hurons came down in canoes for traffic,
and, on reaching the place now called Lachine, at the head of the
rapids of St.

                                    Louis, and a few miles above Villemarie, they were amazed at finding
a large Iroquois war-party in a fort hastily built of the trunks
and boughs of trees.

Surprise and fright seem to have infatuated them.
They neither fought nor fled, but greeted their inveterate foes as if
they were friends and allies, and, to gain their good graces, told them
all they knew of the French settlement, urging them to attack it, and
promising an easy victory. Accordingly, the Iroquois detached forty
of their warriors, who surprised six Frenchmen at work hewing timber
within a gunshot of the fort, killed three of them, took the remaining
three prisoners, and returned in triumph. The captives were bound with the
usual rigor; and the Hurons taunted and insulted them, to please
their dangerous companions.

Their baseness availed them little; for at night, after a feast of victory,
when the Hurons were asleep or off their guard, their entertainers fell
upon them, and killed or captured the greater part. The rest ran for
Villemarie, where, as their treachery was as yet unknown, they were received
with great kindness.

[ I have followed Dollier de Casson. Vimont's account is different.
He says that the Iroquois fell upon the Hurons at the outset, and took
twenty-three prisoners, killing many others; after which they made the
attack at Villemarie.--Relation, 1643, 62.

Faillon thinks that Vimont was unwilling to publish the treachery of the
Hurons, lest the interests of the Huron mission should suffer in
consequence.

Belmont, Histoire du Canada, 1643, confirms the account of the Huron
treachery. ]
The next morning the Iroquois decamped, carrying with them their prisoners,
and the furs plundered from the Huron canoes. They had taken also, and
probably destroyed, all the letters from the missionaries in the Huron
country, as well as a copy of their Relation of the preceding year.
Of the three French prisoners, one escaped and reached Montreal; the
remaining two were burned alive.

At Villemarie it was usually dangerous to pass beyond the ditch of the
fort or the palisades of the hospital. Sometimes a solitary warrior would
lie hidden for days, without sleep and almost without food,
behind a log in the forest, or in a dense thicket, watching like a
lynx for some rash straggler. Sometimes parties of a hundred or more made
ambuscades near by, and sent a few of their number to lure out the
soldiers by a petty attack and a flight. The danger was much diminished,
however, when the colonists received from France a number of dogs, which
proved most efficient sentinels and scouts.

Of the instinct of these animals the writers of the time speak with
astonishment. Chief among them was a bitch named Pilot, who every morning
made the rounds of the forests and fields about the fort, followed by a
troop of her offspring. If one of them lagged behind, she hit him to
remind him of his duty; and if any skulked and ran home, she punished
them severely in the same manner on her return. When she discovered the
Iroquois, which she was sure to do by the scents if any were near,
she barked furiously, and ran at once straight to the fort, followed
by the rest.

The Jesuit chronicler adds, with an amusing naivete, that, while this
was her duty, "her natural inclination was for hunting squirrels."
[ Lalemant, Relation, 1647, 74, 75. "Son attrait naturel estoit
la chasse aux ecurieux." Dollier de Casson also speaks admiringly
of her and her instinct. Faillon sees in it a manifest proof of the
protecting care of God over Villemarie. ]
Maisonneuve was as brave a knight of the cross as ever fought in Palestine
for the sepulchre of Christ; but he could temper his valor with
discretion.

He knew that he and his soldiers were but indifferent woodsmen; that
their crafty foe had no equal in ambuscades and surprises; and that,
while a defeat might ruin the French, it would only exasperate an enemy
whose resources in men were incomparably greater. Therefore, when the
dogs sounded the alarm, he kept his followers close, and stood patiently
on the defensive. They chafed under this Fabian policy, and at length
imputed it to cowardice. Their murmurings grew louder, till they
reached the ear of Maisonneuve. The religion which animated him had not
destroyed the soldierly pride which takes root so readily and so
strongly in a manly nature; and an imputation of cowardice from
his own soldiers stung him to the quick.

He saw, too, that such an opinion of him must needs weaken his authority,
and impair the discipline essential to the safety of the
colony.

On the morning of the thirtieth of March, Pilot was heard barking with
unusual fury in the forest eastward from the fort; and in a few moments
they saw her running over the clearing, where the snow was still deep,
followed by her brood, all giving tongue together. The excited Frenchmen
flocked about their commander.

"Monsieur, les ennemis sont dans le bois; ne les irons-nous jamais
voir?" [ Dollier de Casson, MS. ]
Maisonneuve, habitually composed and calm, answered sharply,--
"Yes, you shall see the enemy. Get yourselves ready at once, and take care
that you are as brave as you profess to be. I shall lead you myself."
All was bustle in the fort. Guns were loaded, pouches filled, and snow-shoes
tied on by those who had them and knew how to use them.

There were not enough, however, and many were forced to go without them.
When all was ready, Maisonneuve sallied forth at the head of thirty
men, leaving d'Ailleboust, with the remainder, to hold the fort.
They crossed the snowy clearing and entered the forest, where all was
silent as the grave. They pushed on, wading through the deep snow,
with the countless pitfalls hidden beneath it, when suddenly they
were greeted with the screeches of eighty Iroquois, [ 1 ] who sprang up
from their lurking- places, and showered bullets and arrows upon
the advancing French.
The emergency called, not for chivalry, but for woodcraft; and Maisonneuve
ordered his men to take shelter, like their assailants, behind
trees. They stood their ground resolutely for a long time; but the
Iroquois pressed them close, three of their number were killed,
others were wounded, and their ammunition began to fail.

Their only alternatives were destruction or retreat; and to retreat
was not easy.
The order was given. Though steady at first, the men soon became confused,
and over-eager to escape the galling fire which the Iroquois sent after
them. Maisonneuve directed them towards a sledge-track which had been
used in dragging timber for building the hospital, and where the snow
was firm beneath the foot. He himself remained to the last, encouraging
his followers and aiding the wounded to escape. The French, as they
struggled through the snow, faced about from time to time, and fired
back to check the pursuit; but no sooner had they reached the sledge-track
than they gave way to their terror, and ran in a body for the fort.
Those within, seeing this confused rush of men from the distance,
mistook them for the enemy; and an over-zealous soldier touched the
match to a cannon which had been pointed to rake the sledge-track.

Had not the piece missed fire, from dampness of the priming, he would
have done more execution at one shot than the Iroquois in all the
fight of that morning

.

[ 1 Vimont, Relation, 1644, 42. Dollier de Casson says two hundred, but it
is usually safe in these cases to accept the smaller number, and Vimont
founds his statement on the information of an escaped prisoner. ]
Maisonneuve was left alone, retreating backwards down the track, and
holding his pursuers in check, with a pistol in each hand. They might
easily have shot him; but, recognizing him as the commander of the
French, they were bent on taking him alive. Their chief coveted this
honor for himself, and his followers held aloof to give him the
opportunity.
He pressed close upon Maisonneuve, who snapped a pistol at him,
which missed fire.

The Iroquois, who had ducked to avoid the shot, rose erect, and sprang
forward to seize him, when Maisonneuve, with his remaining pistol, shot
him dead. Then ensued a curious spectacle, not infrequent in Indian
battles. The Iroquois seemed to forget their enemy, in their anxiety
to secure and carry off the body of their chief; and the French
commander continued his retreat unmolested, till he was safe under
the cannon of the fort.

From that day, he was a hero in the eyes of his men.

[ Dollier de Casson, MS. Vimont's mention of the affair is brief.
He says that two Frenchmen were made prisoners, and burned. Belmont,
Histoire du Canada, 1645, gives a succinct account of the fight, and
indicates the scene of it. It seems to have been a little below
the site of the Place d'Armes, on which stands the great Parish Church
of Villemarie, commonly known to tourists as the "Cathedral." Faillon
thinks that Maisonneuve's exploit was achieved on this very spot.

Marguerite Bourgeoys also describes the affair in her unpublished writings.

Quebec and Montreal are happy in their founders. Samuel de Champlain and
Chomedey de Maisonneuve are among the names that shine with a fair
and honest lustre on the infancy of nations.

1644, 1645.

PEACE.

IROQUOIS PRISONERS.--PISKARET.--HIS EXPLOITS.--MORE PRISONERS.-- IROQUOIS
EMBASSY.--THE ORATOR.

--THE GREAT COUNCIL.-- SPEECHES OF KIOTSATON.--MUSTER OF SAVAGES.--PEACE
CONFIRMED.

In the damp and freshness of a midsummer morning, when the sun had not yet
risen, but when the river and the sky were red with the glory of approaching
day, the inmates of the fort at Three Rivers were roused by a
tumult of joyous and exultant voices. They thronged to the shore,-- priests,
soldiers, traders, and officers, mingled with warriors and shrill-voiced
squaws from Huron and Algonquin camps in the neighboring forest.

Close at hand they saw twelve or fifteen canoes slowly drifting down the
current of the St. Lawrence, manned by eighty young Indians, all
singing their songs of victory, and striking their paddles against the
edges of their bark vessels in cadence with their voices. Among them
three Iroquois prisoners stood upright, singing loud and defiantly, as men
not fearing torture or death.

A few days before, these young warriors, in part Huron and in part Algonquin,
had gone out on the war-path to the River Richelieu, where they
had presently found themselves entangled among several bands of
Iroquois.

They withdrew in the night, after a battle in the dark with an Iroquois
canoe, and, as they approached Fort Richelieu, had the good fortune to
discover ten of their enemy ambuscaded in a clump of bushes and
fallen trees, watching to waylay some of the soldiers on their
morning visit to the fishing-nets in the river hard by. They
captured three of them, and carried them back in triumph.

The victors landed amid screams of exultation. Two of the prisoners were
assigned to the Hurons, and the third to the Algonquins, who immediately
took him to their lodges near the fort at Three Rivers, and began the
usual "caress," by burning his feet with red-hot stones, and cutting off
his fingers. Champfleur, the commandant, went out to them with urgent
remonstrances, and at length prevailed on them to leave their victim without
further injury, until Montmagny, the Governor, should arrive.
He came with all dispatch,--not wholly from a motive of humanity, but
partly in the hope that the three captives might be made instrumental
in concluding a peace with their countrymen.

A council was held in the fort at Three Rivers. Montmagny made
valuable presents to the Algonquins and the Hurons, to induce them to
place the prisoners in his hands.

The Algonquins complied; and the unfortunate Iroquois, gashed, maimed, and
scorched, was given up to the French, who treated him with the
greatest kindness. But neither the Governor's gifts nor his eloquence
could persuade the Hurons to follow the example of their allies; and
they departed for their own country with their two captives,--promising,
however, not to burn them, but to use them for negotiations of peace.
With this pledge, scarcely worth the breath that uttered it, Montmagny
was forced to content himself. [ Vimont, Relation, 1644, 45-49. ]
Thus it appeared that the fortune of war did not always smile even on the
Iroquois.

Indeed, if there is faith in Indian tradition, there had been a time,
scarcely half a century past, when the Mohawks, perhaps the fiercest and
haughtiest of the confederate nations, had been nearly destroyed by the
Algonquins, whom they now held in contempt. [ 1 ] This people, whose
inferiority arose chiefly from the want of that compact organization
in which lay the strength of the Iroquois, had not lost their
ancient warlike spirit; and they had one champion of whom even the
audacious confederates stood in awe.

His name was Piskaret; and he dwelt on that great island in the Ottawa of
which Le Borgne was chief.
He had lately turned Christian, in the hope of French favor and
countenance,--always useful to an ambitious Indian,--and perhaps, too,
with an eye to the gun and powder-horn which formed the earthly reward of
the convert. [ 2 ] Tradition tells marvellous stories of his
exploits.

Once, it is said, he entered an Iroquois town on a dark night. His
first care was to seek out a hiding-place, and he soon found one
in the midst of a large wood-pile. [ 3 ] Next he crept into a lodge,
and, finding the inmates asleep, killed them with his war-club,
took their scalps, and quietly withdrew to the retreat he had
prepared.

In the morning a howl of lamentation and fury rose from the astonished
villagers. They ranged the fields and forests in vain pursuit of the
mysterious enemy, who remained all day in the wood-pile, whence,
at midnight, he came forth and repeated his former exploit.

                 On the third night, every family placed its sentinels; and Piskaret,
stealthily creeping from lodge to lodge, and reconnoitring each
through crevices in the bark, saw watchers everywhere.

                                   At length he descried a sentinel who had fallen asleep near the
entrance of a lodge, though his companion at the other end was still
awake and vigilant.

He pushed aside the sheet of bark that served as a door, struck the sleeper
a deadly blow, yelled his war-cry, and fled like the wind. All the village
swarmed out in furious chase; but Piskaret was the swiftest runner of his
time, and easily kept in advance of his pursuers.
When daylight came, he showed himself from time to time to lure them on,
then yelled defiance, and distanced them again. At night, all but six
had given over the chase; and even these, exhausted as they were,
had begun to despair.

Piskaret, seeing a hollow tree, crept into it like a bear, and hid himself;
while the Iroquois, losing his traces in the dark, lay down to
sleep near by.

At midnight he emerged from his retreat, stealthily approached his slumbering
enemies, nimbly brained them all with his war-club, and then,
burdened with a goodly bundle of scalps, journeyed homeward in triumph.
[ 4 ]
[ 1 Relation, 1660, 6 (anonymous).

Both Parrot and La Potherie recount traditions of the ancient superiority
of the Algonquins over the Iroquois, who formerly, it is said, dwelt
near Montreal and Three Rivers, whence the Algonquins expelled them.
They withdrew, first to the neighborhood of Lake Erie, then to
that of Lake Ontario, their historic seat. There is much to support
the conjecture that the Indians found by Cartier at Montreal in
1535 were Iroquois (See "Pioneers of France," 189.)

That they belonged to the same family of tribes is certain. For the
traditions alluded to, see Perrot, 9, 12, 79, and La Potherie, I.
288-295. ]
[ 2 "Simon Pieskaret . . . n'estoit Chrestien qu'en apparence et par
police."--Lalemant, Relation, 1647, 68.--He afterwards became a convert
in earnest. ]
[ 3 Both the Iroquois and the Hurons collected great quantities of wood
in their villages in the autumn. ]
[ 4 This story is told by La Potherie, I. 299, and, more briefly,
by Perrot, 107.

La Potherie, writing more than half a century after the time in question,
represents the Iroquois as habitually in awe of the Algonquins. In this
all the contemporary writers contradict him. ]
This is but one of several stories that tradition has preserved of his
exploits; and, with all reasonable allowances, it is certain that
the crafty and valiant Algonquin was the model of an Indian
warrior. That which follows rests on a far safer basis.

Early in the spring of 1645, Piskaret, with six other converted
Indians, some of them better Christians than he, set out on a war-party,
and, after dragging their canoes over the frozen St. Lawrence, launched
them on the open stream of the Richelieu.

They ascended to Lake Champlain, and hid themselves in the leafless
forests of a large island, watching patiently for their human prey. One
day they heard a distant shot.

"Come, friends," said Piskaret, "let us get our dinner: perhaps it
will be the last, for we must dine before we run." Having dined to their
contentment, the philosophic warriors prepared for action.

One of them went to reconnoitre, and soon reported that two canoes full
of Iroquois were approaching the island. Piskaret and his followers
crouched in the bushes at the point for which the canoes were making,
and, as the foremost drew near, each chose his mark, and fired with
such good effect that, of seven warriors, all but one were killed.
The survivor jumped overboard, and swam for the other canoe, where
he was taken in. It now contained eight Iroquois, who, far from
attempting to escape, paddled in haste for a distant part of the
shore, in order to land, give battle, and avenge their slain comrades.
But the Algonquins, running through the woods, reached the landing
before them, and, as one of them rose to fire, they shot him. In
his fall he overset the canoe.Murphy was the best off of the party, save
when something had drawn him from beneath the waggon, and he was having a
game with the snow on his own account. Great wreaths hung to the fences,
or stood out in ledges where the banks were high. The sky, or rather the
whole air, was lead colour, and all distance was blotted out. Flocks of
crazy, distracted birds flew close by in great numbers, for the most part
finches and larks, with here and there a fieldfare or two, their breasts
and underwings buff colour. Then came a flight wholly made up of
buntings, whose brilliant yellows looked deep orange against the leaden
grey that shrouded all.

There was no end to the great host. They were all going one way: they
made no sound but the swish of wings, and uttered no single note: they
passed at speed as though in fear, yet all the while in obedience to the
supremest law of all. To the southward there would be protection; life
there would be preserved: here it was impossible--for birds. "Keep low;
press on!" Victory shall be to the strongest: the weak shall fall in this
pitiless wind, and the snow shall cover the dead, but in the end there
shall be a better life for some. "Keep low; press on!"

There was something weird in such a sight as that: there was something
weird also in the sound of the wind. It came sweeping over the fields,
tearing with angry gusts at the snow-laden briars in the fences, and
passing on with a moaning sound into the dark of the approaching night.

There was no sign of human beings anywhere. Familiar objects had all
changed their character, though it was only by these that whereabouts
could be told. The remains of a hay-rick by the roadside suddenly showed
up out of the mirk, with white top like some great ghost, its blackened
sides flecked here and there with snow. In the hot days of June two here
had seen it built; and, later on, watched the trussers at work on it,
when the price of hay had gone up, and farmers could make a few pounds.
But that job, like most others, had had to be abandoned now.

Why, here was the great stoggle oak by the pool, on whose limbs in former
times, tradition had it, many a highwayman had swung! The storm to it was
nothing: it had weathered so many: the world was a fair place; but life
was full of tests as well as trials. "Heads up! Bear yourselves like
men," its limbs seemed to roar in solemn, deep diapason. "Heads
up!--there is a haven for all ahead!"

It was fifty yards further on before the voice of the oak was lost. But
as man and dog worked further still, for very joy of the wind and the
snow and love for the elements at their worst--the horses struggling, the
waggoners calling to them loudly and urging them to put their best into
it, with many a crack of the whip--there suddenly fell a lull, and for a
moment there was peace. And just then, up from the valley, there came
other sounds--the larch and the firs down there were sighing out a tune
to themselves, being partly sheltered by the hill.

It was time to turn back. There was a lane in the direction of those last
sounds: home could easily be reached that way, and, likely enough, with
the set of the wind, the roadway itself would have been swept almost
bare.

The waggons were lost to sight in a moment, though the woody rattle of
the axles could still be heard: snow was falling heavily again: the cold
was becoming intense: the wind was now dropping altogether. A dead bird
or two were passed, lying in the snow, claws in air and already stiff: a
felt and a yellowhammer were side by side at the bottom of the hill. It
was like the dead in gay uniforms, lying scattered after an action. A
little further on there was a blackbird, to Murphy's very evident glee.
He found it at once, and was for carrying it home; it was still warm. But
this was no time for fooling. It was already dark and growing darker; the
proper thing to do was to keep together and make for home. Travelling was
none too easy, even for tall men, and really difficult for dogs in
places.

At points where field gates opened on to the road, drifts had formed two
feet in depth, right across the way, and it was necessary to pick up the
dog and carry him, though to the latter's thinking that was a silly thing
to do. Time was, when his master had had to do that; but he had then been
no better than a child in arms. Now he was a man, and had come to man's
estate, and, furthermore, had learnt what life was, with its hours full
of health, and crammed with fresh adventures and experiences, as, of
course, it should be. His muscles were hard and flexible as steel, his
heart strong with life, his brain quick to learn whatsoever his master
thought best that he should know. Health, strength, what happiness it all
was! The neighbourhood of those waggons had been rather depressing, and
the crack of those whips somewhat disconcerting; but he did not stop to
reason why. It was enough that he and his master were together. The past
might look after itself, and so might the future; this was the
all-sufficient present.

Around Sainte Marie the forests were gray and bare, and, in the cornfields
over the naked forest towards the south-east, about three miles distant.
They looked at swarm, beside themselves with rage, turned towards St forest

the war-path for the Hurons. hunting for subsistence and moving at their
leisure towards their prey. The destruction among of the two towns we

undiscovered. Common vigilance and common sense would have averted,

of the Tobacco Nation. Here, when they arrived, they spread at a universal
panic. Ragueneau, Bressani, and their companions waited in suspense at
Sainte Marie.

On one hand, they trembled for Brebeuf and Lalemant; on the other, they
looked hourly for an attack: and when at evening they kept saw the
Iroquois scouts prowling along forest, of the invaders. They stood guard

CHAPTER XXIX. 1649, 1650. THE SANCTUARY. DISPERSION OF THE HURONS.
By
the Parsees, for instance, he is not regarded as wholly unclean. Many of
them keep English-bred dogs, as also do some of the more Europeanised
natives of other classes, treating them much as we do, though this is
still uncommon. Hindus of good class and Mahomedans are found generally
to avoid them; but here again many Hindus, and such a caste as Sweepers,
will touch a dog without considering themselves defiled, just as a
Mahomedan will often hold or take charge of a dog, though he be careful
not to do so by the chain, or leather lead, but by slipping his _jharan_,
or cloth, through the dog's collar, and handling him that way. In many
Mahomedan villages the dog is found in numbers, the inhabitants being
glad of his services in shepherding their goats, though condemning him to
live outside the house, even though there be likelihood of his being
carried off by a prowling leopard.

In certain directions, therefore, the dog is seen to be at least
tolerated. But there remains one other remarkable fact to be noted. No
one can have travelled in the East, especially in Turkey, without
remarking the way in which the dog is generally regarded. Yet, in spite
of this, he is all the while certainly classed as supernatural, and by no
less an authority than the Koran. His uncleanness must be recognised;
but, on the other hand, how are his fidelity and courage to be
overlooked? They cannot be. And so this unclean animal, from whom men
shrink, lest by chance their garments touch him as they pass, is given,
as already related, a position in Mahomed's paradise, and, because of his
character, is deemed worthy a special place in that land of supreme
bliss. There is a chance, then, for the outcast here.

                    *       *       *       *       *

It is time to look at the dog himself a little closer, and see what
characteristics he can bring forward in support of hopes that many human
beings entertain on his behalf.

Here is a dumb animal that, long before the dawn of history, is known to
have been man's close companion. Step by step, we see him advancing with
those to whom he is linked, until he raises himself immeasurably above
all other animals, and takes his place pre-eminently as the friend of
man. No one of those from whom he originally sprang was known to bark,
and no wild species does so. By and through man, the dog was endowed with
this means of expression, and was thus able to act as his more efficient
guard. It is an established fact that the dog barks when in contact with
man, and loses the power when separated from him. Sometimes calm years

Afterwards, when the fervor and freshness of the missions had passed
away, they frequently did the work of political agents among the Indians:
but the Jesuit of the earlier period was, with rare exceptions, a missionary
only; and though he was expected to exert a powerful influence in gaining
subjects and allies for France, he was to do so by gathering them under
the wings of the Church.

The Colony of Massachusetts had applied to the French officials at
Quebec, with a view to a reciprocity of trade. The Iroquois had brought
Canada to extremity, and the French Governor conceived the hope
of gaining the powerful support of New England by granting the
desired privileges on condition of military aid. But, as the Puritans
would scarcely see it for their interest to provoke a dangerous enemy, who
had thus far never molested them, it was resolved to urge the proposed
alliance as a point of duty. The Abenaquis had suffered from Mohawk
inroads; and the French, assuming for the occasion that they were under
the jurisdiction of the English colonies, argued that they were bound
to protect them.
Druilletes went in a double character,--as an envoy of the government
at Quebec, and as an agent of his Abenaqui flock, who had been advised to
petition for English assistance.

The time seemed inauspicious for a Jesuit visit to Boston; for not only
had it been announced as foremost among the objects in colonizing
New England, "to raise a bulwark against the kingdom of Antichrist,
which the Jesuits labor to rear up in all places of the world," [ 1
] but, three years before, the Legislature of Massachusetts had
enacted, that Jesuits entering the colony should be expelled, and if they
returned, hanged. [ 2 ]

his marvellous instinct, man is not infrequently struck dumb as he
watches. A dog's patience is a thing to study, as well as one from which
to learn many a fair lesson. His pluck and courage are almost proverbial.
In many a case the odds against him seem not to make the slightest
difference: he will fight on to the end; let his master only lead, he
will follow to the death.

And it is here that his fidelity attains its very pinnacle. Faithful unto
death! Again and again, in innumerable instances, he has shown his
faithfulness long after the one he loved was dead. The dog in the
mediæval legend that dug his master's grave, covered him with moss and
leaves, and then watched there for seven years, until he died himself,

Yet when we look back, and ask ourselves, "Are all these for naught?" is
