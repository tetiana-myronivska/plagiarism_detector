unable to escape, he died in great agony."

Mrs. Clifford smiled, but made no reply to his exclamations of
surprise, and went on as if she had not heard him. "In this quiet
pretty spot they settled themselves, and Downy hoped to spend the rest
of her days in quiet; she wanted for nothing, for Velvet provided for
all her wants. Downy thought, if she should ever be deprived of her,
it would break her heart, and she must soon be starved to death, as
she could not work now, as she had done formerly. These thoughts made
her often very sorrowful, and Velvet thought she seemed to droop, and
lose her spirits and appetite, so Velvet thought to get something nice
to please her; she stole into the house one day, when nobody saw her,
and after some little time, she found her way into the cupboard, where
she smelt something very nice, and beheld a new plum-cake. 'Ah!' said
she, 'how my sick mother will like a bit of this cake!' The man whose
happiness is constituted by the society of one amiable woman
would find some difficulty in sympathizing with the disappointment
of this venerable debauchee.

I address myself not only to the young enthusiast, the ardent devotee
of truth and virtue, the pure and passionate moralist, yet unvitiated
by the contagion of the world. He will embrace a pure system, from its
abstract truth, its beauty, its simplicity, and its promise of
wide-extended benefit; unless custom has turned poison into food,
he will hate the brutal pleasures of the chase by instinct; it will
be a contemplation full of horror, and disappointment to his mind,
that beings capable of the gentlest and most admirable sympathies
should take delight in the death-pangs and last convulsions of dying
animals.

"Yes, if you please, mamma, but you don't know any more of it, do
you?" "Only this, when Downy found Velvet did not return, she died of
grief. Thus ended the LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF THE FIELD-MOUSE."
