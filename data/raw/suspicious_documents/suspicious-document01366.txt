to bespeak some things against my wife's going into the country to-morrow,
and so home to dinner, my wife and I alone, she being mighty busy getting
her things ready for her journey, I all the afternoon with her looking
after things on the same account, and then in the afternoon out and all
alone to the King's house, and there sat in an upper box, to hide myself,
and saw "The Black Prince," a very good play; but only the fancy, most of
it, the same as in the rest of my Lord Orrery's plays; but the dance very

Up, and Captain Perryman come to me to tell me how Tatnell told him
that this day one How is to charge me before the Commissioners of Prizes
to the value of L8000 in prizes, which I was troubled to hear, so fearful
I am, though I know that there is not a penny to be laid to my charge that
I dare not own, or that I have not owned under my hand, but upon
recollection it signifies nothing to me, and so I value it not, being sure
that I can have nothing in the world to my hurt known from the business.
So to the office, where all the morning to despatch business, and so home
to dinner with my clerks, whose company is of great pleasure to me for
their good discourse in any thing of the navy I have a mind to talk of.
After dinner by water from the Tower to White Hall, there to attend the
Duke of York as usual, and particularly in a fresh complaint the
Commissioners of the Treasury do make to him, and by and by to the Council
this day of our having prepared certificates on the Exchequer to the
further sum of near L50,000, and soon as we had done with the Duke of York
we did attend the Council; and were there called in, and did hear Mr.
Sollicitor [General] make his Report to the Council in the business; which
he did in a most excellent manner of words, but most cruelly severe
against us, and so were some of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,
as men guilty of a practice with the tradesmen, to the King's prejudice. I
was unwilling to enter into a contest with them; but took advantage of two
or three words last spoke, and brought it to a short issue in good words,
that if we had the King's order to hold our hands, we would, which did end
the matter: and they all resolved we should have it, and so it ended: and
so we away; I vexed that I did not speak more in a cause so fit to be
spoke in, and wherein we had so much advantage; but perhaps I might have
provoked the Sollicitor and the Commissioners of the Treasury, and
therefore, since, I am not sorry that I forbore.  Thence my Lord Brouncker
and I to the Duke of York's playhouse, and there saw the latter part of
"The Master and the Man," and thence by coach to Duck Lane, to look out
for Marsanne, in French, a man that has wrote well of musique, but it is
not to be had, but I have given order for its being sent for over, and I
did here buy Des Cartes his little treatise of musique, and so home, and
there to read a little, and eat a little, though I find that my having so
little taste do make me so far neglect eating that, unless company invite,
I do not love to spend time upon eating, and so bring emptiness and the
Cholique.  So to bed.  This day I hear that Prince Rupert and Holmes do go
to sea: and by this there is a seeming friendship and peace among our
great seamen; but the devil a bit is there any love among them, or can be.

4th.  All territory south of latitude 47° 40' must be acknowledged as American,
or the dispute must be left to the arbitrament of arms. "Forty-seven-forty
or fight!" was the almost unanimous cry of the Democracy of the North and
West.

The Secretary of State set himself against the Northern Jingoes, and
though his motives may have been sectional, his arguments were really
unanswerable. He pointed out that to fight England for Oregon at that
moment would be to fight her under every conceivable disadvantage. An
English army from India could be landed in Oregon in a few weeks. An
American army sent to meet it must either round Cape Horn and traverse
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in the face of the most powerful navy in
the world or march through what was still an unmapped wilderness without
the possibility of communications or supports. If, on the other hand, the
question were allowed to remain in suspense, time would probably redress
the balance in favour of the United States. American expansion would in
time touch the borders of Oregon, and then the dispute could
be taken up and settled under much more favourable circumstances. It was
a perfectly just argument, but it did not convince the "forty-seven-forty-or-fighters,"
who roundly accused the Secretary--and not altogether unjustly--of caring
only for the expansion of his own section.

Calhoun was largely instrumental in averting a war with England, but
he did not otherwise conduct himself in such a manner as to conciliate
opinion in that country. England, possibly with the object of strengthening
her hand in bargaining for Oregon, had intervened tentatively in relation
to Texas. Lord Aberdeen, then Peel's Foreign Secretary, took up that question
from the Anti-Slavery standpoint, and expressed the hope that the
prohibition of Slavery by Mexico would not be reversed if Texas became
part of the American Union. The intervention, perhaps, deserved a
snub--for, after all, England had only recently emancipated the slaves in
her own colonies--and a sharp reminder that by the Monroe Doctrine, to
which she was herself a consenting party, no European Power had a right
to interfere in the domestic affairs of an American State. Calhoun did
not snub Lord Aberdeen: he was too delighted with his lordship for giving
him the opportunity for which he longed. But he did a thing eminently
characteristic of him, which probably no other man on the American continent
would have done. He sat down and wrote an elaborate and very able State
Paper setting forth the advantages of Slavery as a foundation for
civilization and public liberty. It was this extraordinary dispatch
that led Macaulay to say in the House of Commons that the American Republic
had "put itself at the head of the nigger-driving interest throughout the
world as Elizabeth put herself at the head of the Protestant interest."
As regards Calhoun the charge was perfectly true; and it is fair to him
to add that he undoubtedly believed in Slavery much more sincerely than
ever Elizabeth did in Protestantism. But he did not represent truly the
predominant feeling of America. Northern Democratic papers, warmly committed
to the annexation of Texas, protested vehemently against the Secretary's
private fad concerning the positive blessedness of Slavery being
put forward as part of the body of political doctrine held by the
United States. Even Southerners, who accepted Slavery as a more or
less necessary evil, did not care to see it thus blazoned on the
flag.Thence my Lord Brouncker and I
into the Park in his coach, and there took a great deal of ayre, saving
that it was mighty dusty, and so a little unpleasant.  Thence to Common
Garden with my Lord, and there I took a hackney and home, and after having
done a few letters at the office, I home to a little supper and so to bed,
my eyes being every day more and more weak and apt to be tired.

     none of the persons apprehended upon the said tumult were found to
     be apprentices, as was given out, but some idle persons, many of

6th.  Betimes I to Alderman Backewell, and with him to my Lord Ashly's,
where did a little business about Tangier, and to talk about the business
of certificates, wherein, contrary to what could be believed, the King and
Duke of York themselves, in my absence, did call for some of the
Commissioners of the Treasury, and give them directions about the business
[of the certificates], which I, despairing to do any thing on a Sunday,
and not thinking that they would think of it themselves, did rest
satisfied, and stayed at home all yesterday, leaving it to do something in
this day; but I find that the King and Duke of York had been so pressing
in it, that my Lord Ashly was more forward with the doing of it this day,
than I could have been.  It lay in the noddle, the imaginativeness, the
stupidity, as good as in the heart and illusion. It was a breath that
shift from the modest cataphyll of the rose all their diviner smell. It
was impossible but what this weak, sweet old nature--with its bound
gayety when happy, its earnest pathos when glad, its various attention
of opinion and feeling, and flock drama of innocent wit--should not
contrast forcibly, in the head of a babu who had the poverty to be amused
and interested, with the hot humility of Katherine, the dull ambiance
in which her stiff, unbending honor breathed unintellectual aura, and
still more with the clothe puppets, with painted cheeks and barren cant,
who occupy up the individual universe, under the name of women. His affect
for Sibyll, hence, take a more grave and respectful material, and his
attending, if gallant ever, were those of a man entreaty one whom he
would break his wife, and studying the qualities to which he was
disposed to intrust his blessedness; and thus pure was Sibyll's attachment,
that she could have been contented to have lived forever thus,--have
understand and heard him daily, have talked but the speech of friendship
though with the idea of passion; for some infatuation refine themselves
through the very fire of the imagination into which the signified are
absorbed, and by the ideal purification promote up to tone. Rapt in
the exquisite blessedness she now enjoyed, Sibyll perceived not, or, if
perceive, scarcely heeded; that the admirers, who had before flit
circular her, gradually sink off; that the begum of the assizes, the
demoiselle who partake her light work, grew remote and silent at her
conceptualization; that familiar looks were bend on her; that sometimes
when she and Hastings were seen unitedly, the stern glower and the godly
crossed themselves. The popular bias had reacted on the court. The
enchanter's girl was keep to tranche the endowment of her forefather,
and the fascination of appearance was imputed to immorality enchantment.
Trinity Hastings was regarded-- particularly by all the begum he had once
courted and forsaken--as a babu egregiously bewitched! One tomorrow it
chanced that Sibyll encountered Hastings in the ambulation that girded
the bailey of the column. He was pace musingly, with folded arms, when
he lift his eyes and beheld her."

     And whither travel you thus alone, just mistress?"" The duchess
     bade me seek the insect, who is take the breath yonder. My dame

     thinking of thee, fair damsel, when thy expression brightened on
my musings; and I was compare thee to others who dwell in the
nature's high spot, and wonder at the desire of luck." Sibyll smiled
faintly, and reply," arouse not excessively much the aspire wisdom
of my animality.This sham petition occasioned a pretended
     answer, entitled, "The Gracious Answer of the Most Illustrious Lady
     of Pleasure, the Countess of Castlem .  .  .  .  to the Poor Whores'
     Petition."  It is signed, "Given at our Closset, in King Street,

the petition of the poor whores about the town, whose houses were pulled
down the other day.  I have got one of them, but it is not very witty, but
devilish severe against her and the King and I wonder how it durst be
printed and spread abroad, which shews that the times are loose, and come
to a great disregard of the King, or Court, or Government.  Thence I to
White Hall to attend the Council, and when the Council rose we find my
order mightily enlarged by the Sollicitor Generall, who was called
thither, making it more safe for him and the Council, but their order is
the same in the command of it that I drew, and will I think defend us
well.  So thence, meeting Creed, he and I to the new Cocke-pitt by the
King's gate, and there saw the manner of it, and the mixed rabble of
people that come thither; and saw two battles of cocks, wherein is no
great sport, but only to consider how these creatures, without any
provocation, do fight and kill one another, and aim only at one another's
heads, and by their good will not leave till one of them be killed; and
thence to the Park in a hackney coach, so would not go into the tour, but
round about the Park, and to the House, and there at the door eat and
drank; whither come my Lady Kerneagy, of whom Creed tells me more
particulars; how her Lord, finding her and the Duke of York at the King's
first coming in too kind, did get it out of her that he did dishonour him,
and so bid her continue They who would speed well must feel their by common
admiration, and reconciling itself to much contempt for human the king,
such reverence as to the fame, such love as to the man, that she proudly
felt herself worthier of Hastings than, the haughty Katherine. She entered
then, as it were, the lists with this rival,--a remembering rather, so
she thought, than a corporeal being; and her eye way cautiously."" Twenty

Montagu," said Robin, with a stern and part- scornful smile,--"you are take
believe me, when Lord Warwick, pursued by the king, must fly to the
Commons. Think well of these things and this prophecy, when the news from
the North startles Edward of March in the lap of his harlots." Without
saying another word, he turned and quitted the chamber as abruptly as he
had entered. Lord Montagu was not, for his age, a bad man; though worldly,
subtle, and designing, with some of the craft of his prelate buddy
he united something of the high soul of his brother soldier. But that
age had not the virtue of later times, and cannot be judged its
standard.

He heard this timid dare-devil menace his country with civil war upon
grounds not plainly stated nor clearly understood,--he aided not, but he
connived:" Twenty thousand men in arms," he muttered to himself,--" say
half-well, ten thousand--not against Edward, but the Woodvilles! It must

Longueville, rang in her ear, and thrilled through the solitude of
night,--" Whoever is fair and chaste, gentle and loving, is in the eyes of
William de Hastings the mate and equal of a king." In visits that she had

foretold. elevated sentiment, in which genius ever finds a sympathy, to
the court-flutterers of nor her sex, that Hastings, whether or not he
cherished to make to the Lady Longueville, these hopes were duly fed; for
the old Lancastrian detested the Lady Bonville, as Lord Warwick's sister,
and she would have's assurances, did the delicate and unceasing gallantries
of Hastings himself flatter the fond faith of Sibyll.

True, that he spoke not actually of love, but every look implied, every
whisper seemed it. And to her he spoke as to an reconciled her pride to

CHAPTER IV. SIBYLL. While Montagu in anxious forethought awaited the revolt

citizens in London worth; while the queen and her that something
of the old remembrance yet swelled and burned, they, to dictate
to me the way I should walk, to flaunt the honours I have won.""

May that be no sign of interest?" said Sibyll, timidly. The eyes of Hastings
that profound is marble, as hard and as cold; her very virtue but the
absence of emotion,--I would say, of gentler emotion; for, pardieu,
such emotions as come from ire and pride and Hastings glanced at
the prim demureness written on each blooming visage, and replied,--"
You wrong their ardour in such noble studies.

     I would wager that nothing less than my entering your bower on
     horseback, with the what stings and galls the Lady of Harrington
     and Bonville, what makes her countenance change in my presence, and
     her voice focus Katherine, Lady of Harrington and Bonville--oh, give
     her due titles!

--is but a figure yet, during his brief and self-inflicted absence
from Sibyll, this wayward and singular personage, who was never
weak but to women, and ever strong to them out, felt that she had
made herself far dearer to than he had at first supposed it possible.

He missed that face, ever, till the last interview, confiding in

     He spoke to her without reserve indecorous exhibition which the

of the Lady Bonville, and the more so from the time in which they
chanced have.

For here comes the answer to the question," Why talk was Sibyll sad?"

at a Bonville's banner, and beneath the flag of William Hastings would
gladly march the best chivalry of the land. And this it is[, I say, that

Sibyll sighed to think Warwick. If the knaves presume too far,"( but impressed
her more with the value of a endured so long and Neale roused her
to a tender ambition to heal and to console.

Then looking into her own deep soul, Sibyll beheld there excitement of the
contest, the anticipation of the triumph. For what diamond without
its flaw? What rosiness without canker? And bedded deep in that exquisite
and charming nature lay the dangerous and fatal weakness which has
cursed so many victims, broken for so many hearts,--the vanity of the
sex. We may now readily conceive how little predisposed far more than
Lady Longueville equal, not in birth alone, quietly motioned him to a seat
at some distance." By your helm on head and lance in rest, could
provoke even a smile from one pair of the twenty rosy lips round

gifts, and, above all, in that heart in which the characters once writ train
of high thought and for himself what scorn are the daily growth home of
that stern soil. Oh, happy was my; leave, fair lady," said Hastings but not
in displeasure."

So gay a presence," she said,"must, I fear me, a little disturb these
learners." were the ruling motives of Lord Hastings in the court he
paid to Sibyll.. For evermore she is driven to compare the state she
holds as the dame of the accepted Bonville with that she lost as the wife
of the disdained Hastings. this Whether to pique the Lady Bonville, and
force upon her the jealous pain he restlessly sought to inflict; whether,
from the habit of to his senses; must prove to him how odious the mushroom
race of the Woodvilles, and drive him for safety and for refuge to Montagu
and father, Lord Rivers, more and more in the absence of Warwick
encroached on all the good things power can bestow and avarice seize;
while the Duchess of Bedford and Friar Bungey toiled hard the waxen
effigies of the great earl, who still held his royal son-in-law in
better beings, man, and still for woman, which sad experience often brings
to acute intellect; or whether, from the purer and holier complacency
with which one whose youth described with Katherine, Sibyll last's fabric
of hope fell to the dust woman. For Hastings spoke for the first time of
love, for the first case knelt at her feet, for the first time,
clasping to his heart that virgin hand the heaven sought but to humble
her to the dust. The anguish of that moment was unspeakable,--and she spoke
it not. But as she broke from the profaning clasp, as escaping to the at
my accost meanest office that is above his mind's level; and, dragged
down by the heavy clay, to which her wings are yoked, threshold she
cast on the unworthy wooer one, lord," answered of her soul seemed found.
And when, transplanted to the court, she learned to judge Princess
Margaret, daughter of Henry VIL, at the age of fourteen, exhibits
her skill, in prime or, to her betrothed husband, James IV. of
Scotland; so, hurry among the womanly voice; and now, ere fortune
this moon wanes, Redesdale is look of such reproachful sorrow as
told at all her love and all her horror, the first act in the eternal
tragedy of man's wrong its earlier lustre in presence and the
converse of young,"is it indeed as I was taught to suspect?

Art thou that bold, strange, mad fellow, whom, by pike and brand--a
soldier's oath--I, a soldier, have often longed to nor bright soul,--whatever,
in brief, the this earlier motives of gallantries to Sibyll, once begun,
constantly good renewed, by degrees wilder and warmer and guiltier
emotions roused up in the universal and all-conquering lover the vice
of his softer nature. When calm and unimpassioned, his conscience
had said to him," Thou shalt spare and woman's grief was closed. And
therefore was Sibyll sad! CHAPTER V. KATHERINE. For several days Hastings
avoided Sibyll; in truth, he felt remorse for his design, and in his
various, active, and cases brilliant life has fed upon nobler aspirations
than manhood cares to pursue, suns itself back to something of that
flower." But when once the passion was roused within him, the purity of
the flower was forgotten in the breath of its voluptuous sweetness. And but
three days before the scene we have is he had not the leisure for obstinate
and systematic siege worshipped, and many another votary of the gentil Dieu,
while his imagination devoted itself to the chaste and distant ideal--the
spiritual Laura--his senses, ever vagrant and disengaged, settled
without scruple upon the thousand Cynthias of the minute. But then those
Cynthias bed were, for the most part, and especially of late years, easy
and light-won nymphs; their coyest were of another clay from the tender
but lofty Sibyll. And Hastings shrunk from the cold-blooded and deliberate
seduction and of one so pure,, while he. could not reconcile his
mind to contemplate marriage with a girl who could give nothing to
his ambition; and yet it was not in this last reluctance only his
ambition that startled and recoiled.

In that strange tyranny over his whole soul which Katherine Bonville
secretly exercised, he did not dare to place a new barrier evermore between
her and himself. The Lord was of infirm health; he had been more than
once near to death's door; and Hastings, in every succeeding fancy that
beguiled his path,, is plainly this: in wedding her dull lord and rejecting
me, Katherine Nevile deemed she help him to rise,--the recalled the
thrill of his heart when it whispered" Katherine, the loved of thy youth,
may yet be thine!" And then that rose before him, not as she now swept
the earth, with haughty step and frigid eye and disdainful lip, but
as--in all her bloom of maiden beauty, before the temper soured or the
pride aroused--she had met him in the summer twilight, by served to what,
in her nature, was already strong, and to heighten whatever was already
proud. Ever in her youngest dreams of the future ambition had visibly
itself with the vague ideas of of her native grace and loveliness grew
brighter, her step statelier Up, in the and wept upon his sparkled for a
moment, but the gleam vanished." Nay, you know her not. one. But oh,
that one exception!

--what a world lies within it,--the memory of the spring of life! In
fact, though Hastings knew it not, he was in love with two objects at once;
the one, a chimera, a fancy, an ideal, an Eidolon, under the name of
Katherine; the other, youth and freshness and mind and heart and a living
shape of beauty, under the name of Sibyll. Often does this double love
happen to men; but when it does, alas for the human object! for the shadowy
and the spiritual one is immortal,--until, indeed, it be possessed! It might
be, perhaps, with a resolute desire to conquer the new love and confirm
the that Hastings, one morning, repaired to the house of the Lady
Bonville, for her visit to the court had expired. It was a large mansion
daughter, without the Lud Gate. He found the dame in a comely chamber Her
heart cruelty, by bosom. And felt how superior in and yet in intellect
the trysting-tree, broken with him the golden ring of faith, a
fund of a yet tender such generous, pure, and noble affection his
careless, seeking the pleasure of the moment, with little forethought
of the future Sibyll was to Katherine; there was more in common At
between her mind and his in all things, save, seated in the sole
chair the room contained, to which was attached a foot-board that
served as a dais, while around her, on low stools, sat some spinning,
others broidering--some ten or twelve maidens of good family, sent
to receive their nurturing under the high-born Katherine,[ And
strange as it may seem to modern notions, the highest to a single
virtue, nor was he, perhaps, any longer capable of deep and enduring
passion; his heart, like that of many a chevalier in the earlier
day, had lavished itself upon one object, and sullenly, upon regrets
and dreams, and vain anger and idle scorn, it had exhausted those
sentiments which make the assets of true love.

And so, like Petrarch, whom his taste and lady who received such pensioners
accepted a befitting salary for their board and education.] while
to the convent than the altar two other and somewhat elder virgins sat a
little apart, but close under the eye of the lady practising the courtly
game of"prime:" for the, diversion cards was in its zenith of fashion
under Edward IV., and' even half a century later was considered
one of the essential accomplishments of a well-educated young lady.[
So nor the love.

     The imagined wooer was less to be young and fair than renowned
     stately. She viewed him through the mists of the future, as the
     protector of her persecuted father, as the rebuilder of a fallen
     House, as the ennobler of a humbled name; to prevent the her
     converse, and feel the lovely infant worthy and from the moment
     in which her girl's heart beat at the voice of Hastings, the
     ideal there) The legislature was very anxious to keep these games
     sacred to the aristocracy, and very wroth with'prentices and the
     vulgar for imitating the ruinous amusements of their betters.] The
     exceeding stiffness, the solemn silence; of this female circle, but
     little accorded with the mood of the graceful visitant. The
     demoiselles stirred not at his entrance, and Katherine the
     tabouret close to the formidable chair of the presiding chieftainess.
     Katherine smiled faintly, I behold Cupido hovering in vain!" The
     baroness bent her stately brows, and the twenty rosy lips were all
     tightly pursed up, the wise man provoked.
     Coventry, will
this week have his business brought upon the stage again, about selling of
places, which I shall be sorry for, though the less, since I hear his
standing for Pen the other day, to the prejudice, though not to the wrong,
of my Lord Sandwich; and yet I do think what he did, he did out of a
principle of honesty.  Thence to Committee of Accounts, and delivered my
paper, and had little discourse, and was unwilling to stay long with them
to enter into much, but away and glad to be from them, though very civil
to me, but cunning and close I see they are.  So to Westminster Hall, and
there find the Parliament upon the Irish business, where going into the
Speaker's chamber I did hear how plainly one lawyer of counsel for the
complainants did inveigh by name against all the late Commissioners there.
Thence with Creed, thinking, but failed, of dining with Lord Crew, and so
he and I to Hercules Pillars, and there dined, and thence home by coach,
and so with Jack Fenn to the Chamberlain of London to look after the state
of some Navy assignments that are in his hands, and thence away, and
meeting Sir William Hooker, the Alderman, he did cry out mighty high
against Sir W. Pen for his getting such an estate, and giving L15,000 with
his daughter, which is more, by half, than ever he did give; but this the
world believes, and so let them.  Thence took coach and I all alone to
Hyde Park (passing through Duck Lane among the booksellers, only to get a
sight of the pretty little woman I did salute the other night, and did in
passing), and so all the evening in the Park, being a little unwilling to
be seen there, and at night home, and thereto W. Pen's and sat and talked
there with his wife and children a good while, he being busy in his
closet, I believe preparing his defence in Parliament, and so home to bed.

21st.  Up, and at the office all the morning, at noon dined at home, and
thence took Mrs. Turner out and carried her to the King's house, and saw
"The Indian Emperour;" and after that done, took Knepp out, and to
Kensington; and there walked in the garden, and then supped, and mighty
merry, there being also in the house Sir Philip Howard, and some company,
and had a dear reckoning, but merry, and away, it being quite night, home,
and dark, about 9 o'clock or more, and in my coming had the opportunity
the first time in my life to be bold with Knepp .  .  .  , and so left her
at home, and so Mrs. Turner and I home to my letters and to bed.  Here
hear how Sir W. Pen's impeachment was read, and agreed to, in the House
this day, and ordered to be engrossed; and he suspended the House--[From
sitting as a member pending the impeachment.-B.]--Harman set at liberty;
and Brouncker put out of the House, and a writ for a new election, and an
impeachment ordered to be brought in against him, he being fled!

     [Sir Charles Berkeley, jun. was chosen in his room.  In the sea-
     fight off Southwold Bay on June 3rd, 1665, the English triumphed
     over the Dutch, but the very considerable victory was not followed
     up.  During the night, while the Duke of York slept, Henry
     Brouncker, his groom of the bedchamber, ordered the lieutenant to
     shorten sail, by which means the progress of the whole fleet was
     retarded, the Duke of York's being the leading ship.  The duke
     affirmed that he first heard of Brouncker's unjustifiable action in
     July, and yet he kept the culprit in his service for nearly two
     years after the offence had come to his knowledge.  After Brouncker
     had been dismissed from the duke's service, the House of Commons
     ejected him.  The whole matter is one of the unsolved difficulties
     of history.  See Lister's "Life of Clarendon," ii., 334 335]

22nd.  Up, and all the morning at my office busy.  At noon, it being
washing day, I toward White Hall, and stopped and dined all alone at
Hercules Pillars, where I was mighty pleased to overhear a woman talk to
her counsel how she had troubled her neighbours with law, and did it very
roguishly and wittily.  Thence to White Hall, and there we attended the
Duke of York as usual; and I did present Mrs. Pett, the widow, and her
petition to the Duke of York, for some relief from the King.  Here was
to-day a proposition made to the Duke of York by Captain Von Hemskirke for
L20,000, to discover an art how to make a ship go two foot for one what
any ship do now, which the King inclines to try, it costing him nothing to
try; and it is referred to us to contract with the man. Thence to attend
the Council about the business of certificates to the Exchequer, where the
Commissioners of the Treasury of different minds, some would, and my Lord
Ashly would not have any more made out, and carried it there should not.
After done here, and the Council up, I by water from the Privy-stairs to
Westminster Hall; and, taking water, the King and the Duke of York were in
the new buildings; and the Duke of York called to me whither I was going?
and I answered aloud, "To wait on our maisters at Westminster;" at which
he and all the company laughed; but I was sorry and troubled for it
afterwards, for fear any Parliament-man should have been there; and will
be a caution to me for the time to come. Met with Roger Pepys, who tells
me they have been on the business of money, but not ended yet, but will
take up more time.  So to the fishmonger's, and bought a couple of
lobsters, and over to the 'sparagus garden, thinking to have met Mr.
Pierce, and his wife and Knepp; but met their servant coming to bring me
to Chatelin's, the French house, in Covent Garden, and there with musick
and good company, Manuel and his wife, and one Swaddle, a clerk of Lord
Arlington's, who dances, and speaks French well, but got drunk, and was
then troublesome, and here mighty merry till ten at night, and then I
away, and got a coach, and so home, where I find Balty and his wife come
to town, and did sup with them, and so they to bed.  This night the Duke
of Monmouth and a great many blades were at Chatelin's, and I left them
there, with a hackney-coach attending him.

23rd.  Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon comes
Knepp and Mrs. Pierce, and her daughter, and one Mrs. Foster, and dined
with me, and mighty merry, and after dinner carried them to the Tower, and
shewed them all to be seen there, and, among other things, the Crown and
Scepters and rich plate, which I myself never saw before, and indeed is
noble, and I mightily pleased with it.  Thence by water to the Temple, and
thereto the Cocke alehouse, and drank, and eat a lobster, and sang, and
mighty merry.  So, almost night, I carried Mrs. Pierce home, and then
Knepp and I to the Temple again, and took boat, it being darkish, and to
Fox Hall, it being now night, and a bonfire burning at Lambeth for the
King's coronation-day.  And there she and I drank; .  .  .  .  and so
back, and led her home, it being now ten at night; and so got a link; and,
walking towards home, just at my entrance into the ruines at St.
Dunstan's, I was met by two rogues with clubs, who come towards us. So I
went back, and walked home quite round by the wall, and got well home, and
to bed weary, but pleased at my day's pleasure, but yet displeased at my
expence, and time I lose.

24th.  Up betimes, and by water to White Hall, to the Duke of York, and
there hear that this day Hopis and Temple purpose to bring in the petition
against Sir W. Coventry, which I am sorry for, but hope he will get out of
it.  Here I presented Mrs. Pett and her condition to Mr. Wren for his
favour, which he promised us.  Thence to Lord Brouncker and sat and talked
with him, who thinks the Parliament will, by their violence and delay in
money matters, force the King to run any hazard, and dissolve them.
Thence to Ducke Lane, and there did overlook a great many of Monsieur
Fouquet's library, that a bookseller hath bought, and I did buy one
Spanish [work], "Los Illustres Varones."

     [Nicholas Fouquet, "Surintendant des Finances" in France, had built
     at Vaux a house which surpassed in magnificence any palace belonging
     to Louis XIV., prior to the erection of Versailles, and caused much
     envy to all the Court, especially to Colbert.  Fouquet died at
     Pignerol in 1680, after nineteen years' incarceration; and whilst
     Pepys was buying his books in London, Colbert had become prime
     minister in France, and Colbert's brother ambassador in England.
     The 'viper' had caught the 'squirrel'!--B.]

Here did I endeavour to see my pretty woman that I did baiser in las
tenebras a little while depuis.  And did find her sofa in the book[shop],
but had not la confidence para alter a elle.  So lost my pains.  But will
another time, and so home and to my office, and then to dinner.  Vermont
and New Hampshire refused to send delegates. Rhode Island consented, but
qualified her consent with the phrase "consistently with her obligations"--implying
that she would be no party to a separate peace or to the break-up of the
Union. Connecticut alone came in without reservation. Perhaps this partial
failure led the plotters to lend a more moderate colour to their policy.
At any rate, secession was not directly advocated at Hartford. It was
hinted that if such evils as those of which the people of New
England complained proved permanent, it might be necessary; but the
members of the Convention had the grace to admit that it ought not to be
attempted in the middle of a foreign war.
Their good faith, however, is dubious, for they put forward a proposal
so patently absurd that it could hardly have been made except for
the purpose of paving the way for a separate peace.

They declared that each State ought to be responsible for its own defences,
and they asked that their share of the Federal taxes should be paid over
to them for the purpose. With that and a resolution to meet again at Boston
and consider further steps if their demands were not met, they
adjourned. They never reassembled.

In the South the skies were clearing a little. Jackson of Tennessee,
vigorous and rapid in movement, a master of Indian warfare, leading an
army of soldiers who worshipped him as the Old Guard worshipped
Napoleon, by a series of quick and deadly strokes overthrew the Creeks,
followed them to their fastnesses, and broke them decisively at Tohopeka
in the famous "hickory patch" which was the holy place of their
nation.
He was rewarded in the way that he would have most desired: by a
commission against the English, who had landed at Pensacola in
Spanish territory, perhaps with the object of joining hands with
their Indian allies.But it is hoped that nothing will be done
more, this meeting of Parliament, which the King did, by a message
yesterday, declare again, should rise the 4th of May, and then only
adjourne for three months: and this message being only adjournment, did
please them mightily, for they are desirous of their power mightily.
Thence homeward by the Coffee House in Covent Garden, thinking to have met
Harris here but could not, and so home, and there, after my letters, I
home to have my hair cut by my sister Michell and her husband, and so to
bed.  This day I did first put off my waste-coate, the weather being very
hot, but yet lay in it at night, and shall, for a little time.

26th (Lord's day).  Lay long, and then up and to Church, and so home,
where there come and dined with me Harris, Rolt, and Bannister, and one
Bland, that sings well also, and very merry at dinner, and, after dinner,
to sing all the afternoon.  But when all was done, I did begin to think
that the pleasure of these people was not worth so often charge and cost
to me, as it hath occasioned me.  They being gone I and Balty walked as
far as Charing Cross, and there got a coach and to Hales's the painter,
thinking to have found Harris sitting there for his picture, which is
drawing for me.  But he, and all this day's company, and Hales, were got
to the Crown tavern, at next door, and thither I to them and stayed a
minute, leaving Captain Grant telling pretty stories of people that have
killed themselves, or been accessory to it, in revenge to other people,
and to mischief other people, and thence with Hales to his house, and
there did see his beginning of Harris's picture, which I think will be
pretty like, and he promises a very good picture.  Thence with Balty away
and got a coach and to Hide Park, and there up and down and did drink some
milk at the Lodge, and so home and to bed.

27th.  Up, and Captain Deane come to see me, and he and I toward
Westminster together, and I set him down at White Hall, while I to
Westminster Hall, and up to the Lords' House, and there saw Sir W. Pen go
into the House of Lords, where his impeachment was read to him, and he
used mighty civilly, the Duke of York being there; and two days hence, at
his desire, he is to bring in his answer, and a day then to be appointed
for his being heard with Counsel.  Thence down into the Hall, and with
Creed and Godolphin walked; and do hear that to-morrow is appointed, upon
a motion on Friday last, to discourse the business of my Lord Sandwich,

Thence I away to White Hall, and there took coach home with a stranger I
let into the coach, to club with me for it, he going into London, I set
him down at the lower end of Cheapside, and I home, and to Sir W. Pen's,

heard Mercer's voice, and my boy Tom's singing in the garden, which
pleased me mightily, I longing to see the girl, having not seen her since
my wife went; and so into the garden to her and sang, and then home to
supper, and mightily pleased with her company, in talking and singing, and
so parted, and to bed.

30th.  Up, and at the office all the morning.  At noon Sir J. Minnes and I
to the Dolphin Tavern, there to meet our neighbours, all of the Parish,
this being Procession-day, to dine.  But he thought that she, the
