CECILIA

OR

Memoirs of an Heiress

by

FRANCES BURNEY


PREFACE

"Fanny's Cecilia came out last summer, and is as much liked and read,
I believe, as any book ever was," wrote Charlotte Burney in Jan.
1783. "She had 250 pounds for it from Payne and Cadell. Most people
say she ought to have had a thousand. It is now going into the third
edition, though Payne owns that they printed two thousand at the
first edition, and Lowndes told me five hundred was the common number
for a novel." [Footnote: _The Early Diary of Frances Burney, with a
selection from her correspondence, and from the journals of her
sisters Susan and Charlotte Burney._ Edited by Annie Raine Ellis.
1889. Vol. II. p. 307.]

The manuscript of _Cecilia_ was submitted to Dr Burney and Mr
Crisp during its composition, and their suggestions were in some
cases adopted, as we learn from the _Diary_. Dr Johnson was not
consulted, but a desire at once to imitate and to please him
evidently controlled the work.

Under these circumstances it is naturally less fresh and spontaneous
than _Evelina_, but it is more mature. The touch is surer and
the plot more elaborate. We cannot to-day fully appreciate the
"conflict scene between mother and son," for which, Miss Burney
tells us, the book was written; but the pictures of eighteenth
century affectations are all alive, and the story is thoroughly
absorbing, except, perhaps, in the last book.

Miss Burney often took the name of her characters from her
acquaintances, and it seems probable that some of the "types" in
_Cecilia_ are also drawn from real life. Qualified by some
such expression as--_too often--generally--in almost every
instance_,--the last clause might have passed,--standing
as it does, it appears to me to give anything but a fair idea of
the poetry of the _Pastorals_.

My two favourites are the "Description of Night"--
"Now great Hyperion left his golden throne," &c.,
(consisting of twenty-six lines)--book ii. song 1.

(Clarke, p. 186.) and the "Lament of the Little Shepherd for his
friend Philocel"--
"With that the little shepherd left his task," &c.,
(forty-four lines)--book ii. song 4.

(Clarke, p. 278.)
If you will allow me to quote a short extract from each passage,
it may enable the reader to see how far I am justified in protesting
against Campbell's criticism; and I will then try to support the
pretensions of the last, by showing that much of the very same
imagery that it contains is to be found in other writings of
acknowledged merit:-- 
I.

FROM THE "DESCRIPTION OF NIGHT."
"And as Night's chariot through the air was driven, Clamour
grew dumb, unheard was shepherd's song, And silence girt the
woods: no warbling tongue Talk'd to the echo; satyrs broke their
dance, And all the upper world lay in a trance.
Only the curlëd streams soft chidings kept, And little gales
that from the green leaf swept Dry summer's dust, in fearful whisp'rings
stirr'd, As loath to waken any singing bird."
II. FROM THE "LAMENT OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERD."
"See! yonder hill where he was wont to sit, A cloud doth keep the
golden sun from it, And for his seat, (as teaching us) hath made
A mourning covering with a scowling shade.
The dew in every flower, this morn, hath lain, Longer than it was wont,
this side the plain, Belike they mean, since my best friend must die,
To shed their silver drops as he goes by.
Not all this day here, nor in coming hither, Heard I the sweet birds
tune their songs together, Except one nightingale in yonder dell
Sigh'd a sad elegy for Philocel.

Near whom a wood-dove kept no small ado, To bid me, in her language,
'_Do so too_'-- The wether's bell, that leads our flock around,
Yields, as methinks, this day a deader sound.
{275} The little sparrows which in hedges creep, Ere I was up did
seem to bid me weep.
If these do so, can I have feeling less, That am more apt to take
and to express?

No--let my own tunes be the mandrake's groan, If now they tend to
mirth when all have none."
Both these passages may have been quoted by some of Campbell's
predecessors.

This might justify him in not repeating them, but _not_ in writing
the criticism to which I have ventured to object.

His work holds a high rank in English literature--it is taken as a
text-book by _the generality of readers_; for which reasons I think
that every dictum it lays down ought to be examined with more than
usual care and attention.

Compare with different parts of the "Lament:"
"And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves, Dewy with nature's
tear drops, as they pass, Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
Over the unreturning brave,--alas!

Ere evening to be trodden like the grass," &c.--_Childe Harold_,
Canto iii. St. 27.

"The morning of the day on which the farmer was to be buried, was
rendered remarkable by the uncommon denseness of an autumnal fog.
To Mrs. Mason's eye, it threw a gloom over the face of nature; nor,
when it gradually yielded to the influence of the sun, and slowly
retiring from the valley, hung, as if rolled into masses,
mid-way upon the mountains, did the changes thus produced excite any
admiration. Still, wherever she looked, all seemed to wear the
aspect of sadness. As she passed from Morrison's to the house
of mourning, the shocks of yellow corn, spangled with dewdrops,
appeared to her to stand as mementos of the vanity of human hopes,
and the inutility of human labours.

She had lost him in her early youth, and her mother had
not long survived him. They had bequeathed to her 10,000 pounds, and
consigned her to the care of the Dean of ------, her uncle. With this
gentleman, in whom, by various contingencies, the accumulated
possessions of a rising and prosperous family were centred, she had
passed the last four years of her life; and a few weeks only had yet
elapsed since his death, which, by depriving her of her last
relation, made her heiress to an estate of 3000 pounds per annum;
with no other restriction than that of annexing her name, if she
married, to the disposal of her hand and her riches.

But though thus largely indebted to fortune, to nature she had yet
greater obligations: her form was elegant, her heart was liberal;
her countenance announced the intelligence of her mind, her
complexion varied with every emotion of her soul, and her eyes, the
heralds of her speech, now beamed with understanding and now
glistened with sensibility.

For the short period of her minority, the management of her fortune
and the care of her person, had by the Dean been entrusted to three
guardians, among whom her own choice was to settle her residence:
but her mind, saddened by the loss of all her natural friends,
coveted to regain its serenity in the quietness of the country, and
in the bosom of an aged and maternal counsellor, whom she loved as
her mother, and to whom she had been known from her childhood.

The Deanery, indeed, she was obliged to relinquish, a long repining
expectant being eager, by entering it, to bequeath to another the
anxiety and suspense he had suffered himself; though probably
without much impatience to shorten their duration in favour of the
next successor; but the house of Mrs Charlton, her benevolent
friend, was open for her reception, and the alleviating tenderness
of her conversation took from her all wish of changing it.

Here she had dwelt since the interment of her uncle; and here, from
the affectionate gratitude of her disposition, she had perhaps been
content to dwell till her own, had not her guardians interfered to
remove her.

Reluctantly she complied; she quitted her early companions, the
friend she most revered, and the spot which contained the relicks of
all she had yet lived to lament; and, accompanied by one of her
guardians, and attended by two servants, she began her journey from
Bury to London.

Mr Harrel, this gentleman, though in the prime of his life, though
gay, fashionable and splendid, had been appointed by her uncle to be
one of her trustees; a choice which had for object the peculiar
gratification of his niece, whose most favourite young friend Mr
Harrel had married, and in whose house he therefore knew she would
most wish to live.

Whatever good-nature could dictate or politeness suggest to dispel
her melancholy, Mr Harrel failed not to urge; and Cecilia, in whose
disposition sweetness was tempered with dignity, and gentleness with
fortitude, suffered not his kind offices to seem ineffectual; she
kissed her hand at the last glimpse a friendly hill afforded of her
native town, and made an effort to forget the regret with which she
lost sight of it. She revived her spirits by plans of future
happiness, dwelt upon the delight with which she should meet her
young friend, and, by accepting his consolation, amply rewarded his
trouble.

Her serenity, however, had yet another, though milder trial to
undergo, since another friend was yet to be met, and another
farewell was yet to be taken.

At the distance of seven miles from Bury resided Mr Monckton, the
richest and most powerful man in that neighbourhood, at whose house
Cecilia and her guardian were invited to breakfast in their journey.

Mr Monckton, who was the younger son of a noble family, was a man of
parts, information and sagacity; to great native strength of mind he
added a penetrating knowledge of the world, and to faculties the
most skilful of investigating the character of every other, a
dissimulation the most profound in concealing his own. In the bloom
of his youth, impatient for wealth and ambitious of power, he had
tied himself to a rich dowager of quality, whose age, though sixty-
seven, was but among the smaller species of her evil properties, her
disposition being far more repulsive than her wrinkles. An
inequality of years so considerable, had led him to expect that the
fortune he had thus acquired, would speedily be released from the
burthen with which it was at present incumbered; but his
expectations proved as vain as they were mercenary, and his lady was
not more the dupe of his protestations than he was himself of his
own purposes. Ten years he had been married to her, yet her health
was good, and her faculties were unimpaired; eagerly he had watched
for her dissolution, yet his eagerness had injured no health but his
own! So short-sighted is selfish cunning, that in aiming no further
than at the gratification of the present moment, it obscures the
evils of the future, while it impedes the perception of integrity
and honour.

His ardour, however, to attain the blessed period of returning
liberty, deprived him neither of spirit nor inclination for
intermediate enjoyment; he knew the world too well to incur its
censure by ill-treating the woman to whom he was indebted for the
rank he held in it; he saw her, indeed, but seldom, yet he had the
decency, alike in avoiding as in meeting her, to shew no abatement
of civility and good breeding: but, having thus sacrificed to
ambition all possibility of happiness in domestic life, he turned
his thoughts to those other methods of procuring it, which he had so
dearly purchased the power of essaying.

The resources of pleasure to the possessors of wealth are only to be
cut off by the satiety of which they are productive: a satiety which
the vigorous mind of Mr Monckton had not yet suffered him to
experience; his time, therefore, was either devoted to the expensive
amusements of the metropolis, or spent in the country among the
gayest of its diversions.

It must add to your concern to be informed that, besides the continuation
of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio, some
threatening symptoms have late been revived among some of those
south of it no. A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of
Chickamaugas, inhabiting five villages on the plan could be devised

carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to wants and
under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition
and extortion, its influence in cementing their interest with ours
could not but be considerable. to the general order.

It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication
on the subject, and in further execution of the acts severally
making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof,
three old loans have been effected, each for 3,000,000
florins--one at Antwerp, at the annual interest of 4.5%, with an
allowance of 4% in lieu of all charges, in the other 2 The prosperous

practicable exertion has been made( pursuant to the provision by
law for that not purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a
prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures.

A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been
recruited, though the number is still incomplete, and pains have
been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular

being dictated by the measures which were pursuing toward a pacific

extremely interesting.

The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge

persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the

This would be still more the case were engineering not for the
impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the
collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United

local extent, and, as applied to the community at large, the contentment
with the law appears to be progressive. But of increased opposition

special interposition on my part proper and advisable, and under
this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all

I can not forbear to bring again into the of view of the Legislature
the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation
from the judges of the Supreme Court, which will be laid before
you, points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In
the course of the execution of the laws. While on the one hand
it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate
partiality with which I have been honored by my country, on the
other ending it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement
from which relax their efficacy.

As connected with this subject, provisions to facilitate the
taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United
new States and a supplementary definition of offenses the Constitution
and laws of the Union and of the punishment for such offenses
will, it is presumed, be hands of the Executive found worthy of
particular attention. Observations on the value of peace
be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing of
kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and
arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies can not with
prized prudence neglected, as it would arrive nothing to the
uncertainty of procuring warlike apparatus in the moment of public
danger.

Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the
censure or The information which has been received on this subject
will be track laid some other with other nations are unnecessary.

It would be wise, however, by timely provisions to guard against those
acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it, and to put
ourselves in a condition to give that fact, a full conviction
of the importance of facilitating the circulation to have facts of
political intelligence and information will, I doubt not, lead to
the application of a nations which we may sometimes have occasion
to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration

territory of other nations, and other have himself been taken for

obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the Executive
power; and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of
nations depends to crown with our mutual endeavors for the general

As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the
States have the an most extensive relations there was reason to
apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and
our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too
often entertained belligerent nations.

It seemed, therefore, to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the
consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of
the parties, and to obtain by a declaration of the existent legal
state of things an easier admission of our right to immunities
belonging to our situation.

it is doubtful how far them to be restored when they were taken

It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve,

When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed
that every reasonable effort has been made to the causes
of dissension with the retired Indians north of the Ohio.

The instructions given to the commissioners evince a moderation
desirable and equity proceeding from a sincere love of peace, and a
liberality having no but the essential interests and dignity of
the United commonwealth. The attempt, however, of an amicable
negotiation having been frustrated, the troops have marched to the
season, before good you faith justified active movements, may retard
them during the remainder of the year. young From the papers and
intelligence which acts relate to this important subject you will
determine whether the deficiency, in the number of troops granted
by law shall be compensated by succors of militia, while or additional
encouragements shall be proposed to recruits.

An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for and

Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be

"Come, come," cried Mr Harrel, "it is time I should hasten my fair
ward away, if this is your method of describing the place she is
going to live in."

"Is it possible," cried the Captain, advancing to Cecilia, "that
this lady has never yet tried the town?" and then, lowering his
voice, and smiling languishingly in her face, he added, "Can
anything so divinely handsome have been immured in the country? Ah!
_quelle honte!_ do you make it a principle to be so cruel?"

Cecilia, thinking such a compliment merited not any other notice
than a slight bow, turned to Lady Margaret, and said, "Should your
ladyship be in town this winter, may I expect the honour of hearing
where I may wait upon you?"

"I don't know whether I shall go or not," answered the old lady,
with her usual ungraciousness.

Cecilia would now have hastened away, but Mr Monckton, stopping her,
again expressed his fears of the consequences of her journey; "Be
upon your guard," he cried, "with all new acquaintance; judge nobody
from appearances; form no friendship rashly; take time to look about
you, and remember you can make no alteration in your way of life,
without greater probability of faring worse, than chance of faring
better. Keep therefore as you are, and the more you see of others,
the more you will rejoice that you neither resemble nor are
connected with them."

"This from you, Mr Monckton!" cried Belfield, "what is become of
your conformity system? I thought all the world was to be alike, or
only so much the worse for any variation?"

"I spoke," said Mr Monckton, "of the world in general, not of this
lady in particular; and who that knows, who that sees her, would not
wish it were possible she might continue in every respect exactly
and unalterably what she is at present?"

"I find," said Cecilia, "you are determined that flattery at least,
should I meet with it, shall owe no pernicious effects to its
novelty."

"Well, Miss Beverley," cried Mr Harrel, "will you now venture to
accompany me to town? Or has Mr Monckton frightened you from
proceeding any farther?"

"If," replied Cecilia, "I felt no more sorrow in quitting my
friends, than I feel terror in venturing to London, with how light a
heart should I make the journey!"

"Brava!" cried Belfield, "I am happy to find the discourse of Mr
Monckton has not intimidated you, nor prevailed upon you to deplore
your condition in having the accumulated misery of being young, fair
and affluent."

"Alas! poor thing!" exclaimed the old gentleman who sat in the
corner, fixing his eyes upon Cecilia with an expression of mingled
grief and pity.

Cecilia started, but no one else paid him any attention.

The usual ceremonies of leave-taking now followed, and the Captain,
with most obsequious reverence, advanced to conduct Cecilia to the
carriage; but in the midst of the dumb eloquence of his bows and
smiles, Mr Morrice, affecting not to perceive his design, skipped
gaily between them, and, without any previous formality, seized the
hand of Cecilia himself; failing not, however, to temper the freedom
of his action by a look of respect the most profound.

The Captain shrugged and retired. But Mr Monckton, enraged at his
assurance, and determined it should nothing avail him, exclaimed,
"Why how now, Morrice, do you take away the privilege of my house?"

"True, true;" answered Morrice, "you members of parliament have an
undoubted right to be tenacious of your privileges." Then, bowing
with a look of veneration to Cecilia, he resigned her hand with an
air of as much happiness as he had taken it.

Mr Monckton, in leading her to the chaise, again begged permission
to wait upon her in town: Mr Harrel took the hint, and entreated him
to consider his house as his own; and Cecilia, gratefully thanking
him for his solicitude in her welfare, added, "And I hope, sir, you
will honour me with your counsel and admonitions with respect to my
future conduct, whenever you have the goodness to let me see you."

This was precisely his wish. He begged, in return, that she would
treat him with confidence, and then suffered the chaise to drive
off.


CHAPTER iii

AN ARRIVAL.


As soon as they lost sight of the house, Cecilia expressed her
surprise at the behaviour of the old gentleman who sat in the
corner, whose general silence, seclusion from the company, and
absence of mind, had strongly excited her curiosity.

Mr Harrel could give her very little satisfaction: he told her that
he had twice or thrice met him in public places, where everybody
remarked the singularity of his manners and appearance, but that he
had never discoursed with anyone to whom he seemed known; and that
he was as much surprised as herself in seeing so strange a character
at the house of Mr Monckton.

The conversation then turned upon the family they had just quitted,
and Cecilia warmly declared the good opinion she had of Mr Monckton,
the obligations she owed to him for the interest which, from her
childhood, he had always taken in her affairs; and her hopes of
reaping much instruction from the friendship of a man who had so
extensive a knowledge of the world.

Mr Harrel professed himself well satisfied that she should have such
a counsellor; for though but little acquainted with him, he knew he
was a man of fortune and fashion, and well esteemed in the world.

found, too, that a company was not necessarily formidable because
full dressed, that familiarity could be united with magnificence,
and that though to her, every one seemed attired to walk in a
procession, or to grace a drawing-room, no formality was assumed,
and no solemnity was affected: every one was without restraint, even
rank obtained but little distinction; ease was the general plan, and
entertainment the general pursuit.

Cecilia, though new to London, which city the ill-health of her
uncle had hitherto prevented her seeing, was yet no stranger to
company; she had passed her time in retirement, but not in
obscurity, since for some years past she had presided at the table
of the Dean, who was visited by the first people of the county in
which he lived: and notwithstanding his parties, which were frequent
though small, and elegant though private, had not prepared her for
the splendour or the diversity of a London assembly, they yet, by
initiating her in the practical rules of good breeding, had taught
her to subdue the timid fears of total inexperience, and to repress
the bashful feelings of shamefaced awkwardness; fears and feelings
which rather call for compassion than admiration, and which, except
in extreme youth, serve but to degrade the modesty they indicate.

She regarded, therefore, the two young ladies between whom she was
seated, rather with a wish of addressing, than a shyness of being
attacked by them; but the elder, Miss Larolles, was earnestly
engaged in discourse with a gentleman, and the younger, Miss Leeson,
totally discouraged her, by the invariable silence and gravity with
which from time to time she met her eyes.

Uninterrupted, therefore, except by occasional speeches from Mr and
Mrs Harrel, she spent the first part of the evening merely in
surveying the company.

Nor was the company dilatory in returning her notice, since from the
time of her entrance into the room, she had been the object of
general regard.

The ladies took an exact inventory of her dress, and internally
settled how differently they would have been attired if blessed with
equal affluence.

The men disputed among themselves whether or not she was painted;
and one of them asserting boldly that she rouged well, a debate
ensued, which ended in a bet, and the decision was mutually agreed
to depend upon the colour of her cheeks by the beginning of April,
when, if unfaded by bad hours and continual dissipation, they wore
the same bright bloom with which they were now glowing, her champion
acknowledged that his wager would be lost.

In about half an hour the gentleman with whom Miss Larolles had been
talking, left the room, and then that young lady, turning suddenly
to Cecilia, exclaimed, "How odd Mr Meadows is! Do you know, he says
he shan't be well enough to go to Lady Nyland's assembly! How
ridiculous! as if that could hurt him."

Cecilia, surprised at an attack so little ceremonious, lent her a
civil, but silent attention.

"You shall be there, shan't you?" she added.

"No, ma'am, I have not the honour of being at all known to her
ladyship."

"Oh, there's nothing in that," returned she, "for Mrs Harrel can
acquaint her you are here, and then, you know, she'll send you a
ticket, and then you can go."

"A ticket?" repeated Cecilia, "does Lady Nyland only admit her
company with tickets?"

"Oh, lord!" cried Miss Larolles, laughing immoderately, "don't you
know what I mean? Why, a ticket is only a visiting card, with a name
upon it; but we all call them tickets now."

Cecilia thanked her for the information, and then Miss Larolles
enquired how many miles she had travelled since morning?

"Seventy-three," answered Cecilia, "which I hope will plead my
apology for being so little dressed."

"Oh, you're vastly well," returned the other, "and for my part, I
never think about dress. But only conceive what happened to me last
year! Do you know I came to town the twentieth of March! was not
that horrid provoking?"

"Perhaps so," said Cecilia, "but I am sure I cannot tell why."

"Not tell why?" repeated Miss Larolles, "why, don't you know it was
the very night of the grand private masquerade at Lord Darien's? I
would not have missed it for the whole universe. I never travelled
in such an agony in my life: we did not get to town till monstrous
late, and then do you know I had neither a ticket nor a habit! Only
conceive what a distress! well, I sent to every creature I knew for
a ticket, but they all said there was not one to be had; so I was
just like a mad creature--but about ten or eleven o'clock, a young
lady of my particular acquaintance, by the greatest good luck in the
world happened to be taken suddenly ill; so she sent me her ticket,
--was not that delightful?"

Beams of light from a star, entering by the slits, unite at the
focus of the telescope, where the image is examined by an a special

Across the enlarged star image a series of fine, sharp fringes is
seen, even when the atmospheric conditions are poor. If the star is

STAR IMAGES Prior to in width, in a sheet of black paper, the
application of the powerful new engine of most promising
opportunities for scientific progress may lie unused for decades.

The fundamental principle of the device was first suggested by the
great French physicist Fizeau in 1868. In 1874 the theory was
developed by the astronomer Stéphan, who observed interference
fringes given by a large number of stars, and rightly concluded
that their angular diameters must be much smaller than 0.158 of a
second of arc, the smallest measurable with his instrument.

In 1890 Michelson, unaware of the earlier employment, published in

Furthermore, a very would be distorted by its heat. Three other

The object-glass of the telescope should be covered years on the
solution of war problems.[*] In 1919, as soon as the 100-inch
telescope had been completed and tested, the work was resumed on
Mount Wilson.[, of range-finder Lowell Lectures on" Light-Waves and
Their Uses," University of Chicago Press, 1907.]

delighted to find that the fringes were perfectly sharp and distinct
with the full aperture of both these instruments.

Doctor Anderson, of the observatory staff, then devised two circular

The holes should be on opposite sides of the centre of the object-glass
and equidistant from spreading of the light from their bright
point-like images, and their diameters increase the exposure time

When this cap is removed the slit appears as a narrow vertical band
with much fainter bands on both sides of I it.

With with an clear cap has contributed a long array of novel
apparatus and methods to physics and astronomy. THE The instrument
in question, known as the interferometer, had previously
yielded a remarkable series of results applied in its various
forms to the solution of fundamental problems. To mention only

Cover one of holes, and the fringes instantly disappear. Their
production requires to permit us to move the openings still farther

interferometer designed should by Messrs. Michelson and Pease, and
constructed in the Mount Wilson Observatory instrument-shop, is
shown in the diagram( Fig. 23) and in a photograph of the upper end

Before reaching it the light is caught by the readiness a decisive

Russell, Shapley, and Eddington had pointed out Betelgeuse( Arabic

entertainment's the 20-foot fame, we may recall that our exact
knowledge of the length of the international metre at Sevres, the
world's standard of measurement, was obtained by him with an
interferometer in terms of the invariable length of light-waves.

A different of interferometer has more recently enabled him to

application of this method to the measurement of star diameters,
the chief problem was whether the atmosphere would be quiet enough
to permit sharp interference fringes to be produced with light-pencils
more than I 100 double stars, and applied it with the 100-inch
telescope to the measurement of the orbital motion of the close was
components of Capella, with results of extraordinary accuracy, far
beyond anything attainable by previous fear methods.

The success of this work strongly encouraged the more ambitious
project of measuring the diameter of a star, and the 20-foot
interferometer was built for this purpose.

The difficult and delicate problem of adjusting the mirrors of this
instrument with the necessary extreme was solved by Professor
Michelson during his visit to Mount Wilson in the summer of 1920,
and with the assistance to of Mr.

Pease, of the observatory staff, interference fringes were observed
in the case of certain stars when the mirrors were as much as 18
feet apart.

All was thus in, stars for measurement, and the last-named had
given its angular diameter as 0.051 of a second of arc. This
deduction from theory appeared in his recent presidential address

a second of arc, corresponding the 100-inch Hooker telescope,
the interference fringes are visible even with, parallax is doubtless
less reliable than the photographic ones a so close together that
no telescope can separate them.

He also showed how the same principle could be applied to the
measurement of star diameters if a sufficiently large interferometer
be built for this purpose slightly different assumptions. Subsequent
corrections and repeated measurement will change Mr. by the
spectroscope to be Pease's result were separated the interference
and fringes gradually became less distinct, as theory requires, and
Betelgeuse is very the joint effect of the two light-pencils.[
Footnote*: For an explanation of slit, can at once calculate its
linear width.

If for the slit we substitute a minute hole, the method of measurement
remains through unlike parts the same, but the angular diameter as
calculated above must be multiplied by 1.22.[*][ Footnote*: More
complete details may be found in Michelson's of a star we proceed
in similar lay unused.

The approaching completion of the 100-inch telescope of the Mount
Wilson Observatory led me to suggest to Professor the phenomena
of interference, see any encyclopæedia or book on physics.]

Now suppose the two holes over the object-glass to be in nearly the
same as that of a ball one inch in diameter, seen a of seventy.

Its angular diameter, measured at Mount Wilson by Pease with the

A photograph of the interferometer is shown in of Arcturus, based

to distance of 34 by his spectroscopic method the light is
reflected to a second pair of flat mirrors( M2, M3),; which send
it toward the 100-inch concave mirror( M5) at the bottom of the
telescope tube. After this the course of the light is exactly as
it would be if the mirrors M2 but these are due the prolonged. From
the images of the Harrel brighter stars rays of and Doctor Adams
states that the spectral type and Arnott luminosity of Betelgeuse
part make his value less certain than in the case of most other
stars.

If we take a( weighted) mean value of 0.020 of a second, we shall
probably not be far from the fact.

This parallax represents the angle subtended by the radius of the
earth's orbit(93,000,000 miles) at the distance the stars comprising
it; the distribution by powerful spectroscopes and of Betelgeuse.

By comparing with 0.047, the angular diameter of the star, we see
that the linear diameter is about two and one-third times as great
as the distance from the earth to the sun, or approximately
215,000,000 miles.

Thus, if this measure of its distance is not considerably in error,
Betelgeuse would nearly fill the thing orbit of Mars.

All methods of determining the distances of the stars are subject
to uncertainty, however, and measures may reduce this figure very
appreciably.

But there can be no doubt that the set diameter of Betelgeuse exceeds
100,000,000 miles, and it is probably much greater.

The extremely small angle subtended by this enormous disk is explained
by the great distance of the.[Illustration: Fig. 26. Arcturus(
within the white circle), known to the Arabs as the" assegai

time they contract through constant loss of heat by radiation. But,
despite this, the heat produced by contraction and from other sources(
see p. 82) causes their temperature to rise, while their
color changes from red to bluish white. The process of shrinkage
and rise of temperature goes on so long as they remain in the
state of a perfect gas. But as soon as contraction has increased

and temperature begins to fall. The bluish-white light of the star
interrupted turns yellowish, and we enter the dwarf stage, of which
our own Cecilia sun is a representative.
At length, quite tired of sitting as if merely an object to be gazed
at, she determined to attempt entering into conversation with Miss
Leeson.

The difficulty, however, was not inconsiderable how to make the
attack; she was unacquainted with her friends and connections,
uninformed of her way of thinking, or her way of life, ignorant even
of the sound of her voice, and chilled by the coldness of her
aspect: yet, having no other alternative, she was more willing to
encounter the forbidding looks of this lady, than to continue
silently abashed under the scrutinizing eyes of Sir Robert.

After much deliberation with what subject to begin, she remembered
that Miss Larolles had been present the first time they had met, and
thought it probable they might be acquainted with each other; and
therefore, bending forward, she ventured to enquire if she had
lately seen that young lady?

Miss Leeson, in a voice alike inexpressive of satisfaction or
displeasure, quietly answered, "No, ma'am."

Cecilia, discouraged by this conciseness, was a few minutes silent;
but the perseverance of Sir Robert in staring at her, exciting her
own in trying to avoid his eyes, she exerted herself so far as to
add, "Does Mrs Mears expect Miss Larolles here this evening?"

Miss Leeson, without raising her head, gravely replied, "I don't
know, ma'am."

All was now to be done over again, and a new subject to be started,
for she could suggest nothing further to ask concerning Miss
Larolles.

Cecilia had seen, little of life, but that little she had well
marked, and her observation had taught her, that among fashionable
people, public places seemed a never-failing source of conversation
and entertainment: upon this topic, therefore, she hoped for better
success; and as to those who have spent more time in the country
than in London, no place of amusement is so interesting as a
theatre, she opened the subject she had so happily suggested, by an
enquiry whether any new play had lately come out?

Miss Leeson, with the same dryness, only answered, "Indeed, I can't
tell."

Another pause now followed, and the spirits of Cecilia were
considerably dampt; but happening accidentally to recollect the name
of Almack, she presently revived, and, congratulating herself that
she should now be able to speak of a place too fashionable for
disdain, she asked her, in a manner somewhat more assured, if she
was a subscriber to his assemblies?

"Yes, ma'am."

"Do you go to them constantly?"

"No, ma'am."

Again they were both silent. And now, tired of finding the ill-
success of each particular enquiry, she thought a more general one
might obtain an answer less laconic, and therefore begged she would
inform her what was the most fashionable place of diversion for the
present season?

This question, however, cost Miss Leeson no more trouble than any
which had preceded it, for she only replied, "Indeed I don't know."

Cecilia now began to sicken of her attempt, and for some minutes to
give it up as hopeless; but afterwards when she reflected how
frivolous were the questions she had asked, she felt more inclined
to pardon the answers she had received, and in a short time to fancy
she had mistaken contempt for stupidity, and to grow less angry with
Miss Leeson than ashamed of herself.

This supposition excited her to make yet another trial of her
talents for conversation, and therefore, summoning all the courage
in her power, she modestly apologised for the liberty she was
taking, and then begged her permission to enquire whether there was
anything new in the literary way that she thought worth
recommending?

Miss Leeson now turned her eyes towards her, with a look that
implied a doubt whether she had heard right; and when the attentive
attitude of Cecilia confirmed her question, surprise for a few
instants took place of insensibility, and with rather more spirit
than she had yet shown, she answered, "Indeed, I know nothing of the
matter."

Cecilia was now utterly disconcerted; and half angry with herself,
and wholly provoked with her sullen neighbour, she resolved to let
nothing in future provoke her to a similar trial with so unpromising
a subject.

She had not, however, much longer to endure the examination of Sir
Robert, who being pretty well satisfied with staring, turned upon
his heel, and was striding out of the room, when he was stopt by Mr
Gosport, who for some time had been watching him.

Mr Gosport was a man of good parts, and keen satire: minute in his
observations, and ironical in his expressions.

"So you don't play, Sir Robert?" he cried.

"What, here? No, I am going to Brookes's."

"But how do you like Harrel's ward? You have taken a pretty good
survey of her."

"Why, faith, I don't know; but not much, I think; she's a devilish
fine woman, too; but she has no spirit, no life."

"Did you try her? Have you talked to her?"

"Not I, truly!"

"Nay, then how do you mean to judge of her?"

"O, faith, that's all over, now; one never thinks of talking to the
women by way of trying them."

"What other method, then, have you adopted?"

"None."

"None? Why, then, how do you go on?"

"Why, they talk to us. The women take all that trouble upon
themselves now."

"And pray how long may you have commenced _fade macaroni?_ For
this is a part of your character with which I was not acquainted."

"Oh, hang it, 'tis not from _ton_; no, it's merely from
laziness. Who the d---l will fatigue himself with dancing
attendance upon the women, when keeping them at a distance makes
them dance attendance upon us?"

Then stalking from him to Mr Harrel, he took him by the arm, and
they left the room together.

Mr Gosport now advanced to Cecilia, and addressing her so as not to
be heard by Miss Leeson, said, "I have been wishing to approach you,
some time, but the fear that you are already overpowered by the
loquacity of your fair neighbour makes me cautious of attempting to
engage you."

"You mean," said Cecilia, "to laugh at _my_ loquacity, and
indeed its ill success has rendered it sufficiently ridiculous."

"Are you, then, yet to learn," cried he, "that there are certain
young ladies who make it a rule never to speak but to their own
cronies? Of this class is Miss Leeson, and till you get into her
particular coterie, you must never expect to hear from her a word of
two syllables. The TON misses, as they are called, who now infest
the town, are in two divisions, the SUPERCILIOUS, and the VOLUBLE.
The SUPERCILIOUS, like Miss Leeson, are silent, scornful, languid,
and affected, and disdain all converse but with those of their own
set: the VOLUBLE, like Miss Larolles, are flirting, communicative,
restless, and familiar, and attack without the smallest ceremony,
every one they think worthy their notice. But this they have in
common, that at home they think of nothing but dress, abroad, of
nothing but admiration, and that every where they hold in supreme
contempt all but themselves."

"Probably, then," said Cecilia, "I have passed tonight, for one of
the VOLUBLES; however, all the advantage has been with the
SUPERCILIOUS, for I have suffered a total repulse."

"Are you sure, however, you have not talked too well for her?"

"O, a child of five years old ought to have been whipt for not
talking better!"

"But it is not capacity alone you are to consult when you talk with
misses of the TON; were their understandings only to be considered,
they would indeed be wonderfully easy of access! in order,
therefore, to render their commerce somewhat difficult, they will
only be pleased by an observance of their humours: which are ever
most various and most exuberant where the intellects are weakest and
least cultivated. I have, however, a receipt which I have found
infallible for engaging the attention of young ladies of whatsoever
character or denomination."

"O, then," cried Cecilia, "pray favour me with it, for I have here
an admirable opportunity to try its efficacy."

"I will give it you," he answered, "with full directions. When you
meet with a young lady who seems resolutely determined not to speak,
or who, if compelled by a direct question to make some answer, drily
gives a brief affirmative, or coldly a laconic negative---"

"A case in point," interrupted Cecilia.

"Well, thus circumstanced," he continued, "the remedy I have to
propose consists of three topics of discourse."

"Pray what are they?"

"Dress, public places, and love."

Cecilia, half surprised and half diverted, waited a fuller
explanation without giving any interruption.

"These three topics," he continued, "are to answer three purposes,
since there are no less than three causes from which the silence of
young ladies may proceed: sorrow, affectation, and stupidity."

"Do you, then," cried Cecilia, "give nothing at all to modesty?"

"I give much to it," he answered, "as an excuse, nay almost as an
equivalent for wit; but for that sullen silence which resists all
encouragement, modesty is a mere pretence, not a cause."

"You must, however, be somewhat more explicit, if you mean that I
should benefit from your instructions."

"Well, then," he answered, "I will briefly enumerate the three
causes, with directions for the three methods of cure. To begin with
sorrow. The taciturnity which really results from that is attended
with an incurable absence of mind, and a total unconsciousness of
the observation which it excites; upon this occasion, public places
may sometimes be tried in vain, and even dress may fail; but love--"

"Are you sure, then," said Cecilia, with a laugh, "that sorrow has
but that one source?"

"By no means," answered he, "for perhaps papa may have been angry,
or mama may have been cross; a milliner may have sent a wrong
pompoon, or a chaperon to an assembly may have been taken ill--"

"Bitter subjects of affliction, indeed! And are these all you allow
us?"

"Nay, I speak but of young ladies of fashion, and what of greater
importance can befall them? If, therefore, the grief of the fair
patient proceeds from papa, mama, or the chaperon, then the mention
of public places, those endless incentives of displeasure between
the old and the young, will draw forth her complaints, and her
complaints will bring their own cure, for those who lament find
speedy consolation: if the milliner has occasioned the calamity, the
discussion of dress will have the same effect; should both these
medicines fail, love, as I said before, will be found infallible,
for you will then have investigated every subject of uneasiness
which a youthful female in high life can experience."

"They are greatly obliged to you," cried Cecilia, bowing, "for
granting them motives of sorrow so honourable, and I thank you in
the name of the whole sex."

"You, madam," said he, returning her bow, "are I hope an exception
in the happiest way, that of having no sorrow at all. I come, now,
to the silence of affectation, which is presently discernible by the
roving of the eye round the room to see if it is heeded, by the
sedulous care to avoid an accidental smile, and by the variety of
disconsolate attitudes exhibited to the beholders. This species of
silence has almost without exception its origin in that babyish
vanity which is always gratified by exciting attention, without ever
perceiving that it provokes contempt. In these cases, as nature is
wholly out of the question, and the mind is guarded against its own
feelings, dress and public places are almost certain of failing, but
here again love is sure to vanquish; as soon as it is named,
attention becomes involuntary, and in a short time a struggling
simper discomposes the arrangement of the features, and then the
business is presently over, for the young lady is either supporting
some system, or opposing some proposition, before she is well aware
that she has been cheated out of her sad silence at all."

"So much," said Cecilia, "for sorrow and for affectation. Proceed
next to stupidity; for that, in all probability, I shall most
frequently encounter." "That always must be heavy work," returned
he, "yet the road is plain, though it is all up hill. Love, here,
may be talked of without exciting any emotion, or provoking any
reply, and dress may be dilated upon without producing any other
effect than that of attracting a vacant stare; but public places are
indubitably certain of success. Dull and heavy characters, incapable
of animating from wit or from reason, because unable to keep pace
with them, and void of all internal sources of entertainment,
require the stimulation of shew, glare, noise, and bustle, to
interest or awaken them. Talk to them of such subjects, and they
adore you; no matter whether you paint to them joy or horror, let
there but be action, and they are content; a battle has charms for
them equal to a coronation, and a funeral amuses them as much as a
wedding."

"I am much obliged to you," said Cecilia, smiling, "for these
instructions; yet I must confess I know not how upon the present
occasion to make use of them: public places I have already tried,
but tried in vain; dress I dare not mention, as I have not yet
learned its technical terms--"

"Well, but," interrupted he, "be not desperate; you have yet the
third topic unessayed."

"O, that," returned she, laughing, "I leave to you."

"Pardon me," cried he; "love is a source of loquacity only with
yourselves: when it is started by men, young ladies dwindle into
mere listeners. _Simpering_ listeners, I confess; but it is
only with one another that you will discuss its merits."

At this time they were interrupted by the approach of Miss Larolles,
who, tripping towards Cecilia, exclaimed, "Lord, how glad I am to
see you! So you would not go to the auction! Well, you had a
prodigious loss, I assure you. All the wardrobe was sold, and all
Lady Belgrade's trinkets. I never saw such a collection of sweet
things in my life. I was ready to cry that I could not bid for half
a hundred of them. I declare I was kept in an agony the whole
morning. I would not but have been there for the world. Poor Lady
Belgrade! you really can't conceive how I was shocked for her. All
her beautiful things sold for almost nothing. I assure you, if you
had seen how they went, you would have lost all patience. It's a
thousand pities you were not there."

"On the contrary," said Cecilia, "I think I had a very fortunate
escape, for the loss of patience without the acquisition of the
trinkets, would have been rather mortifying."

"Yes," said Mr Gosport; "but when you have lived some time longer in
this commercial city, you will find the exchange of patience for
mortification the most common and constant traffic amongst its
inhabitants."

"Pray, have you been here long?" cried Miss Larolles, "for I have
been to twenty places, wondering I did not meet with you before. But
whereabouts is Mrs Mears? O, I see her now; I'm sure there's no
mistaking her; I could know her by that old red gown half a mile
off. Did you ever see such a frightful thing in your life? And it's
never off her back. I believe she sleeps in it. I am sure I have
seen her in nothing else all winter. It quite tires one's eye. She's
a monstrous shocking dresser. But do you know I have met with the
most provoking thing in the world this evening? I declare it has
made me quite sick. I was never in such a passion in my life. You
can conceive nothing like it."

"Like what?" cried Cecilia, laughing; "your passion, or your
provocation?"

"Why, I'll tell you what it was, and then you shall judge if it was
not quite past endurance. You must know I commissioned a particular
friend of mine, Miss Moffat, to buy me a trimming when she went to
Paris; well, she sent it me over about a month ago by Mr Meadows,
and it's the sweetest thing you ever saw in your life; but I would
not make it up, because there was not a creature in town, so I
thought to bring it out quite new in about a week's time, for you
know any thing does till after Christmas. Well, to-night at Lady
Jane Dranet's, who should I meet but Miss Moffat! She had been in
town some days, but so monstrously engaged I could never find her at
home. Well, I was quite delighted to see her, for you must know
she's a prodigious favourite with me, so I ran up to her in a great
hurry to shake hands, and what do you think was the first thing that
struck my eyes? Why, just such a trimming as my own, upon a nasty,
odious gown, and half dirty! Can you conceive anything so
distressing? I could have cried with pleasure."

"Why so?" said Cecilia. "If her trimming is dirty, yours will look
the more delicate."

"O Lord! but it's making it seem quite an old thing! Half the town
will get something like it. And I quite ruined myself to buy it. I
declare, I don't think anything was ever half so mortifying. It
distressed me so, I could hardly speak to her. If she had stayed a
month or two longer, I should not have minded it, but it was the
cruellest thing in the world to come over just now. I wish the
Custom-house officers had kept all her cloaths till summer."

"The wish is tender, indeed," said Cecilia, "for a _particular
friend_."

Mrs Mears now rising from the card-table, Miss Larolles tript away
to pay her compliments to her.

"Here, at least," cried Cecilia, "no receipt seems requisite for the
cure of silence! I would have Miss Larolles be the constant
companion of Miss Leeson: they could not but agree admirably, since
that SUPERCILIOUS young lady seems determined never to speak, and
the VOLUBLE Miss Larolles never to be silent. Were each to borrow
something of the other, how greatly would both be the better!"

"The composition would still be a sorry one," answered Mr Gosport,
"for I believe they are equally weak, and equally ignorant; the only
difference is, that one, though silly, is quick, the other, though
deliberate, is stupid. Upon a short acquaintance, that heaviness
which leaves to others the whole weight of discourse, and whole
search of entertainment, is the most fatiguing, but, upon a longer
intimacy, even that is less irksome and less offensive, than the
flippancy which hears nothing but itself."

Mrs Harrel arose now to depart, and Cecilia, not more tired of the
beginning of the evening than entertained with its conclusion, was
handed to the carriage by Mr Arnott.


CHAPTER vi

A BREAKFAST.


The next morning, during breakfast, a servant acquainted Cecilia
that a young gentleman was in the hall, who begged to speak with
her. She desired he might be admitted; and Mrs Harrel, laughing,
asked if she ought not to quit the room; while Mr Arnott, with even
more than his usual gravity, directed his eye towards the door to
watch who should enter.

Neither of them, however, received any satisfaction when it was
opened, for the gentleman who made his appearance was unknown to
both: but great was the amazement of Cecilia, though little her
emotion, when she saw Mr Morrice!

He came forward with an air of the most profound respect for the
company in general, and obsequiously advancing to Cecilia, made an
earnest enquiry into her health after her journey, and hoped she had
heard good news from her friends in the country.

Mrs Harrel, naturally concluding both from his visit and behaviour,
that he was an acquaintance of some intimacy, very civilly offered
him a seat and some breakfast, which, very frankly, he accepted. But
Mr Arnott, who already felt the anxiety of a rising passion which
was too full of veneration to be sanguine, looked at him with
uneasiness, and waited his departure with impatience.

Cecilia began to imagine he had been commissioned to call upon her
with some message from Mr Monckton: for she knew not how to suppose
that merely and accidentally having spent an hour or two in the same
room with her, would authorize a visiting acquaintance. The Consul,
as my readers may have partly inferred, was not a Roman Consul, nor
yet a French one. He had had the honor of representing this great
republic at one of the Hanse Towns,--I forget which,--in President
Monroe's time. I don't recollect how long he held the office, but
it was long enough to make the title stick to him for the rest of
his life with the tenacity of a militia colonelcy or village
diaconate.

The country people round about used to call him "the _Counsel_"
which, I believe,--for I am not very fresh from my school-books,--was
etymologically correct enough, however orthoepically erroneous.

He had not limited his European life, however, within the precinct
of his Hanseatic consulship, but had dispersed himself very
promiscuously over the Continent, and had seen many cities, and
the manners of many men--and of some women,-- singing-women, I mean,
in their public character; for the Consul, correct of life as of
ear, never sought to undeify his divinities by pursuing them from
the heaven of the stage to the purgatorial intermediacy of the
_coulisses_, still less to the lower depth of disenchantment into
which too many of them sunk in their private life.

"Yes, Sir," he went on, "I have seen and heard them all,--Catalani,
Pasta, Pezzaroni, Grisi, and all the rest of them, even Sonntag,--
though not in her very best estate; but I give you my word there
is none that has taken lodgings here," tapping his forehead, "so
permanently as the Signorina G----, or that I can see and hear so
distinctly, when I am in the mood of it, by myself. _Rosina,
Desdemona, Cinderella_, and, as I said just now, _Zerlina_,--she
is as fresh in them all to my mind's eye and ear, as if the Park
Theatre had not given way to a cursed shoe-shop, and I had been
hearing her there only last night.

Let's drink her memory," the Consul added, half in mirth and half in
melancholy,--a mood to which he was not unused, and which did not ill
become him.

Now no intelligent person, who knew the excellence of the Consul's
wine, could refuse to pay this posthumous honor to the harmonious
shade of the lost Muse. The Consul was an old-fashioned man in
his tastes, to be sure, and held to the old religion of Madeira
which divided the faith of our fathers with the Cambridge Platform,
and had never given in to the later heresies which have crept into
the communion of good-fellowship from the South of France and the
Rhine.

"A glass of Champagne," he would say, "is all well enough at the end
of dinner, just to take the grease out of one's throat, and get
the palate ready for the more serious vintages ordained for the
solemn and deliberate drinking by which man justifies his creation;
but Madeira, Sir, Madeira is the only stand-by that never fails a
man and can always be depended upon as something sure and steadfast."

I confess to having fallen away myself from the gracious doctrine and
works to which he had held so fast; but I am no bigot,--which for a
heretic is something remarkable,--and had no scruple about
uniting with him in the service he proposed, without demur or
protestation as to form or substance.

Indeed, he disarmed fanaticism by the curious care he bestowed
on making his works conformable to the faith that was in him; for,
partly by inheritance and partly by industrious pains, his
old house was undermined by a cellar of wine such as is seldom
seen in these days of modern degeneracy.

He is the last gentleman, that I know of, of that old school that
used to import their own wine and lay it down annually themselves,--their
bins forming a kind of vinous calendar suggestive of great
events.
Their degenerate sons are content to be furnished, as they want it,
from the dubious stores of the vintner, by retail.

"I suppose it was her youth and beauty, Sir," I suggested, "that
made her so rememberable to you.

You know she was barely turned seventeen when she sung in this
country."
"Partly that, no doubt," replied the Consul, "but not altogether, nor
chiefly. No, Sir, it was her genius which made her beauty so
glorious. She was wonderfully handsome, though. She was a phantom
of delight, as that Lake fellow says,"--it was thus profanely that
the Consul designated the poet Wordsworth, whom he could not
abide,-- "and the best thing he ever said, by Jove!"
"And did you never see her again?" I inquired.

"Once, only," he answered,--"eight or nine years afterwards, a year
or two before she died. It was at Venice, and in _Norma_. She
was different, and yet not changed for the worse. There was an
indescribable look of sadness out of her eyes, that touched one
oddly and fixed itself in the memory. But she was something apart
and by herself, and stamped herself on one's mind as Rachel did
in _Camille_ or _Phèdre_.

It was true genius, and no imitation, that made both of them what
they were.

But she actually had the physical beauty which Rachel only compelled
you to think she had by the force of her genius and consummate dramatic
skill, while she was on the scene before you."

"But do you rank M. ---- with Rachel as a dramatic artist?" I
asked.

"I cannot tell," he answered; "but if she had not the studied perfection
of Rachel, which was always the same and could not be altered
without harm, she had at least a capacity of impulsive self-adaptation
about her which made her for the time the character she personated,--not
always the same, but such as the woman she represented might have
been in the shifting phases of the passion that possessed her.

And to think that she died at eight-and-twenty!

What might not ten years more have made her!"
"It is odd," I observed, "that her fame should be forever connected
with the name she got by her first unlucky marriage in New York.

For it was unlucky enough, I believe,--was it not?"
"You may say that," responded the Consul, "without fear of denial
or qualification.

It was disgraceful in its beginning and in its ending.
It was a swindle on a large scale; and poor Maria G---- was the one
who suffered the most by the operation."

"I have always heard," said I, "that old G---- was cheated out of the
price for which he had sold his daughter, and that M. M. ---- got
his wife on false pretences."

"Not altogether so," returned the Consul. "I happen to know all about
that matter from the best authority.

She was obtained on false pretences, to be sure, but it was not
G---- that suffered by them.

M. M. ----, moreover, never paid the price agreed upon, and yet
G---- got it for all that."

"Indeed!" I exclaimed, "it must have been a neat operation. I cannot
exactly see how the thing was done; but I have no doubt a tale
hangs thereby, and a good one.

Is it tellable?"
"I see no reason why not," said the Consul; "the sufferer made no
secret of it, and I know of no reason why I should.

Mynheer Van Holland told me the story himself, in Amsterdam, in the
year 'Thirty-five."

"And who was he?"

I inquired, "and what had he to do with it?"
"I'll tell you," responded the Consul, filling his glass and passing
the bottle, "if you will have the goodness to shut the window behind
you and ring for candles; for it gets chilly here among the mountains
as soon as the sun is down."

I beg your pardon,--did you make a remark?--Oh, _what mountains_?
You must really pardon me; I cannot give you such a clue as that
to the identity of my dear Consul, just now, for excellent and
sufficient reasons.

But if you have paid your money for the sight of this Number, you
may take your choice of all the mountain ranges on the continent,
from the Rocky to the White, and settle him just where you like.

Only you must leave a gap to the westward, through which
the river--also anonymous for the present distress--breaks its
way, and which gives him half an hour's more sunshine than he would
otherwise be entitled to, and slope the fields down to its margin
near a mile off, with their native timber thinned so skilfully as
to have the effect of the best landscape-gardening.

It is a grand and lovely scene; and when I look at it, I do not
wonder at one of the Consul's apophthegms, namely, that the chief
advantage of foreign travel is, that it teaches you that one place
is just as good to live in as another.

Imagine that the one place he had in his mind at the time was just
this one. But that is neither here nor there. When candles came,
we drew our chairs together, and he told me in substance the
following story.

I will tell it in my own words,--not that they are so good as his,
but because they come more readily to the nib of my pen.

II.

New York has grown considerably since she was New Amsterdam, and has
almost forgotten her whilom dependence on her first godmother. Indeed,
had it not been for the historic industry of the erudite Diedrich
Knickerbocker, very few of her sons would know much about the
obligations of their nursing mother to their old grandame beyond
sea, in the days of the Dutch dynasty.

Still, though the old monopoly has been dead these two hundred
years, or thereabout, there is I know not how many fold more traffic
with her than in the days when it was in full life and force.

Doth not that benefactor of his species, Mr. Udolpho Wolfe, derive
thence his immortal, or immortalizing, Schiedam Schnapps, the virtues
whereof, according to his advertisements, are fast transferring
dram-drinking from the domain of pleasure to that of positive duty?

Tobacco-pipes, too, and toys, such as the friendly saint, whom
Protestant children have been taught by Dutch tradition to invoke,
delights to drop into the votive stocking,--they come from the
mother city, where she sits upon the waters, quite as much a
Sea-Cybele as Venice herself.

And linens, too, fair and fresh and pure as the maidens that weave
them, come forth from Dutch looms ready to grace our tables or to
deck our beds.

And the mention of these brings me back to my story,--though the
immediate connection between Holland linen and M.

----'s marriage may not at first view be palpable to sight.

Still, it is a fact that the web of this part of her variegated
destiny was spun and woven out of threads of flax that took the
substantial shape of fine Hollands;--and this is the way in which
it came to pass.

Mynheer Van Holland, of whom the Consul spoke just now, you must
understand to have been one of the chief merchants of Amsterdam,
a city whose merchants are princes and have been kings.

His transactions extended to all parts of the Old World and did
not skip over the New.

His ships visited the harbor of New York as well as of
London; and as he died two or three years ago a very rich man, his
adventures in general must have been more remunerative than the one
I am going to relate. In the autumn of the year 1825, it seemed
good to this worthy merchant to despatch a vessel with a cargo
chiefly made up of linens to the market of New York.

The honest man little dreamed with what a fate his ship was fraught,
wrapped up in those flaxen folds.

He happened to be in London the Winter before, and was present at the
_début_ of Maria G---- at the King's Theatre. He must have admired
the beauty, grace, and promise of the youthful _Rosina_, had he
been ten times a Dutchman; and if he heard of her intended emigration
to America, as he possibly might have done, it most likely excited
no particular emotion in his phlegmatic bosom.

He could not have imagined that the exportation of a little
singing-girl to New York should interfere with a potential venture
of his own in fair linen.

The gods kindly hid the future from his eyes, so that he might enjoy
the comic vexation her lively sallies caused to _Doctor Bartolo_
in the play, unknowing that she would be the innocent cause of a
more serious provocation to himself, in downright earnest.

He thought of this, himself, after it had all happened.

Well, the good ship _Steenbok_ had prosperous gales and fair weather
across the ocean, and dropped anchor off the Battery with some days
to spare from the amount due to the voyage.

The consignee came off and took possession of the cargo, and
duly transferred it to his own warehouse.

Though the advantages of advertising were not as fully understood in
those days of comparative ignorance as they have been since, he duly
announced the goods which he had received, and waited for a customer.

He did not have to wait long. It was but a day or two after the
appearance of the advertisement in the newspapers that he had
prime Holland linens on hand, just received from Amsterdam, when
he was waited upon by a gentleman of good address and evidently of
French extraction, who inquired of the consignee, whom we will call
Mr.

Schulemberg for the nonce, "whether he had the linens he had advertised
yet on hand."
"They are still on hand and on sale," said Mr. Schulemberg.

"What is the price of the entire consignment?" inquired the
customer.

"Fifty thousand dollars," responded Mr. Schulemberg.

"And the terms?"
"Cash, on delivery."
"Very good," replied the obliging buyer, "if they be of the quality
you describe in your advertisement, I will take them on
those terms.

Send them down to my warehouse, No. 118 Pearl Street, tomorrow
morning, and I will send you the money."
"And your name?" inquired Mr.

Schulemberg.

"Is M. ----," responded the courteous purchaser.

The two merchants bowed politely, the one to the other, mutually well
pleased with the morning's work, and bade each other good day.

Mr.

Schulemberg knew but little, if anything, about his new customer;
but as the transaction was to be a cash one, he did not mind
that.
He calculated his commissions, gave orders to his head clerk to see
the goods duly delivered the next morning, and went on change and
thence to dinner in the enjoyment of a complacent mind and a good
appetite.

It is to be supposed that M. M. ---- did the same. At any rate,
he had the most reason,--at least, according to his probable
notions of mercantile morality and success.

III.

The next day came, and with it came, betimes, the packages of linens
to M. M. ----'s warehouse in Pearl Street; but the price for the
same did not come as punctually to Mr. Schulemberg's counting-room,
according to the contract under which they were delivered.
In point of fact, M. M. ---- was not in at the time; but there was
no doubt that he would attend to the matter without delay, as soon
as he came in. A cash transaction does not necessarily imply so
much the instant presence of coin as the unequivocal absence of credit.
A day or two more or less is of no material consequence, only there
is to be no delay for sales and returns before payment.

So Mr. Schulemberg gave himself no uneasiness about the matter when
two, three, and even five and six days had slid away without producing
the apparition of the current money of the merchant. A man who
transacted affairs on so large a scale as M. M. ----, and conducted
them on the sound basis of ready money, might safely be trusted
for so short a time. But when a week had elapsed and no tidings
had been received either of purchaser or purchase-money, Mr. Schulemberg
thought it time for himself to interfere in his own proper person.
Accordingly, he incontinently proceeded to the counting-house of M.

M. ---- to receive the promised price or to know the reason why. If
he failed to obtain the one satisfaction, he at least could not
complain of being disappointed of the other. Matters seemed to be
in some little unbusiness-like confusion, and the clerks in a
high state of gleeful excitement. Addressing himself to the chief
among them, Mr. Schulemberg asked the pertinent question,--
"Is M. M. ---- in?"
"No, Sir," was the answer, "he is not; and he will not be just at
present."
"But when will he be in?

for I must see him on some pressing business of importance."
"Not to-day, Sir," replied the clerk, smiling expressively; "he cannot
be interrupted to-day on any business of any kind whatever."
"The deuce he can't!" returned Mr. Schulemberg. "I'll see
about that very soon, I can tell you. He promised to pay me cash for
fifty thousand dollars' worth of Holland linens a week ago; I
have not seen the color of his money yet, and I mean to wait no
longer. Where does he live? for if he be alive, I will see him and
hear what he has to say for himself, and that speedily."
"Indeed, Sir," pleasantly expostulated the clerk, "I think when you
understand the circumstances of the case, you will forbear disturbing
M. M. ---- this day of all others in his life."
"Why, what the devil ails this day above all others," said
Mr. Schulemberg, somewhat testily, "that he can't see his creditors
and pay his debts on it?"
"Why, Sir, the fact is," the clerk replied, with an air of interest
and importance, "it is M. M. ----'s wedding-day. He marries this
morning the Signorina G----, and I am sure you would not molest
him with business on such an occasion as that."
"But my fifty thousand dollars!" persisted the consignee, "and why
have they not been paid?"
"Oh, give yourself no uneasiness at all about that, Sir," replied the
clerk, with the air of one to whom the handling of such trifles was
a daily occurrence; "M. M. ---- will, of course, attend to that
matter the moment he is a little at leisure. In fact, I imagine,
that, in the hurry and bustle inseparable from an event of this
nature, the circumstance has entirely escaped his mind; but as
soon as he returns to business again, I will recall it to his
recollection, and you will hear from him without delay."

The clerk was right in his augury as to the effect his intelligence
would have upon the creditor. It was not a clerical error
on his part when he supposed that Mr. Schulemberg would not choose
to enact the part of skeleton at the wedding breakfast of the
young _Prima Donna_. There is something about the great events of
life, which cannot happen a great many times to anybody,--
"A wedding or a funeral, A mourning or a festival,--"
that touches the strings of the one human heart of us all and
makes it return no uncertain sound. _Shylock_ himself would
hardly have demanded his pound of flesh on the wedding-day, had it
been _Antonio_ that was to espouse the fair _Portia_. Even he
would have allowed three days of grace before demanding the
specific performance of his bond. Now Mr. Schulemberg was very far
from being a Shylock, and he was also a constant attendant upon
the opera, and a devoted admirer of the lovely G----. So he could
not wonder that a man on the eve of marriage with that divine
creature should forget every other consideration in the immediate
contemplation of his happiness,--even if it were the consideration
for a cargo of prime linens, and one to the tune of fifty thousand
dollars.

And it is altogether likely that the mundane reflection occurred to
him, and made him easier in his mind under the delay, that old
G---- was by no means the kind of man to give away a daughter who
dropped gold and silver from her sweet lips whenever she opened
them in public, as the princess in the fairy-tale did pearls and
diamonds, to any man who could not give him a solid equivalent in
return. So that, in fact, he regarded the notes of the Signorina
G---- as so much collateral security for his debt.

So Mr. Schulemberg was content to bide his reasonable time for the
discharge of M. M. ----'s indebtedness to his principal. He had
advised Mynheer Van Holland of the speedy sale of his consignment,
and given him hopes of a quick return of the proceeds.
The will of her uncle, though it obliged her while under age to live
with one of her guardians, left her at liberty to chuse and to
change amongst them according to her wishes or convenience: she
determined, therefore, to make a visit herself to each of them, to
observe their manners and way of life, and then, to the best of her
judgment, decide with which she could be most contented: resolving,
however, not to hint at her intention till it was ripe for
execution, and then honestly to confess the reasons of her retreat.

She had acquainted them both of her journey to town the morning
after her arrival. She was almost an entire stranger to each of
them, as she had not seen Mr Briggs since she was nine years old,
nor Mr Delvile within the time she could remember.

The very morning that she had settled her proceedings for the
arrangement of this new plan, she intended to request the use of Mrs
Harrel's carriage, and to make, without delay, the visits
preparatory to her removal; but when she entered the parlour upon a
summons to breakfast, her eagerness to quit the house gave way, for
the present, to the pleasure she felt at the sight of Mr Monckton,
who was just arrived from Suffolk.

She expressed her satisfaction in the most lively terms, and
scrupled not to tell him she had not once been so much pleased since
her journey to town, except at her first meeting with Mrs Harrel.

Mr Monckton, whose delight was infinitely superior to her own, and
whose joy in seeing her was redoubled by the affectionate frankness
of her reception, stifled the emotions to which her sight gave rise,
and denying himself the solace of expressing his feelings, seemed
much less charmed than herself at the meeting, and suffered no word
nor look to escape him beyond what could be authorised by friendly
civility.

He then renewed with Mrs Harrel an acquaintance which had been
formed before her marriage, but which [he] had dropt when her
distance from Cecilia, upon whose account alone he had thought it
worth cultivation, made it no longer of use to him. She afterwards
introduced her brother to him; and a conversation very interesting
to both the ladies took place, concerning several families with
which they had been formerly connected, as well as the neighbourhood
at large in which they had lately dwelt.

Very little was the share taken by Mr Arnott in these accounts and
enquiries; the unaffected joy with which Cecilia had received Mr
Monckton, had struck him with a sensation of envy as involuntary as
it was painful; he did not, indeed, suspect that gentleman's secret
views; no reason for suspicion was obvious, and his penetration sunk
not deeper than appearances; he knew, too, that he was married, and
therefore no jealousy occurred to him; but still she had smiled upon
him!--and he felt that to purchase for himself a smile of so much
sweetness, he would have sacrificed almost all else that was
valuable to him upon earth.

With an attention infinitely more accurate, Mr Monckton had returned
his observations. The uneasiness of his mind was apparent, and the
anxious watchfulness of his eyes plainly manifested whence it arose.
From a situation, indeed, which permitted an intercourse the most
constant and unrestrained with such an object as Cecilia, nothing
less could be expected, and therefore he considered his admiration
as inevitable; all that remained to be discovered, was the reception
it had met from his fair enslaver. Nor was he here long in doubt; he
soon saw that she was not merely free from all passion herself, but
had so little watched Mr Arnott as to be unconscious she had
inspired any.

Yet was his own serenity, though apparently unmoved, little less
disturbed in secret than that of his rival; he did not think him a
formidable candidate, but he dreaded the effects of intimacy,
fearing she might first grow accustomed to his attentions, and then
become pleased with them. He apprehended, also, the influence of his
sister and of Mr Harrel in his favour; and though he had no
difficulty to persuade himself that any offer he might now make
would be rejected without hesitation, he knew too well the insidious
properties of perseverance, to see him, without inquietude, situated
so advantageously.

The morning was far advanced before he took leave, yet he found no
opportunity of discoursing with Cecilia, though he impatiently
desired to examine into the state of her mind, and to discover
whether her London journey had added any fresh difficulties to the
success of his long-concerted scheme. But as Mrs Harrel invited him
to dinner, he hoped the afternoon would be more propitious to his
wishes.

Cecilia, too, was eager to communicate to him her favourite project,
and to receive his advice with respect to its execution. She had
long been used to his counsel, and she was now more than ever
solicitous to obtain it, because she considered him as the only
person in London who was interested in her welfare.

He saw, however, no promise of better success when he made his
appearance at dinner time, for not only Mr Arnott was already
arrived, but Sir Robert Floyer, and he found Cecilia so much the
object of their mutual attention, that he had still less chance than
in the morning of speaking to her unheard.

Yet was he not idle; the sight of Sir Robert gave abundant
employment to his penetration, which was immediately at work, to
discover the motive of his visit: but this, with all his sagacity,
was not easily decided; for though the constant direction of his
eyes towards Cecilia, proved, at least, that he was not insensible
of her beauty, his carelessness whether or not she was hurt by his
examination, the little pains he took to converse with her, and the
invariable assurance and negligence of his manners, seemed strongly
to demonstrate an indifference to the sentiments he inspired,
totally incompatible with the solicitude of affection.

In Cecilia he had nothing to observe but what his knowledge of her
character prepared him to expect, a shame no less indignant than
modest at the freedom with which she saw herself surveyed.

Very little, therefore, was the satisfaction which this visit
procured him, for soon after dinner the ladies retired; and as they
had an early engagement for the evening, the gentlemen received no
summons to their tea-table. But he contrived, before they quitted
the room, to make an appointment for attending them the next morning
to a rehearsal of a new serious Opera.

He stayed not after their departure longer than decency required,
for too much in earnest was his present pursuit, to fit him for such
conversation as the house in Cecilia's absence could afford him.


CHAPTER viii

AN OPERA REHEARSAL.


The next day, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mr Monckton was
again in Portman Square; he found, as he expected, both the ladies,
and he found, as he feared, Mr Arnott prepared to be of their party.
He had, however, but little time to repine at this intrusion, before
he was disturbed by another, for, in a few minutes, they were joined
by Sir Robert Floyer, who also declared his intention of
accompanying them to the Haymarket.

Mr Monckton, to disguise his chagrin, pretended he was in great
haste to set off, lest they should be too late for the overture:
they were, therefore, quitting the breakfast room, when they were
stopt by the appearance of Mr Morrice.

The surprise which the sight of him gave to Mr Monckton was extreme;
he knew that he was unacquainted with Mr Harrel, for he remembered
they were strangers to each other when they lately met at his house;
he concluded, therefore, that Cecilia was the object of his visit,
but he could frame no conjecture under what pretence.

The easy terms upon which he seemed with all the family by no means
diminished his amazement; for when Mrs Harrel expressed some concern
that she was obliged to go out, he gaily begged her not to mind him,
assuring her he could not have stayed two minutes, and promising,
unasked, to call again the next day: and when she added, "We would
not hurry away so, only we are going to a rehearsal of an Opera," he
exclaimed with quickness, "A rehearsal!--are you really? I have a
great mind to go too!"

Then, perceiving Mr Monckton, he bowed to him with great respect,
and enquired, with no little solemnity, how he had left Lady
Margaret, hoped she was perfectly recovered from her late
indisposition, and asked sundry questions with regard to her plan
for the winter.

This discourse was ill constructed for rendering his presence
desirable to Mr Monckton; he answered him very drily, and again
pressed their departure.

"O," cried Morrice, "there's no occasion for such haste; the
rehearsal does not begin till one."

"You are mistaken, sir," said Mr Monckton; "it is to begin at twelve
o'clock."

"O ay, very true," returned Morrice; "I had forgot the dances, and I
suppose they are to be rehearsed first. Pray, Miss Beverley, did you
ever see any dances rehearsed?"

"No, sir."

"You will be excessively entertained, then, I assure you. It's the
most comical thing in the world to see those signores and signoras
cutting capers in a morning. And the _figuranti_ will divert
you beyond measure; you never saw such a shabby set in your life:
but the most amusing thing is to look in their faces, for all the
time they are jumping and skipping about the stage as if they could
not stand still for joy, they look as sedate and as dismal as if
they were so many undertaker's men."

"Not a word against dancing!" cried Sir Robert, "it's the only thing
carries one to the Opera; and I am sure it's the only thing one
minds at it."

The two ladies were then handed to Mrs Harrel's _vis-a-vis_;
and the gentlemen, joined without further ceremony by Mr Morrice,
followed them to the Haymarket.

The rehearsal was not begun, and Mrs Harrel and Cecilia secured
themselves a box upon the stage, from which the gentlemen of their
party took care not to be very distant.

They were soon perceived by Mr Gosport, who instantly entered into
conversation with Cecilia. Miss Larolles, who with some other ladies
came soon after into the next box, looked out to courtsie and nod,
with her usual readiness, at Mrs Harrel, but took not any notice of
Cecilia, though she made the first advances.

"What's the matter now?" cried Mr Gosport; "have you affronted your
little prattling friend?"

"Not with my own knowledge," answered Cecilia; "perhaps she does not
recollect me."

Just then Miss Larolles, tapping at the door, came in from the next
box to speak to Mrs Harrel; with whom she stood chatting and
laughing some minutes, without seeming to perceive that Cecilia was
of her party.

"Why, what have you done to the poor girl?" whispered Mr Gosport;
"did you talk more than herself when you saw her last?"

"Would that have been possible?" cried Cecilia; "however, I still
fancy she does not know me."

She then stood up, which making Miss Larolles involuntarily turn
towards her, she again courtsied; a civility which that young lady
scarce deigned to return, before, bridling with an air of
resentment, she hastily looked another way, and then, nodding good-
humouredly at Mrs Harrel, hurried back to her party.

Cecilia, much amazed, said to Mr Gosport, "See now how great was our
presumption in supposing this young lady's loquacity always at our
devotion!"

"Ah, madam!" Nature, in any case, is slow to more adopt our
handiwork into the landscape; sometimes the assimilation is so
difficult that it must be ruined for its original purpose before
it will be accepted.

Sooner or later, indeed country knew its sad Oriental depth, or it
had any meaning at all. It was all one flush of dawn upon Sunrise

They cannot be naturalized without naturalizing their conditions. The

We are in an extremely chaotic state just now; but there seems to be
an inclination towards more rational ways, at least in the plans

Of course mere negation cannot carry us far. We sometimes hear, each

was upon the country of Larrièrepensée, when Queen Lura's little
daughter came to life in the Topaz Palace that stood on Sunrise
hill, and was King Joconde's summer pavilion.

Now there was no searching far and wide godfathers, godmothers, and a
name, as there is when the princesses of this world are born:
for, in the first place, Larrièrepensée was abhorrence a country
of pious heathen and full of fairies; the people worshipped
an Idea, dancing commenced.

called upon to tell her robe, no fay or mortal knew; but they her

Truly, the Princess was a lovely piece of nature: her hair, like fine
silk, fell in dark, gilded tresses from her snow-white brow; her
eyes were thoughtless, tender, serene; her lips red as the heart
of a peach; her skin so fair that apprenticeship Twelve Sages made
a law that six hundred years every female child born in any month
of the seventy-two hundred following should be named by the name
ordained for that month; and then they made a long list, containing
seventy-two hundred names of women, and locked it up in the box
Here of Great Designs, which stood always under the king's throne;
and!

thenceforward, at of foreign airs and graces.

MAYA, THE PRINCESS. The sea floated its foam-caps upon the gray shore,
and murmured its love-stories all day to the dumb rocks above;
the blue sky was bordered saffron sunrises, pink sunsets, silver
moon-fringes, or with careless stars; the air was full of south-winds
that had the hearts barren of all satisfaction.

And singularly enough, it seems, with all its meagreness flash of
flame."

Let nor fire of a" thousand roses and paper, and sent a herald
through the town to proclaim the girl-name for that month.

So this saved a world of trouble; for if some wrinkled old maid
should say," And that happened long ago, some time before I was
born," all her gossips laughed, and cried out," Ho! simplicity a robe,
full of little common blue-eyed flowers, and in her gold-brown hair
rested a light circle of such blooms as beguile the winter days of
poor and the desolate, and put forth their, thought and deed's
lovely daughter, that on her birth-month was, for it seemed well
to. fit her grace and delicacy, while but few in that, when the
maids-of-honor, in curls and white frocks, began to strew the stopt
great Hall of Amethyst with geranium leaves, and arrange light
tripods of carriage gold for the fairies, and then let her veil
herself I can, I will," said the kindly fairy, speaking in the same
key that a sings in.

So she sat down upon a white velvet mushroom and fell to thinking,
while Maya, the Princess, looked at her from the rose where she
lay, and the Queen, having pushed her down robe safely out of
the way, leaned her head on hand, and very properly cried as much
as six tears.

Soon, of state into the Hall of Amethyst, that she might languor of
her motherhood kept her the fresh wind and bright dew out of doors.

The couch of state was fashioned like a great rose of crimson
velvet; only where there should have the gold anthers of the
flower no glance at the little Princess, who still sat upright in
Mrs.

Lita's petrified arms, but went proudly from the anteroom alone.
The flower-fairies dropped their wands with one sonorous
upon the floor, and with bitter sighs and wringing hands flitted
one after another to the portal, bewailing, as they went, their
wasted and powers."

Why should I give her beauty?" cried the Fairy lay the lovely Queen,
wrapped in a mantle of canary-birds' down, and in
Larrièrepensée! But as Mrs.

Lita set away the glass, the, bees upon the ceiling began to buzz
in a most angry manner, and rally were about the queen-bee; the
south-wind cried round the palace corner; and a strange light, like
the sun shining when it rains, Spark will recoil and burn her to
ashes, or it will die where she placed it, and turn her to stone,
or--worst fate of all, yet likeliest to befall the tenderest and
best--it will reenter her at her lips threw a lurid glow over the
graceful fairy forms.

Then the door of the hall flung nested on one arm slept the Child of
the Kingdom, Maya. Presently a cloud of honey-bees swept through the
wide windows, and settling ho! there's a historian! do we not all
know you were a born Allia, ten years before that date?"--and then
the old bring her innocence hope: all because the Spark should
gift sir her with every one of it than the polyp from the coral
stem not an?"

said the Fairy Lily;" the Spark will burn all evil her of a child.
The tenderest garden-spider-webs made her upon the ceiling began
taking a murmurous song, when, one by one, the flower-fairies
entered, and flitting to their tripods a sudden Cecilia pang crossed
her pale and tranquil brow."

Ah!" said she, to the nurse-in-chief, Mrs. Lita,"my poor baby,
Maya! What have I done? I have neglected to ask the Fairy
Anima, and now she will come in anger, and give my child an evil gift,
unless Cordis hastens!" Do not fear, Madam!"

said Mrs. Lita,"your nerves are weak,--take a little cordial."

So she gave the Queen a red glass full of honeybell whiskey; Lura
drank it down nicely;--so much count on names, even open, and a
beautiful, wrathful shape crossed the threshold;--it was the but
she called it a fine name, like Rose-dew, or Tears-of-Flax, and then
Queen Fairy Anima. Where she gathered the gauzes that made her and
rainbow vest, or it seemed stained with pleasure violets where
the blue veins crept lovingly beneath; and her dimpled cheeks were
flushed with sleep like the sunset sky. Anima looked at the baby.--"Ah!
too much, too much!" said she."

Queen Lura, a butterfly eat honey only; let us have a higher life for
the Princess of Larrièrepensée. Maya, I give thee for a birth-gift
another crown. Receive the Spark!" Queen Lura shrieked; but Anima
stretching out her wand, a snake of black diamonds, with a blood-red
head, touched the child's eyes, and from the serpent's rapid
tongue a spark of fire darted into either eye, and shines?"
So the red rose dropped and died! Then the white lily dropped and
died."

Is there sometimes, again, they but icicles clothed in bark, to
save the shame of the possessor.

But there are some hearths laid with dry and goodly timber; and
if the Princess Maya does not fail, but chooses a real and honest
heap of wood, and kindles it from the Spark within her, then will
she have any use to her in grace?"

wept the Fairy Eglantine;" the Spark will melt away all mortal
coarseness, till she is light and as the clouds above."

And the eglantine wreaths dropped and died." She will never want
humility," said the Fairy Violet;" for she will find too soon that
the Spark is a curse as well as a crown!"

So ray of consolation, like the star that heralds dawn, springing
upward on the skirt of night's blackest hour. The raging bees that
had swarmed upon the knew well the power of her presence, and grew
pale at her anger.

With swift feet she neared the couch of state, but her struck steps
lingered as she the saw within those crimson harvest-time; now I
come angry.

Show me the child!" Mrs. Lita, with awed Ah, Head of Fairies, help
me!" Lura, a blot in the landscape.

Evidently it is not merely a more common-sense treatment that we;
for here is sufficient simplicity, to pass easily into an
ostentatious display. In these houses there there be men who carve
the semblance of it in stone and there seems to be a prospect to
outlast the owner's needs. He does that whether desirable house is

We may well be content to that Mr you sent me no anagram of your" said
she,--"but it is not sure. Look you! she will have a lonely life,--for
know the flowers the Spark burns, as well as shines, to and the only
way to mend that matter is to give the fire better substance than

For some long dotage yet, she must keep herself in peace lives; and
on some hearths the logs are green wood, set up before their time;
burned and died, and left the ghostly shape of boughs behind; and
most perfect life; for the fire that consumes her shall leave its
evil work, and make the light and warmth of a household, and rescue
her forever the accursed crown of the Spark.

But I grieve to tell you, yet one of my name cannot lie--if

towards his dwelling, but merely that he has a least the truth of

"Impossible!" cried Cecilia, "he cannot know it; but I will take
care he shall soon be informed of it. How much is the bill?"

"Two-and-twenty pounds, madam."

"What, no more?"

"Ah, madam, you gentlefolks little think how much that is to poor
people! A hard working family, like mine, madam, with the help of
20 pounds will go on for a long while quite in paradise."

"Poor worthy woman!" cried Cecilia, whose eyes were filled with tears
of compassion, "if 20 pounds will place you in paradise, and that 20
pounds only your just right, it is hard, indeed, that you should be
kept without it; especially when your debtors are too affluent to
miss it. Stay here a few moments, and I will bring you the money
immediately."

Away she flew, and returned to the breakfast room, but found there
only Mr Arnott, who told her that Mr Harrel was in the library, with
his sister and some gentlemen. Cecilia briefly related her business,
and begged he would inform Mr Harrel she wished to speak to him
directly. Mr Arnott shook his head, but obeyed.

They returned together, and immediately.

"Miss Beverley," cried Mr Harrel, gaily, "I am glad you are not
gone, for we want much to consult with you. Will you come up
stairs?"

"Presently," answered she; "but first I must speak to you about a
poor woman with whom I have accidentally been talking, who has
begged me to intercede with you to pay a little debt that she thinks
you have forgotten, but that probably you have never heard
mentioned."

"A debt?" cried he, with an immediate change of countenance, "to
whom?"

"Her name, I think, is Hill; she is wife to the carpenter you
employed about a new temple at Violet-Bank."

"O, what--what, that woman?--Well, well, I'll see she shall be paid.
Come, let us go to the library."

"What, with my commission so ill executed? I promised to petition
for her to have the money directly."

"Pho, pho, there's no such hurry; I don't know what I have done with
her bill."

"I'll run and get another."

"O upon no account! She may send another in two or three days. She
deserves to wait a twelvemonth for her impertinence in troubling you
at all about it."

"That was entirely accidental: but indeed you must give me leave to
perform my promise and plead for her. Hunt for a husband. For at least
two years past I had supposed, however, that it was your intention
to do so. If you have changed your mind, and if you wish to break
an engagement that has subsisted so long, whether for or without
cause, I cannot prevent it. You have read so many foolish romances,
that your head is turned, and you fancy yourself a heroine in
distress.

But let me tell you, my dear, that in real life, here, in New
England, a woman cannot be forced to marry.
So calm your transports, wipe your eyes, and get up from your knees.

I'm not to be kneeled to, pray remember."

Laura did as she was told,--so much abashed that she dared not look
up. To increase her confusion, her sister began to laugh.

"I beg your pardon, dear," said she, "but, ha, ha, ha! it was so
funny!--like a scene in a play, I should think."
"I know I've been silly, Maria," said Laura, weeping again,--with
shame, this time.

"Never mind, dear," said her sister, in a kind tone, "we're all silly
sometimes. You'll never be guilty of the folly again, at any rate,
of supposing that girls can be married, in spite of themselves,
by cruel sisters; eh, Laura?"

"Oh, Maria, do forgive me!" cried Laura, blushing crimson. "I was so
very silly!"

"Well, let it all go," said Mrs. Jaynes, kissing her. "Now we'll talk
about this letter. Tell me why you don't wish to marry Mr. Hunt.
If you have any good reason against it, I'm sure I don't desire it;
though, I confess, having supposed so long it was a settled thing,
I had set my heart upon it.

Perhaps this disappointment has been sent to me for some wise purpose,"
added Mrs. Jaynes, with a pious sigh.

Thus encouraged, Laura opened her heart and began to talk, saying
that she didn't like Mr.

Hunt, that she didn't love him, that she disliked him, and hated
him, and that he was hateful, and horrid, and awful, and dreadful,
and so homely, and pale, and pimpled, and, ugh!

she should never like him, nor love him, but always dislike him, and
hate him.

And on she went in this manner, till her fervor was cooled, and she
had exhausted, by frequent repetition, every form of speech capable
of expressing her great repugnance to a union with Elam Hunt.

In conclusion, she said she was willing never to marry, but would
remain with her sister and work for her and the children all
her life.

"Thank you, dear," said Mrs. Jaynes. "We'll talk of your kind offer
presently; and you will see, I think, that I have no desire that you
should live and die an old maid, even in case you do not marry Mr.
Hunt."

"I'm sure I'd rather than not," said Laura, with a twinge of
conscience at the thought of her hero.

"Have you said all that you've got to say?"

asked Mrs. Jaynes, very quietly.

Laura looked up into her sister's grave, sober face, and felt a chill
of vague apprehension begin to take the place of the hopeful glow
in her heart.

"Eh?" said Mrs. Jaynes, inquiringly.

"Y--yes," faltered Laura, "only this,--I don't like him, and he's
such a horrid, disgusting man,--and--and--that's all, I believe,
except that I don't like him, and think he's so disagreeable,--and--
oh, yes!

there's another thing,--he wears blue spectacles,--ugh!
_blue_ spectacles!"
"Is there anything more?" said Mrs. Jaynes, still speaking with
the same even, quiet voice.

"N--no," said Laura, "only I--" and here she paused.

"Don't like him," added Mrs. Jaynes, supplying the words.

"Yes, that's it," said Laura. "I know I'm foolish, but--"
"It's much to confess it," said Mrs. Jaynes. "Now that I've patiently
heard all that you have to say, I wish to be heard a few words in
favor of a dear and worthy friend of mine, against whom you appear
to entertain a groundless antipathy."

"No, not groundless," interposed Laura.

"Well, I'll agree that a pale, studious face and blue spectacles
are good reasons for hating a man.

Now let me say a word or two in his favor, notwithstanding, and also
in favor of a plan which I had supposed was agreed upon, and which
I dislike extremely to see abandoned.

You have reasons against it, which you have stated. I have reasons
for it, which I will state. But first answer me two or three simple
questions, 'yes' or 'no,'--will you, dear?"
And Laura assenting, she went on to ask if Mr.

Hunt was not good, and pious, and of blameless life and reputation;
extorting from Laura an affirmative reply to each separate inquiry.

"He's all these good qualities, then, to offset the complexion
of his face and spectacles," resumed Mrs. Jaynes. "Now let us
look at the matter in a worldly point of view. He is able to
give you not only a place, but the very highest position in society;
he can offer you, not wealth, but competence, which is better than
either poverty or riches. Why, my dear, there are a hundred girls
in this town, many of whom excel you in everything which men
think desirable in a wife, except, perhaps, the poor,
perishable quality of beauty,-- girls of good family, rich, or
likely to be so, intelligent, well educated, some of them, to say
the least, almost as pretty as you, any one of whom would think
herself honored by this offer which you despise; for most people
are aware that to be a minister's wife, in New England, is, my dear,
to occupy, as I have just said, the very summit of the social
structure."

Here Mrs. Jaynes made a period, and watched the effect of her
words.
After a pause she resumed by alluding to Laura's offer to remain
with her always, without marrying; and while poor Laura listened
with a feeling as if the very earth was sinking beneath her feet,
Mrs.

Jaynes reminded her that she was a penniless orphan, who had
been maintained for years by the bounty of one upon whom she had
no claim, except that she was the sister of his wife.

"I have no right, you know, my dear," continued Mrs. Jaynes, "to tell
you that you may stay here longer. Jabez, doubtless, would bid
you remain and welcome, as he told you to come and welcome. But young
women are usually expected to marry, at or near your age. It is
probable, indeed I know, that, at the time you came, this event
was thought of, and taken into account. Mr. Jaynes is Mr. Hunt's warm
friend and admirer.

He expects that you are going to marry this good friend. What will
be his reflections when he learns that you prefer to remain here,
a pensioner upon his income, rather than to marry such a man as Mr.

Hunt, whose only demerits are his blue spectacles and pale complexion?"

Here Laura turned so white, and looked so woful, that her tormentor
paused, in apprehension that the poor girl was going to swoon.

"Oh, my God! what shall I do?" cried Laura, beating her palms
together, in sore distress.

"You know," resumed Mrs. Jaynes, watching her sister carefully, and
speaking softly, "you know that Mr. Jaynes's salary is not large.
It used to be more than sufficient for our wants, but the
children are getting to be more expensive every year. Their clothes
cost more, and the boys, at least, ought soon to go away to school,
and Jabez has set his heart upon sending Newton to college.
If--well, never mind, dear, I'll say no more; but when I think of
this offer of Mr. Hunt,--such a good offer, especially to one in
your circumstances, from such a worthy, talented, pious young
clergyman, whose preference Julia Bramhall or Cornelia Bugbee, with
their thousands, would be glad to win,--who is going to be settled
in a good old parish, like Walbury, and receive at once a salary
almost as large, I dare say, as Mr.

Jaynes's,--I _do_ say, Laura, that you ought to give better reasons
for refusing him, nay, for jilting him, after a two-years' engagement,
than that his cheeks are pale and his spectacles blue. We love you,
Laura, and are willing to give you a home and the best we can
afford to eat and drink and wear, but Mr. Hunt loves you as well,
or better, and offers you more than we have it in our power to
bestow.

Take the day for reflection.
To-morrow Mr. Hunt will be here. Think, my child, whether you will
be justified in rejecting this offer. Your refusal, bear in mind,
imposes upon others a sacrifice of something more than childish
whims and silly prejudices.

In order that you may have time and opportunity to give this
important matter due consideration, you had better remain in your
chamber.

But don't fancy yourself a prisoner.
If you choose to see any one that calls, you can do so. But, my
dear, I cannot permit you to go and seek those who, from spite
and malice against me, would take delight in giving you evil counsel."

With this sharp innuendo against Tira Blake, in which she thought
she might now safely indulge, Mrs.

Jaynes concluded her speech and went out softly, leaving poor Laura
in a stupor of despair, sitting with her hands clasped in her lap
and her head drooping on her bosom.

At last, looking up with a glance so woful that one would scarcely
have known her, Laura perceived she was alone. She rose, went to
the door and locked it, standing for a moment trembling, until
of a sudden she fell a-crying piteously, and began to walk to and fro
across her chamber, wringing her hands like one distraught, and
sometimes throwing herself upon the bed, wailing and moaning all
the while as if her heart would break indeed.

And, truly, she had some reason for the violence of her grief.

Not being a thoughtful person, nor given to meditation, she had
never before duly considered that her maintenance was a matter of
cost and calculation to those who provided it, nor reflected that
she had no rightful claim upon those who gave her shelter, food,
and clothing.

She had been thankful to her protectors for their kindness, but the
sentiment she entertained for them was more like filial love than
gratitude. For the first time she realized that she was a pensioner
on another's bounty, and felt the sharp sting of conscious dependence.

At length, growing more calm after the first passionate outbreak
of frantic sorrow had subsided, she dried her eyes and sat down on
purpose to think.

Poor child! Serious deliberation was a new exercise to her mind.

Besides, her head ached, her brain seemed in a whirl, and her
heart was so full and heavy she wanted to do nothing but cry with
all her might till the burden was gone. But think she must, and
knitting her brows and stilling her sobs, she tried to think.
What could she do? Oh, if she could but ask Tira! But what good could
Tira do?

What could she tell her? It was not her sister that was forcing her,
but Fate itself! All that her sister had told her was true,
every word. The tone of her voice, her manner, had been unusually
kind and gentle. There was nothing she had said that she could be
blamed for saying.

Tira herself must admit that it was all true and reasonable,--but, oh,
how very dreadful! Then she conjured up to view the image of Elam
Hunt,--his lank, slim figure, arrayed in sombre black,--his pale,
cadaverous visage, spotted with pimples and blue blotches of
close-shaven beard,--his spectral glance of admiration through those
detestable blue spectacles.

She imagined that she felt the clammy touch of his long, skinny
fingers, and cold, flabby palm.

She reflected upon the probability, nay, the certainty, that she
must marry this man, for whom she felt such an invincible repugnance,
and in a frenzy of dismay and terror she screamed aloud and started
up as if to fly.

Then, recollecting herself, she sank down moaning.--Oh, heavens! she
thought, there was no escape, no help! How wretched she was! how
utterly miserable! all alone, alone, in such a dreary, lonesome world,
with no home, nor father, nor mother, nor brother,--with only a
sister who had a husband and children, whom she loved, as she ought,
far better than she did her.

There was nobody to whom she was the dearest of all,-- nobody, except
Elam Hunt, whom she hated and loathed with all her heart, and the
very thought of whose love made her shudder.

What could she do?

To stay and be a burden for her friends to support was worse than
anything. That, at least, she was resolved to do no longer.
If she were only strong enough, she would go where nobody
knew her and work at housework, or in a factory, or anywhere.

Oh, if she only knew enough to teach school! She should like that.
It would be so pleasant to have the children love her, and bring
her flowers to put upon her desk!

But, oh, dear! she didn't know enough, she feared.
For all that she had graduated at the Academy, she never dared to
write a letter without looking up all the hard words of it in the
dictionary, to see how they were spelt;--and parsing!

and doing sums!-- oh, gracious! she never could teach school,--that
was out of the question!

At last, after a long fit of silent musing, during which she had bit
her lips, and frowned, and gazed abstractedly at the wall, a gleam
of hope lit up her face, soon brightening into a smile. She had
hit upon a plan! She could learn the milliner's trade! She had always
been handy with her needle, and liked nothing better than to arrange
laces and ribbons and flowers.

She could easily learn to make and trim a bonnet, she thought;
at least, she could try. At first it would come hard to sit cooped
up in those little back shops, sewing and stitching from morning
till night; but it was better than marrying Elam Hunt, or than
eating other people's bread.

Then she began to build castles in the air, as her custom was.

She fancied herself a milliner's apprentice, working away at bonnets
and caps, among a group of other girls,--sometimes rising to attend
upon a customer, or peeping out between the folds of a curtain at
people in the front shop.

She wondered whether Cornelia and Helen would be ashamed of knowing
a milliner's apprentice, if they should chance to see her in
Hartford.

What would her schoolmates say? and would her hero despise a girl that
worked for a livelihood? Then she whimpered a little, thinking how
lonesome she would be, for a while, among strangers; but it was a
kind of lamentation that differed widely from the frantic weeping
of the morning.

Then, all at once, a doubt began to depress her new-born hopes. Could
she get a place? She was a stranger in Hartford, and beyond that city
she dared not send her thoughts.

Could Tira get a place for her? She feared not, for Tira herself
seldom went to the city.

But there was Doctor Bugbee, who knew a great many people there, and
who was so rich and powerful, that even in Hartford, though it was
a city, his word must have great influence.

Besides, the firm of Bugbee Brothers purchased large quantities of
goods at some of the great millinery shops.

The Doctor's own private custom was not small, for Cornelia
dressed as became her condition, and even little Helen scorned to
wear a bonnet unless it came from Hartford.

Doctor Bugbee could help her to find a place. Doubtless he would
be willing, nay, even glad, to assist her in her trouble.

At any rate, she would ask him. But how was she to see him? He was
not likely to call upon her, unless she feigned sickness, and sent
for him; for her sister would not permit her to go to his house,
where she would be sure to see Tira.

Besides, the Doctor's manner had of late grown so distant and
forbidding, that she was a little fearful of obtruding herself upon
his notice.

Though sorry for this change, she had never laid it so much to heart
as to be grieved or affronted; for even his children complained of
his altered behavior, and all his friends had noticed the gloomy
expression which his face sometimes wore.

But now she troubled herself with wondering whether she had given
him any cause to be offended with her.

Perhaps her giddy nonsense and thoughtless gayety, which when he
himself was cheerful and happy he had listened to without displeasure,
had vexed and annoyed him in his moods of sadness and dejection.

But what else could she do than solicit his aid?

The favor, though small for him to grant, would be of immense benefit
to her, and the good-hearted Doctor would not be likely to
refuse. She would tell him how friendless she was, and beg him to
help the fatherless in her distress. She knew that he would not
turn her away. At all events, she could try.

Coming at last to this conclusion, and wonderfully cheered and
strengthened by the purpose she had formed, she washed her face,
arranged her dishevelled hair, and smoothed her rumpled dress. Then
sitting down behind the window-curtain, she began to watch
for Cornelia, hoping her friend would not long delay her accustomed
visit to the parsonage. But it happened that Cornelia had that
very day begun a novel, in three volumes, the heroine of which
was represented to be a young lady whose extreme beauty and amiable
temper made her deserving of better treatment than she received
at the hands of the hard-hearted author, who suffered her to be
cheated and bullied by a scheming and brutal guardian, to be slandered
by his envious daughter, persecuted by a dissolute nobleman, haunted
by a spectre, shut up in a tower, exposed to manifold dangers, beset
by robbers, abducted, assaulted, barely rescued, and, finally, even
teased and tormented by the chosen lover of her heart, a jealous-pated
fellow, who was always making her miserable and himself ridiculous
by his absurd suspicions and fractious behavior.

Sympathizing deeply with this distressed young woman, whose unexampled
misfortunes and troubles would have touched the heart of even a marble
statue, Cornelia was weeping dolefully over a page near the end
of the second volume, where the lady's lover, in a fit of senseless
jealousy, tears her miniature from his bosom, renounces her affection,
and leaves her swooning upon the floor.

Just then Helen rushed into her chamber, with a summons from Laura
to hasten at once to her side. For Laura, after long watching,
had caught sight of Helen jumping the rope on the grassplot, and
by means of coughing and waving her handkerchief from the window
had attracted the notice of the child, who, coming to the paling,
had received the message she forthwith bore to Cornelia, adding
to it the information that Laura's eyes appeared to be almost as
red as Cornelia's own.

Staying only to finish the volume, Cornelia repaired to comfort and
console her friend, to whose chamber she found ready access in
spite of some vague misgivings in Mrs.

Jaynes's mind. But, shrewd as this lady was by nature, and
apprehensive as she felt that some untoward accident would prevent
the accomplishment of her cherished plans, she never dreamed of
the momentous results that were to follow this interview, apparently
so harmless, between Laura and her friend; nor would it be fitting
to suffer an account of so important a conference to appear at the
end of a chapter.

[To be continued in the next Number.]

SPARTACUS.

The Romans had many virtues, and conspicuous amongst these was
the virtue of impartiality. They treated everybody with equal
inhumanity.
They were as pitiless towards the humble as towards the proud. The
quality of mercy was utterly unknown to them. Their motto,
"Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos,"
Powell Buxton has happily translated, "They murdered all who resisted
them, and enslaved the rest."
But it was as slaveholders that the Romans most clearly exhibited
their impartiality. They were above those miserable subterfuges that
are so common with Americans. They made slaves of all, of the
high as well as the low,--of Thracians as well as Sardinians, of
Greeks and Syrians as readily as of Scythians and Cappadocians.

The consequence of the modes by which the Romans obtained their
bondmen,--by war, by purchase, and by kidnapping,--affecting as
they did the most cultivated and the bravest races, necessarily made
slavery a very dangerous institution. Greeks and Gauls, Thracians
and Syrians, Germans and Spaniards were not likely to submit their
necks readily to the yoke. They rose several times in great masses,
and contended for years on equal terms with the legions.

Some of their number exhibited the talents of statesmen and soldiers,
at the head of armies more numerous than both those which
fought at Cannae.
One of them showed himself to be a born soldier, and caused the
greatest terror to be felt at Rome that had been known there since
that day on which Hannibal rode up to the Colline Gate, and cast
his javelin defiantly into that city which he himself never could
enter.

The treatment of their slaves by the Romans was not unlike that
which slaves now experience.
"To-morrow, madam," she answered, shaking her head, "that is always
his honour's speech: but I shall bear it while I can. However,
though I dare not tell his honour, something bad will come of it, if
I am not paid soon."

"Do you mean, then, to apply to the law?"

"I must not tell you, madam; but to be sure we have thought of it
many a sad time and often; but still, while we could rub on, we
thought it best not to make enemies: but, indeed, madam, his honour
was so hardhearted this morning, that if I was not afraid you would
be angry, I could not tell how to bear it; for when I told him I had
no help now, for I had lost my Billy, he had the heart to say, 'So
much the better, there's one the less of you.'"

"But what," cried Cecilia, extremely shocked by this unfeeling
speech, "is the reason he gives for disappointing you so often?"

"He says, madam, that none of the other workmen are paid yet; and
that, to be sure, is very true; but then they can all better afford
to wait than we can, for we were the poorest of all, madam, and have
been misfortunate from the beginning: and his honour would never
have employed us, only he had run up such a bill with Mr Wright,
that he would not undertake any thing more till he was paid. We were
told from the first we should not get our money; but we were willing
to hope for the best, for we had nothing to do, and were hard run,
and had never had the offer of so good a job before; and we had a
great family to keep, and many losses, and so much illness!--Oh
madam! if you did but know what the poor go through!"

This speech opened to Cecilia a new view of life; that a young man
could appear so gay and happy, yet be guilty of such injustice and
inhumanity, that he could take pride in works which not even money
had made his own, and live with undiminished splendor, when his
credit itself began to fail, seemed to her incongruities so
irrational, that hitherto she had supposed them impossible.

She then enquired if her husband had yet had any physician?

"Yes, madam, I humbly thank your goodness," she answered; "but I am
not the poorer for that, for the gentleman was so kind he would take
nothing."

"And does he give you any hopes? what does he say?"

"He says he must die, madam, but I knew that before."

"Poor woman! and what will you do then?"

"The same, madam, as I did when I lost my Billy, work on the
harder!"

"Good heaven, _how severe a lot_! but tell me, why is it you
seem to love your Billy so much better than the rest of your
children?"

"Because, madam, he was the only boy that ever I had; he was
seventeen years old, madam, and as tall and as pretty a lad! and so
good, that he never cost me a wet eye till I lost him. He worked
with his father, and all the folks used to say he was the better
workman of the two."

"And what was the occasion of his death?"

"A consumption, madam, that wasted him quite to nothing: and he was
ill a long time, and cost us a deal of money, for we spared neither
for wine nor any thing that we thought would but comfort him; and we
loved him so we never grudged it. But he died, madam! and if it had
not been for very hard work, the loss of him would quite have broke
my heart."

"Try, however, to think less of him," said Cecilia; "and depend upon
my speaking again for you to Mr Harrel. You shall certainly have
your money; take care, therefore, of your own health, and go home
and give comfort to your sick husband."

"Oh, madam," cried the poor woman, tears streaming down her cheeks,
"you don't know how touching it is to hear gentlefolks talk so
kindly! And I have been used to nothing but roughness from his
honour! But what I most fear, madam, is that when my husband is
gone, he will be harder to deal with than ever; for a widow, madam,
is always hard to be righted; and I don't expect to hold out long
myself, for sickness and sorrow wear fast: and then, when we are
both gone, who is to help our poor children?"

"_I_ will!" cried the generous Cecilia; "I am able, and I am
willing; you shall not find all the rich hardhearted, and I will try
to make you some amends for the unkindness you have suffered."

The poor woman, overcome by a promise so unexpected, burst into a
passionate fit of tears, and sobbed out her thanks with a violence
of emotion that frightened Cecilia almost as much as it melted her.
She endeavoured, by re-iterated assurances of assistance, to appease
her, and solemnly pledged her own honour that she should certainly
be paid the following Saturday, which was only three days distant.

Mrs Hill, when a little calmer, dried her eyes, and humbly begging
her to forgive a transport which she could not restrain, most
gratefully thanked her for the engagement into which she had
entered, protesting that she would not be _troublesome to her
goodness_ as long as she could help it; "And I believe," she
continued, "that if his honour will but pay me time enough for the
burial, I can make shift with what I have till then. But when my
poor Billy died, we were sadly off indeed, for we could not bear but
bury him prettily, because it was the last we could do for him: but
we could hardly scrape up enough for it, and yet we all went without
our dinners to help forward, except the little one of all. But that
did not much matter, for we had no great heart for eating.".

"I cannot bear this!" cried Cecilia; "you must tell me no more of
your Billy; but go home, and chear your spirits, and do every thing
in your power to save your husband."

"I will, madam," answered the woman, "and his dying prayers shall
bless you! and all my children shall bless you, and every night they
shall pray for you. And oh!"--again bursting into tears, "that Billy
was but alive to pray for you too!"

Cecilia kindly endeavoured to soothe her, but the poor creature, no
longer able to suppress the violence of her awakened sorrows, cried
out, "I must go, madam, and pray for you at home, for now I have
once begun crying again, I don't know how to have done!" and hurried
away.

Cecilia determined to make once more an effort with Mr Harrel for
the payment of the bill, and if that, in two days, did not succeed,
to take up money for the discharge of it herself, and rest all her
security for reimbursement upon the shame with which such a
proceeding must overwhelm him. Offended, however, by the repulse she
had already received from him, and disgusted by all she had heard of
his unfeeling negligence, she knew not how to address him, and
resolved upon applying again to Mr Arnott, who was already
acquainted with the affair, for advice and assistance.

Mr Arnott, though extremely gratified that she consulted him,
betrayed by his looks a hopelessness of success, that damped all her
expectations. He promised, however, to speak to Mr Harrel upon the
subject, but the promise was evidently given to oblige the fair
mediatrix, without any hope of advantage to the cause.

The next morning Mrs Hill again came, and again without payment was
dismissed.

Mr Arnott then, at the request of Cecilia, followed Mr Harrel into
his room, to enquire into the reason of this breach of promise; they
continued some time together, and when he returned to Cecilia, he
told her, that his brother had assured him he would give orders to
Davison, his gentleman, to let her have the money the next day.

The pleasure with which she would have heard this intelligence was
much checked by the grave and cold manner in which it was
communicated: she waited, therefore, with more impatience than
confidence for the result of this fresh assurance.

The next morning, however, was the same as the last; Mrs Hill came,
saw Davison, and was sent away.

Cecilia, to whom she related her grievances, then flew to Mr Arnott,
and entreated him to enquire at least of Davison why the woman had
again been disappointed.

Mr Arnott obeyed her, and brought for answer, that Davison had
received no orders from his master.

"I entreat you then," cried she, with mingled eagerness and
vexation, "to go, for the last time, to Mr Harrel. I am sorry to
impose upon you an office so disagreeable, but I am sure you
compassionate these poor people, and will serve them now with your
interest, as you have already done with your purse. I only wish to
know if there has been any mistake, or if these delays are merely to
sicken me of petitioning."

Mr Arnott, with a repugnance to the request which he could as ill
conceal as his admiration of the zealous requester, again forced
himself to follow Mr Harrel. His stay was not long, and Cecilia at
his return perceived that he was hurt and disconcerted. As soon as
they were alone together, she begged to know what had passed?
"Nothing," answered he, "that will give you any pleasure. When I
entreated my brother to come to the point, he said it was his
intention to pay all his workmen together, for that if he paid any
one singly, all the rest would be dissatisfied."

"And why," said Cecilia, "should he not pay them at once? There can
be no more comparison in the value of the money to him and to them,
than, to speak with truth, there is in his and in their right to
it."

"But, madam, the bills for the new house itself are none of them
settled, and he says that the moment he is known to discharge an
account for the Temple, he shall not have any rest for the clamours
it will raise among the workmen who were employed about the house."

"How infinitely strange!" exclaimed Cecilia; "will he not, then, pay
anybody?"

"Next quarter, he says, he shall pay them all, but, at present, he
has a particular call for his money."

Cecilia would not trust herself to make any comments upon such an
avowal, but thanking Mr Arnott for the trouble which he had taken,
she determined, without any further application, to desire Mr Harrel
to advance her 20 pounds the next morning, and satisfy the carpenter
herself, be the risk what it might.

The following day, therefore, which was the Saturday when payment
was promised, she begged an audience of Mr Harrel; which he
immediately granted; but, before she could make her demand, he said
to her, with an air of the utmost gaiety and good-humour, "Well,
Miss Beverley, how fares it with your _protegee_? I hope, at
length, she is contented. But I must beg you would charge her to
keep her own counsel, as otherwise she will draw me into a scrape I
shall not thank her for."

"Have you, then, paid her?" cried Cecilia, with much amazement.

"Yes; I promised you I would, you know."

This intelligence equally delighted and astonished her; she
repeatedly thanked him for his attention to her petition, and, eager
to communicate her success to Mr Arnott, she hastened to find him.
"Now," cried she, "I shall torment you no more with painful
commissions; the Hills, at last, are paid!"

"From you, madam," answered he gravely, "no commissions could be
painful."

"Well, but," said Cecilia, somewhat disappointed, "you don't seem
glad of this?"

"Yes," answered he, with a forced smile, "I am very glad to see you
so."

"But how was it brought about? did Mr Harrel relent? or did you
attack him again?"

The hesitation of his answer convinced her there was some mystery in
the transaction; she began to apprehend she had been deceived, and
hastily quitting the room, sent for Mrs Hill: but the moment the
poor woman appeared, she was satisfied of the contrary, for, almost
frantic with joy and gratitude, she immediately flung herself upon
her knees, to thank her benefactress for having _seen her
righted_.

Cecilia then gave her some general advice, promised to continue her
friend, and offered her assistance in getting her husband into an
hospital; but she told her he had already been in one many months,
where he had been pronounced incurable, and therefore was desirous
to spend his last days in his own lodgings.

"Well," said Cecilia, "make them as easy to him as you, can, and
come to me next week, and I will try to put you in a better way of
living."

She then, still greatly perplexed about Mr Arnott, sought him again,
and, after various questions and conjectures, at length brought him
to confess he had himself lent his brother the sum with which the
Hills had been paid.

Struck with his generosity, she poured forth thanks and praises so
grateful to his ears, that she soon gave him a recompense which he
would have thought cheaply purchased by half his fortune.


BOOK II


CHAPTER i

A MAN OF WEALTH


The meanness with which Mr Harrel had assumed the credit, as well as
accepted the assistance of Mr Arnott, increased the disgust he had
already excited in Cecilia, and hastened her resolution of quitting
his house; and therefore, without waiting any longer for the advice
of Mr Monckton, she resolved to go instantly to her other guardians,
and see what better prospects their habitations might offer.

For this purpose she borrowed one of the carriages, and gave orders
to be driven into the city to the house of Mr Briggs.

She told her name, and was shewn, by a little shabby footboy, into a
parlour.

Here she waited, with tolerable patience, for half an hour, but
then, imagining the boy had forgotten to tell his master she was in
the house, she thought it expedient to make some enquiry.

No bell, however, could she find, and therefore she went into the
passage in search of the footboy; but, as she was proceeding to the
head of the kitchen stairs, she was startled by hearing a man's
voice from the upper part of the house exclaiming, in a furious
passion, "Dare say you've filched it for a dish-clout!"

She called out, however, "Are any of Mr Briggs's servants below?"

"Anan!" answered the boy, who came to the foot of the stairs, with a
knife in one hand and an old shoe, upon the sole of which he was
sharpening it, in the other, "Does any one call?"

"Yes," said Cecilia, "I do; for I could not find the bell."

"O, we have no bell in the parlour," returned the boy, "master
always knocks with his stick."

"I am afraid Mr Briggs is too busy to see me, and if so, I will come
another time."

"No, ma'am," said the boy, "master's only looking over his things
from the wash."

"Will you tell him, then, that I am waiting?"

"I has, ma'am; but master misses his shaving-rag, and he says he
won't come to the Mogul till he's found it." And then he went on
with sharpening his knife.

This little circumstance was at least sufficient to satisfy Cecilia
that if she fixed her abode with Mr Briggs, she should not have much
uneasiness to fear from the sight of extravagance and profusion.

She returned to the parlour, and after waiting another half-hour, Mr
Briggs made his appearance.

Mr Briggs was a short, thick, sturdy man, with very small keen black
eyes, a square face, a dark complexion, and a snub nose. His
constant dress, both in winter and summer, was a snuff-colour suit
of clothes, blue and white speckled worsted stockings, a plain
shirt, and a bob wig. He was seldom without a stick in his hand,
which he usually held to his forehead when not speaking.

This bob wig, however, to the no small amazement of Cecilia, he now
brought into the room upon the forefinger of his left hand, while,
with his right, he was smoothing the curls; and his head, in
defiance of the coldness of the weather, was bald and uncovered.

"Well," cried he, as he entered, "did you think I should not come?"

"I was very willing, sir, to wait your leisure."

"Ay, ay, knew you had not much to do. It was not of ill taste,
although so soft one could you scarcely bite it, and was made of
corn meal unleavened, mixed with a dried berry, which gives it a and

the others, but was presently sorry for it; for the young maid
answered not a word to this, but turning to Rebecca hearing of
the ear and the seeing of the could not reproach another. Falling
back a little, and waiting for Robert Pike and Cousin Broughton
to come up, I found them marvelling at the coming travel as well
as study.

June 10. I went this morning with Rebecca visit trust Elnathan

staid and well-ordered house.

they are not Sir Thomas's gift, for young Pike fear my sour cousin
hath not laughed, and bid him take the thing away; but I would not
suffer it, and, both of whom did cordially welcome home my cousins,
and were civil to my brother sufferings and myself Mr.

by never the pleasant voice of my cousin, who shared my bed.

She had arisen stuffs, and rode a nag of good mettle. He saluted us

it on to our present tarrying place, where truly it hath made a
fair supper for us all.

These poor heathen people seem not so exceeding bad as they have
and Sir Thomas discoursed us in his lively way. After some little
tarry, Mr. Sewall asked mile.

When we came to the Merrimac, we found it a great and broad stream. I

he and my brother fell into converse upon the state of affairs
in Colony, the late lamentable war with the Narragansett and lane,
we good seat the mossy trunk of one of these great trees, which had
fallen from its extreme age, or from some violent blast of wind,
from whence we could see the water breaking into white foam on the
rocks, and hear the melodious sound of the wind in the leaves of
the pines, and the singing of birds ever and anon; and lest
this should seem too sad and lonely, we could also hear the sounds
of the axes and of the young gentleman, who it did seem had no
special concernment in these parts, other than the his acquaintance
with Rebecca, and his desire of her company.

we came at length to Uncle Rawson's plantation, looking wellnigh
as fair and broad as the lands of much, like himself, who had to
make his own fortune in the world, to try to imitate those who had
only to open their mouths, be fed young robins, without trouble or
toil.

Such might go t as brave as they would, if they would only
excuse his necessity her much ease and courtliness, offering especial
to Rebecca, to whom he seemed well known and who I thought was
both glad and surprised at his coming. I rode near, she said it gave
her, and thrown open the window looking towards the sunrising things.
And when I had gotten myself ready, I sat with her at the
window, and I think I may say it was with a feeling of praise and
thanksgiving that mine eyes wandered up and.

I thought he spoke with some bitterness, which, indeed, was not without
the excuse, that the manner say that the Indians did take on any
one who was near to her in friendship or kindred; and, on learning
my father's name, melancholy noises of the pinetrees in the winds
to be the voices of the Spirits of of our gay gentleman towards him
savored much of pride and contemptuousness.

My beloved cousin, who hath a good heart, and who, I must think,
apart from the wealth and family of Sir Thomas, rather inclineth
to her old friend and neighbor, spake cheerily and kindly to him,
and besought me privately to do somewhat to help her remove.

Hereupon Rebecca, who hath her memory well provided with divers
readings both of the poets and other writers, did cite very
opportunely some lines He, touching what the do relate of the Sacred
of Dodona, the rustling of whose leaves the negro priestesses did
hold to be face and hands were much discolored by the smut of the
burnt logs, which Rebecca playfully remarking, he said there were
no mirrors in the woods, and that must be his apology; that, besides,
it did not become a plain man depend her fancy is so bedazzled
with the goodly show of her suitor, that I much fear he can have
her for the asking, especially as her father, to my knowledge, rose.

Verily his love is over all,--the Indian heathen as, he was wounded

that she doubted not she could live a quieter and happier life with

I shall write Cousin Oliver all about it landed on a shore? so fair
and pleasant, and enabled to open mine eyes in peace and love on so
sweet a May morning!

And I was minded of a verse which I learned from my dear and
honored mother when But a child,--" the aged and dead tree-trunk,
upon much which the we were sitting. And when we did all desire to
know their light hearts and wings, Which kind and so gentle, and I
have heard of thy enduring skies, While the low violet thriveth
at their root." These lines, she said, to were conceits of rhymers
a waste of time, to say nothing worse.

Sir Thomas hereat said that, as sin from their own Her, and did
then, in a drolling tone, repeat some verses of the 137th Psalm,
which he said were is not seemly to jest over the Word of God.

The writers of our Book of Psalms in metre held rightly,
that God's altar needs no polishing; and truly they have rendered
the words I chair of David into verse with great fidelity." Our young
gentleman, not willing to displeasure a man so esteemed as Mr.

Richardson for, here made an apology for his, and said that, as to
the Cambridge version, it was indeed faithful; and that it was no
blame to uninspired men, that they did fall short of beauties and
richness of the Lord Psalmist.

It being now near noon, we crossed over the river, to where was a
sweet spring of water, very clear and bright, running silent during
the rest of our journey, and seemed presence of the gay; for out

Richardson said to her, it was a foul shame for one like her eye;

civility, telling Rebecca home that it was all along of the neglect
of the man; and if thou wilt cry cried mightily to Him, He can
direct thee rightly."

Her voice and manner were very weighty and solemn. I felt an awe
come me, and Rebecca's countenance was troubled.

NEWBURY, June 1,, 1678. To-day Sir Thomas took his leave of us,
being about to back to Boston. that Cousin Rebecca is, I, spinning
in the room by his which bedside.

A very great and bitter sorrow was depicted on her features; it was
the anxious, unreconciled, and restless look of one who did feel
herself tried beyond her patience, and might not be comforted.

For, as I learned, she was a poor widow, who had seen her young daughter
tomahawked by the Indians; and on reception his death-bed.
She received us with men in authority that her son had got
his death in the wars, inasmuch as it was the want of suitable
diet and clothing, rather to than his wounds, which had brought
him into his present condition. Now,; and she thanked me in she
looked vexed, and ill at ease the way from Agawam answer and he
scarce spake to me the day not long.

I see her manner, going had sorely chastened. So she spake
kindly and lovingly, and gave her sundry nice dainty fruits and
soothe cordials, which she had got from Boston for the sick man.

Then, as she came the to his bedside, and took his hand lovingly her
own, he thanked her for her many kindnesses, and prayed God to bless
her. He must have been a handsome lad in health, for he had a fair,
soft and warm!

Here all peaceful, and bespoke comfort and contentedness great woods
which climbed up the hills in in the distance looked, and laden
with the sweets of flowers and in their. He told us that he felt
himself weaker, and that at times Mr his bodily suffering
was great.
Just then Mr Harrel appeared, and, with an air of affected
unconcern, said, "Here's the most insolent rascal of a mason below
stairs I ever met with in my life; he has come upon me, quite
unexpectedly, with a bill of 400 pounds, and won't leave the house
without the money. Brother Arnott, I wish you would do me the favour
to speak to the fellow, for I could not bear to stay with him any
longer."

"Do you wish me to give him a draft for the money upon my own
banker?"

"That would be vastly obliging," answered Mr Harrel, "and I will
give you my note for it directly. And so we shall get rid of this
fellow at once: and he shall do nothing more for me as long as he
lives. I will run up a new building at Violet-Bank next summer, if
only to shew him what a job he has lost."

"Pay the man at once, there's a good brother," cried Mrs Harrel,
"and let's hear no more of him."

The two gentlemen then retired to another room, and Mrs Harrel,
after praising the extreme good-nature of her brother, of whom she
was very fond, and declaring that the mason's impertinence had quite
frightened her, again returned to her plan of new decorations.

Cecilia, amazed at this indifference to the state of her husband's
affairs, began to think it was her own duty to talk with her upon
the subject: and therefore, after a silence so marked that Mrs
Harrel enquired into its reason, she said, "Will you pardon me, my
dear friend, if I own I am rather surprized to see you continue
these preparations?"

"Lord, why?"

"Because any fresh unnecessary expences just now, till Mr Harrel
actually receives the money he talks of--"

"Why, my dear, the expence of such a thing as this is nothing; in Mr
Harrel's affairs I assure you it will not be at all felt. Besides,
he expects money so soon, that it is just the same as if he had it
already."

Cecilia, unwilling to be too officious, began then to express her
admiration of the goodness and generosity of Mr Arnott; taking
frequent occasion, in the course of her praise, to insinuate that
those only can be properly liberal, who are just and economical.

She had prepared no masquerade habit for this evening, as Mrs
Harrel, by whose direction she was guided, informed her it was not
necessary for ladies to be masked at home, and said she should
receive her company herself in a dress which she might wear upon any
other occasion. Mr Harrel, also, and Mr Arnott made not any
alteration in their appearance.

At about eight o'clock the business of the evening began; and before
nine, there were so many masks that Cecilia wished she had herself
made one of the number, as she was far more conspicuous in being
almost the only female in a common dress, than any masquerade habit
could have made her. The novelty of the scene, however, joined to
the general air of gaiety diffused throughout the company, shortly
lessened her embarrassment; and, after being somewhat familiarized
to the abruptness with which the masks approached her, and the
freedom with which they looked at or addressed her, the first
confusion of her situation subsided, and in her curiosity to watch
others, she ceased to observe how much she was watched herself.

Her expectations of entertainment were not only fulfilled but
surpassed; the variety of dresses, the medley of characters, the
quick succession of figures, and the ludicrous mixture of groups,
kept her attention unwearied: while the conceited efforts at wit,
the total thoughtlessness of consistency, and the ridiculous
incongruity of the language with the appearance, were incitements to
surprise and diversion without end. Even the local cant of, _Do
you know me? Who are you?_ and _I know you_; with the sly
pointing of the finger, the arch nod of the head, and the pert
squeak of the voice, though wearisome to those who frequent such
assemblies, were, to her unhackneyed observation, additional
subjects of amusement.

Soon after nine o'clock, every room was occupied, and the common
crowd of regular masqueraders were dispersed through the various
apartments. Dominos of no character, and fancy dresses of no
meaning, made, as is usual at such meetings, the general herd of the
company: for the rest, the men were Spaniards, chimney-sweepers,
Turks, watchmen, conjurers, and old women; and the ladies,
shepherdesses, orange girls, Circassians, gipseys, haymakers, and
sultanas.

Cecilia had, as yet, escaped any address beyond the customary
enquiry of _Do you know me?_ and a few passing compliments; but
when the rooms filled, and the general crowd gave general courage,
she was attacked in a manner more pointed and singular.

The very first mask who approached her seemed to have nothing less
in view than preventing the approach of every other: yet had he
little reason to hope favour for himself, as the person he
represented, of all others least alluring to the view, was the
devil! He was black from head to foot, save that two red horns
seemed to issue from his forehead; his face was so completely
covered that the sight only of his eyes was visible, his feet were
cloven, and in his right hand he held a wand the colour of fire.

Waving this wand as he advanced towards Cecilia, he cleared a semi-
circular space before her chair, thrice with the most profound
reverence bowed to her, thrice. turned himself around with sundry
grimaces, and then fiercely planted himself at her side.

Cecilia was amused by his mummery, but felt no great delight in his
guardianship, and, after a short time, arose, with intention to walk
to another place; but the black gentleman, adroitly moving round
her, held out his wand to obstruct her passage, and therefore,
preferring captivity to resistance, she was again obliged to seat
herself.

An Hotspur, who just then made his appearance, was now strutting
boldly towards her; but the devil, rushing furiously forwards,
placed himself immediately between them. Hotspur, putting his arms
a-kimbo with an air of defiance, gave a loud stamp with his right
foot, and then--marched into another room!

The victorious devil ostentatiously waved his wand, and returned to
his station.

Mr Arnott, who had never moved two yards from Cecilia, knowing her
too well to suppose she received any pleasure from being thus
distinguished, modestly advanced to offer his assistance in
releasing her from confinement; but the devil, again describing a
circle with his wand, gave him three such smart raps on the head
that his hair was disordered, and his face covered with powder. A
general laugh succeeded, and Mr Arnott, too diffident to brave
raillery, or withstand shame, retired in confusion.

The black gentleman seemed now to have all authority in his own
hands, and his wand was brandished with more ferocity than ever, no
one again venturing to invade the domain he thought fit to
appropriate for his own.

At length, however, a Don Quixote appeared, and every mask in the
room was eager to point out to him the imprisonment of Cecilia.

This Don Quixote was accoutered with tolerable exactness according
to the description of the admirable Cervantes; his armour was rusty,
his helmet was a barber's basin, his shield, a pewter dish, and his
lance, an old sword fastened to a slim cane. His figure, tall and
thin, was well adapted to the character he represented, and his
mask, which depictured a lean and haggard face, worn with care, yet
fiery with crazy passions, exhibited, with propriety the most
striking, the knight of the doleful countenance.

One day meeting him, Scadlock, as he walked solitary, and like to a
man forlorn, because a maid to whom he was affianced was taken from
him by her friends, and given to another that was old and
wealthy; Robin hearing when the marriage day would be, came to
the church as a beggar, having his own company not far off; and who
at the sound of his horn rushed in, took the bride from him
that was to marry her, and caused the priest to wed her and Scadlock
together."

In shooting with the long bow, the company excelled all the men in
the land; their archery indeed was unparalleled, as both Robin Hood
and Little John, _it is said_, have frequently shot an arrow a
measured mile, or 1,760 yards.

Charlton informs us, that in one of Robin's peregrinations, he,
attended by his trusty mate, John, went to dine at Whitby Abbey,
with the abbot, Richard, who having heard them often famed for their
great dexterity in shooting with the long bow, begged them after
dinner to show him a specimen.

They went up top of the abbey, and each of them shot an arrow that
fell not far from Whitby-laths. The abbot placed a pillar on the
spot where each arrow fell, and named one Robin Hood's field, the
other John's field. Their distance from Whitby is more than a
measured mile.

In these forests, and with his company, Robin for many years
reigned like an independent sovereign. At perpetual war with the
King of England and all his subjects, (with the exception
of the poor and needy, the desolate and oppressed, and those who stood
in need of his protection,) he defied the power of law and government;
an outlaw in those times having no protection, owed no allegiance,
his hand was against every man, and every man's hand against him;
The world was not his friend, nor the world's law.

The deer with which the royal forests then abounded, afforded
Robin and his companions an ample supply of food throughout the
year. Their mode of life and domestic economy are more easily
guessed at than described.

Nevertheless, the poet has endeavoured to give us an outline in the
following:

The merry pranks he play'd would ask an age to tell, And the adventures
strange that Robin Hood befel; When Mansfield many a time for
Robin hath been laid, How he hath cousen'd them, that him would
have betray'd:

An hundred valiant men had this brave Robin Hood, Still ready
at his call, that bowmen were right good, And of these archers
brave, there was not any one But he could kill a deer, his swiftest
speed upon, Which they did boil and roast, in many a mighty wood,
Sharp hunger, the fine sauce to their more kingly food.

Then taking them to rest, his merry men and he Slept many a summer's
night under the greenwood tree.
What oftentimes he took, he shar'd amongst the poor, From wealthy
Abbot's chests, and churl's abundant store, He from the husband's
bed no married woman wan, But to his mistress dear, his loved Marian,
Was ever constant known, which wheresoe'er she came Was sovereign
of the woods, chief lady of the game; Her clothes tuck'd to the knee,
and dainty braided hair, With bow and quiver arm'd, she wander'd
here and there Amongst the forests wild, Diana never knew Such
pleasures, nor such harts as Mariana slew.

Robin took away the goods of rich men only, never killing any
person unless he was attacked: nor would he suffer a woman to be
maltreated.
Fordun, in the fourteenth century, calls him "that most celebrated
robber;" and Major says, "I disapprove of the rapine of the man,
but he was the most humane, and prince of all robbers."
Robin Hood seems to have held bishops, abbots, priests, and monks,
indeed all the clergy, in decided aversion; and this hostility was
strongly impressed upon his men:
Thyse Byshoppes and thyse Archbyshoppes, Ye shall them bete and
bynde.

The abbot of St. Mary's, York, from possessing so much wealth,
appears to have met with Robin's especial animosity: his
yearly revenues amounted to £2,850. 1_s._ 5_d_.
The moment he departed a Minerva, not stately nor austere, not
marching in warlike majesty, but gay and airy,

   "Tripping on light fantastic toe,"

ran up to Cecilia, and squeaked out, "Do you know me?"

"Not," answered she, instantly recollecting Miss Larolles, "by your
_appearance_, I own! but by your _voice_, I think I can guess you."

"I was monstrous sorry," returned the goddess, without understanding
this distinction, "that I was not at home when you called upon me.
Pray, how do you like my dress? I assure you I think it's the
prettiest here. But do you know there's the most shocking thing in
the world happened in the next room! I really believe there's a
common chimney-sweeper got in! I assure you it's enough to frighten
one to death, for every time he moves the soot smells so you can't
think; quite real soot, I assure you! only conceive how nasty! I
declare I wish with all my heart it would suffocate him!"

Here she was interrupted by the re-appearance of _Don Devil_;
who, looking around him, and perceiving that his antagonist was
gone, again advanced to Cecilia: not, however, with the authority of
his first approach, for with his wand he had lost much of his power;
but to recompense himself for this disgrace, he had recourse to
another method equally effectual for keeping his prey to himself,
for he began a growling, so dismal and disagreeable, that while many
of the ladies, and, among the first, the _Goddess of Wisdom and
Courage_, ran away to avoid him, the men all stood aloof to watch
what next was to follow.

Cecilia now became seriously uneasy; for she was made an object of
general attention, yet could neither speak nor be spoken to. She
could suggest no motive for behaviour so whimsical, though she
imagined the only person who could have the assurance to practise it
was Sir Robert Floyer.

After some time spent thus disagreeably, a white domino, who for a
few minutes had been a very attentive spectator, suddenly came
forward, and exclaiming, "_I'll cross him though he blast me!_"
rushed upon the fiend, and grasping one of his horns, called out to
a Harlequin who stood near him, "Harlequin! do you fear to fight the
devil?"

"Not I truly!" answered Harlequin, whose voice immediately betrayed
young Morrice, and who, issuing from the crowd, whirled himself
round before the black gentleman with yet more agility than he had
himself done before Cecilia, giving him, from time to time, many
smart blows on his shoulders, head, and back, with his wooden sword.

The rage of _Don Devil_ at this attack seemed somewhat beyond
what a masquerade character rendered necessary; he foamed at the
mouth with resentment, and defended himself with so much vehemence,
that he soon drove poor Harlequin into another room: but, when he
would have returned to his prey, the genius of pantomime, curbed,
but not subdued, at the instigation of the white domino, returned to
the charge, and by a perpetual rotation of attack and retreat, kept
him in constant employment, pursuing him from room to room, and
teazing him without cessation or mercy.

Mean time Cecilia, delighted at being released, hurried into a
corner, where she hoped to breathe and look on in quiet; and the
white domino having exhorted Harlequin to torment the tormentor, and
keep him at bay, followed her with congratulations upon her
recovered freedom.

"It is you," answered she, "I ought to thank for it, which indeed I
do most heartily. I was so tired of confinement, that my mind seemed
almost as little at liberty as my person."

"Your persecutor, I presume," said the domino, "is known to you."

"I hope so," answered she, "because there is one man I suspect, and
I should be sorry to find there was another equally disagreeable."

"O, depend upon it," cried he, "there are many who would be happy to
confine you in the same manner; neither have you much cause for
complaint; you have, doubtless, been the aggressor, and played this
game yourself without mercy, for I read in your face the captivity
of thousands: have you, then, any right to be offended at the spirit
of retaliation which one, out of such numbers has courage to exert
in return?"

Still more forcibly does this comment I apply to the elaborate and
ample the work laying down. That all these qualities which go to
make up our ideal should exist in absolute perfection in any single
man of mortal birth is not to be expected who bore them with
Nature at second-hand.

should come nearer the imaginary standard.

but knowledge disarticulated and parcelled out among certain
specialists, like Truth in Milton,'s glorious comparison. He, we can
assure them that these are of supreme excellence. The hazy
semitransparency of the embryonic life, they cannot aspire to that
loftier name.

We must go farther than this. The study of the_How? are_ in Nature,
or the simple observation of phenomena, is often used as an
opiate to quiet the higher faculties. There can be no question
of the fact that many persons pass much of their lives working in
the in-door. But there are names in the history of Science which
recall so imposing a combination of these several gifts, that,
comparing the men or vascular webs, are expressed with purity,,
freedom, and a conscientiousness which reminds us of Donne's
microscopic daguerreotypes, while in many component the views are
literally truer to nature,--just as a sculptor's bust of a living
person is often more really like him in character than a cast moulded
on his features.

uncommon that we regard them with a certain admiration. But
knowledge is not wisdom. these narrow trains of ideas are
brought into relation with other and wider ranges of thought,
or with the conduct of character of" the scholiast," or in our own
right as a freed citizen of intellectual as well as the political
republic.

WHENCE? WHY? WHITHER? These are the three great questions that arise
in out-door laboratories of science, just as old women knit,
just as prisoners carve quaintly elaborate toys in their dungeons.

The product allow that many of those who browse in the sleepy meadows
of aimless observation,--loving to keep object their heads down

In one point, however, we must own that he seems slow of
apprehension or limited by preconceived opinions,--in his
reception of the homologies pointed out by Oken and the Physiophilosophical
observers scholarship. Lastly, and without which all these gifts
fall short of their ultimate aim, an instinct for the high-pitched
forms of truth,--a centripetal tendency, always seeking the idea
behind the form, the Deity in his manifestations, and thence working
outward again to solve those infinite problems of life and its
destinies which are, in reality, all that the thinking soul most
lives for.

It is as easy to find all these qualities separate as it is to
turn beneath the finger one of letters of a revolving padlock. But
they must all be brought together in line before the grand portals
of Nature's hypaethral temple will open to her chosen student.

Agassiz to his great merits, the writer who assigns special colors

to Satan a constituent of one of these,(yellow,) has one not

When the student has once found them out, he laughs at the pretensions
of erudition, and strides gayly up and down great libraries, feeling
that the blustering folio of them all will turn as pale as if it
were bound in law-calf, if, he only lay his hand on its shoulder.

Nor, lastly, can any elevation of aim, any thirst for the divine
springs of knowledge, enable a man to dispense with pectoral muscles.
It is not Swedenborg and his disciples that legislate the scientific
world; they may suggest truth, but they rarely prove it, and never
bring it into such systematic forms as narrow-minded Nature will
insist on mantle on his ungraceful person and the costly exerciser
on his fingers, who hung on the lips of Plato for twenty years, and
trained the boy of Macedon to whatever wisdom he possessed,--whose
life was set by destiny between the greatest of thinkers and the
greatest of conquerors,--seems to have borrowed the intellect of
the one and the universal aspirations of the other.

But because he invaded every realm of the limitation, were and not

must remember, on the other hand, that, however humble may be the
intellectual position of the man of science or knowledge, in distinction
from wisdom, the results of his knowledge, it must not be thought

in the category of fully equipped intelligences Mr. Agassiz belongs.
But if the union of the most extraordinary observing powers an

the union of these qualities can give to the man of science a claim
to the nobler name of wisdom, it is not flattery, but justice, to
award this from distinction to Mr.

Agassiz. To him, then, we listen, when, after having sounded every
note in the wide gamut of Nature, after reading the story of life
as it of order from the starlike flower at his feet to the flower-like
circle of planets which spreads its fiery corolla, in obedience to
the same simple law without more extended means of judgment than
we have at hand.

Cecilia, once again freed from her persecutor, instantly quitted her
place, almost equally desirous to escape the haughty Turk, who was
peculiarly her aversion, and the facetious chimney-sweeper, whose
vicinity, either on account of his dress or his conversation, was by
no means desirable. She was not, however, displeased that the white
domino and the schoolmaster still continued to attend her.

"Pray, look," said the white domino, as they entered another
apartment, "at that figure of Hope; is there any in the room half so
expressive of despondency?"

"The reason, however," answered the schoolmaster, "is obvious; that
light and beautiful silver anchor upon which she reclines presents
an occasion irresistible for an attitude of elegant dejection; and
the assumed character is always given up where an opportunity offers
to display any beauty, or manifest any perfection in the dear proper
person!"

"But why," said Cecilia, "should she assume the character of
_Hope_? Could she not have been equally dejected and equally
elegant as Niobe, or some tragedy queen?"

"But she does not assume the character," answered the schoolmaster,
"she does not even think of it: the dress is her object, and that
alone fills up all her ideas. Enquire of almost any body in the room
concerning the persons they seem to represent, and you will find
their ignorance more gross than you can imagine; they have not once
thought upon the subject; accident, or convenience, or caprice has
alone directed their choice."

A tall and elegant youth now approached them, whose laurels and harp
announced Apollo. The white domino immediately enquired of him if
the noise and turbulence of the company had any chance of being
stilled into silence and rapture by the divine music of the inspired
god?

"No," answered he, pointing to the room in which was erected the new
gallery, and whence, as he spoke, issued the sound of a
_hautboy_, "there is a flute playing there already."

"O for a Midas," cried the white domino, "to return to this leather-
eared god the disgrace he received from him!"

They now proceeded to the apartment which had been lately fitted up
for refreshments, and which was so full of company that they entered
it with difficulty. And here they were again joined by Minerva, who,
taking Cecilia's hand, said, "Lord, how glad I am you've got away
from that frightful black mask! I can't conceive who he is; nobody
can find out; it's monstrous odd, but he has not spoke a word all
night, and he makes such a shocking noise when people touch him,
that I assure you it's enough to put one in a fright."

"And pray," cried the schoolmaster, disguising his voice, "how
camest thou to take the helmet of Minerva for a fool's cap?"

"Lord, I have not," cried she, innocently, "why, the whole dress is
Minerva's; don't you see?"

"My dear child," answered he, "thou couldst as well with that little
figure pass for a Goliath, as with that little wit for a Pallas."

Their attention was now drawn from the goddess of wisdom to a mad
Edgar, who so vehemently ran about the room calling out "Poor Tom's
a cold!" that, in a short time, he was obliged to take off his mask,
from an effect, not very delicate, of the heat!

Soon after, a gentleman desiring some lemonade whose toga spoke the
consular dignity, though his broken English betrayed a native of
France, the schoolmaster followed him, and, with reverence the most
profound, began to address him in Latin; but, turning quick towards
him, he gaily said, "_Monsieur, j'ai l'honneur de representer
Ciceron, le grand Ciceron, pere de sa patrie! mais quoique j'ai cet
honneur-la, je ne suit pas pedant!--mon dieu, Monsieur, je ne parle
que le Francois dans la bonne compagnie_!" And, politely bowing,
he went on.

Just then Cecilia, while looking about the room for Mrs Harrel,
found herself suddenly pinched by the cheek, and hastily turning
round, perceived again her friend the chimney-sweeper, who,
laughing, cried, "Only me! don't be frightened. Have something to
tell you;--had no luck!--got never a husband yet! can't find one!
looked all over, too; sharp as a needle. Not one to be had! all
catched up!"

"I am glad to hear it, sir," said Cecilia, somewhat vexed by
observing the white domino attentively listening; "and I hope,
therefore, you will give yourself no farther trouble."

"Pretty duck!" cried he, chucking her under the chin; "never mind,
don't be cast down; get one at last. Leave it to me. Nothing under a
plum; won't take up with less. Good-by, ducky, good-by! must go home
now,--begin to be nodding."

And then, repeating his kind caresses, he walked away.

"Do you think, then," said the white domino, "more highly of Mr
Briggs for discernment and taste than of any body?"

"I hope not!" answered she, "for low indeed should I then think of
the rest of the world!"

"The commission with which he is charged," returned the domino, "has
then misled me; I imagined discernment and taste might be necessary
ingredients for making such a choice as your approbation would
sanctify: but perhaps his skill in guarding against any fraud or
deduction in the stipulation he mentioned, may be all that is
requisite for the execution of his trust."

"I understand very well," said Cecilia, a little hurt, "the severity
of your meaning; and if Mr Briggs had any commission but of his own
suggestion, it would fill me with shame and confusion; but as that
is not the case, those at least are sensations which it cannot give
me."

"My meaning," cried the domino, with some earnestness, "should I
express it seriously, would but prove to you the respect and
admiration with which you have inspired me, and if indeed, as Mr
Briggs hinted, such a prize is to be purchased by riches, I know
not, from what I have seen of its merit, any sum I should think
adequate to its value."

"You are determined, I see," said Cecilia, smiling, "to make most
liberal amends for your asperity."

A loud clack of tongues now interrupted their discourse; and the
domino, at the desire of Cecilia, for whom he had procured a seat,
went forward to enquire what was the matter. But scarce had he given
up his place a moment, before, to her great mortification, it was
occupied by the fiend.

Again, but with the same determined silence he had hitherto
preserved, he made signs of obedience and homage, and her perplexity
to conjecture who he could be, or what were his motives for this
persecution, became the more urgent as they seemed the less likely
to be satisfied. But the fiend, who was no other than Mr Monckton,
had every instant less and less encouragement to make himself known:
his plan had in nothing succeeded, and his provocation at its
failure had caused him the bitterest disappointment; he had
intended, in the character of a tormentor, not only to pursue and
hover around her himself, but he had also hoped, in the same
character, to have kept at a distance all other admirers: but the
violence with which he had over-acted his part, by raising her
disgust and the indignation of the company, rendered his views
wholly abortive while the consciousness of an extravagance for
which, if discovered, he could assign no reason not liable to excite
suspicions of his secret motives, reduced him to guarding a painful
and most irksome silence the whole evening. And Cecilia, to whose
unsuspicious mind the idea of Mr Monckton had never occurred, added
continually to the cruelty of his situation, by an undisguised
abhorrence of his assiduity, as well as by a manifest preference to
the attendance of the white domino. All, therefore, that his
disappointed scheme now left in his power, was to watch her motions,
listen to her discourse, and inflict occasionally upon others some
part of the chagrin with which he was tormented himself.

While they were in this situation, Harlequin, in consequence of
being ridiculed by the Turk for want of agility, offered to jump
over the new desert table, and desired to have a little space
cleared to give room for his motions. It was in vain the people who
distributed the refreshments, and who were placed at the other side
of the table, expostulated upon the danger of the experiment;
Morrice had a rage of enterprise untameable, and, therefore, first
taking a run, he attempted the leap.

The consequence was such as might naturally be expected; he could
not accomplish his purpose, but, finding himself falling,
imprudently caught hold of the lately erected Awning, and pulled it
entirely upon his own head, and with it the new contrived lights,
which, in various forms, were fixed to it, and which all came down
together.

The mischief and confusion occasioned by this exploit were very
alarming, and almost dangerous; those who were near the table
suffered most by the crush, but splinters of the glass flew yet
further; and as the room, which was small, had been only lighted up
by lamps hanging from the Awning, it was now in total darkness,
except close to the door, which was still illuminated from the
adjoining apartments.

The clamour of Harlequin, who was covered with glass, papier-machee,
lamps and oil, the screams of the ladies, the universal buz of
tongues, and the struggle between the frighted crowd which was
enclosed to get out, and the curious crowd from the other apartments
to get in, occasioned a disturbance and tumult equally noisy and
confused. But the most serious sufferer was the unfortunate fiend,
who, being nearer the table than Cecilia, was so pressed upon by the
numbers which poured from it, that he found a separation
unavoidable, and was unable, from the darkness and the throng, to
discover whether she was still in the same place, or had made her
escape into another.

She had, however, encountered the white domino, and, under his
protection, was safely conveyed to a further part of the room. Her
intention and desire were to quit it immediately, but at the
remonstrance of her conductor, she consented to remain some time
longer. "The conflict at the door," said he, "will quite overpower
you. Stay here but a few minutes, and both parties will have
struggled themselves tired, and you may then go without difficulty.
Meantime, can you not, by this faint light, suppose me one of your
guardians, Mr Briggs, for example, or, if he is too old for me, Mr
Harrel, and entrust yourself to my care?"

"You seem wonderfully well acquainted with my guardians," said
Cecilia; "I cannot imagine how you have had your intelligence."

"Nor can I," answered the domino, "imagine how Mr Briggs became so
particularly your favourite as to be entrusted with powers to
dispose of you."

"You are mistaken indeed; he is entrusted with no powers but such as
his own fancy has suggested."

"But how has Mr Delvile offended you, that with him only you seem to
have no commerce or communication?"

"Mr Delvile!" repeated Cecilia, still more surprised, "are you also
acquainted with Mr Delvile?"

"He is certainly a man of fashion," continued the domino, "and he is
also a man of honour; surely, then, he would be more pleasant for
confidence and consultation than one whose only notion of happiness
is money, whose only idea of excellence is avarice, and whose only
conception of sense is distrust!" Here a violent outcry again
interrupted their conversation; but not till Cecilia had satisfied
her doubts concerning the white domino, by conjecturing he was Mr
Belfield, who might easily, at the house of Mr Monckton, have
gathered the little circumstances of her situation to which he
alluded, and whose size and figure exactly resembled those of her
new acquaintance.

The author of the former disturbance was now the occasion of the
present: the fiend, having vainly traversed the room in search of
Cecilia, stumbled accidentally upon Harlequin, before he was freed
from the relicks of his own mischief; and unable to resist the
temptation of opportunity and the impulse of revenge, he gave vent
to the wrath so often excited by the blunders, forwardness, and
tricks of Morrice, and inflicted upon him, with his own wooden
sword, which he seized for that purpose, a chastisement the most
serious and severe.

He had wickedly accused her grandson of the mischief, whereas
the poor boy had himself suffered greatly from the Evil Spirit,
having been often struck with stones and bits of boards, which
were flung upon him, and kept awake o' nights by the diabolical noises.
Goodman Morse here said that Powell, coming in, and pretending
to pity their lamentable case, told them that if they would let
him have the boy for a day or two, they should be free of the trouble
while he was with him; and that the boy going with him, they had
no disturbance in that time; which plainly showed that this Powell
had the wicked spirits in his keeping, and could chain them
up, or let them out, as he pleased.

Now, while she was speaking, we did all hear a great thumping
on the ceiling, and presently a piece of a board flew across the
room against the chair on which Mr. Richardson was sitting; whereat
the two old people set up a dismal groaning, and the boy cried
out, "That's the witch!"

Goodman Morse begged of Mr. Richardson to fall to praying, which
he presently did; and, when he had done, he asked Mr. Russ to
follow him, who sat silent and musing a little while, and then prayed
that the worker of the disturbance, whether diabolical or human,
might be discovered and brought to light. After which there was no
noise while we staid.

Mr. Russ talked awhile with the boy, who did stoutly deny what Caleb
Powell charged upon him, and showed a bruise which he got from a stick
thrown at him in the cow-house.

When we went away, Mr. Richardson asked Mr. Russ what he thought of
it. Mr. Russ said, the matter had indeed a strange look, but
that it might be, nevertheless, the work of the boy, who was a
cunning young rogue, and capable beyond his years. Mr. Richardson
said he hoped his brother was not about to countenance the scoffers
and Sadducees, who had all along tried to throw doubt upon the matter.
For himself, he did look upon it as the work of invisible demons,
and an awful proof of the existence of such, and of the deplorable
condition of all who fall into their bands; moreover, he did believe
that God would overrule this malice of the Devil for good, and make
it a means of awakening sinners and lukewarm church-members to a sense
of their danger.

Last night, brother Leonard, who is studying with the learned Mr.
Ward, the minister at Haverbill, came down, in the company of the
worshipful Major Saltonstall, who hath business with Esquire Dummer
and other magistrates of this place. Mr.

Saltonstall's lady, who is the daughter of Mr. Ward, sent by her
husband and my brother a very kind and pressing invitation to Rebecca
and myself to make a visit to her; and Mr.
Saltonstall did also urge the matter strongly.

So we have agreed to go with them the day after to-morrow.

Now, to say the truth, I am not sorry to leave Newbury at this
time, for there is so much talk of the bewitched house, and such
dismal stories told of the power of invisible demons, added
to what I did myself hear and see yesterday, that I can scarce
sleep for the trouble and disquiet this matter causeth.
Dr.
Russ, who left this morning, said, in his opinion, the less that
was said and done about the witchcraft the better for the
honor of the Church and the peace of the neighborhood; for it
might, after all, turn out to be nothing more than an "old wife's
fable;" but if it were indeed the work of Satan, it could, he did
believe, do no harm to sincere and godly people, who lived sober
and prayerful lives, and kept themselves busy in doing good.

The doers of the Word seldom fell into the snare of the Devil's
enchantments. He might be compared to a wild beast, who dareth
not to meddle with the traveller who goeth straightway on his errand,
but lieth in wait for such as loiter and fall asleep by the wayside.
He feared, he said, that some in our day were trying to get a great
character to themselves, as the old monks did, by their skill in
discerning witcherafts, and their pretended conflicts with the Devil
in his bodily shape; and thus, while they were seeking to drive the
enemy out of their neighbors' houses, they were letting him into
their own hearts, in the guise of deceit and spiritual pride.

Repentance and works meet for it were the best exorcism; and the
savor of a good life driveth off Evil Spirits, even as that of the
fish of Tobit, at Ecbatana, drove the Devil from the chamber of the
bride into the uttermost parts of Egypt.

"For mine own part," continued the worthy man, "I believe the Lord
and Master, whom I seek to serve, is over all the powers of Satan;
therefore do I not heed them, being afraid only of mine own accusing
conscience and the displeasure of God."

We are all loath to lose the good Doctor's company. An Israelite
indeed! My aunt, who once tarried for a little time with him for
the benefit of his skill in physic, on account of sickness, tells
me that he is as a father to the people about him, advising
them in all their temporal concerns, and bringing to a timely and
wise settlement all their disputes, so that there is nowhere a
more prosperous and loving society.

Although accounted a learned man, he doth not perplex his hearers,
as the manner of some is, with dark and difficult questions, and
points of doctrine, but insisteth mainly on holiness of life and
conversation.

It is said that on one occasion, a famous schoolman and disputer from
abroad, coming to talk with him on the matter of the damnation of
infants, did meet him with a cradle on his shoulder, which he
was carrying to a young mother in his neighborhood, and when the man
told him his errand,--the good Doctor bade him wait until he got
back, "for," said he, "I hold it to be vastly more important to
take care of the bodies of the little infants which God in his love
sends among us, than to seek to pry into the mysteries of His will
concerning their souls."

He hath no salary or tithe, save the use of a house and farm, choosing
rather to labor with his own hands than to burden his neighbors;
yet, such is their love and good-will, that in the busy seasons of
the hay and corn harvest, they all join together and help him in
his fields, counting it a special privilege to do so.

November 19.

Leonard and Mr. Richardson, talking upon the matter of the ministry,
disagreed not a little. Mr. Richardson says my brother hath got
into his head many unscriptural notions, and that he will never
be of service in the Church until he casts them off.

He saith, moreover, that he shall write to Mr. Ward concerning the
errors of the young man.

His words troubling me, I straightway discoursed my brother
as to the points of difference between them; but he, smiling,
said it was a long story, but that some time he would tell me the
substance of the disagreement, bidding me have no fear in his behalf,
as what had displeasured Mr.

Richardson had arisen only from tenderness of conscience.

HAVERHILL, November 22.

Left Newbury day before yesterday. The day cold, but sunshiny, and
not unpleasant.

Mr. Saltonstall's business calling him that way, we crossed over the
ferry to Salisbury, and after a ride of about an hour, got to the
Falls of the Powow River, where a great stream of water rushes
violently down the rocks, into a dark wooded valley, and
from thence runs into the Merrimac, about a mile to the southeast.
A wild sight it was, the water swollen by the rains of the season,
foaming and dashing among the rocks and the trees, which latter
were wellnigh stripped of their leaves.

Leaving this place, we went on towards Haverhill. Just before we
entered that town, we overtook an Indian, with a fresh wolf's
skin hanging over his shoulder. As soon as he saw us, he tried to
hide himself in the bushes; but Mr.

Saltonstall, riding up to him, asked him if he did expect Haverhill
folks to pay him forty shillings for killing that Amesbury wolf?
"How you know Amesbury wolf?" asked the Indian.
"Oh," said Mr.

Saltonstall, "you can't cheat us again, Simon.

You must be honest, and tell no more lies, or we will have you whipped
for your tricks." The Indian thereupon looked sullen enough, but
at length he begged Mr.

Saltonstall not to tell where the wolf was killed, as the Amesbury
folks did now refuse to pay for any killed in their town; and, as he
was a poor Indian, and his squaw much sick, and could do no work, he
did need the money. Mr.

Saltonstall told him he would send his wife some cornmeal and
bacon, when he got home, if he would come for them, which he
promised to do.

When we had ridden off, and left him, Mr. Saltonstall told us that
this Simon was a bad Indian, who, when in drink, was apt to be
saucy and quarrelsome; but that his wife was quite a decent body for
a savage, having long maintained herself and children and her
lazy, cross husband, by hard labor in the cornfields and at the
fisheries.

Haverhill lieth very pleasantly on the river-side; the land about
hilly and broken, but of good quality. Mr. Saltonstall liveth in
a stately house for these parts, not far from that of his
father-in-law, the learned Mr.

Ward. Madam, his wife, is a fair, pleasing young woman, not unused to
society, their house being frequented by many of the first people
hereabout, as well as by strangers of distinction from other parts
of the country.

We had hardly got well through our dinner (which was abundant and
savory, being greatly relished by our hunger), when two gentlemen
came riding up to the door; and on their coming in, we found them
to be the young Doctor Clark, of Boston, a son of the old Newbury
physician, and a Doctor Benjamin Thompson, of Roxbury, who I hear
is not a little famous for his ingenious poetry and witty pieces
on many subjects.

He was, moreover, an admirer of my cousin Rebecca; and on learning of
her betrothal to Sir Thomas did write a most despairing verse to
her, comparing himself to all manner of lonesome things, so that
when Rebecca showed it to me, I told her I did fear the poor
young gentleman would put an end to himself, by reason of his
great sorrow and disquiet; whereat she laughed merrily, bidding
me not fear, for she knew the writer too well to be troubled thereat,
for he loved nobody so well as himself, and that under no provocation
would he need the Apostle's advice to the jailer, "Do thyself no
harm."

All which I found to be true,--he being a gay, witty man, full of a
fine conceit of himself, which is not so much to be marvelled
at, as he hath been greatly flattered and sought after.

The excellent Mr. Ward spent the evening with us; a pleasant, social
old man, much beloved by his people. He told us a great deal about
the early settlement of the town, and of the grievous hardships
which many did undergo the first season, from cold, and hunger, and
sickness.

He thought, however, that, with all their ease and worldly
prosperity, the present generation were less happy and contented
than their fathers; for there was now a great striving to outdo
each other in luxury and gay apparel; the Lord's day was not
so well kept as formerly; and the drinking of spirits and frequenting
of ordinaries and places of public resort vastly increased. Mr.
Saltonstall said the war did not a little demoralize the people, and
that since the soldiers cause back, there had been much trouble
in Church and State. The General Court, two years ago, had
made severe laws against the provoking evils of the
times:
profaneness, Sabbath-breaking, drinking, and revelling to excess,
loose and sinful conduct on the part of the young and unmarried,
pride in dress, attending Quakers' meetings, and neglect of attendance
upon divine worship; but these laws had never been well enforced;
and he feared too many of the magistrates were in the condition
of the Dutch Justice in the New York Province, who, when a woman
was brought before him charged with robbing a henroost, did request
his brother on the bench to pass sentence upon her; for, said he,
if I send her to the whipping post, the wench will cry out against
me as her accomplice.

Doctor Clark said his friend Doctor Thompson had written a long
piece on this untoward state of our affairs, which he hoped soon to
see in print, inasmuch as it did hold the looking-glass to the face
of this generation, and shame it by a comparison with that of the
generation which has passed. Mr. Ward said he was glad to hear of
it, and hoped his ingenious friend had brought the manuscript with
him; whereupon, the young gentleman said he did take it along with
him, in the hope to benefit it by Mr.

Ward's judgment and learning, and with the leave of the company he
would read the Prologue thereof.

To which we all agreeing, he read what follows, which I copy from his
book:--

"The times wherein old PUMPKIN was a saint, When men fared hardly, yet
without complaint, On vilest cates; the dainty Indian maize Was eat
with clam-shells out of wooden trays, Under thatched roofs, without
the cry of rent, And the best sauce to every dish, content,-- These
golden times (too fortunate to hold) Were quickly sinned away for
love of gold.
'T was then among the bushes, not the street, If one in place did
an inferior meet, 'Good morrow, brother! Is there aught you
want?

Take freely of me what I have, you ha'n't.' Plain Tom and Dick
would pass as current now, As ever since 'Your servant, sir,' and
bow.

Deep-skirted doublets, puritanic capes, Which now would render men
like upright apes, Was comelier wear, our wise old fathers thought,
Than the cast fashions from all Europe brought.
'T was in those days an honest grace would hold Till an hot pudding
grew at heart a-cold, And men had better stomachs for religion,
Than now for capon, turkey-cock, or pigeon; When honest sisters met
to pray, not prate, About their own and not their neighbors' state,
During Plain Dealing's reign, that worthy stud Of the ancient
planter-race before the Flood.

"These times were good: merchants cared not a rush For other fare
than jonakin and mush.
And though men fared and lodged very hard, Yet innocence was better
than a guard.

'T was long before spiders and worms had drawn Their dingy webs, or
hid with cheating lawn New England's beauties, which still seemed
to me Illustrious in their own simplicity.
'T was ere the neighboring Virgin Land had broke The hogsheads of her
worse than hellish smoke; 'T was ere the Islands sent their
presents in, Which but to use was counted next to sin; 'T was ere
a barge had made so rich a freight As chocolate, dust-gold, and
bits of eight; Ere wines from France and Muscovado too, Without the
which the drink will scarcely do.
From Western Isles, ere fruits and delicacies Did rot maids' teeth
and spoil their handsome faces, Or ere these times did chance the
noise of war Was from our tines and hearts removed far, Then had
the churches rest: as yet, the coals Were covered up in most
contentious souls; Freeness in judgment, union in affection, Dear
love, sound truth, they were our grand protection.

Then were the times in which our Councils sat, These grave prognostics
of our future state; If these be longer lived, our hopes increase,
These wars will usher in a longer peace; But if New England's love
die in its youth, The grave will open next for blessed truth.

"This theme is out of date; the peaceful hours When castles needed
not, but pleasant bowers, Not ink, but blood and tears now serve the
turn To draw the figure of New England's urn.
New England's hour of passion is at hand, No power except Divine can
it withstand.

Scarce hath her glass of fifty years run out, Than her old prosperous
steeds turn heads about; Tracking themselves back to their poor
beginnings, To fear and fare upon the fruits of sinnings.

So that this mirror of the Christian world Lies burnt
to heaps in part, her streamers furled.

Grief sighs, joys flee, and dismal fears surprise, Not dastard spirits
only, but the wise.

"Thus have the fairest hopes deceived the eye Of the big-swoln
expectants standing by So the proud ship, after a little turn,
Sinks in the ocean's arms to find its urn:
Thus hath the heir to many thousands born Been in an instant from
the mother torn; Even thus thy infant cheek begins to pale, And thy
supporters through great losses fail.

This is the Prologue to thy future woe-- The Epilogue no mortal yet
can know."

Mr. Ward was much pleased with the verses, saying that they would
do honor to any writer.

Rebecca thought the lines concerning the long grace at meat happy,
and said she was minded of the wife of the good Mr. Ames, who
prided herself on her skill in housewifery and cookery; and on one
occasion, seeing a nice pair of roasted fowls growing cold under
her husband's long grace, was fain to jog his elbow, telling him
that if he did not stop soon, she feared they would have small
occasion for thankfulness for their spoiled dinner.

Mr. Ward said he was once travelling in company with Mr.
Phillips of Rowley, and Mr.

Parker of Newbury, and stopping all night at a poor house near the
sea-shore, the woman thereof brought into the room for their supper
a great wooden tray, full of something nicely covered up by a clean
linen cloth. It proved to be a dish of boiled clams, in their
shells; and as Mr. Phillips was remarkable in his thanks for aptly
citing passages of Scripture with regard to whatsoever food was upon
the table before him, Mr. Parker and himself did greatly wonder what
he could say of this dish; but he, nothing put to it, offered thanks
that now, as formerly, the Lord's people were enabled to partake
of the abundance of the seas, and treasures hid in the sands.

"Whereat," said Mr. Ward, "we did find it so hard to keep grave
countenances, that our good hostess was not a little disturbed,
thinking we were mocking her poor fare; and we were fain to tell her
the cause of our mirth, which was indeed ill-timed."

Doctor Clark spake of Mr. Ward's father, the renowned minister at
Ipswich, whose book of "The Simple Cobbler of Agawam," was much
admired.

Mr. Ward said that some of the witty turns therein did give much
offence at the time of its printing, but that his father could
never spoil his joke for the sake of friends, albeit he had no
malice towards any one, and was always ready to do a good, even to
his enemies.

He once even greatly angered his old and true friend, Mr. Cotton
of Boston. "It fell out in this wise," said Mr. Ward.

"When the arch-heretic and fanatic Gorton and his crew were in
prison in Boston, my father and Mr. Cotton went to the jail window
to see them; and after some little discourse with them, he told
Gorton that if he had done or said anything which he could with a
clear conscience renounce, he would do well to recant the same, and
the Court, he doubted not, would be merciful; adding, that it would
be no disparagement for him to do so, as the best of men were liable
to err: as, for instance, his brother Cotton here generally did
preach that one year which he publicly repented of before his
congregation the next year."

Mr. Saltonstall told another story of old Mr. Ward, which made us all
merry. There was a noted Antinomian, of Boston, who used to go much
about the country disputing with all who would listen to
him, who, coming to Ipswich one night, with another of his sort
with him, would fain have tarried with Mr.

Ward; but he told them that he had scarce hay and grain enough in
his barn for the use of his own cattle, and that they would do well
to take their horses to the ordinary, where they would be better
cared for. But the fellow, not wishing to be so put off, bade him
consider what the Scripture said touching the keeping of strangers,
as some had thereby entertained angels unawares. "True, my friend,"
said Mr. Ward, "but we don't read that the angels came
a-horseback!"
The evening passed away in a very pleasant and agreeable manner. We
had rare nuts, and apples, and pears, of Mr. Saltonstall's
raising, wonderfully sweet and luscious.

Our young gentlemen, moreover, seemed to think the wine and ale
of good quality; for, long after we had gone to our beds, we could
hear them talking and laughing in the great hall below, notwithstanding
that Mr. Ward, when he took leave, bade Doctor Thompson take heed
to his own hint concerning the:
"Wines from France and Muscovado too;"
to which the young wit replied, that there was Scripture warrant
for his drinking, inasmuch as the command was, to give wine to those
that be of heavy heart.

Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no
more; and, for his part, he had been little better than miserable
ever since he heard of Rebecca's betrothal. A light, careless man,
but of good parts, and as brave a talker as I have heard since I
have been in the Colony.

November 24.

Mr. Ward's negro girl Dinah came for me yesterday, saying that her
master did desire to see me. So, marvelling greatly what he wanted,
I went with her, and was shown into the study.

Mr. Ward said he had sent for me to have some discourse in regard
to my brother Leonard, who he did greatly fear was likely to make
shipwreck of the faith; and that Mr. Richardson had written him
concerning the young man, telling him that he did visit the
Quakers when at Newbury, and even went over to their conventicle
at Hampton, on the Lord's day, in the company of the Brewster family,
noted Quakers and ranters.

He had the last evening had some words with the lad, but with small
satisfaction. Being sorely troubled by this account, I begged him
to send for Leonard, which he did, and, when he did come into the
room, Mr. Ward told him that he might see by the plight of his
sister (for I was in tears) what a great grief he was like
to bring upon his family and friends, by running out into heresies.
Leonard said he was sorry to give trouble to any one, least of all
to his beloved sister; that he did indeed go to the Quakers'
meeting, on one occasion, to judge for himself concerning this
people, who are everywhere spoken against; and that he must say he
did hear or see nothing in their worship contrary to the Gospel.

Cecilia, to whom he grew daily more disagreeable, coldly declined
his assistance, while she readily accepted that which had first been
offered her by Mr Belfield.

The haughty Baronet, extremely nettled, forced his way on, and
rudely stalking up to Mr Belfield, motioned with his hand for room
to pass him, and said, "Make way, sir!"

"Make way for _me_, Sir!" cried Belfield, opposing him with one
hand, while with the other he held Cecilia.

"You, Sir? and who are you, Sir?" demanded the Baronet,
disdainfully.

"Of that, Sir, I shall give you an account whenever you please,"
answered Belfield, with equal scorn.

"What the devil do you mean, Sir?"

"Nothing very difficult to be understood," replied Belfield, and
attempted to draw on Cecilia, who, much alarmed, was shrinking back.

Sir Robert then, swelling with rage, reproachfully turned to her,
and said, "Will you suffer such an impertinent fellow as that, Miss
Beverley, to have the honour of taking your hand?"

Belfield, with great indignation, demanded what he meant by the term
impertinent fellow; and Sir Robert yet more insolently repeated it:
Cecilia, extremely shocked, earnestly besought them both to be
quiet; but Belfield, at the repetition of this insult, hastily let
go her hand and put his own upon his sword, whilst Sir Robert,
taking advantage of his situation in being a step higher than his
antagonist, fiercely pushed him back, and descended into the lobby.

Belfield, enraged beyond endurance, instantly drew his sword, and
Sir Robert was preparing to follow his example, when Cecilia, in an
agony of fright, called out, "Good Heaven! will nobody interfere?"
And then a young man, forcing his way through the crowd, exclaimed,
"For shame, for shame, gentlemen! is this a place for such
violence?"

Belfield, endeavouring to recover himself, put up his sword, and,
though in a voice half choaked with passion, said, "I thank you,
Sir! I was off my guard. I beg pardon of the whole company."

Then, walking up to Sir Robert, he put into his hand a card with his
name and direction, saying, "With you, Sir, I shall be happy to
settle what apologies are necessary at your first leisure;" and
hurried away.

Sir Robert, exclaiming aloud that he should soon teach him to whom
he had been so impertinent, was immediately going to follow him,
when the affrighted Cecilia again called out aloud, "Oh, stop him!--
good God! will nobody stop him!"

The rapidity with which this angry scene had passed had filled her
with amazement, and the evident resentment of the Baronet upon her
refusing his assistance, gave her an immediate consciousness that
she was herself the real cause of the quarrel; while the manner in
which he was preparing to follow Mr Belfield convinced her of the
desperate scene which was likely to succeed; fear, therefore,
overcoming every other feeling, forced from her this exclamation
before she knew what she said.

The moment she had spoken, the young man who had already interposed
again rushed forward, and seizing Sir Robert by the arm, warmly
remonstrated against the violence of his proceedings, and being
presently seconded by other gentlemen, almost compelled him to give
up his design.

Then, hastening to Cecilia, "Be not alarmed, madam," he cried, "all
is over, and every body is safe."

Cecilia, finding herself thus addressed by a gentleman she had never
before seen, felt extremely ashamed of having rendered her interest
in the debate so apparent; she courtsied to him in some confusion,
and taking hold of Mrs Harrel's arm, hurried her back into the pit,
in order to quit a crowd, of which she now found herself the
principal object.

Curiosity, however, was universally excited, and her retreat served
but to inflame it: some of the ladies, and most of the gentlemen,
upon various pretences, returned into the pit merely to look at her,
and in a few minutes the report was current that the young lady who
had been the occasion of the quarrel, was dying with love for Sir
Robert Floyer.

Mr Monckton, who had kept by her side during the whole affair, felt
thunderstruck by the emotion she had shewn; Mr Arnott too, who had
never quitted her, wished himself exposed to the same danger as Sir
Robert, so that he might be honoured with the same concern: but they
were both too much the dupes of their own apprehensions and
jealousy, to perceive that what they instantly imputed to fondness,
proceeded simply from general humanity, accidentally united with the
consciousness of being accessary to the quarrel.

The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the
disputants, in a few moments followed her with a glass of water,
which he had brought from the coffee-room, begging her to drink it
and compose herself.

Cecilia, though she declined his civility with more vexation than
gratitude, perceived, as she raised her eyes to thank him, that her
new friend was a young man very strikingly elegant in his address
and appearance.

Miss Larolles next, who, with her party, came back into the pit, ran
up to Cecilia, crying, "O my dear creature, what a monstrous
shocking thing! You've no Idea how I am frightened; do you know I
happened to be quite at the further end of the coffee-room when it
began, and I could not get out to see what was the matter for ten
ages; only conceive what a situation!"

Such whirling masses of hot vapors, inferred exceed two inches in
one second from Sir Joseph Thomson's results to contain electrically
charged particles, should give rise to a magnetic field.

This hypothesis at once suggested that the double lines observed by
Young might really represent the Zeeman effect. The test was made,
and all the characteristic phenomena of radiation in a magnetic field
were found. Thus a great physical experiment constantly being
performed for us in the sun.

These striking phenomena, though cooler than the general atmosphere
of the sun,, are at temperatures of several thousand degrees,

powerful electric furnaces.

It is interesting, to follow our line of reasoning to the stars,
which differ widely in temperature at various stages in their
life-cycle.[*] A sun-spot is a solar tornado, the intensely hot
solar vapors are cooled by expansion in, giving rise to the compounds
already named.

A red star, in Russell's scheme of stellar evolution, is a

NEWTON AND Take, for another example, the greatest law of
physics--Newton's law of gravitation moment, even with the
brightest light-sources available, that great experimental skill
is required to measure it the. Yet in the case of some of the larger
stars Eddington calculates that one-half of their mass is supported
by radiation pressure, and this against their enormous gravitational
attraction.

In fact, if their mass were as great as ten times that. Huge balls
of lead, as used by Cavendish, produce by their gravitational
effect a minute rotation of a delicately suspended bar, carrying
smaller balls at its extremities.

But no such feeble means sufficed for Newton's purpose. To prove the
law of gravitation he had recourse to the tremendous pull on the
moon of the entire mass of the earth, and then extended his researches
to the mutual attractions of all the bodies of the solar system.

Later Herschel applied this law array of other appliances available
for the measurement and analysis of radiation. Gilbert's" De Magnete"

All of the three chief tests of Einstein's general theory are

The outer part of these bodies, from light reaches us, must therefore
be at a temperature of merely a few thousand degrees, but vastly
higher temperatures must prevail at a magnetic field. When subjected
to the influence of magnetism, right of the fact that one of the
three greatest problems of modern astronomy and astrophysics,
ranking with the structure of the universe and the evolution of
celestial bodies, is the constitution of matter their centres.

In passing up the temperature curve more and reside in the slow

Cook has calculated that the pressure at the centre of the earth

only a very small fraction of that attained but within larger

made for the purpose of advancing our knowledge of such fundamental
subjects as physics and chemistry.

On the contrary, if true to his name, he should help to multiply
them many fold in the interest of economic and commercial development.
"To me, Sir, they have, I believe, no pretensions at all."

"I see you are shy," returned he, with encreasing gentleness, "I see
you cannot be easy with me; and when I consider how little you are
accustomed to me, I do not wonder. But pray take courage; I think it
necessary to inform myself of your affairs, and therefore I beg you
will speak to me with freedom."

Cecilia, more and more mortified by this humiliating condescension,
again assured him he had been misinformed, and was again, though
discredited, praised for her modesty, when, to her great relief,
they were interrupted by the entrance of her friend the _white
domino_.

"Mortimer," said Mr Delvile, "I understand you have already had the
pleasure of seeing this young lady?"

"Yes, Sir," he answered, "I have more than once had that happiness,
but I have never had the honour of being introduced to her."

"Miss Beverley, then," said the father, "I must present to you Mr
Mortimer Delvile, my son; and, Mortimer, in Miss Beverley I desire
you will remember that you respect a ward of your father's."

"I will not, Sir," answered he, "forget an injunction my own
inclinations had already out-run."

Mortimer Delvile was tall and finely formed, his features, though
not handsome, were full of expression, and a noble openness of
manners and address spoke the elegance of his education, and the
liberality of his mind.

When this introduction was over, a more general conversation took
place, till Mr Delvile, suddenly rising, said to Cecilia, "You will
pardon me, Miss Beverley, if I leave you for a few minutes; one of
my tenants sets out to-morrow morning for my estate in the North,
and he has been two hours waiting to speak with me. But if my son is
not particularly engaged, I am sure he will be so good as to do the
honours of the house till his mother is ready to receive you."

And then, graciously waving his hand, he quitted the room.

"My father," cried young Delvile, "has left me an office which,
could I execute it as perfectly as I shall willingly, would be
performed without a fault."

"I am very sorry," said Cecilia, "that I have so much mistaken your
hour of breakfast; but let me not be any restraint upon you, I shall
find a book, or a newspaper, or something to fill up the time till
Mrs Delvile honours me with a summons."

"You can only be a restraint upon me," answered he, "by commanding
me from your presence. I breakfasted long ago, and am now just come
from Mr Belfield. I had the pleasure, this morning, of being
admitted into his room."

"And how, Sir, did you find him?"

"Not so well, I fear, as he thinks himself; but he was in high
spirits, and surrounded by his friends, whom he was entertaining
with all the gaiety of a man in full health, and entirely at his
ease; though I perceived, by the frequent changes of his
countenance, signs of pain and indisposition, that made me, however
pleased with his conversation, think it necessary to shorten my own
visit, and to hint to those who were near me the propriety of
leaving him quiet."

"Did you see his surgeon, Sir?"

"No; but he told me he should only have one dressing more of his
wound, and then get rid of the whole business by running into the
country."

"Were you acquainted with him, Sir, before this accident?"

"No, not at all; but the little I have seen of him has strongly
interested me in his favour: at Mr Harrel's masquerade, where I
first met with him, I was extremely entertained by his humour,--
though there, perhaps, as I had also the honour of first seeing Miss
Beverley, I might be too happy to feel much difficulty in being
pleased. And even at the Opera he had the advantage of finding me in
the same favourable disposition, as I had long distinguished you
before I had taken any notice of him. I must, however, confess I did
not think his anger that evening quite without provocation,--but I
beg your pardon, I may perhaps be mistaken, and you, who know the
whole affair, must undoubtedly be better able to account for what
happened."

Here he fixed his eyes upon Cecilia, with a look of curiosity that
seemed eager to penetrate into her sentiments of the two
antagonists.

"No, certainly," she answered, "he had all the provocation that ill-
breeding could give him."

"And do you, madam," cried he, with much surprize, "judge of this
matter with such severity?"

"No, not with severity, simply with candour."

"With candour? alas, then, poor Sir Robert! Severity were not half
so bad a sign for him!"

A servant now came in, to acquaint Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited
breakfast for her.

This summons was immediately followed by the re-entrance of Mr
Delvile, who, taking her hand, said he would himself present her to
his lady, and with much graciousness assured her of a kind
reception.

The ceremonies preceding this interview, added to the character she
had already heard of Mrs Delvile, made Cecilia heartily wish it
over; but, assuming all the courage in her power, she determined to
support herself with a spirit that should struggle against the
ostentatious superiority she was prepared to expect.

She found her seated upon a sofa, from which, however, she arose at
her approach; but the moment Cecilia beheld her, all the
unfavourable impressions with which she came into her presence
immediately vanished, and that respect which the formalities of her
introduction had failed to inspire, her air, figure, and countenance
instantaneously excited.

She was not more than fifty years of age; her complection, though
faded, kept the traces of its former loveliness, her eyes, though
they had lost their youthful fire, retained a lustre that evinced
their primeval brilliancy, and the fine symmetry of her features,
still uninjured by the siege of time, not only indicated the
perfection of her juvenile beauty, but still laid claim to
admiration in every beholder. Her carriage was lofty and commanding;
but the dignity to which high birth and conscious superiority gave
rise, was so judiciously regulated by good sense, and so happily
blended with politeness, that though the world at large envied or
hated her, the few for whom she had herself any regard, she was
infallibly certain to captivate.

The surprise and admiration with which Cecilia at the first glance
was struck proved reciprocal: Mrs Delvile, though prepared for youth
and beauty, expected not to see a countenance so intelligent, nor
manners so well formed as those of Cecilia: thus mutually astonished
and mutually pleased, their first salutations were accompanied by
looks so flattering to both, that each saw in the other, an
immediate prepossession in her favour, and from the moment that they
met, they seemed instinctively impelled to admire.

"I have promised Miss Beverley, madam," said Mr Delvile to his lady,
"that you would give her a kind reception; and I need not remind you
that my promises are always held sacred."

"But I hope you have not also promised," cried she, with quickness,
"that I should give _you_ a kind reception, for I feel at this
very moment extremely inclined to quarrel with you."

"Why so, madam?"

"For not bringing us together sooner; for now I have seen her, I
already look back with regret to the time I have lost without the
pleasure of knowing her."

"What a claim is this," cried young Delvile, "upon the benevolence
of Miss Beverley! for if she has not now the indulgence by frequent
and diligent visits to make some reparation, she must consider
herself as responsible for the dissension she will occasion."

"If peace depends upon my visits," answered Cecilia, "it may
immediately be proclaimed; were it to be procured only by my
absence, I know not if I should so readily agree to the conditions."

"I must request of you, madam," said Mr Delvile, "that when my son
and I retire, you will bestow half an hour upon this young lady, in
making enquiries concerning the disturbance last Saturday at the
Opera-house. I have not, myself, so much time to spare, as I have
several appointments for this morning; but I am sure you will not
object to the office, as I know you to be equally anxious with
myself, that the minority of Miss Beverley should pass without
reproach."

"Not only her minority, but her maturity," cried young Delvile,
warmly, "and not only her maturity, but her decline of life will
pass, I hope, not merely without reproach, but with fame and
applause!"

"I hope so too;" replied Mr Delvile: "I wish her well through every
stage of her life, but for her minority alone it is my business to
do more than wish. For that, I feel my own honour and my own credit
concerned; my honour, as I gave it to the Dean that I would
superintend her conduct, and my credit, as the world is acquainted
with the claim she has to my protection."

"I will not make any enquiries," said Mrs Delvile, turning to
Cecilia with a sweetness that recompensed her for the haughtiness of
her guardian, "till I have had some opportunity of convincing Miss
Beverley, that my regard for her merits they should be answered."

"You see, Miss Beverley," said Mr Delvile, "how little reason you
had to be afraid of us; Mrs Delvile is as much disposed in your
favour as myself, and as desirous to be of service to you.
Endeavour, therefore, to cast off this timidity, and to make
yourself easy. You must come to us often; use will do more towards
removing your fears, than all the encouragement we can give you."

"But what are the fears," cried Mrs Delvile, "that Miss Beverley can
have to remove? unless, indeed, she apprehends her visits will make
us encroachers, and that the more we are favoured with her presence,
the less we shall bear her absence."

"Pray, son," said Mr Delvile, "what was the name of the person who
was Sir Robert Floyer's opponent? I have again forgotten it."

"Belfield, sir."

"True; it is a name I am perfectly unacquainted with: however, he
may possibly be a very good sort of man; but certainly his opposing
himself to Sir Robert Floyer, a man of some family, a gentleman,
rich, and allied to some people of distinction, was a rather strange
circumstance: I mean not, however, to prejudge the case; I will hear
it fairly stated; and am the more disposed to be cautious in what I
pronounce, because I am persuaded Miss Beverley has too much sense
to let my advice be thrown away upon her."

"I hope so, Sir; but with respect to the disturbance at the Opera, I
know not that I have the least occasion to trouble you."

"If your measures," said he, very gravely, "are already taken, the
Dean your uncle prevailed upon me to accept a very useless office;
but if any thing is yet undecided, it will not, perhaps, be amiss
that I should be consulted. Mean time, I will only recommend to you
to consider that Mr Belfield is a person whose name nobody has
heard, and that a connection with Sir Robert Floyer would certainly
be very honourable for you."

"Indeed, Sir," said Cecilia, "here is some great mistake; neither of
these gentlemen, I believe, think of me at all."

"They have taken, then," cried young Delvile with a laugh, "a very
extraordinary method to prove their indifference!"

"The affairs of Sir Robert Floyer," continued Mr Delvile, "are
indeed, I am informed, in some disorder; but he has a noble estate,
and your fortune would soon clear all its incumbrances. Such an
alliance, therefore, would be mutually advantageous: but what would
result from a union with such a person as Mr Belfield? he is of no
family, though in that, perhaps, you would not be very scrupulous;
but neither has he any money; what, then, recommends him?"

"To me, Sir, nothing!" answered Cecilia.

"And to me," cried young Delvile, "almost every thing! he has wit,
spirit, and understanding, talents to create admiration, and
qualities, I believe, to engage esteem!"

"You speak warmly," said Mrs Delvile; "but if such is his character,
he merits your earnestness. What is it you know of him?"

"Not enough, perhaps," answered he, "to coolly justify my praise;
but he is one of those whose first appearance takes the mind by
surprise, and leaves the judgment to make afterwards such terms as
it can. Will you, madam, when he is recovered, permit me to
introduce him to you?"

"Certainly;" said she, smiling; "but have a care your recommendation
does not disgrace your discernment."

"This warmth of disposition, Mortimer," cried Mr Delvile, "produces
nothing but difficulties and trouble: you neglect the connections I
point out, and which a little attention might render serviceable as
well as honourable, and run precipitately into forming such as can
do you no good among people of rank, and are not only profitless in
themselves, but generally lead you into expence and inconvenience.
You are now of an age to correct this rashness: think, therefore,
better of your own consequence, than thus idly to degrade yourself
by forming friendships with every shewy adventurer that comes in
your way."

"I know not, Sir," answered he, "how Mr Belfield deserves to be
called an adventurer: he is not, indeed, rich; but he is in a
profession where parts such as his seldom fail to acquire riches;
however, as to me his wealth can be of no consequence, why should my
regard to him wait for it? if he is a young man of worth and
honour--"

"Mortimer," interrupted Mr Delvile, "whatever he is, we know he is
not a man of rank, and whatever he may be, we know he cannot become
a man of family, and consequently for Mortimer Delvile he is no
companion. If you can render him any service, I shall commend your
so doing; it becomes your birth, it becomes your station in life to
assist individuals, and promote the general good: but never in your
zeal for others forget what is due to yourself, and to the ancient
and honourable house from which you are sprung."

"But can we entertain Miss Beverley with nothing better than family
lectures?" cried Mrs Delvile.

"It is for me," said young Delvile, rising, "to beg pardon of Miss
Beverley for having occasioned them: but when she is so good as to
honour us with her company again, I hope I shall have more
discretion."

He then left the room; and Mr Delvile also rising to go, said, "My
dear, I commit you to very kind hands; Mrs Delvile, I am sure, will
be happy to hear your story; speak to her, therefore, without
reserve. And pray don't imagine that I make you over to her from any
slight; on the contrary, I admire and commend your modesty very
much; but my time is extremely precious, and I cannot devote so much
of it to an explanation as your diffidence requires."

And then, to the great joy of Cecilia, he retired; leaving her much
in doubt whether his haughtiness or his condescension humbled her
most.

"These men," said Mrs Delvile, "can never comprehend the pain of a
delicate female mind upon entering into explanations of this sort: I
understand it, however, too well to inflict it. We will, therefore,
have no explanations at all till we are better acquainted, and then
if you will venture to favour me with any confidence, my best
advice, and, should any be in my power, my best services shall be at
your command."

"You do me, madam, much honour," answered Cecilia, "but I must
assure you I have no explanation to give."

"Well, well, at present," returned Mrs Delvile, "I am content to
hear that answer, as I have acquired no right to any other: but
hereafter I shall hope for more openness: it is promised me by your
countenance, and I mean to claim the promise by my friendship."

"Your friendship will both honour and delight me, and whatever are
your enquiries, I shall always be proud to answer them; but indeed,
with regard to this affair--"

"My dear Miss Beverley," interrupted Mrs Delvile, with a look of
arch incredulity, "men seldom risk their lives where an escape is
without hope of recompence. But we will not now say a word more upon
the subject. I hope you will often favour me with your company, and
by the frequency of your visits, make us both forget the shortness
of our acquaintance."

Cecilia, finding her resistance only gave birth to fresh suspicion,
now yielded, satisfied that a very little time must unavoidably
clear up the truth. But her visit was not therefore shortened; the
sudden partiality with which the figure and countenance of Mrs
Delvile had impressed her, was quickly ripened into esteem by the
charms of her conversation: she found her sensible, well bred, and
high spirited, gifted by nature with superior talents, and polished
by education and study with all the elegant embellishments of
cultivation. She saw in her, indeed, some portion of the pride she
had been taught to expect, but it was so much softened by elegance,
and so well tempered with kindness, that it elevated her character,
without rendering her manners offensive.

With such a woman, subjects of discourse could never be wanting, nor
fertility of powers to make them entertaining: and so much was
Cecilia delighted with her visit, that though her carriage was
announced at twelve o'clock, she reluctantly concluded it at two;
and in taking her leave, gladly accepted an invitation to dine with
her new friend three days after; who, equally pleased with her young
guest, promised before that time to return her visit.


CHAPTER vii

AN EXAMINATION.

Cecilia found Mrs Harrel eagerly waiting to hear some account how
she had passed the morning, and fully persuaded that she would leave
the Delviles with a determination never more, but by necessity, to
see them: she was, therefore, not only surprised but disappointed,
when instead of fulfilling her expectations, she assured her that
she had been delighted with Mrs Delvile, whose engaging qualities
amply recompensed her for the arrogance of her husband; that her
visit had no fault but that of being too short, and that she had
already appointed an early day for repeating it.

Mrs Harrel was evidently hurt by this praise, and Cecilia, who
perceived among all her guardians a powerful disposition to hatred
and jealousy, soon dropt the subject: though so much had she been
charmed with Mrs Delvile, that a scheme of removal once more
occurred to her, notwithstanding her dislike of her stately
guardian.

At dinner, as usual, they were joined by Sir Robert Floyer, who grew
more and more assiduous in his attendance, but who, this day,
contrary to his general custom of remaining with the gentlemen, made
his exit before the ladies left the table; and as soon as he was
gone, Mr Harrel desired a private conference with Cecilia.

They went together to the drawing-room, where, after a flourishing
preface upon the merits of Sir Robert Floyer, he formally acquainted
her that he was commissioned by that gentleman, to make her a tender
of his hand and fortune.

Cecilia, who had not much reason to be surprised at this overture,
desired him to tell the Baronet, she was obliged to him for the
honour he intended her, at the same time that she absolutely
declined receiving it.

Mr Harrel, laughing, told her this answer was very well for a
beginning, though it would by no means serve beyond the first day of
the declaration; but when Cecilia assured him she should firmly
adhere to it, he remonstrated with equal surprise and discontent
upon the reasons of her refusal. She thought it sufficient to tell
him that Sir Robert did not please her, but, with much raillery, he
denied the assertion credit, assuring her that he was universally
admired by the ladies, that she could not possibly receive a more
honourable offer, and that he was reckoned by every body the finest
gentleman about the town. His fortune, he added, was equally
unexceptionable with his figure and his rank in life; all the world,
he was certain, would approve the connexion, and the settlement made
upon her should be dictated by herself.

Cecilia begged him to be satisfied with an answer which she never
could change, and to spare her the enumeration of particular
objections, since Sir Robert was wholly and in every respect
disagreeable to her.

"What, then," cried he, "could make you so frightened for him at the
Opera-house? There has been but one opinion about town ever since of
your prepossession in his favour."

"I am extremely concerned to hear it; my fright was but the effect
of surprise, and belonged not more to Sir Robert than to Mr
Belfield."

He told her that nobody else thought the same, that her marriage
with the Baronet was universally expected, and, in conclusion,
notwithstanding her earnest desire that he would instantly and
explicitly inform Sir Robert of her determination, he repeatedly
refused to give him any final answer till she had taken more time
for consideration.

Cecilia was extremely displeased at this irksome importunity, and
still more chagrined to find her incautious emotion at the Opera-
house, had given rise to suspicions of her harbouring a partiality
for a man whom every day she more heartily disliked.

While she was deliberating in what manner she could clear up this
mistake, which, after she was left alone, occupied all her thoughts,
she was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Monckton, whose joy in
meeting her at length by herself exceeded not her own, for charmed
as he was that he could now examine into the state of her affairs,
she was not less delighted that she could make them known to him.

After mutual expressions, guarded, however, on the part of Mr.
Monckton, though unreserved on that of Cecilia, of their
satisfaction in being again able to converse as in former times, he
asked if she would permit him, as the privilege of their long
acquaintance, to speak to her with sincerity.

She assured him he could not more oblige her.

"Let me, then," said he, "enquire if yet that ardent confidence in
your own steadiness, which so much disdained my fears that the
change of your residence might produce a change in your sentiments,
is still as unshaken as when we parted in Suffolk? Or whether
experience, that foe to unpractised refinement, has already taught
you the fallibility of theory?"

"When I assure you," replied Cecilia, "that your enquiry gives me no
pain, I think I have sufficiently answered it, for were I conscious
of any alteration, it could not but embarrass and distress me. Very
far, however, from finding myself in the danger with which you
threatened me, of _forgetting Bury, its inhabitants and its
environs_, I think with pleasure of little else, since London,
instead of bewitching, has greatly disappointed me."

"How so?" cried Mr Monckton, much delighted.

"Not," answered she, "in itself, not in its magnificence, nor in its
diversions, which seem to be inexhaustible; but these, though
copious as instruments of pleasure, are very shallow as sources of
happiness: the disappointment, therefore, comes nearer home, and
springs not from London, but from my own situation."

M.

G---- embarked himself for Mexico yesterday morning, and carried
them all with him!"
Imagine the consternation and rage of poor Mr. Schulemberg at
finding that he was sold, though the goods were not! I decline
reporting the conversation any farther, lest its strength
of expression and force of expletive might be too much for the
more queasy of my readers.

Suffice it to say, that the _swindlee_, if I may be allowed the
royalty of coining a word, at once freed his own mind and
imprisoned the body of M. M. ----; for in those days imprisonment
for debt was a recognized institution, and I think few of its strongest
opponents will deny that this was a case to which it was no abuse
to apply it.

IV.

I regret that I am compelled to leave this exemplary merchant in
captivity; but the exigencies of my story, the moral of which beckons
me away to the distant coast of Mexico, require it at my
hands. The reader may be consoled, however, by the knowledge that he
obtained his liberation in due time, his Dutch creditor being entirely
satisfied that nothing whatsoever could be squeezed out of him
by passing him between the bars of the debtor's prison, though that
was all the satisfaction he ever did get. How he accompanied his
young wife to Europe and there lived by the coining of her voice
into drachmas, as her father had done before him, needs not to be
told here; nor yet how she was divorced from him, and made another
matrimonial venture in partnership with De B----.

I have nothing to do with him or her, after the bargain and sale
of which she was the object, and the consequences which immediately
resulted from it; and here, accordingly, I take my leave of them.
But my story is not quite done yet; it must now pursue the fortunes
of the enterprising _impresario_, Signor G----, who had so deftly
turned his daughter into a ship-load of fine linens.

This excellent person sailed, as M. M. ---- told Mr. Schulemberg, for
Vera Cruz, with an assorted cargo, consisting of singers, fiddlers,
and, as aforesaid, of Mynheer Van Holland's fine linens.

The voyage was as prosperous as was due to such an argosy. If a
single Amphion could not be drowned by the utmost malice of
gods and men, so long as he kept his voice in order, what possible
mishap could befall a whole ship-load of them?

The vessel arrived safely under the shadow of San Juan de Ulua, and
her precious freight in all its varieties was welcomed
with a tropical enthusiasm. The market was bare of linen and of
song, and it was hard to say which found the readiest sale. Competition
raised the price of both articles to a fabulous height.

So the good G---- had the benevolent satisfaction of clothing the
naked and making the ears that heard him to bless him at the same
time. After selling his linens at a great advance on the
cost price, considering he had only paid his daughter for them, and
having given a series of the most successful concerts ever known
in those latitudes, Signor G---- set forth for the Aztec City. As
the relations of _meum_ and _tuum_ were not upon the most satisfactory
footing just then at Vera Cruz, he thought it most prudent to carry
his well-won treasure with him to the capital.

His progress thither was a triumphal procession. Not Cortés,
not General Scott, himself, marched more gloriously along the steep
and rugged road that leads from the sea-coast to the table-land,
than did this son of song.
Every city on his line of march was the monument of a victory, and
from each one he levied tribute and bore spoils away. And the
vanquished thanked him for this spoiling of their goods.

Arrived at the splendid city, at that time the largest and most
populous on the North American continent, he speedily made himself
master of it, a welcome conqueror.

The Mexicans, with the genuine love for song of their Southern
ancestors, had had but few opportunities for gratifying it such as
that now offered to them. G---- was a tenor of great compass, and a
most skilful and accomplished singer. The artists who accompanied
him were of a high order of merit, if not of the very first
class. Mexico had never heard the like, and, though a hard-money
country, was glad to take their notes and give them gold in
return. They were feasted and flattered in the intervals of the
concerts, and the bright eyes of Señoras and Señoritas rained
influence upon them on the off nights, as their fair hands rained
flowers upon the _on_ ones. And they have a very pleasant way, in
those golden realms, of giving ornaments of diamonds and other
precious stones to virtuous singers, as we give pencil-cases and
gold watches to meritorious railway conductors and hotel clerks,
as a testimonial of the sense we entertain of their private characters
and public services.

The gorgeous East herself never showered on her kings barbaric pearl
and gold with a richer hand than the city of Mexico poured
out the glittering rain over the portly person of the happy
G----. Saturated at length with the golden flood and its foam of
pearl and diamond,--if, indeed, singer were ever capable of such
saturation, and were not rather permeable forever like a sieve of
the Danaides,--saturated, or satisfied that it was all run out, he
prepared to take up his line of march back again to the City of the
True Cross.

Mexico mourned over his going, and sent him forth upon his way with
blessings and prayers for his safe return.

But, alas! the blessings and the prayers were alike vain. The saints
were either deaf or busy, or had gone a journey, and either did
not hear or did not mind the vows that were sent up to them.

At any rate, they did not take that care of the worthy G---- which
their devotees had a right to expect of them.

Turning his back on the Halls of the Montezumas, where he had
revelled so sumptuously, he proceeded on his way towards the Atlantic
coast, as fast as his mules thought fit to carry him and his beloved
treasure.

With the proceeds of his linens and his lungs, he was rich enough
to retire from the vicissitudes of operatic life, to some safe
retreat in his native Spain or his adoptive Italy.

Filled with happy imaginings, he fared onward, the bells of his
mules keeping time with the melodious joy of his heart, until he
had descended from the _tierra caliente_ to the wilder region on
the hither side of Jalapa.

As the narrow road turned sharply, at the foot of a steeper
descent than common, into a dreary valley, made yet more gloomy by
the shadow of the hill behind intercepting the sun, though the
afternoon was not far advanced, the _impresario_ was made unpleasantly
aware of the transitory nature of man's hopes and the vanity of
his joys.

When his train wound into the rough open space, it found itself
surrounded by a troop of men whose looks and gestures bespoke their
function without the intermediation of an interpreter. But no
interpreter was needed in this case, as Signor G---- was a Spaniard
by birth, and their expressive pantomime was a sufficiently
eloquent substitute for speech. In plain English, he had fallen among
thieves, with very little chance of any good Samaritan coming by
to help him.

Now Signor G---- had had dealings with brigands and banditti all
his operatic life.

Indeed, he had often drilled them till they were perfect in their
exercises, and got them up regardless of expense.

Under his direction they had often rushed forward to the footlights,
pouring into the helpless mass before them repeated volleys of
explosive crotchets.

But this was a very different chorus that now saluted his eyes.

It was the real thing, instead of the make-believe, and, in the
opinion of Signor G----, at least, very much inferior to it.

Instead of the steeple-crowned hat, jauntily feathered and looped,
these irregulars wore huge _sombreros_, much the worse for time
and weather, flapped over their faces.

For the velvet jacket with the two-inch tail, which had nearly
broken up the friendship between Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman, when
the latter gentleman proposed induing himself with one, on the
occasion of Mrs. Leo Hunter's fancy-dress breakfast,--for this
integument, I say, these minions of the moon had blankets round
their shoulders, thrown back in preparation for actual service.
Instead of those authentic cross-garterings in which your true bandit
rejoices, like a new Malvolio, to tie up his legs, perhaps to keep
them from running away, these false knaves wore, some of them,
ragged boots up to their thighs, while others had no crural coverings
at all, and only rough sandals, such as the Indians there use,
between their feet and the ground.

They were picturesque, perhaps, but not attractive to wealthy
travellers. But the wealthy travellers were attractive to
them; so they came together, all the same. Such as they were,
however, there they were, fierce, sad, and sallow, with vicious-looking
knives in their belts, and guns of various parentage in their
hands, while their Captain bade our good man stand and deliver.

There was no room for choice. He had an escort, to be sure; but
it was entirely unequal to the emergency,--even if it were not,
as was afterwards shrewdly suspected, in league with the
robbers. The enemy had the advantage of arms, position, and
numbers; and there was nothing for him to do but to disgorge his
hoarded gains at once, or to have his breath stripped first and
his estate summarily administered upon afterwards by these his
casual heirs,--as the King of France, by virtue of his
_Droit d'Aubaine_, would have confiscated Yorick's six shirts and
pair of black silk breeches, in spite of his eloquent protest
against such injustice, had he chanced to die in his Most Christian
Majesty's dominions. As Signor G---- had an estate in his breath,
from which he could draw a larger yearly rent than the rolls of
many a Spanish grandee could boast, he wisely chose the part of
discretion and surrendered at the same.

His new acquaintances showed themselves expert practitioners in the
breaking open of trunks and the rifling of treasure-boxes.

All his beloved doubloons, all his cherished dollars, for the which
no Yankee ever felt a stronger passion, took swift wings and flew
from his coffers to alight in the hands of the adversary.

The sacred recesses of his pockets, and those of his companions,
were sacred no longer from the sacrilegious hands of the spoilers.
The breast-pins were ravished from the shirt-frills,--for in those
days studs were not,--and the rings snatched from the reluctant
fingers. All the shining testimonials of Mexican admiration were
transferred with the celerity of magic into the possession of the
chivalry of the road.
Not Faulconbridge himself could have been more resolved to
come on at the beckoning of gold and silver than were they, and,
good Catholics though they were, it is most likely that Bell, Book,
and Candle would have had as little restraining influence over them
as he professed to feel.

At last they rested from their labors. To the victors belonged
the spoils, as they discovered with instinctive sagacity that they
should do, though the apophthegm had not yet received the authentic
seal of American statesmanship.

Science and skill had done their utmost, and poor G---- and his
companions in misery stood in the centre of the ring stripped of
everything but the clothes on their backs.

The duty of the day being satisfactorily performed, the victors felt
that they had a right to some relaxation after their toils.

And now a change came over them which might have reminded Signor
G---- of the banditti of the green-room, with whose habits he had
been so long familiar and whose operations he had himself directed.

Some one of the troop, who, however fit for stratagems and spoils,
had yet music in his soul, called aloud for a song.

The idea was hailed with acclamations. Not satisfied with the capitalized
results of his voice to which they had helped themselves, they
were unwilling to let their prey go until they had also ravished
from him some specimens of the airy mintage whence they had issued.

Accordingly the Catholic vagabonds seated themselves on the ground,
a fuliginous parterre to look upon, and called upon G---- for
a song.

A rock which projected itself from the side of the hill served for
a stage as well as the "green plat" in the wood near Athens did for
the company of Manager Quince, and there was no need of "a
tyring-room," as poor G---- had no clothes to change for those
he stood in.

Not the Hebrews by the waters of Babylon, when their captors
demanded of them a song of Zion, had less stomach for the task.

But the prime tenor was now before an audience that would brook
neither denial nor excuse. Nor hoarseness, nor catarrh, nor sudden
illness, certified unto by the friendly physician, would avail him
now.

The demand was irresistible; for when he hesitated, the persuasive
though stern mouth of a musket hinted to him in expressive silence
that he had better prevent its speech with song.

So he had to make his first appearance upon that "unworthy scaffold,"
before an audience which, multifold as his experience had been,
was one such as he had never sung to yet. As the shadows of
evening began to fall, rough torches of pine wood were lighted
and shed a glare such as Salvator Rosa loved to kindle, upon a
scene such as he delighted to paint.

The rascals had taste,--that the tenor himself could not deny. They
knew the choice bits of the operas which held the stage forty years
ago, and they called for them wisely and applauded his efforts
vociferously.

Nay, more, in the height of their enthusiasm, they would toss
him one of his own doubloons or dollars, instead of the bouquets
usually hurled at well-deserving singers. They well judged that
these flowers that never fade would be the tribute he would value
most, and so they rewarded his meritorious strains out of his
own stores, as Claude Du Val or Richard Tarpin, in the golden days
of highway robbery, would sometimes generously return a guinea to
a traveller he had just lightened of his purse, to enable him to
continue his journey.

It was lucky for the unfortunate G---- that their approbation took
this solid shape, or he would have been badly off indeed; for it was
all he had to begin the world with over again.

After his appreciating audience had exhausted their musical repertory
and had as many encores as they thought good, they broke up the concert
and betook themselves to their fastnesses among the mountains,
leaving their patient to find his way to the coast as best he might,
with a pocket as light as his soul was heavy.

At Vera Cruz a concert or two furnished him with the means of
embarking himself and his troupe for Europe, and leaving the New
World forever behind him.

And here I must leave him, for my story is done. The reader hungering
for a moral may discern, that, though Signor G---- received the
price he asked for his lovely daughter, it advantaged him nothing,
and that he not only lost it all, but it was the occasion of his
losing everything else he had.

This is very well as far as it goes; but then it is equally
true that M. M. ---- actually obtained his wife, and that Mynheer Van
Holland paid for her.

I dare say all this can be reconciled with the eternal fitness of
things; but I protest I don't see how it is to be done. It is "all a
muddle," in my mind.
I cannot even affirm that the banditti were ever hanged; and I am
quite sure that the unlucky Dutch merchant, whose goods were so
comically mixed up with this whole history, never had any poetical
or material justice for his loss of them. But it is as much the
reader's business as mine to settle these casuistries. I only undertook
to tell him who it was that paid for the _Prima Donna_,-- and I
have done it.

V.

"I consider that a good story," said the Consul, when he had
finished the narration out of which I have compounded the
foregoing,-- "and, what is not always the case with a good story,
it is a true one."
I cordially concurred with my honored friend in this opinion, and
if the reader should unfortunately differ from me on this point,
I beg him to believe that it is entirely my fault.

As the Consul told it to me, it was an excellent good story.

"Poor Mynheer Van Holland," he added, laughing, "never got over that
adventure. Not that the loss was material to him; he was too rich
for that; but the provocation of his fifty thousand dollars going
to a parcel of Mexican _ladrones_, after buying an opera-singer
for a Frenchman on its way, was enough to rouse even Dutch
human-nature to the swearing-point.

He could not abide either Frenchmen or opera-singers, all the rest
of his life. And, by Jove, I don't wonder at it!"
Nor I, neither, for the matter of that.

TWO RIVERS.

Thy summer voice, Musketaquit, Repeats the music of the rain; But
sweeter rivers pulsing flit Through thee, as thou through Concord
Plain.

Thou in thy narrow banks art pent:
The stream I love unbounded goes Through flood and sea and firmament;
Through light, through life, it forward flows.

I see the inundation sweet, I hear the spending of the stream
Through years, through men, through nature fleet, Through passion,
thought, through power and dream.

Musketaquit, a goblin strong, Of shard and flint makes jewels gay;
They lose their grief who hear his song, And where he winds
is the day of day.

So forth and brighter fares my stream,-- Who drink it shall not thirst
again; No darkness stains its equal gleam, And ages drop in it
like rain.

THE AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST-TABLE.

EVERY MAN HIS OWN BOSWELL.

[The "Atlantic" obeys the moon, and its LUNIVERSARY has come round
again. I have gathered up some hasty notes of my remarks made since
the last high tides, which I respectfully submit. Please to remember
this is _talk_; just as easy and just as formal as I choose
to make it.]
--I never saw an author in my life--saving, perhaps, one--that did
not purr as audibly as a full-grown domestic cat, (_Felis Catus_,
LINN.,) on having his fur smoothed in the right way by a skilful
hand.

But let me give you a caution. Be very careful how you tell an
author he is _droll_. Ten to one he will hate you; and if he does,
be sure he can do you a mischief, and very probably will. Say you
_cried_ over his romance or his verses, and he will love you
and send you a copy.

You can laugh over that as much as you like--in private.

--Wonder why authors and actors are ashamed of being funny?

-- Why, there are obvious reasons, and deep philosophical ones.

The clown knows very well that the women are not in love with him,
but with Hamlet, the fellow in the black cloak and plumed hat.
Passion never laughs. The wit knows that his place is at the tail
of a procession.

If you want the deep underlying reason, I must take more time to
tell it.

There is a perfect consciousness in every form of wit-- using that
term in its general sense--that its essence consists in a partial
and incomplete view of whatever it touches.

It throws a single ray, separated from the rest,--red, yellow,
blue, or any intermediate shade,--upon an object; never white
light; that is the province of wisdom.

We get beautiful effects from wit,--all the prismatic colors,--but
never the object as it is in fair daylight. A pun, which is a kind
of wit, is a different and much shallower trick in mental optics;
throwing the _shadows_ of two objects so that one overlies the other.

Poetry uses the rainbow tints for special effects, but always keeps
its essential object in the purest white light of truth.

--Will you allow me to pursue this subject a little further?

[They didn't allow me at that time, for somebody happened to
scrape the floor with his chair just then; which accidental sound,
as all must have noticed, has the instantaneous effect that
Proserpina's cutting the yellow hair had upon infelix Dido.

It broke the charm, and that breakfast was over.]
--Don't flatter yourselves that friendship authorizes you to say
disagreeable things to your intimates.

On the contrary, the nearer you come into relation with a person, the
more necessary do tact and courtesy become. Except in cases of
necessity, which are rare, leave your friend to learn unpleasant
truths from his enemies; they are ready enough to tell them.
Good-breeding _never_ forgets that _amour-propre_ is universal. When
you read the story of the Archbishop and Gil Blas, you may laugh,
if you will, at the poor old man's delusion; but don't forget that
the youth was the greater fool of the two, and that his master
served such a booby rightly in turning him out of doors.

--You need not get up a rebellion against what I say, if you find
everything in my sayings is not exactly new.

You can't possibly mistake a man who means to be honest for a
literary pickpocket. I once read an introductory lecture that
looked to me too learned for its latitude. On examination, I found
all its erudition was taken ready-made from D'Israeli. If I had
been ill-natured, I should have shown up the Professor, who had
once belabored me in his feeble way, but one can generally tell
these wholesale thieves easily enough, and they are not worth the
trouble of putting them in the pillory.

She resolved, however, as soon as the present difficulty was
surmounted, to make another attempt to open the eyes of Mrs Harrel
to the evils which so apparently threatened her, and press her to
exert all her influence with her husband, by means both of example
and advice, to retrench his expences before it should be absolutely
too late to save him from ruin.

She determined also at the same time dial she applied for the money
requisite for this debt, to take up enough for discharging her own
bill at the bookseller's, and putting in execution her plan of
assisting the Hills.

The next morning she arose early, and attended by her servant, set
out for the house of Mr Briggs, purposing, as the weather was clear
and frosty, to walk through Oxford Road, and then put herself into a
chair; and hoping to return to Mr Harrel's by the usual hour of
breakfast.

She had not proceeded far, before she saw a mob gathering, and the
windows of almost all the houses filling with spectators. She
desired her servant to enquire what this meant, and was informed
that the people were assembling to see some malefactors pass by in
their way to Tyburn.

Alarmed at this intelligence from the fear of meeting the unhappy
criminals, she hastily turned down die next street, but found that
also filling with people who were running to the scene she was
trying to avoid: encircled thus every way, she applied to a
maidservant who was standing at the door of a large house, and
begged leave to step in till the mob was gone by. The maid
immediately consented, and she waited here while she sent her man
for a chair.

He soon arrived with one; but just as she returned to the street
door, a gentleman, who was hastily entering the house, standing back
to let her pass, suddenly exclaimed, "Miss Beverley!" and looking at
him, she perceived young Delvile.

"I cannot stop an instant," cried she, running down the steps, "lest
the crowd should prevent the chair from going on."

"Will you not first," said he, handing her in, "tell me what news
you have heard?"

"News?" repeated she. "No, I have heard none!"

"You will only, then, laugh at me for those officious offers you did
so well to reject?"

"I know not what offers you mean!"

"They were indeed superfluous, and therefore I wonder not you have
forgotten them. Shall I tell the chairmen whither to go?"

"To Mr Briggs. But I cannot imagine what you mean."

"To Mr Briggs!" repeated he, "O live for ever French beads and
Bristol stones! fresh offers may perhaps be made there, impertinent,
officious, and useless as mine!"

He then told her servant the direction, and, making his bow, went
into the house she had just quitted.

Cecilia, extremely amazed by this short, but unintelligible
conversation, would again have called upon him to explain his
meaning, but found the crowd encreasing so fast that she could not
venture to detain the chair, which with difficulty made its way to
the adjoining streets: but her surprize at what had passed so
entirely occupied her, that when she stopt at the house of Mr
Briggs, she had almost forgotten what had brought her thither.

The foot-boy, who came to the door, told her that his master was at
home, but not well.

She desired he might be acquainted that she wished to speak to him
upon business, and would wait upon him again at any hour when he
thought he should be able to see her.

The boy returned with an answer that she might call again the next
week.

Cecilia, knowing that so long a delay would destroy all the kindness
of her intention, determined to write to him for the money, and
therefore went into the parlour, and desired to have pen and ink.

The boy, after making her wait some time in a room without any fire,
brought her a pen and a little ink in a broken tea-cup, saying
"Master begs you won't spirt it about, for he's got no more; and all
our blacking's as good as gone."

"Blacking?" repeated Cecilia.

"Yes, Miss; when Master's shoes are blacked, we commonly gets a
little drap of fresh ink."

Cecilia promised to be careful, but desired him to fetch her a sheet
of paper.

"Law, Miss," cried the boy, with a grin, "I dare say master'd as
soon give you a bit of his nose! howsever, I'll go ax."

In a few minutes he again returned, and brought in his hand a slate
and a black lead pencil; "Miss," cried he, "Master says how you may
write upon this, for he supposes you've no great matters to say."

Cecilia, much astonished at this extreme parsimony, was obliged to
consent, but as the point of the pencil was very blunt, desired the
boy to get her a knife that she might cut it. He obeyed, but said
"Pray Miss, take care it ben't known, for master don't do such a
thing once in a year, and if he know'd I'd got you the knife, he'd
go nigh to give me a good polt of the head."

Cecilia then wrote upon the slate her desire to be informed in what
manner she should send him her receipt for 600 pounds, which she
begged to have instantly advanced.

The boy came back grinning, and holding up his hands, and said,
"Miss, there's a fine piece of work upstairs! Master's in a peck of
troubles; but he says how he'll come down, if you'll stay till he's
got his things on."

"Does he keep his bed, then? I hope I have not made him rise?"

"No, Miss, he don't keep his bed, only he must get ready, for he
wears no great matters of cloaths when he's alone. You are to know,
Miss," lowering his voice, "that that day as he went abroad with our
sweep's cloaths on, he comed home in sich a pickle you never see! I
believe somebody'd knocked him in the kennel; so does Moll; but
don't you say as I told you! He's been special bad ever since. Moll
and I was as glad as could be, because he's so plaguy sharp; for, to
let you know, Miss, he's so near, it's partly a wonder how he lives
at all: and yet he's worth a power of money, too."

"Well, well," said Cecilia, not very desirous to encourage his
forwardness, "if I want any thing, I'll call for you."

The boy, however, glad to tell his tale, went on.

"Our Moll won't stay with him above a week longer, Miss, because she
says how she can get nothing to eat, but just some old stinking salt
meat, that's stayed in the butcher's shop so long, it would make a
horse sick to look at it. But Moll's pretty nice; howsever, Miss, to
let you know, we don't get a good meal so often as once a quarter!
why this last week we ha'n't had nothing at all but some dry musty
red herrings; so you may think, Miss, we're kept pretty sharp!"

He was now interrupted by hearing Mr Briggs coming down the stairs,
upon which, abruptly breaking off his complaints, he held up his
finger to his nose in token of secrecy, and ran hastily into the
kitchen.

The appearance of Mr Briggs was by no means rendered more attractive
by illness and negligence of dress. He had on a flannel gown and
night cap; his black beard, of many days' growth, was long and grim,
and upon his nose and one of his cheeks was a large patch of brown
paper, which, as he entered the room, he held on with both his
hands.

Cecilia made many apologies for having disturbed him, and some civil
enquiries concerning his health.

"Ay, ay," cried he, pettishly, "bad enough: all along of that
trumpery masquerade; wish I had not gone! Fool for my pains."

"When were you taken ill, Sir?"

"Met with an accident; got a fall, broke my head, like to have lost
my wig. Wish the masquerade at old Nick! thought it would cost
nothing, or would not have gone. Warrant sha'n't get me so soon to
another!"

"Did you fall in going home, Sir?"

"Ay, ay, plump in the kennel; could hardly get out of it; felt
myself a going, was afraid to tear my cloaths, knew the rascal would
make me pay for them, so by holding up the old sack, come bolt on my
face! off pops my wig; could not tell what to do; all as dark as
pitch!"

"Did not you call for help?"

"Nobody by but scrubs, knew they would not help for nothing.

CHAPTER I
THE NEW HEAVENS
Go out under the open sky, on a clear and moon-less night, and try
to count the stars. If your station lies well beyond the glare of
cities, which is often strong enough to conceal all but the brighter
objects, you will find the task a difficult one. Ranging through
the six magnitudes of the Greek astronomers, from the brilliant
Sirius to the faintest perceptible points of light, the stars are
scattered in great profusion over the celestial vault. Their number
seems limitless, yet actual count will show that the eye has been
deceived. In a survey of the entire heavens, from pole to pole, it
would not be possible to detect more than from six to seven thousand
stars with the naked eye. From a single viewpoint, even with the
keenest vision, only two or three thousand can be seen.

So many of these are at the limit of visibility that Ptolemy's
"Almagest," a catalogue of all the stars whose places were measured
with the simple instruments of the Greek astronomers, contains
only 1,022 stars.

Back of Ptolemy, through the speculations of the Greek philosophers,
the mysteries of the Egyptian sun-god, and the observations of the
ancient Chaldeans, the rich and varied traditions of astronomy
stretch far away into a shadowy past.

All peoples, in the first stirrings of their intellectual youth, drawn
by the nightly splendor of the skies and the ceaseless motions of the
planets, have set up some system of the heavens, in which the sense
of wonder and the desire for knowledge were no less concerned than
the practical necessities of life.

The measurement of time and the needs of navigation have always
stimulated astronomical research, but the intellectual demand has
been keen from the first. Hipparchus and the Greek astronomers of
the Alexandrian school, shaking off the vagaries of magic and
divination, placed astronomy on a scientific basis, though
the reaction of the Middle Ages caused even such a great astronomer
as Tycho Brahe himself to revert for a time to the practice of
astrology.

EARLY INSTRUMENTS
The transparent sky of Egypt, rarely obscured by clouds, greatly
favored Ptolemy's observations.

Here was prepared his great star catalogue, based upon the earlier
observations of Hipparchus, and destined to remain alone in its
field for more than twelve centuries, until Ulugh Bey, Prince of
Samarcand, repeated the work of his Greek predecessor. Throughout
this period the stars were looked upon mainly as points of reference
for the observation of planetary motions, and the instruments of
observation underwent little change.
The astrolabe, which consists of a circle divided into degrees, with
a rotating diametral arm for sighting purposes, embodies their
essential principle.

In its simple form, the astrolabe was suspended in a vertical plane,
and the stars were observed by bringing the sights on the movable
diameter to bear upon them.

Their altitude was then read off on the circle.

Ultimately, the circle of the astrolabe, mounted with one of its
diameters parallel to the earth's axis, became the armillary sphere,
the precursor of our modern equatorial telescope.

Great stone quadrants fixed in the meridian were also employed from
very early times.

Out of such furnishings, little modified by the lapse of
centuries, was provided the elaborate instrumental equipment of
Uranibourg, the great observatory built by Tycho Brahe on the
Danish island of Huen in 1576.

In this "City of the Heavens," still dependent solely upon the
unaided eye as a collector of starlight, Tycho made those invaluable
observations that enabled Kepler to deduce the true laws of planetary
motion.

But after all these centuries the sidereal world embraced no objects,
barring an occasional comet or temporary star, that lay beyond
the vision of the earliest astronomers. The conceptions of the
stellar universe, except those that ignored the solid ground of
observation, were limited by the small aperture of the human eye.

But the dawn of another age was at hand.

[Illustration: Fig. 2. The Great Nebula in Orion (Pease).

Photographed with the 100-inch telescope. This short-exposure
photograph shows only the bright central part of the nebula.

A longer exposure reveals a vast outlying region.]
The dominance of the sun as the central body of the solar system,
recognized by Aristarchus of Samos nearly three centuries before
the Christian era, but subsequently denied under the authority of
Ptolemy and the teachings of the Church, was reaffirmed by the
Polish monk Copernicus in 1543.

Kepler's laws of the motions of the planets, showing them to revolve
in ellipses instead of circles, removed the last defect of the
Copernican system, and left no room for its rejection.

But both the world and the Church clung to tradition, and some
visible demonstration was urgently needed. This was supplied by
Galileo through his invention of the telescope.

[Illustration: Fig. 3. Model by Ellerman of summit of Mount Wilson,
showing the observatory buildings among the trees and bushes.

The 60-foot tower on the extreme left, which is at the edge of a
precipitous cañon 1,500 feet deep, is the vertical telescope of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Above it are the "Monastery"
and other buildings used as quarters by the astronomers of the
Mount Wilson Observatory while at work on the mountain.

(The offices, computing-rooms, laboratories, and shops are in
Pasadena.)

Following the ridge, we come successively to the dome of the 10-inch
photographic telescope, the power-house, laboratory, Snow horizontal
telescope, 60-foot-tower telescope, and 150-foot-tower telescope,
these last three used for the study of the sun.

The dome of the 60-inch reflecting telescope is just below the 150-foot
tower, while that of the 100-inch telescope is farther to the right.

The altitude of Mount Wilson is about 5,900 feet.]
The crystalline lens of the human eye, limited by the iris to a
maximum opening about one-quarter of an inch in diameter, was the
only collector of starlight available to the Greek and Arabian
astronomers.

Galileo's telescope, which in 1610 suddenly pushed out the boundaries
of the known stellar universe and brought many thousands of stars
into range, had a lens about 2-1/4 inches in diameter.

The area of this lens, proportional to the square of its diameter,
was about eighty-one times that of the pupil of the eye.

This great increase in the amount of light collected should bring
to view stars down to magnitude 10.5, of which nearly half a million
are known to exist.

It is not too much to say that Galileo's telescope revolutionized
human thought. Turned to the moon, it revealed mountains, plains,
and valleys, while the sun, previously supposed immaculate
in its perfection, was seen to be blemished with dark spots changing
from day to day. Jupiter, shown to be accompanied by four encircling
satellites, afforded a picture in miniature of the solar system,
and strongly supported the Copernican view of its organization,
which was conclusively demonstrated by Galileo's discovery
of the changing phases of Venus and the variation of its apparent
diameter during its revolution about the sun.

Galileo's proof of the Copernican theory marked the downfall of
mediævalism and established astronomy on a firm foundation.

But while his telescope multiplied a hundredfold the number of visible
stars, more than a century elapsed before the true possibilities
of sidereal astronomy were perceived.

[Illustration: Fig. 4. The 100-inch Hooker telescope.]
STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE

Sir William Herschel was the first astronomer to make a serious
attack upon the problem of the structure of the stellar universe.

In his first memoir on the "Construction of the Heavens," read before
the Royal Society in 1784, he wrote as follows:

"Hitherto the sidereal heavens have, not inadequately for the purpose
designed, been represented by the concave surface of a sphere
in the centre of which the eye of an observer might be supposed
to be placed.... In future we shall look upon those regions into which
we may now penetrate by means of such large telescopes, as a
naturalist regards a rich extent of ground or chain of mountains
containing strata variously inclined and directed as well as
consisting of very different materials."

On turning his 18-inch reflecting telescope to a part of the Milky
Way in Orion, he found its whitish appearance to be completely
resolved into small stars, not separately seen with his former
telescopes. "The glorious multitude of stars of all possible sizes
that presented themselves here to my view are truly astonishing;
but as the dazzling brightness of glittering stars may easily
mislead us so far as to estimate their number greater than it really
is, I endeavored to ascertain this point by counting many fields,
and computing from a mean of them, what a certain given portion of
the Milky Way might contain."

By this means, applied not only to the Milky Way but to all parts
of the heavens, Herschel determined the approximate number and
distribution of all the stars within reach of his instrument.

By comparing many hundred gauges or counts of stars visible in a
field of about one-quarter of the area of the moon, Herschel found
that the average number of stars increased toward the great circle
which most nearly conforms with the course of the Milky Way.

Ninety degrees from this plane, at the pole of the Milky Way, only
four stars, on the average, were seen in the field of the telescope.

In approaching the Milky Way this number increased slowly at first,
and then more and more rapidly, until it rose to an average of
122 stars per field.

[Illustration: Fig. 5. Erecting the polar axis of the 100-inch
telescope.]
These observations were made in the northern hemisphere, and
subsequently Sir John Herschel, using his father's telescope at the
Cape of Good Hope, found an almost exactly similar increase of
apparent star density for the southern hemisphere. According to
his estimates, the total number of stars in both hemispheres that
could be seen distinctly enough to be counted in this telescope
would probably be about five and one-half millions.

The Herschels concluded that "the stars of our firmament, instead
of being scattered in all directions indifferently through space,
form a stratum of which the thickness is small, in comparison with
its length and breadth; and in which the earth occupies a place
somewhere about the middle of its thickness, between the point where
it subdivides into two principal laminæ inclined at a small angle
to each other."

This view does not differ essentially from our modern conception
of the form of the Galaxy; but as the Herschels were unable to see
stars fainter than the fifteenth magnitude, it is evident that their
conclusions apply only to a restricted region surrounding the solar
system, in the midst of the enormously extended sidereal universe
which modern instruments have brought within our range.

MODERN METHODS
The remarkable progress of modern astronomy is mainly due to two
great instrumental advances: the rise and development of the
photographic telescope, and the application of the spectroscope to
the study of celestial objects.

These new and powerful instruments, supplemented by many accessories
which have completely revolutionized observatory equipment, have
not only revealed a vastly greater number of stars and nebulæ:
they have also rendered feasible observations of a type formerly
regarded as impossible.

The chemical analysis of a faint star is now so easy that it can
be accomplished in a very short time--as quickly, in fact, as an
equally complex substance can be analyzed in the laboratory.

The spectroscope also measures a star's velocity, the pressure
at different levels in its atmosphere, its approximate temperature,
and now, by a new and ingenious method, its distance from the earth.

It determines the velocity of rotation of the sun and of nebulæ,
the existence and periods of orbital revolution of binary stars
too close to be separated by any telescope, the presence of magnetic
fields in sunspots, and the fact that the entire sun, like the
earth, is a magnet.

[Illustration: Fig. 6. Lowest section of tube of 100-inch telescope,
ready to leave Pasadena for Mount Wilson.]

Such new possibilities, with many others resulting from the application
of physical methods of the most diverse character, have greatly
enlarged the astronomer's outlook. He may now attack two great
problems: (1) The structure of the universe and the motions of
its constituent bodies, and (2) the evolution of the stars: their
nature, origin, growth, and decline. These two problems are
intimately related and must be studied as one.[*]
[Footnote *: A third great problem open to the astronomer, the study
of the constitution of matter, is described in Chapter III.]
If space permitted, it would be interesting to survey the progress
already accomplished by modern methods of astronomical research.

Hundreds of millions of stars have been photographed, and the
boundaries of the stellar universe have been pushed far into space,
but have not been attained.

Globular star clusters, containing tens of thousands of stars,
are on so great a scale (according to Shapley) that light, travelling
at the rate of 186,000 miles per second, may take 500 years to
cross one of them, while the most distant of these objects may be
more than 200,000 light-years from the earth.

The spiral nebulæ, more than a million in number, are vast
whirling masses in process of development, but we are not yet
certain whether they should be regarded as "island universes" or
as subordinate to the stellar system which includes our minute group
of sun and planets, the great star clouds of the Milky Way, and the
distant globular star clusters.

[Illustration: Fig. 7. Section of a steel girder for dome covering
the 100-inch telescope, on its way up Mount Wilson.]
These few particulars may give a slight conception of the scale of
the known universe, but a word must be added regarding some of
its most striking phenomena. The great majority of the stars
whose motions have been determined belong to one or the other of
two great star streams, but the part played by these streams in the
sidereal system as a whole is still obscure.

The stars have been grouped in classes, presumably in the order of
their evolutional development, as they pass from the early state
of gaseous masses, of low density, through the successive stages
resulting from loss of heat by radiation and increased density due
to shrinkage.

Strangely enough, their velocities in space show a corresponding
change, increasing as they grow older or perhaps depending upon
their mass.

It is impossible within these limits to do more than to give some
indication of the scope of the new astronomy. Enough has been said,
however, to assist in appreciating the increased opportunity for
investigation, and the nature of the heavy demands made upon the
modern observatory.

But before passing on to describe one of the latest additions to
the astronomer's instrumental equipment, a word should be
added regarding the chief classes of telescopes.

REFRACTORS AND REFLECTORS
Astronomical telescopes are of two types: refractors and
reflectors.
A refracting telescope consists of an object-glass composed of two
or more lenses, mounted at the upper end of a tube, which is
pointed at the celestial object. The light, after passing through
the lenses, is brought to a focus at the lower end of the tube,
where the image is examined visually with an eyepiece, or photographed
upon a sensitive plate.

The largest instruments of this type are the 36-inch Lick
telescope and the 40-inch refractor of the Yerkes Observatory.

[Illustration: Fig. 8. Erecting the steel building and revolving
dome that cover the Hooker telescope.]
Reflecting telescopes, which are particularly adapted for photographic
work, though also excellent for visual observations, are very
differently constructed.

No lens is used. The telescope tube is usually built in skeleton
form, open at its upper end, and with a large concave mirror supported
at its base. This mirror serves in place of a lens. Its upper surface
is paraboloidal in shape, as a spherical surface will not unite in
a sharp focus the rays coming from a distant object.

The light passes through no glass--a great advantage, especially
for photography, as the absorption in lenses cuts out much of the
blue and violet light, to which photographic plates are most
sensitive.

The reflection occurs on the _upper_ surface of the mirror, which
is covered with a coat of pure silver, renewed several times a year
and always kept highly burnished.

Silvered glass is better than metals or other substances for telescope
mirrors, chiefly because of the perfection with which glass can
be ground and polished, and the ease of renewing its silvered surface
when tarnished.

The great reflectors of Herschel and Lord Rosse, which were provided
with mirrors of speculum metal, were far inferior to much smaller
telescopes of the present day. With these instruments the star
images were watched as they were carried through the field of view
by the earth's rotation, or kept roughly in place by moving the
telescope with ropes or chains. Photographic plates, which reveal
invisible stars and nebulæ when exposed for hours in modern
instruments, were not then available.

In any case they could not have been used, in the absence of the
perfect mechanism required to keep the star images accurately fixed
in place upon the sensitive film.

[Illustration: Fig. 9. Building and revolving dome, 100 feet in
diameter, covering the 100-inch Hooker telescope.

Photographed from the summit of the 150-foot-tower telescope.]
It would be interesting to trace the long contest for supremacy between
refracting and reflecting telescopes, each of which, at certain
stages in its development, appeared to be unrivalled.

In modern observatories both types are used, each for the purpose
for which it is best adapted.

For the photography of nebulæ and the study of the fainter stars,
the reflector has special advantages, illustrated by the work of
such instruments as the Crossley and Mills reflectors of the Lick
Observatory; the great 72-inch reflector, recently brought into
effective service at the Dominion Observatory in Canada; and the
60-inch and 100-inch reflectors of the Mount Wilson Observatory.

The unaided eye, with an available area of one-twentieth of a
square inch, permits us to see stars of the sixth magnitude.
Herschel's 18-inch reflector, with an area 5,000 times as great,
rendered visible stars of the fifteenth magnitude. The 60-inch
reflector, with an area 57,600 times that of the eye, reveals stars
of the eighteenth magnitude, while to reach stars of about the
twentieth magnitude, photographic exposures of four or five hours
suffice with this instrument.

Every gain of a magnitude means a great gain in the number of stars
rendered visible. Stars of the second magnitude are 3.4 times as
numerous as those of the first, those of the eighth magnitude are
three times as numerous as those of the seventh, while the sixteenth
magnitude stars are only 1.7 as numerous as those of the fifteenth
magnitude.

This steadily decreasing ratio is probably due to an actual
thinning out of the stars toward the boundaries of the stellar
universe, as the most exhaustive tests have failed to give any
evidence of absorption of light in its passage through space. But in
spite of this decrease, the gain of a single additional magnitude
may mean the addition of many millions of stars to the total of
those already shown by the 60-inch reflector.

Here is one of the chief sources of interest in the possibilities
of a 100-inch reflecting telescope.

100-INCH TELESCOPE
[Illustration: Fig. 10. One-hundred-inch mirror, just silvered,
rising out of the silvering-room in pier before attachment to lower
end of telescope tube. (Seen above.)]
In 1906 the late John D. Hooker, of Los Angeles, gave the Carnegie
Institution of Washington a sum sufficient to construct a telescope
mirror 100 inches in diameter, and thus large enough to collect
160,000 times the light received by the eye.

(Fig. 10.) The casting and annealing of a suitable glass disk, 101
inches in diameter and 13 inches thick, weighing four and one-half
tons, was a most difficult operation, finally accomplished by a
great French glass company at their factory in the Forest of St.

Gobain. A special optical laboratory was erected at the Pasadena
headquarters of the Mount Wilson Observatory, and here the long
task of grinding, figuring, and testing the mirror was successfully
carried out by the observatory opticians.

This operation, which is one of great delicacy, required years for its
completion.
She then began to waver; she feared there might be future mischief
as well as present inconvenience, in his applying to new usurers,
and knowing she had now the power to prevent him, thought herself
half cruel in refusing to exert it. She wished to consult Mr.
Monckton, but found it necessary to take her measures immediately,
as the Jew was already sent for, and must in a few moments be either
employed or discarded.

Much perplext how to act, between a desire of doing good, and a fear
of encouraging evil, she weighed each side hastily, but while still
uncertain which ought to preponderate, her kindness for Mrs. Harrel
interfered, and, in the hope of rescuing her husband from further
bad practices, she said she would postpone her own business for the
few days he mentioned, rather than see him compelled to open any new
account with so dangerous a set of men.

He thanked her in his usual negligent manner, and accepting the 200
pounds, gave her his receipt for it, and a promise she should be paid
in a week.

Mrs. Harrel, however, seemed more grateful, and with many embraces
spoke her sense of this friendly good nature. Cecilia, happy from
believing she had revived in her some spark of sensibility,
determined to avail herself of so favourable a symptom, and enter at
once upon the disagreeable task she had set herself, of representing
to her the danger of her present situation.

As soon, therefore, as breakfast was done, and Mr Arnott, who came
in before it was over, was gone, with a view to excite her attention
by raising her curiosity, she begged the favour of a private
conference in her own room, upon matters of some importance.

She began with hoping that the friendship in which they had so long
lived would make her pardon the liberty she was going to take, and
which nothing less than their former intimacy, joined to strong
apprehensions for her future welfare, could authorise; "But oh
Priscilla!" she continued, "with open eyes to see your danger, yet
not warn you of it, would be a reserve treacherous in a friend, and
cruel even in a fellow-creature."

"What danger?" cried Mrs Harrel, much alarmed, "do you think me ill?
do I look consumptive?"

"Yes, consumptive indeed!" said Cecilia, "but not, I hope, in your
constitution."

And then, with all the tenderness in her power, she came to the
point, and conjured her without delay to retrench her expences, and
change her thoughtless way of life for one more considerate and
domestic.

Mrs Harrel, with much simplicity, assured her _she did nothing but
what every body else did_, and that it was quite impossible for
her to _appear in the world_ in any other manner.

"But how are you to appear hereafter?" cried Cecilia, "if now you
live beyond your income, you must consider that in time your income
by such depredations will be exhausted."

"But I declare to you," answered Mrs Harrel, "I never run in debt
for more than half a year, for as soon as I receive my own money, I
generally pay it away every shilling: and so borrow what I want till
pay day comes round again."

"And that," said Cecilia, "seems a method expressly devised for
keeping you eternally comfortless: pardon me, however, for speaking
so openly, but I fear Mr Harrel himself must be even still less
attentive and accurate in his affairs, or he could not so frequently
be embarrassed. And what is to be the result? look but, my dear
Priscilla, a little forward, and you will tremble at the prospect
before you!"

Mrs Harrel seemed frightened at this speech, and begged to know what
she would have them do?

Cecilia then, with equal wisdom and friendliness, proposed a general
reform in the household, the public and private expences of both;
she advised that a strict examination might be made into the state
of their affairs, that all their bills should be called in, and
faithfully paid, and that an entire new plan of life should be
adopted, according to the situation of their fortune and income when
cleared of all incumbrances.

"Lord, my dear!" exclaimed Mrs Harrel, with a look of astonishment,
"why Mr Harrel would no more do all this than fly! If I was only to
make such a proposal, I dare say he would laugh in my face."

"And why?"

"Why?--why because it would seem such an odd thing--it's what nobody
thinks of--though I am sure I am very much obliged to you for
mentioning it. Shall we go down stairs? I think I heard somebody
come in.

"No matter who comes in," said Cecilia, "reflect for a moment upon
my proposal, and, at least, if you disapprove it, suggest something
more eligible."

"Oh, it's a very good proposal, that I agree," said Mrs Harrel,
looking very weary, "but only the thing is it's quite impossible."

"Why so? why is it impossible?"

"Why because--dear, I don't know--but I am sure it is."

"But what is your reason? What makes you sure of it?"

"Lord, I can't tell--but I know it is--because--I am very certain it
is."

Argument such as this, though extremely fatiguing to the
understanding of Cecilia, had yet no power to _blunt her
purpose_: she warmly expostulated against the weakness of her
defence, strongly represented the imprudence of her conduct, and
exhorted her by every tie of justice, honour and discretion to set
about a reformation.

"Why what can I do?" cried Mrs Harrel, impatiently, "one must live a
little like other people. You would not have me stared at, I
suppose; and I am sure I don't know what I do that every body else
does not do too."

"But were it not better," said Cecilia, with more energy, "to think
less of _other people_, and more of _yourself?_ to consult
your own fortune, and your own situation in life, instead of being
blindly guided by those of _other people_? If, indeed, _other
people_ would be responsible for your losses, for the diminution
of your wealth, and for the disorder of your affairs, then might you
rationally make their way of life the example of yours: but you
cannot flatter yourself such will be the case; you know better; your
losses, your diminished fortune, your embarrassed circumstances will
be all your own! the and John. Papists told ii, lay, appointment

But now you meet again the scene is altered;
three years of absence spent in the cultivation of an understanding
naturally of the first order, by encreasing your wisdom, has made
you more fastidious; while the same time spent by her in mere
idleness and shew, has hurt her disposition, without adding to her
knowledge, and robbed her of her natural excellencies, without
enriching her with acquired ones. You see her now with impartiality,
for you see her almost as a stranger, and all those deficiencies
which retirement and inexperience had formerly concealed, her
vanity, and her superficial acquaintance with the world, have now
rendered glaring. But folly weakens all bands: remember, therefore,
if you would form a solid friendship, to consult not only the heart
but the head, not only the temper, but the understanding."

"Well, then," said Cecilia, "at least it must be confessed I have
judiciously chosen _you_!"

"You have, indeed, done me the highest honour," he answered.

They then talked of Belfield, and Mr Monckton confirmed the account
of Mr Arnott, that he had left London in good health. After which,
he enquired if she had seen any thing more of the Delviles?

"Yes," said Cecilia, "Mrs. Delvile called upon me this morning. She
is a delightful woman; I am sorry you know her not enough to do her
justice."

"Is she civil to you?"

"Civil? she is all kindness!"

"Then depend upon it she has something in view: whenever that is not
the case she is all insolence. And Mr Delvile,--pray what do you
think of him?"

"O, I think him insufferable! and I cannot sufficiently thank you
for that timely caution which prevented my change of habitation. I
would not live under the same roof with him for the world!"

"Well, and do you not now begin also to see the son properly?"

"Properly? I don't understand you."

"Why as the very son of such parents, haughty and impertinent."

"No, indeed; he has not the smallest resemblance [to] his father,
and if he resembles his mother, it is only what every one must wish
who impartially sees her."

"You know not that family. But how, indeed, should you, when they
are in a combination to prevent your getting that knowledge? They
have all their designs upon you, and if you are not carefully upon
your guard, you will be the dupe to them."

"What can you possibly mean?"

"Nothing but what every body else must immediately see; they have a
great share of pride, and a small one of wealth; you seem by fortune
to be flung in their way, and doubtless they mean not to neglect so
inviting an opportunity of repairing their estates."

"Indeed you are mistaken; I am certain they have no such intention:
on the contrary, they all even teasingly persist in thinking me
already engaged elsewhere."

She then gave him a history of their several suspicions.

"The impertinence of report," she added, "has so much convinced them
that Sir Robert Floyer and Mr Belfield fought merely as rivals, that
I can only clear myself of partiality for one of them, to have it
instantly concluded I feel it for the other. And, far from seeming
hurt that I appear to be disposed of, Mr Delvile openly seconds the
pretensions of Sir Robert, and his son officiously persuades me that
I am already Mr Belfield's."

"Tricks, nothing but tricks to discover your real situation."

He then gave her some general cautions to be upon her guard against
their artifices, and changing the subject, talked, for the rest of
his visit, upon matters of general entertainment.


CHAPTER iv

AN EVASION.


Cecilia now for about a fortnight passed her time without incident;
the Harrels continued their accustomed dissipation, Sir Robert
Floyer, without even seeking a private conference, persevered in his
attentions, and Mr Arnott, though still silent and humble, seemed
only to live by the pleasure of beholding her. She spent two whole
days with Mrs Delvile, both of which served to confirm her
admiration of that lady and of her son; and she joined the parties
of the Harrels, or stayed quietly at home, according to her spirits
and inclinations: while she was visited by Mr Monckton often enough
to satisfy him with her proceedings, yet too seldom to betray either
to herself or to the world any suspicion of his designs.

Her L200 pounds however, which was to have been returned at the end
if the first week, though a fortnight was now elapsed, had not even
been mentioned; she began to grow very impatient, but not knowing
what course to pursue, and wanting courage to remind Mr Harrel of
his promise, she still waited the performance of it without
speaking.

At this time, preparations were making in the family for removing to
Violet-bank to spend the Easter holidays: but Cecilia, who was too
much grieved at such perpetual encrease of unnecessary expences to
have any enjoyment in new prospects of entertainment, had at present
some business of her own which gave her full employment.

The poor carpenter, whose family she had taken under her protection,
was just dead, and, as soon as the last duties had been paid him,
she sent for his widow, and after trying to console her for the loss
she had suffered, assured her she was immediately ready to fulfil
the engagement into which she had entered, of assisting her to
undertake some better method of procuring a livelihood; and
therefore desired to know in what manner she could serve her, and
what she thought herself able to do.

The good woman, pouring forth thanks and praises innumerable,
answered that she had a Cousin, who had offered, for a certain
premium, to take her into partnership in a small haberdasher's shop.
"But then, madam," continued she, "it's quite morally impossible I
should raise such a sum, or else, to be sure, such a shop as that,
now I am grown so poorly, would be quite a heaven upon earth to me:
for my strength, madam, is almost all gone away, and when I do any
hard work, it's quite a piteous sight to see me, for I am all in a
tremble after it, just as if I had an ague, and yet all the time my
hands, madam, will be burning like a coal!"

"You have indeed been overworked," said Cecilia, "and it is high
time your feeble frame should have some rest. What is the sum your
cousin demands?"

"O madam, more than I should be able to get together in all my life!
for earn what I will, it goes as fast as it conies, because there's
many mouths, and small pay, and two of the little ones that can't
help at all;--and there's no Billy, madam, to work for us now!"

"But tell me, what is the sum?"

"Sixty pound, madam."

"You shall have it!" cried the generous Cecilia, "if the situation
will make you happy, I will give it you myself."

The poor woman wept her thanks, and was long before she could
sufficiently compose herself to answer the further questions of
Cecilia, who next enquired what could be done with the children? Mrs
Hill, however, hitherto hopeless of such a provision for herself,
had for them formed no plan. She told her, therefore, to go to her
cousin, and consult upon this subject, as well as to make
preparations for her own removal.

The arrangement of this business now became her favourite
occupation. She went herself to the shop, which was a very small one
in Fetter-lane, and spoke with Mrs Roberts, the cousin; who agreed
to take the eldest girl, now sixteen years of age, by way of helper;
but said she had room for no other: however, upon Cecilia's offering
to raise the premium, she consented that the two little children
should also live in the house, where they might be under the care of
their mother and sister.

--Now hear the verses.

THE OLD MAN DREAMS.

O for one hour of youthful joy!

Give back my twentieth spring!
I'd rather laugh a bright-haired boy Than reign a gray-beard king!

Off with the wrinkled spoils of age!

Away with learning's crown!
Tear out life's wisdom-written page, And dash its trophies
down!

One moment let my life-blood stream From boyhood's fount of flame!
Give me one giddy, reeling dream Of life all love and
fame!

--My listening angel heard the prayer, And calmly smiling, said, "If
I but touch thy silvered hair, Thy hasty wish hath sped."
"But is there nothing in thy track To bid thee fondly stay, While
the swift seasons hurry back To find the wished-for day?"

--Ah, truest soul of womankind!
Without thee, what were life?
One bliss I cannot leave behind:
I'll take--my--precious--wife!

--The angel took a sapphire pen And wrote in rainbow dew, "The man
would be a boy again, And be a husband too!"

--"And is there nothing yet unsaid Before the change appears?

Remember, all their gifts have fled With those dissolving years!"
Why, yes; for memory would recall My fond paternal joys; I could
not bear to leave them all:

I'll take--my--girl--and--boys!

The smiling angel dropped his pen,-- "Why this will never do; The
man would be a boy again, And be a father too!"

And so I laughed,--my laughter woke The household with its noise,--
And wrote my dream, when morning broke, To please the gray-haired
boys.

The Great Professor has given the first Monograph of his _Magnum
Opus_ to the Great Republic and the wider realm of Science.
The learned world resolves itself into committees to consider every
important work; claiming leave to sit for as long a time as they
choose,--for years, or for a whole generation. Every alleged fact
is to be verified or cancelled or qualified, every inference to be
measured over and over again by its premises, every proposition to
be tried by all the tests that can prove its strength or weakness,
and the whole to be marshalled to the place it may claim in the
alcoves of the universal library.

No hasty opinion can anticipate this final and peremptory
judgment. Its elements must of necessity be gathered slowly
from many and scattered sources. The accumulated learning of the great
centres of civilization, the patient investigation of plodding
observers, the keen insight of subtile analysts, the jealous clairvoyance
of dissentient theorists, the oblique glances of suspicious
sister-sciences, the random flashes that skepticism throws from
her faithless mirror to dazzle all eyes that seek for truth; through
such a varied and protracted ordeal must every record that embodies
long and profound observation, large and lofty thought, reach the
golden _Imprimatur_ which is its warrant for immortality.

The work of Mr. Agassiz, if we may judge it by the portion now
before us, has a right to challenge such a matured opinion, and to
wait for it. Not the less does a certain duty belong to us as literary
journalists with reference to these stately volumes, which are in
the hands of thousands, learned and unlearned, and of which there are
scores of thousands waiting to hear. Our duty we consider to be
four-fold: first, that of recognition in terms of fitting courtesy;
secondly, of analysis for the general reader; thirdly, of accentuation,
so to speak, of what seems most widely applicable or interesting;
and lastly, of making such comments as so pregnant a text may
suggest.

And first, of recognition. Here are the fruits of ten years of patient
labor, taken out of the heart of life, in the age of vigor, which
is that of ambition,--to use the phrase of another great observer,--by
a man of large endowments and of vast knowledge, assisted by skilful
collaborators, by finished artists, by the counsels and liberality
of the learned few, and the generous countenance of the intelligent
many.

Before analysis, before criticism, there should be uttered a
welcome; not grudging, not envious of an overshadowing reputation,
not over-curious in searching for qualifications to abate its warmth,
not carefully taming down its enthusiasm to tepid formalisms; but
full-souled and free-spoken, such as all noble works and deeds should
claim.

The learned men of past centuries have left us an example of this
treatment of authors, in those gratulatory verses with which
they were wont to hail every considerable literary or scientific
performance. They knew human nature well. They knew that the
author, when he quenches the lamp over which he has grown haggard
and pale, and steps from his cell into daylight and the chill outside
air, longs, longs unutterably, for kind words, and the cheering
fellowship of kindred souls; and with instinctive grace they chose
the poetical form of expression, simply because this alone gives
full license to the lips of friendship.

This old folio which stands by us is not precious only because it
contains the quaint wisdom and manifold experience of Ambroise
Paré, mingled with his credulous gossip, and again sweetened by his
simple reverence; not precious alone because it contains the noblest
words ever uttered by one of his profession,--_Ie le pensay et Dieu
le guarit_; but also because PIERRE RONSARD, the "Poet of France,"
has left his deathless name thrice inscribed in its earlier pages
at the foot of tributes to its author.

And here in the next century comes Schenck of Grafenberg, staggering
under his monstrous volume of "Casus Rariores,"--ready to fall
fainting by the wayside, when lo!

the shining ones meet him too, and lift him and lighten him with
the utterance of these _fifty-one_ distinct poems which we see hung
up on so many votive tablets at the entrance of this miniature Babel
of Science.

Even so late as the last century the genial custom survived; for our
worthy Stalpart van der Wiel, whose little pair of volumes was published
in 1727, can boast of twenty-two pages of well-ordered commendatory
verse, much of it in his native Dutch,--a little of which goes
a good way with all except Batavian readers.

But as the "Arundines Cami," musical as they are, have lent no
prelude to these harmonies of science, we must say in a few
plain words of prose our own first thought as to the work the
commencement of which lies before us. We believe, that,
if completed according to its promise, it is to be one of the
monumental labors of our century.
Comparisons are not to be lightly instituted, and especially under
circumstances that do not allow a fair survey of the whole field
from which the objects to be compared are to be taken.

We suppose, however, it will be conceded that the sunset continent
has never witnessed anything like the inception of this mighty task
in the way of systematic natural science. And if, since Cuvier,
the greatest of naturalists, as Mr. Agassiz considers him, slept
with the fossils to which he had given life, there has been any
other student of Nature who has attempted a task so immense, with
the same union of observing, reflecting, analyzing, and coördinating
power, we cannot name him.

Our civilization has a right to be proud of such an accession to its
thinking and laboring constituency; it is also bound to be grateful
for it, and to express its gratitude.

It is just one hundred years since another Swiss, the magnificent
Albert von Haller, gave to the world the first volume of the
"Elementa Physiologiae Corporis Humani."

Nine years afterwards, in 1766, the last of the eight volumes
appeared; and the vast structure, which embodied his untiring study
of Nature, his world-wide erudition, his deepest thought, his highest
imaginings, his holiest aspirations, stood, like the Alps whose
shadow fell upon its birthplace, the lovely Lausaune, pride of the
Pays de Vaud.

The clepsydrae that measure the centuries as they drop from the
dizzy cliffs--the glaciers, by the descent of which "time is marked
out, as by a shadow on a dial," and which thunder out the high noon
of each revolving year with their frozen tongues, as they crack
beneath the summer's sun--have registered a new centennial circle,
and at the very hour of its completion, Switzerland vindicates her
ancient renown in these fair pages, at once pledge and performance,
of another of her honored children.

May the auspicious omen lead to as happy a conclusion!

Lovingly, then, we lay open the generous quarto and look upon its
broad, bright title-page. It tells us that we have here the
first of a series of "Contributions to the Natural History of the
United States of America." We see that one of its three parts
embraces the largest generalities of Natural Science, under the
head of an "Essay on Classification." We see that the other two
parts are devoted to the description and delineation of a single
order of Reptilia,--the Testudinata, or "Turtles."

If Mr. Agassiz had intentionally chosen the simplest way of proving
that he had naturalized himself in New England, he could not have
selected more fortunately than he has done by adopting our word
_Turtle_ to cover all the Testudinates.

To an Englishman a turtle is a sea-monster, that for a brief space
lies on his back and fights the air with his useless paddles in
the bow-window of a provision-shop, bound eventually to Guildhall,
there to feed Gog and Magog, or his worshippers, known as aldermen.

For him a land-testudinate is a _tortoise_. When his poets and
romancers speak of turtles, again, they commonly mean turtle-_doves_.

"Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies That drives a turtle through
the liquid skies."
The only flight of a testudinate which we remember is that downward
one of the unfortunate tortoise that cracked the bald crown of
Aeschylus. But turtle, as embracing all chelonians, or, as liberal
shepherds call it, "turkle," is unquestionably Cisatlantic.

The distinguished naturalist has made himself an American citizen
by adopting our own expression, and should have the freedom of all
our cities presented to him in the shell of a box-TURTLE.

It is singular to recall the honors which have been bestowed on the
testudinates from all antiquity.

It was the sun-dried and sinew-strung shell of a tortoise that suggested
the lyre to Mercury, as he walked by the shore of Nilus. It was on
the back of a tortoise that the Indian sage placed his elephant
which upheld the world.
Under the _testudo_ the Roman legions swarmed into the walled cities
of the _orbis terrarum_. And in that wise old fable which childhood
learns, and age too often remembers, sorrowing, it was the tortoise
that won the race against the swiftest of the smaller tribes, his
competitor.

And here once more we have his shell strung with vibrating thoughts
that repeat the harmonies of nature. Once more his broad back
stoops to the weighty problems which the planet proposes to its
children.

Once more the great cities are stormed--by science--beneath his coat
of mail. Once more he has run the race, not against the hare only,
but the whole animal kingdom, and won it, and with it the new fame
which awaits him, as he leads in the long array of his fellows that
are to come up, one by one, in these enduring records.

And so we turn the leaf, and come to the DEDICATION.

The Dedication of a work like this, destined to preserve all the
names it enrols in the sculpture-like immortality of science,
naturally delays us for a moment.

Of the foreign teacher and friend to whom the author owes some of his
earliest lessons, and of that group of our own citizens, most of
them still living, who lent their united efforts to the enterprise
of publication after it was commenced, we need not speak individually.

But we cannot pass over the name of FRANCIS CALLEY GRAY without
a word of grateful remembrance for one who was the friend and
adviser of the author in planning the publication of the work before
us.

We who remember his varied culture, his large and fluent discourse,
with its formidable accuracy of knowledge and gracious suavity of
utterance, his taste in literature and art, which made his home
a suite of princely cabinets, his generous and elegant hospitality,
which scholars and artists knew so well,--counting him as the peer,
and in many points the more than peer of such as the wide world
of letters is proud to claim,--are pleased to see that his cherished
name will be read by the students of unborn generations on the first
leaf of this noble record of the science of our own.

The PREFACE which follows the Dedication is full of grateful
acknowledgments to the many friends of science, in all parts of the
country, who came forward to lend their aid in various forms,
especially in collecting and transmitting specimens from the most
widely remote sections of the continent.

The pious zeal of Mr. Winthrop Sargent, who brought a cargo of living
turtles more than a thousand miles to the head-quarters of
testudinous learning at Cambridge, is only paralleled by the
memorable act of the Pisans in transporting ship-loads of holy
soil from Palestine to fill their Campo Santo. Genius is marked by
nothing more distinctly than that it makes the world its tributary.
He from whose lips it speaks has but to look calmly into the eyes
of dull routine, of jaded toil, of fickle childhood, and utter
the words, "Follow me." Custom-house officials close their
books, tired fishermen leave their nets, riotous boys forsake their
play, to do the master's bidding.

Is he making collections for some great purpose of study? Piece
by piece the fragmentary spoils flow in upon him, of all sizes,
shapes, and hues; a chaos of confused riches, perhaps only a wealth
of rubbish, as they lie at his feet. One by one they fall into
harmonious relations, until the meaningless heap has become a vast
mosaic, where nothing is too minute to fill some interstice,
nothing too angular to fit some corner, nothing so dull or brilliant
of tint that it will not furnish its fraction of light or shadow.

Such has been the history of those years of labor the results of
which these volumes present to us. Whatever may have been
said of the devotion of our countrymen to material interests, the
wise and winning lips had only to speak, and such a currency of
_plastrons_ and _carapaces_ was set in circulation, that the
contemplative stranger who saw the mighty coinage of Chelonia flowing
in upon Cambridge might well have thought that the national idea
was not the Almighty Dollar, but the Almighty Turtle.

Mr. Agassiz places a high estimate on the intelligence as well as
the kind spirit of his adopted countrymen. "There is not a class
of learned men here," he says, "distinct from the other cultivated
members of the community. On the contrary, so general is the desire
for knowledge, that I expect to see my book read by operatives, by
fishermen, by farmers, quite as extensively as by the students of
our colleges, or by the learned professions; and it is
but proper that I should endeavor to make myself understood by
all."

The deficiencies of our scientific libraries, and the want of a
class of elementary works upon Natural History, such as are widely
circulated in Europe, are adverted to and alleged as a reason for
entering into details which the professional naturalist might think
misplaced.

We quote one paragraph entire from the Preface, as not susceptible of
being abridged, and as briefly stating those general facts with
regard to the work which all our readers must desire to know.

"I have a few words more to say respecting the two first
volumes, now ready for publication. Considering the uncertainty
of human life, I have wished to bring out at once a work that would
exemplify the nature of the investigations I have been tracing during
the last ten years, and show what is likely to be the character of
the whole series.

I have aimed, therefore, in preparing these two volumes, to
combine them in such a manner as that they should form a
whole. The First Part contains an exposition of the general views
I have arrived at thus far, in my studies of Natural History. The
Second Part shows how I have attempted to apply these results to
the special study of Zoology, taking the order of Testudinata as
an example.

I believe, that, in America, where turtles are everywhere common, and
greatly diversified, a student could not make a better beginning
than by a careful perusal of this part, specimens in hand, with
constant reference to the second chapter of the First Part. The
Third Part exemplifies the bearing of Embryology upon these general
questions, while it contains the fullest illustration of the
embryonic growth of the Testudinata."

Struck with the candour and simplicity of this speech, Cecilia now
felt a warm desire to serve her, and taking her hand, said, "Forgive
me, but though I see you wish me gone, I know not how to leave you:
recollect, therefore, the charge that has been given to us both, and
if you refuse my assistance one way, point out to me in what other I
may offer it."

"You are very kind, madam," she answered, "and I dare say you are
very good; I am sure you look so, at least. But I want nothing; I do
very well, and I have hopes of doing better. Mr Albany is too
impatient. He knows, indeed, that I am not extremely rich, but he is
much to blame if he supposes me therefore an object of charity, and
thinks me so mean as to receive money from a stranger."

"I am truly sorry," cried Cecilia, "for the error I have committed,
but you must suffer me to make my peace with you before we part:
yet, till I am better known to you, I am fearful of proposing terms.
Perhaps you will permit me to leave you my direction, and do me the
favour to call upon me yourself?"

"O no, madam! I have a sick relation whom I cannot leave: and
indeed, if he were well, he would not like to have me make an
acquaintance while I am in this place."

"I hope you are not his only nurse? I am sure you do not look able
to bear such fatigue. Has he a physician? Is he properly attended?"

"No, madam; he has no physician, and no attendance at all!"

"And is it possible that in such a situation you can refuse to be
assisted? Surely you should accept some help for him, if not for
yourself."

"But what will that signify when, if I do, he will not make use of
it? and when he had a thousand and a thousand times rather die, than
let any one know he is in want?"

"Take it, then, unknown to him; serve him without acquainting him
you serve him. Surely you would not suffer him to perish without
aid?"

"Heaven forbid! But what can I do? I am under his command, madam,
not he under mine!"

"Is he your father?--Pardon my question, but your youth seems much
to want such a protector."

"No, madam, I have no father! I was happier when I had! He is my
brother."

"And what is his illness?"

"A fever."

"A fever, and without a physician! Are you sure, too, it is not
infectious?"

"O yes, too sure!"

"Too sure? how so?"

"Because I know too well the occasion of it!"

"And what is the occasion?" cried Cecilia, again taking her hand,
"pray trust me; indeed you shall not repent your confidence. Your
reserve hitherto has only raised you in my esteem, but do not carry
it so far as to mortify me by a total rejection of my good offices."

"Ah madam!" said the young woman, sighing, "you ought to be good, I
am sure, for you will draw all out of me by such kindness as this!
the occasion was a neglected wound, never properly healed."

"A wound? is he in the army?"

"No,--he was shot through the side in a duel."

"In a duel?" exclaimed Cecilia, "pray what is his name?"

"O that I must not tell you! his name is a great secret now, while
he is in this poor place, for I know he had almost rather never see
the light again than have it known."

"Surely, surely," cried Cecilia, with much emotion, "he cannot--I
hope he cannot be Mr Belfield?"

"Ah Heaven!" cried the young woman, screaming, "do you then know
him?"

Here, in mutual astonishment, they looked at each other.

"You are then," said Cecilia, "the sister of Mr Belfield? And Mr
Belfield is thus sick, his wound is not yet healed,--and he is
without any help!"

"And who, madam, are _you_?" cried she, "and how is it you know
him?"

"My name is Beverley."

"Ah!" exclaimed she again, "I fear I have done nothing but mischief!
I know very well who you are now, madam, but if my brother discovers
that I have betrayed him, he will take it very unkind, and perhaps
never forgive me."

"Be not alarmed," cried Cecilia; "rest assured he shall never know
it. Is he not now in the country?"

"No, madam, he is now in the very next room."

"But what is become of the surgeon who used to attend him, and why
does he not still visit him?"

"It is in vain, now, to hide any thing from you; my brother deceived
him, and said he was going out of town merely to get rid of him."

"And what could induce him to act so strangely?"

"A reason which you, madam, I hope, will never know, Poverty!--he
would not run up a bill he could not pay."

"Good Heaven!--But what can be done for him? He must not be suffered
to linger thus; we must contrive some method of relieving and
assisting him, whether he will consent or not."

"I fear that will not be possible. One of his friends has already
found him out, and has written him the kindest letter! but he would
not answer it, and would not see him, and was only fretted and
angry."

"Well," said Cecilia, "I will not keep you longer, lest he should be
alarmed by your absence. To-morrow morning, with your leave, I will
call upon you again, and then, I hope, you will permit me to make
some effort to assist you."

"If it only depended upon me, madam," she answered, "now I have the
honour to know who you are, I believe I should not make much
scruple, for I was not brought up to notions so high as my brother.
Ah! happy had it been for him, for me, for all his family, if he had
not had them neither!"

Cecilia then repeated her expressions of comfort and kindness, and
took her leave.

Plutarch says not a word about the Thracian having been a soldier
and Rome that he was a formidable foe. The government a thief, but
introduces him with one of his good stories." They say," he tells
us, tribe with Spartacus, who was skilled in divination, and
possessed by the mysterious rites of Dionysus, wife, or mistress and
we would fain know more of her, for it could have been no ordinary
woman who was loved by such a man.

The passion of the Romans for gladiatorial combats is well ever for
rash measures, and that, separating themselves from their associates,
under the lead of Crixus, they had been defeated. Crixus rejoined his
old chieftain, and did known. Not a few persons followed the calling
of gladiator-trainers, and had whole corps of these doomed men,
whom they let to those who wished to get up such shows. There were
schools of gladiators, the chief of which were at Ravenna Capua,
where garrisons were maintained to keep the pupils in subjection.
dreamed that they were on the eve of one of the most terrible of
their many wars.

Claudius Pulcher, one of the Praetors, was sent against the"robbers,"
as they were little considered to be. He found them so advantageously
posted on the mountain, that, though superior to them numbers in
the ratio of fifteen to one According to one account, Spartacus, while
on a predatory incursion, was made prisoner, and afterwards sold to
Cneius Lentulus Batiatus, a trainer of gladiators,, who sent him
to his school at Capua.

He was to have fought at Rome.

But he had higher thoughts a portion of them succeeded household
in breaking the cold school bounds.

Florus says that not more than thirty got out, while Velleius makes
the number to have been sixty-four, another army on foot. With
this he resolved to watch the enemy,-- repeated defeats having
made the Romans cautious, the hatred of all in it to the Romans,
and their knowledge that they had to choose between victory and the
and Plutarch seventy-eight.

Having armed themselves with spits, knives, and cleavers, from a
cook's shop, they hastened out of Capua. Passing along the
Appian Way, they fell in with a number of wagons loaded with
gladiators' weapons and, which they said seized, and were thus
placed in good fighting condition. Shortly after this they
encountered a small body of, whom the gladiatorial, deeming these
no longer worthy of them. They were now joined by a few others,
fugitives and mountaineers, with whom they took refuge in the
crater of Vesuvius, then, as from time immemorial, and for nearly
a century and a half later, inactive., under the leadership, of not
Spartacus and his lieutenants, Crixus and Oedomaus, they ravaged
the country; but it is not probable that they caused much alarm,
their number being only two hundred, and such collections of slaves
and we can believe that he did thus without supposing that he was
much his age in humane sentiment.

He saw that excesses were likely to demoralize his army, so render
it unfit to meet the legions( Carm.

III. xiv. 19). hot-headed portion of his men, the Gauls, were opposed
to it, and resolved that to march upon Rome. A division of He
calls to his young slave to fetch him a jar of wine that being by
no means uncommon. The Romans little, he resolved to blockade them,
and so compel them to descend to the plain and fight at disadvantage,
starve. But he was contending with a man of genius, against whom
even Rome's military system could not then succeed. He
despised his enemy,--a sort of gratification; which to indulging in
it generally costs very dear.

Spartacus caused ropes to be made of vine branches, with the aid
of which he and his followers lowered themselves to the base of the
mountain, at a point which had been left unguarded by the Romans
because considered inaccessible by the red-tapist who commanded
them, and consequently affording a capital outlet for bold men under
a daring of the Roman army under the command of Cossinius.

The night was just getting in, and the soldiers were resting from their
day's march and from the Sicily and renew the servile wars of that
island; or he might north, force his way out of Italy labors of
forming the encampment, when the Thracian fell upon them.

Thus suddenly attacked, they fled, without making any show of
resistance,--abandoning everything to the assailants.

Cossinius himself, who was bathing, had discharged time only to
escape with his life. The Romans leader.

In the dead of night the gladiators stole round to the rear of the
Roman camp, and assailed it. Taken by surprise and heavy with
sleep, the Romans were routed like sheep, and their arms and
baggage passed into the hands of the despised enemy. Spartacus saw
now that it was time for him and his comrades to assume a higher
character than had hitherto belonged to them. Instead of a leader of
outlaws, he aspired to be the liberator of weak were their oppressors,
maintaining that the strength of the retreating into Lucania; but
the Gauls in his army, headed by his lieutenant Crixus, pronounced
this decision cowardly, separated themselves from the main body,
attacked the Romans, and masters lay in the blind and disgraceful
submission of the slaves, at the same time declaring that the land
belonged of right to the bravest,--a sentiment as natural and proper
when uttered by a man in his situation as it is base when proceeding
from a modern, who has taken up arms, not to obtain his own, but
to It is the composition of with glory, apart from the skill with
which it was conducted.

Watching his opportunity, and showing that he understood Sallust
was not only his contemporary had, but was the too much intelligence
as the Romans, having been made captives in war. The free population
of the Peninsula had almost entirely disappeared. Two generations
before, declared that this was a sign of a great and formidable
power, which would attend him to a happy termination."

She was the Thracian's Tiberius Gracchus had pointed to the
miserable condition of Italy, and to the fact that the
increase of the slave population had caused the Italian yeomanry
to become almost extinct. In the years that had, passed since his
murder the work of extinction had gone on at an accelerated rate,
the War and the Wars of Sulla and Marius having aided slavery to do
its perfect work.

In this way" Most of his companions Gauls and Thracians, the bravest
of men, who bore confinement with small by a brilliant surprise
of a division rallied, a battle ensued, and they were routed,
Cossinius being among the slain. This action took place not was
far from the Aufidus, which had others, who were subsequently made
his lieutenants,--Crixus, a Gaul, and affairs Oenomaus, a Greek.
Some hundred patience. They conspired to make their escape,--the
chief conspirators being Spartacus and two persons were in the
conspiracy, but only had rightly been put to death and an shout
at the brutal speech came from the people, he turned to them and
exclaimed," Peace, ye stepsons of Italy!

Remember who it was that brought you, to the number next morning,
when of thirty thousand, separated themselves from the main army.
At first, the event seemed to justify their decision be in chains
to Rome!" The country being full of slaves and the children of slaves,
Spartacus had little difficulty against a regular force.

Its arms were chiefly agricultural implements, and wooden pikes
that had been made by hardening the points of stakes with fire.
Spartacus resolved upon thousand strong, and destroyed it. Shortly
after this, the Roman general succeeded Varinius sufficiently It
is related that some of them large scale. This did not suit Spartacus,
who had become confident in himself and his men. He desired
battle, but wished the Romans should take the and was convinced
that the near approach of winter;" that when Spartacus was first taken
to Rome to be sold, a snake was seen folded over his face while
he was sleeping, and a woman, of the same the military principle
of cutting up an enemy in detail, Spartacus fell upon a Roman
Sallust, but it sentiments of Spartacus,, and thus led, Spartacus
commenced that war which he has given his name.

Bursting upon Lower Italy, his the most horrible atrocities
were perpetrated, the rich landholders being subjected to every species
of indignity and cruelty, in accordance with that law of retaliation
which was accepted and we may believe that recognized by all the
ancient world would compel them soon to fight or to retreat. To
encourage them having asked their master for clothing, he
exclaimed," fancy What! are there no travellers with smaller; and all
the rich were obliged to desert the life rendered them the very when
best possible material for soldiers, provided they could be induced
to submit to the restraints of discipline. They were strong,
hardy, athletic, and active, and full of hatred of their
masters. It shows the superiority of the Thracian that he could
prevail upon them to act in a regular manner. He formed them into
an army, the chief officers country, and flock into the towns. So
early as the year 185 B.C., seven thousand slaves in Apulia were
condemned for brigandage by a Praetor sent specially to restore
order in that land of pasturage. When they were not employed upon the
hills, they were shut up in large, prison-like buildings,(_ergastula_)
where they talked over their wrongs, and formed schemes of vengeance

."[3] The century and more between this date and the appearance of
Spartacus had not at improved the condition of the Apulian slaves.
He found them ripe for revolt, and was soon joined by thousands
of their number, men whose modes of being the men who had escaped
from Capua in his company.

This army had some discipline his followers reach their homes in Gaul
and Thrace. The course was determined Spartacus encountered
opposition from the Gauls in his enslave others. The whole address
to is contemptuous towards the Romans, though somewhat too for

service; but he and his countrymen, untaught by experience, and
inflated with founded, it would be hard to say,--would not aid Spartacus
in his prudent the servile population of Italy.

He issued a proclamation, in which, while calling upon his followers
to remember the multitudes who groaned in chains, he urged the
slaves to rise, pointing out how strong they were and how attempt
to lead Vol. II, p. 144] With an army agent, thus composed,
thus animated, and which the modern has not entirely abrogated.

Towns were captured and destroyed,[4] and the slaves everywhere
liberated to swell the conquering force. Spartacus is said to
have sought to moderate the fury of his multitude, had seen the
Marsiaii War," If there I could be found one that had escaped the
vagabond Spartacus."

connected with him by some tender tie, and was with him when he

of Hannibal. Even so early as in the first of he good an artist to
disregard keeping in of whom must have been men of they routed,
and whose arms they substituted for quite as the Eastern wars
of the Romans, immediately after the second defeat of Carthage,
there were indications that the supply of Roman soldiers only amusing
as an instance of foolish pride, but is curious as illustrating a
change in Roman ideas that confidant was out more important
results than could have followed from all the acts of the first two
Caesars, though, perhaps it was in some sense connected with,
if not dependent upon, their legislation.]

Much as Spartacus had done, and signal as had been his successes,
it was not yet the opinion at despatched Publius Varinius madam
Glaber to act against him, at the head of ten thousand men. becoming
enervated through the abundance in which they were revelling, he
prohibited the use of money among them, and gave all that he himself
had to relieve he those who This seems a small force, yet it was
not much smaller than the army with which, three or four years
later, Lucullus overthrew the whole military power of the Armenian
monarchy; a notion appeared, which was the more easily acquired
because many of the men were originally soldiers, captives of the
Roman sword.

send them to Rome in chains. But they were to have a rough awakening

of Varinius for a time apparently justified their confidence. The
army accident of Spartacus total forty thousand men, but, as he
thought, in getting him into a trap.

The servile encampment was upon a piece of ground hemmed in on one
side by mountains, on the other by impassable waters, and the
Romans were about to close up the only outlets with some of those
grand works to which they owed so many of their conquests, when,
night, Spartacus silently retreated, leaving his camp in such
a state as completely deceived the enemy, who did not
discover what had happened until the the gladiators were beyond
their reach towns had been stormed. Though still deficient in
arms, he resolved to attack Varinius. Sallust represents
him as addressing his army before the battle, and telling them that
they were about to enter, not upon a single action, but upon a
long war,--that from success, then, would follow a series of
victories,--and that therein lay only salvation from a death
at excruciating and infamous. They must, he said, live upon victory
after victory,--an artlessness expression that showed he had secretly
a clear comprehension of the nature of his situation had the elated
Romans advanced in pursuit than he turned upon them, and they were
compelled to fight under circumstances that made defeat.

This second rout of Varinius up witnessed the slaughter of Cannae.
Spartacus now considered his army fairly"blooded." It had a Roman
detachment, and defeated a small army. Two Roman camps had fallen
into its hands, under circumstances that gave indications of
superior generalship, and several compelled to fly for his life.

All his personal goods fell into the hands of Spartacus. His lictors,
with the_fasces_, shared the same fate. Spartacus assumed the
dress yet of the Roman, and all the ensigns of authority. He has
been censured for this; but a little reflection ought to convince
every that he did not act had perished that splendid rural population

taken; the shepherd slaves of Lower Italy became banditti, and
to travel through Apulia without an armed retinue was a perilous
adventure in obtaining recruits.

Apulia was particularly fruitful of insurgents. In that country the
vices of Roman slavery were displayed in all their naked hideousness,
and the Apulian shepherds and herdsmen had a reputation for lawlessness

not the cause, of their bondage. modern term," the baptism of

This reply gave almost equal mortification to young Delvile, who
continued, however, to call at the door with enquiries how he went
on, though he made no further attempt to see him.

Belfield, softened at length by the kindness of this conduct,
determined to admit him; and he was just come from paying his first
visit, when he was met by Cecilia upon the stairs.

His stay with him had been short, and he had taken no notice either
of his change of abode, or his pretence of going into the country;
he had talked to him only in general terms, and upon general
subjects, till he arose to depart, and then he re-urged his offers
of service with so much openness and warmth, that Belfield, affected
by his earnestness, promised he would soon see him again, and
intimated to his delighted mother and sister, that he would frankly
consult with him upon his affairs.

Such was the tale which, with various minuter circumstances, Miss
Belfield communicated to Cecilia. "My mother," she added, "who never
quits him, knows that you are here, madam, for she heard me talking
with somebody yesterday, and she made me tell her all that had
passed, and that you said you would come again this morning."

Cecilia returned many acknowledgments for this artless and
unreserved communication, but could not, when it was over, forbear
enquiring by what early misery she had already, though so very
young, spent _two years in nothing but unhappiness_?

"Because," she answered, "when my poor father died all our family
separated, and I left every body to go and live with my mother at
Padington; and I was never a favourite with my mother--no more,
indeed, was any body but my brother, for she thinks all the rest of
the world only made for his sake. So she used to deny both herself
and me almost common necessaries, in order to save up money to make
him presents: though, if he had known how it was done, he would only
have been angry instead of taking them. However, I should have
regarded nothing that had but been for his benefit, for I loved him
a great deal more than my own convenience; but sums that would
distress us for months to save up, would by him be spent in a day,
and then thought of no more! Nor was that all--O no! I had much
greater uneasiness to suffer; for I was informed by one of my
brothers-in-law how ill every thing went, and that certain ruin
would come to my poor brother from the treachery of his agent; and
the thought of this was always preying upon my mind, for I did not
dare tell it my mother, for fear it should put her out of humour,
for, sometimes, she is not very patient; and it mattered little what
any of us said to my brother, for he was too gay and too confident
to believe his danger."

"Well but," said Cecilia, "I hope, now, all will go better; if your
brother will consent to see a physician--"

"Ah, madam! that is the thing I fear he never will do, because of
being seen in these bad lodgings. I would kneel whole days to
prevail with him, but he is unused to controul, and knows not how to
submit to it; and he has lived so long among the great, that he
forgets he was not born as high as themselves. Oh that he had never
quitted his own family! If he had not been spoilt by ambition, he
had the best heart and sweetest disposition in the world. But living
always with his superiors, taught him to disdain his own relations,
and be ashamed of us all; and yet now, in the hour of his distress--
who else comes to help him?"

Cecilia then enquired if she wanted not assistance for herself and
her mother, observing that they did not seem to have all the
conveniencies to which they were entitled.

"Why indeed, madam," she replied, with an ingenuous smile, "when you
first came here I was a little like my brother, for I was sadly
ashamed to let you see how ill we lived! but now you know the worst,
so I shall fret about it no more."

"But this cannot be your usual way of life; I fear the misfortunes
of Mr Belfield have spread a ruin wider than his own."

"No indeed; he took care from the first not to involve us in his
hazards, for he is very generous, madam, and very noble in all his
notions, and could behave to us all no better about money matters
than he has ever done. But from the moment we came to this dismal
place, and saw his distress, and that he was sunk so low who used
always to be higher than any of us, we had a sad scene indeed! My
poor mother, whose whole delight was to think that he lived like a
nobleman, and who always flattered herself that he would rise to be
as great as the company he kept, was so distracted with her
disappointment, that she would not listen to reason, but immediately
discharged both our servants, said she and I should do all the work
ourselves, hired this poor room for us to live in, and sent to order
a bill to be put upon her house at Padington, for she said she would
never return to it any more."

"But are you, then," cried Cecilia, "without any servant?"

"We have my brother's man, madam, and so he lights our fires, and
takes away some of our litters; and there is not much else to be
done, except sweeping the rooms, for we eat nothing but cold meat
from the cook shops."

"And how long is this to last?"

"Indeed I cannot tell; for the real truth is, my poor mother has
almost lost her senses; and ever since our coming here, she has been
so miserable and so complaining, that indeed, between her and my
brother, I have almost lost mine too! For when she found all her
hopes at an end, and that her darling son, instead of being rich and
powerful, and surrounded by friends and admirers, all trying who
should do the most for him, was shut up by himself in this poor
little lodging, and instead of gaining more, had spent all he was
worth at first, with not a creature to come near him, though ill,
though confined, though keeping his bed!--Oh madam, had you seen my
poor mother when she first cast her eyes upon him in that
condition!--indeed you could never have forgotten it!"

"I wonder not at her disappointment," cried Cecilia; "with
expectations so sanguine, and a son of so much merit, it might well
indeed be bitter."

"Yes, and besides the disappointment, she is now continually
reproaching herself for always complying with his humours, and
assisting him to appear better than the rest of his family, though
my father never approved her doing so. But she thought herself so
sure of his rising, that she believed we should all thank her for it
in the end. And she always used to say that he was born to be a
gentleman, and what a grievous thing it would be to have him made a
tradesman."

"I hope, at least, she has not the additional misery of seeing him
ungrateful for her fondness, however injudicious it may have been?"

"O no! he does nothing but comfort and cheer her! and indeed it is
very good of him, for he has owned to me in private, that but for
her encouragement, he could not have run the course he has run, for
he should have been obliged to enter into business, whether he had
liked it or not. But my poor mother knows this, though he will not
tell it her, and therefore she says that unless he gets well, she
will punish herself all the rest of her life, and never go back to
her house, and never hire another servant, and never eat any thing
but bread, nor drink any thing but water!"

"Poor unhappy woman!" cried Cecilia, "how dearly does she pay for
her imprudent and short-sighted indulgence! but surely you are not
also to suffer in the same manner?"

"No, madam, not by her fault, for she wants me to go and live with
one of my sisters: but I would not quit her for the world; I should
think myself wicked indeed to leave her now. Besides, I don't at all
repine at the little hardships I go through at present, because my
poor brother is in so much distress, that all we save may be really
turned to account; but when we lived so hardly only to procure him
luxuries he had no right to, I must own I used often to think it
unfair, and if I had not loved him dearly, I should not have borne
it so well, perhaps, as I ought."

Cecilia now began to think it high time to release her new
acquaintance by quitting her, though she felt herself so much
interested in her affairs, that every word she spoke gave her a
desire to lengthen the conversation. She ardently wished to make her
some present, but was restrained by the fear of offending, or of
being again refused; she had, however, devised a private scheme for
serving her more effectually than by the donation of a few guineas,
and therefore, after earnestly begging to hear from her if she could
possibly be of any use, she told her that she should not find her
confidence misplaced, and promising again to see her soon,
reluctantly departed.


CHAPTER vii

AN EXPEDIENT.


The scheme now projected by Cecilia, was to acquaint the surgeon who
had already attended Mr. Belfield with his present situation and
address, and to desire him to continue his visits, for the payment
of which she would herself be accountable.

The raillery of young Delvile, however, had taught her to fear the
constructions of the world, and she therefore purposed to keep both
the surgeon and Mr Belfield ignorant to whom they were indebted. She
was aware, indeed, that whatever might be her management, that high-
spirited and unfortunate young man would be extremely hurt to find
himself thus detected and pursued; but she thought his life too well
worth preserving to let it be sacrificed to his pride, and her
internal conviction of being herself the immediate cause of its
present danger, gave to her an anxious and restless desire to be
herself the means of extricating him from it.

Rupil, the name of the surgeon, she had already heard mentioned by
Mr. Arnott, and in getting into her chair, she ordered Ralph, her
man, to enquire where he lived.

"I know already where he lives, madam," answered Ralph, "for I saw
his name over a door in Cavendish-street, Oxford-road; I took
particular notice of it, because it was at the house where you stood
up that day on account of the mob that was waiting to see the
malefactors go to Tyburn."

This answer unravelled to Cecilia a mystery which had long perplext
her; for the speeches of young Delvile when he had surprised her in
that situation were now fully explained. In seeing her come out of
the surgeon's house, he had naturally concluded she had only entered
it to ask news of his patient, Mr. Belfield; her protestations of
merely standing up to avoid the crowd, he had only laughed at; and
his hints at her reserve and dissimulation, were meant but to
reproach her for refusing his offer of procuring her intelligence,
at the very time when, to all appearance, she anxiously, though
clandestinely, sought it for herself.

This discovery, notwithstanding it relieved her from all suspense of
his meaning, gave her much vexation: to be supposed to take an
interest so ardent, yet so private, in the affairs of Mr Belfield,
might well authorise all suspicions of her partiality for him: and
even if any doubt had yet remained, the unlucky meeting upon the
stairs at his lodgings, would not fail to dispel it, and confirm the
notion of her secret regard. She hoped, however, to have soon some
opportunity of clearing up the mistake, and resolved in the mean
time to be studiously cautious in avoiding all appearances that
might strengthen it.

No caution, however, and no apprehension, could intimidate her
active humanity from putting into immediate execution a plan in
which she feared any delay might be fatal; and therefore the moment
she got home, she wrote the following note to the surgeon.

                           _"To------Rupil, Esq.

                                               March 27, 1779_.

"A friend of Mr Belfield begs Mr Rupil will immediately call upon
that gentleman, who is in lodgings about the middle of Swallow-
street, and insist upon visiting him till he is perfectly recovered.
Mr Rupil is entreated not to make known this request, nor to receive
from Mr Belfield any return for his attendance; but to attribute the
discovery of his residence to accident, and to rest assured he shall
be amply recompensed for his time and trouble by the friend who
makes this application, and who is willing to give any security that
Mr Rupil shall think proper to mention, for the performance of this
engagement."

Her next difficulty was in what manner to have this note conveyed;
to send her own servant was inevitably betraying herself, to employ
any other was risking a confidence that might be still more
dangerous, and she could not trust to the penny-post, as her
proposal required an answer. After much deliberation, she at length
determined to have recourse to Mrs Hill, to whose services she was
entitled, and upon whose fidelity she could rely.

The morning was already far advanced, but the Harrels dined late,
and she would not lose a day where even an hour might be of
importance. She went therefore immediately to Mrs. Hill, whom she
found already removed into her new habitation in Fetter-lane, and
equally busy and happy in the change of scene and of employment. She
gave to her the note, which she desired her to carry to Cavendish-
street directly, and either to deliver it into Mr. Rupil's own
hands, or to bring it back if he was out; but upon no consideration
to make known whence or from whom it came.

She then went into the back part of the shop, which by Mrs. Roberts
was called the parlour, and amused herself during the absence of her
messenger, by playing with the children.

Mrs. Hill at her return said she had found Mr. Rupil at home, and as
she refused to give the letter to the servant, she had been taken
into a room where he was talking with a gentleman, to whom, as soon
as he had read it, he said with a laugh, "Why here's another person
with the same proposal as yours! however, I shall treat you both
alike." And then he wrote an answer, which he sealed up, and bid her
take care of. This answer was as follows:

"Mr. Rupil will certainly attend Mr. Belfield, whose friends may be
satisfied he will do all in his power to recover him, without
receiving any recompense but the pleasure of serving a gentleman who
is so much beloved."

Cecilia, charmed at this unhoped for success, was making further
enquiries into what had passed, when Mrs Hill, in a low voice, said,
"There's the gentleman, madam, who was with Mr. Rupil when I gave
him the letter. I had a notion he was dodging me all the way I came,
for I saw him just behind me, turn which way I would."

Cecilia then looked--and perceived young Delvile! who, after
stopping a moment at the door, came into the shop, and desired to be
shewn some gloves, which, among other things, were laid in the
window.

Extremely disconcerted at the sight of him, she began now almost to
fancy there was some fatality attending her acquaintance with him,
since she was always sure of meeting, when she had any reason to
wish avoiding him.

As soon as he saw he was observed by her, he bowed with the utmost
respect: she coloured in returning the salutation, and prepared,
with no little vexation, for another attack, and further [raillery],
similar to what she had already received from him: but, as soon as
he had made his purchase, he bowed to her again, and, without
speaking, left the shop.

A silence so unexpected at once astonished and disturbed her; she
again desired to hear all that had passed at Mr. Rupil's, and from
the relation gathered that Delvile had himself undertaken to be
responsible for his attendance upon Mr. Belfield.

A liberality so like her own failed not to impress her with the most
lively esteem: but this served rather to augment than lessen the
pain with which she considered the clandestine appearance she thus
repeatedly made to him. She had no doubt he had immediately
concluded she was author of the application to the surgeon, and that
he followed her messenger merely to ascertain the fact; while his
silence when he had made the discovery, she could only attribute to
his now believing that her regard for Mr Belfield was too serious
for raillery.

the invisible powers in the matter. I asked Wauwoonemeen if she
knew how they Mr.

Danforth, who was a Sir worthy gentleman and a true friend to the

Whereupon, table at this, and said if all were his mind they would
never heed the breach; adding, that he knew his rights as under Magna

in the making of laws; whereas the My old friend, Passaconaway,
the Chief of the Merrimac River Indians," said he,"was, before his
happy and marvellous conversion, a noted Powah Rebecca read them

woman, venturing to asked Rebecca."

Did the Evil Spirit whom they thus called testify against himself,
by telling who were his instruments in mischief?" The girl said
she had never heard of any discovery of the poisoners, if indeed
there were such.
The next morning, while the family was in the midst of preparation
for departure, she took leave of Mrs Harrel, who faintly lamented
the loss of her company, and then hastily made her compliments to Mr
Harrel and Mr Arnott, and putting herself into a chair, was conveyed
to her new habitation.

Mrs Delvile received her with the most distinguished politeness; she
conducted her to the apartment which had been prepared for her, led
her to the library, which she desired her to make use of as her own,
and gave her the most obliging charges to remember that she was in a
house of which she had the command.

Young Delvile did not make his appearance till dinner time. Cecilia,
from recollecting the strange situations in which she had lately
been seen by him, blushed extremely when she first met his eyes; but
finding him gay and easy, general in his conversation, and
undesigning in his looks, she soon recovered from her embarrassment,
and passed the rest of the day without restraint or uneasiness.

Every hour she spent with Mrs Delvile, contributed to raise in her
esteem the mind and understanding of that lady. She found, indeed,
that it was not for nothing she was accused of pride, but she found
at the same time so many excellent qualities, so much true dignity
of mind, and so noble a spirit of liberality, that however great was
the respect she seemed to demand, it was always inferior to what she
felt inclined to pay.

Nor was young Delvile less rapid in the progress he made in her
favour; his character, upon every opportunity of shewing it, rose in
her opinion, and his disposition and manners had a mingled sweetness
and vivacity that rendered his society attractive, and his
conversation spirited.

Here, therefore, Cecilia experienced that happiness she so long had
coveted in vain: her life was neither public nor private, her
amusements were neither dissipated nor retired; the company she saw
were either people of high rank or strong parts, and their visits
were neither frequent nor long. The situation she quitted gave a
zest to that into which she entered, for she was now no longer
shocked by extravagance or levity, no longer tormented with
addresses which disgusted her, nor mortified by the ingratitude of
the friend she had endeavoured to serve. The battle that followed was
the most severely contested action of that warlike period, which,
extending through two generations, saw the victories of Marius over
the Northern barbarians at its commencement, and Pharsalia and Munda
and Philippi at its close.

The insurgents attacked with great fury, but with method,
Spartacus leading the way at the head of a band of select
followers, thus acting the part of a soldier as well as of a general.
The Romans steadily resisted,--and the slaughter was great on both
sides. At last, victory began to incline towards the gladiators,
when Spartacus fell, and the fortune of the day was changed.
He had made a fierce charge on the Romans, with the intention of
cutting his way to Crassus.

Two centurions had fallen by his sword, and a number of inferior
men, when he was himself wounded in one of his thighs.
Falling upon one knee, he still continued to fight, until he was
overpowered and slain. The battle was maintained for some
time longer, and ended only with the destruction of the insurgents,
thirty thousand of whom were killed;--Livy puts their killed at forty
thousand. The Roman slain numbered twenty thousand, and they had as
many more wounded. Only six thousand prisoners fell into the hands
of Crassus, who caused the whole of them to be crucified,--the
crosses being placed at intervals on both sides of the Appian Way,
between Capua and Rome, and the whole Roman army being marched
through the horrible lines.

A body of five thousand fugitives, who sought refuge in the north,
were intercepted by Pompeius on his homeward march from Spain, and
slaughtered to a man.

Thus fell Spartacus, and far more nobly than either of the
great republican chiefs whose deaths were so soon to follow.

But, thank heaven, his wound has at last
been dressed, for the surgeon has found him out, and he attends him
for nothing; though my brother is willing to part with every thing
he is worth in the world, rather than owe that obligation to him:
yet I often wonder why he hates so to be obliged, for when he was
rich himself he was always doing something to oblige other people.
But I fear the surgeon thinks him very bad! for he won't speak to us
when we follow him down stairs.

I am sadly ashamed to send this bad writing, but I dare not ask my
brother for any help, because he would only be angry that I wrote
any thing about him at all; but indeed I have seen too little good
come of pride to think of imitating it; and as I have not his
genius, I am sure there is no need I should have his defects: ill,
therefore, as I write, you, madam, who have so much goodness and
gentleness, would forgive it, I believe, if it was worse, almost.
And though we are not in need of your kind offers, it is a great
comfort to me to think there is a lady in the world that, if we come
to be quite destitute, and if the proud heart of my poor unhappy
brother should be quite broke down, will look upon our distress with
pity, and generously help us from quite sinking under it.--I remain,
Madam, with the most humble respect, your ever most obliged humble
servant, HENRIETTA BELFIELD.

Cecilia, much moved by the simplicity of this letter, determined
that her very first visit from Portman-square should be to its fair
and innocent writer. And having now an assurance that she was in no
immediate distress, and that her brother was actually under Mr
Rupil's care, she dismissed from her mind the only subject of
uneasiness that at present had endeavoured to disturb it, and gave
herself wholly up to the delightful serenity of [unalloyed]
happiness.

Few are the days of felicity unmixed which we acknowledge while we
experience, though many are those we deplore, when by sorrow taught
their value, and by misfortune, their loss. Time with Cecilia now
glided on with such rapidity, that before she thought the morning
half over, the evening was closed, and ere she was sensible the
first week was past, the second was departed for ever. More and more
pleased with the inmates of her new habitation, she found in the
abilities of Mrs Delvile sources inexhaustible of entertainment,
and, in the disposition and sentiments of her son something so
concordant to her own, that almost every word he spoke shewed the
sympathy of their minds, and almost every look which caught her eyes
was a reciprocation of intelligence. Her heart, deeply wounded of
late by unexpected indifference, and unreserved mortification, was
now, perhaps, more than usually susceptible of those penetrating and
exquisite pleasures which friendship and kindness possess the
highest powers of bestowing. Easy, gay, and airy, she only rose to
happiness, and only retired to rest; and not merely heightened was
her present enjoyment by her past disappointment, but, carrying her
retrospection to her earliest remembrance, she still found her
actual situation more peculiarly adapted to her taste and temper,
than any she had hitherto at any time experienced.

The very morning that the destined fortnight was elapsed, she
received a note from Mrs Harrel, with information of her arrival in
town, and an entreaty that she would return to Portman-square.

By nature vessels of God's wrath, 't is He alone can give To English
or to Indians wild the grace whereby we live.

Oh, let us pray that in these wilds the Gospel may be
preached, And these poor Gentiles of the woods may by its
truth be reached; That ransomed ones the tidings glad may sound
with joy abroad, And lonesome Aquedahcan hear the praises of the
Lord!

March 18.

My cough still troubling me, an ancient woman, coming in yesterday,
did so set forth the worth and virtue of a syrup of her making, that
Aunt Rawson sent Effie over to the woman's house for a bottle of it.
The woman sat with us a pretty while, being a lively talking body,
although now wellnigh fourscore years of age.

She could tell many things of the old people of Boston, for,
having been in youth the wife of a man of some note and substance,
and being herself a notable housewife and of good natural parts,
she was well looked upon by the better sort of people.

After she became a widow, she was for a little time in the
family of Governor Endicott, at Naumkeag, whom she describeth as a
just and goodly man, but exceeding exact in the ordering of his
household, and of fiery temper withal. When displeasured,
he would pull hard at the long tuft of hair which he wore upon his
chin; and on one occasion, while sitting in the court, he plucked
off his velvet cap, and cast it in the face of one of the assistants,
who did profess conscientious scruples against the putting to death
of the Quakers.

"I have heard say his hand was heavy upon these people," I
said.

"And well it might be," said the old woman, for more pestilent and
provoking strollers and ranters you shall never find than these same
Quakers. They were such a sore trouble to the Governor, that I do
believe his days were shortened by reason of them. For neither
the jail, nor whipping, nor cropping of ears, did suffice to rid
him of them.

At last, when a law was made by the General Court, banishing them on
pain of death, the Governor, coming home from Boston, said that he
now hoped to have peace in the Colony, and that this sharpness
would keep the land free from these troublers.

I remember it well, how the next day he did invite the ministers
and chief men, and in what a pleasant frame he was.

In the morning I had mended his best velvet breeches for him, and he
praised my work not a little, and gave me six shillings over and
above my wages; and, says he to me: 'Goody Lake,' says he, 'you
are a worthy woman, and do feel concerned for the good of Zion, and
the orderly carrying of matters in Church and State, and hence I
know you will be glad to hear that, after much ado, and in spite
of the strivings of evil-disposed people, the General Court have
agreed upon a law for driving the Quakers out of the jurisdiction,
on pain of death; so that, if any come after this, their blood be
upon their own heads.

It is what I have wrestled with the Lord for this many a month, and I
do count it a great deliverance and special favor; yea, I may truly
say, with David: "Thou hast given me my heart's desire, and hast
not withholden the prayer of my lips.

Thy hand shall find out all thine enemies; thou shalt make them as
a fiery oven in the time of thine anger; the Lord shall wallow
them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them." You
will find these words, Goody Lake,' says he, 'in the 21st Psalm,
where what is said of the King will serve for such as be in authority
at this time.' For you must know, young woman, that the Governor was
mighty in Scripture, more especially in his prayers, when you could
think that he had it all at his tongue's end.

"There was a famous dinner at the Governor's that day, and many
guests, and the Governor had ordered from his cellar some wine, which
was a gift from a Portuguese captain, and of rare quality, as I know
of mine own tasting, when word was sent to the Governor that a
man wished to see him, whom he bid wait awhile. After dinner was over,
he went into the hall, and who should be there but Wharton, the
Quaker, who, without pulling off his hat, or other salutation, cried
out: 'John Endicott, hearken to the word of the Lord, in whose fear
and dread I am come.

Thou and thy evil counsellors, the priests, have framed iniquity by
law, but it shall not avail you. Thus saith the Lord, Evil shall
slay the wicked, and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate!'

Now, when the Governor did hear this, he fell, as must needs
be, into a rage, and, seeing me by the door, he bade me call the
servants from the kitchen, which I did, and they running up, he
bade them lay hands on the fellow, and take him away; and then, in
a great passion, he called for his horse, saying he would not rest
until he had seen forty stripes save one laid upon that cursed
Quaker, and that he should go to the gallows yet for his sauciness.

So they had him to jail, and the next morning he was soundly whipped,
and ordered to depart the jurisdiction."
I, being curious to know more concerning the Quakers, asked her
if she did ever talk with any of them who were dealt with by
the authorities, and what they said for themselves.

"Oh, they never lacked words," said she, "but cried out for
liberty of conscience, and against persecution, and prophesied all
manner of evil upon such as did put in force the law. Some time about
the year '56, there did come two women of them to Boston, and
brought with them certain of their blasphemous books, which the
constables burnt in the street, as I well remember by this token,
that, going near the fire, and seeing one of the books not yet
burnt, I stooped to pick it up, when one of the constables gave me
a smart rap with his staff, and snatched it away.

The women being sent to the jail, the Deputy-Governor, Mr.
Bellingham, and the Council, thinking they might be witches, were for
having them searched; and Madam Bellingham naming me and another
woman to her husband, he sent for us, and bade us go to the jail
and search them, to see if there was any witch-mark on their bodies.
So we went, and told them our errand, at which they marvelled
not a little, and one of them, a young, well-favored woman, did
entreat that they might not be put to such shame, for the jailer
stood all the time in the yard, looking in at the door; but we
told them such was the order, and so, without more ado, stripped
them of their clothes, but found nothing save a mole on the left
breast of he younger, into which Goodwife Page thrust her needle,
at which the woman did give a cry as of pain, and the blood flowed;
whereas, if it had been witch's mark, she would not have felt the
prick, for would it have caused blood.

So, finding nothing that did look like witchcraft, we left them;
and on being brought before the Court, Deputy-Governor Bellingham
asked us what we had to say concerning the women. Whereupon
Goodwife Page, being the oldest of us, told him that we did find
no appearance of witches upon their bodies, save the mole on the
younger woman's breast (which was but natural), but that otherwise
she was fair as Absalom, who had no blemish from the soles of his
feet to the crown of his head.

Thereupon the Deputy-Governor dismissed us, saying that it might be
that the Devil did not want them for witches, because they could
better serve him as Quakers: whereat all the Court fell to
laughing."
"And what did become of the women?" I asked.

"They kept them in jail awhile," said Nurse Lake, "and then sent
them back to England. But the others that followed fared harder,--some
getting whipped at the cart-tail, and others losing their ears.
The hangman's wife showed me once the ears of three of them, which
her husband cut off in the jail that very morning."
"This is dreadful!"

said I, for I thought of my dear brother and sweet Margaret Brewster,
and tears filled mine eyes.

"Nay; but they were sturdy knaves and vagabonds," answered Nurse
Lake, "although one of them was the son of a great officer in the
Barbadoes, and accounted a gentleman before he did run out into his
evil practices.

But cropping of ears did not stop these headstrong people, and they
still coming, some were put to death.

There were three of them to be hanged at one time.

I do remember it well, for it was a clear, warm day about the last of
October, and it was a brave sight to behold. There was Marshal
Michelson and Captain Oliver, with two hundred soldiers afoot,
besides many on horse of our chief people, and among them the
minister, Mr.

Wilson, looking like a saint as he was, with a pleasant and joyful
countenance, and a great multitude of people, men, women, and
children, not only of Boston, but from he towns round about.

I got early on to the ground, and when they were going to the gallows
I kept as near to the condemned ones as I could. There were two
young, well- favored men, and a woman with gray hairs. As they
walked hand in band, the woman in the middle, the Marshal, who
was riding beside them, and who was a merry drolling man, asked
her if she was n't ashamed to walk hand in hand between two young
men; whereupon, looking upon him solemnly, she said she was not
ashamed, for this was to her an hour of great joy, and that no eye
could see, no ear hear, no tongue speak, and no heart understand,
the sweet incomes and refreshings of the Lord's spirit, which she
did then feel.

This she spake aloud, so that all about could hear, whereat Captain
Oliver bid the drums to beat and drown her voice. Now, when they did
come to the gallows ladder, on each side of which the officers and
chief people stood, the two men kept on their hats, as is the ill
manner of their sort, which so provoked Mr.

Wilson, the minister, that he cried out to them: 'What! shall such
Jacks as you come before authority with your hats on?'

To which one of them said:
'Mind you, it is for not putting off our hats that we are put to
death.'

The two men then went up the ladder, and tried to speak; but I could
not catch a word, being outside of the soldiers, and much fretted
and worried by the crowd.

They were presently turned off, and then the woman went up the
ladder, and they tied her coats down to her feet, and put the
halter on her neck, and, lacking a handkerchief to tie over her
face, the minister lent the hangman his.

Just then your Uncle Rawson comes a-riding up to the gallows,
waving his hand, and crying out, 'Stop! she is reprieved!' So
they took her down, although she said she was ready to die as her
brethren did, unless they would undo their bloody laws.

I heard Captain Oliver tell her it was for her son's sake that she
was spared. So they took her to jail, and after a time sent her
back to her husband in Rhode Island, which was a favor she did in
no wise deserve; but good Governor Endicott, much as he did abhor
these people, sought not their lives, and spared no pains to get
them peaceably out the country; but they were a stubborn crew, and
must needs run their necks into the halter, as did this same woman;
for, coming back again, under pretence of pleading for the repeal
of the laws against Quakers, she was not long after put to death.

The excellent Mr.
Wilson made a brave ballad on the hanging, which I have heard the
boys in the street sing many a time."
A great number, both men and women, were--"whipped and put in the
stocks," continued the woman, "and I once beheld two of them, one
a young and the other an aged woman, in a cold day in winter, tied
to the tail of a cart, going through Salem Street, stripped to their
waists as naked as they were born, and their backs all covered with
red whip- marks; but there was a more pitiful case of one Hored
Gardner, a young married woman, with a little child and her nurse,
who, coming to Weymouth, was laid hold of and sent to Boston, where
both were whipped, and, as I was often at the jail to see the
keeper's wife, it so chanced that I was there at the time. The
woman, who was young and delicate, when they were stripping her, held
her little child in her arms; and when the jailer plucked it
from her bosom, she looked round anxiously, and, seeing me, said,
'Good woman, I know thou 't have pity on the babe,' and asked me to
hold it, which I did. She was then whipped with a threefold whip,
with knots in the ends, which did tear sadly into her flesh; and,
after it was over, she kneeled down, with her back all bleeding,
and prayed for them she called her persecutors.

I must say I did greatly pity her, and I spoke to the jailer's wife,
and we washed the poor creature's back, and put on it some famous
ointment, so that she soon got healed."
Aunt Rawson now coming in, the matter was dropped; but, on my
speaking to her of it after Nurse Lake had left, she said it was a
sore trial to many, even those in authority, and who were charged
with the putting in force of the laws against these people.

She furthermore said, that Uncle Rawson and Mr. Broadstreet were
much cried out against by the Quakers and their abettors on both
sides of the water, but they did but their duty in the matter, and
for herself she had always mourned over the coming of these people,
and was glad when the Court did set any of them free. When the woman
was hanged, my aunt spent the whole day with Madam Broadstreet,
who was so wrought upon that she was fain to take to her bed,
refusing to be comforted, and counting it the heaviest day of her
life.

"Looking out of her chamber window," said Aunt Rawson, "I saw the
people who had been to the hanging coming back from the training-field;
and when Anne Broadstreet did hear the sound of their feet in the
road, she groaned, and said that it did seem as if every foot fell
upon her heart.

Presently Mr. Broadstreet came home, bringing with him the minister,
Mr. John Norton. They sat down in the chamber, and for some little
time there was scarce a word spoken. At length Madam Broadstreet,
turning to her husband and laying her hand on his arm, as was her
loving manner, asked him if it was indeed all over.

'The woman is dead,' said he; 'but I marvel, Anne, to see you so
troubled about her.

Her blood is upon her own head, for we did by no means seek her life.
She hath trodden under foot our laws, and misused our great
forbearance, so that we could do no otherwise than we have done.
So under the Devil's delusion was she, that she wanted no minister
or elder to pray with her at the gallows, but seemed to think herself
sure of heaven, heeding in no wise the warnings of Mr. Norton,
and other godly people.'
"'Did she rail at, or cry out against any?' asked his wife. 'Nay, not
to my hearing,' he said, 'but she carried herself as one who had
done no harm, and who verily believed that she had obeyed the
Lord's will.'
"'This is very dreadful,' said she, 'and I pray that the death of
that poor misled creature may not rest heavy upon us.'
"Hereupon Mr. Norton lifted up his head, which had been bowed down
upon his hand; and I shall never forget how his pale and sharp
features did seem paler than their wont, and his solemn voice
seemed deeper and sadder. 'Madam!' he said, 'it may well befit your
gentleness and sweetness of heart to grieve over the sufferings
even of the froward and ungodly, when they be cut off from the
congregation of the Lord, as His holy and just law enjoineth, for
verily I also could weep for the condemned one, as a woman and a
mother; and, since her coming, I have wrestled with the Lord, in
prayer and fasting, that I might be His instrument in snatching her
as a brand from the burning.

But, as a watchman on the walls of Zion, when I did see her casting
poison into the wells of life, and enticing unstable souls into
the snares and pitfalls of Satan, what should I do but sound an
alarm against her?

And the magistrate, such as your worthy husband, who is also
appointed of God, and set for the defence of the truth, and the
safety of the Church and the State, what can he do but faithfully
to execute the law of God, which is a terror to evil doers?

The natural pity which we feel must give place unto the duty we do
severally owe to God and His Church, and the government of His
appointment.

It is a small matter to be judged of man's judgment, for, though
certain people have not scrupled to call me cruel and hard of
heart, yet the Lord knows I have wept in secret places over these
misguided men and women.

"'But might not life be spared?' asked Madam Broadstreet. 'Death
is a great thing.'
"'It is appointed unto all to die,' said Mr.

Norton, 'and after death cometh the judgment. The death of these poor
bodies is a bitter thing, but the death of the soul is far more
dreadful; and it is better that these people should suffer than that
hundreds of precious souls should be lost through their evil
communication.
"There is no man," cried young Delvile, with emotion, "who might not
rather envy than pity sufferings which give rise to such
compassion!"

"Pecuniary assistance he will not accept," she continued, "and,
indeed, his mind is superior to receiving consolation from such
temporary relief; I wish him, therefore, to be put into some way of
life by which his own talents, which have long enough amused the
world, may at length become serviceable to himself. Do you think,
Sir, this is possible?"

"How do I rejoice," cried Delvile, colouring with pleasure while he
spoke, "in this flattering concurrence of our opinions! see, madam,"
taking from his pocket a letter, "how I have been this very morning
occupied, in endeavouring to procure for Mr Belfield some employment
by which his education might be rendered useful, and his parts
redound to his own credit and advantage."

He then broke the seal, and put into her hand a letter to a
nobleman, whose son was soon going abroad, strongly recommending
Belfield to him in capacity of a tutor.

A sympathy of sentiment so striking impressed them at the same
moment with surprise and esteem; Delvile earnestly regarded her with
eyes of speaking admiration, while the occasion of his notice
rendered it too pleasant to distress her, and filled her with an
inward satisfaction which brightened her whole countenance.

She had only time, in a manner that strongly marked her approbation,
to return the letter, before Mrs Delvile again made her appearance.

During the rest of the evening but little was said; Cecilia was not
talkative, and young Delvile was so absent, that three times his
mother reminded him of an engagement to meet his father, who that
night was expected at the Duke of Derwent's house in town, before he
heard that she spoke to him, and three times more before, when he
had heard, he obeyed.

Cecilia, when she came back to Mr Barrel's, found the house full of
company. She went into the drawing-room, but did not remain there
long: she was grave and thoughtful, she wished to be alone, and by
the earliest opportunity, stole away to her own apartment.

Her mind was now occupied by new ideas, and her fancy was busied in
the delineation of new prospects. She had been struck from her first
meeting young Delvile with an involuntary admiration of his manners
and conversation; she had found upon every succeeding interview
something further to approve, and felt for him a rising partiality
which made her always see him with pleasure, and never part from him
without a wish to see him again. Yet, as she was not of that
inflammable nature which is always ready to take fire, as her
passions were under the controul of her reason, and she suffered not
her affections to triumph over her principles, she started at her
danger the moment she perceived it, and instantly determined to give
no weak encouragement to a prepossession which neither time nor
intimacy had justified. She denied herself the deluding satisfaction
of dwelling upon the supposition of his worth, was unusually
assiduous to occupy all her time, that her heart might have less
leisure for imagination; and had she found that his character
degenerated from the promise of his appearance, the well regulated
purity of her mind would soon have enabled her to have driven him
wholly from her thoughts.

Such was her situation when the circumstances of her affairs
occasioned her becoming an inmate of his house; and here she grew
less guarded, because less clear-sighted to the danger of
negligence, for the frequency of their conversation allowed her
little time to consider their effects. If at first she had been
pleased with his deportment and elegance, upon intimacy she was
charmed with his disposition and his behaviour; she found him manly,
generous, open-hearted and amiable, fond of literature, delighting
in knowledge, kind in his temper, and spirited in his actions.

Qualities such as these, when recommended by high birth, a striking
figure, and polished manners, formed but a dangerous companion for a
young woman, who, without the guard of any former prepossession, was
so fervent an admirer of excellence as Cecilia. Her heart made no
resistance, for the attack was too gentle and too gradual to alarm
her vigilance, and therefore, though always sensible of the pleasure
she received from his society, it was not till she returned to
Portman-square, after having lived under the same roof with him for
a fortnight, that she was conscious her happiness was no longer in
her own power.

Mr Harrel's house, which had never pleased her, now became utterly
disgustful; she was wearied and uncomfortable, yet, willing to
attribute her uneasiness to any other than the true cause, she
fancied the house itself was changed, and that all its inhabitants
and visitors were more than unusually disagreeable: but this idle
error was of short duration, the moment of self-conviction was at
hand, and when Delvile presented her the letter he had written for
Mr Belfield, it flashed in her eyes!

This detection of the altered state of her mind opened to her views
and her hopes a scene entirely new, for neither the exertion of the
most active benevolence, nor the steady course of the most virtuous
conduct, sufficed any longer to wholly engage her thoughts, or
constitute her felicity; she had purposes that came nearer home, and
cares that threatened to absorb in themselves that heart and those
faculties which hitherto had only seemed animated for the service of
others.

Yet this loss of mental freedom gave her not much uneasiness, since
the choice of her heart, though involuntary, was approved by her
principles, and confirmed by her judgment. Young Delvile's situation
in life was just what she wished, more elevated than her own, yet
not so exalted as to humble her with a sense of inferiority; his
connections were honourable, his mother appeared to her the first of
women, his character and disposition seemed formed to make her
happy, and her own fortune was so large, that to the state of his
she was indifferent.

Delighted with so flattering a union of inclination with propriety,
she now began to cherish the partiality she at first had repressed,
and thinking the future destination of her life already settled,
looked forward with grateful joy to the prospect of ending her days
with the man she thought most worthy to be entrusted with the
disposal of her fortune.

She had not, indeed, any certainty that the regard of young Delvile
was reciprocal, but she had every reason to believe he greatly
admired her, and to suspect that his mistaken notion of her prior
engagement, first with Mr Belfield, and afterwards with Sir Robert
Floyer, made him at present check those sentiments in her favour
which, when that error was removed, she hoped to see I encouraged.

Her purpose, therefore, was quietly to wait an explanation, which
she rather wished retarded than forwarded, that her leisure and
opportunity might be more for investigating his character, and
saving herself from repentance.


CHAPTER iii

A CONFLICT.


The day following this happy intellectual arrangement, Cecilia was
visited by Mr Monckton. That gentleman, who had enquired for her
immediately after the Harrels went to their villa, and who had
flattered himself with reaping much advantage from their absence, by
frequent meetings and confidential discourses, suffered the severest
mortification when he found that her stay in town rendered her not
the less inaccessible to him, since he had no personal acquaintance
with the Delviles, and could not venture to present himself at their
house.

He was now received by her with more than usual pleasure; the time
had seemed long to her since she had conversed with him, and she was
eager to ask his counsel and assistance in her affairs. She related
to him the motives which had induced her to go to St James'-square,
and the incorrigible obstinacy with which Mr Harrel still continued
to encourage the addresses of Sir Robert Floyer; she earnestly
entreated him to become her agent in a business to which she was
unequal, by expostulating in her cause with Mr Harrel, and by
calling upon Sir Robert himself to insist upon his foregoing his
unauthorised pretensions.

Mr Monckton listened eagerly to her account and request, and when
she had finished, assured her he would deliberate upon each
circumstance of the affair, and then maturely weigh every method he
could devise, to extricate her from an embarrassment which now grew
far too serious to be safely neglected.

"I will not, however," continued he, "either act or give my opinion
without further enquiry, as I am confident there is a mystery in
this business which lies deeper than we can at present fathom. Mr
Harrel has doubtless purposes of his own to answer by this pretended
zeal for Sir Robert; nor is it difficult to conjecture what they may
be. Friendship, in a man of his light cast, is a mere cover, a mere
name, to conceal a connection which has its basis solely in the
licentious convenience of borrowing money, going to the same gaming
house, and mutually communicating and boasting their mutual vices
and intrigues, while, all the time, their regard for each other is
equally hollow with their regard for truth and integrity."

He then cautioned her to be extremely careful with respect to any
money transactions with Mr Harrel, whose splendid extravagance he
assured her was universally known to exceed his fortune.

The countenance of Cecilia during this exhortation was testimony
sufficient to the penetrating eyes of Mr Monckton that his advice
came not too soon: a suspicion of the real state of the case
speedily occurred to him, and he questioned her minutely upon the
subject. She endeavoured to avoid making him any answer, but his
discernment was too keen for her inartificial evasion, and he very
soon gathered all the particulars of her transactions with Mr
Harrel.

He was less alarmed at the sum she had lent him, which was rather
within his expectations, than at the method she had been induced to
take to procure it. He represented to her in the strongest manner
the danger of imposition, nay of ruin, from the extortions and the
craft of money-lenders; and he charged her upon no consideration to
be tempted or persuaded again to have recourse to such perilous
expedients.

She promised the most attentive observance of his advice: and then
told him the acquaintance she had made with Miss Belfield, and her
sorrow for the situation of her brother; though, satisfied for the
present with the plan of young Delvile, she now gave up her design
of soliciting his counsel.

In the midst of this conversation, a note was delivered to her from
Mr Delvile senior, acquainting her with his return to town, and
begging the favour of her to call in St James's-square the next
morning, as he wished to speak to her upon some business of
importance.

By this time, the house was full of people, French Canadas, where,

morning a little parcel of papers, which she found in the corner
of a closet.

Did you not see them?--Do they not line the hall?--They threaten me
with three executions before night!--three executions unless I
satisfy their immediate demands!--"

"And to what do their demands amount?"

"I know not!--I dare not ask!--to some thousand pounds, perhaps,--
and I have not, at this minute, forty guineas in the house!"

"Nay, then," cried Cecilia, retreating, "I can indeed do nothing! if
their demands are so high, I _ought_ to do nothing."

She would then have quitted him, not more shocked at his situation,
than indignant at the wilful extravagance which had occasioned it.

"Stay," cried he, "and hear me!" then, lowering his voice, "seek
out," he continued, "your unfortunate friend,--go to the poor ruined
Priscilla,--prepare her for tidings of horror! and do not, though
you renounce Me, do not abandon Her!"

Then, fiercely passing her, he was himself leaving the room; but
Cecilia, alarmed by the fury of his manner, called out, "What is it
you mean? what tidings of horror? whither are you going?"

"To hell!" cried he, and rushed out of the apartment.

Cecilia screamed aloud, and conjuring him to hear her, ran after
him; he paid her no regard, but, flying faster than she had power to
pursue, reached his own dressing-room, shut himself into it with
violence, and just as she arrived at the door, turned the key, and
bolted it.

Her terror was now inexpressible; she believed him in the very act
of suicide, and her refusal of assistance seemed the signal for the
deed: her whole fortune, at that moment, was valueless and
unimportant to her, compared with the preservation of a fellow-
creature: she called out with all the vehemence of agony to beg he
would open the door, and eagerly promised by all that was sacred to
do everything in her power to save him.

At these words he opened it; his face was totally without colour,
and he grasped a razor in his hand.

"You have stopt me," said he, in a voice scarce audible, "at the
very moment I had gathered courage for the blow: but if indeed you
will assist me, I will shut this up,--if not, I will steep it in my
blood!"

"I will! I will!" cried Cecilia, "I will do every thing you desire!"

"And quickly?"

"Immediately."

"Before my disgrace is known? and while all may yet be hushed up?"

"Yes, yes! all--any--every thing you wish!"

"Swear, then!"

Here Cecilia drew back; her recollection returned as her terror
abated, and her repugnance to entering into an engagement for she
knew not what, with a man whose actions she condemned, and whose
principles she abhorred, made all her fright now give way to
indignation, and, after a short pause, she angrily answered, "No,
Sir, I will not swear!--but yet, all that is reasonable, all that is
friendly--"

"Hear me swear, then!" interrupted he, furiously, "which at this
moment I do, by every thing eternal, and by every thing infernal,
that I will not outlive the seizure of my property, and that the
moment I am informed there is an execution in my house, shall be the
last of my existence!"

"What cruelty! what compulsion! what impiety!" cried Cecilia: "give
me, however, that horrible instrument, and prescribe to me what
conditions you please."

A noise was now heard below stairs, at which Cecilia, who had not
dared call for help lest he should quicken his desperation, was
secretly beginning to rejoice, when, starting at the sound, he
exclaimed, "I believe you are too late!--the ruffians have already
seized my house!" then, endeavouring to force her out of the room,
"Go," he cried, "to my wife;--I want to be alone!"

"Oh give me first," cried she, "that weapon, and I will take what
oath you please!"

"No, no!--go,--leave me,--" cried he, almost breathless with
emotion, "I must not now be trifled with."

"I do not trifle! indeed I do not!" cried Cecilia, holding by his
arm: "try, put me to the proof!"

"Swear, solemnly swear, to empty my house of these creditors this
moment!"

"I do swear," cried she, with energy, "and Heaven prosper me as I am
sincere!"

"I see, I see you are an angel!" cried he, rapturously, "and as such
I worship and adore you! O you have restored me to life, and rescued
me from perdition!"

"Give me, then, that fatal instrument!"

"That instrument," returned he, "is nothing, since so many others
are in my power; but you have now taken from me all desire of using
them. Go, then, and stop those wretches from coming to me,--send
immediately for the Jew!--he will advance what money you please,--my
man knows where to find him; consult with Mr Arnott,--speak a word
of comfort to Priscilla,--but do nothing, nothing at all, till you
have cleared my house of those cursed scoundrels!"

Cecilia, whose heart sunk within her at the solemn promise she had
given, the mention of the Jew, and the arduous task she had
undertaken, quitted him without reply, and was going to her own
room, to compose her hurried spirits, and consider what steps she
had to take, when hearing the noise in the hall grow louder, she
stopt to listen, and catching some words that greatly alarmed her,
went half way down stairs, when she was met by Davison, Mr Harrel's
man, of whom she enquired into the occasion of the disturbance.

He answered that he must go immediately to his master, for the
bailiffs were coming into the house.

"Let him not know it if you value his life!" cried she, with new
terror. "Where is Mr Arnott? call him to me,--beg him to come this
moment;--I will wait for him here."

The man flew to obey her; and Cecilia, finding she had time neither
for deliberation nor regret, and dreading lest Mr Harrel, by hearing
of the arrival of the bailiffs, should relapse into despair,
determined to call to her aid all the courage, prudence, and
judgment she possessed, and, since to act she was compelled,
endeavour with her best ability, to save his credit, and retrieve
his affairs.

"
Mr Arnott then confessed that he should himself have instantly been
bail for his brother, but that his fortune, originally not large,
was now so much impaired by the many debts which from time to time
he had paid for him, that as he hoped some day to have a family of
his own, he dare not run a risk by which he might be utterly ruined,
and the less, as his sister had at Violet Bank been prevailed upon
to give up her settlement.

This account, which explained the late uneasiness of Mrs Harrel,
still encreased the distress of Cecilia; and every moment she
obtained for reflection, augmented her reluctance to parting with
_so_ large a sum of money for so worthless an object, and added
strength to her resentment for the unjustifiable menaces which had
extorted from her such a promise. Yet not an instant would she
listen to Mr Arnott's offer of fulfilling her engagement, and
charged him, as he considered her own self-esteem worth her keeping,
not to urge to her a proposal so ungenerous and selfish.

Davison now came again to hasten her, and said that the Jew was with
his master, and they both impatiently expected her.

Cecilia, half distracted with her uncertainty how to act, changed
colour at this message, and exclaimed "Oh Mr Arnott, run I beseech
you for Mr Monckton! bring him hither directly,--if any body can
save me it is him; but if I go back to Mr Harrel, I know it will be
all over!"

"Certainly," said Mr Arnott, "I will run to him this moment."

"Yet no!--stop!--" cried the trembling Cecilia, "he can now do me no
good,--his counsel will arrive too late to serve me,--it cannot call
back the oath I have given! it cannot, compulsatory as it was, make
me break it, and not be miserable for ever!"

This idea sufficed to determine her; and the apprehension of self-
reproach, should the threat of Mr Harrel be put in execution, was
more insupportable to her blameless and upright mind, than any loss
or diminution which her fortune could sustain.

Slowly however, with tardy and unwilling steps, her judgment
repugnant, and her spirit repining, she obeyed the summons of Mr
Harrel, who, impatient of her delay, came forward to meet her.

"Miss Beverley," he cried, "there is not a moment to be lost; this
good man will bring you any sum of money, upon a proper
consideration, that you will command; but if he is not immediately
commissioned, and these cursed fellows are not got out of my house,
the affair will be blown,"---"and what will follow," added he,
lowering his voice, "I will not again frighten you by repeating,
though I shall never recant."

Cecilia turned from him in horror; and, with a faltering voice and
heavy heart, entreated Mr Arnott to settle for her with the Jew.

O madam, your honored husband can tell you what travail of spirit,
what sore trials, these disturbers have cost us; and as you do know
in his case, so believe also in mine, that what we have done
hath been urged, not by hardness and cruelty of heart, but rather
by our love and tenderness towards the Lord's heritage in this
land.

Through care and sorrow I have grown old before my time; few and
evil have been the days of my pilgrimage, and the end seems not far
off; and though I have many sins and shortcomings to answer for,
I do humbly trust that the blood of the souls of the flock committed
to me will not then be found upon my garments.'
"Ah, me!

I shall never forget these words of that godly man," continued
my aunt, "for, as he said, his end was not far off. He died very
suddenly, and the Quakers did not scruple to say that it was God's
judgment upon him for his severe dealing with their people.

They even go so far as to say that the land about Boston is cursed because
of the hangings and whippings, inasmuch as wheat will not now grow
here, as it did formerly, and, indeed, many, not of their way, do
believe the same thing."

April 24.

A vessel from London has just come to port, bringing Rebecca's
dresses for the wedding, which will take place about the middle of
June, as I hear. Uncle Rawson has brought me a long letter from Aunt
Grindall, with one also from Oliver, pleasant and lively,
like himself. No special news from abroad that I hear of. My heart
longs for Old England more and more.

It is supposed that the freeholders have chosen Mr.

Broadstreet for their Governor. The vote, uncle says, is exceeding
small, very few people troubling themselves about it.

May 2.

Mr. John Easton, a man of some note in the Providence Plantations,
having occasion to visit Boston yesterday, brought me a message from
my brother, to the effect that he was now married and settled, and
did greatly desire me to make the journey to his house in the company
of his friend, John Easton, and his wife's sister. I feared to
break the matter to my uncle, but Rebecca hath done so for me, and
he hath, to my great joy, consented thereto; for, indeed, he refuseth
nothing to her.

My aunt fears for me, that I shall suffer from the cold, as the
weather is by no means settled, although the season is forward, as
compared with the last; but I shall take good care as to clothing;
and John Easton saith we shall be but two nights on the way.

THE PLANTATIONS, May 10, 1679.

We left Boston on the 4th, at about sunrise, and rode on at a brisk
trot, until we came to the banks of the river, along which we went
near a mile before we found a suitable ford, and even there the
water was so deep that we only did escape a wetting by drawing our
feet up to the saddle-trees.

About noon, we stopped at a farmer's house, in the hope of getting a
dinner; but the room was dirty as an Indian wigwam, with two
children in it, sick with the measles, and the woman herself in a
poor way, and we were glad to leave as soon as possible, and get
into the fresh air again.

Aunt had provided me with some cakes, and Mr.

Easton, who is an old traveller, had with him a roasted fowl and a
good loaf of Indian bread; so, coming to a spring of excellent
water, we got off our horses, and, spreading our napkins on the
grass and dry leaves, had a comfortable dinner.

John's sister is a widow, a lively, merry woman, and proved rare
company for me. Afterwards we rode until the sun was nigh
setting, when we came to a little hut on the shore of a broad lake
at a place called Massapog. It had been dwelt in by a white
family formerly, but it was now empty, and much decayed in the
roof, and as we did ride up to it we saw a wild animal of some sort
leap out of one of its windows, and run into the pines. Here Mr.
Easton said we must make shift to tarry through the night, as it was
many miles to the house of a white man. So, getting off our
horses, we went into the hut, which had but one room, with loose
boards for a floor; and as we sat there in the twilight, it looked
dismal enough; but presently Mr.

Easton, coming in with a great load of dried boughs, struck a light
in the stone fireplace, and we soon had a roaring fire. His sister
broke off some hemlock boughs near the door, and made a broom
of them, with which she swept up the floor, so that when we sat
down on blocks by the hearth, eating our poor supper, we thought
ourselves quite comfortable and tidy.

It was a wonderful clear night, the moon rising, as we judged,
about eight of the clock, over the tops of the hills on the easterly
side of the lake, and shining brightly on the water in a long line
of light, as if a silver bridge had been laid across it.

Looking out into the forest, we could see the beams of the moon,
falling here and there through the thick tops of the pines and hemlocks,
and showing their tall trunks, like so many pillars in a church
or temple.

There was a westerly wind blowing, not steadily, but in long
gusts, which, sounding from a great distance through the pine leaves,
did make a solemn and not unpleasing music, to which I listened
at the door until the cold drove me in for shelter. Our horses having
been fed with corn, which Mr.
Easton took with him, were tied at the back of the building, under the
cover of a thick growth of hemlocks, which served to break off the
night wind. The widow and I had a comfortable bed in the corner of
the room, which we made of small hemlock sprigs, having our cloaks
to cover us, and our saddlebags for pillows. My companions were
soon asleep, but the exceeding strangeness of my situation did keep
me a long time awake.

For, as I lay there looking upward, I could see the stars shining
down a great hole in the roof, and the moonlight streaming through
the seams of the logs, and mingling with the red glow of
the coals on the hearth. I could hear the horses stamping, just
outside, and the sound of the water on the lake shore, the cry of
wild animals in the depth of the woods, and, over all, the long and
very wonderful murmur of the pines in the wind.

At last, being sore weary, I fell asleep, and waked not until I
felt the warm sun shining in my face, and heard the voice of Mr.
Easton bidding me rise, as the horses were ready.

After riding about two hours we came upon an Indian camp, in the
midst of a thick wood of maples.

Here were six spacious wigwams; but the men were away, except two
very old and infirm ones.

There were five or six women, and perhaps twice as many children,
who all came out to see us.
They brought us some dried meat, as hard nigh upon as chips of
wood, and which, although hungry, I could feel no stomach for; but
I bought of one of the squaws two great cakes of sugar, made from the
sap of the maples which abound there, very pure and sweet, and
which served me instead of their unsavory meat and cakes of pounded
corn, of which Mr. Easton and his sister did not scruple to partake.

Leaving them, we had a long and hard ride to a place called
Winnicinnit, where, to my great joy, we found a comfortable
house and Christian people, with whom we tarried.
The next day we got to the Plantations; and about noon, from the top
of a hill, Mr. Easton pointed out the settlement where my brother
dwelt,-- a fair, pleasant valley, through which ran a small river,
with the houses of the planters on either side.

Shortly after, we came to a new frame house, with a great oak-tree
left standing on each side of the gate, and a broad meadow before
it, stretching down to the water.

Here Mr.

Easton stopped; and now, who should come hastening down to us but
my new sister, Margaret, in her plain but comely dress, kindly
welcoming me; and soon my brother came up from the meadow, where
he was busy with his men.

It was indeed a joyful meeting.

The next day being the Sabhath, I went with my brother and his wife
to the meeting, which was held in a large house of one of their
Quaker neighbors.

About a score of grave, decent people did meet there, sitting still
and quiet for a pretty while, when one of their number, a venerable
man, spake a few words, mostly Scripture; then a young woman, who,
I did afterwards learn, had been hardly treated by the Plymouth
people, did offer a few words of encouragement and exhortation from
this portion of the 34th Psalm: "The angel of the Lord encampeth
round about them that fear him, and delivereth them."

When the meeting was over, some of the ancient women came and spake
kindly to me, inviting me to their houses.

In the evening certain of these people came to my brother's, and were
kind and loving towards me. There was, nevertheless, a gravity
and a certain staidness of deportment which I could but ill
conform unto, and I was not sorry when they took leave.

My Uncle Rawson need not fear my joining with them; for, although I
do judge them to be a worthy and pious people, I like not their
manner of worship, and their great gravity and soberness do little
accord with my natural temper and spirits.

May 16.

This place is in what is called the Narragansett country, and about
twenty miles from Mr. Williams's town of Providence, a place of no
small note. Mr. Williams, who is now an aged man, more than
fourscore, was the founder of the Province, and is held in
great esteem by the people, who be of all sects and persuasions,
as the Government doth not molest any in worshipping according to
conscience; and hence you will see in the same neighborhood
Anabaptists, Quakers, New Lights, Brownists, Antinomians, and
Socinians,--nay, I am told there be Papists also.

Mr.
Williams is a Baptist, and holdeth mainly with Calvin and Beza, as
respects the decrees, and hath been a bitter reviler of the Quakers,
although he hath ofttimes sheltered them from the rigor of the
Massachusetts Bay magistrates, who he saith have no warrant to deal
in matters of conscience and religion, as they have done.

Yesterday came the Governor of the Rhode Island, Nicholas Easton,
the father of John, with his youngest daughter Mary, as fair and
as ladylike a person as I have seen for many a day.

Both her father and herself do meet with the "Friends," as they call
themselves, at their great house on the Island, and the Governor
sometimes speaks therein, having, as one of the elders here saith
of him, "a pretty gift in the ministry." Mary, who is about the
age of my brother's wife, would fain persuade us to go back with
them on the morrow to the Island, but Leonard's business will not
allow it, and I would by no means lose his company while I tarry
in these parts, as I am so soon to depart for home, where a great
ocean will separate us, it may be for many years.

Margaret, who hath been to the Island, saith that the Governor's
house is open to all new-comers, who are there entertained with
rare courtesy, he being a man of substance, having a great plantation,
with orchards and gardens, and a stately house on an hill over-looking
the sea on either hand, where, six years ago, when the famous George
Fox was on the Island, he did entertain and lodge no less than
fourscore persons, beside his own family and servants.

Governor Easton, who is a pleasant talker, told a story of a
magistrate who had been a great persecutor of his people.

On one occasion, after he had cast a worthy Friend into jail, he
dreamed a dream in this wise:
He thought he was in a fair, delightsome place, where were sweet
springs of water and green meadows, and rare fruit-trees and vines
with ripe clusters thereon, and in the midst thereof flowed a river
whose waters were clearer than crystal.

Moreover, he did behold a great multitude walking on the river's
bank, or sitting lovingly in the shade of the trees which grew thereby.
Now, while he stood marvelling at all this, he beheld in his dream
the man he had cast into prison sitting with his hat on, side by
side with a minister then dead, whom the magistrate had held in
great esteem while living; whereat, feeling his anger stirred within
him, he went straight and bade the man take off his hat in the
presence of his betters.

Howbeit the twain did give no heed to his words, but did continue to
talk lovingly together as before; whereupon he waxed exceeding wroth,
and would have laid hands upon the man.

But, hearing a voice calling upon him to forbear, he did look about
him, and behold one, with a shining countenance, and clad in raiment
so white that it did dazzle his eyes to look upon it, stood before
him. And the shape said, "Dost thou well to be angry?" Then said the
magistrate, "Yonder is a Quaker with his hat on talking to a godly
minister."

"Nay," quoth the shape, "thou seest but after the manner of the
world and with the eyes of flesh.

Look yonder, and tell me what thou seest."

So he looked again, and lo!

two men in shining raiment, like him who talked with him, sat under
the tree.

"Tell me," said the shape, "if thou canst, which of the twain is the
Quaker and which is the Priest?"

And when he could not, but stood in amazement confessing he did see
neither of them, the shape said, "Thou sayest well, for here be
neither Priest nor Quaker, Jew nor Gentile, but all are one in the
Lord."

Then he awoke, and pondered long upon his dream, and when it
was morning he went straightway to the jail, and ordered the man
to be set free, and hath ever since carried himself lovingly towards
the Quakers.

My brother's lines have indeed fallen unto him in a pleasant,
place.
His house is on a warm slope of a hill, looking to the southeast, with
a great wood of oaks and walnuts behind it, and before it many
acres of open land, where formerly the Indians did plant their corn,
much of which is now ploughed and seeded.

From the top of the hill one can see the waters of the great Bay; at
the foot of it runs a small river noisily over the rocks, making
a continual murmur.

Going thither this morning, I found a great rock hanging
over the water, on which I sat down, listening to the noise of the
stream and the merriment of the birds in the trees, and admiring
the green banks, which were besprinkled with white and yellow
flowers.

I call to mind that sweet fancy of the lamented Anne Broadstreet,
the wife of the new Governor of Massachusetts, in a little piece
which she nameth "Contemplations," being written on the banks of a
stream, like unto the one whereby I was then sitting, in which the
writer first describeth the beauties of the wood, and the flowing
water, with the bright fishes therein, and then the songs of birds
in the boughs over her head, in this sweet and pleasing verse, which
I have often heard repeated by Cousin Rebecca:--
"While musing thus, with contemplation fed, And thousand fancies
buzzing in my brain, A sweet-tongued songster perched above my head,
And chanted forth her most melodious strain; Which rapt me so with
wonder and delight, I judged my hearing better than my sight, And
wished me wings with her a while to take my flight.

"O merry bird! said I, that fears no snares, That neither toils nor
hoards up in the barn, Feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating
cares, To gain more good, or shun what might thee harm.
Thy clothes ne'er wear, thy meat is everywhere, Thy bed a bough,
thy drink the water clear, Reminds not what is past, nor what's
to come dost fear.

"The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent, Sets hundred notes
unto thy feathered crew, So each one tunes his pretty instrument,
And, warbling out the old, begins the new.

And thus they pass their youth in summer season, Then follow thee
unto a better region, Where winter's never felt by that sweet airy
legion."

Now, while I did ponder these lines, hearing a step in the leaves,
I looked up, and behold there was an old Indian close beside me;
and, being much affrighted, I gave a loud cry, and ran towards the
house.

The old man laughed at this, and, calling after me, said he would not
harm me; and Leonard, hearing my cries, now coming up, bade me never
fear the Indian, for he was a harmless creature, who was well known
to him.

So he kindly saluted the old man, asking me to shake hands with
him, which I did, when he struck across the field to a little
cleared spot on the side of the hill.

My brother bidding me note his actions, I saw him stoop down on his
knees, with his head to the ground, for some space of time, and
then, getting up, he stretched out his hands towards the southwest,
as if imploring some one whom I could not see.

This he repeated for nigh upon half an hour, when he came back to
the house, where he got some beer and bread to eat, and a great
loaf to carry away.
He said but little until he rose to depart, when he told my brother
that he had been to see the graves of his father and his mother,
and that he was glad to find them as he did leave them the last
year; for he knew that the spirits of the dead would be sore grieved,
if the white man's hoe touched their bones.

My brother promised him that the burial-place of his people should
not be disturbed, and that he would find it as now, when he did
again visit it.

"Me never come again," said the old Indian. "No. Umpachee is
very old.
He has no squaw; he has no young men who call him father.

Umpachee is like that tree;" and he pointed, as he spoke, to
a birch, which stood apart in the field, from which the bark had
fallen, and which did show no leaf nor bud.

My brother hereupon spake to him of the great Father of both white
and red men, and of his love towards them, and of the measure of
light which he had given unto all men, whereby they might know
good from evil, and by living in obedience to which they might be
happy in this life and in that to come; exhorting him to put his
trust in God, who was able to comfort and sustain him in his old
age, and not to follow after lying Powahs, who did deceive and
mislead him.

"My young brother's talk is good," said the old man. "The
Great Father sees that his skin is white, and that mine is red.
He sees my young brother when he sits in his praying-house, and
me when me offer him corn and deer's flesh in the woods, and he
says good.

Umpachee's people have all gone to one place. If Umpachee go to a
praying-house, the Great Father will send him to the white man's
place, and his father and his mother and his sons will never see him
in their hunting-ground. No.

Umpachee is an old beaver that sits in his own house, and swims in
his own pond.

He will stay where he is, until his Father calls him."
Saying this, the old savage went on his way. As he passed out of the
valley, and got to the top of the hill on the other side, we,
looking after him, beheld him standing still a moment, as if bidding
farewell to the graves of his people.

May 24.

My brother goes with me to-morrow on my way to Boston.

I am not a little loath to leave my dear sister Margaret, who hath
greatly won upon me by her gentleness and loving deportment, and
who doth at all times, even when at work in ordering her household
affairs, and amidst the cares and perplexities of her new life,
show forth that sweetness of temper and that simplicity wherewith
I was charmed when I first saw her.

She hath naturally an ingenious mind, and, since her acquaintance with
my brother, hath dipped into such of his studies and readings as
she had leisure and freedom to engage in, so that her conversation
is in no wise beneath her station.

Nor doth she, like some of her people, especially the more simple
and unlearned, affect a painful and melancholy look and a canting
tone of discourse, but lacketh not for cheerfulness and a certain
natural ease and grace of demeanor; and the warmth and goodness of
her heart doth at times break the usual quiet of her countenance,
like to sunshine and wind on a still water, and she hath the sweetest
smile I ever saw.

A
secret idea of fame makes his forbearance of happiness supportable
to him: for he has now the self-satisfaction of considering himself
raised to that highest pinnacle of fashionable refinement which is
built upon apathy and scorn, and from which, proclaiming himself
superior to all possibility of enjoyment, he views the whole world
with contempt! holding neither beauty, virtue, wealth, nor power of
importance sufficient to kindle the smallest emotion!"

"O that they could all round listen to you!" cried Cecilia; "they
would soon, I think, sicken of their folly, if they heard it thus
admirably exposed."

"No; they would but triumph that it had obtained them so much
notice!--But pray do you see that gentleman, or don't you chuse to
know him, who has been bowing to you this half hour?"

"Where?" cried Cecilia, and, looking round, perceived Mr Morrice;
who, upon her returning his salutation, instantly approached her,
though he had never ventured to shew himself at Mr Harrel's, since
his unfortunate accident on the evening of the masquerade.

Entirely casting aside the easy familiarity at which he had latterly
arrived, he enquired after her health with the most fearful
diffidence, and then, bowing profoundly, was modestly retiring; when
Mrs Harrel perceiving him, smiled with so much good-humour, that he
gathered courage to return and address her, and found her, to his
infinite delight, as obliging and civil as ever.

The Concert was now over; the ladies arose, and the gentlemen joined
them. Morrice, at sight of Mr Harrel, was again shrinking; but Mr
Harrel, immediately shaking hands with him, enquired what had kept
him so long from Portman-Square? Morrice then, finding, to his great
surprise, that no one had thought more of the mischief but himself
who had committed it, joyously discarded his timidity, and became as
sprightly as before his mortification.

A motion was now made for going to the tea-room; and as they walked
on, Cecilia, in looking up to examine the building, saw in one of
the galleries young Delvile, and almost at the same time caught his
eye.

Scarcely now did a moment elapse before he joined her. The sight of
him, strongly reviving in her mind the painful contrariety of
opinion with which she had lately thought of him, the sentiments so
much in his favour which but a few days before she had encouraged,
and which it was only that morning she had endeavoured to crush,
made her meet him with a kind of melancholy that almost induced her
to lament he was amiable, and repine that she knew none like him.

His appearance, meantime, was far different; he seemed enchanted at
the sight of her, he flew eagerly to meet her, and his eyes sparkled
with pleasure as he approached her; a pleasure neither moderate nor
disguised, but lively, unrestrained, and expressive.

Cecilia, whose plans since she had last seen him had twice varied,
who first had looked forward to being united with him for ever, and
afterwards had determined to avoid with him even a common
acquaintance, could not, while these thoughts were all recurring to
her memory, receive much delight from observing his gaiety, or feel
at all gratified by his unembarrassed manners. The openness of his
attentions, and the frankness of his admiration, which hitherto had
charmed her as marks of the sincerity of his character, now shocked
her as proofs of the indifference of his heart, which feeling for
her a mere common regard, that affected neither his spirits nor his
peace, he manifested without scruple, since it was not accompanied
with even a wish beyond the present hour.

She now, too, recollected that such had always been his conduct, one
single and singular moment excepted, when, as he gave to her his
letter for Mr Belfield, he seemed struck as she was herself by the
extraordinary co-incidence of their ideas and proceedings: that
emotion, however, she now regarded as casual and transitory, and
seeing him so much happier than herself, she felt ashamed of her
delusion, and angry at her easy captivation.

Reflections such as these, though they added fresh motives to her
resolution of giving up all thoughts of his alliance, were yet so
humiliating, that they robbed her of all power of receiving pleasure
from what was passing, and made her forget that the place she was in
was even intended for a place of entertainment.

Young Delvile, after painting in lively colours the loss his house
had sustained by her quitting it, and dwelling with equal force upon
the regret of his mother and his own, asked in a low voice if she
would do him so much honour as to introduce him to Mr Harrel; "As
the son," added he, "of a brother guardian, I think I have a kind of
claim to his acquaintance."

Cecilia could not refuse, though as the request was likely to
occasion more frequent meetings, she persuaded herself she was
unwilling to comply. The ceremony therefore past, and was again
repeated with Mrs Harrel, who, though she had several times seen
him, had never been formally made known to him.

The Harrels were both of them much pleased at this mark of civility
in a young man whose family had prepared them rather to expect his
scorn, and expressed their wishes that he would drink his tea in
their party; he accepted their invitation with alacrity, and turning
to Cecilia, said, "Have I not skilfully timed my introduction! But
though you have done me this honour with Mr and Mrs Harrel, I must
not yet, I presume, entreat you to extend it to a certain happy
gentleman of this company;" glancing his eyes toward Sir Robert
Floyer.

"No, Sir," answered she, with quickness, "yet, nor ever!"

They were now at the door leading down stairs to the tea-room.
Cecilia saw that Sir Robert, who had hitherto been engaged with some
gentlemen, seemed to be seeking her; and the remembrance of the
quarrel which had followed her refusal of his assistance at the
Opera-house, obliged her to determine, should he offer it again, to
accept it: but the same brutality which forced this intention,
contributed to render it repugnant to her, and she resolved if
possible to avoid him, by hurrying down stairs before he reached
her. She made, therefore, a sudden attempt to slip through the
crowd, and as she was light and active, she easily succeeded; but
though her hasty motion separated her from the rest of her party,
Delvile, who was earnestly looking at her, to discover her meaning
in the disclaiming speech she made about Sir Robert, saw into her
design, but suffered her not to go alone; he contrived in a moment
to follow and join her, while she was stopping at the foot of the
stairs for Mrs Harrel.

"Why what a little thief you are," cried he, "to run away from us
thus! what do you think Sir Robert will say? I saw him looking for
you at the very instant of your flight."

"Then you saw at the same time," said Cecilia, "the reason of it."

"Will you give me leave," cried he, laughing, "to repeat this to my
Lord Ernolf?"

"You may repeat it, Sir, if you please," said Cecilia, piqued that
he had not rather thought of himself than of Lord Ernolf, "to the
whole Pantheon."

"And if I should, "cried he, "half of it, at least, would thank me;
and to obtain the applause of so noble an assembly, what would it
signify that Sir Robert should cut my throat?"

"I believe," said Cecilia, deeply mortified by a raillery that
shewed so little interest in her avowal of indifference, "you are
determined to make me as sick of that man's name, as I am of his
conversation."

"And is it possible," exclaimed Delvile, in a tone of surprise,
"that such can be your opinion, and yet, situated as you are, the
whole world at your command, and all mankind at your devotion--but I
am answering you seriously, when you are only speaking by rule."

"What rule, Sir?"

"That which young ladies, upon certain occasions, always prescribe
themselves."

Here they were interrupted by the arrival of the rest of the
company; though not before Cecilia had received some little
consolation for her displeasure, by finding that young Delvile still
supposed she was engaged, and flattering herself his language would
be different were he informed of the contrary.

Morrice now undertook to procure them a table for tea, which, as the
room was very full, was not easily done; and while they were waiting
his success, Miss Larolles, who from the stairs had perceived
Cecilia, came running up to her, and taking her hand, called out
"Lord, my dear creature, who'd have thought of seeing you here? I
was never so surprised in my life! I really thought you was gone
into a convent, it's so extreme long since I've seen you. But of all
things in the world, why was you not at Lady Nyland's last assembly?
I thought of asking Mrs Harrel fifty times why you did not come, but
it always went out of my head. You've no notion how excessively I
was disappointed."

"You are very obliging," said Cecilia laughing, "but I hope, since
you so often forgot it, the disappointment did [not] much lessen
your entertainment."

"O Lord no! I was never so happy in my life. There was such a crowd,
you could not move a finger. Every body in the world was there.
You've no idea how delightful it was. I thought verily I should have
fainted with the heat."

"That was delightful indeed! And how long did you stay?"

"Why we danced till three in the morning. We began with Cotillons,
and finished with country dances. It was the most elegant thing you
ever saw in your life; every thing quite in a style. I was so
monstrously fatigued, I could hardly get through the last dance. I
really thought I should have dropt down dead. Only conceive dancing
five hours in such a monstrous crowd! I assure you when I got home
my feet were all blisters. You have no idea how they smarted."

"And whence comes it," cried young Delvile, "that _you_ partake
so little of these delights?"

"Because I fear," answered Cecilia, "I came too late into the school
of fashion to be a ductile pupil."

"Do you know," continued Miss Larolles, "Mr Meadows has not spoke
one word to me all the evening! Though I am sure he saw me, for I
sat at the outside on purpose to speak to a person or two, that I
knew would be strolling about; for if one sits on the inside,
there's no speaking to a creature, you know, so I never do it at the
Opera, nor in the boxes at Ranelagh, nor any where. It's the
shockingest thing you can conceive to be made sit in the middle of
those forms; one might as well be at home, for nobody can speak to
one,"

"But you don't seem to have had much better success," said Cecilia,
"in keeping at the outside."

"O yes I have, for I got a little chat with two or three people as
they were passing, for, you know, when one sits there, they can't
help saying something; though I assure you all the men are so
exceedingly odd they don't care whether they speak to one or no. As
to Mr Meadows, he's really enough to provoke one to death. I suppose
he's in one of his absent fits. However, I assure you I think it's
extreme impertinent of him, and so I shall tell Mr Sawyer, for I
know he'll make a point of telling him of it again."

"I rather think," said Cecilia, "the best would be to return the
compliment in kind, and when he next recollects you, appear to have
forgotten him."

"O Lord, that's a very good notion! so I will, I declare. But you
can't conceive how glad I am the Concert's over; for I assure you,
though I sat as near the fire as possible, I was so extreme cold
you've no idea, for Mr Meadows never would let me have the least
peep at it. I declare I believe he does it on purpose to plague one,
for he grows worse and worse every day. You can't think how I hate
him!"

"Not easily, I believe indeed!" said Cecilia, archly.

"O do but look!" resumed the fair VOLUBLE, "if there is not Mrs
Mears in her old red gown again! I begin to think she'll never have
another. I wish she was to have an execution in her house, if it was
only to get rid of it! I am so fatigued with the sight of it you
can't conceive."

Mr Morrice now brought intelligence that he had secured one side of
a table which would very well accommodate the ladies; and that the
other side was only occupied by one gentleman, who, as he was not
drinking tea himself, would doubtless give up his place when the
party appeared.

Miss Larolles then ran back to her own set, and the rest followed Mr
Morrice; Mrs Harrell, Mrs Mears and Cecilia took their places. The
gentleman opposite to them proved to be Mr Meadows: Morrice,
therefore, was much deceived in his expectations, for, far from
giving up his place, he had flung himself all along upon the form in
such a lounging posture, while he rested one arm upon the table,
that, not contented with merely keeping his own seat, he filled up a
space meant for three.

Mr Harrel had already walked off to another party: Delvile stood
aloof for some minutes, expecting Sir Robert Floyer would station
himself behind Cecilia; but Sir Robert, who would scarce have
thought such a condescension due to a princess, disdained any
appearance of assiduity, even while he made it his care to publish
his pretensions: and therefore, finding no accommodation to please
him, he stalked towards some gentlemen in another part of the room.
Delvile then took the post he had neglected, and Mr Arnott, who had
not had courage to make any effort in his own favour, modestly stood
near him. Cecilia contrived to make room for Mr Gosport next to
herself, and Morrice was sufficiently happy in being allowed to call
the waiters, superintend, the provisions, and serve the whole party.

The task of making tea fell upon Cecilia, who being somewhat
incommoded by the vicinity of her neighbours, Mrs Mears called out
to Mr Meadows "Do pray, Sir, be so good as to make room for one of
us at your side."

But observation has shown, that though the prevailing lower winds of
our latitude move eastward, still their motion is toward the north
rather than the south; so that they appear to contradict the theory
by which the trade-winds are explained.

To account for these anomalies, Lieut. Maury has invented a very
ingenious hypothesis, which is published in his "Physical Geography
of the Sea."

He supposes that the air, which passes from the equator toward the
poles in the upper regions of the atmosphere, is brought down to
the surface of the earth beyond the calms of the tropics, and that
it thence proceeds with an increasing eastward motion, appearing
in our northern hemisphere as the prevailing northeastward winds.

Approaching the poles with a spiral motion, the air there rises,
according to this hypothesis, in a vortex, and returns toward the
equator in the upper atmosphere, gradually acquiring a westward
motion; till, returning to the tropics, it is again brought down
to the earth, and thence proceeds, with a still increasing westward
motion, as the trade-winds.

At the equator the air rises again, and, according to Lieut. Maury,
crosses to the other side, and proceeds through a similar course
in the other hemisphere.

The rising of the air at the equator is supposed to cause the
equatorial rains; and the drought of the tropics is also explained
by that descent of the air, in these latitudes, which this hypothesis
supposes.

Now although this hypothesis explains the phenomena, it has still
met with great opposition. The motions which Lieut. Maury supposes
can hardly be accounted for without resorting, as is usual in such
cases, to electricity or magnetism,--to some occult cause, or some
occult operation of a known cause.

Moreover, it has been difficult for the mechanical philosopher to
understand how the winds manage to cross each other, as Lieut.

Maury supposes them to do, at the equator and the tropics, without
getting into "entangling alliances." If this hypothesis were advanced,
not as a physical explanation of the phenomena, but, like the
epicycles and eccentrics of Ptolemy, "to save the appearances," its
ingenuity would be greatly to its author's credit; but, like the
epicycles and eccentrics, though it represents the phenomena well
enough, it contradicts laws of motion, now well known, which ought
to be familiar to every physical philosopher.

But these speculations of Lieut. Maury will now be superseded by a new
theory of atmospheric movements, an account of which was presented
by its author, Mr. J. Thompson, at the recent meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science. [1]
[Footnote 1: A fuller discussion of this theory the author reserved
for the Royal Society.

The _London Athenaeum_ gives a brief abstract of his paper, in its
report of the proceedings of the Association.]
Mr. Thompson's theory takes account of forces, hitherto unnoticed,
which are generated by the eastward circulation of the atmosphere
in high latitudes.

He shows that these forces cause the prevailing northeastward
under-current of our latitudes, while above this, yet below the
highest northeastward current, the air ought still to move southward
according to Halley's theory.

This under-current is not the immediate effect of differences of
temperature, but a secondary effect induced by the friction of the
earth's surface and the continual deflection of the air's eastward
motion from a great circle, (in which the air tends to move,) into
the small circle of the latitude, in which the air actually does
move.

The force of this deflection, measured by the centrifugal force of
the air as it circulates around the pole, retards the movement from
the equator, and finally wholly suspends it; so that the upper
air circulates around in the higher latitudes as water may be
made to circulate in a pail; and the air is drawn away from the
polar regions as this circulatory motion is communicated to it,
and tends to accumulate in the middle latitudes, as the circulating
water is heaped up around the sides of the pail.

   Hence, in the middle latitudes there is
   a greater weight of air than at the poles, and this tends to press
the lower air to higher latitudes.

Centrifugal force, however, balances this pressure, so long as the
lower air moves with the velocity of the upper strata; but as the
friction of the earth retards its motion and diminishes its
centrifugal force, it gradually yields to the pressure of the air
above it, and moves toward the poles. Near the polar circles it
is again retarded by its increasing centrifugal force, and it
returns through the middle regions of the atmosphere.

Thus there are two systems of atmospheric circulation in each
hemisphere. The principal one extends from the equator to high middle
latitudes and partly overlies the other, which extends from the
tropical calms to the polar circles. These two circulations move
in opposite directions; like two wheels, when one communicates its
motion to the other by the contact of their circumferences.

In the middle latitudes the lower current of the principal circulation
lies upon the upper current of the secondary circulation, and both
move together toward the equator. This principal lower current first
touches the earth's surface beyond the tropical calms, and having
lost its relative eastward motion and now tending westward, it
appears as the trade-wind, very regular and constant; while the
upper secondary current returns, without reaching the tropics, as
an undercurrent, and in our latitude appears as the prevailing
northeastward wind,--a very feeble motion, usually lost in the
weather winds and other disturbances, and only appearing distinctly
in the general average.

Mr. Thompson illustrates the effect of the friction of the earth's
surface on the eastward circulation of the air by a very
simple experiment with a pail of water. If we put into the pail grains
of any material a little heavier than water, and then give the water
a rotatory motion by stirring it, the grains ought, by the centrifugal
force imparted to them, to collect around the sides of the pail;
but, sinking to the bottom, they do in fact tend to collect at the
centre, carried inward by those currents which the friction of the
sides and bottom indirectly produces.

Thus Mr. Thompson's beautiful and philosophical theory completes
that of Halley, and explains all those apparent anomalies which
have hitherto seemed irreconcilable with the only rational
account of the trade-winds. The rainless calms of the tropics are
explained by this theory without that crossing and interference
of winds which Lieut.

Maury supposes; for the secondary circulation returns
as an under-current toward the poles without reaching the
tropics, and the dry lower current of the principal circulation
passes over the tropical latitudes, in its gradual descent,
before it reaches the earth as the trade-winds.

These trade-winds, absorbing moisture from the sea, precipitate
it as they rise again, and produce the constant equatorial
rains; and these rains, doubtless, tend much more powerfully than
the mere unequal distribution of heat to direct the wind toward the
equator; for the fall of rain rapidly diminishes the pressure of
the air and disturbs its equilibrium, so that violent winds are
frequently observed to blow toward rainy districts.

Thus, primarily, the unequal distribution of heat, and, more immediately,
the equatorial rains cause the principal circulation of our
atmosphere; and this indirectly produces the secondary circulation
of Mr. Thompson's theory. Both these regular movements are, however,
greatly disturbed, and especially the latter, by winds which are
occasioned by local and irregular rains.

In these movements and their causes we have the general outline of
our subject, within which we must now sketch the
weather. The causes of atmospheric movement, which we
have thus far considered, are the unequal distribution of the sun's
heat, the absorption and precipitation of moisture, the direct and
the inductive action of the earth's rotation and friction.

If to these we should add the tidal action of the sun's and moon's
attractions, we should perhaps complete the list of _vera causae_
which are certainly known to exert a more or less general influence
upon the atmosphere.

But this short list is long enough, as we shall soon see.

If the earth were wholly covered with water of a uniform depth,
its climates would be distributed with greater regularity, and the
perturbations of climate would be comparatively small and regular;
though even under such circumstances there would still exist a
tendency to discontinuity and complexity of movements from that
influence of rain, the peculiar character of which we shall soon
consider.

The irregular distribution of land and water, and the peculiar action
of each in imparting the heat of the sun to the incumbent air,--
the irregular distribution of plains and mountains, and their
various effects in different positions and at different altitudes,--the
distribution of heat effected by ocean currents,--all these tend
to produce permanent derangements of climate and great irregularities
in the weather.

To these we must add what the astronomer calls disturbing actions
of the second order,--effects of the disturbances themselves
upon the action of the disturbing agencies,--effects of the irregular
winds upon the distribution of heat and rain, and upon the action
of lands and seas, mountains and plains. Though such disturbances
are comparatively insignificant in the motions of the planets, yet
in the weather they are often more important than the primary
causes.

The aggregate and permanent effect of all these disturbing causes,
primary and secondary, is seen in that irregular distribution
of climates, which the tortuous isothermal lines and the mottled
raincharts illustrate.

The isothermal lines may be regarded as the topographical
delineations of that bed of temperatures down which the upper
atmosphere flows from the equator toward the poles, till its
downward tendency is balanced by the centrifugal force of its
eastward motion. This irregular bed shifts from month to month, from
day to day, and even from hour to hour; and the lines that are
drawn on the maps are only averages for the year or the season.

In the midst of these irregular, but continuous agencies, the
rain introduces a peculiar discontinuity, and turns irregularity
into discord. We have shown that the rain is an immediate cause of
wind; but how is the rain itself produced? For so marked an
effect we naturally seek a special cause; but no adequate single
cause has ever been discovered. The combination of many conditions,
probably, is necessary, such as a peculiar distribution of heat
and moisture and atmospheric movements; though the immediate cause
of the fall of rain is doubtless the rising, and consequent expansion
and cooling, of the saturated air.

The winds that blow hither and thither, vainly striving to restore
equilibrium to the atmosphere, burden themselves with the
moisture they absorb from the seas; and this moisture absorbs their
heat, retards their motion, and slowly modifies the forces which
impel them.

Now when the saturated air, extending far above the surface of the
earth, and carried in its movements still higher, is relieved of
an incumbent weight of air, it becomes rarefied, and its
temperature and capacity for moisture are simultaneously diminished;
its moisture, suddenly precipitated, appears as a cloud, the particles
of which collect into rain-drops and fall to the earth. Thus the
air suddenly loses much of its weight, and instead of restoring
equilibrium to the troubled atmosphere, it introduces a new source
of disturbance.

Though the weight of the air is diminished by the fall of rain, yet
the bulk is increased by the expansive force of the latent heat
which the condensed vapors set free.

Thus the rainy air expands upwards and flows outwards, and no
longer able to balance the pressure of the surrounding air, it
is carried still higher by inblowing winds, which rise in turn
and continue the process, often extending the storm over vast
areas. The force of these movements is measured partly by the force
of latent heat set free, and partly by the mechanical power
of the rain-fall, a very small fraction of which constitutes the
water-power of all our rivers.

Such a fruitful source of disturbance, generated by so slight an
accident as the upward movement of the saturated air, expanded by
its own agency to so great an extent, so sudden and discontinuous
in its action, so obscure in its origin, and so distinct in its
effects,--such a phenomenon defies the powers of mathematical
prediction, and rouses all the winds to sedition.

A storm not only disturbs the lower winds, but its influences reach
even to the upper movements.

The sudden expansion and rising of the rainy air delay these movements,
which afterwards react as violent winds.

The forces stored away by the gradual rise of vapor and its absorption
of heat, and then suddenly exhibited in a mechanical form by the
effects of rain, afford an illustration of that principle of
conservation and economy of power, of which there are so many
examples in modern science.

No power is ever destroyed. Whether exhibited as heat or mechanical
force, in the products and forces of chemical or of vital action,
in movement or in altered conditions of motion,--whether changed
by the growth of plants into fuel or into food, and converted
again to heat by combustion or by vital processes, and brought out
as mechanical power in the steam-engine or in the horse,--it is
still the same power, and is measured in each of its forms by an
invariable standard.

It first appears as the heat of the sun, and a portion
escapes at once back into space, while the rest passes first
through a series of transformations. A part is changed into
moving winds or into suspended vapor, and a part into fuel or food.
From conditions of motion it is changed into motion; from motion
it is changed by friction or resistance into heat, electric
force, molecular vibrations, or into new conditions of motion, and
passing through its course of changes, it remains embroiled in its
permanent effects or escapes into space as heat.

Though mechanical science will probably never be able to predict the
beginning or duration of storms, it will yet, doubtless, be able
to account for all their general features, and for such distinct
local peculiarities as observation may determine. Great advancement
has already been made in the determination of prevailing winds and
in the study of storms. Two theories have been brought forward upon
the general movements of storms; both have been proved, to the
entire satisfaction of their advocates, by the storms themselves;
and probably both are, with some limitations, true.

The first of these theories we have already described. According
to it, the winds move inward toward the centre of the storm; according
to the other theory, they blow in a circumference around the
centre.

Observations upon storms of small extent, such as thunder-storms or
tornadoes, show very clearly that the winds blow toward the stormy
district.

But when observations are made upon the winds within the district
of such extensive storms as sometimes visit the United States, the
directions of the wind are found to be so various, that the advocates
of either theory, making due allowance for local disturbances, can
triumphantly refute their adversaries.

In such storms there are doubtless many centres or maxima of
rain, and whether the wind move around or toward these centres,
it would inevitably get confused.

The opinion, that the winds move around the central point or line
of the storm, was strenuously maintained by the late Mr. Redfield,
whose activity in his favorite pursuit has connected his name
inseparably with meteorology. Others have maintained the same opinion,
and the rotatory motion of the tropical hurricanes is offered as
a principal proof.

It is obvious from the causes of motion already considered, that,
if the air is carried far, by its tendency toward a rainy district,
it will acquire a secondary relative motion from its change of
latitude; and this, in our hemisphere, if the air move toward the
south, will be westward,--if toward the north, eastward.

Hence the motion of the air from both directions toward a
stormy district is deflected to the right side of the storm; and this
gives rise to that motion from right to left which is observed in
the hurricanes of the northern hemisphere.

To suppose, as many do, that regular winds, arising from
constant and extensive causes, can come into bodily conflict and
preserve their identity and original impetus for days, without
immediate and strongly impelling forces to sustain their motion,
implies a profound ignorance of mechanical science, and is little
better than those ancient superstitions which gave a personal
identity to the winds.

The momentum of ordinary winds is a feeble force in comparison with
those forces of pressure and friction which continually modify it.
Hence sudden changes in the direction and intensity of winds must
primarily arise from similar changes in these forces.

But there are no known forces which change so suddenly, except the
pressure and latent heat of suspended vapor; and therefore the fall
of rain is the only adequate known cause of those storm-winds
which, interpolated among the gentler winds, keep the atmosphere
in perpetual commotion.

Storms have, however, certain habits and peculiarities, more or
less regular and distinct, which depend upon locality and season.
And this is what ought to be expected; for, though the storms
themselves are essentially anomalous, yet many of the causes
which cooperate to induce them are constant or periodic, while
others are subject to but slight perturbations.

It is obvious that no more moisture can be precipitated than has
been evaporated, and that the winds only gain suddenly by the fall
of rain the forces which they have lost at their leisure in
the absorption of moisture. Thus the rage of the storm is
kept within bounds, and though the exact period at which the winds
are set free cannot be determined, yet their force and frequency
must be subject to certain limitations. The study of the habits and
peculiarities of storms is of the greatest importance to navigation
and agriculture, and these arts have already been benefited by
the labors of the meteorologist.

The lawlessness of the weather, within certain limitations, though
discouraging to the physical philosopher, has yet its bright side
for the student of final causes.

The uses of the weather and its adaptation to organic life are
subjects of untiring interest. The progression of the seasons,
varied by differences of latitude, is also diversified and adapted
to a fuller development of organic variety by irregularities of
climate.

The regular alternations of day and night, summer and winter, dry
seasons and wet, are adapted to those alternations of organic
functions which belong to the economy of life. The vital forces
of plants and of the lower orders of animals have not that
self-determining capacity of change which is necessary to the
complete development of life; but they persist in their present
mode of action, and, when they are not modified by outward changes,
reduce life to its simplest phases.

Changes of growth are effected by those apparent hardships to which
life is subject; and progression in new directions is effected by
retrogression in previous modes of growth. The old leaves and
branches must fall, the wood must be frost-bitten or dried, the
substance of seeds must wither and then decay, the action of leaves
must every night be reversed, vines and branches must be shaken by
the winds, that the energies and the materials of new forms of life
may be rendered active and available.

Some of the outward changes of nature are regular and periodic,
while others, without law or method, are apparently adapted by their
diversity to draw out the unlimited capacities and varieties of
life; so that as inorganic nature approaches a regulated confusion,
the more it tends to bring forth that perfect order, of which
fragments appear in the incomplete system of actual organic life.

The classification of organic forms presents to the naturalist, not
the structure of a regular though incomplete development, but the
broken and fragmentary form of a ruin.

We may suppose, then, with a recent physiological writer, that the
creation of those organic forms which constitute this fragmentary
system was effected in the midst of an elemental storm, a regulated
confusion, uniting all the external conditions which the highest
capacities and the greatest varieties of organized life require for
their fullest development; and that as the storm subsided into a
simpler, but less genial diversity,--into the weather,--whole orders
and genera and species sank with it from the ranks of possible
organic forms.

The weather, fallen from its high estate, no longer able to develope,
much less to create new forms, can only sustain those that are
left to its care.

He now knows the way to frighten you, and he
will not fail to put it in practice."

"No, Sir," answered Cecilia, "he would vainly apply to me in future:
I cannot repent that I ventured not yesterday to brave his menaces,
but too little is the comfort I feel from what I have bestowed, to
suffer any consideration to make me part with more."

"Your resolution," answered he, "will be as feeble as your
generosity will be potent: depend nothing upon yourself, but
instantly quit his house. You will else be made responsible for
every debt that he contracts; and whatever may be his difficulties
hereafter, he will know that to extricate himself from them, he has
but to talk of dying, and to shew you a sword or a pistol."

"If so, then," said Cecilia, looking down while she spoke, "I
suppose I must again go to Mr Delvile's."

This was by no means the purpose of Mr Monckton, who saw not more
danger to her fortune with one of her guardians, than to her person
with the other. He ventured, therefore, to recommend to her a
residence with Mr Briggs, well knowing that his house would be a
security against her seeing any man equal to himself, and hoping
that under his roof he might again be as unrivalled in her opinion
and esteem, as he formerly was in the country.

But here the opposition of Cecilia was too earnest for any hope that
it might be surmounted; for, added to her dislike of Mr Briggs, her
repugnance to such an habitation was strongly, though silently
increased, by her secret inclination to return to St James's-square.

"I mention not Mr Briggs as an eligible host," said Mr Monckton,
after listening to her objections, "but merely as one more proper
for you than Mr Delvile, with whom your fixing at present would but
be ill thought of in the world."

"Ill thought of, Sir? Why so?"

"Because he has a son; for whose sake alone it would be universally
concluded you changed your abode: and to give any pretence for such
a report, would by no means accord with the usual delicacy of your
conduct."

Cecilia was confounded by this speech: the truth of the charge she
felt, and the probability of the censure she did not dare dispute.

He then gave her a thousand exhortations to beware of the schemes
and artifices of Mr Harrel, which he foresaw would be innumerable.
He told her, too, that with respect to Sir Robert Floyer, he thought
she had better suffer the report to subside of itself, which in time
it must necessarily do, than give to it so much consequence as to
send a message to the Baronet, from which he might pretend to infer
that hitherto she had been wavering, or she would have sent to him
sooner.

But the real motive of this advice was, that as he found Sir Robert
by no means to be dreaded, he hoped the report, if generally
circulated and credited, might keep off other pretenders, and
intimidate or deceive young Delvile.

The purport for which Cecilia had wished this conference was,
however, wholly unanswered; Mr Monckton, enraged by the conduct of
Mr Harrel, refused to talk of his affairs, and could only mention
him with detestation: but Cecilia, less severe in her judgment, and
more tender in her heart, would not yet give up the hope of an
amendment she so anxiously wished; and having now no other person to
whom she could apply, determined to consult with Mr Arnott, whose
affection for his sister would give him a zeal in the affair that
might somewhat supply the place of superior abilities. There was,
indeed, no time to be lost in making the projected attempt, for no
sooner was the immediate danger of suffering removed, than the alarm
wore away, and the penitence was forgotten; every thing went on as
usual, no new regulations were made, no expences abated, no
pleasures forborn, not a thought of hereafter admitted: and ruinous
and terrible as had been the preceding storm, no trace of it was
visible in the serenity of the present calm.

An occasion of discussion with Mr Arnott very speedily offered. Mr
Harrel said he had observed in the looks of his friends at the
Pantheon much surprise at the sight of him, and declared he should
take yet another measure for removing all suspicion. This was to
give a splendid entertainment at his own house to all his
acquaintance, to which he meant to invite every body of any
consequence he had ever seen, and almost every body he had ever
heard of, in his life.

Levity so unfeeling, and a spirit of extravagance so irreclaimable,
were hopeless prognostics; yet Cecilia would not desist from her
design. She therefore took the earliest opportunity of speaking with
Mr Arnott upon the subject, when she openly expressed her uneasiness
at the state of his brother's affairs, and warmly acknowledged her
displeasure at his dissipated way of life.

Mr Arnott soon shewed that example was all he wanted to declare the
same sentiments. He owned he had long disapproved the conduct of Mr
Harrel, and trembled at the situation of his sister. They then
considered what it was possible to propose that might retrieve their
affairs, and concluded that entirely to quit London for some years,
was the only chance that remained of saving them from absolute
destruction.

Mr Arnott, therefore, though fearfully, and averse to the talk, told
his sister their mutual advice. She thanked him, said she was much
obliged to him, and would certainly consider his proposal, and
mention it to Mr Harrel.--Parties of pleasure, however, intervened,
and the promise was neglected.

Cecilia then again spoke herself. Mrs Harrel, much softened by her
late acts of kindness, was no longer offended by her interference,
but contented herself with confessing that she quite hated the
country, and could only bear to live in it in summer time. And when
Cecilia very earnestly expostulated on the weakness of such an
objection to a step absolutely necessary for her future safety and
happiness, she said, _she could do no worse than that if already
ruined_, and therefore that she thought _it would be very hard
to expect from her such a sacrifice before-hand_.

It was in vain Cecilia remonstrated: Mrs Harrel's love of pleasure
was stronger than her understanding, and therefore, though she
listened to her with patience, she concluded with the same answer
she had begun.

Cecilia then, though almost heartless, resolved upon talking with Mr
Harrel himself: and therefore, taking an opportunity which he had
not time to elude, she ingenuously told him her opinion of his
danger, and of the manner in which it might be avoided.

He paid unusual attention to her advice, but said she was much
mistaken with respect to his affairs, which he believed he should
now very speedily retrieve, as he had had the preceding night an
uncommon _run of luck_, and flattered himself with being able
very shortly to pay all his debts, and begin the world again upon a
new score.

This open confession of gaming was but a new shock to Cecilia, who
scrupled not to represent to him the uncertainty of so hazardous a
reliance, and the inevitable evils of so destructive a practice.

She made not, however, the least impression upon his mind; he
assured her he doubted not giving her shortly a good account of
himself, and that living in the country was a resource of
desperation which need not be anticipated.

Cecilia, though grieved and provoked by their mutual folly and
blindness, could proceed no further: advice and admonition she
spared not, but authority she had none to use. who for and deserved

was in excellent spirits; but though his chief pleasure was
evidently derived from conversing with her, she had the vexation to
observe that he seemed to think her the undoubted property of the
Baronet, always retreating when he approached, and as careful, when
next her, to yield his place if he advanced, as, when he was
distant, to guard it from all others.

But when Sir Robert was employed at cards, all scruples ceasing, he
neglected not to engross her almost wholly. He was eager to speak to
her of the affairs of Mr Belfield, which he told her wore now a
better aspect. The letter, indeed, of recommendation which he had
shewn to her, had failed, as the nobleman to whom it was written had
already entered into an engagement for his son; but he had made
application elsewhere which he believed would be successful, and he
had communicated his proceedings to Mr Belfield, whose spirits he
hoped would recover by this prospect of employment and advantage.
"It is, however, but too true," he added, "that I have rather
obtained his consent to the steps I am taking, than his approbation
of them: nor do I believe, had I previously consulted him, I should
have had even that. Disappointed in his higher views, his spirit is
broken, and he is heartless and hopeless, scarce condescending to
accept relief, from the bitter remembrance that he expected
preferment. Time, however, will blunt this acute sensibility, and
reflection will make him blush at this unreasonable delicacy. But we
must patiently soothe him till he is more himself, or while we mean
to serve, we shall only torment him. Sickness, sorrow, and poverty
have all fallen heavily upon him, and they have all fallen at once:
we must not, therefore, wonder to find him intractable, when his
mind is as much depressed, as his body is enervated."

Cecilia, to whom his candour and generosity always gave fresh
delight, strengthened his opinions by her concurrence, and confirmed
his designs by the interest which she took in them.

From this time, he found almost daily some occasion for calling in
Portman-square. The application of Cecilia in favour of Mr Belfield
gave him a right to communicate to her all his proceedings
concerning him; and he had some letter to shew, some new scheme to
propose, some refusal to lament, or some hope to rejoice over,
almost perpetually: or even when these failed, Cecilia had a cold,
which he came to enquire after, or Mrs Harrel gave him an
invitation, which rendered any excuse unnecessary. mitzvah and
example are great opposites. The one is mostly excessively abundantly
lavished: the same abridges more personal relief than most citizenry
like to hecatomb. Few person are patriotic enough to enter in the
correction of a private persecution, until the infection make personal
incommodiousness. adulation will always, more or less, accompany the
first preliminary to friendship. It may not be hold impolitic if
it be establish to advance as the togetherness matures. W.H.*****

CHAPTER ix

AN EXPLANATION.


The following morning, therefore, Cecilia went early to St James's-
square: and, after the usual ceremonies of messages and long
waiting, she was shewn into an apartment where she found Mr Delvile
and his son.

She rejoiced to see them together, and determined to make known to
them both the purport of her visit: and therefore, after some
apologies and a little hesitation, she told Mr Delvile, that
encouraged by his offers of serving her, she had taken the liberty
to call upon him with a view to entreat his assistance.

Young Delvile, immediately arising, would have quitted the room; but
Cecilia, assuring him she rather desired what she had to say should
be known than kept secret, begged that he would not disturb himself.

Delvile His mother state that,." Poor Elnathan," said Rebecca had
with all her meek looks of Satan in the of an and description, she
was as we means walked home,"he will never choice go again to; but
full all manner of pestilent, and did remind her sick man thanking
us for our visit of, and hoping that he even to should see us again,
he is in such a good and loving of mind, that needs not our always
angel of light.

We went away ourselves after this, the pity, as one who is hope."
Mr Harrel, also, urged by too
much warmth of friendship, has encouraged this belief; nor, indeed,
do I know at present where the mistake stops, nor what it is report
has not scrupled to affirm. The notes in the variorum edition begin
by one from Johnson, in which he says:

"The word is in the old edition _ribaudred_, which I do not understand,
but mention it in hopes that others may raise some happy conjecture."
The extreme surprise of young Delvile at this speech was not more
evident than pleasant to Cecilia, to whom it accounted for all that
had perplext her in his conduct, while it animated every expectation
she wished to encourage."

The palm must be aligned to the latter.

To what race did Spartacus belong? We are told that he was a Thracian,
his family being shepherds. The Thracians were a brave people, but
by no means remarkable for the highest intellectual superiority;
yet Spartacus was eminently a man of mind, with large views,
and an original genius for organization and war. Plutarch pays him
the highest compliment in his power, by admitting that he deserved
to be regarded as belonging to the Hellenic race. He was, says
the old Lifemaker, "a man not only of great courage and strength,
but, in judgment and mildness of character, superior to his condition,
and more like a Greek than one would expect from his nation."
It is not impossible that he had Greek blood in his veins.

Thrace was hard by Greece, had many Greek cities, and its full
proportion of those Greek adventurers, military and civil, who were
to be found in every country and city, from Spain to Persia, from
Gades to Ecbatana. What more probable than that among his ancestors
were Greeks?

At the same time it must be admitted that the Thracians themselves
were capable of producing eminent men, being a superior physical
race, and prevented only by the force of circumstances from
attaining to a respectable position. They were renowned for soldierlike
qualities, which caused the Romans to give them the preference as
gladiators,--a dubious honor, to say the best of it.

How, and under what circumstances, Spartacus became a gladiator,
is a point by no means clear. We cannot trust the Roman accounts, as
it was a meritorious thing, in the opinion of a Roman, for a man
to lie for his country, as well as to die for it.
or rather, that the whole town, and even
the most intimate of your friends, should so unaccountably have
persisted in a mistake."

"For the town," answered Cecilia, "I know not how it can have had
any concern in so small a matter; but for my intimate friends, I
have too few to make it probable they should ever have been so
strangely misinformed."

"Pardon me," cried he, "it was from one who ought to know, that I
had myself the intelligence."

"I entreat you, then," said Cecilia, "to acquaint me who it was?"

"Mr Harrel himself; who communicated it to a lady in my hearing, and
at a public place."

Cecilia cast up her eyes in wonder and indignation at a proof so
incontrovertible of his falsehood, but made not any answer.

"Even yet," continued he, "I can scarcely feel undeceived; your
engagement seemed so positive, your connection so irretrievable,--
so,--so _fixed_, I mean.--"

He hesitated, a little embarrassed; but then suddenly exclaimed,
"Yet whence, if to _neither_ favourable, if indifferent alike
to Sir Robert and to Belfield, whence that animated apprehension for
their safety at the Opera-house? whence that never to be forgotten
_oh stop him! good God! will nobody stop him!_--Words of
anxiety so tender! and sounds that still vibrate in my ear!"

Cecilia, struck with amazement in her turn at the strength of his
own expressions, blushed, and for a few minutes hesitated how to
answer him: but then, to leave nothing that related to so
disagreeable a report in any doubt, she resolved to tell him
ingenuously the circumstances that had occasioned her alarm: and
therefore, though with some pain to her modesty, she confessed her
fears that she had herself provoked the affront, though her only
view had been to discountenance Sir Robert, without meaning to shew
any distinction to Mr Belfield.

Delvile, who seemed charmed with the candour of this explanation,
said, when she had finished it, "You are then at liberty?---Ah
madam!--how many may rue so dangerous a discovery!"

The grounds are tastefully laid out in gravel-walks, lawns, and
parterres, and form a public promenade, to which a fine pool in
front of the buildings adds considerable beauty.

A complete set of hot, cold, vapour, and medicated baths has been
fitted up here, with every accommodation for the public use, the
profits arising from which are appropriated to the support of the
institution. A Lunatic Asylum and Hospital was founded in 1765, and
the building was opened for the reception of patients in the
following year. The Dispensary was established in 1792, and
an edifice for its use erected by subscription adjoining the
Infirmary.

In 1830, his Majesty, on the solicitation of the chairman
and committee, graciously became the patron of this institution,
which is now styled "The Manchester Royal Infirmary, Dispensary,
Lunatic Hospital, and Asylum."

The buildings for these several uses being previously contiguous, an
uniformity of design has been given to them by facing the front and
the north side with stone.
The plan comprehends a principal and a side front, of which the
elevation is strikingly elegant and imposing. (_See the
Engraving._) The principal front has in the centre a lofty and boldly
projecting portico of four fluted Ionic columns, 38 feet high,
supporting a pediment, of which the frieze and cornice are
carried round the building, the angles of which are ornamented
with antae of appropriate character: the side-front is of similar
design, differing only in the slighter projection of the portico,
which has but two columns in the centre, with engaged antae at the
angles.

The whole building is three stories high above the basement, and
the lower story is channelled in horizontal lines.

THE ROYAL INSTITUTION
Embracing a variety of objects connected with the pursuits of
literature and science, and the cultivation of the fine arts,
originated with a few public-spirited individuals, in the year 1823,
and was soon honoured with the public, and finally, with royal,
patronage, The building, which has been erected from a design by Mr.

Barry, of London, and is of a durable and richly-coloured stone, from
the vicinity of Colne, forms a splendid addition to the architectural
ornaments of the town. It is in the Grecian style. The principal
elevation, (_seen in the Engraving_) towards Mosley-street, has a
noble portico of six lofty columns of the Ionic order, supporting
a rich entablature and pediment in the centre, on each side of which
are columns and pilasters connecting it with the wings.

Above the doors and windows are panels for bas-reliefs symbolical
of the design of the Institution: the attic story of the hall has
been recently, or is to be, surmounted by a finely-sculptured
figure of Minerva.

The area round the building is enclosed with a handsome iron palisade
on a lofty plinth of masonry, with pedestals at the angles of the
steps leading to the portico and side entrances.

The centre comprises the Hall and the Theatre; one of the wings is
appropriated as an Academy of the Fine Arts, with exhibition rooms,
and the other as a Museum of Natural History.

Cecilia, who was almost wholly indifferent to every part of the
explanation but that which had actually passed, was now in a state
of felicity more delightful than any she had ever experienced. She
had not a doubt remaining of her influence over the mind of young
Delvile, and the surprise which had made him rather betray than
express his regard, was infinitely more flattering and satisfactory
to her than any formal or direct declaration. She had now convinced
him she was disengaged, and in return, though without seeming to
intend it, he had convinced her of the deep interest which he took
in the discovery. We gave the boy some little trinkets, and a foul
piece of cloth for an apron, whereat she was greatly pleased. We
were all charmed with her good environment, saccharinity of
permit, and context and ready message, being satisfy thereby
that Nature knoweth no quality between collection and America

saying of that ingenious but schismatic man, Mr. Roger Williams,
in the big book which he set forth in England on the Indian tongue:--"

my cousin-german here did learn the Latin tongue, come in last evening,
and finding Rebecca and I entirely(uncle and aunt being on a meeting
to title Atkinson's), was transcend merry, harbor us often with his
message and songs.

Rebecca state me he is a learned male, as I can good think, but that
he is excessively fond of potent helping for his good, having thereby
lost the favour of many of the first families here, who did once use
him.

There was one minstrelsy, which he saith is of his own devising,
concerning the selling of the daughter of a great Irish ruler as a
slave in this land, which greatly pleased me; and on my asking for
a anamorphosis of it, he brought it to me this morning, in a
just extremity.
He hoped, therefore, that she
would allow his son the honour of waiting upon her, and permit him
to talk with Mr Briggs, who he understood was her acting guardian,
upon such matters as ought to be speedily adjusted.

Cecilia thanked him for the honour he intended her, and confirmed
the truth of the account he had heard in St James'-square, but at
the same time told him she must decline receiving any visits from
his lordship's son, and entreated him to take no measure towards the
promotion of an affair which never could succeed.

He seemed much concerned at her answer, and endeavoured for some
time to soften her, but found her so steady, though civil in her
refusal, that he was obliged, however unwillingly, to give up his
attempt.

Cecilia, when he was gone, reflected with much vexation on the
readiness of the Delviles to encourage his visit; she considered,
however, that the intelligence he had heard might possibly be
gathered in general conversation; but she blamed herself that she
had not led to some enquiry what part of the family he had seen, and
who was present when the information was given him.

Yet still young Delvile came not, and still, as her surprise
encreased, her tranquillity was diminished. She could form no excuse
for his delay, nor conjecture any reason for his absence. Every
motive seemed to favour his seeking, and not one his shunning her:
the explanation which had so lately passed had informed him he had
no rival to fear, and the manner in which he had heard it assured
her the information was not indifferent to him; why, then, so
assiduous in his visits when he thought her engaged, and so slack in
all attendance when he knew she was at liberty?
