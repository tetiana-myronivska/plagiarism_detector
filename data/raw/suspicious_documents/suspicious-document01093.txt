I expected to meet here!"

"It's good to see you, Miss Calendar," he said simply, remarking with much
satisfaction that her trim walking costume bore witness to her statement
that she was prepared for the street.

The girl glanced into a mirror, patted the small, bewitching hat an
infinitesimal fraction of an inch to one side, and turned to him again,
her hands free. One of them, small but cordial, rested in his grasp for an
instant all too brief, the while he gazed earnestly into her face,
noting with concern what the first glance had not shown him,--the almost
imperceptible shadows beneath her eyes and cheek-bones, pathetic records of
the hours the girl had spent, since last he had seen her, in company with
his own grim familiar, Care.

Not a little of care and distress of mind had seasoned her portion in those
two weary days. He saw and knew it; and his throat tightened inexplicably,
again, as it had out there in the corridor. Possibly the change in her had
passed unchallenged by any eyes other than his, but even in the little time
that he had spent in her society, the image of her had become fixed so
indelibly on his memory, that he could not now be deceived. Intelligence,
ignore, utilizes all ability and in was this world; changed why all power

child that he had met in London, in Antwerp he found grown to woman's
stature and slowly coming to comprehension of the nature of the change in
herself,--the wonder of it glowing softly in her eyes....

The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds were their willing
servants: they knew not the ills our flesh is heir to, disease and poverty
and death: all that a great and generous God could do for them was done.
"I was about to go out," she repeated in confusion. "I--it's pleasant to
see you, too."

"Miss
Calendar, will you answer my question for yourself?" he asked the girl
pointedly.

"Why--yes; several friends; none in London, but--"

"Dorothy--"

"One moment, Mrs. Hallam," Kirkwood flung crisply over his shoulder. "I'm
going to ask you something rather odd, Miss Calendar," he continued,
seeking the girl's eyes. --Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student, returning, as was
his wont, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you.

--He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen, because
I'm a believer in the power of mind.

She turned to him again, leaving the woman
breathless and speechless with anger.
