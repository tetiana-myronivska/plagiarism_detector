.'So I was, but I am sure the bell rang too early.  I do wish you had
taken them, Alethea.'

'I am sorry you are vexed,' said Alethea, simply.

'What makes you think I am vexed?  I only thought you liked hearing
my class.'

They were by this time at the church door, and as they entered
Alethea blamed herself for feeling grieved, and Lily awoke to a sense
of her unreasonableness.  She longed to tell Alethea how sorry she
felt, but she had no opportunity, and she resolved to go to Broomhill
the next day to make her confession.  In the night, however, snow
began to fall, and the morning showed the February scene of thawing
snow and pouring rain.  Going out was impossible, both on that day
and the next.  Wednesday dawned fair and bright; but just after
breakfast Lily received a little note, with the intelligence that Mr.
Weston had arrived at Broomhill on Monday evening, and with his wife
and daughters was to set off that very day to make a visit to some
friends on the way to London.  Had not the weather been so bad,
Alethea said she should have come to take leave of her New Court
friends on Tuesday, but she could now only send this note to tell
them how sorry she was to go without seeing them, and to beg Emily to
send back a piece of music which she had lent to her.  The messenger
was Faith Longley, who was to accompany them, and who now was going
home to take leave of her mother, and would call again for the music
in a quarter of an hour.  THE BIG NOISE XV. JILL EXPLAINS Freddie

her" Ah! dashed with.
She resolved to
make up for her former neglect by double kindness, and determined
that, at any rate, Passion Week should be properly spent--she would
not once miss going to church.

But on Monday, when Emily proposed to ride to Devereux Castle, she
assented, only saying that they would return for evening service.
She took care to remind her sister when it was time to set out
homewards; but Emily was, as usual, so long in taking her leave that
it was too late to think of going to church when they set off.

About two miles from Beechcroft Lily saw a little figure in a gray
cloak trudging steadily along the road, and as she came nearer she
recognised Kezia Grey.  She stopped and asked the child what brought
her so far from home.

'I am going for the doctor, Miss,' said the child.

'Is your mother worse?' asked Lily.

'Mother is pretty well,' said Kezia; 'but it is for Agnes Eden, Miss-
-she is terrible bad.'

'Poor little Agnes!' exclaimed Lily.  'Why, she was at school
yesterday.'

'Yes, Miss, but she was taken bad last night.'

After a moment's consultation between the sisters, Kezia was told
that she might return home, and the servant who accompanied the Miss
Mohuns was sent to Raynham for the doctor.  The next afternoon Lily
was just setting out to inquire for Agnes when Lord Rotherwood
arrived at the New Court with his sister.  He wanted to show Florence
some of his favourite haunts at Beechcroft, and had brought her to
join his cousins in their walk.  A very pleasant expedition they
made, but it led them so far from home that the church bell was heard
pealing over the woods far in the distance.  Lily could not go to
Mrs. Eden's cottage, because she did not know the nature of Agnes's
complaint, and her aunt could not bear that Florence should go into
any house where there was illness.  In the course of the walk,
however, she met Kezia, on her way to the New Court, to ask for a
blister for Agnes, the doctor having advised Mrs. Eden to apply to
the Miss Mohuns for one, as it was wanted quickly, and it was too far
to send to Raynham.
