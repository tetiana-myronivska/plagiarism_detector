what a fermenting mass of things learnt and emotions experienced and
theories formed I've got to deal with, and how, in a sense, hopeless my

_--About the year 1594, Amurath III. dreamed that he saw a man of
prodigious stature, with one foot raised upon the Tower of Constantinople,
while the other reached over the Bosphorus, and rested on the Asiatic
shore. In one hand, the figure sustained the sun, while the other
held the moon. He struck his foot against the Tower of Constantinople,
the fall of which overthrew the great temple, and the imperial palace.
Amurath, being greatly discomfited by this dream, consulted his
wizard, who informed him, "that it was a warning sent by their
prophet Mahomet, who threatened the overthrow of their religion and
empire, unless Amurath engaged his whole force against the
Christians."

This interpretation had so much influence with the emperor, that
he vowed not to lay down his arms until he had utterly exterminated the
Christians.

TROUT FISHING.

(_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)

Sir,--I shall now sum up this _ticklish_ subject, by acquainting you with
three more methods of catching trout in Westmoreland.

_Flood-netting_.--A flood net is a small net with a semi-circular frame
at the mouth of it, from which projects a long handle. This is used
only when there are floods; the fisher draws it up the rivulets,
and every now and then pulls it up to look for his success.

Sometimes he nets a great many at a time, and especially if he wait the
arrival of the flood, because a large shoal mostly comes down with the
first torrents.

_Pod-netting_.--This derives its name from the habitation of the
trouts (the banks of the "becks") which are called "hods" or "holds" and
more frequently "pods," and this net therefore goes by these three
names. I have before described to you the situation generally of these
"_holds_" to be either in the ledge of some rock or stone in the
water, or under some bank reaching over the stream. This net is used
in fine weather, and when the water is "_clear as crystal_;" the
fisherman takes hold of the handles of the net,[4] and wades through
the stream as gently as possible, placing the net just at the side
of a trout's "hold," taking care to keep it as close to the bottom
as possible, to afford the trout no room for escape.

Then another with a long pole drives the trouts from the mouth of the
"_hold_," when they immediately dart into the net, and nothing remains
but to draw the net quickly up. This is a famous method of fishing. I
have been with parties when we have completely cleared the beck. We
went to "Carmony" in the spring of 1825, and caught an immense
quantity by fishing with the hand and pod. This brings to my
recollection an amusing circumstance, which I intend troubling you
with, though you may think it unworthy of notice. It was reported
in that year that there was a large quantity of trouts in the beck;
and I went at the recommendation of those who had seen a particularly
large one (when passing by) "basking" in the streams.Bladesover is, I am convinced, the clue to
almost all that is distinctively British and perplexing to the foreign
inquirer in England and the English-speaking peoples. Grasp firmly that
England was all Bladesover two hundred years ago; that it has had
Reform Acts indeed, and such--like changes of formula, but no essential
revolution since then; that all that is modern and different has come in
as a thing intruded or as a gloss upon this predominant formula, either
impertinently or apologetically; and you will perceive at once the
reasonableness, the necessity, of that snobbishness which is the
distinctive quality of English thought. Everybody who is not actually in
the shadow of a Bladesover is as it were perpetually seeking after
lost orientations. He was still lying very quietly, and as I knew I had
no chance with him then, I touched him gently with a twig and he moved
into his habitation. I then leaned over the bank, thrust in my arm,
touched his back, I felt his size, and was all caution.has A FROM._,)
