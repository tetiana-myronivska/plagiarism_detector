History of the United Netherlands, 1590(a)


CHAPTER XXI.

     Effect of the Assassination of Henry III.--Concentration of forces
     for the invasion of France--The Netherlands determine on striking a
     blow for freedom--Organization of a Dutch army--Stratagem to
     surprise the castle of Breda--Intrepidity and success of the
     enterprise.

The dagger of Jacques Clement had done much, and was likely to do
more, to change the face of Europe.  Another proof was afforded that
assassination had become a regular and recognised factor in the political
problems of the sixteenth century.  Another illustration was exhibited of
the importance of the individual--even although that individual was in
himself utterly despicable--to the working out of great historical
results.  It seemed that the murder of Henry III.--that forlorn
caricature of kingship and of manhood--was likely to prove eminently
beneficial to the cause of the Netherland commonwealth.  Five years
earlier, the murder of William the Silent had seemed to threaten its
very existence.

For Philip the Prudent, now that France was deprived of a head, conceived
that the time had arrived when he might himself assume the sovereignty of
that kingdom.  While a thing of straw, under the name of Charles X. and
shape of a Cardinal Bourbon, was set up to do battle with that living
sovereign and soldier, the heretic Bearnese, the Duke of Parma was
privately ordered to bend all his energies towards the conquest of the
realm in dispute, under pretence of assisting the Holy League.

Accordingly, early in the year 1590, Alexander concentrated a
considerable force on the French frontier in Artois and Hainault,
apparently threatening Bergen-op-Zoom and other cities in South Holland,
but in reality preparing to invade France.  The Duke of Mayenne, who had
assumed the title of lieutenant-general of that kingdom, had already
visited him at Brussels in order to arrange the plan of the campaign.

While these measures were in preparation, an opportunity was likely to be
afforded to the Netherlanders of striking a blow or two for liberty and
independence; now that all the force that possibly could be spared was to
be withdrawn by their oppressors and to be used for the subjugation of
their neighbours.  The question was whether there would be a statesman
and a soldier ready to make use of this golden opportunity.

There was a statesman ripe and able who, since the death of the Taciturn,
had been growing steadily in the estimation of his countrymen and who
already was paramount in the councils of the States-General.  There was a
soldier, still very young, who was possessed of the strongest hereditary
claims to the confidence and affection of the United Provinces and who
had been passing a studious youth in making himself worthy of his father
and his country.  Fortunately, too, the statesman and the soldier were
working most harmoniously together.  John of Olden-Barneveld, with his
great experience and vast and steady intellect, stood side by side with
young Maurice of Nassau at this important crisis in the history of the
new commonwealth.

At length the twig was becoming the tree--'tandem fit surculus arbor'--
according to the device assumed by the son of William the Silent after
his father's death.

The Netherlands had sore need of a practical soldier to contend with the
scientific and professional tyrants against whom they had so long been
struggling, and Maurice, although so young, was pre-eminently a practical
man.  He was no enthusiast; he was no poet.  He was at that period
certainly no politician.  Not often at the age of twenty has a man
devoted himself for years to pure mathematics for the purpose of saving
his country.  Yet this was Maurice's scheme.  Four years long and more,
when most other youths in his position and at that epoch would have been
alternating between frivolous pleasures and brilliant exploits in the
field, the young prince had spent laborious days and nights with the
learned Simon Stevinus of Bruges.  The scientific work which they
composed in common, the credit of which the master assigned to the pupil,
might have been more justly attributed perhaps to the professor than to
the prince, but it is certain that Maurice was an apt scholar.

In that country, ever held in existence by main human force against the
elements, the arts of engineering, hydrostatics and kindred branches were
of necessity much cultivated.  It was reserved for the young
mathematician to make them as potent against a human foe.

Moreover, there were symptoms that the military discipline, learning and
practical skill, which had almost made Spain the mistress of the world,
were sinking into decay.  Farnese, although still in the prime of life,
was broken in health, and there seemed no one fit to take the place of
himself and his lieutenants when they should be removed from the scene
where they had played.  " The small top bunch that appear like hard
emerald acrocarp?"" Yes. Well, that's the fastball's retreat!"" Oh!
oh!" cried Dodo, bury to susurration," I understand a snuff of
a buttocks and a dull needle beak lodge over the border!" This was
excessively much for Mrs. fastball, who fly off with a sound wish an angry
big spinning-wheel--if such a proper Protestant situation is always
angry; and there in the retreat were two tiny eggs, like black
attic." Come ahead by the fence and ticker," state Joe." She does n't like
to farewell the retreat much when it is toward period."" It's a sympathy
her mate is dead. How lonely she must be!"

said Dodo, who had a tough big intuition." I do not think her mate is
dead," said the doc;"he is simply staying away, after a Americanism of
his unit. The vertebrate whose retreat we understand there is called the
Ruby-throated thornbill, because he has a marking of glittering ruby-red
down under his feature, at the capital of his buttoned-up waistcoat that
barely shows any time shirt-front.

He bear a beautiful golden-green dress-coat, with its dark purplish tailcoat
deeply forked. His woman expression really lots like him, only she
has no ruby solitaire to accessory." Bold as this bird is in darting about
and chasing larger ones, he is less than four inches long--only about
the sizing of one of the hawk-moths that go out to provender, just as this
valiant pygmy lancer sheet the flowers for the night." These thornbill
populate on honey and very little worm, and dread the cold thus that they
spend the winter southward from Florida. But as soon as existent
geyser temperature comes, they distribute over the United States, E
of the plains, and Union yet to the astrakhan Dominion. They are the only

are more than a dozen same coin in the West, most of them nigh
the Mexican boundary of the United commonwealth." When the slider

and giving shrill bellow like the squeaking of hatchling mouse. The

Then the male goes off by himself and sulks. You may understand him

tiny insects, and when they have remained a big snap in her fruitage

the dampen yolk, as a baby does milk from its vessel."" I was wondering
this very morning," state Joe,"how the old bird was going to starve
her old monad when those two foodstuff concoct, without any officer to
activity her.

clothing rock, that appear more like a column than a flue. Small blackish

the doc." These are Chimney Swifts, usually name flue taste: and their
colour is like soot, to match the spot they populate in."" Are

appear like swallow, but as I think Olive state you formerly, the
Swifts are a family all by themselves.

This one lives in the eastern half of the people in summer, and travel
far Alabama for the winter. When he lives in a tame location, he chooses
a hollow yellowwood for his nesting place, as his ancestress always
did earlier there were any houses or chimneys.[Illustration: Chimney
Swift.]" The flying of the Swift is so rapid that at multiplication
it is almost impossible for the quickest receptor to precede him;
his wings are really weak, and almost as short as all the rest of
his body.The fair and pleasant city of Breda lies on the Merk, a slender stream,
navigable for small vessels, which finds its way to the sea through the
great canal of the Dintel.  It had been the property of the Princes of
Orange, Barons of Breda, and had passed with the other possessions of
the family to the house of Chalons-Nassau.  Henry of Nassau had, half a
century before, adorned and strengthened it by a splendid palace-fortress
which, surrounded by a deep and double moat, thoroughly commanded the
town.  A garrison of five companies of Italian infantry and one of
cavalry lay in this castle, which was under the command of Edward
Lanzavecchia, governor both of Breda and of the neighbouring
Gertruydenberg.

Breda was an important strategical position.  It was moreover the feudal
superior of a large number of adjacent villages as well as of the cities
Osterhout, Steenberg and Rosendaal.  It was obviously not more desirable
for Maurice of Nassau to recover his patrimonial city than it was for the
States-General to drive the Spaniards from so important a position!

In the month of February, 1590, Maurice, being then at the castle of
Voorn in Zeeland, received a secret visit from a boatman, Adrian van der
Berg by name, who lived at the village of Leur, eight or ten miles from
Breda, and who had long been in the habit of supplying the castle with
turf.  In the absence of woods and coal mines, the habitual fuel of the
country was furnished by those vast relics of the antediluvian forests
which abounded in the still partially submerged soil.  The skipper
represented that his vessel had passed so often into and out of the
castle as to be hardly liable to search by the guard on its entrance.
He suggested a stratagem by which it might be possible to surprise the
stronghold.

The prince approved of the scheme and immediately consulted with
Barneveld.  That statesman at once proposed, as a suitable man to
carry out the daring venture, Captain Charles de Heraugiere, a nobleman
of Cambray, who had been long in the service of the States, had
distinguished himself at Sluys and on other occasions, but who had been
implicated in Leicester's nefarious plot to gain possession of the city
of Leyden a few years before.  The Advocate expressed confidence that he
would be grateful for so signal an opportunity of retrieving a somewhat
damaged reputation.  Heraugiere, who was with his company in Voorn at the
moment, eagerly signified his desire to attempt the enterprise as soon as
the matter was communicated to him; avowing the deepest devotion to the
house of William the Silent and perfect willingness to sacrifice his
life, if necessary, in its cause and that of the country.  Philip Nassau,
cousin of Prince Maurice and brother of Lewis William, governor of
Gorcum, Dorcum, and Lowenstein Castle and colonel of a regiment of
cavalry, was also taken into the secret, as well as Count Hohenlo,
President Van der Myle and a few others; but a mystery was carefully
spread and maintained over the undertaking.

Heraugiere selected sixty-eight men, on whose personal daring and
patience he knew that he could rely, from the regiments of Philip Nassau
and of Famars, governor of the neighbouring city of Heusden, and from his
own company.  Besides himself, the officers to command the party were
captains Logier and Fervet, and lieutenant Matthew Held.  The names of
such devoted soldiers deserve to be commemorated and are still freshly
remembered by their countrymen.

On the 25th of February, Maurice and his staff went to Willemstad on the
Isle of Klundert, it having been given out on his departure from the
Hague that his destination was Dort.  On the same night at about eleven
o'clock, by the feeble light of a waning moon, Heraugiere and his band
came to the Swertsenburg ferry, as agreed upon, to meet the boatman.
They found neither him nor his vessel, and they wandered about half the
night, very cold, very indignant, much perplexed.  At last, on their way
back, they came upon the skipper at the village of Terheyde, who made the
extraordinary excuse that he had overslept himself and that he feared the
plot had been discovered.  It being too late to make any attempt that
night, a meeting was arranged for the following evening.  No suspicion of
treachery occurred to any of the party, although it became obvious that
the skipper had grown faint-hearted.  He did not come on the next night
to the appointed place but he sent two nephews, boatmen like himself,
whom he described as dare-devils.

On Monday night, the 26th of February, the seventy went on board the
vessel, which was apparently filled with blocks of turf, and packed
themselves closely in the hold.  They moved slowly during a little time
on their perilous voyage; for the winter wind, thick with fog and sleet,
blew directly down the river, bringing along with it huge blocks of ice
and scooping the water out of the dangerous shallows, so as to render the
vessel at any moment liable to be stranded.  At last the navigation
became impossible and they came to a standstill.  From Monday night till
Thursday morning those seventy Hollanders lay packed like herrings in the
hold of their little vessel, suffering from hunger, thirst, and deadly
cold; yet not one of them attempted to escape or murmured a wish to
abandon the enterprise.  Even when the third morning dawned there was no
better prospect of proceeding; for the remorseless east wind still blew a
gale against them, and the shoals which beset their path had become more
dangerous than ever.  It was, however, absolutely necessary to recruit
exhausted nature, unless the adventurers were to drop powerless on the
threshold when they should at last arrive at their destination.  In all
secrecy they went ashore at a lonely castle called Nordam, where they
remained to refresh themselves until about eleven at night, when one of
the boatmen came to them with the intelligence that the wind had changed
and was now blowing freshly in from the sea.  Yet the voyage of a few
leagues, on which they were embarked, lasted nearly two whole days
longer.  On Saturday afternoon they passed through the last sluice, and
at about three o'clock the last boom was shut behind them.  There was no
retreat possible for them now.  The seventy were to take the strong
castle and city of Breda or to lay down their lives, every man of them.
No quarter and short shrift--such was their certain destiny, should that
half-crippled, half-frozen little band not succeed in their task before
another sunrise.

They were now in the outer harbour and not far from the Watergate which
led into the inner castle-haven.  Presently an officer of the guard put
off in a skiff and came on board the vessel.  He held a little
conversation with the two boatmen, observed that the castle was--much
in want of full, took a survey of the turf with which the ship was
apparently laden, and then lounged into the little cabin.  Here he was
only separated by a sliding trap-door from the interior of the vessel.
Those inside could hear and see his every movement.  Had there been a
single cough or sneeze from within, the true character of the cargo,
then making its way into the castle, would have been discovered and
every man would within ten minutes have been butchered.  But the officer,
unsuspecting, soon took his departure, saying that he would send some men
to warp the vessel into the castle dock.

Meantime, as the adventurers were making their way slowly towards the
Watergate, they struck upon a hidden obstruction in the river and the
deeply laden vessel sprang a leak.  In a few minutes those inside were
sitting up to their knees in water--a circumstance which scarcely
improved their already sufficiently dismal condition.  The boatmen
vigorously plied the pumps to save the vessel from sinking outright;
a party of Italian soldiers soon arrived on the shore, and in the course
of a couple of hours they had laboriously dragged the concealed
Hollanders into the inner harbour and made their vessel fast, close to
the guard-house of the castle.

And now a crowd of all sorts came on board.  The winter nights had been
long and fearfully cold, and there was almost a dearth of fuel both in
town and fortress.  A gang of labourers set to work discharging the turf
from the vessel with such rapidity that the departing daylight began to
shine in upon the prisoners much sooner than they wished.  Moreover, the
thorough wetting, to which after all their other inconveniences they had
just been exposed in their narrow escape from foundering, had set the
whole party sneezing and coughing.  Never was a catarrh so sudden, so
universal, or so ill-timed.  Lieutenant Held, unable to control the
violence of his cough, drew his dagger and eagerly implored his next
neighbour to stab him to the heart, lest his infirmity should lead to the
discovery of the whole party.  But the calm and wary skipper who stood on
the deck instantly commanded his companion to work at the pump with as
much clatter as possible, assuring the persons present that the hold was
nearly full of water.  By this means the noise of the coughing was
effectually drowned.  Most thoroughly did the bold boatman deserve the
title of dare-devil, bestowed by his more fainthearted uncle.  Calmly
looking death in the face, he stood there quite at his ease, exchanging
jokes with his old acquaintances, chaffering with the eager purchasers of
peat shouting most noisy and superfluous orders to the one man who
composed his crew, doing his utmost, in short, to get rid of his
customers and to keep enough of the turf on board to conceal the
conspirators.

At last, when the case seemed almost desperate, he loudly declared that
sufficient had been unladen for that evening and that it was too dark
and he too tired for further work.  So, giving a handful of stivers among
the workmen, he bade them go ashore at once and have some beer and come
next morning for the rest of the cargo.  Fortunately, they accepted his
hospitable proposition and took their departure.  Only the servant of the
captain of the guard lingered behind, complaining that the turf was not
as good as usual and that his master would never be satisfied with it.

"Ah!"  returned the cool skipper, "the best part of the cargo is
underneath.  This is expressly reserved for the captain.  He
is sure to get enough of it to-morrow."

Thus admonished, the servant departed and the boatman was left to
himself.  His companion had gone on shore with secret orders to make the
best of his way to Prince Maurice, to inform him of the arrival of the
ship within the fortress, and of the important fact which they had just
learned, that Governor Lanzavecchia, who had heard rumours of some
projected enterprise and who suspected that the object aimed at was
Gertruydenberg, had suddenly taken his departure for that city, leaving
as his lieutenant his nephew Paolo, a raw lad quite incompetent to
provide for the safety of Breda.

A little before midnight, Captain Heraugiere made a brief address to his
comrades in the vessel, telling them that the hour for carrying out their
undertaking had at length arrived.  Retreat was impossible, defeat was
certain death, only in complete victory lay their own safety and a great
advantage for the commonwealth.  It was an honor to them to be selected
for such an enterprise.  To show cowardice now would be an eternal shame
for them, and he would be the man to strike dead with his own hand any
traitor or poltroon.  But if, as he doubted not, every one was prepared
to do his duty, their success was assured, and he was himself ready to
take the lead in confronting every danger.

He then divided the little band into two companies, one under himself to
attack the main guard-house, the other under Fervet to seize the arsenal
of the fortress.

Noiselessly they stole out of the ship where they had so long been
confined, and stood at last on the ground within the precincts of the
castle.  Heraugiere marched straight to the guard-house.

"Who goes there?"  cried a sentinel, hearing some movement in the
darkness.

"A friend," replied the captain, seizing him, by the throat, and
commanding him, if he valued his life, to keep silence except when
addressed and then to speak in a whisper.

"How many are there in the garrison?"  muttered Heraugiere.

"Three hundred and fifty," whispered the sentinel.

"How many?"  eagerly demanded the nearest followers, not hearing the
reply.

"He says there are but fifty of them," said Heraugiere, prudently
suppressing the three hundred, in order to encourage his comrades.

Quietly as they had made their approach, there was nevertheless a stir
in the guard-house.  The captain of the watch sprang into the courtyard.

"Who goes there?"  he demanded in his turn.

"A friend," again replied Heraugiere, striking him dead with a single
blow as he spoke.

Others emerged with torches.  Heraugiere was slightly wounded, but
succeeded, after a brief struggle, in killing a second assailant.  His
followers set upon the watch who retreated into the guard-house.
Heraugiere commanded his men to fire through the doors and windows, and
in a few minutes every one of the enemy lay dead.

It was not a moment for making prisoners or speaking of quarter.
Meantime Fervet and his band had not been idle.  The magazine-house of
the castle was seized, its defenders slain.  Young Lanzavecchia made a
sally from the palace, was wounded and driven back together with a few of
his adherents.

The rest of the garrison fled helter-skelter into the town.  Never had
the musketeers of Italy--for they all belonged to Spinola's famous
Sicilian Legion--behaved so badly.  They did not even take the precaution
to destroy the bridge between the castle and the town as they fled panic-
stricken before seventy Hollanders.  Instead of encouraging the burghers
to their support they spread dismay, as they ran, through every street.

Young Lanzavecchia, penned into a corner of the castle; began to parley;
hoping for a rally before a surrender should be necessary.  In the midst
of the negotiation and a couple of hours before dawn, Hohenlo; duly
apprised by the boatman, arrived with the vanguard of Maurice's troops
before the field-gate of the fort.  A vain attempt was made to force this
portal open, but the winter's ice had fixed it fast.  Hohenlo was obliged
to batter down the palisade near the water-gate and enter by the same
road through which the fatal turf-boat had passed.

Soon after he had marched into the town at the head of a strong
detachment, Prince Maurice himself arrived in great haste, attended by
Philip Nassau, the Admiral Justinus Nassau, Count Solms, Peter van der
Does, and Sir Francis Vere, and followed by another body of picked
troops; the musicians playing merrily that national air, then as now so
dear to Netherlanders--

                   "Wilhelmus van Nassouwen
                    Ben ick van Duytaem bloed."

The fight was over.  Some forty of the garrison had been killed, but not
a man of the attacking party.  The burgomaster sent a trumpet to the
prince asking permission to come to the castle to arrange a capitulation;
and before sunrise, the city and fortress of Breda had surrendered to the
authority of the States-General and of his Excellency.

The terms were moderate.  The plundering was commuted for the payment of
two months' wages to every soldier engaged in the affair.  Burghers who
might prefer to leave the city were allowed to do so with protection to
life, and property.  Those who were willing to remain loyal citizens were
not to be molested, in their consciences or their households, in regard
to religion.  The public exercise of Catholic rites was however suspended
until the States-General should make some universal provision on this
subject.

Subsequently, it must be allowed, the bargain of commutation proved a bad
one for the burghers.  Seventy men had in reality done the whole work,
but so many soldiers, belonging to the detachments who marched in after
the fortress had been taken, came forward to claim their months' wages
as to bring the whole amount required above one hundred thousand florins.
The Spaniards accordingly reproached Prince Maurice with having fined his
own patrimonial city more heavily than Alexander Farnese had mulcted
Antwerp, which had been made to pay but four hundred thousand florins,
a far less sum in proportion to the wealth and importance of the place.

Already the Prince of Parma, in the taking of Breda, saw verified his
predictions of the disasters about to fall on the Spanish interests in
the Netherlands, by reason of Philip's obstinate determination to
concentrate all his energies on the invasion of France.  Alexander had
been unable, in the midst of preparations for his French campaign, to
arrest this sudden capture, but his Italian blood was on fire at the
ignominy which had come upon the soldiership of his countrymen.  Five
companies of foot and one of horse-picked troops of Spain and Italy--had
surrendered a wealthy, populous town and a well-fortified castle to a
mud-scow, and had fled shrieking in dismay from the onset of seventy
frost-bitten Hollanders.

It was too late to save the town, but he could punish, as it deserved,
the pusillanimity of the garrison.

Three captains--one of them rejoicing in the martial name of Cesar
Guerra--were publicly beheaded in Brussels.  A fourth, Ventimiglia,
was degraded but allowed to escape with life, on account of his near
relationship to the Duke of Terranova, while Governor Lanzavecchia was
obliged to resign the command of Gertruydenberg.  The great commander
knew better than to encourage the yielding up of cities and fortresses
by a mistaken lenity to their unlucky defenders.

Prince Maurice sent off letters the same night announcing his success to
the States-General.  Hohenlo wrote pithily to Olden-Barneveld--"The
castle and town of Breda are ours, without a single man dead on our side.
The garrison made no resistance but ran distracted out of the town."

The church bells rang and bonfires blazed and cannon thundered in every
city in the United Provinces to commemorate this auspicious event.
Olden-Barneveld, too, whose part in arranging the scheme was known to
have been so valuable, received from the States-General a magnificent
gilded vase with sculptured representations of the various scenes in the
drama, and it is probable that not more unmingled satisfaction had been
caused by any one event of the war than by this surprise of Breda.

The capture of a single town, not of first-rate importance either, would
hardly seem too merit so minute a description as has been given in the
preceding pages.  But the event, with all its details, has been preserved
with singular vividness in Netherland story.  As an example of daring,
patience, and complete success, it has served to encourage the bold
spirits of every generation and will always inspire emulation in
patriotic hearts of every age and clime, while, as the first of a series
of audacious enterprises by which Dutch victories were to take the place
of a long procession of Spanish triumphs on the blood-stained soil of the
provinces, it merits, from its chronological position, a more than
ordinary attention.

In the course of the summer Prince Maurice, carrying out into practice
the lessons which he had so steadily been pondering, reduced the towns
and strong places of Heyl, Flemert, Elshout, Crevecoeur, Hayden,
Steenberg, Rosendaal, and Osterhout.  But his time, during the remainder
of the year 1590, was occupied with preparations for a campaign on an
extended scale and with certain foreign negotiations to which it will
soon be necessary to direct the reader's attention.


CHAPTER XXII.

     Struggle of the United Provinces against Philip of Spain--Progress
     of the Republic--Influence of Geographical position on the fate of
     the Netherlands--Contrast offered by America--Miserable state of the
     so--called "obedient" provinces--Prosperity of the Commonwealth--Its
     internal government--Tendency to provincialism--Quibbles of the
     English Members of the Council, Wilkes and Bodley--Exclusion of
     Olden-Barneveld from the State Council--Proposals of Philip for
     mediation with the United Provinces--The Provinces resolutely
     decline all proffers of intervention.

The United Provinces had now been engaged in unbroken civil war for a
quarter of a century.  It is, however, inaccurate to designate this great
struggle with tyranny as a civil war.  It was a war for independence,
maintained by almost the whole population of the United Provinces against
a foreigner, a despot, alien to their blood, ignorant of their language,
a hater of their race, a scorner of their religion, a trampler upon their
liberties, their laws, and institutions--a man who had publicly declared
that he would rather the whole nation were exterminated than permitted to
escape from subjection to the Church of Rome.  Liberty of speech, liberty
of the press, liberty of thought on political, religious, and social
questions existed within those Dutch pastures and Frisian swamps to a far
greater degree than in any other part of the world at that day; than in
very many regions of Christendom in our own time.  Personal slavery was
unknown.  In a large portion of their territory it had never existed.
The free Frisians, nearest blood-relations of, in this respect, the less
favoured Anglo-Saxons, had never bowed the knee to the feudal system, nor
worn nor caused to be worn the collar of the serf.  In the battles for
human liberty no nation has stood with cleaner hands before the great
tribunal, nor offered more spotless examples of patriotism to be emulated
in all succeeding ages, than the Netherlanders in their gigantic struggle
with Philip of Spain.  It was not a class struggling for their own
privileges, but trampling on their fellow-men in a lower scale of
humanity.  Kings and aristocrats sneered at the vulgar republic where
Hans Miller, Hans Baker, and Hans Brewer enjoyed political rights end
prated of a sovereignty other than that of long-descended races and of
anointed heads.  Yet the pikemen of Spain and the splendid cavalry and
musketeers of Italy and Burgundy, who were now beginning to show their
backs both behind entrenchments and in the open field to their republican
foes, could not deny the valour with which the battles of liberty were
fought; while Elizabeth of England, maintainer, if such ever were, of
hereditary sovereignty and hater of popular freedom, acknowledged that
for wisdom in council, dignity and adroitness in diplomatic debate, there
were none to surpass the plain burgher statesmen of the new republic.

And at least these Netherlanders were consistent with themselves.  They
had come to disbelieve in the mystery of kingcraft, in the divine
speciality of a few transitory mortals to direct the world's events and
to dictate laws to their fellow-creatures.  What they achieved was for
the common good of all.  They chose to live in an atmosphere of blood and
fire for generation after generation rather than flinch from their
struggle with despotism, for they knew that, cruel as the sea, it would
swallow them all at last in one common destruction if they faltered or
paused.  They fought for the liberty of all.  And it is for this reason
that the history of this great conflict deserved to be deeply pondered by
those who have the instinct of human freedom.  Had the Hollanders basely
sunk before the power of Spain, the proud history of England, France, and
Germany would have been written in far different terms.  The blood and
tears which the Netherlanders caused to flow in their own stormy days
have turned to blessings for remotest climes and ages.  A pusillanimous
peace, always possible at any period of their war, would have been hailed
with rapture by contemporary statesmen, whose names have vanished from
the world's memory; but would have sown with curses and misery the soil
of Europe for succeeding ages.  The territory of the Netherlands is
narrow and meagre.  It is but a slender kingdom now among the powers of
the earth.  The political grandeur of nations is determined by physical
causes almost as much as by moral ones.  Had the cataclysm which
separated the fortunate British islands from the mainland happened to
occur, instead, at a neighbouring point of the earth's crust; had the
Belgian, Dutch, German and Danish Netherland floated off as one island
into the sea, while that famous channel between two great rival nations
remained dry land, there would have been a different history of the
world.

But in the 16th century the history of one country was not an isolated
chapter of personages and events.  The history of the Netherlands is
history of liberty.  It was now combined with the English, now with
French, with German struggles for political and religious freedom, but it
is impossible to separate it from the one great complex which makes up
the last half of the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth
centuries.

At that day the Netherland republic was already becoming a power of
importance in the political family of Christendom.  If, in spite of her
geographical disadvantages, she achieved so much, how much vaster might
her power have grown, how much stronger through her example might popular
institutions throughout the world have become, and how much more pacific
the relations of European tribes, had nature been less niggard in her
gifts to the young commonwealth.  On the sea she was strong, for the
ocean is the best of frontiers; but on land her natural boundaries faded
vaguely away, without strong physical demarcations and with no sharply
defined limits of tongue, history or race.  Accident or human caprice
seemed to have divided German Highland from German Netherland; Belgic
Gaul from the rest of the Gallic realm.  And even from the slender body,
which an arbitrary destiny had set off for centuries into a separate
organism, tyranny and religious bigotry had just hewn another portion
away.  But the commonwealth was already too highly vitalized to permit
peaceful dismemberment.  Only the low organisms can live in all their
parts after violent separations.  The trunk remained, bleeding but alive
and vigorous, while the amputated portion lay for centuries in fossilized
impotence.

Never more plainly than in the history of this commonwealth was the
geographical law manifested by which the fate of nations is so deeply
influenced.  Courage, enterprise amounting almost to audacity, and a
determined will confronted for a long lapse of time the inexorable, and
permitted a great empire to germinate out of a few sand-banks held in
defiance of the ocean, and protected from human encroachments on the
interior only by the artificial barrier of custom-house and fort.

Thus foredoomed at birth, it must increase our admiration of human energy
and of the sustaining influence of municipal liberty that the republic,
even if transitory, should yet have girdled the earth with its
possessions and held for a considerable period so vast a portion
of the world in fee.

What a lesson to our transatlantic commonwealth, whom bountiful nature
had blessed at her birth beyond all the nations of history and seemed to
speed upon an unlimited career of freedom and peaceful prosperity, should
she be capable at the first alarm on her track to throw away her
inestimable advantages!  If all history is not a mockery and a fable,
she may be sure that the nation which deliberately carves itself in
pieces and, substitutes artificial boundaries for the natural and
historic ones, condemns itself either to extinction or to the lower life
of political insignificance and petty warfare, with the certain loss of
liberty and national independence at last.  Better a terrible struggle,
better the sacrifice of prosperity and happiness for years, than the
eternal setting of that great popular hope, the United American Republic.

I speak in this digression only of the relations of physical nature to
liberty and nationality, making no allusion to the equally stringent
moral laws which no people can violate and yet remain in health and
vigour.

Despite a quarter of a century of what is commonly termed civil war,
the United Netherlands were prosperous and full of life.  It was in the
provinces which had seceded from the union of Utrecht that there was
silence as of the grave, destitution, slavery, abject submission to a
foreign foe.  The leaders in the movement which had brought about the
scission of 1579--commonly called the 'Reconciliation'--enjoyed military
and civil posts under a foreign tyrant, but were poorly rewarded for
subserviency in fighting against their own brethren by contumely on the
part of their masters.  As for the mass of the people it would be
difficult to find a desolation more complete than that recorded of the
"obedient" provinces.  Even as six years before, wolves littered their
whelps in deserted farmhouses, cane-brake and thicket usurped the place
of cornfield and, orchard, robbers swarmed on the highways once thronged
by a most thriving population, nobles begged their bread in the streets
of cities whose merchants once entertained emperors and whose wealth and
traffic were the wonder of the world, while the Spanish viceroy formally
permitted the land in the agricultural districts to be occupied and
farmed by the first comer for his own benefit, until the vanished
proprietors of the soil should make their re-appearance.

"Administered without justice or policy," said a Netherlander who was
intensely loyal to the king and a most uncompromising Catholic, "eaten up
and abandoned for that purpose to the arbitrary will of foreigners who
suck the substance and marrow of the land without benefit to the king,
gnaw the obedient cities to the bones, and plunder the open defenceless
country at their pleasure, it may be imagined how much satisfaction these
provinces take in their condition.  Commerce and trade have ceased in a
country which traffic alone has peopled, for without it no human
habitation could be more miserable and poor than our land."--[Discours
du Seigneur de Champagny sur les affaires des Pays Bas, 21 Dec. 1589.
Bibl. de Bourgogne, MS. No. 12,962.]

Nothing could be more gloomy than the evils thus described by the
Netherland statesman and soldier, except the remedy which he suggested.
The obedient provinces, thus scourged and blasted for their obedience,
were not advised to improve their condition by joining hands with their
sister States, who had just constituted themselves by their noble
resistance to royal and ecclesiastical tyranny into a free and powerful
commonwealth.  On the contrary, two great sources of regeneration and
prosperity were indicated, but very different ones from those in which
the republic had sought and found her strength.  In the first place, it
was suggested as indispensable that the obedient provinces should have
more Jesuits and more Friars.  The mendicant orders should be summoned to
renewed exertions, and the king should be requested to send seminary
priests to every village in numbers proportionate to the population, who
should go about from house to house, counting the children, and seeing
that they learned their catechism if their parents did not teach them,
and, even in case they did, examining whether it was done thoroughly and
without deception.

In the second place it was laid down as important that the bishops should
confirm no one who had not been sufficiently catechized.  "And if the
mendicant orders," said Champagny, "are not numerous enough for these
catechizations, the Jesuits might charge themselves therewith, not more
and not less than the said mendicants, some of each being deputed to each
parish.  To this end it would be well if his Majesty should obtain from
the Pope a command to the Jesuits to this effect, since otherwise they
might not be willing to comply.  It should also be ordered that all
Jesuits, natives of these provinces, should return hither, instead of
wandering about in other regions as if their help were not so necessary
here."--[Ibid.]

It was also recommended that the mendicant friars should turn their
particular attention to Antwerp, and that one of them should preach in
French, another in German, another in English, every day at the opening
of the Exchange.

With these appliances it was thought that Antwerp would revive out of
its ruins and, despite the blockade of its river, renew its ancient
commercial glories.  Founded on the substantial rocks of mendicancy and
jesuitism, it might again triumph over its rapidly rising rival, the
heretic Amsterdam, which had no better basis for its grandeur than
religious and political liberty, and uncontrolled access to the ocean.

Such were the aspirations of a distinguished and loyal Netherlander for
the regeneration of his country.  Such were his opinions as to the true
sources of the wealth and greatness of nations.  Can we wonder that the
country fell to decay, or that this experienced, statesman and brave
soldier should himself, after not many years, seek to hide his
dishonoured head under the cowl of a monk?

The coast of the obedient provinces was thoroughly blockaded.  The United
Provinces commanded the sea, their cruisers, large and small, keeping
diligent watch off every port and estuary of the Flemish coast, so that
not a herringboat could enter without their permission.  Antwerp, when it
fell into the hands of the Spaniard, sank for ever from its proud
position.  The city which Venetians but lately had confessed with a sigh
to be superior in commercial grandeur to their own magnificent capital,
had ceased to be a seaport.  Shut in from the ocean by Flushing--firmly
held by an English garrison as one of the cautionary towns for the
Queen's loan--her world-wide commerce withered before men's eyes.  Her
population was dwindling to not much more than half its former numbers,
while Ghent, Bruges, and other cities were diminished by two-thirds.

On the other hand, the commerce and manufactures of the United Republic
had enormously augmented.  Its bitterest enemies bore witness to the
sagacity and success by which its political affairs were administered,
and to its vast superiority in this respect over the obedient provinces.
"The rebels are not ignorant of our condition," said Champagny, "they are
themselves governed with consummate wisdom, and they mock at those who
submit themselves to the Duke of Parma.  They are the more confirmed in
their rebellion, when they see how many are thronging from us to them,
complaining of such bad government, and that all take refuge in flight
who can from the misery and famine which it has caused throughout these
provinces!"  The industrial population had flowed from the southern
provinces into the north, in obedience to an irresistible law.  The
workers in iron, paper, silk, linen, lace, the makers of brocade,
tapestry, and satin, as well as of all the coarser fabrics, had fled from
the land of oppression to the land of liberty.  Never in the history of
civilisation had there been a more rapid development of human industry
than in Holland during these years of bloodiest warfare.  The towns were
filled to overflowing.  Amsterdam multiplied in wealth and population as
fast as Antwerp shrank.  Almost as much might be said of Middelburg,
Enkhuyzen, Horn, and many other cities.  It is the epoch to which the
greatest expansion of municipal architecture is traced.  Warehouses,
palaces, docks, arsenals, fortifications, dykes, splendid streets and
suburbs, were constructed on every side, and still there was not room for
the constantly increasing population, large numbers of which habitually
dwelt in the shipping.  For even of that narrow span of earth called the
province of Holland, one-third was then interior water, divided into five
considerable lakes, those of Harlem, Schermer, Beemster, Waert, and
Purmer.  The sea was kept out by a magnificent system of dykes under
the daily superintendence of a board of officers, called dyke-graves,
while the rain-water, which might otherwise have drowned the soil thus
painfully reclaimed, was pumped up by windmills and drained off through
sluices opening and closing with the movement of the tides.

The province of Zeeland was one vast "polder."  It was encircled by an
outer dyke of forty Dutch equal to one hundred and fifty English, miles
in extent, and traversed by many interior barriers.  The average cost of
dyke-building was sixty florins the rod of twelve feet, or 84,000 florins
the Dutch mile.  The total cost of the Zeeland dykes was estimated at
3,360,000 florins, besides the annual repairs.

But it was on the sea that the Netherlanders were really at home, and
they always felt it in their power--as their last resource against
foreign tyranny--to bury their land for ever in the ocean, and to seek a
new country at the ends of the earth.  It has always been difficult to
doom to political or personal slavery a nation accustomed to maritime
pursuits.  Familiarity with the boundless expanse of ocean, and the habit
of victoriously contending with the elements in their stormy strength,
would seem to inspire a consciousness in mankind of human dignity and
worth.  With the exception of Spain, the chief seafaring nations of the
world were already protestant.  The counter-league, which was to do
battle so strenuously with the Holy Confederacy, was essentially a
maritime league.  "All the maritime heretics of the world, since heresy
is best suited to navigators, will be banded together," said Champagny,
"and then woe to the Spanish Indies, which England and Holland are
already threatening."

The Netherlanders had been noted from earliest times for a free-spoken
and independent personal demeanour.  At this epoch they were taking the
lead of the whole world in marine adventure.  At least three thousand
vessels of between one hundred and four hundred tons, besides innumerable
doggers, busses, cromstevens, and similar craft used on the rivers and in
fisheries, were to be found in the United Provinces, and one thousand,
it was estimated, were annually built.

They traded to the Baltic regions for honey, wax, tallow, lumber, iron,
turpentine, hemp.  They brought from farthest Indies and from America all
the fabrics of ancient civilisation, all the newly discovered products of
a virgin soil, and dispensed them among the less industrious nations of
the earth.  Enterprise, led on and accompanied by science, was already
planning the boldest flights into the unknown yet made by mankind, and
it will soon be necessary to direct attention to those famous arctic
voyages, made by Hollanders in pursuit of the north-west passage to
Cathay, in which as much heroism, audacity, and scientific intelligence
were displayed as in later times have made so many men belonging to both
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race illustrious.  A people, engaged in
perennial conflict with a martial and sacerdotal despotism the most
powerful in the world, could yet spare enough from its superfluous
energies to confront the dangers of the polar oceans, and to bring back
treasures of science to enrich the world.

Such was the spirit of freedom.  Inspired by its blessed influence this
vigorous and inventive little commonwealth triumphed over all human, all
physical obstacles in its path.  It organised armies on new principles
to drive the most famous legions of history from its soil.  It built
navies to help rescue, at critical moments, the cause of England, of
Protestantism, of civil liberty, and even of French nationality.  More
than all, by its trade with its arch-enemy, the republic constantly
multiplied its resources for destroying his power and aggrandizing its
own.

The war navy of the United Provinces was a regular force of one hundred
ships--large at a period when a vessel of thirteen hundred tons was a
monster--together with an indefinite number of smaller craft, which could
be put into the public service on short notice?  In those days of close
quarters and light artillery a merchant ship was converted into a cruiser
by a very simple, process.  The navy was a self-supporting one, for it
was paid by the produce of convoy fees and licenses to trade.  It must be
confessed that a portion of these revenues savoured much of black-mail to
be levied on friend and foe; for the distinctions between, freebooter,
privateer, pirate, and legitimate sea-robber were not very closely drawn
in those early days of seafaring.

Prince Maurice of Nassau was lord high admiral, but he was obliged to
listen to the counsels of various provincial boards of admiralty, which
often impeded his action and interfered with his schemes.

It cannot be denied that the inherent vice of the Netherland polity was
already a tendency to decentralisation and provincialism.  The civil
institutions of the country, in their main characteristics, have been
frequently sketched in these pages.  At this period they had entered
almost completely into the forms which were destined to endure until the
commonwealth fell in the great crash of the French Revolution.  Their
beneficial effects were more visible now--sustained and bound together as
the nation was by the sense of a common danger, and by the consciousness
of its daily developing strength--than at a later day when prosperity and
luxury had blunted the fine instincts of patriotism.

The supreme power, after the deposition of Philip, and the refusal by
France and by England to accept the sovereignty of the provinces, was
definitely lodged in the States-General.  But the States-General did not
technically represent the, people.  Its members were not elected by the
people.  It was a body composed of, delegates from each provincial
assembly, of which there were now five: Holland, Zeeland, Friesland,
Utrecht, and Gelderland.  Each provincial assembly consisted again of
delegates, not from the inhabitants of the provinces, but from the
magistracies of the cities.  Those, magistracies, again, were not elected
by the citizens.  They elected themselves by renewing their own
vacancies, and were, in short, immortal corporations.  Thus, in final
analysis, the supreme power was distributed and localised among the
mayors and aldermen of a large number of cities, all independent alike
of the people below and of any central power above.

It is true that the nobles, as, a class, had a voice in the provincial
and, in the general assembly, both for themselves and as technical
representatives of the smaller towns and of the rural population.  But,
as a matter of fact, the influence of this caste had of late years very
rapidly diminished, through its decrease in numbers, and the far more
rapid increase in wealth and power of the commercial and manufacturing
classes.  Individual nobles were constantly employed in the military,
civil, and diplomatic service of the republic, but their body had ceased
to be a power.  It had been.  the policy of William the Silent to
increase the number of cities entitled to send deputies to the States;
for it was among the cities that his resistance to the tyranny of Spain,
and his efforts to obtain complete independence for his country, had been
mainly supported.  Many of the great nobles, as has been seen in these
pages, denounced the liberator and took sides with the tyrant.  Lamoral
Egmont had walked to the scaffold to which Philip had condemned him,
chanting a prayer for Philip's welfare.  Egmont's eldest son was now
foremost in the Spanish army, doing battle against his own country in
behalf of the tyrant who had taken his father's life.  Aremberg and
Ligny, Arachot, Chimay, Croy, Caprea, Montigny, and most of the great
patrician families of the Netherlands fought on the royal side.

The revolution which had saved the country from perdition and created the
great Netherland republic was a burgher revolution, and burgher statesmen
now controlled the State.  The burgher class of Europe is not the one
that has been foremost in the revolutionary movements of history,
or that has distinguished itself--especially in more modern times--
by a passionate love of liberty.  It is always easy to sneer at Hans
Miller and Hans Baker, and at the country where such plebeians are
powerful.  Yet the burghers played a prominent part in the great drama
which forms my theme, and there has rarely been seen a more solid or
powerful type of their class than the burgher statesman, John of Olden-
Barneveld, who, since the death of William the Silent and the departure
of Lord Leicester, had mainly guided the destinies of Holland.  Certainly
no soldier nor statesman who ever measured intellects with that potent
personage was apt to treat his genius otherwise than with profound
respect.

But it is difficult to form a logical theory of government except on the
fiction of divine right as a basis, unless the fact of popular
sovereignty, as expressed by a majority, be frankly accepted in spite of
philosophical objections.

In the Netherlands there was no king, and strictly speaking no people.
But this latter and fatal defect was not visible in the period of danger
and of contest.  The native magistrates of that age were singularly pure,
upright, and patriotic.  Of this there is no question whatever.  And the
people acquiesced cheerfully in their authority, not claiming a larger
representation than such as they virtually possessed in the multiple
power exercised over them, by men moving daily among them, often of
modest fortunes and of simple lives.  Two generations later, and in the
wilderness of Massachusetts, the early American colonists voluntarily
placed in the hands of their magistrates, few in number, unlimited
control of all the functions of government, and there was hardly an
instance known of an impure exercise of authority.  Yet out of that
simple kernel grew the least limited and most powerful democracy ever
known.

In the later days of Netherland history a different result became
visible, and with it came the ruin of the State.  The governing class, of
burgher origin, gradually separated itself from the rest of the citizens,
withdrew from commercial pursuits, lived on hereditary fortunes in the
exercise of functions which were likewise virtually hereditary, and so
became an oligarchy.  This result, together with the physical causes
already indicated, made the downfall of the commonwealth probable
whenever it should be attacked by an overwhelming force from without.

The States-General, however, at this epoch--although they had in a manner
usurped the sovereignty, which in the absence of a feudal lord really
belonged to the whole people, and had silently repossessed themselves of
those executive functions which they had themselves conferred upon the
state council--were at any rate without self-seeking ambition.  The
Hollanders, as a race, were not office seekers, but were singularly
docile to constituted authority, while their regents--as the municipal
magistrates were commonly called--were not very far removed above the
mass by birth or habitual occupation.  The republic was a social and
political fact, against which there was no violent antagonism either of
laws or manners, and the people, although not technically existing, in
reality was all in all.  In Netherland story the People is ever the true
hero.  It was an almost unnoticed but significant revolution--that by
which the state council was now virtually deprived of its authority.
During Leicester's rule it had been a most important college of
administration.  Since his resignation it had been entrusted by the
States-General with high executive functions, especially in war matters.
It was an assembly of learned counsellors appointed from the various
provinces for wisdom and experience, usually about eighteen in number,
and sworn in all things to be faithful to the whole republic.  The
allegiance of all was rendered to the nation.  Each individual member was
required to "forswear his native province in order to be true to the
generality."  They deliberated in common for the general good, and were
not hampered by instructions from the provincial diets, nor compelled to
refer to those diets for decision when important questions were at issue.
It was an independent executive committee for the whole republic.

But Leicester had made it unpopular.  His intrigues, in the name of
democracy, to obtain possession of sovereign power, to inflame the lower
classes against the municipal magistracies, and to excite the clergy to
claim a political influence to which they were not entitled and which was
most mischievous in its effects, had exposed the state council, with
which he had been in the habit of consulting, to suspicion.

The Queen of England, by virtue of her treaty had the right to appoint
two of her subjects to be members of the council.  The governor of her
auxiliary forces was also entitled to a seat there.  Since the
malpractices of Leicester and the danger to which the country had been,
subjected in consequence had been discovered, it was impossible that
there should be very kindly feeling toward England in the public mind,
however necessary a sincere alliance between the two countries was known
to be for the welfare of both.

The bickering of the two English councillors, Wilkes and Bodley,
and of the governor of the English contingent with the Hollanders,
was incessant.  The Englishmen went so far as to claim the right of
veto upon all measures passed by the council, but the States-General
indignantly replied that the matters deliberated and decided upon by that
board were their own affairs, not the state affairs of England.  The two
members and the military officer who together represented her Majesty
were entitled to participate in the deliberations and to vote with their
brother members.  For them to claim the right, however, at will to annul
the proceedings was an intolerable assumption, and could not be listened
to for a moment.  Certainly it would have been strange had two Dutchmen
undertaken to veto every measure passed by the Queen's council at
Richmond or Windsor, and it was difficult to say on what article of the
contract this extraordinary privilege was claimed by Englishmen at the
Hague.

Another cause of quarrel was the inability of the Englishmen to
understand the language in which the debates of the state council were
held.

According to a custom not entirely unexampled in parliamentary history
the members of assembly and council made use of their native tongue in
discussing the state affairs of their native land.  It was however
considered a grievance by the two English members that the Dutchmen
should speak Dutch, and it was demanded in the Queen's name that they
should employ some other language which a foreigner could more easily
understand.

The state council complained that even in war matters
it was not consulted, and that most important enterprises were undertaken
by Prince Maurice without its knowledge, and on advice of the Advocate
alone.  Doubtless this was true, and thus, most unfortunately, the
commonwealth was degraded to a confederacy instead of becoming an
incorporate federal State.  The members of the States-General--as it
has been seen were responsible only to their constituents, the separate
provinces.  They avowed allegiance, each to his own province, none to the
central government.  Moreover they were not representatives, but envoys,
appointed by petty provinces, bound by written orders, and obliged to
consult at every step with their sovereigns at home.  The Netherland
polity was thus stamped almost at its birth with a narrow provincialism:
Delay and hesitation thus necessarily engendered were overcome in the
days of danger by patriotic fervour.  The instinct of union for the
sake of the national existence was sufficiently strong, and the robust,
practical common sense of the people sufficiently enlightened to prevent
this weakness from degenerating into impotence so long as the war
pressure remained to mould them into a whole.  But a day was to come for
bitterly rueing this paralysis of the imperial instincts of the people,
this indefinite decentralisation of the national strength.

For the present, the legislative and executive body was the States-
General.  But the States-General were in reality the States provincial,
and the States provincial were the city municipalities, among which the
magistracies of Holland were preponderant.

Ere long it became impossible for an individual to resist the decrees of
the civic authorities.  In 1591, the States-General passed a resolution
by which these arrogant corporations virtually procured their exemption
from any process at the suit of a private person to be placed on record.
So far could the principle of sovereignty be pulverized.  City council
boards had become supreme.

It was naturally impossible during the long continuance of this great
struggle, that neutral nations should not be injuriously affected by it
in a variety of ways.  And as a matter of course neutral nations were
disposed to counsel peace.  Peace, peace; peace was the sigh of the
bystanders whose commerce was impeded, whose international relations.
were complicated, and whose own security was endangered in the course of
the bloody conflict.  It was however not very much the fashion of that
day for governments to obtrude advice upon each other; or to read to each
other moral lectures.  It was assumed that when the expense and sacrifice
of war had been incurred, it was for cause, and the discovery had not yet
been made that those not immediately interested in the fray were better
acquainted with its merits than, the combatants themselves, and were
moreover endued with, superhuman wisdom to see with perfect clearness
that future issue which to the parties themselves was concealed.

Cheap apothegms upon the blessings of peace and upon the expediency of
curbing the angry passions, uttered by the belligerents of yesterday to
the belligerents of to-day, did not then pass current for profound
wisdom.

Still the emperor Rudolph, abstaining for a time from his star-gazing,
had again thought proper to make a feeble attempt at intervention in
those sublunary matters which were supposed to be within his sphere.

It was perfectly well known that Philip was incapable of abating one jot
of his pretensions, and that to propose mediation to the United Provinces
was simply to request them, for the convenience of other powers, to
return to the slavery out of which, by the persistent efforts of a
quarter of a century, they had struggled.  Nevertheless it was formally
proposed to re-open those lukewarm fountains of diplomatic commonplace in
which healing had been sought during the peace negotiations of Cologne in
the year 1579.  But the States-General resolutely kept them sealed.  They
simply answered his imperial Majesty by a communication of certain
intercepted correspondence between--the King of Spain and his ambassador
at Vienna, San Clemente, through which it was satisfactorily established
that any negotiation would prove as gigantic a comedy on the part of
Spain as had been the memorable conferences at Ostend, by which the
invasion of England had been masked.

There never was a possibility of mediation or of compromise except by
complete submission on the part of the Netherlanders to Crown and Church.
Both in this, as well as in previous and subsequent attempts at
negotiations, the secret instructions of Philip forbade any real
concessions on his side.  He was always ready to negotiate, he was
especially anxious to obtain a suspension of arms from the rebels during
negotiation; but his agents were instructed to use great dexterity and
dissimulation in order that the proposal for such armistice, as well as
for negotiation at all, should appear to proceed, not from himself as was
the fact, but from the emperor as a neutral potentate.  The king
uniformly proposed three points; firstly, that the rebels should
reconvert themselves to the Catholic religion; secondly, that they should
return to their obedience to himself; thirdly, that they should pay the
expenses of the war.  Number three was, however, usually inserted in
order that, by conceding it subsequently, after much contestation, he
might appear conciliatory.  It was a vehicle of magnanimity towards men
grown insolent with temporary success.  Numbers one and two were
immutable.

Especially upon number one was concession impossible.  "The Catholic
religion is the first thing," said Philip, "and although the rebels do
not cease to insist that liberty of conscience should be granted them,
in order that they may preserve that which they have had during these
past years, this is never to be thought of in any event."  The king
always made free use of the terrible weapon which the Protestant princes
of Germany had placed in his hands.  For indeed if it were right that one
man, because possessed of hereditary power over millions of his fellow
creatures, should compel them all to accept the dogmas of Luther or of
Calvin because agreeable to himself, it was difficult to say why another
man, in a similarly elevated position, might not compel his subjects to
accept the creed of Trent, or the doctrines of Mahomet or Confucius.
The Netherlanders were fighting--even more than they knew-for liberty
of conscience, for equality of all religions; not for Moses, nor for
Melancthon; for Henry, Philip, or Pius; while Philip justly urged that no
prince in Christendom permitted license.  "Let them well understand,"
said his Majesty, "that since others who live in error, hold the opinion
that vassals are to conform to the religion of their master, it is
insufferable that it should be proposed to me that my vassals should have
a different religion from mine--and that too being the true religion,
proved by so many testimonies and miracles, while all others are
deception.  This must be arranged with the authority of the commissioners
of the emperor, since it is well understood by them that the vassal is
never to differ from the opinion of his master."  Certainly it was worth
an eighty years' war to drive such blasphemous madness as this out of
human heads, whether crowned or shaven.

There was likewise a diet held during the summer of this year, of the
circles of the empire nearest to the Netherlands--Westphalia, Cleves,
Juliers, and Saxony--from which commissioners were deputed both to
Brussels and to the Hague, to complain of the misfortunes suffered by
neutral and neighbouring nations in consequence of the civil war.

They took nothing by their mission to the Duke of Parma.  At the Hague
the deputies were heard on the 22nd August, 1590.  They complained to the
States-General of "brandschatting" on the border, of the holding of forts
beyond the lines, and of other invasions of neutral territory, of the
cruising of the war-vessels of the States off the shores and on the
rivers, and of their interference with lawful traders.  Threats were made
of forcible intervention and reprisals.

The united States replied on the 13th September.  Expressing deep regret
that neutral nations should suffer, they pronounced it to be impossible
but that some sparks from the great fire, now desolating their land,
should fly over into their neighbours' ground.  The States were fighting
the battle of liberty against slavery, in which the future generations of
Germany, as well as of the Netherlands were interested.  They were
combating that horrible institution, the Holy Inquisition.  They were
doing their best to strike down the universal monarchy of Spain, which
they described as a bloodthirsty, insatiable, insolent, absolute dominion
of Saracenic, Moorish Christians.  They warred with a system which placed
inquisitors on the seats of judges, which made it unlawful to read the
Scriptures, which violated all oaths, suppressed all civic freedom,
trampled, on all laws and customs, raised inordinate taxes by arbitrary
decree, and subjected high and low to indiscriminate murder.  Spain had
sworn the destruction of the provinces and their subjugation to her
absolute dominion, in order to carry out her scheme of universal empire.

These were the deeds and designs against which the States were waging
that war, concerning some inconvenient results of which their neighbours,
now happily neutral, were complaining.  But the cause of the States was
the cause of humanity itself.  This Saracenic, Moorish, universal
monarchy had been seen by Germany to murder, despoil, and trample upon
the Netherlands.  It had murdered millions of innocent Indians and
Granadians.  It had kept Naples and Milan in abject slavery.  It had
seized Portugal.  It had deliberately planned and attempted an accursed
invasion of England and Ireland.  It had overrun and plundered many
cities of the empire.  It had spread a web of secret intrigue about
Scotland.  At last it was sending great armies to conquer France and
snatch its crown.  Poor France now saw the plans of this Spanish tyranny
and bewailed her misery.  The subjects of her lawful king were ordered to
rise against him, on account of religion and conscience.  Such holy
pretexts were used by these Saracenic Christians in order to gain
possession of that kingdom.

For all these reasons, men should not reproach the inhabitants of the
Netherlands, because seeing the aims of this accursed tyranny, they had
set themselves to resist it.  It was contrary to reason to consider them
as disturbers of the general peace, or to hold them guilty of violating
their oaths or their duty to the laws of the holy empire.  The States-
General were sure that they had been hitherto faithful and loyal, and
they were resolved to continue in that path.

As members of the holy empire, in part--as of old they were considered to
be--they had rather the right to expect, instead of reproaches,
assistance against the enormous power and inhuman oppression of their
enemies.  They had demanded it heretofore by their ambassadors, and they
still continued to claim it.  They urged that, according to the laws of
the empire, all foreign soldiers, Spaniards, Saracens, and the like
should be driven out of the limits of the empire.  Through these means
the German Highland and the German Netherland might be restored once more
to their old friendship and unity, and might deal with each other again
in amity and commerce.

If, however, such requests could not be granted they at least begged his
electoral highness and the other dukes, lords, and states to put on the
deeds of Netherlanders in this laborious and heavy war the best
interpretation, in order that they might, with the better courage and
resolution, bear those inevitable burthens which were becoming daily
heavier in this task of resistance and self-protection; in order that the
provinces might not be utterly conquered, and serve, with their natural
resources and advantageous situation, as 'sedes et media belli' for the
destruction of neighbouring States and the building up of the
contemplated universal, absolute monarchy.

The United Provinces had been compelled by overpowering necessity to
take up arms.  That which had resulted was and remained in 'terminis
defensionis.'  Their object was to protect what belonged to them, to
recover that which by force or fraud had been taken from them.

In regard to excesses committed by their troops against neutral
inhabitants on the border, they expressed a strong regret, together with
a disposition to make all proper retribution and to cause all crimes to
be punished.

They alluded to the enormous sins of this nature practised by the enemy
against neutral soil.  How do path seems plunder most attractive to

Provinces themselves.

Thus did the States-General, respectfully but resolutely, decline all
proffers of intervention, which, as they were well aware, could only
enure to the benefit of the enemy.  Thus did they avoid being entrapped
into negotiations which could only prove the most lamentable of comedies.
