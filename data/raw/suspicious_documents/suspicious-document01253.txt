"Haven't an idea, Marigold," he answered, "Barney's, I should
imagine, that is, if he goes about with black ringlets falling
round his shoulders

"Barney?" echoed the detective. "Barney's as bald as I am.
Besides, if you saw his sheet, you'd realize that he has got into
the habit of wearing his hair short!"

He carefully rolled the strand of hair up, replaced it in its
paper and stowed it in his waistcoat pocket.

"It just shows how easily one is misled in a matter of this
kind," he went on. "Supposing Barney hadn't got himself nabbed,
supposing I hadn't been able to find out from Miss Mackwayte her
movements on the night previous to the murder, that strand of
hair might have led me on a fine wild goose chase!"

"But, damn it, Marigold," exclaimed the Chief, laughing, "you
haven't told us whose hair it is?"

"Why, Nur-el-Din's, of course!"

The smile froze on the Chief's lips, the laughter died out of his
eyes. Desmond was amazed at the change in the man. The languid
interest he had taken in the different details of the crime
vanished. Something seemed to tighten up suddenly in his face and
manner.

"Why Nur-el-Din?" he asked curtly.

Mr. Marigold glanced quickly at him. Desmond remarked that the
detective was sensible of the change too.

"Simply because Miss Mackwayte spent some time in the dancer's
dressing-room last night, sir," he replied quietly, "she probably
sat at her dressing-table and picked up this hair in hers or in
her veil or something and it dropped on the bed where one of
Master Barney's buckles caught it up."

He spoke carelessly but Desmond noticed that he kept a watchful
eye on the other.

The Chief did not answer. He seemed to have relapsed into the
preoccupied mood in which Desmond had found him that morning.

"I was going to suggest, sir," said Mr. There is a large class of
words which every body admits to be imitative of sounds,--such,
for example, as _bang, splash, crack_,--and Mr.
Wedgwood undertakes to show that their number and that of
their derivative applications is much larger than is ordinarily
supposed.

He confines himself almost wholly to European languages, but not
always to the particular class of etymologies which it is his
main object to trace out. Some of his explanations of words, not
based upon any real or assumed radical, but showing their gradual
passage toward their present forms and meanings, are among
the most valuable parts of the book.
As striking proofs of this, we refer our readers to Mr.
Wedgwood's treatment of the words _abide, abie, allow, danger,
and denizen_. When he differs from other authorities, it is never
inconsiderately or without examination. Now and then we think
his derivations are far-fetched, when simpler ones were lying
near his hand. He makes the Italian _balcone_ come from the
Persian _båia khaneh_, an upper chamber.

An upper chamber over a gate in the Persian caravanserais is still
called by that name, according to Rich.

(p. 97.)

Yet under the word _balk_ we find, "A hayloft is provincially
termed the _balks_, (Halliwell,) because situated among the
rafters. Hence also, probably, the Ital.

_balco_, or _pulcoy_ a scaffold; a loftlike erection supported
upon beams." As a _balcone_ is not an upper chamber, nor a
chamber over a gate, but is precisely "a loftlike erection
supported upon beams," it seems more reasonable to suppose it an
augmentative formed in the usual way from _balco_.

Mr. Wedgwood's derivation of barbican from _bala khaneh_ seems
to us more happy.

(Ducange refers the word to an Eastern source.)

He would also derive the Fr. _ébaucher_ from _balk_, though we
have a correlative form, _sbozzare_, in Italian, (old Sp. _esbozar_,
Port, _esboyar_, Diez,) with precisely the same meaning, and
from a root _bozzo_, which is related to a very different class
of words from _balk_.

So bewitched is Mr. Wedgwood with this word _balk_, that
he prefers to derive the Ital.

_valicam, varcare_, from it rather than from the Latin _varicare_.
We should think a deduction from the latter to the English
_walk_ altogether as probable.

Mr.

Wedgwood also inclines to seek the origin of _acquaint_ in the
Germ, _kund_, though we have all the intermediate steps between
it and the Mid. Lat. _adcognitare_.
Again, under _daunt_ he says, "Probably not directly from Lat.
_domare_, but from the Teutonic form _damp_, which is essentially
the same word." It may be plain that the Fr. _dompter_ (whence
_daunt_) is not directly from _domare_, but not so plain, as
it seems to us, that it is not directly from the frequentative
form domitare.

--"_Decoy_. Properly _duck-coy_, as pronounced by those who
are familiar with the thing itself. '_Decoys_, vulgarly
_duck-coys_.'--Sketch of the Fens, in Gardener's Chron. 1849.

Du. _koye_, cavea, septum, locus in quo greges stabulantur.--Kil.
_Kooi, konw, kevi_, a cage; _vogel-kooi_, a bird-cage, decoy,
apparatus for entrapping waterfowl.

Prov. E. _Coy_, a decoy for ducks, a coop for lobsters.

--Forby. The name was probably imported with the thing itself
from Holland to the fens." (p. 447.)

_Duck-coy_, we cannot help thinking, is an instance of a corruption
like _bag o' nails_ from _bacchanals_, for the sake of giving meaning
to a word not understood.

Decoys were and are used for other birds as well as ducks, and
_vogel-kooi_ in Dutch applies to all birds, (answering to our
trap-cage,) the special apparatus for ducks being an _eende-kooi_.

The French _coi_ adverbialized by the prefix _de_, and meaning
quietly, slyly, as a hunter who uses decoys must demean
himself, would seem a more likely original.

--_Andiron_ Mr. Wedgwood derives from Flem.
_wend-ijser_, turn-irons, because the spit rested upon them. But
the original meaning seems to have no reference to the spit.
The French _landier_ is plainly a corruption of the Mid. Lat.
_anderia_, by the absorption of the article (_l'andier_). This
gives us an earlier form _andier_, and the augmentative _andieron_
would be our word.

--_Baggage_.
We cannot think Mr. Wedgwood's derivation of this word from
_bague_ an improvement on that of Ducange from _baga_,
area.--_Coarse_ Mr. Wedgwood considers identical with
_course_,--that is, of course, ordinary. He finds a confirmation
of this in the old spelling. Old spelling is seldom a safe guide,
though we wonder that the archaic form _boorly_ did not
seem to him a sufficient authority for the common derivation of
_burly_.

If _coarse_ be not another form of _gross_, (Fr. _gros_, _grosse_,)
then there is no connection between _corn_ and _granum_, or
_horse_ and _ross_.--"_Cullion_. It. _Coglione_, a cullion, a
fool, a scoundrel, properly a dupe. See Cully. It. _cogionare_,
to deceive, to make a dupe of.... In the Venet. _coglionare_
becomes _cogionare_, as _vogia_ for _voglia_....

Hence E. to _cozen_, as It. _fregio_, frieze; _cugino_, cousin;
_prigione_, prison." (p. 387.) Under _cully_, to which Mr.
Wedgwood refers, he gives another etymology of _coglione_, and, we
think, a wrong one.

_Coglionare_ is itself a derivative form from _coglione_, and
the radical meaning is to be sought in _cogliere_, to gather, to
take in, to pluck.

Hence a _coglione_ is a sharper, one who takes in, plucks. _Cully_
and _gull_ (one who is taken in) must be referred to the same
source. Mr.

Wedgwood's derivation of _cozen_ is ingenious, and perhaps accounts
for the doubtful Germ, _kosen_, unless that word itself be the
original.

--"_To chaff_, in vulgar language to rally one, to chatter or talk
lightly.

From a representation of the inarticulate sounds made by
different kinds of animals uttering rapidly repeated cries. Du.
_keffen_, to yap, to bark, also to prattle, chatter, tattle.
Halma," etc. We think it demonstrable that _chaff_ is only a
variety of _chafe_, from Fr.

_écauffer_, retaining the broader sound of the _a_ from the older
form _chaufe_. So _gaby_, which Mr. Wedgwood (p.
84) would connect with _gäwisch_, (Fr.

_gauche_,) is derived immediately from O. Fr. _gabé_, (a
laughing-stock, a butt,) the participial form of _gaber_,
to make fun of, which would lead us to a very different
root.
(See the _Fabliaux, passim_.)--_Cress_. "Perhaps," says Mr.
Wedgwood, (p. 398,) "from the crunching sound of eating the crisp,
green herb." This is one of the instances in which he is lured
from the plain path by the Nixy _Onomatopoeia_.

The analogy between _cress_ and _grass_ flies in one's eyes; and,
perhaps, the more probable derivation of the latter is from the
root meaning to grow, rather than from that meaning to eat, unless,
indeed, the two be originally identical. The A. S. forms _coers_
and _goers_ are almost identical. The Fr. _cresson_, from It.
_crescione_, which Mr. Wedgwood cites, points in the direction
of _crescere_; and the O. Fr. _cressonage_, implying a verb
_cressoner_, means the right of _grazing_.--Under _dock_ Mr.
Wedgwood would seem (he does not make himself quite clear) to refer
It.

_doccia_ to a root analogous with _dyke_ and _ditch_. He cites
Prov. _doga_, which he translates by _bank_. Raynouard has only
"_dogua_, douve, creux, cavité," and refers to It. _doga_.
The primary meaning seems rather the hollow than the bank, though
this would matter little, as the same transference of meaning
may have taken place as in _dyke_ and _ditch_, But when Mr.
Wedgwood gives mill-_dam_ as the first meaning of the word _doccia_,
his wish seems to have stood godfather.

Diez establishes the derivation of _doccia_ from _ductus_; and
certainly the sense of a channel to lead (_ducere_) water in any
desired direction is satisfactory.

The derivative signification of _doccia_ (a gouge, a tool to make
channels with) coincides.

Moreover, we have the masculine form _doccio_, answering exactly
to the Sp. _ducho_ in _aguaducho_, the _o_ for _u_, as in _doge_
for _duce_, from the same root _ducere_. Another instance of Mr.
Wedgwood's preferring the bird in the bush is to be found in his
refusing to consider _dout_, to extinguish, (_do out_,) as analogous
to _don, _doff_, and _dup_. He would rather connect it with
_tödten, tuer_. He cites as allied words Bohemian _dusyti_, to
choke, to extinguish; Polish _dusic_, to choke, stifle, quell;
and so arrives at the English slang phrase, "_dowse_ the glim."
As we find several other German words in thieves' English, we have
little doubt that _dowse_ is nothing more than _thu' aus_, do
(thou) out, which would bring us back to our starting-point.

We have picked out a few instances in which we think Mr.
Wedgwood demonstrably mistaken, because they show the temptation
which is ever lying in wait to lead the theoretical etymologist
astray. Mr. Wedgwood sometimes seems to reverse the natural
order of things, and to reason backward from the simple to the
more complex.

He does not always respect the boundaries of legitimate deduction.

On the other hand, his case becomes very strong where he finds
relations of thought as well as of sound between whole classes of
words in different languages.

But it is very difficult to say how long ago instinctive imitation
ceased and other elements are to be admitted as operative.

We see words continually coming into vogue whose apparent
etymologies, if all historical data of their origin were lost,
would inevitably mislead. If we did not know, for example, the
occasion which added the word _chouse_ to the English language,
we have little doubt that the twofold analogy of form and
meaning would have led etymologists to the German _kosen_, (with
the very common softening of the _k_ to _ch_,) and that the
derivation would have been perfectly satisfactory to most
minds.--_Tantrums_ would look like a word of popular coinage, and
yet we find a respectable Old High German verb _tantarôn_, delirare,
(Graff, V. 437,) which may perhaps help us to make out the
etymology of _dander_, in our vulgar expression of "getting
one's dander up," which is equivalent to flying into a passion.

--_Jog_, in the sense of _going_, (to _jog_ along,) has a
vulgar look.

Richardson derives it from the same root with the other _jog_, which
means to shake, ("A.

S. _sceac-an_, to _shake_, or _shock_, or _shog_.")

_Shog_ has nothing whatever to do with shaking, unless when Nym
says to Pistol, "Will you _shog_ off?"

he may be said to have shaken him off. When the Tinker in
Beaumont and Fletcher's "Coxcomb" says, "Come, prithee, let's
_shog_ off," what possible allusion to shaking is there, except,
perhaps, to "shaking stumps"?

The first _jog_ and _shog_ are identical in meaning and
derivation, and may be traced, by whosoever chooses, to the Gothic
_tiuhan_, (Germ, _ziehen_,) and are therefore near of kin to our
_tug_.

_Togs_ and _toggery_ belong here also.

(The connecting link may be seen in the preterite form _zog_.) The
other _jog_ probably comes to us immediately from the French
_choquer_; and its frequentative _joggle_ answers to the German
_schutkeln_, It.

_cioccolare_. Whether they are all remotely from the same
radical is another question.

We only cited it as a monosyllabic word, having the air of being
formed by the imitative process, while its original _tiuhan_ makes
quite another impression.

--Had the word _ramose_ been a word of English slang-origin, (and
it might easily have been imported, like so many more foreign
phrases, by sailors,) we have as little doubt that a derivation of
it from the Spanish _vamos_ would have failed to convince the
majority of etymologists.

This word is a good example of the way in which the people
(and it is always the people, never the scholars, who succeed in
adding to the spoken language) proceed in naturalizing a foreign
term.

The accent has gone over to the last syllable, in accordance
with English usage in verbs of two syllables; and though the sharp
sound of the _s_ has been thus far retained, it is doubtful how
long it will maintain itself against a fancied analogy with the
grave sound of the same letter in such words as _inclose_ and
_suppose_.

--We should incline to think the slang verb _to mosey_ a mere
variety of form, and that its derivation from a certain absconding
Mr.

Moses (who broke the law of his great namesake through a blind
admiration of his example in spoiling the Egyptians) was only a new
instance of that tendency to mythologize which is as strong as ever
among the uneducated.

_Post, ergo propter_, is good people's-logic; and if an antecedent
be wanting, it will not be long before one is invented.

If we once admit the principle of _onomatopoeia_, the difficulty
remains of drawing the line which shall define the territory within
which those capable of judging would limit its operation.

Its boundary would be a movable one, like that of our own Confederacy.
Some students, from natural fineness of ear, would be quicker to
recognize resemblances of sound; others would trace family
likeness in spite of every disguise; others, whose exquisiteness
of perception was mental, would find the scent in faint analogies
of meaning, where the ordinary brain would be wholly at fault.

In the original genesis of language, also, we should infer the
influence of the same idiosyncrasies.

We were struck with this the other day in a story we heard of a
little boy, who, during a violent thunder-storm, asked his father
what that was out there,--all the while winking rapidly to explain
his meaning.

Had his vocabulary been more complete, he would have asked what
that _winking_ out there was.

The impression made upon him by the lightning was not the ordinary
one of brightness, (as in _blitz_, (?)

_éclair_, _fulmen_, _flash_,) but of the rapid alternations of
light and dark.

Had he been obliged to make a language for himself, like
the two unfortunate children on whom King Psarnmetichus made
his linguistic experiment, he would have christened the phenomenon
accordingly.

Mr.

Wedgwood has by no means carried out his theory fully even in
reference to the words contained in his first volume, nor does
the volume itself nearly exhaust the vocabulary of the letters it
includes (A to D).

Sometimes, where we should have expected him to apply his system,
he refrains, whether from caution or oversight it is not easy to
discover.

The word _cow_, which is commonly referred to an imitative radical,
he is provokingly reserved about; and under _chew_ he hints at no
relation between the name of the action and that of the capital
ruminant animal.

[a] Even where he has derived a word from an imitative radical, he
sometimes fails to carry the process on to some other where
it would seem equally applicable, sometimes pushes it too far.

For instance, "_Crag_. 1.

The neck, the throat.--Jam. Du. _kraeghe_, the throat; Pol.
_kark_, the nape, crag, neck; Bohem.

_krk_, the neck; Icel.
_krage_, Dan.

_krave_, the collar of a coat. The origin is an imitation of the
noise made by clearing the throat. Bohem. _krkati_, to belch,
_krcati_, to vomit; Pol. _krzakaé_, to hem, to hawk. The same
root gives rise to the Fr. _cracher_, to spit, and It.
_recere_, to vomit; E.

_reach_, to strain in vomiting; Icel. _hraki_, spittle; A. S.
_hrara_, cough, phlegm, the throat, jaws; G. _rachen_, the jaws."
(As _crag_ is not an English word, all this should have come under
the head of _craw_.) "_Crag_. 2. A rock. Gael. _creag_, a rock;
W. _careg_, a stone; _caregos_, pebbles." We do not see why the
rattling sound of stones should not give them a claim to the
same pedigree,--the name being afterwards transferred to the
larger mass, the reverse of which we see in the popular _rock_
for _stone_. Nay, as Mr. Wedgwood (_sub voce draff_, p.
482) assumes _rac_ (more properly _rk_) as the root, it would
answer equally well for _rock_ also.

Indeed, as the chief occupation of crags, and their only amusement,
in mountainous regions, is to pelt unwary passengers and hunters
of scenery with their _débris_, we might have _creag, quasi
caregos faciens sive dejiciens, sicut rupes a rumpere_. Indeed,
there is an analogous Sanscrit root, meaning _break, crack_. But
though Mr.

Wedgwood lets off this coughing, hawking, spitting, and otherwise
unpleasant old patriarch _Rac_ so easily in the case of the
foundling _Crag_, he has by no means done with him.
Stretched on the unfilial instrument of torture that bears his
name, he is made to confess the paternity of _draff_, and _dregs_,
and _dross_, and so many other uncleanly brats, that we feel
as if he ought to be nailed by the ear to the other side of the
same post on which Mr.
Carlyle has pilloried August _der starke_ forever. But we honestly
believe the old fellow to be belied, and that he is as guiltless
of them as of that weak-witted Hebrew _Raca_ who looks so
much like him in the face.

[Footnote a: An etymology of this kind would have been
particularly interesting in the hands of so learned and acute
a man as Mr. Wedgwood.
It would have afforded him a capital example of the fact
that considerable differences in the form and sound of words meaning
the same thing prove nothing against the onomatopoeic theory, but
merely that the same sound represents a different thing to different
ears.

L. _Boare, mugire_, E. _moo_; F.

"I'm sorry I can't," replied the other. "There must be only two
men in this secret, myself and the fellow who undertakes the
mission. Of course, it's not certain death. If you take this
thing on, you'll have a sporting chance for your life, but that's
all. It's going to be a desperate game played against a desperate
opponent. Now do you understand why I didn't want you to think I
was flattering you? You've got your head screwed on right, I
know, but I should hate to feel afterwards, if anything went
wrong, that you thought I had buttered you up in order to entice
you into taking the job on!"

Desmond took two or three deep puffs of his cigarette and dropped
it into the ash-tray.

"I'll see you!" he said.

The Chief grinned with delight.

"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "I knew you were my man!"


CHAPTER VII. NUR-EL-DIN

The love of romance is merely the, nobler form of curiosity. And
there was something in Desmond Okewood's Anglo-Irish parentage
that made him fiercely inquisitive after adventure. In him two
men were constantly warring, the Irishman, eager for romance yet
too indolent to go out in search of it, and the Englishman,
cautious yet intensely vital withal, courting danger for danger's
sake.

All his ill-humor of the morning at being snatched away from his
work in France had evaporated. In the Chief he now saw only the
magician who was about to unlock to him the realms of Adventure.
Desmond's eyes shone with excitement as the other, obviously
simmering with satisfaction, lit another cigarette and began to
speak.

"The British public, Okewood," he said, hitching his chair
closer, "would like to see espionage in this country rendered
impossible. Such an ideal state of things is, unfortunately out
of the question. Quite on the contrary, this country of ours is
honeycombed with spies. So it will ever be, as long as we have to
work with natural means: at present we have no caps of
invisibility or magician's carpets available.

"As we cannot hope to kill the danger, we do our best to scotch
it. Personally, my modest ambition is to make espionage as
difficult as possible for the enemy by knowing as many as
possible of his agents and their channels of communication, and
by keeping him happy with small results, to prevent him from
finding out the really important things, the disclosure of which
would inevitably compromise our national safety."

He paused and Desmond nodded.

"The extent of our business," the Chief resumed, "is so large,
the issues at stake so vital, that we at the top have to ignore
the non-essentials and stick to the essentials. he know

producing it.

in a lower voice.
