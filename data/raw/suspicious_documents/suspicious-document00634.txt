On the
borders of this ring it paused with an air of disappointment.  Then
entering it stood still, took off the hat, whose lopsided appearance
had given so strange an outline, and bowed four times in opposite
directions, when, as the face was turned towards the spectators,
invisible in the dark shadow, the lady recognised Peregrine
Oakshott.  She pressed the Doctor's arm, and they both stood still
watching the boy bathing his hand in the dew, and washing his face
with it, then kneeling on one knee, and clasping his hands, as he
cried aloud in a piteous chant--

"Fairy mother, fairy mother!  Oh, come, come and take me home!  My
very life is sore to me.  They all hate me!  My brothers and the
servants, every one of them.  And my father and tutor say I am
possessed with an evil spirit, and I am beaten daily, and more than
daily.  I can never, never get a good word from living soul!  This
is the second seven years, and Midsummer night!  Oh, bring the other
back again!  I'm weary, I'm weary!  The president was a tall, stout
man, with long grey whiskers. Though married, he led a very
loose life, and his wife did the same, so they did not stand in
each other's way. This morning he had received a note from a Swiss
girl, who had formerly been a governess in his house, and who was
now on her way from South Russia to St. Petersburg. She wrote that
she would wait for him between five and six p.m. in the Hotel
Italia.

This made him wish to begin and get through the sitting as soon as
possible, so as to have time to call before six p.m. on the little
red-haired Clara Vasilievna, with whom he had begun a romance in
the country last summer.

He went into a private room, latched the door, took a pair of dumb-bells
out of a cupboard, moved his arms 20 times upwards, downwards,
forwards, and sideways, then holding the dumb-bells above his head,
lightly bent his knees three times.

"Nothing keeps one going like a cold bath and exercise," he said,
feeling the biceps of his right arm with his left hand, on the third
finger of which he wore a gold ring.

He had still to do the moulinee movement (for he always went through
those two exercises before a long sitting), when there was a pull
at the door.

The president quickly put away the dumb-bells and opened the door,
saying, "I beg your pardon."

One of the members, a high-shouldered, discontented-looking man,
with gold spectacles, came into the room. "Matthew Nikitich has again
not come," he said, in a dissatisfied tone.

"Not yet?" said the president, putting on his uniform. "He is always
late."
"It is extraordinary. He ought to be ashamed of himself," said the
member, angrily, and taking out a cigarette.

This member, a very precise man, had had an unpleasant encounter with
his wife in the morning, because she had spent her allowance
before the end of the month, and had asked him to give her some
money in advance, but he would not give way to her, and they
had a quarrel. The wife told him that if he were going to behave
so, he need not expect any dinner; there would be no dinner for
him at home.

At this point he left, fearing that she might carry out her threat,
for anything might be expected from her. "This comes of living a
good, moral life," he thought, looking at the beaming, healthy,
cheerful, and kindly president, who, with elbows far apart, was
smoothing his thick grey whiskers with his fine white hands over the
embroidered collar of his uniform. "He is always contented and
merry while I am suffering."

The secretary came in and brought some document.

"Thanks, very much," said the president, lighting a cigarette.
"Which case shall we take first, then?"

"The poisoning case, I should say," answered the secretary, with
indifference.

"All right; the poisoning case let it be," said the president, thinking
that he could get this case over by four o'clock, and then go away.

"And Matthew Nikitich; has he come?"
"Not yet."

"And Breve?"
"He is here," replied the secretary.

"Then if you see him, please tell him that we begin with the
poisoning case." Breve was the public prosecutor, who was to read
the indictment in this case.

In the corridor the secretary met Breve, who, with up lifted
shoulders, a portfolio under one arm, the other swinging with the
palm turned to the front, was hurrying along the corridor, clattering
with his heels.

"Michael Petrovitch wants to know if you are ready?" the
secretary asked.

"Of course; I am always ready," said the public prosecutor.

"What are we taking first?"
"The poisoning case."
"That's quite right," said the public prosecutor, but did not think
it at all right.

He had spent the night in a hotel playing cards with a friend who
was giving a farewell party.

Up to five in the morning they played and drank, so he had no time
to look at this poisoning case, and meant to run it through now.
The secretary, happening to know this, advised the president
to begin with the poisoning case. The secretary was a Liberal,
even a Radical, in opinion.

Breve was a Conservative; the secretary disliked him, and envied him
his position.

"Well, and how about the Skoptzy?" [a religious sect] asked the
secretary.

"I have already said that I cannot do it without witnesses, and so I
shall say to the Court."

"Dear me, what does it matter?"
"I cannot do it," said Breve; and, waving his arm, he ran into his
private room.

He was putting off the case of the Skoptzy on account of the absence
of a very unimportant witness, his real reason being that if they
were tried by an educated jury they might possibly be acquitted.

By an agreement with the president this case was to be tried in the
coming session at a provincial town, where there would be more
peasants, and, therefore, more chances of conviction.

The movement in the corridor increased. The people crowded most
at the doors of the Civil Court, in which the case that the dignified
man talked about was being heard.

An interval in the proceeding occurred, and the old woman came
out of the court, whose property that genius of an advocate had
found means of getting for his client, a person versed in law who
had no right to it whatever. The judges knew all about the case,
and the advocate and his client knew it better still, but the move
they had invented was such that it was impossible not to take the
old woman's property and not to hand it over to the person versed
in law.

The old woman was stout, well dressed, and had enormous flowers on
her bonnet; she stopped as she came out of the door, and spreading
out her short fat arms and turning to her advocate, she kept
repeating.

"What does it all mean? just fancy!"
The advocate was looking at the flowers in her bonnet, and evidently
not listening to her, but considering some question or
other.

Next to the old woman, out of the door of the Civil Court, his broad,
starched shirt front glistening from under his low-cut waistcoat,
with a self-satisfied look on his face, came the celebrated advocate
who had managed to arrange matters so that the old woman lost all
she had, and the person versed in the law received more than 100,000
roubles.

The advocate passed close to the old woman, and, feeling all eyes
directed towards him, his whole bearing seemed to say: "No
expressions of deference are required."

CHAPTER VII.

THE OFFICIALS OF THE COURT.

At last Matthew Nikitich also arrived, and the usher, a thin man,
with a long neck and a kind of sideways walk, his nether lip
protruding to one side, which made him resemble a turkey, came into
the jurymen's room.

This usher was an honest man, and had a university education, but
could not keep a place for any length of time, as he was subject
to fits of drunkenness. Three months before a certain countess, who
patronised his wife, had found him this place, and he was very
pleased to have kept it so long.

"Well, sirs, is everybody here?" he asked, putting his pince-nez on
his nose, and looking round.

"Everybody, I think," said the jolly merchant.

"All right; we'll soon see." And, taking a list from his pocket, he
began calling out the names, looking at the men, sometimes through
and sometimes over his pince-nez.

"Councillor of State, [grades such as this are common in Russia,
and mean very little] J. M. Nikiforoff!"

"I am he," said the dignified-looking man, well versed in the habits
of the law court.

"Ivan Semionovitch Ivanoff,
   retired colonel!"
"Here!" replied a thin man, in
   the uniform of a retired officer.

"Merchant of the Second Guild, Peter Baklasheff!"

"Here we are, ready!" said the good-humoured merchant, with a
broad smile.

"Lieutenant of the Guards, Prince Dmitri Nekhludoff!"
"I am he," answered Nekhludoff.

The usher bowed to him, looking over his pince-nez, politely and
pleasantly, as if wishing to distinguish him from the others.

"Captain Youri Demitrievitch-Dantchenko, merchant; Grigori
Euphimitch Kouleshoff," etc. All but two were present.

"Now please to come to the court, gentlemen," said the usher, pointing
to the door, with an amiable wave of his hand.

All moved towards the door, pausing to let each other pass. Then
they went through the corridor into the court.

The court was a large, long room. At one end there was a raised
platform, with three steps leading up to it, on which stood
a table, covered with a green cloth trimmed with a fringe of a
darker shade. At the table were placed three arm-chairs, with
high-carved oak backs; on the wall behind them hung a full-length,
brightly-coloured portrait of the Emperor in uniform and ribbon,
with one foot in advance, and holding a sword.

In the right corner hung a case, with an image of Christ crowned with
thorns, and beneath it stood a lectern, and on the same side the
prosecuting attorney's desk.

On the left, opposite the desk, was the secretary's table, and in
front of it, nearer the public, an oak grating, with the prisoners'
bench, as yet unoccupied, behind it.

Besides all this, there were on the right side of the platform
high-backed ashwood chairs for the jury, and on the floor below
tables for the advocates.

All this was in the front part of the court, divided from the back
by a grating.

The back was all taken up by seats in tiers. Sitting on the front
seats were four women, either servant or factory girls, and two
working men, evidently overawed by the grandeur of the room, and
not venturing to speak above a whisper.

Soon after the jury had come in the usher entered, with his sideward
gait, and stepping to the front, called out in a loud voice, as
if he meant to frighten those present, "The Court is coming!"

Every one got up as the members stepped on to the platform. Among
them the president, with his muscles and fine whiskers.

Next came the gloomy member of the Court, who was now more gloomy than
ever, having met his brother-in-law, who informed him that he
had just called in to see his sister (the member's wife), and that
she had told him that there would be no dinner there.

"So that, evidently, we shall have to call in at a cook shop," the
brother-in-law added, laughing.

"It is not at all funny," said the gloomy member, and became gloomier
still.

Then at last came the third member of the Court, the same Matthew
Nikitich, who was always late. He was a bearded man, with large,
round, kindly eyes.

He was suffering from a catarrh of the stomach, and, according to his
doctor's advice, he had begun trying a new treatment, and this had
kept him at home longer than usual.

Now, as he was ascending the platform, he had a pensive air. He was
in the habit of making guesses in answer to all sorts of
self-put questions by different curious means.

Just now he had asked whether the new treatment would be beneficial,
and had decided that it would cure his catarrh if the number of steps
from the door to his chair would divide by three. He made 26 steps,
but managed to get in a 27th just by his chair.

The figures of the president and the members in their uniforms, with
gold-embroidered collars, looked very imposing.

They seemed to feel this themselves, and, as if overpowered by their
own grandeur, hurriedly sat down on the high backed chairs behind
the table with the green cloth, on which were a triangular article
with an eagle at the top, two glass vases--something like those in
which sweetmeats are kept in refreshment rooms--an inkstand, pens,
clean paper, and good, newly-cut pencils of different kinds.

The public prosecutor came in with the judges. With his portfolio under
one arm, and swinging the other, he hurriedly walked to his seat near
the window, and was instantly absorbed in reading and looking through
the papers, not wasting a single moment, in hope of being ready
when the business commenced. He had been public prosecutor but a
short time, and had only prosecuted four times before this. He was
very ambitious, and had firmly made up his mind to get on, and therefore
thought it necessary to get a conviction whenever he prosecuted.
He knew the chief facts of the poisoning case, and had already formed
a plan of action. He only wanted to copy out a few points which he
required.

The secretary sat on the opposite side of the platform, and, having
got ready all the papers he might want, was looking through an
article, prohibited by the censor, which he had procured and read
the day before.

He was anxious to have a talk about this article with the bearded
member, who shared his views, but wanted to look through it once
more before doing so.

CHAPTER VIII.

SWEARING IN THE JURY.

The president, having looked through some papers and put a few questions
to the usher and the secretary, gave the order for the prisoners to
be brought in.

The door behind the grating was instantly opened, and two gendarmes,
with caps on their heads, and holding naked swords in their hands,
came in, followed by the prisoners, a red-haired, freckled man,
and two women.

The man wore a prison cloak, which was too long and too wide for
him. He stuck out his thumbs, and held his arms close to his
sides, thus keeping the sleeves, which were also too long, from
slipping over his hands. Without looking at the judges he gazed
steadfastly at the form, and passing to the other side of it, he sat
down carefully at the very edge, leaving plenty of room for the
others.

He fixed his eyes on the president, and began moving the muscles
of his cheeks, as if whispering something.

The woman who came next was also dressed in a prison cloak, and had
a prison kerchief round her head.

She had a sallow complexion, no eyebrows or lashes, and very
red eyes.

This woman appeared perfectly calm.

Having caught her cloak against something, she detached it carefully,
without any haste, and sat down.

The third prisoner was Maslova.

As soon as she appeared, the eyes of all the men in the court
turned her way, and remained fixed on her white face, her
sparklingly-brilliant black eyes and the swelling bosom under the
prison cloak. Even the gendarme whom she passed on her way to her
seat looked at her fixedly till she sat down, and then, as if
feeling guilty, hurriedly turned away, shook himself, and began
staring at the window in front of him.

The president paused until the prisoners had taken their seats, and
when Maslova was seated, turned to the secretary.

Then the usual procedure commenced; the counting of the jury, remarks
about those who had not come, the fixing of the fines to be exacted
from them, the decisions concerning those who claimed exemption,
the appointing of reserve jurymen.

Having folded up some bits of paper and put them in one of the
glass vases, the president turned up the gold-embroidered cuffs of
his uniform a little way, and began drawing the lots, one by one,
and opening them.

Nekhludoff was among the jurymen thus drawn.

Then, having let down his sleeves, the president requested the priest
to swear in the jury.

The old priest, with his puffy, red face, his brown gown, and his gold
cross and little order, laboriously moving his stiff legs, came up
to the lectern beneath the icon.

The jurymen got up, and crowded towards the lectern.

"Come up, please," said the priest, pulling at the cross on his breast
with his plump hand, and waiting till all the jury had drawn near.
When they had all come up the steps of the platform, the priest
passed his bald, grey head sideways through the greasy opening of
the stole, and, having rearranged his thin hair, he again turned
to the jury. "Now, raise your right arms in this way, and put your
fingers together, thus," he said, with his tremulous old voice,
lifting his fat, dimpled hand, and putting the thumb and two first
fingers together, as if taking a pinch of something.

"Now, repeat after me, 'I promise and swear, by the Almighty God,
by His holy gospels, and by the life-giving cross of our Lord,
that in this work which,'" he said, pausing between each sentence--"don't
let your arm down; hold it like this," he remarked to a young man
who had lowered his arm--"'that in this work which . . . '"
The dignified man with the whiskers, the colonel, the merchant, and
several more held their arms and fingers as the priest required of
them, very high, very exactly, as if they liked doing it; others
did it unwillingly and carelessly.

Some repeated the words too loudly, and with a defiant tone, as if
they meant to say, "In spite of all, I will and shall speak."
Others whispered very low, and not fast enough, and then, as if
frightened, hurried to catch up the priest. Some kept their fingers
tightly together, as if fearing to drop the pinch of invisible
something they held; others kept separating and folding theirs. Every
one save the old priest felt awkward, but he was sure he was
fulfilling a very useful and important duty.

After the swearing in, the president requested the jury to choose a
foreman, and the jury, thronging to the door, passed out into the
debating-room, where almost all of them at once began to smoke
cigarettes. Some one proposed the dignified man as foreman, and
he was unanimously accepted. Then the jurymen put out their
cigarettes and threw them away and returned to the court. The
dignified man informed the president that he was chosen foreman,
and all sat down again on the high-backed chairs.
Everything went smoothly, quickly, and not without a certain
solemnity. And this exactitude, order, and solemnity evidently
pleased those who took part in it: it strengthened the impression
that they were fulfilling a serious and valuable public duty.
Nekhludoff, too, felt this.
As soon as the jurymen were seated, the president made a speech on
their rights, obligations, and responsibilities. While speaking he
kept changing his position; now leaning on his right, now on his
left hand, now against the back, then on the arms of his chair, now
putting the papers straight, now handling his pencil and paper-knife.
It was a matter only to be attempted by gentle hints, for though
reared in a strictly religious household, Peregrine's ears seemed to
have been absolutely closed, partly by nursery ideas of his own
exclusion from the pale of humanity, partly by the harsh treatment
that he was continually bringing on himself.  Preachings and prayers
to him only meant a time of intolerable restraint, usually ending in
disgrace and punishment; Scripture and the Westminster Catechism
contained a collection of tasks more tedious and irksome than the
Latin and Greek Grammar; Sunday was his worst day of the week, and
these repugnances, as he had been taught to believe, were so many
proofs that he was a being beyond the power of grace.

Mrs. Woodford scrupled to leave him to any one else on this first
Sunday of his recovered consciousness, and in hopes of keeping him
quiet through fatigue, she contrived that it should be the first day
of his being dressed, and seated in the arm-chair, resting against
cushions beside the open window, whence he could watch the church-
goers, Anne in her little white cap, with her book in one hand, and
a posy in the other, tripping demurely beside her uncle, stately in
gown, cassock, and scarlet hood.

sailor with a wooden leg, was bold enough to answer, "Ay, ay, sir,
you parsons and gentlefolk don't believe naught; but you've not seen
what I have with my own two bodily eyes--" and this of course was
the prelude to the history of an encounter with a mermaid, which
alternated with the Flying Dutchman and a combat with the Moors, as
regular entertainment at the Sunday meal.

Nekhludoff followed the direction.

Meanwhile some of the Criminal Court jurymen who were late had hurriedly
passed into a separate room. At the door mentioned two men
stood waiting.

One, a tall, fat merchant, a kind-hearted fellow, had evidently
partaken of some refreshments and a glass of something, and
was in most pleasant spirits. The other was a shopman of Jewish
extraction. They were talking about the price of wool when
Nekhludoff came up and asked them if this was the jurymen's
room.

"Yes, my dear sir, this is it. One of us? On the jury, are you?"
asked the merchant, with a merry wink.

"Ah, well, we shall have a go at the work together," he continued,
after Nekhludoff had answered in the affirmative. "My name is Baklasheff,
merchant of the Second Guild," he said, putting out his broad,
soft, flexible hand.

"With whom have I the honour?"
Nekhludoff gave his name and passed into the jurymen's room.

Inside the room were about ten persons of all sorts. They had
come but a short while ago, and some were sitting, others walking
up and down, looking at each other, and making each other's
acquaintance.

There was a retired colonel in uniform; some were in frock
coats, others in morning coats, and only one wore a peasant's
dress.

Their faces all had a certain look of satisfaction at the prospect
of fulfilling a public duty, although many of them had had to
leave their businesses, and most were complaining of it.

The jurymen talked among themselves about the weather, the early
spring, and the business before them, some having been introduced,
others just guessing who was who. Those who were not acquainted
with Nekhludoff made haste to get introduced, evidently looking upon
this as an honour, and he taking it as his due, as he always did when
among strangers. Had he been asked why he considered himself above
the majority of people, he could not have given an answer; the
life he had been living of late was not particularly meritorious.
The fact of his speaking English, French, and German with a good
accent, and of his wearing the best linen, clothes, ties, and studs,
bought from the most expensive dealers in these goods, he quite
knew would not serve as a reason for claiming superiority.

At the same time he did claim superiority, and accepted the respect
paid him as his due, and was hurt if he did not get it. In the
jurymen's room his feelings were hurt by disrespectful treatment.

Among the jury there happened to be a man whom he knew, a former
teacher of his sister's children, Peter Gerasimovitch. Nekhludoff
never knew his surname, and even bragged a bit about this.

This man was now a master at a public school. Nekhludoff could not
stand his familiarity, his self-satisfied laughter, his vulgarity,
in short.Such sayings do not become a young maid.  This
poor lad has scarce known kindness.  Every one's hand has been
against him, and so his hand has been against every one.  costs" would
