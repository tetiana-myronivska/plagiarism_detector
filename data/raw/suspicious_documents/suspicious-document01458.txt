THE BOY WITH THE U. S. FISHERIES

CHAPTER I

MAROONED BY A WHALE


"There she blows!"

Colin Dare, who was sitting beside the broken whale-gun and who had been
promised that he might go in the boat that would be put out from the
ship if a whale were sighted, jumped to his feet at the cry from the
'barrel' at the masthead.

"Where?" he shouted eagerly, rushing to the rail and staring as hard as
he could at the heaving gray waters of the Behring Sea.

"There she blo-o-ows!" again cried the lookout, in the long echoing call
of the old-time whaler, and stretching out his hand, he pointed to a
spot in the ocean about three points off the starboard bow. Colin's
glance followed the direction, and almost immediately he saw the faint
cloud of vapor which showed that a whale had just spouted.

"Do you suppose that's a whalebone whale, Hank?" asked the boy, turning
to a lithe Yankee sea-dog with a scraggy gray beard who had been busily
working over the mechanism of the whale-gun.

"No sayin'," was the cautious reply, "we're too fur off to be able to
tell yet a while. How fur away do you reckon we be?"

"A mile or two, I suppose," Colin said, "but we ought to catch up with
the whale pretty soon, oughtn't we?"

"That depends," the gunner answered, "on whether the whale's willin' or
not. He ain't goin' to stay, right there."

"But you usually do catch up?"

"If it's a 'right' whale we generally try to, an' havin' steam to help
us out makes a pile o' difference. Now, in the ol' days, I've seen a
dozen whales to wind'ard an' we couldn't get to 'em at all. By the time
we'd beaten 'round to where they'd been sighted, they were gone."

"Well, I hope this is a 'right' whale," Colin said with emphatic
earnestness.

"Why this one 'specially?" the old sailor asked.

"I heard Captain Murchison say that if we came up with a whale while the
gun was out of order, rather than lose a chance, he would send a boat
out in the old-fashioned way."

"An' you want to see how it's done, eh?"

"I got permission to go in the boat!" the boy answered triumphantly,
"and I just can't wait."

"It's the skipper's business, I suppose, but I don't hold with takin'
any chances you don't have to," was the gruff comment, "an' if you'll
take the advice of an old hand at the game you'll keep away."

"But I want to go so much, Hank," came the reply.

"What for?"

"I'm trying to get Father's permission to join the Bureau of Fisheries,"
explained the boy, "and when Captain Murchison started on this trip, I
begged him to let me come. The captain is an old friend of his."

"I'd rather you went in somebody else's boat than mine, then," was the
ungracious response.

"Why, Hank!" exclaimed Colin in surprise, "what a thing to say!"

The old sailor nodded sagely.

"The skipper don't know much more about boat-whalin' than you do," he
said, "that was all done away before his time. He's willin' to tackle
anythin' that comes along, all right, but a whalin' boat is just about
the riskiest thing that floats on water."

"How's that, Hank?" asked the boy. "I always thought they were supposed
to be so seaworthy."

"They may be seaworthy," was the grim reply, "but I never yet saw a
shipwright who'd guarantee to make a boat that'd be whaleworthy."

"But I'm sure I've read somewhere that whales never attacked boats,"
persisted Colin.

"Mebbe," rejoined the gunner, "but I don't believe that any man what
writes about whalin' bein' easy, has ever tried it in a small boat."

"Well," said the boy, "isn't it true that the only time a whale-boat is
smashed up is when the monster threshes around in the death-flurry and
happens to hit the boat with his tail?"

"Not always."

"You mean a whale does sometimes go for a boat, in spite of what the
books say?"

"I never heard that whales cared much about literatoor," the sailor
answered with an attempt at rough humor, "an' anyway, most o' them books
you've been readin', lad, are written about whalin' off Greenland an' in
the Atlantic."

"What difference does that make?" queried Colin. "Isn't a whale the same
sort of animal all the world over?"

THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY.
VOL. XLV. FEBRUARY, 1891. No. 2.
American Missionary Association.

_OUR LIST OF FIELD WORKERS._

We present herewith our usual February list of missionaries, in church
and school, through the field of the Association. In this list many
thousands of our readers will recognize familiar names, some through
personal associations and others through their long-time acquaintance
with the work of the Association.

It is no unimportant feature of the great principle of co-operation
on which our work is founded that we can reckon upon a large force
of long-tried and experienced workers in the field.

The Association has a wealth of wisdom in planning and carrying on its
work, by its ability to call into requisition the knowledge and
efforts of those who have spent many years in the South, and are intimately
acquainted with the needs, difficulties and advantages of the work.
Many individualistic schemes have failed at this point; but the
Association has developed a force that can be relied upon for the
intelligent investigation of new openings, the prudent planning of
work and its wise and steady support and development.

At the same time, associated with our older workers, we have the younger
missionaries and teachers with their fresh enthusiasm and fervent zeal,
giving new impulse of activity all along the line. This long list of
names represents years of self-denying attention and steady effort;
it speaks of large progress in the past and is the presage of still
greater progress in the future, for the list grows year by year. Our
resources and forces were never before so large as during the past
year, and we are encouraged to hope that they will be increased
during the year to come

.

* * * * *

_FINANCIAL._
Our current receipts for December were nearly $52,000, an increase of
$11,000 over those of December, 1889. For the first quarter of our present
fiscal year the current receipts amount to $106,000, as against
$100,000 for the corresponding period of last year. We thankfully
appreciate every enlargement of our resources, and shall continue to
use our best endeavors to keep the work within the means provided for
it.

How difficult this is can be understood only by those who are in
constant receipt of numerous exigent calls for work in the great populations
among which our service lies.

As a matter of record, notwithstanding the utmost care on our part, while
our receipts for this quarter have gained $6,000 over those of last
year, our expenses have increased $12,000. We are profoundly grateful
for the increasing public interest and Christian co-operation in
the work of the American Missionary Association, and hope that the
gifts of the churches will continue to be accompanied by their
counsels and their prayers

.

* * * * *

_THEOLOGICAL INSTRUCTION._
The association is undertaking to supply the serious need, met
all along its lines of missionary service, of a more intelligent and
consecrated ministry.

For the use of our Biblical Training School for the ministry, at
Fisk University, we are engaged in the erection of the building;
and the work has been taken hold of by the Fisk University Singers,
who are meeting with cheering encouragement in the churches.

It is our hope that, within the coming year, an adequate structure
may be provided for this important work.

The theological department at Howard University has received a
valuable accession to its faculty in the person of Prof.

Ewell.

This work will now be re-classified and developed, and will offer
unexcelled advantages for practical training in preparation for the
gospel ministry

.

* * * * *

_CONFERENCE WITH INDIAN COMMISSIONERS._
The Annual Conference of the Board of Indian Commissioners with the
representatives of the various religious bodies having charge of
Indian Missions was held in the parlors of the Riggs House, January
8th.

The presence of Senator Dawes, Representative Cutcheon, and other
distinguished persons, gave weight to the deliberations, and special
interest was added to the meeting by the troubles now prevailing in
the Dakotas among the Sioux Indians. Commissioner Morgan, Captain Pratt
of the Carlisle School, General Armstrong of Hampton, and the
Secretaries of the Missionary Societies presented an array of facts
and of recent information that gave a more favorable aspect to the
situation than is generally entertained.

The disturbance among the Indians is confined to at most 5,000 among the
250,000, and strong hopes are entertained that serious bloodshed
may be avoided.

And yet, so great is the uncertainty hanging over this matter, that
before these lines reach our readers, the daily press may give sad news
of battle and disaster.

The discussions of the Conference were ended with a series of
resolutions, the purport of which may thus be summed up: The Dakota
trouble is confined to a small number of Indians, and is due to the
inevitable opposition of the chiefs and anti-progressive elements
among the masses of the Indians.

The removal of experienced Indian Agents for political reasons was
deprecated, and the importance of permanence in the lines of policy
pursued in the educational and Christianizing influences was
emphasized.

Larger appropriations by the Government to establish an adequate
system of common-school education, until every Indian child is
enabled to attend school, compulsory education and the continued
support to contract schools, and additional facilities for securing
lands in severalty to the Indians, were endorsed.

The decision which it was understood the Government had made, not to
transfer the care of the Indians to the War Department, was warmly
approbated.

* * * * *

_THE INDIAN PROBLEM._
The present difficulties among the Indians in the Dakotas will probably
lead to a re-consideration of the whole system by which the Government
and the nation deals with these people. As a contribution to that
discussion, we present in condensed form some suggestions recently published
in a Boston paper, from our esteemed friend, S.B. Capen, Esq., whose
intelligent interest in the Indian entitles his opinion to thoughtful
consideration:

While public attention is everywhere called to this matter, it is time
to agitate for a radical change in the whole administration of the
Indian service.

We believe that this should be disconnected entirely from the
Department of the Interior, and be made a _separate department_.

This whole Indian question is so important and so complex that it ought
not to be simply an annex to a department which has under its control
land, patents, etc. It should stand by itself; there should no longer be
a divided responsibility, which is always productive of evil. We
are finding the necessity in our cities of making responsibility
more direct and personal.

The time, we believe, has fully come to reorganize the Indian service
on this basis. Our criticism is not against any individual, but against
a system which is the growth of many years.

We would suggest the following;

1. Have the Commissioner of Indian Affairs responsible only to the President
and to the public. What he does, or may do, shall not be controlled by
the Department of the Interior.

2.

Ask Congress to provide such legislation that no agents or teachers shall
ever be removed without proper cause.

3. All inspectors and special agents shall be under the absolute control
of the Commissioner.

4. There shall be a division of the Indian reservation into school
districts, with an assistant superintendent for each. It shall be
their duty to visit the schools constantly, and keep themselves
in full sympathy and touch with the work.

This is the method in the States--an official responsible for a field
which he can properly cover

.

* * * * *

_EDUCATORS' CONVENTION._
The recent Educators' Convention of Atlanta was a large and significant
gathering.

Such consultations of teachers carry a wide and beneficial influence.
We learn that the papers and addresses were of a high character,
and that the discussions were carried on with great interest, and
we have no doubt that the educational work throughout the South
will feel the upward impulse of this Convention.

We quote the following paragraph from the excellent report in the
_Congregationalist_:

The importance of the work of the Convention may be indicated by the
topics discussed: Education in Rural Districts, Relative Mortality of
the Colored Race, Hygiene, Industrial Training, Better Teaching in
the Elementary Grades, A Scientific Course in the College Curriculum,
Compulsory Education, What Can the Negro Do?
What the Ministry is Doing to Elevate the Freedmen.

A résumé was given of the educational work of the different denominations,
mainly by the secretaries of their educational societies. The reports
of the colored Methodist churches were especially interesting, as
indicating the gratifying extent to which the colored people are taking
hold of the work of their own education.
No paper of the Convention, however, was received with such spontaneous
enthusiasm and applause as the report of Dr.

Beard of the work of the American Missionary Association. It was the
eloquence of facts.

The proceedings of the Association will constitute a large volume,
which will soon be published and widely circulated

.

* * * * *

_"AN OPEN PATH FOR TALENT."_

Napoleon said this was the meaning of the French Revolution.

He gave promotion in the army not for what a man's ancestry had
been, but for what the man himself could do.

Who else ever had such efficient subordinates?

Opportunities became open generally in France, according to each
one's personal ability.

The excesses of the revolutionary period were transitory. The enlargement
of the nation's power, by removing the fetters of prescription, has been
permanent. The recuperative energy displayed by France in the last twenty
years is a marvelous example of the strength imparted by liberty.

The educational work of the American Missionary Association in the South
makes no revolutionary disturbance. It quietly opens a path for
talent whose existence had been before unnoticed or denied. It
has been already instrumental in bringing forward many men and
women to positions of influence.

Beginning with the lowest branches of education, it trained the
first colored teachers for the State school systems.

Its schools for higher education have as yet come far short of supplying
the demand for advanced teachers and for educated ministers and
other educated professional and business men.

We cannot make talent, but opening the door for talent to find
development and activity adds rich gifts to the Nation's life

.

* * * * *

_IRRESPONSIBLE INSTITUTIONS._
_The Independent_, in its Symposium of December 11th upon Gen.

Booth's Plan, has an article from Charles D. Kellogg, Superintendent
of the Charity Organization Society, in which, referring to a certain
irresponsible piece of charity, he says:

We do not believe that it is right for any one to ask for the support
of such an individual enterprise, except from those who give it because
of personal knowledge and confidence in the manager.

When the public is appealed to, such contributions take on the nature of
trust funds, the receipts and disbursements of which should be audited
and accounted for in the fullest and frankest manner.

To encourage such private, uncontrolled and unaccounted for undertakings,
is simply to open the door for any number of conscienceless schemers who
are quick to impose upon the benevolent public.

The same is true of irresponsible educational institutions. All who
receive funds for such charitable purposes, are virtually stewards of
_trust money_ and ought to give an account of the same. All properties
thus developed ought to be put into a shape to be held securely
and perpetuated, and not left to become the personal possession of
the solicitors.

Pious zeal and "faith" do not prevent the waste in such a case. "Wisdom
would not put cut and hammer-faced stone for the foundation of a mountain
school house, and costly glass in the windows," but "faith" has done
this, and keeps on doing similar things.

_NOTES FROM NEW ENGLAND._
By District Secretary C.J. Ryder, Boston, Mass.

TWO WAYS OF DOING IT.

"So you have come! Well! I don't know but it is just as favorable a
time as any. Still, we are in a very pinched condition. We have a debt
that we have carried for ten years and have scarcely been able to pay
the interest. The parsonage is in a desperate condition, and we are
very far from comfortable in it.

Secretary Hood was here two months ago, and he stirred the people
up and took all that ought to be given to any of our Benevolent
Societies.

Then, a month ago, Puddefoot was here, and you know he sweeps in
everything that can possibly be reached. I sometimes think that he awakens
too much interest, and that the churches give too large collections. Our
women are all interested in the American Board, and will not feel like
doing much for the American Missionary Association Still, it is the
time for our annual collection, and I think no harm can come from an
address on the A.M.A. work to-morrow. We are very glad to see you."

_This is one way._

"How do you do, dear old friend? I declare, it seems as if I had known
you a life-time. I am ever so glad you could come and speak to my church
to-morrow. We need stirring up tremendously.

Although my people are a large-hearted, generous people, they are
so much absorbed with our own interests here, that I fear sometimes
they do not appreciate the larger work done through the Benevolent
Societies.

Secretary Creegan was here a little while ago and took away a splendid
collection, but he left a lot of ripe grain to be gathered in the
harvest of some other society.

"Guess that's the end of him," said Scotty, as the big animal beat the
air with his tail, the slap of the huge flukes throwing up a fountain of
spray.

"That's the end," agreed Hank.

Almost with the word the great gray whale turned, one fin looming above
the water as he did so, and sank heavily to the bottom, the buoy which
had been attached to the harpoon-line by Scotty showing where he sank,
so that the ship could pick up the carcass later.

"How big do you suppose that whale was?" queried the boy as they started
to pull back to the ship.

"'Bout forty-five foot, I reckon," was the reply, "an' we ought to get
about twenty barrels of oil out of him."

"That ought to help some," said Colin, "and you see my coming didn't
hurt anything. Just think if I had missed all that fun!"

"It turned out all right," the old whaler said, "but I tell you it was a
narrow squeak. They'll have been worryin' on board, though, if any one
has been able to see that we were hitched up to a gray whale."

"Isn't there any danger with other whales?"

"Wa'al, you've got to know how to get at 'em, of course. But all you've
got to do is to keep out o' the way. There's no whale except the
California whale that'll charge a boat. I did know one chap that was
killed by a humpback, but that was because the whale come up suddenly
right under the boat and upset it--they often do that--an' when one of
the chaps was in the water the whale happened to give a slap with his
tail an' the poor fellow was right under it."

Colin was anxious to start the old whaler on some yarns of the early
days, but as the boat was nearing the ship he decided to wait for an
opportunity when there would be more time and the raconteur would have
full leeway for his stories.

"Forty-five-footer, sir," called Hank, as they came up to the ship.
"Gray devil, sir."

The captain lifted his eyebrows in surprise, for he had not thought of a
California whale so far north, but he answered in an offhand way:

"More sport than profit in that. Did you have a run for your money,
Colin?"

"I certainly did, Captain Murchison," the boy answered.

"All right, tell me about it some time. Hank, you're on board just in
the nick of time. I found out what the trouble was with the carriage of
the gun and repaired it while you were amusing yourselves out there. Get
in lively, now, there's work to do."

The men scrambled on board rapidly, and the boat was up in the davits in
less than a minute, while the yards were braced round, and under sail
and steam the _Gull_ headed north.

"There's four whales in sight, Hank," said the captain; "humpbacks, I
think, and two of them big ones."

"If they'll bunch up like that, sir," the gunner said, "we may make a
good trip out of it yet."

"I hope so," the skipper answered, and turning on his heel, he went to
the poop. Thither Colin followed him and told him all the story of the
whale. The captain, who was an old friend of Colin's father when they
both lived in a lumbering town in northern Michigan, was greatly taken
aback when he found how dangerous the boat-trip had been, but he did not
want to spoil the boy's vivid memories of the excitement.

"I suppose," he said, "that you want to go out as gunner next time."

Colin shook his head.

"I'm generally willing to try anything, Captain Murchison," he replied,
"but I'm content to let Hank look after that end."

"Hank's an unusual man," the captain said quietly. "I rather doubt if
any other man on the Pacific Coast could have won out with a gray whale.
I'd rather have him aboard than a lot of mates I know, and as a gunner,
of course, he's a sort of petty officer."

The canvas began to shake as the boat turned on its course after the
whales, catching the skipper's eye, and he roared out orders to shorten
sail.

"Clew up fore and main to'gans'ls," he shouted; "take in the tops'ls.
Colin, you go and furl the fore to'gans'l, and if the men are still busy
on the tops'l yards, pass the gaskets round the main to'gans'l as well."

"Aye, aye, sir," the boy answered readily, for he enjoyed being aloft,
and he clambered up the shrouds to the fore-topgallant yard and furled
the sail, taking a pride in having it lie smooth and round on the top of
the yard.

"What's the difference between a 'finback' and a 'humpback,' Hank?"
asked the boy, after the canvas had been stowed, the vessel under
auxiliary steam having speed enough to keep up with the cetaceans, "are
they 'right' whales?"

"Neither of 'em," the gunner replied: "there's two kinds of right whale,
the bowhead and the black, and both have fine whalebone, an' that, as
you know, is a sort of strainer in the mouth that takes the place of
teeth. Humpbacks an' finbacks are taken for oil, an' they look quite
different. A humpback is more in bulk an' has only a short fin on the
back, it's a clumsy beast an' throws the flukes of the tail out of the
water in soundin'. Now, a finback is built more for speed an' has a big
fin on the back--that's where it gets its name. The big sulphurbottom is
a kind of finback, an' is the largest animal livin'. I've seen one
eighty-five feet long!"

"Where does the sperm whale come in?" asked Colin.

"It's got teeth, like the gray whale," was the reply, "but you never
find it in cold water. Sperm whalin' is comin' into favor again. But
those two over there--the ones we're after, are finbacks. You can tell
by the spout, by the fin, by not seein' the flukes of the tail, an' by
the way they play around, slappin' each other in fun."

Three hours were spent in the fruitless chase after this little group of
whales. Then Hank, who had been standing in the bow beside the gun,
watching every move of the cetacean during the afternoon, suddenly
signaled with his hand for "full speed astern," by this maneuver
stopping the ship squarely, as a whale--a medium-sized finback--came up
right under the vessel's bow. The reversed screws took the craft astern
so as to show the broad back about twenty-five feet away, and Hank
fired.

The crashing roar of the harpoon-gun was followed by a swirl as the
whale sounded for a long dive, but a moment later there came a dull,
muffled report from the water, the explosive head of the harpoon, known
as the 'bomb,' having burst. For a minute or two there was no sound but
the swish of the line and the clank of the big winch as it ran out,
while the animal sank to the bottom. There was a moment's wait, and
then Hank, seeing the line tauten and hang down straight, called back:

"We can haul in, sir; I got him just right."

Compared to the excitement of the chase in the open boat this seemed
very tame to Colin, and he said so to the captain, when he went aft,
while the steam-winch gradually drew up the finback whose end had come
so suddenly.

"My boy," was the reply, "I'm not whaling for my health. Other people
have a share in this, besides myself and the crew, and what they're
after is whales--not sport. The business isn't what it was; in the old
days whale-oil was worth a great deal and whaling was a good business.
Then came the discovery of petroleum and the Standard Oil Company soon
found out ways of refining the crude product so that it took the place
of whale-oil in every way and at a cheaper price."

"But I thought whalebone was what you were after!" said Colin in
surprise.

"It was for a time," the captain answered, "after the oil business gave
out. But within the last ten years there have been so many substitutes
for whalebone that its value has gone down. There's a lot of whalebone
stored in New Bedford warehouses that can't be sold except at a loss."

"Well, if the oil is replaced and whalebone has no value, what is to be
got out of whaling now, then?" the boy queried.

"Oil again," was the reply; "for fine lubricating work there's nothing
as good. It's queer, though, how things have changed around. Fifty years
ago, New Bedford was the greatest whaling port in the world, ten years
ago there wasn't a ship there, they had all gone to San Francisco. Now
'Frisco is deserted by whalers, and the few in the business have gone
back to the old port."

In the meantime, while Colin had been telling the story of the adventure
with the gray whale, and the captain had been bemoaning the decay of the
whaling industry, the work of bringing the dead whale to the surface had
been under way. Letting out more slack on the rope attached to the
harpoon a bight of it was passed through a sheave-block at the masthead,
thus giving a greater purchase for the lifting of the heavy body. The
winch was run by a small donkey-engine, and for about ten minutes the
line was hauled in, fathom after fathom being coiled on the deck.
Presently, as Colin looked over the rail, the dark body of the whale
was seen coming to the surface, and as he was hauled alongside a chain
was thrown around his flukes, and the body was made fast to the vessel,
tail foremost.

Just as soon as the whale was secured a sailor jumped on the body,
carrying with him a long steel tube, pierced with a number of holes for
several inches from the bottom. To this he attached a long rubber tube,
while the other end was connected with a small air-pump. The ever-handy
donkey-engine was used to work the pump, and the body of the whale was
slowly filled with air in the same way that a bicycle tire is inflated.

"What's that for?" asked Colin, who had been watching the process with
much curiosity.

"So that he will float," the captain answered. "You can't tow a whale
that's lying on the bottom!"

"But I thought you were going to cut him up!"

"And boil down the blubber on board?"

"Yes."

"That's very seldom done now," the captain explained. "In the old days,
when whaling-ships went on three and four year voyages they 'fleshed'
the blubber at sea and boiled it down or 'tried it out,' as they called
it, into oil. They always carried a cooper along, too, and made their
own barrels, so that after a long voyage a ship would come back with her
hold full of barrels of whale-oil."

"What's the method now, Captain Murchison?" asked Colin.

"Nearly all whaling is done by steamers and not very far from the coast,
say within a day's steaming. We catch the whales, blow them out in the
way you see the men doing now, and tow them to the nearest 'trying out'
factory. These places have conveniences that would be impossible on
shipboard, they get a better quality of oil, and they use up all the
animal, getting oil out of the meat as well as the blubber. Then the
flesh is dried and sold for fertilizer just as the bones are. The fins
and tail are shipped to Japan for table delicacies. Even the water in
which the blubber has been tried out makes good glue. So, you see, it
pays to tow a whale to the factory. And besides, the smell of trying out
on one of the old whalers was horrible beyond description."

During this explanation the huge carcass of the whale had been distended
to almost twice its natural size, and now it floated high out of the
water. The steel tube was pulled out and a buoy with a flag was
attached to the whale, which was then set adrift to be picked up and
towed to the factory later.

Almost immediately the "tink-tink" of the bell of the signaler to the
engine-room told that the ship was headed after another whale. The sea
was rising and the wind was beginning to whistle through the rigging.
Colin felt well satisfied that the canvas was stowed and that he would
not have to go aloft during the night. The evening light, however, was
still good enough for a shot, and Hank, at the bow, was swinging the
heavy gun from side to side on its stand to assure himself that it was
in good condition.

Owing to the approaching darkness, there was no time to wait for an
exact shot, and Hank fired at the big finback on the first opportunity.
The ship was rolling and pitching, however, and the harpoon, instead of
striking the big whale, went clear over her and into the water beyond,
crashing into the side of a little calf whale not more than sixteen feet
long, the weapon going almost through him.

Apparently unconscious of what had happened to her baby, the mother
whale sounded and sounded deep, not coming up for nearly twenty
minutes. When she rose, she was at least a quarter of a mile away, and
Colin, who was standing by Hank in the bow, wondered why the ship did
not go in pursuit.

"Why don't we chase her up?" he asked.

"She'll come lookin' for her calf," the old whaler answered, "an' as
long as we stay near that she'll come up to us. Lots of whalers shoot
the calves a-purpose, makin' it easier to get the old whales, but I
don't hold with that. I've never done it. Shootin' this one was just an
accident, but as long as the little chap is dead anyhow, we might as
well make use of him."

Just as the old whaler had predicted, in less than five minutes the
mother whale spouted, coming in the direction of the vessel. In less
than five minutes more she spouted again, just a little distance from
the calf. Not understanding what had happened, she swam around as though
to persuade the little one to follow her, and as she circled round the
calf she came within range of the harpoon-gun. It was far too dark to
see clearly, but Hank chanced a shot. The sudden roar startled Colin.

"Did you get her?" he asked anxiously.

"I hit her, all right," the gunner answered with a dissatisfied air,
"but not just where I wanted."

The boy thought it wonderful that he should have been able to hit the
monster at all, so small a portion of the body was exposed and so
heavily was the _Gull_ pitching. The whale, instead of sounding
directly, dived at a sharp angle and the line ran out like lightning.

"What's that, Hank?" It was reserved for Nelson's genius to bring a
sufficiently powerful solvent to bear on the crystallised opinion of
the service, and to find a formula which would shed all that was
bad and combine all that was good in previous systems.[7]
The dominating ideas that were in his mind become clearer, if we
follow step by step all the evidence that has survived as to the
genesis and history of his memorandum.

As early as 1798, when he was hoping to intercept Bonaparte's expedition
to Egypt, he had adopted a system which was not based on the single
line, and so far as is known this was the first tactical order he
ever framed as a fleet commander.

It is contained in a general order issued from the Vanguard on June
8 of that year, and runs as follows, as though hot from the lesson
of St.

Vincent: 'As it is very probable the enemy will not be formed in regular
order on the approach of the squadron under my command, I may in
that case deem it most expedient to attack them by separate divisions.

In which case the commanders of divisions are strictly enjoined to keep
their ships in the closest possible order, and on no account whatever
to risk the separation of one of their ships.'[8] The divisional
organisation follows, being his own division of six sail and two
others of four each. 'Had he fallen in with the French fleet at sea,'
wrote Captain Berry, who was sent home with despatches after the Nile,
'that he might make the best impression upon any part of it that
should appear the most vulnerable or the most eligible for attack, he
divided his force into three sub-squadrons [one of six sail and
two of four each].

Two of these sub-squadrons were to attack the ships of war, while the third
was to pursue the transports and to sink and destroy as many as it
could.'[9] The exact manner in which he intended to use this
organisation he had explained constantly by word of mouth to his
captains, but no further record of his design has been found.

Still there is an alteration which he made in his signal book at
the same time that gives us the needed light.

We cannot fail to notice the striking resemblance between his method
of attack by separate divisions on a disordered enemy, and that
made by the Elizabethan admirals at Gravelines upon the Armada after
its formation had been broken up by the fireships.

That attack was made intuitively by divisions independently handled as
occasion should dictate, and Nelson's new signal leaves little doubt
that this was the plan which he too intended. The alteration he
ordered was to change the signification of Signal 16, so that it meant
that each of his flag officers, from the moment it was made,
should have control of his own division and make any signals he
thought proper.

But this was not all. By the same general order he made two other alterations
in the signal book in view of encountering the French in order of battle.
They too are of the highest interest and run as follows: 'To be inserted
in pencil in the signal book.

At No. 182. Being to windward of the enemy, to denote I mean to attack the
enemy's line from the rear towards the van as far as thirteen
ships, or whatsoever number of the British ships of the line may
be present, that each ship may know his opponent in the enemy's
line.'

No. 183. 'I mean to press hard with the whole force on the enemy's
rear

.'[10]
Thus we see that at the very first opportunity Nelson had of enforcing
his own tactical ideas he enunciated three of the principles upon which
his great memorandum was based, viz. breaking up his line of battle
into three divisional lines, independent control by divisional
leaders, and concentration on the enemy's rear.

All that is wanting are the elements of surprise and containing.

These, however, we see germinating in the memorandum he issued five
years later off Toulon. In that case he expected to meet the French fleet
on an opposite course, and being mainly concerned in stopping it and
having a slightly superior force he is content to concentrate on the
van. But, in view of the strategical necessity of making the attack
in this way, he takes extra precautions which are not found in the
general order of 1798.

He provides for preventing the enemy's knowing on which side his attack
is to fall; instead of engaging an equal number of their ships he provides
for breaking their line, and engaging the bulk of their fleet with
a superior number of his own; and finally he looks to being ready
to contain the enemy's rear before it can do him any damage.

Thus, taking together the general order of 1798 and the Toulon
memorandum of 1803, we can see all the tactical ideas that were
involved at Trafalgar already in his mind, and we are in a position
to appreciate the process of thought by which he gradually evolved
the sublimely simple attack that welded them together, and brought
them all into play without complication or risk of mistake.

This process, which crowns Nelson's reputation as the greatest naval
tactician of all time, we must now follow in detail.

Shortly before he left England for the last time, he communicated
to Keats, of the Superb, a full explanation of his views as they
then existed in his mind, and Keats has preserved it in the following
paper which Nicolas printed.

'Memorandum of a conversation between Lord Nelson and Admiral Sir
Richard Keats, the last time he was in England before the battle of
Trafalgar.[11]

'One morning, walking with Lord Nelson in the grounds of Merton,
talking on naval matters, he said to me, "No day can be long enough
to arrange a couple of fleets and fight a decisive battle according
to the old system.

When _we_ meet them" (I was to have been with him), "for meet them
we shall, I'll tell you how I shall fight them.

I shall form the fleet into three divisions in three lines; one division
shall be composed of twelve or fourteen of the fastest two-decked ships,
which I shall keep always to windward or in a situation of advantage,
and I shall put them under an officer who, I am sure, will employ
them in the manner I wish, if possible.

I consider it will always be in my power to throw them into battle in
any part I choose; but if circumstances prevent their being carried
against the enemy where I desire, I shall feel certain he will
employ them effectually and perhaps in a more advantageous manner
than if he could have followed my orders" (he never mentioned or
gave any hint by which I could understand who it was he intended
for this distinguished service).[12] He continued, "With the remaining
part of the fleet, formed in two lines, I shall go at them at once
if I can, about one third of their line from their leading ship."

He then said, "What do you think of it?"

Such a question I felt required consideration.

I paused. Seeing it he said, "But I will tell you what _I_ think
of it.

I think it will surprise and confound the enemy.

They won't know what I am about.

It will bring forward a pell-mell battle, and that is what I want

."[13]
Here we have something roughly on all-fours with the methods of the
First Dutch War. There are the three squadrons, the headlong 'charge'
and the _mêlée_.

The reserve squadron to windward goes even further back, to the
treatise of De Chaves and the Instructions of Lord Lisle in 1545.

It was no wonder it took away Keats's breath.

The return to primitive methods was probably unconscious, but what
was obviously uppermost in Nelson's mind was the breaking up of the
established order in single line, leading by surprise and concealment
to a decisive _mêlée_.

He seems to insist not so much upon defeating the enemy by concentration
as by throwing him into confusion, upsetting his mental equilibrium in
accordance with the primitive idea. The notion of concentration is at
any rate secondary, while the subtle scheme for 'containing' as
perfected in the memorandum is not yet developed.

As he explained his plan to Keats, he meant to attack at once with
both his main divisions, using the reserve squadron as a general support.
There is no clear statement that he meant it as a 'containing'
force, though possibly it was in his mind.[14]
There is one more piece of evidence relating to this time when he
was still in England.

According to this story Lord Hill, about 1840, when still
Commander-in-Chief, was paying a visit to Lord Sidmouth.

His host, who, better known as Addington, had been prime minister till
1804, and was in Pitt's new cabinet till July 1805, showed him a table
bearing a Nelson inscription. He told him that shortly before leaving
England to join the fleet Nelson had drawn upon it after dinner a plan
of his intended attack, and had explained it as follows: 'I shall attack
in two lines, led by myself and Collingwood, and I am confident I
shall capture their van and centre or their centre and rear.'

'Those,' concluded Sidmouth, 'were his very words,' and remarked how
wonderfully they had been fulfilled.[15] Hill and Sidmouth at the
time were both old men and the authority is not high, but so far as it
goes it would tend to show that an attack in two lines instead of
one was still Nelson's dominant idea.

It cannot however safely be taken as evidence that he ever intended a
concentration on the van, though in view of the memorandum of 1803
this is quite possible.

Finally, there is the statement of Clarke and McArthur that Nelson
before leaving England deposited a copy of his plan with Lord
Barham, the new first lord of the admiralty.

This however is very doubtful. The Barham papers have recently been placed
at the disposal of the Society, in the hands of Professor Laughton,
and the only copy of the memorandum he has been able to find is an
incomplete one containing several errors of transcription, and
dated the Victory, October 11, 1805.

In the absence of further evidence therefore no weight can be attached to
the oft-repeated assertion that Nelson had actually drawn up his memorandum
before he left England.

Coming now to the time when he had joined the fleet off Cadiz, the
first light we have is the well-known letter of October 1 to Lady
Hamilton.

In this letter, after telling her that he had joined on September 28, but
had not been able to communicate with the fleet till the 29th, he says,
'When I came to explain to them the _Nelson touch_ it was like an
electric shock.

Some shed tears and all approved.

It was new--it was singular--it was simple.' What he meant exactly
by the 'Nelson touch' has never been clearly explained, but he
could not possibly have meant either concentration or the attack
on the enemy's rear, for neither of these ideas was either new or
singular.

On October 3 he writes to her again: 'The reception I met with on joining
the fleet caused the sweetest sensation of my life.... As soon as these
emotions were past I laid before them the plan I had previously arranged
for attacking the enemy, and it was not only my pleasure to find it
generally approved, but clearly perceived and understood.'[16]
The next point to notice is the 'Order of Battle and Sailing' given by
Nicolas.

It is without date, but almost certainly must have been drawn up
before Nelson joined.

It does not contain the Belleisle, which Nelson knew on October 4 was
to join him.[17] It also does include the name of Sir Robert Calder and
his flagship, and on September 30 Nelson had decided to send both
him and his ship home.[18]
The order is for a fleet of forty sail, but the names of only
thirty-three are given, which were all Nelson really expected to
get in time.

The remarkable feature of this order is that it contains no trace
of the triple organisation of the memorandum.

The 'advanced squadron' is absent, and the order is based on two
equal divisions only.

Then on October 9, after Calder had gone, there is this entry in
Nelson's private diary: 'Sent Admiral Collingwood the Nelson touch.'

It was enclosed in a letter in which Nelson says: 'I send you my
Plan of Attack, as far as a man dare venture to guess at the very
uncertain position the enemy may be found in.

But, my dear friend, it is to place you perfectly at your ease respecting
my intentions and to give full scope to your judgment for carrying
them into effect.'

The same day Collingwood replies, 'I have a just sense of your
lordship's kindness to me, and the full confidence you have reposed
in me inspires me with the most lively gratitude.

I hope it will not be long before there is an opportunity of showing
your lordship that it has not been misplaced.'

On these two letters there can be little doubt that the 'Plan of Attack'
which Nelson enclosed was that of the memorandum. The draft from
which Nicolas printed appears to have been dated October 9, and
originally had in one passage 'you' and 'your' for the 'second in
command,' showing that Nelson in his mind was addressing his remarks
to Collingwood, though subsequently he altered the sentence into
the third person.

Only one other copy was known to Nicolas, and that was issued in the
altered form to Captain Hope, of the Defence, a ship which in the
order of battle was in Collingwood s squadron, but Codrington tells
us it was certainly issued to all the captains.[19]
So far, then, we have the case thus--that whatever Nelson may have
really told Lord Sidmouth, and whatever may have been in his mind
when he drew up the dual order of battle and sailing, he had by
October 9 reverted to the triple idea which he had explained to
Keats.

Meanwhile, however, his conception had ripened.

There are marked changes in organisation, method and intention. In
organisation the reserve squadron is reduced from the original
twelve or fourteen to eight, or one fifth of his hypothetical fleet
instead of about one third--reduced, that is, to a strength at which
it was much less capable of important independent action.

In method we have, instead of an attack with the two main divisions,
an attack with one only, with the other covering it. In intention we have
as the primary function of the reserve squadron, its attachment to
one or other of the other two main divisions as circumstances may
dictate.

The natural inference from these important changes is that Nelson's
conception was now an attack in two divisions of different strength,
the stronger of which, as the memorandum subsequently explains, was
to be used as a containing force to cover the attack of the other,
and except that the balance of the two divisions was reversed, this
is practically just what Clerk of Eldin had recommended and what
actually happened in the battle.

It is a clear advance upon the original idea as explained to Keats, in
which the third squadron was to be used on the primitive and indefinite
plan of De Chaves and Lord Lisle as a general reserve. It also
explains Nelson's covering letter to Collingwood, in which he seems
to convey to his colleague that the pith of his plan was an attack
in two divisions, and, within the general lines of the design,
complete freedom of action for the second in command.

How largely this idea of independent control entered into the 'Nelson
touch' we may judge from the fact that it is emphasised in no less
than three distinct paragraphs of the memorandum.

Such, then, is the fundamental principle of the memorandum as
enunciated in its opening paragraphs.

He then proceeds to elaborate it in two detailed plans of attack--one
from to-leeward and the other from to-windward. It was the latter
he meant to make if possible. He calls it 'the intended attack,' and
it accords with the opening enunciation.
But you'll learn all about it. Beg
pardon, sir," Hank continued, speaking to the captain, "but by the noise
of the seals those must be either the Pribilof or the Commander
Islands?"

"Pribilof, by my reckoning," the captain answered. "Do you hear anything
of the third boat?"

"No, sir," answered the old whaler, after shouting a loud "Ahoy!" to
which but one answer was returned, "but we'll see her, likely, when the
fog lifts."

"Doesn't lift much here," the captain said. "But with this offshore
wind, they ought to hear the seals three or four miles away."

In the meantime the whale-boat was forging through the water slowly and
the noise of the seals grew louder every minute. The sun was rising, but
the fog was so dense that it was barely possible to tell which was the
east.

"Funny kind of fog," said Colin; "seems to me it's about as wet as the
water!"

"Reg'lar seal fog," Hank replied. "If it wasn't always foggy the seals
wouldn't haul out here, an' anyway, there's always a lot of fog around
a rookery. Must be the breath of so many thousands o' seals, I reckon."

[Illustration: SPEARING SEALS AT SEA.

"Pretty things, seals," said the boy.

"Where did you ever see any?" his friend queried.

"Oh, lots of places," Colin answered, "circuses and aquariums and places
like that. I even saw a troupe of them on the stage once, playing ball.
They put up a good game, too."

"Those weren't the real fur seals," Hank replied; "what you saw were the
common hair seals, an' they're not the same at all. You can't keep fur
seals alive in a tank!"

"There are two fur seals in the aquarium of the Fisheries Building at
Washington," interposed the captain, "but those are the only two."

"There!" cried the boy, pointing at the water; "there's one now!"

"You'll see them by hundreds in a few minutes, boy," the captain said.
"I think I make out land."

As he spoke, an eddy of wind blew aside part of the fog, revealing
through the rift a low-lying island. Within a minute the fog had closed
down again, but the glimpse had been enough to give the captain his
bearings. The noise from the seal-rookery had grown deafening, so that
the men had to shout to one another in the boat and presently--and quite
unexpectedly--the boat was in the midst of dozens upon dozens of seals,
throwing themselves out of the water, standing on their hind flippers,
turning somersaults, and performing all manner of antics.

"Why don't we land?" asked Colin, as he noticed that the boat was
running parallel with the shore instead of heading directly for it.

"Land on a seal-rookery?" said Hank. "Haven't you had trouble enough
with whales so far?"

"Would seals attack a boat?" asked Colin in surprise.

"No, you couldn't make 'em," was the instant reply, "but I never heard
of a boat landin' at a rookery. The row would begin when you got
ashore."

Gradually the boat drew closer to the land, as close, indeed, as was
possible along the rocky shore, and then the land receded, forming a
shallow bay flanked by two low hills on one side and one sharper hill on
the other. The captain rolled up his chart and headed straight for the
shore.

"St. Paul, I reckon," said Hank, as the outlines of the land showed
clearly, "but I don't jus' seem to remember it."

"Yes, that's St. Paul," the captain agreed. "It has changed since your
time, Hank. There has been a lot of building since the government took
hold."

"Why, it looks quite civilized!" exclaimed Colin in surprise, as he saw
the well-built, comfortable frame houses and a stone church-spire which
stood out boldly from the hill above the wharf.

"When I first saw St. Paul," said the old whaler, "it looked just about
the way it was when the Russians left it--huts and shacks o' the worst
kind an' the natives were kep' just about half starved."

"It's different nowadays," said the captain as they drew near the wharf,
putting under his arm the tin box that held the ship's papers. "The
Aleuts are regular government employees now and they have schools and
good homes and fair wages. Everything is done to make them comfortable.
I was here last year and could hardly believe it was the same settlement
I saw fifteen years ago."

It was still early morning when the boat was made fast to the wharf, and
Colin was glad to stretch his legs after having slept in a cramped
position all night. The damp fog lay heavily over everything, but the
villagers had been aroused and the group of sailors was soon surrounded
by a crowd, curious to know what had happened. Hank, who could speak a
'pigeon' language of mixed Russian and Aleut, was the center of a group
composed of some of the older men, while Colin graphically described to
all those who knew English (the larger proportion) the fight with the
gray whale, and told of the sinking of the _Gull_ by the big finback,
maddened by the attack of the killers. He had just finished a stirring
recital of the adventures when the other two boats from the _Gull_
loomed up out of the fog and made fast to the wharf.

Hearing that the only breakfast the shipwrecked men had been able to get
was some cold and water-soaked provender from the boat, two or three of
the residents hurried to their homes on hospitable errands bent, and in
a few minutes most of the men were thawing out and allaying the pangs of
hunger with steaming mugs of hot coffee and a solid meal. So, when the
captain came looking for Colin that he might take him to the Fisheries
agent's house, he found the lad--who was thoroughly democratic in his
ways--breakfasting happily with the sailors and recounting for the
second time the thrills and perils of the preceding day.

Rejoining the captain an hour or so later at the house to which he had
been directed, Colin was effusively greeted by the assistant to the
agent, a young fellow full of enthusiasm over the work the Bureau of
Fisheries was doing with regard to fur seals. A natural delicacy had
kept him from troubling Captain Murchison, but as soon as he discovered
that Colin was interested in the question and anxious to find out all he
could about seals, he hailed the opportunity with delight.

"I've just been aching for a chance to blow off steam," he said. "It's
an old story to the people here. Obviously! I don't think they half
realize how worth while it all is. I'm glad to have you here," he
continued, "not only so that we can help you after all your dangers, but
so that I can show you what we do."

"I'm still more glad to be here," Colin replied, after thanking him.
"I've been trying to persuade Father to let me join the Bureau, but this
is such an out-of-the-way place that I never expected to be able to see
it for myself."

"It is a little out of the way," the official replied. "But in some
ways, I think it's the most important place in the entire world so far
as fisheries are concerned. It's the one strategic point for a great
industry. Of course!"

"Why is it so important, Mr. Nagge?" Colin queried. "Just because of the
seals, or are there other fisheries here?"

"Just seals," was the reply, in the jerky speech characteristic of the
man. "Greatest breeding-place in the world. You'll see. Nothing like it
anywhere else. And, what's more, it's almost the last. This is the only
fort left to prevent the destruction not of a tribe--but of an entire
species in the world of life. Certainly!"

"Calling it a fort seems strange," Colin remarked.

"Well, isn't it? It's the heroic post, the forlorn hope, the last stand
of the battle-line," the Fisheries enthusiast replied. "All the nations
of the world were deliberately allowing all the fur seals to be killed
off. Uncle Sam stopped it. It's not too late yet. The Japanese
seal-pirates must be exterminated absolutely! Could you run a ranch if
every time a steer or cow got more than three miles away from the corral
anybody could come along and shoot it? Of course not. Obviously!"

"But this isn't a ranch!"

"Why not? Same principle," the assistant agent answered. "Ranchers breed
cattle in hundreds or thousands. We breed seals in hundreds of
thousands; yes, in millions. And a fur seal is worth more than a steer.
Oh, yes!"

"Do seals breed as largely still?" Colin asked in surprise.

"Would if they had the chance," was the indignant answer. "Undoubtedly
millions and millions have been killed in the last fifty years. Takes
time to build up, too! Only one baby seal is born at a time. A run-down
herd can't increase so very fast. But we're getting there. Certainly!"

"Our gunner was telling me," Colin said, "that killing seals at sea was
the cause of all the trouble."

"Yes. Lately. Before that, rookery after rookery had been visited and
every seal butchered. Old and young alike. No mercy. Worst kind of
cruelty."

"But hasn't the sea trouble been stopped?" queried the boy. "I thought
it had, but you said something just now about seal-pirates."

"Stopped officially," his informant said. "Can't kill a seal in the
ocean, not under any consideration. That is, by law. Not in American
waters. Nor in Russian waters. Nor in Japanese waters. Nor in the open
sea. International agreement determines that. Of course. But lots of
people break laws. Obviously! Big profit in it. There's a lot of killing
going on still. Stop it? When we can!"

"But how about killing them on land?" Colin asked. "You do that, I know,
because I've read that the Bureau of Fisheries even looks after the
selling of the skins. While it may be all right, it looks to me as
though you were killing them off, anyhow. What's the good of saving them
in the water if you wipe them out when they get ashore."

"You don't understand!" his friend said. "Got anything to do right now?"

"Not so far as I know," Colin answered.

"You've had breakfast?"

"Yes, thanks," the boy answered, "and I tell you it tasted good after a
night in the boat."

"Come over to the rookery," the assistant agent said. "I'm going. I
count the seals every day. That is, as nearly as I can. Tell you all
about it. If you like, we'll go on to the killing grounds afterwards.
Yes? Put on your hat."

Colin realized that his host seldom had a listener, and as he was really
anxious to learn all that he could about the fur seals, these creatures
that kept up the deafening roar that sounded like Niagara, he followed
interestedly.

"Looks a little as if it might clear," he suggested, as they left the
house. "We could stand some sunshine after this fog."

The other shook his head.

"Don't want sunshine," he said. "Fog's much better."

"What for?" asked Colin in surprise. "Why should any one want fog rather
than sunshine?"

"Fur seals do," was the emphatic response. "No seals on any other groups
of islands in the North Pacific. Just here and Commander Islands. Why?"

"Because they are foggier than others?" hazarded Colin at a guess.

"Exactly. Fur seals live in the water nearly all year. Water is colder
than air. Seals are warm-blooded animals, too--not like fish. They've
got to keep out the cold."

"Is that why they have such fine fur?"

"Obviously. And," the Fisheries official continued, "under that close
warm fur they have blubber. Lots of it."

"Blubber like whales?"

"Just the same. Fur and blubber keeps 'em warm in the cold water. Too
much covering for the air. Like wearing North Pole clothing at the
Equator. If the sun comes out they just about faint. On bright days the
young seals make for the water. Those that have to stay on the rookery
lie flat on their back and fan themselves. Certainly! Use their flippers
just the way a woman uses a regular fan. See 'em any time."

Colin looked incredulously at his companion.

"I'm not making it up," the other said. "They fan themselves with their
hind flippers, too. Just as easy."

"I think they must be the noisiest things alive," said Colin, putting
his fingers in his ears as they rounded the point and the full force of
the rookery tumult reached them.

"The row never stops," the assistant agent admitted. "Just as much at
night as daytime. Seals are used to swimming under water where light is
dimmer. Darkness makes little difference. Seemingly! Don't notice it
after a while."

"The queer part of it is," the boy said, listening intently, "that there
seem to be all sorts of different noises. It's just as I said coming
into the bay, it sounds like a menagerie. I'm sure I can hear sheep!"

"Can't tell the cry of a cow fur seal from the bleating of an old
sheep," was the reply. "The pup seal 'baa-s' just like a lamb, too.
Funny, sometimes. On one of the smaller islands one year we had a flock
of sheep. Caused us all sorts of trouble. The sheep would come running
into the seal nurseries looking for their lambs when they heard a pup
seal crying. The lambs would mistake the cry of the cow seal for the
bleating of their mothers."

"Why do you call the mother seal a cow seal?" asked the boy.

"Usual name," was the reply.

"Then why is a baby seal a pup?" asked Colin bewildered. "I should think
it ought to be called a calf!"

The Fisheries official laughed.

"Seal language is the most mixed-up lingo I know," he said. "Mother
seal is called a 'cow,' yet the baby is called a 'pup.' The cow seals
are kept in a 'harem,' which usually means a group of wives. The whole
gathering is called a 'rookery,' though there are no rooks or other
birds around. The big 'bull' seals are sometimes called 'Sea-Catches' or
'Beachmasters.' The two-year-olds and three-year-olds are called
'Bachelors.' The 'pups,' too, have their 'nurseries' to play in."

But Colin still looked puzzled.

"Our gunner was talking about 'holluschickie'?" he said. "Are those a
different kind of seal?"

"No," was the reply, "that's the old Russian-native name for bachelors.
There are a lot of native words for seals, but we only use that one and
'kotickie' for the pups."

"If the cow seals bleat," said Colin, "and the pups 'baa' like a lamb,
what is the cry of the beachmaster?"

"He makes the most noise," the agent said. "Never stops. Can you hear a
long hoarse roar? Sounds like a lion!"

"Of course I can hear it," the boy answered; "I thought that must be a
sea-lion."

"A sea-lion's cry is deeper and not so loud," his friend replied. "No.
That roar is the bull seal's challenge. You're near enough to hear a
sort of gurgling growl?"

"Yes," said Colin, "I can catch it quite clearly."

"That's a bull talking to himself. Then there's a whistle when a fight
is going on. When they're fighting, too, they have a spitting cough.
Sounds like a locomotive starting on a heavy grade. Precisely!"

"Do they fight much?" the boy asked.

"Ever so often!" his informant replied. "Can't you hear the puffing?
That shows there's a fight going on. I've seldom seen a rookery without
a mix-up in progress. That is, during the early part of the season after
the cows have started to haul up. --Abraham S. Miller.( assignor to

"The killing-grounds are always
near the salt-houses. What's that? The smell? Worst smell in the world,
I thought, when I first came here. You can't kill seals in the same
place year after year and just leave the flesh to rot without having a
frightful odor. One gets used to it after a while."

"It seems to me that you're running the risk of starting up a plague or
something!"

"No," was the reply, "it has never caused any sickness here. Then the
drive is small now to what it used to be. Time was when three or four
thousand seals would be driven, where we only take a couple of hundred
now. Fallen off terribly! Fifty years ago, every available inch of all
the beach was rookery, settled as thick as in the rookery you saw just
now. The holluschickie were here in uncounted millions. These hills, now
overgrown with grass, show the soil matted with fine hair and fur where
the seals shed their coats for hundreds of years. Now a few scattered
rookeries are all that remain."

"Do you suppose the seal herd will ever be as big again?" the boy asked.

The agent shook his head.

"I'm afraid not. The governments interested won't keep up the
international agreement long enough," he said regretfully. "It would
take thirty or forty years. Yet it would be worth it. You see," he
continued, "this is absolutely the only place in the world where the
true Alaskan fur seal--the sea bear, as it used to be called, because it
isn't a seal at all--can be found. The fur seals on the Russian islands
are a different species. Those on the Japanese islands are different
from both."

"You say a fur seal isn't a seal at all?" asked Colin. "What's the
difference?"

"Not the same at all. Different, entirely. Don't even belong to the same
group of animal. They look differently. Their habits are unlike. Oh,
they're dissimilar in every way."

"Just how?" asked Colin curiously.

"In the first place, the sexes of the hair or common seal are the same
size, not like the fur seal, where the sea-catch is four or five times
bigger than the female. Then they don't breed in harems and the male
hair seal does not stay on shore. A fur seal swims with his fore
flippers, a true seal with his hind flippers. A fur seal stands upright
on his fore flippers, a hair seal lies supine. A fur seal has a neck, a
hair seal has practically none. A fur seal naturally has fur, the hair
seal has no undercoat whatever. A pup fur seal is black, a pup hair seal
is white. Different? Obviously! Pity the old name 'sea bear' died out.
It would have prevented confusion between fur seal and true seal."

With this beginning, the agent passed into a detailed description of the
anatomy of the two different kinds of seal, and wound up with an earnest
panegyric of his fur seal family. By the time the agent had completed
his earnest defense of the sea bear, lest it should be confused with the
more common seal, the two had reached the killing-grounds, where the
natives were awaiting the agent's word to begin their work. He stepped
up to the foreman of the gang and with him looked over the first 'pod'
of about fifty that had been selected for killing, noting one or two
that looked either too young or too old or with fur in bad condition,
and these points settled, he gave the word to begin.

The 'pod' of seals was surrounded by eight men, each armed with a club
about five and a half feet long, the thickness of a baseball bat at one
end and three inches in diameter at the other. Behind him, each of the
natives had laid his stabbing-knife, skinning-knife, and whetstone. At
the word the killing began. Each native brought down his club
simultaneously, the first blow invariably crushing the slight, thin
bones of the fur seal's skull and stretching it out unconscious. The six
or seven seals that fell to each man's share were clubbed in less than a
minute for the lot.

The Aleuts then dropped their clubs and dragged out the stunned seals so
that no one of them touched another, and taking their stabbing-knives,
drove them into the hearts of the seals between the fore flippers. In no
case did Colin see any evidence that the seal had felt a moment's
suffering.

"Now," said the agent, "watch this, if you like seeing skilful work.
Skinning has got to be done rapidly. Precisely! Else the seal will
'heat' and spoil the fur."

Watching the native nearest to him, Colin noticed that he rolled the
seal over, balancing it squarely on its back. Then he made half a dozen
sweeping strokes--all so expert and accurate that not a slip was made
with the knife, nor was any blubber left on the skin. In less than two
minutes, by the watch, he had skinned the seal, leaving on the carcass
nothing but a small patch of the upper lip where the stiff mustache
grows, the insignificant tail, and the coarse hide of the flippers.

The whole sight was a good deal like butchery, and Colin felt a little
uncomfortable. Moreover, he was not hardened to the odor arising from
the blubber of the seal. He beat a retreat.

"I beg your pardon, Mr. Nagge," he called, holding his handkerchief to
his nose, "but that's too much for me."

The agent turned and noticed his departure. He called back to the boy:

"Do you see that low hill? To the right of that ruined hut?"

"Yes," Colin responded.

"Just below that are some sea-lions! Go and take a look at them. I'll
join you as soon as we are through here. Won't be long. But you'll have
to stalk them to the leeward if you want to get close," he added,
"they're shy. I'll meet you there and we'll go back to dinner. You
ought to be hungry by then."

"I will be, then," Colin responded cheerfully, adding under his breath,
as he glanced back over his shoulder at the killing-grounds, "but I'm
not now!"

A short walk through the long moss a-glitter with wild flowers, poppies,
harebells, monkshood, and a host of sub-Arctic species, brought the lad
to the top of the hill. There he paused a moment, to look over the
island, treeless save for dwarf willows six inches high and a
ground-dwelling form of crowberry. Below him, and some distance away,
were the sea-lions, but even from that coign of vantage they looked so
big and menacing that Colin wondered whether they might not stalk him,
instead of his stalking them.

After a little scrambling, however, he found himself at the bottom of
the cliff, and made his way as carefully as he could to the sea-lion
rookery. But when he did come near and rounded a large boulder in order
to get a fair view, he was inclined to think that shyness was the last
idea he would have gained from the looks of sea-lions. Near him, almost
erect on his fore flippers, was an old bull, a tremendous creature, well
over six feet in height and weighing not less than fifteen hundred
pounds.

Apart from size, he was a much more vicious-looking creature than the
sea-catch; the tawny chest and grizzled mane gave him a true lion-like
look, and an upturned muzzle showed the sharp teeth glistening white
against the almost black tongue, while a small wicked, bulldog eye
glittered at the intruder. The female sea-lion, near by, was almost as
large as a six-year-old bull seal.

Wanting to see something happen, and realizing from the build of the
sea-lion that he could not make much progress on land, Colin threw a
stone at a pup sea-lion who was asleep on a rock close by.

But the boy was utterly unprepared for the result, for no sooner did the
huge sea-lion realize his advance as he strode forward to throw the
stone, than it was smitten with panic. When, moreover, it heard the
'crack' of the pebble as it hit a rock behind him, the cowardly creature
went wild with fear, and made convulsive and clumsy efforts to reach the
water ten feet away, tumbling down twice in doing so, and finally
plunging into the ocean trembling as though with ague. At the alarm,
the entire rookery took flight, leaving the pups behind, sprawling on
the rocks. The parents ranged up in a line about fifty feet from shore
and remained at that safe distance as long as Colin was in sight. He
watched the pups for a little while, but they were not nearly as
interesting as seals, and he was quite ready to go when his friend
hailed him from the top of the hill.

"Sea-lions look sort of human in the water, don't they?" remarked Colin
as he rejoined his friend, and turned for a farewell glance at the
creatures with their upright heads and shoulders and inquisitive look.

"The Aleuts say they are," his friend replied. "They declare their
ancestors were sea-lions or seals. That's a general belief on the north
coast of Scotland and in the Hebrides, too."

"That men came from seals?"

"Certainly. What do you suppose started all the mermaid stories? Round
head, soft tender eyes, and a fish's tail? Seals! Obviously! And, if you
notice old pictures of mermaids the tail is drawn as if it were split in
two, just like the two long flippers of the seal."

"I never thought of that before," said the boy.

"You've heard of the Orforde merman, of course, haven't you?"

Colin admitted his ignorance.

"Queer yarn. Quite true, though," the agent said. "Documents show it. It
happened off the coast of Suffolk, England. About the end of the twelfth
century, I think. Some fishermen caught a creature which they described
as being like an old man with long gray hair, but which had a fish's
tail. It could live out of the water just as well as in it. They brought
it to the Earl of Orforde. In spite of all their efforts they could not
teach the merman to speak. Naturally! So the priest of the parish
suggested that perhaps the creature had something to do with the devil.
Characteristic of the time! So they took the 'merman' to church. But it
showed no sign of adoration and didn't seem to understand the
ceremonies. So they were convinced that it was an evil thing, and put it
to the torture, hoping to extract a confession from--a seal!"

"But there are mermaids!" said Colin. "I've seen 'em. Not alive, of
course, but stuffed."

"So have I," the agent said, laughing; "that was a trick the Japanese
used and fooled a lot of people. Why, there was one in a museum in
Boston for years! It was a fake, of course. Obviously!"

"How did they do it?"

"Head and shoulders of a newly-born monkey fastened to a fish's body. I
forget now what fish. Then with incredible pains, they laid rows upon
rows of fish scales all over the monkey's shoulders and chest. Wonderful
work. Each scale was glued on separately, beginning from scales almost
microscopic and shading both in size and color exactly into those of the
fish hinder portion. The work was so exquisitely done that its
artificiality could not be detected. But live mermaids haven't been put
in any aquarium. Not yet!"

"I don't suppose there's even a water-baby left!" the boy said,
laughing.

"No," was the reply. "We couldn't give it any milk now, the sea-cows
have been all killed off."

"Sea-cows?"

"Big creatures, bigger even than walruses. Lots of them here some time.
We find their bones everywhere. Nearly all our sled-runners are made of
sea-cow bones. They grazed like cattle below water on the seaweeds of
the shore and the natives used to spear them at low tide."

[Illustration: CATCH OF HERRING ON BEACH AT GASTINEAU CHANNEL, ALASKA.

_Courtesy of the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries._]

"Are there walruses here, too?"

"I saw three a few years ago, but none since. About two hundred miles
north of here, however, on St. Matthew's Island, there used to be scores
of them. But I reckon hunters and polar bears, between them, have
destroyed most of them."

"Do polar bears come here in winter?"

The agent shook his head.

"The Pribilof Islands are not cold enough for a polar bear. Besides he
likes walrus meat better than seal. Bear eats a lot of fish, too."

"I thought they lived almost entirely on seals."

"They couldn't very well," was the reply. "Seal is a better swimmer than
a bear, although the polar bear is a marvel in the water for a land
animal and can overhaul a walrus. The big white fellows only catch seal
when basking on the ice. They get a good many that way. The hunters have
left nothing to the Pribilofs except the fur seal and the sea-lion, and
not many of those. And unless we can find a way to stop the
seal-pirates, those will soon be gone, too."

"Do you have much trouble with that sort of thing?" the boy asked.

"A lot nearly every year. We won't have so much of it now. Great
Britain, Japan, Russia, and the United States are united in the desire
to prevent pelagic sealing. Good thing, too. A treaty has been signed,
forbidding it for fifteen years. So you see, a seal poacher on the
rookeries finds everybody against him."

"Wasn't there a lot of trouble some years ago?" Colin asked. "I heard
that there was real fighting here."

"Indeed there was, and lots of it! No one, not even the United States
Government, ever knew how much. While the islands were leased to a
private company the beaches were patrolled by riflemen. Russian and
Japanese schooners frequently sent off boatloads of armed men during a
fog, to kill as many seals as possible, protecting their men by gunfire.
Among the latter have been Professor I.

The opposition that some of the the year The Menorah Society at our
University is in a unique position.

The number of Jews in North Carolina is the smallest of any in the Southern
States.

Only in a few places is there any organized Jewish life. The Jewish
students come chiefly from such places where the number of Jews is very
small.

Under these circumstances, it can readily be seen how difficult it
was at first to implant the idea of a Jewish society for the purpose
of the study of Jewish subjects of which the majority of the has
succeeded in its endeavor.

The relation of the Menorah Society here with the Y. M. C. A. is one
of heartiest co-operation.

LILLIAN H. ROSENBLUM New York University In the first number of THE MENORAH
JOURNAL it was reported that because of the division of New York
University into uptown and downtown colleges, it was found necessary
to organize an additional Menorah Society at Washington Square, the
downtown section.

This Washington Square Society has for its sphere the professional
schools of The Jewish Messianic," Idea," L. J.

events were given second undergraduate Bowdoin Prize at Harvard.) Honorable

from the University Library and the Menorah Library.

The value of our study of Jewish history may be educed from the fact
that most of us had but the faintest of our glorious past. When a
thorough. cognition of the text was acquired, discussions and studies
of different phases and movements in Judaism were taken up. In this work
the Menorah Library proved an especially Over eighty percent
of the members are young men and women who work during the day and
devote five evenings a minutes week to school. The Society has conducted
under its auspices in the past year about lectures, at which the
attendance averaged seventy-five members.

The lectures covered many phases of Jewish culture and were greatly

"It was a bully hold-up," said Colin delightedly, "one against six."

"Had to," said the sailor, "or the six would have made mincemeat o' the
one. Besides, I had to give the tide a chance to get that boat out o'
the way. After I held 'em a few minutes I knew it was all right, because
they had no boat, their own bein' adrift without oars."

"Big lie," said the Japanese leader placidly, "we shipwreck sailors,
nothing to do with that ship at all. This man tell story about boat--we
not know anything of that boat. Our boat sunk on rocks, away over
there!"

He pointed to the other side of the island.

"But you were killing seals!" protested the agent.

"Yes," said the Japanese, "we think islands have not any person on. Need
food, we kill. Of course."

"Clever," said the agent, turning to Hank. "This isn't as simple as it
looks. We have no direct evidence that these men belonged to that
schooner."

"But we know they did!" said the whaler emphatically.

"Of course," agreed the agent. "But we can't prove it. Law demands
proof. If we only had that boat, with the schooner's name on, it would
serve."

Suddenly there came a hail from the crippled launch which was being
brought in under oars.

"Mr. Nagge there?"

"Yes, Svenson," was the reply, "what is it?"

"They smashed our engine all to bits," answered the engineer of the
boat, "but we've just picked up another boat, empty."

"That's the boat," said the agent with satisfaction in his voice. "Now
we've got them!"

A smile, a very faint smile, crossed the features of the Japanese
leader.

"What's the name on the stern of the boat?" the agent called.

There was a moment's pause, then came the answer in tones of deep
disgust:

"The name's been painted out!"

The agent looked round despairingly and caught Colin's look of sympathy.

"The slippery Oriental again!" the boy said.

"Not quite slippery enough this time, though," said Hank in a voice
which betrayed a discovery.

"What do you mean?" asked the agent.

"Uncle Sam's gettin' into the game," he answered, pointing out to sea.

"The revenue cutter?"

"Hm, hm," grunted the whaler in assent, "I reckon I can see her lights."

No one else could see anything in the fog and darkness, but a minute or
two later there came a flash, followed by a dull "boom."

Hank turned to the Japanese leader.

"Pity to spoil that yarn o' yours," he said, "but your ship can't run
away from quick-firin' guns without a wind."


CHAPTER IV

CATCHING THE SEA-SERPENT


There was great excitement in the village the next day when the revenue
cutter brought in the Japanese raiding schooner and her crew. The boat
that had successfully reached the ship had already begun to load her
quota of sealskins, and the men had not thrown them overboard, believing
that they could get away. Consequently, with the evidence of the raid
ashore and with the seals in the boat belonging to the schooner from
which witnesses had seen the crew go on board, the case was complete.

"What are you going to do with the prisoners?" asked Colin. "Are you
going to put them on trial here?"

"Not here," the agent replied. "The Federal Courts look after that."

"But I thought you were a judge," the boy protested. "Who administers
justice on the islands?"

"The chief agent," was the reply. "He is a magistrate. All the natives
are employees of the Fisheries Bureau. He has a lot of authority over
them. Obviously! But any really grave case is tried at Valdez, because
that's the nearest Federal court from here. Sealing questions, too, are
so confused with international issues that we don't undertake to decide
them."

"And what will happen to the schooner?"

"A prize crew will be put aboard. Take her to Unalaska. The revenue
cutter will pick them up afterwards. Probably start for Valdez without
delay. Captain Murchison said this morning that he wanted to go along."

"I wonder if I'll have to go?" said Colin. "I'm sure I don't want to, at
least, not yet. There's ever so much more that I want to find out about
seals, and I've hardly started. If I'm ever lucky enough to get into the
Bureau of Fisheries, I hope I shall have a chance to get something to do
on this fur seal service."

"Fur seal's very important. But only a small part of the Bureau of
Fisheries," the agent said, and outlined to Colin the general workings
of the Bureau, in which he showed the practical value of the work.

"I know. I want to join the Bureau," the boy persisted, "not only
because I think there's more fun in it than in anything else, but
because I like everything about it."

"What do your folks say about the plan?" the Fisheries agent queried.

"They know I want it," the lad replied, "but I never felt that I knew
enough about the Bureau to say that I didn't care to do anything else.
Father's always wanted me to take up lumbering or forestry or sawmills
or something to do with timber. He's quite a big lumberman, you know.
But, some way, that never appealed to me."

"Your father ought to know," the other said. "Obviously! And if he owns
timber lands, I think it's up to you to be a help. Lots of interesting
angles to the lumber business. And if the timber lands are going to
descend to you, you'll have to look after them, anyway."

"But they won't," objected Colin; "that's just it. In about ten years
that timber will be all cut off. I'm pretty sure Father will let me join
the Bureau," the boy continued, "because he's wild about fishing
himself. Why, just now, he's down at Santa Catalina, angling for big
game."

"Some difference between the Fisheries Bureau and angling for sport,"
the agent warned him. "I've been in the business all my life. But I've
never even learned to cast a fly! It's a serious business, and down in
Washington you'll find that the value of the work to the people of the
United States is the chief aim of the Bureau."

"It may be serious, but I should think that there is always something
new. And, anyway," Colin said enthusiastically, "fishes are ever so much
more interesting than animals. There are such heaps of different kinds,
too!"

"The interest in work depends on how you look at it," soberly responded
the agent. "Obviously! But don't think the Bureau is experimenting with
every kind of fish in the ocean. There are only a few food fishes or
forms with commercial value that are exploited at all."

"But you were describing to me, only yesterday, the way they handle
millions of baby fishes annually. I've just got to get into the Bureau."

"Go ahead, then. I don't doubt we'll be glad to have you. I've done my
best to show you what you'll have to face," the official declared, "and
if you're still eager for it, why, go in and win. There's always a place
somewhere for the chap who is really anxious to work."

"We may judge how great was the improvement which these contrivances
introduced into the art of observing," says Whewell, "by finding that
Hevelius refused to adopt them because they would make all the old
observations of no value. He had spent a laborious and active life
in the exercise of the old methods, and could not bear to think that all
the treasures which he had accumulated had lost their worth by the discovery
of a new mine of richer ones

."[1]
Until the time of Newton, all the telescopes in use were either of the
Galilean or Keplerian type, that is, refractors. But about the year 1670
Newton constructed his first reflecting telescope, which was greatly
superior to, although much smaller than, the telescopes then in use.
He was led to this invention by his experiments with light and colors.
In 1671 he presented to the Royal Society a second and somewhat larger
telescope, which he had made; and this type of instrument was little
improved upon until the introduction of the achromatic telescope, invented
by Chester Moor Hall in 1733.

As is generally known, the element of accurate measurements of time
plays an important part in the measurements of the movements of the
heavenly bodies.

In fact, one was scarcely possible without the other, and as it
happened it was the same man, Huygens, who perfected Kepler's
telescope and invented the pendulum clock.

The general idea had been suggested by Galileo; or, better perhaps,
the equal time occupied by the successive oscillations of the
pendulum had been noted by him.

He had not been able, however, to put this discovery to practical
account.

But in 1656 Huygens invented the necessary machinery for maintaining
the motion of the pendulum and perfected several accurate clocks.

These clocks were of invaluable assistance to the astronomers, affording
as they did a means of keeping time "more accurate than the sun
itself."

When Picard had corrected the variation caused by heat and cold acting
upon the pendulum rod by combining metals of different degrees of
expansibility, a high degree of accuracy was possible.

But while the pendulum clock was an unequalled stationary time-piece,
it was useless in such unstable situations as, for example, on shipboard.
But here again Huygens played a prominent part by first applying the
coiled balance-spring for regulating watches and marine clocks. The
idea of applying a spring to the balance-wheel was not original with
Huygens, however, as it had been first conceived by Robert Hooke; but
Huygens's application made practical Hooke's idea.

In England the importance of securing accurate watches or marine clocks
was so fully appreciated that a reward of L20,000 sterling was
offered by Parliament as a stimulus to the inventor of such a
time-piece.

The immediate incentive for this offer was the obvious fact that with such
an instrument the determination of the longitude of places would
be much simplified.

Encouraged by these offers, a certain carpenter named Harrison turned
his attention to the subject of watch-making, and, after many years
of labor, in 1758 produced a spring time-keeper which, during a
sea-voyage occupying one hundred and sixty-one days, varied only
one minute and five seconds.

This gained for Harrison a reward Of L5000 sterling at once, and a little
later L10,000 more, from Parliament.

While inventors were busy with the problem of accurate chronometers,
however, another instrument for taking longitude at sea had been
invented.

This was the reflecting quadrant, or sextant, as the improved
instrument is now called, invented by John Hadley in 1731, and
independently by Thomas Godfrey, a poor glazier of Philadelphia,
in 1730.

Godfrey's invention, which was constructed on the same principle
as that of the Hadley instrument, was not generally recognized until
two years after Hadley's discovery, although the instrument was
finished and actually in use on a sea-voyage some months before
Hadley reported his invention.

The principle of the sextant, however, seems to have been known to Newton,
who constructed an instrument not very unlike that of Hadley; but
this invention was lost sight of until several years after the
philosopher's death and some time after Hadley's invention.

The introduction of the sextant greatly simplified taking reckonings at
sea as well as facilitating taking the correct longitude of distant
places.

Before that time the mariner was obliged to depend upon his compass, a
cross-staff, or an astrolabe, a table of the sun's declination and a
correction for the altitude of the polestar, and very inadequate and
incorrect charts. Such were the instruments used by Columbus and Vasco
da Gama and their immediate successors.

During the Newtonian period the microscopes generally in use were
those constructed of simple lenses, for although compound microscopes
were known, the difficulties of correcting aberration had not been
surmounted, and a much clearer field was given by the simple
instrument.

The results obtained by the use of such instruments, however, were very
satisfactory in many ways. By referring to certain plates in this volume,
which reproduce illustrations from Robert Hooke's work on the microscope,
it will be seen that quite a high degree of effectiveness had been
attained. And it should be recalled that Antony von Leeuwenboek, whose
death took place shortly before Newton's, had discovered such micro-organisms
as bacteria, had seen the blood corpuscles in circulation, and examined
and described other microscopic structures of the body.

XIV. PROGRESS IN ELECTRICITY FROM GILBERT AND VON GUERICKE TO FRANKLIN

We have seen how Gilbert, by his experiments with magnets, gave an impetus
to the study of magnetism and electricity.

Gilbert himself demonstrated some facts and advanced some theories,
but the system of general laws was to come later.

To this end the discovery of electrical repulsion, as well as attraction,
by Von Guericke, with his sulphur ball, was a step forward; but
something like a century passed after Gilbert's beginning before
anything of much importance was done in the field of electricity.

In 1705, however, Francis Hauksbee began a series of experiments that
resulted in some startling demonstrations. For many years it had been
observed that a peculiar light was seen sometimes in the mercurial
barometer, but Hauksbee and the other scientific investigators
supposed the radiance to be due to the mercury in a vacuum, brought
about, perhaps, by some agitation.

That this light might have any connection with electricity did not,
at first, occur to Hauksbee any more than it had to his predecessors.

The problem that interested him was whether the vacuum in the tube
of the barometer was essential to the light; and in experimenting to
determine this, he invented his "mercurial fountain."

Having exhausted the air in a receiver containing some mercury, he
found that by allowing air to rush through the mercury the metal
became a jet thrown in all directions against the sides of the
vessel, making a great, flaming shower, "like flashes of lightning,"
as he said.

But it seemed to him that there was a difference between this light and
the glow noted in the barometer. This was a bright light, whereas the
barometer light was only a glow.

Pondering over this, Hauksbee tried various experiments, revolving pieces
of amber, flint, steel, and other substances in his exhausted
air-pump receiver, with negative, or unsatisfactory, results.

Finally, it occurred to him to revolve an exhausted glass tube itself.
Mounting such a globe of glass on an axis so that it could be revolved
rapidly by a belt running on a large wheel, he found that by holding
his fingers against the whirling globe a purplish glow appeared,
giving sufficient light so that coarse print could be read, and the walls
of a dark room sensibly lightened several feet away. As air was admitted
to the globe the light gradually diminished, and it seemed to him that
this diminished glow was very similar in appearance to the pale light
seen in the mercurial barometer. Could it be that it was the glass,
and not the mercury, that caused it? Going to a barometer he proceeded
to rub the glass above the column of mercury over the vacuum, without
disturbing the mercury, when, to his astonishment, the same faint
light, to all appearances identical with the glow seen in the
whirling globe, was produced.

Turning these demonstrations over in his mind, he recalled the
well-known fact that rubbed glass attracted bits of paper, leaf-brass,
and other light substances, and that this phenomenon was supposed
to be electrical.

This led him finally to determine the hitherto unsuspected fact, that the
glow in the barometer was electrical as was also the glow seen in
his whirling globe.
Continuing his investigations, he soon discovered that solid glass rods
when rubbed produced the same effects as the tube.

By mere chance, happening to hold a rubbed tube to his cheek, he felt
the effect of electricity upon the skin like "a number of fine,
limber hairs," and this suggested to him that, since the mysterious
manifestation was so plain, it could be made to show its effects
upon various substances.

Suspending some woollen threads over the whirling glass cylinder, he
found that as soon as he touched the glass with his hands the threads,
which were waved about by the wind of the revolution, suddenly
straightened themselves in a peculiar manner, and stood in a radical
position, pointing to the axis of the cylinder.

Encouraged by these successes, he continued his experiments with
breathless expectancy, and soon made another important discovery,
that of "induction," although the real significance of this discovery
was not appreciated by him or, for that matter, by any one else for
several generations following.

This discovery was made by placing two revolving cylinders within
an inch of each other, one with the air exhausted and the other
unexhausted.

Placing his hand on the unexhausted tube caused the light to appear not
only upon it, but on the other tube as well. A little later he discovered
that it is not necessary to whirl the exhausted tube to produce this
effect, but simply to place it in close proximity to the other whirling
cylinder.

These demonstrations of Hauksbee attracted wide attention and gave
an impetus to investigators in the field of electricity; but still
no great advance was made for something like a quarter of a century.

Possibly the energies of the scientists were exhausted for the moment
in exploring the new fields thrown open to investigation by the
colossal work of Newton.

THE EXPERIMENTS OF STEPHEN GRAY

In 1729 Stephen Gray (died in 1736), an eccentric and irascible old
pensioner of the Charter House in London, undertook some investigations
along lines similar to those of Hauksbee.

While experimenting with a glass tube for producing electricity, as
Hauksbee had done, he noticed that the corks with which he had stopped
the ends of the tube to exclude the dust, seemed to attract bits
of paper and leaf-brass as well as the glass itself.

He surmised at once that this mysterious electricity, or "virtue," as
it was called, might be transmitted through other substances as
it seemed to be through glass.

"Having by me an ivory ball of about one and three-tenths of an inch in
diameter," he writes, "with a hole through it, this I fixed upon a
fir-stick about four inches long, thrusting the other end into the cork,
and upon rubbing the tube found that the ball attracted and repelled the
feather with more vigor than the cork had done, repeating its attractions
and repulsions for many times together. I then fixed the ball on longer
sticks, first upon one of eight inches, and afterwards upon one of
twenty-four inches long, and found the effect the same. Then I made
use of iron, and then brass wire, to fix the ball on, inserting the
other end of the wire in the cork, as before, and found that the
attraction was the same as when the fir-sticks were made use of,
and that when the feather was held over against any part of the
wire it was attracted by it; but though it was then nearer the tube,
yet its attraction was not so strong as that of the ball.

When the wire of two or three feet long was used, its vibrations, caused
by the rubbing of the tube, made it somewhat troublesome to be
managed.

This put me to thinking whether, if the ball was hung by a pack-thread
and suspended by a loop on the tube, the electricity would not be
carried down the line to the ball; I found it to succeed accordingly;
for upon suspending the ball on the tube by a pack-thread about three
feet long, when the tube had been excited by rubbing, the ivory
ball attracted and repelled the leaf-brass over which it was held
as freely as it had done when it was suspended on sticks or wire,
as did also a ball of cork, and another of lead that weighed one
pound and a quarter."

Gray next attempted to determine what other bodies would attract
the bits of paper, and for this purpose he tried coins, pieces of
metal, and even a tea-kettle, "both empty and filled with hot or
cold water"; but he found that the attractive power appeared to be
the same regardless of the substance used.

"I next proceeded," he continues, "to try at what greater distances
the electric virtues might be carried, and having by me a hollow
walking-cane, which I suppose was part of a fishing-rod, two feet seven
inches long, I cut the great end of it to fit into the bore of the
tube, into which it went about five inches; then when the cane was put
into the end of the tube, and this excited, the cane drew the
leaf-brass to the height of more than two inches, as did also the
ivory ball, when by a cork and stick it had been fixed to the end
of the cane....

With several pieces of Spanish cane and fir-sticks I afterwards
made a rod, which, together with the tube, was somewhat more than
eighteen feet long, which was the greatest length I could conveniently
use in my chamber, and found the attraction very nearly, if not
altogether, as strong as when the ball was placed on the shorter
rods."

This experiment exhausted the capacity of his small room, but on going
to the country a little later he was able to continue his experiments.
"To a pole of eighteen feet there was tied a line of thirty-four feet
in length, so that the pole and line together were fifty-two
feet. With the pole and tube I stood in the balcony, the assistant
below in the court, where he held the board with the leaf-brass on
it. Then the tube being excited, as usual, the electric virtue
passed from the tube up the pole and down the line to the ivory ball,
which attracted the leaf-brass, and as the ball passed over it in its
vibrations the leaf-brass would follow it till it was carried off the
board."

Gray next attempted to send the electricity over a line suspended
horizontally.

To do this he suspended the pack-thread by pieces of string looped
over nails driven into beams for that purpose.
But when thus suspended he found that the ivory ball no longer excited
the leaf-brass, and he guessed correctly that the explanation of this
lay in the fact that "when the electric virtue came to the loop that was
suspended on the beam it went up the same to the beam," none of it
reaching the ball. As we shall see from what follows, however, Gray
had not as yet determined that certain substances will conduct
electricity while others will not.

But by a lucky accident he made the discovery that silk, for example,
was a poor conductor, and could be turned to account in insulating
the conducting-cord.

A certain Mr. Wheler had become much interested in the old pensioner
and his work, and, as a guest at the Wheler house, Gray had been repeating
some of his former experiments with the fishing-rod, line, and ivory
ball. He had finally exhausted the heights from which these experiments
could be made by climbing to the clock-tower and exciting bits of
leaf-brass on the ground below.

"As we had no greater heights here," he says, "Mr.

Wheler was desirous to try whether we could not carry the electric
virtue horizontally. I then told him of the attempt I had made with
that design, but without success, telling him the method and materials
made use of, as mentioned above. He then proposed a silk line to
support the line by which the electric virtue was to pass. I told him
it might do better upon account of its smallness; so that there would
be less virtue carried from the line of communication.

"The first experiment was made in the matted gallery, July 2, 1729,
about ten in the morning.

About four feet from the end of the gallery there was a cross line that
was fixed by its ends to each side of the gallery by two nails;
the middle part of the line was silk, the rest at each end pack-thread;
then the line to which the ivory ball was hung and by which the
electric virtue was to be conveyed to it from the tube, being eighty
and one-half feet in length, was laid on the cross silk line, so
that the ball hung about nine feet below it.

So, it is imperative that some fish be allowed to go
up-stream, or in other words, that salmon-catchers allow a certain
proportion to escape their wheels and nets."

"They ought to be willing enough to do that, I should think," said
Colin; "it's for their own good in the long run."

"A lot of them want quick profits now, without any regard for the
future," his host said scornfully. "Of course, there are laws for
fishery regulation in many of the States, but inspectors have their
hands full in preventing violations. In Alaska, which is a territory
still, that supervision is done by the government through the Bureau of
Fisheries."

"It must be a little aggravating to the salmon men, just the same," said
Colin thoughtfully, "when they are trying to keep their canning
factories going full blast, to have to allow half the catch to go on up
the stream. But," he continued, "why don't they catch the salmon coming
down the stream again? I should think that would settle the whole
question."

"It would," said the professor, "if they came down! But they don't.
Every single salmon, male and female, that goes up the river in the
spawning season dies up there. None of them ever comes down alive."

"I don't think they did that way in Newfoundland!" ejaculated Colin in
surprise. "When I was staying with my uncle there I saw lots of salmon,
and it seemed to me that they went down the river again."

"They did," was the reply. "The Atlantic or true salmon does not die
after spawning, but not a single fish of any one of the five different
kinds of Pacific salmon ever spawns twice. Every yard of the shores of
the upper reaches of Pacific coast rivers is covered almost solidly with
dead salmon from September to December!"

"How awful!"

"It makes some places uninhabitable," the professor replied. "Where a
market is near enough, the dead fish are collected and sold for
fertilizer."

"Is it the fresh water that kills them?"

"No," was the reply; "that is one of the most curious features of the
life-history of the Pacific salmon. As soon as the fish are nearly ready
for spawning, all their digestive parts shrivel up, so that they can't
eat. In the male salmon, too, the end of the upper lip turns into a sort
of hook so that the fish can't even open his mouth wide enough to eat
anything. Then in the fresh water their scales turn slimy and, as they
often get injured trying to leap falls and rapids, all sorts of skin
diseases attack them. A salmon in the upper reaches of the Columbia
headwaters is a pitiful wreck of the magnificent fish that entered it to
spawn."

"Do they go far?"

"As much as a thousand miles," was the reply. "The quinnat and blue
back--or the spring and the sockeye, as they are generally known, take
the long journeys, but the silver or coho, and the humpback and dog
salmon keep to the small streams near the sea. The young fry cannot live
in salt water and the instinct of the salmon is to swim up-stream as far
as possible, no matter what obstacle is in the way. When they have gone
to the very limit, the salmon make pits and holes in the gravel and sand
at the bottom of the stream for nests, and drop the eggs in these. The
male salmon immediately afterwards floats over the nests and does his
share in making sure that the eggs will hatch out."

"How big are the salmon?" asked the boy.

"You'll have a chance to see," the professor answered, as he swung the
canoe in to the wharf, at the state hatchery station, "because we're
going to measure the ones we tag this morning."

The foreman and one of the men of the station were waiting for them in a
good-sized motor boat, towing behind which was a curious-looking affair
composed of two small barrels fastened together by long slats.

"Don't you know what that is?" queried the professor, noting Colin's
puzzled look.

"No, sir."

"That's a live car. The barrels at each end have enough water in them to
sink them to a certain depth. Then the slats, as you see, are nailed
two-thirds of the way around the barrels, leaving just enough space for
the water to flow in and out freely. They put the fish in that to tow
them home alive. The slats are better than netting because sometimes the
fishes catch their scales in the meshes and get hurt."

The run to the fish-trap was made in a few minutes, and the boat went
inside to the 'pound,' the net was partly hauled up, and the professor
took out his punch and the buttons. Colin had put on a pair of rubber
boots and oilskin trousers, as had all the rest of the party, and he was
ready for anything that came along.

"Do you want my slicker?" the professor asked him. "You're apt to get
splashed."

"I don't mind a bit, thanks," answered the boy, rolling up his sleeves;
"a little shower-bath will feel good on a hot day like this!"

"All right, then," the leader of the party declared, "we'll give you a
chance to make yourself useful. Here you are!"

Colin took the large flat-bottomed net and awaited further instructions.

"Catch one of the salmon," he was told; "never mind the rest of the
fish. And," he was warned, "don't bring the net clear out of the water."

"Very well, sir," the boy replied, then his curiosity getting the better
of him, he asked, "Why not?"

"Because if you do, the salmon will struggle against the meshes of the
net, bruise himself, and probably scrape off some scales. I told you how
easy it is for a fish to get diseased if he loses any of his scales. If
you keep the net about four inches below the water, the fish has the
resistance of the water to fight against, and it will tire him out
quickly without doing any harm."

"All right," Colin answered, and commenced scooping for the fish. In a
minute or two he had a large twenty-pounder in the net and he raised it
until the bottom was a little below the water, as he had been told.

"You're right about getting wet!" cried Colin, laughing, as the salmon
began to whirl and plunge and dance in the net, sending a shower of
water all over him and nearly blinding him by the force with which the
drops of water struck as they were splashed upwards by the powerful
strokes of the fish's tail.

The instant the salmon stopped struggling, the hatchery boatman seized
it by the tail with a strong grip, swung it clear out of the net and
over his left arm, laying it immediately on the measuring platform. This
consisted merely of a wide board with an upright at one end, a rule
giving both metrical and standard measures being nailed to the side of
the board. Instantly the measurer called out the length and the
professor noted it down, the hatchery foreman--famous for his expertness
in judging the weight of a fish--calling out the weight to be recorded.
Laying down his pencil, the professor then, with a small punch, made a
tiny hole in the tail-fin of the salmon, the fish having been thrown
over the captor's left arm again, slipped an aluminum button through the
hole, and riveted it securely. The entire process took less than a
minute and a half, and by the time the salmon had been released and
tossed into the water again, Colin was ready with another fish.

"I don't see why the fish don't die as soon as they come out of the
water!" exclaimed Colin.

"For nearly a minute, some fish breathe better out of the water than in
it," the professor answered, "but after that the gills stick together
and the fish strangles. Two or even three minutes will not injure
salmon, and some fish will recover if they are out of water for hours.
Indeed, there are some fish that live out of water most of the time."

"Live out of water?" the boy said in surprise.

"Certainly. Some kinds of fish, at least, can't stay in the water very
long, but remain perched up on the rocks."

"Perching like birds?" Colin said incredulously.

"I know that sounds a little improbable, but it's true, just the same,"
the professor said, smiling. "This is a Fisheries story, not a 'fish
story.' There's a difference. They come from Samoa and belong to the
skippy family. Most of them live on the rocks, and they jump from rock
to rock instead of swimming. Some of them even are vegetarians--which is
rare among fish--and their gills are smaller and stouter. Plenty of them
are only in the water for a little while at high tide, living in the
moist seaweed until the tide rises again."

Colin was silenced, and he went on vigorously dipping up salmon.

"How many fish are you going to tag?" the boy asked, when a couple of
hours had passed by.

"Sixty," the professor answered, "and we must be nearly through, for I
have only a few buttons left."

Secretly the boy was much relieved, for his back was tired from stooping
and netting heavy fish for two hours, but he would have worked to utter
exhaustion rather than complain. However, within another quarter of an
hour, the last fish was dropped over the side and the party was on its
return journey.

"Why don't you stop and see the hatchery?" suggested the professor, in
return to a host of questions put to him by the boy concerning salmon
culture.

"I'd like to, ever so much, if I might," was the answer, and Colin
looked up at the foreman.

"Come right along," was the latter's immediate response. "It isn't much
of a place to look at, but you can see whatever there is to see."

The hatchery itself was simple and bare, as the foreman had suggested,
consisting merely of a row of boxes arranged in such a way that water
flowed through them constantly, bringing a steady supply of fresh water
without carrying away the light eggs and tiny fry. Colin was thoroughly
interested, and followed the foreman from place to place, eagerly
watching the processes of hatching the fish and asking unending
questions.

[Illustration: HATCHERIES IN MAINE FOR LANDLOCKED SALMON.

_Courtesy of the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries._]

"Here," the man said, after he had answered a dozen or more queries.
"I'll show you just how it's done and you'll learn more from watching
than I could tell you in a week of talk."

He led the way to a large pond not far from the hatchery, which was
connected with a small stream, the water of which was almost entirely
fresh.

"It's a little early yet for the autumn run," the foreman said, "but
maybe there's some salmon ready for their eggs to be taken. We'll have a
look, anyway."

"Are there any chinook in there?" queried Colin, who was feeling a
little proud of the knowledge he had acquired that morning as to the way
of distinguishing the varieties of salmon.

"Don't want chinook," was the reply; "they have got to go away up the
river to spawn and wouldn't be in shape if we tried to use them here. We
only raise humpback and dog here, the hatcheries for chinook and silver
salmon are away up the river."

"Run by the State or the Government?" queried the boy.

"Both," was the reply, "and quite a few are managed by commercial fish
companies who are as anxious as any one to see that the annual salmon
run does not grow smaller. Their living depends upon it."

At his request one of the men commenced scooping up some of the salmon
in the pool to see if any of them were ripe, and meantime the
foreman--who was still wearing his oilskins--picked up a tin pail,
holding it between his knees. In a minute or two the man came in holding
a ripe female salmon.

"Now watch," the foreman said to Colin, "and you can see the whole
performance."

He seized the salmon by the tail, and all the eggs ran down toward the
head. Then, holding the fish head upward, he pressed it slightly, and
the eggs ran out from the vent rapidly, striking the bottom of the pan
with considerable force. The foreman had hardly got the eggs when his
assistant came in with a male salmon, and the same plan was repeated,
the milt falling upon the eggs. Both male and female salmon then were
returned to the pool. The eggs and milt were shaken violently from side
to side until thoroughly mixed, a little water being added to help the
mixture. Then he took the pail to the faucet.

"But you're washing the milt off again!" cried Colin, as the foreman
filled the pail with water.

"It's had plenty of time to work," was the answer, and the eggs were
poured into a flat pan and washed several times.

"Now we'll put just a little water in the pan," the foreman continued,
"and leave it here to swell."

"Why should it swell?" asked Colin.

"The egg isn't really full when it comes from the mother fish," the
foreman answered, "the yolk rattles around inside the shell, but after
it has been mixed with the milt, it begins to suck up water, and in
about half an hour it's full."

"What happens next?" queried Colin.

"That's about all. We put the eggs in frames so that the water has a
chance to circulate freely, and then we go over the frames once or twice
a week to pick out any eggs that may happen to die or not to grow just
right."

"How long does it take before a fish comes out?" Colin asked
interestedly. "About a couple of weeks?"

"Weeks!" was the surprised answer; "we look for hatching to begin in
about five months, and during all that time every tray of eggs is picked
over once or twice a week. That keeps dead eggs from infecting live
ones."

"You must keep them a long time, then?"

"Nearly a year altogether. Those in that trough right behind you are
just hatching, they're from the first batch of spawn in the early spring
run. Most of them are hatched out now, for you see only a few eggs in
the tray."

Colin looked in and saw, as the foreman said, only half a dozen eggs
left in the tray, while in the shallow water of the trough below were
hundreds of tiny fish, like transparent tadpoles still fastened to the
yolk of the egg. Some, which were just hatched, were less than
three-quarters of an inch long, and scarcely able to move about in the
water because of the great weight of the yolk about the center of their
bodies. A few had consumed a large part of the sac.

"It'll take them about six weeks to get rid of the yolk," the foreman
said, anticipating the boy's question, "and if they were in a natural
stream they would be able to look after themselves. We feed them tiny
grubs and worms and small pieces of liver. From that time on it is
merely a question of giving them the proper food and keeping the troughs
clean. When they are five or six months old we set them free."

"Do you do any work except salmon hatching here?" Colin asked, as, after
a morning spent in the station, they walked toward the pier.

"No," the foreman answered, "we distribute a million and a half young
fish every year and that keeps us busy enough."

"Well," said Colin, shaking hands, "I'm ever so much obliged, and I
really feel now as if I knew something about a hatchery. And I've had a
share in one experiment, anyway!"

On his return to the cottage he found the professor getting out
fishing-tackle.

"Going out again?" queried Colin.

"I thought you might like to try a little sport-fishing," was the
answer; "you said you were going down to Santa Catalina, and you might
as well get your hand in. You can stay over another day, can't you?"

As soon as the tuna was fairly secure, a big square of
canvas was thrown over it to keep it from pounding and threshing in the
bottom of the boat.

"That was bully, Father!" said Colin, reaching out and shaking hands;
"I'm glad I got here in time."

His father looked at him with a twinkle in his eye.

"How the deuce did you know I was out here?" he asked; "I thought the
steamer was only just about due."

"I saw you as we came into the harbor," Colin answered, "and I yelled
loud enough to be heard 'way back in Los Angeles, but you didn't pay any
attention."

"I thought I heard some one shouting a while back," his father said,
"but I was busy then and didn't have time to see who it was."

"How big is the tuna, do you think?"

"Not big enough to be listed. About eighty-five, I should say. What
about it, Vincente?"

"Little more," the boatman said; "I think perhaps ninety."

"Nothing of a record, you see, Colin," his father said, "just a good
morning's sport. But I want to hear all about your doings. It seems to
me that you're developing into quite a sensational person with your
fights with whales, and your sea-serpents, and all the rest of it.
You've been writing good letters, too, my boy. I'm glad to see that you
make use of your eyes when you're in strange places. Tell me how you got
to Astoria, I didn't quite follow that salmon business."

Colin started his yarn, but was only fairly launched into it when they
arrived at the wharf. There quite a crowd had gathered to welcome the
incoming boat, for a big tuna catch always arouses interest in Avalon,
and one of its features is the manner in which it is regarded as a
personal triumph for the angler. The promenaders gather to see the prize
weighed by the officials of the club, and it is rare that the customary
photograph of fish, angler, and gaffer is omitted. As for Colin, he was
as proud over the fish he had seen caught as though he had held the rod
himself.

"I had thought of going to the other side of the island for black
sea-bass to-morrow, Colin," his father said, "and I purposed going with
Colonel Roader. I suppose you would like to come instead, and from what
I hear I think I'll put off that trip and try tuna again to-morrow. You
want to come along?"

"I certainly should, Father," the boy said gratefully, "if it wouldn't
be spoiling your fun."

"Not a bit, my boy," was the kindly reply, "I've been looking forward to
teaching you something about real fishing. Beside which, I have an idea
that you and I will have enough to talk about to keep us going for a
good while. I'd like to take you up to the club-house now, but you'll
probably want to get back home, and we'll go along together. I can get
the boatman to look after notification at the club, and all that sort of
thing."

"I'll wait, if you like."

"No; Vincente knows all the ropes as well as I do. I judge from your
letters that you've enjoyed running around the way you have?"

"I wish you'd been along, Father," the boy replied. "I've had a bully
time. I never expected anything like it when I got aboard the _Gull_."

"I didn't either," said Major Dare dryly; "if I had thought of the
possibility of the ship being rammed by a whale, you'd never have put a
foot on her deck. But Captain Murchison said that whales were entirely
harmless, and so I let you go."

"But, Father, you should have seen the way the old whale charged"--and
the lad plunged into the thick of the story. He was fairly out of
breath when they reached the little cottage Major Dare had rented for a
couple of months, but the boy was by no means out of material, and
nothing short of an absolute command could keep him silent long enough
to eat his lunch. In the afternoon he unpacked his trunk, revealing
little quaint articles he had picked up on his travels as gifts for the
various members of the family. But the excitement of home-coming had
tired the boy, and quite early in the evening he found himself getting
sleepy, so that not long after his little sister had been snugly tucked
up, Colin announced his readiness to go to bed, on the ground that he
was to get up early the next day, as he was going tuna-fishing.

The morning broke hot and hazy. The gray-green of the foliage on the
mountains had a purple tinge in the early morning light, and the sea
took on a mother-of-pearl gleam behind its amethyst, as it reflected the
changing hues of the roseate sunrise. Over San Antonio and San Jacinto
the sun rose gloriously, and in the freshness of the morning air the
giant flying-fish of the Pacific leaped and gleamed across the
mirror-smooth sea.

Colin drew a long breath and expanded his lungs to the full, as though
he could breathe in the glow of color and the wonder of it all.

"It always feels good to be alive at this hour of the morning!" he said.

His father smiled appreciatively.

"You're generally asleep," he said. "But it's a good thing we did get up
in time to-day, for unless my eyes are failing me, I think I can see in
the distance the tunas coming in. Say, Vincente, doesn't that look like
them over there?"

"Yes, sair, I t'ink dat's a school. I overheard a man on ze pier telling
of a beeg one he caught yesterday," said the boatman.

"That was Mr. Retaner," was the answer, "one of the most famous anglers
and authorities on fishing in America. That's why I came out this
morning; he said he thought the school would arrive soon, and what
Retaner doesn't know about fishing isn't worth knowing. He practically
created deep-sea angling in America, so that as an industry it is worth
millions of dollars annually to the country, and as a sport it has been
put in the first rank."

Across the sea of glass with its rose reflections of the sunrise and the
deep underglow of richly-colored life beneath the transparent water,
there came a quick shiver of ripples. Then half a mile away, but
advancing rapidly, appeared a strange turmoil, and in the sunlight, a
stretch of sea, acres in extent, was churned into white foam, looking
like some fairy ice- or snow-field. Above this, at a height of about ten
feet, glittered a palpitating silver canopy, almost blinding in its
sparkle and its sheen.

"What is that?" asked Colin, wondering.

"The tuna feeding and coming down the coast," was the reply.

As it drew nearer, Colin saw that the gleaming silver canopy was formed
of thousands upon thousands of flying-fish, skimming through the air,
dropping to the water every fifty yards or so, then, with a single twist
of the screw-like tail, rising in the air for another soaring flight.

Below, from the surface of the water broken to foam by the tumult, would
leap those tremendous jumpers of the sea, the tuna, plunging through the
living cloud of flying-fish, and dropping to feed upon those which fell
stunned under their impetuous charges. Occasionally, but very rarely, a
tuna would seize its fish in midair, and it was marvelous to see a fish
nearly as large as a man spring like a bolt from a cross-bow out of the
sea, often until it was ten feet above the water, then turn and plunge
back into the ocean.

"We'd better get out of here, I think," Major Dare said to the boatman;
"this is getting to be too much of a good thing."

But, as he said the word, the school of flying-fish swerved right in the
direction of the boat, and in a minute the anglers were surrounded. The
silent, skimming flight of the long-finned flying-fish, the boiling of
the sea, lashed to fury by the pursuing tuna, and these living
projectiles, hurled as a silvered bolt into the air, frightened Colin
not a little, although he was enjoying the experience thoroughly.

"Look out you don't get struck by a flying-fish," his father called to
him, bending low in his seat. Colin, who had not thought of this
possibility, followed suit rapidly, because the California flying-fish,
unlike his Atlantic cousin, is a fish sometimes eighteen inches long,
and he saw that if he were struck by one in the full speed of its
skimming flight, he might easily be knocked overboard.

"Can't they see where they are going?" asked the boy.

"They can see well enough," his father answered, "but they have little
or no control over their flight. "On making the experiment related
by Otto von Guericke," he says, "which consists in making a ball of
sulphur rendered electrical to repel a down feather, I perceived that the
same effects were produced not only by the tube, but by all electric
bodies whatsoever, and I discovered that which accounts for a great
part of the irregularities and, if I may use the term, of the
caprices that seem to accompany most of the experiments on
electricity.

This principle is that electric bodies attract all that are not so, and
repel them as soon as they are become electric by the vicinity or
contact of the electric body.

Thus gold-leaf is first attracted by the tube, and acquires an
electricity by approaching it, and of consequence is immediately repelled
by it. Nor is it reattracted while it retains its electric quality. But
if while it is thus sustained in the air it chance to light on some other
body, it straightway loses its electricity, and in consequence is
reattracted by the tube, which, after having given it a new electricity,
repels it a second time, which continues as long as the tube keeps
its electricity. Upon applying this principle to the various experiments
of electricity, one will be surprised at the number of obscure and
puzzling facts that it clears up. For Mr.

Hauksbee's famous experiment of the glass globe, in which silk
threads are put, is a necessary consequence of it.

When these threads are arranged in the form of rays by the electricity
of the sides of the globe, if the finger be put near the outside
of the globe the silk threads within fly from it, as is well known,
which happens only because the finger or any other body applied
near the glass globe is thereby rendered electrical, and consequently
repels the silk threads which are endowed with the same quality.

With a little reflection we may in the same manner account for most of
the other phenomena, and which seem inexplicable without attending
to this principle.

"Chance has thrown in my way another principle, more universal and
remarkable than the preceding one, and which throws a new light on
the subject of electricity.

This principle is that there are two distinct electricities, very different
from each other, one of which I call vitreous electricity and the
other resinous electricity.

The first is that of glass, rock-crystal, precious stones, hair of
animals, wool, and many other bodies. The second is that of amber, copal,
gumsack, silk thread, paper, and a number of other substances. The
characteristic of these two electricities is that a body of the
vitreous electricity, for example, repels all such as are of the same
electricity, and on the contrary attracts all those of the resinous
electricity; so that the tube, made electrical, will repel glass,
crystal, hair of animals, etc., when rendered electric, and will
attract silk thread, paper, etc., though rendered electrical likewise.

Amber, on the contrary, will attract electric glass and other
substances of the same class, and will repel gum-sack, copal, silk
thread, etc.

Two silk ribbons rendered electrical will repel each other; two
woollen threads will do the like; but a woollen thread and a silken
thread will mutually attract each other. This principle very naturally
explains why the ends of threads of silk or wool recede from each
other, in the form of pencil or broom, when they have acquired an
electric quality.

From this principle one may with the same ease deduce the explanation
of a great number of other phenomena; and it is probable that this
truth will lead us to the further discovery of many other things.

"In order to know immediately to which of the two classes of electrics
belongs any body whatsoever, one need only render electric a silk
thread, which is known to be of the resinuous electricity, and see
whether that body, rendered electrical, attracts or repels it.

If it attracts it, it is certainly of the kind of electricity which
I call VITREOUS; if, on the contrary, it repels it, it is of the
same kind of electricity with the silk--that is, of the RESINOUS.

I have likewise observed that communicated electricity retains the
same properties; for if a ball of ivory or wood be set on a glass
stand, and this ball be rendered electric by the tube, it will repel
such substances as the tube repels; but if it be rendered electric
by applying a cylinder of gum-sack near it, it will produce quite
contrary effects--namely, precisely the same as gum-sack would
produce.

In order to succeed in these experiments, it is requisite that the
two bodies which are put near each other, to find out the nature
of their electricity, be rendered as electrical as possible, for
if one of them was not at all or but weakly electrical, it would
be attracted by the other, though it be of that sort that should
naturally be repelled by it.

But the experiment will always succeed perfectly well if both bodies
are sufficiently electrical

."[1]
As we now know, Dufay was wrong in supposing that there were two different
kinds of electricity, vitreous and resinous. A little later the matter
was explained by calling one "positive" electricity and the other "negative,"
and it was believed that certain substances produced only the one kind
peculiar to that particular substance.

We shall see presently, however, that some twenty years later
an English scientist dispelled this illusion by producing both
positive (or vitreous) and negative (or resinous) electricity on
the same tube of glass at the same time.

After the death of Dufay his work was continued by his fellow-countryman
Dr. Joseph Desaguliers, who was the first experimenter to electrify
running water, and who was probably the first to suggest that clouds
might be electrified bodies. But about, this time--that is, just
before the middle of the eighteenth century--the field of greatest
experimental activity was transferred to Germany, although both England
and France were still active. The two German philosophers who accomplished
most at this time were Christian August Hansen and George Matthias
Bose, both professors in Leipsic.

Both seem to have conceived the idea, simultaneously and independently,
of generating electricity by revolving globes run by belt and wheel
in much the same manner as the apparatus of Hauksbee.

With such machines it was possible to generate a much greater amount of
electricity than Dufay had been able to do with the rubbed tube, and so
equipped, the two German professors were able to generate electric sparks
and jets of fire in a most startling manner. Bose in particular had a
love for the spectacular, which he turned to account with his new
electrical machine upon many occasions.

On one of these occasions he prepared an elaborate dinner, to which a large
number of distinguished guests were invited.

Before the arrival of the company, however, Bose insulated the
great banquet-table on cakes of pitch, and then connected it with a huge
electrical machine concealed in another room. All being ready, and
the guests in their places about to be seated, Bose gave a secret
signal for starting this machine, when, to the astonishment of the
party, flames of fire shot from flowers, dishes, and viands, giving
a most startling but beautiful display.

To add still further to the astonishment of his guests, Bose then
presented a beautiful young lady, to whom each of the young men
of the party was introduced.

In some mysterious manner she was insulated and connected with the
concealed electrical machine, so that as each gallant touched her fingertips
he received an electric shock that "made him reel."

Not content with this, the host invited the young men to kiss the beautiful
maid. But those who were bold enough to attempt it received an
electric shock that nearly "knocked their teeth out," as the professor
tells it.

LUDOLFF'S EXPERIMENT WITH THE ELECTRIC SPARK
But Bose was only one of several German scientists who were making
elaborate experiments.

While Bose was constructing and experimenting with his huge machine, another
German, Christian Friedrich Ludolff, demonstrated that electric
sparks are actual fire--a fact long suspected but hitherto unproved.

Ludolff's discovery, as it chanced, was made in the lecture-hall of the
reorganized Academy of Sciences at Berlin, before an audience of
scientists and great personages, at the opening lecture in 1744.

In the course of this lecture on electricity, during which some of
the well-known manifestations of electricity were being shown, it
occurred to Ludolff to attempt to ignite some inflammable fluid by
projecting an electric spark upon its surface with a glass rod. This
idea was suggested to him while performing the familiar experiment
of producing a spark on the surface of a bowl of water by touching it
with a charged glass rod.

He announced to his audience the experiment he was about to attempt, and
having warmed a spoonful of sulphuric ether, he touched its surface with
the glass rod, causing it to burst into flame.

This experiment left no room for doubt that the electric spark was
actual fire.

As soon as this experiment of Ludolff's was made known to Bose, he
immediately claimed that he had previously made similar demonstrations
on various inflammable substances, both liquid and solid; and it
seems highly probable that he had done so, as he was constantly
experimenting with the sparks, and must almost certainly have set
certain substances ablaze by accident, if not by intent.

At all events, he carried on a series of experiments along this line
to good purpose, finally succeeding in exploding gun-powder, and so making
the first forerunner of the electric fuses now so universally used
in blasting, firing cannon, and other similar purposes. It was Bose
also who, observing some of the peculiar manifestations in electrified
tubes, and noticing their resemblance to "northern lights," was one
of the first, if not the first, to suggest that the aurora borealis is
of electric origin.

These spectacular demonstrations had the effect of calling public attention
to the fact that electricity is a most wonderful and mysterious thing,
to say the least, and kept both scientists and laymen agog with expectancy.
Bose himself was aflame with excitement, and so determined in his efforts
to produce still stronger electric currents, that he sacrificed the
tube of his twenty-foot telescope for the construction of a mammoth
electrical machine. With this great machine a discharge of electricity
was generated powerful enough to wound the skin when it happened to
strike it.

Until this time electricity had been little more than a plaything
of the scientists--or, at least, no practical use had been made
of it.

As it was a practising physician, Gilbert, who first laid the
foundation for experimenting with the new substance, so again it
was a medical man who first attempted to put it to practical use,
and that in the field of his profession.

Gottlieb Kruger, a professor of medicine at Halle in 1743, suggested
that electricity might be of use in some branches of medicine; and the
year following Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein made a first experiment
to determine the effects of electricity upon the body.
He found that "the action of the heart was accelerated, the circulation
increased, and that muscles were made to contract by the discharge":
and he began at once administering electricity in the treatment of
certain diseases.

He found that it acted beneficially in rheumatic affections, and that
it was particularly useful in certain nervous diseases, such as palsies.

This was over a century ago, and to-day about the most important use made
of the particular kind of electricity with which he experimented (the
static, or frictional) is for the treatment of diseases affecting
the nervous system.

By the middle of the century a perfect mania for making electrical machines
had spread over Europe, and the whirling, hand-rubbed globes were
gradually replaced by great cylinders rubbed by woollen cloths or
pads, and generating an "enormous power of electricity." These cylinders
were run by belts and foot-treadles, and gave a more powerful,
constant, and satisfactory current than known heretofore. While making
experiments with one of these machines, Johann Heinrichs Winkler
attempted to measure the speed at which electricity travels. To do this
he extended a cord suspended on silk threads, with the end attached to
the machine and the end which was to attract the bits of gold-leaf
near enough together so that the operator could watch and measure
the interval of time that elapsed between the starting of the current
along the cord and its attracting the gold-leaf.

The length of the cord used in this experiment was only a little
over a hundred feet, and this was, of course, entirely inadequate,
the current travelling that space apparently instantaneously.

The improved method of generating electricity that had come into general
use made several of the scientists again turn their attention more
particularly to attempt putting it to some practical account. They were
stimulated to these efforts by the constant reproaches that were beginning
to be heard on all sides that electricity was merely a "philosopher's
plaything."

One of the first to succeed in inventing something that approached a
practical mechanical contrivance was Andrew Gordon, a Scotch Benedictine
monk. He invented an electric bell which would ring automatically,
and a little "motor," if it may be so called. And while neither of these
inventions were of any practical importance in themselves, they were
attempts in the right direction, and were the first ancestors of
modern electric bells and motors, although the principle upon which
they worked was entirely different from modern electrical machines.

The motor was simply a wheel with several protruding metal points around
its rim. These points were arranged to receive an electrical
discharge from a frictional machine, the discharge causing the
wheel to rotate.

There was very little force given to this rotation, however, not
enough, in fact, to make it possible to more than barely turn the
wheel itself. Two more great discoveries, galvanism and electro-magnetic
induction, were necessary before the practical motor became possible.

The sober Gordon had a taste for the spectacular almost equal to that of
Bose.

It was he who ignited a bowl of alcohol by turning a stream of electrified
water upon it, thus presenting the seeming paradox of fire produced by
a stream of water. Gordon also demonstrated the power of the electrical
discharge by killing small birds and animals at a distance of two hundred
ells, the electricity being conveyed that distance through small wires.

THE LEYDEN JAR DISCOVERED
As yet no one had discovered that electricity could be stored, or generated
in any way other than by some friction device. But very soon two
experimenters, Dean von Kleist, of Camin, Pomerania, and Pieter van
Musschenbroek, the famous teacher of Leyden, apparently independently,
made the discovery of what has been known ever since as the Leyden
jar.

And although Musschenbroek is sometimes credited with being the discoverer,
there can be no doubt that Von Kleist's discovery antedated his
by a few months at least.

Von Kleist found that by a device made of a narrow-necked bottle containing
alcohol or mercury, into which an iron nail was inserted, be was able
to retain the charge of electricity, after electrifying this
apparatus with the frictional machine.

He made also a similar device, more closely resembling the modern Leyden
jar, from a thermometer tube partly filled with water and a wire
tipped with a ball of lead.

With these devices he found that he could retain the charge of
electricity for several hours, and could produce the usual electrical
manifestations, even to igniting spirits, quite as well as with the
frictional machine.

These experiments were first made in October, 1745, and after a month of
further experimenting, Von Kleist sent the following account of them
to several of the leading scientists, among others, Dr.

Lieberkuhn, in Berlin, and Dr. Kruger, of Halle.

"When a nail, or a piece of thick brass wire, is put into a small
apothecary's phial and electrified, remarkable effects follow; but
the phial must be very dry, or warm.

I commonly rub it over beforehand with a finger on which I put some
pounded chalk.

If a little mercury or a few drops of spirit of wine be put into it, the
experiment succeeds better. As soon as this phial and nail are removed
from the electrifying-glass, or the prime conductor, to which it has been
exposed, is taken away, it throws out a pencil of flame so long that,
with this burning machine in my hand, I have taken above sixty
steps in walking about my room.

When it is electrified strongly, I can take it into another room and there
fire spirits of wine with it.

If while it is electrifying I put my finger, or a piece of gold
which I hold in my hand, to the nail, I receive a shock which stuns
my arms and shoulders.

"A tin tube, or a man, placed upon electrics, is electrified much stronger
by this means than in the common way. When I present this phial and nail
to a tin tube, which I have, fifteen feet long, nothing but
experience can make a person believe how strongly it is electrified.

I am persuaded," he adds, "that in this manner Mr. Bose would not have
taken a second electrical kiss. Two thin glasses have been broken by the
shock of it.

It appears to me very extraordinary, that when this phial and nail are
in contact with either conducting or non-conducting matter, the
strong shock does not follow.

I have cemented it to wood, metal, glass, sealing-wax, etc., when I have
electrified without any great effect.

The human body, therefore, must contribute something to it.

This opinion is confirmed by my observing that unless I hold the phial
in my hand I cannot fire spirits of wine with it

."[2]
But it seems that none of the men who saw this account were able to repeat
the experiment and produce the effects claimed by Von Kleist, and
probably for this reason the discovery of the obscure Pomeranian was for
a time lost sight of.

Musschenbroek's discovery was made within a short time after Von
Kleist's--in fact, only a matter of about two months later.

But the difference in the reputations of the two discoverers insured
a very different reception for their discoveries.

Musschenbroek was one of the foremost teachers of Europe, and so
widely known that the great universities vied with each other, and
kings were bidding, for his services.

Naturally, any discovery made by such a famous person would soon be
heralded from one end of Europe to the other. And so when this professor
of Leyden made his discovery, the apparatus came to be called the "Leyden
jar," for want of a better name. There can be little doubt that Musschenbroek
made his discovery entirely independently of any knowledge of Von
Kleist's, or, for that matter, without ever having heard of the Pomeranian,
and his actions in the matter are entirely honorable.

His discovery was the result of an accident. While experimenting to determine
the strength of electricity he suspended a gun-barrel, which he charged
with electricity from a revolving glass globe. From the end of the
gun-barrel opposite the globe was a brass wire, which extended into a
glass jar partly filled with water. Musschenbroek held in one hand
this jar, while with the other he attempted to draw sparks from the
barrel. Suddenly he received a shock in the hand holding the jar, that
"shook him like a stroke of lightning," and for a moment made him
believe that "he was done for." Continuing his experiments, nevertheless,
he found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on the
table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with
one hand and touching the wire with the other--that is, a path was made
for the electrical discharge through the body. This was practically
the same experiment as made by Von Kleist with his bottle and nail,
but carried one step farther, as it showed that the "jar" need not
necessarily be held in the hand, as believed by Von Kleist.

Further experiments, continued by many philosophers at the time, revealed
what Von Kleist had already pointed out, that the electrified jar
remained charged for some time.

Soon after this Daniel Gralath, wishing to obtain stronger discharges
than could be had from a single Leyden jar, conceived the idea of
combining several jars, thus for the first time grouping the
generators in a "battery" which produced a discharge strong enough
to kill birds and small animals.

He also attempted to measure the strength of the discharges, but soon
gave it up in despair, and the solution of this problem was left
for late nineteenth-century scientists.

The advent of the Leyden jar, which made it possible to produce strong
electrical discharges from a small and comparatively simple device,
was followed by more spectacular demonstrations of various kinds all
over Europe.

These exhibitions aroused the interest of the kings and noblemen, so
that electricity no longer remained a "plaything of the philosophers"
alone, but of kings as well.

A favorite demonstration was that of sending the electrical discharge
through long lines of soldiers linked together by pieces of wire, the
discharge causing them to "spring into the air simultaneously" in
a most astonishing manner.

A certain monk in Paris prepared a most elaborate series of demonstrations
for the amusement of the king, among other things linking together
an entire regiment of nine hundred men, causing them to perform
simultaneous springs and contortions in a manner most amusing to
the royal guests.

But not all the experiments being made were of a purely spectacular
character, although most of them accomplished little except in a
negative way.

The famous Abbe Nollet, for example, combined useful experiments
with spectacular demonstrations, thus keeping up popular interest
while aiding the cause of scientific electricity.

WILLIAM WATSON
Naturally, the new discoveries made necessary a new nomenclature, new
words and electrical terms being constantly employed by the various
writers of that day.

Among these writers was the English scientist William Watson, who was
not only a most prolific writer but a tireless investigator. Many of the
words coined by him are now obsolete, but one at least, "circuit,"
still remains in use.

In 1746, a French scientist, Louis Guillaume le Monnier, bad made a
circuit including metal and water by laying a chain half-way around
the edge of a pond, a man at either end holding it.

He had been bending over as he hauled up the rope and the
squid's tentacles around his arms held him poised half out of the boat,
his head not more than a foot and a half from the surface of the water,
looking straight into the hypnotic, black, unwinking eyes of the
sea-monster.

The instinct of fright arose. Using all his strength, he raised his
right arm and grasped the tentacle that had been wound around his left
arm. To his surprise he found that a moderate amount of force only was
needed to pull the grasp of the tentacle free, and he released himself
from the creature almost without difficulty. Nor, except for a slightly
reddened spot on his arms, was there any outward evidence of the
encounter.

Vincente reached down for the cephalopod, allowing it to wrap some of
the tentacles about him, then pried its grasp from the boat with the
handle of the gaff. He made no attempt to free himself from the squid,
but as he stood still for a minute or two, the creature voluntarily
released its hold, falling to the bottom of the boat.

"Zey haven't any strengt' at all out of ze water," the boatman said,
"but while swimming zey have a good deal. See, ze whole body of zat
squid isn't more zan two feet long, an' yet if he'd got a hold of you in
ze water, specially with ze bigger suckers on ze t'ick part of ze arms,
you might have had some trouble. Zose big fellows wit' bodies twenty
feet long an' arms t'irty feet, mus' be one horrible t'ing to meet on a
dark night."

"But would they attack you?"

"Never, I t'ink," said the boatman. "Ze biggest of zem hasn't a beak
large enough to take in a herring."

"Well," Colin said, "I suppose that really wasn't as exciting as it
seemed, but I tell you, for a while, I felt as if I was having all the
thrill I wanted."

"You ought to try ze octopus, now," said the boatman with a chuckle;
"zat is, if you've had enough of ze squids. It's early yet an' we might
go after some of zose octopuses zat hunt crabs."

"I'm ready," said Colin. "They won't get me by surprise, like that squid
did!"

The sun was near the horizon when Colin and the boatman landed on the
rocky shore, and the sunset colors were gorgeous. But Colin did not want
to run any chances of being caught napping, and he followed Vincente,
watching every move. Presently the boatman stopped and pointed, like a
dog flushing a covey of partridges.

About eight feet away was a crab of fair size, perhaps six inches across
the shell. Half-way between where they stood and the crab, right on the
edge of the water, was a small octopus with its large, glaring, green
eyes fixed on the crab. This was at first the only sight Colin could get
of the creature, but by looking into the water closely, he was able to
make out the vague shape of the octopus. The cuttlefish had changed from
its natural color to the exact hue of the sandy bottom on which it was
crawling, and it was advancing so slowly that its progress could hardly
be seen.

[Illustration: OCTOPUS CAUGHT AT SANTA CATALINA, TWENTY-TWO FEET ACROSS.

_By permission of Mr. Chas. Fredk. Holder._]

[Illustration: SQUID CAUGHT AT SANTA CATALINA, 20 FEET IN LENGTH.

(In Newfoundland a species reaches 70 feet.)

_By permission of Mr. Chas. Fredk. Holder._]

Suddenly, as a wave washed it within a few feet of the crab, two of the
tentacles darted out so swiftly that Colin could scarcely follow the
move until they were upon the crab, the rest of the body of the octopus
flattening itself upon the sand as though to secure a greater purchase.
The crab set both its claws into the soft flesh of the tentacles,
whereupon, with a series of horrible convulsions, the cuttlefish
lumbered entirely out of the sea and, with two or three repulsive and
sinuous gyrations, it forced itself bodily over the crab. By this means
the outstretched membranes at the base of the tentacles smothered the
movements of the prey and prevented escape, while at the same time the
mouth and biting beaks were brought into position where they could find
a vital part.

"Do you want zat one as a specimen?" asked the boatman.

Colin was conscious inwardly that he would have preferred to have
nothing at all to do with the repulsive object, but as he had come out
in pursuit of an octopus, he would not, for the world, have shown the
white feather before the boatman.

"Yes, unless we find a bigger," he said, with an overdone assumption of
ease.

"I t'ink, sair," Vincente responded, "zat we'd better be satisfied wit'
zis one. Shall I take it or will you?"

There was just a hint of irony in the boatman's tone, and remembering
the timidity he had shown when clutched by the squid, Colin felt that
this was the chance to redeem himself.

"I don't mind taking it," he said. "You say these things are quite
harmless."

"Quite, sair, I t'ink," the boatman replied.

"All right," was the boy's rejoinder, and he walked forward boldly
toward the octopus. The green eyes regarded him steadily, and just as
the boy stooped to grasp the slimy body, it seemed to gather itself in a
heap and started for the sea.

This was an unexpected move, but Colin, having stated that he wanted
that octopus, did not propose to be cheated out of it. He was surprised
that the cuttlefish could move so fast, and his repugnance gave way to
excitement as he started running after the writhing eight-armed
creature. He was just about to grab it when he tripped on a rock,
covered with slippery seaweed, and fell headlong, the fall throwing him
immediately upon the octopus. For a moment the boy was staggered, and
he never knew whether he had grabbed the cephalopod or whether it had
grasped him, all he knew was that he was lying on the ground with six of
the eight arms of the octopus around him.

The boy was just in time to throw up his hands to protect his eyes, as a
torrent of the inky fluid deluged him from head to foot. He struggled to
get up, but the two tentacles of the cuttlefish held fast to adjacent
rocks, and Colin might have found difficulty in freeing himself, owing
to the awkward attitude in which he had been caught, but for Vincente,
who wrenched the tentacles away from their hold.

"Are you all right, sair?" the boatman asked.

"All right," said Colin stoutly, as he got up.

Seldom had he been such a sight! He was black from head to foot with the
sepia fluid, his clothes were torn where he had fallen on the rocks, and
he was smothered in the nauseous embrace of the uncanny and diabolical
eight-armed creature clinging to his shoulder. Once, on the way to the
boat, the cuttlefish seemed ready to drop off, but, at Vincente's
warning, Colin made believe to force apart the other tentacles, and the
octopus renewed its hold. As soon as they reached the boat and the boy
stood still a moment, the cuttlefish let go, and fell to the bottom of
the boat.

Colin looked down at himself and laughed, then jumped overboard in all
his clothes, threshing around in the water to remove as much of the
sepia as he could, clambering in when he had washed off the worst of it.

Vincente looked at him.

"I t'ink, sair," he said, smiling, "you ought to be photograph' wit' ze
catch!"


CHAPTER VI

DEFEATED BY A SPOTTED MORAY


Colin's brilliant success at Santa Catalina, signalized by his receipt
of the tuna button, had so increased Major Dare's pride in him that when
the boy renewed his request that he be allowed to enter the Bureau of
Fisheries, his appeal received attention. The inspiration that he had
gained from the whole-hearted enthusiasm of the professor was evident in
all that the boy said, and his father was surprised to find how much the
lad really had learned about the work of the Government during his
experiences in the Behring Sea and on the Columbia River.

"It doesn't appeal to me particularly," his father said quietly, when
the boy closed a somewhat impassioned petition, "but we are each built
upon a different pattern. To me, fish are of interest as a food and for
sport. I couldn't be satisfied to take them up as a lifework. There's no
money in it; of course, you can see that."

"There isn't in any government work, is there?"

"No," was the reply, "big fortunes are always made in individual ways.
But when you're starting out in life, it is much more important to be
able to do the work you like than it is to seek only for money. The
principal thing I'm afraid of is that you will find it tiresome and
monotonous after a while. It's very hard work with a good deal of manual
labor involved, and there is nothing particularly attractive in a bushel
of fish-eggs!"

"But it's only on the start that you have to do the steady grind," Colin
objected, "and one has to do that in every line of work. I know you
would very much rather I took to farming or lumbering, but I think a
fish is a much more interesting thing to work with than a hill of corn
or a jack-pine."

"But don't you think you would find it tame after a while?"

Colin leaned forward eagerly.

"I know I wouldn't," he said confidently. "I've heard you say, Father,
that everything was interesting if you only went into it deeply enough.
Now, there's more chance for real original work with fish than in any
other line I've ever heard of. The professor gave me an idea of all the
different problems the Bureau was trying to solve, and each of them was
more interesting than the last. You've got to be a doctor to study fish
diseases, an engineer to devise ways and means for stream conditions, a
chemist to work on poisons in the water that comes from factories, and
all sorts of other things beside. It looks to me as though it had the
best of all the professions boiled down into one!"

"That's an exaggerated statement, of course," was the reply; "but you
seem in earnest. No," he continued, as Colin prepared to burst forth
again, "you've said enough."

The boy waited anxiously, for he felt that the answer would decide his
career.

"If your heart is set on the Fisheries," his father rejoined
thoughtfully, after a few minutes' reflection, "I presume it would be
unwise to stop you. But remember what I have told you before--I'm
perfectly willing to fit you for any profession in life you want to take
up, but only for one. If you begin on anything you have got to go
through with it. I'll have no quitting. As you know, I would rather you
had taken up lumbering, but I don't want to force you into anything, and
perhaps your brother Roderick may like the woods. You're sure, however,
as to what you want?"

"I want fishes!" said Colin firmly.

"I've been looking up the question a little since you wrote to me from
Valdez," Major Dare continued, "because I saw that your old desires had
increased instead of dying out. You know, Colin, I want to help you as
much as I can. You realize that there's no school of fisheries, like the
forestry schools, don't you?"

"Yes, Father."

"And that if you go into the Bureau the only way you can learn is by the
actual work, hard work and dirty work, too, it will be often."

"Yes, sir," the boy answered, "I was told that, too."

"I wrote to the Commissioner," said Major Dare, "and explained the whole
position to him. He answered my letter in a most friendly way, and
showed me just what I've been telling you this morning. He pointed out
frankly that the Bureau had so much to do and so little money
appropriated to do it on, that such a thing as a 'soft job' wasn't known
in the service."

"I'm not looking for that," said Colin, a trifle indignantly.

"I don't think you are, my boy, but you want to be sure before you take
the plunge," was the warning answer. "You oughtn't to wait until you are
in college before you make up your mind."

Colin looked across the table at his father and met his glance squarely.

"There's nothing else that I want to do," he said firmly, "and I do want
that. Of course, I'll do whatever you say, but I feel that the Bureau of
Fisheries is where I'm bound to land in the end."

"No going back?"

"No going back, Father!"

Major Dare reached out his hand, and the boy grasped it warmly.

"Very well, my boy, that's a compact. I'm not sure just what will need
to be done to enter you in the Bureau, but whatever is necessary, we'll
do. I think you have decided on a life that will be hard and sometimes
thankless, but at least it is a man's job, and will have its own
compensations. You couldn't possibly do anything more useful. We'll go
home by way of Washington, visit the Fisheries Bureau together, and see
what arrangements we can make."

"That's bully, Father," said Colin earnestly; "thank you ever so much."

"Make good, my boy," his father answered, "that's all you have to do.
You'll only have yourself to thank, for it will be all your own fight."

It was fortunate for Colin that this was not decided until the day
before they left Santa Catalina, for he became so impatient that the
intervening hours before they started for the East seemed like weeks to
the boy. His enthusiasm was so genuine that, although his mother was
already very tired of the interminable 'angling' conversation in Santa
Catalina, she succeeded nobly in evincing an intense interest in the
whole fish tribe.

When they arrived in Washington, which chanced to be in the afternoon,
Colin wanted to start off for the Bureau of Fisheries immediately, even
before he went to the hotel, and he seemed to feel quite aggrieved when
the visit was put off. Major Dare had some important business to look
after and he purposed to leave the question of the boy's arrangements
open for a couple of days, but he saw there would be no peace for any
one until Colin's fate was settled, and at the boy's importunity he
'phoned to the Bureau and made an appointment with the Commissioner for
the following day.

Next morning, accordingly, the two started off together for the
Fisheries Building, an antiquated structure standing in the magnificent
park behind the National Museum and but a short distance from the
Smithsonian Institution. They entered on the ground-floor, seeing to the
left a number of hatching troughs, to the right models of nets and
fishing-vessels, at the far end a small aquarium, while in the center
was a tank in which were the two fur seals that the boy had heard about
in the Pribilof Islands.

He pulled his father's arm.

"Oh, Father!" he cried; "there are the fur seals. Come over and see
them!"

But his father shook his head smilingly.

"They are not personal friends of mine, as they seem to be of yours," he
said, "and I have no time to waste. Besides, we have an engagement with
the Commissioner. You can come down and chat with your seal
acquaintances after our talk."

The Commissioner greeted them cordially, and without waste of words.

"So this is the boy!" he said, after the customary greetings. "He'll
need to grow a bit, eh?"

"So did both of us once," said Major Dare, looking at his own height
and the Commissioner's burly frame. "We haven't done so badly."

"That's true. Well, boy, tell me just what you want to do."

"Everything that there is to do in the Bureau, Mr. Glades," answered
Colin promptly.

The Commissioner rubbed his hand over his chin, with a short laugh.

"That's a big order," he said. "Willing to work?"

"Yes, sir," the boy replied; "I don't mind work."

"This is the place for it. There's just two kinds of people in the
world," the Commissioner went on; "those who do just what they learn to
do and nothing else, and those who do the work because they want to."

"Yes, sir," again responded the boy, wondering what was coming.

"The first lot keep things running and that's all. The others are the
real men. The last are the men we've got in the Bureau and everybody has
to be up to the standard. So, there you are."

"I don't know whether I can come up to the standard, but I'm one of
those that want to!" the boy said emphatically, rightly judging that
the Commissioner was not the sort of man who liked long speeches.

"Good! Going to college?"

The boy looked at his father.

"I had thought of sending him to Brown," he said, "since he got this
Fisheries idea. One of my friends told me that it was an excellent
university for biology."

"Do it!" said the Commissioner. "The mean distance of the moon from the
earth, in the syzygies in semi-diameters of the earth, is, according
to Ptolemy and most astronomers, 59; according to Vendelin and
Huygens, 60; to Copernicus, 60 1/3; to Street, 60 2/3; and to
Tycho, 56 1/2.

But Tycho, and all that follow his tables of refractions, making the
refractions of the sun and moon (altogether against the nature of
light) to exceed the refractions of the fixed stars, and that by
four or five minutes NEAR THE HORIZON, did thereby increase the
moon's HORIZONTAL parallax by a like number of minutes, that is,
by a twelfth or fifteenth part of the whole parallax.

Correct this error and the distance will become about 60 1/2 semi-diameters
of the earth, near to what others have assigned.
Let us assume the mean distance of 60 diameters in the syzygies; and
suppose one revolution of the moon, in respect to the fixed stars, to
be completed in 27d. 7h. 43', as astronomers have determined; and
the circumference of the earth to amount to 123,249,600 Paris feet,
as the French have found by mensuration.

And now, if we imagine the moon, deprived of all motion, to be let
go, so as to descend towards the earth with the impulse of all that
force by which (by Cor.

Prop. iii.) it is retained in its orb, it will in the space of one
minute of time describe in its fall 15 1/12 Paris feet.

For the versed sine of that arc which the moon, in the space of one
minute of time, would by its mean motion describe at the distance
of sixty semi-diameters of the earth, is nearly 15 1/12 Paris feet,
or more accurately 15 feet, 1 inch, 1 line 4/9.

Wherefore, since that force, in approaching the earth, increases
in the reciprocal-duplicate proportion of the distance, and upon
that account, at the surface of the earth, is 60 x 60 times greater
than at the moon, a body in our regions, falling with that force,
ought in the space of one minute of time to describe 60 x 60 x 15
1/12 Paris feet; and in the space of one second of time, to describe
15 1/12 of those feet, or more accurately, 15 feet, 1 inch, 1 line
4/9.

And with this very force we actually find that bodies here upon earth do
really descend; for a pendulum oscillating seconds in the latitude of
Paris will be 3 Paris feet, and 8 lines 1/2 in length, as Mr. Huygens
has observed. And the space which a heavy body describes by falling
in one second of time is to half the length of the pendulum in the
duplicate ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
(as Mr.

Huygens has also shown), and is therefore 15 Paris feet, 1 inch, 1
line 4/9.

And therefore the force by which the moon is retained in its
orbit is that very same force which we commonly call gravity; for,
were gravity another force different from that, then bodies descending
to the earth with the joint impulse of both forces would fall with
a double velocity, and in the space of one second of time would
describe 30 1/6 Paris feet; altogether against experience

."[1]
All this is beautifully clear, and its validity has never in recent
generations been called in question; yet it should be explained
that the argument does not amount to an actually indisputable
demonstration.

It is at least possible that the coincidence between the observed and
computed motion of the moon may be a mere coincidence and nothing more.
This probability, however, is so remote that Newton is fully
justified in disregarding it, and, as has been said, all subsequent
generations have accepted the computation as demonstrative.

Let us produce now Newton's further computations as to the other planetary
bodies, passing on to his final conclusion that gravity is a
universal force.

"PROPOSITION V., THEOREM V.

"That the circumjovial planets gravitate towards Jupiter; the
circumsaturnal towards Saturn; the circumsolar towards the sun; and
by the forces of their gravity are drawn off from rectilinear
motions, and retained in curvilinear orbits.

"For the revolutions of the circumjovial planets about Jupiter, of the
circumsaturnal about Saturn, and of Mercury and Venus and the other
circumsolar planets about the sun, are appearances of the same sort
with the revolution of the moon about the earth; and therefore, by
Rule ii., must be owing to the same sort of causes; especially since
it has been demonstrated that the forces upon which those revolutions
depend tend to the centres of Jupiter, of Saturn, and of the sun;
and that those forces, in receding from Jupiter, from Saturn, and
from the sun, decrease in the same proportion, and according to the
same law, as the force of gravity does in receding from the earth.

"COR. 1.

--There is, therefore, a power of gravity tending to all the planets;
for doubtless Venus, Mercury, and the rest are bodies of the same sort
with Jupiter and Saturn.

And since all attraction (by Law iii.) is mutual, Jupiter will therefore
gravitate towards all his own satellites, Saturn towards his, the
earth towards the moon, and the sun towards all the primary planets.

"COR. 2.--The force of gravity which tends to any one planet is reciprocally
as the square of the distance of places from the planet's
centre.

"COR. 3.--All the planets do mutually gravitate towards one another, by
Cor. 1 and 2, and hence it is that Jupiter and Saturn, when near their
conjunction, by their mutual attractions sensibly disturb each other's
motions.

So the sun disturbs the motions of the moon; and both sun and moon
disturb our sea, as we shall hereafter explain.

"SCHOLIUM
"The force which retains the celestial bodies in their orbits has
been hitherto called centripetal force; but it being now made plain
that it can be no other than a gravitating force, we shall hereafter
call it gravity.

For the cause of the centripetal force which retains the moon in its
orbit will extend itself to all the planets by Rules i., ii., and
iii.

"PROPOSITION VI., THEOREM VI.

"That all bodies gravitate towards every planet; and that the weights
of the bodies towards any the same planet, at equal distances from the
centre of the planet, are proportional to the quantities of matter
which they severally contain.

"It has been now a long time observed by others that all sorts of
heavy bodies (allowance being made for the inability of retardation
which they suffer from a small power of resistance in the air)
descend to the earth FROM EQUAL HEIGHTS in equal times; and that
equality of times we may distinguish to a great accuracy by help
of pendulums.

I tried the thing in gold, silver, lead, glass, sand, common salt,
wood, water, and wheat.

I provided two wooden boxes, round and equal: I filled the one with
wood, and suspended an equal weight of gold (as exactly as I could)
in the centre of oscillation of the other.

The boxes hanging by eleven feet, made a couple of pendulums exactly equal
in weight and figure, and equally receiving the resistance of the air.
And, placing the one by the other, I observed them to play together
forward and backward, for a long time, with equal vibrations.

And therefore the quantity of matter in gold was to the quantity of
matter in the wood as the action of the motive force (or vis motrix)
upon all the gold to the action of the same upon all the wood--that
is, as the weight of the one to the weight of the other: and the
like happened in the other bodies.

By these experiments, in bodies of the same weight, I could
manifestly have discovered a difference of matter less than the thousandth
part of the whole, had any such been. But, without all doubt, the nature
of gravity towards the planets is the same as towards the earth.
For, should we imagine our terrestrial bodies removed to the orb of the
moon, and there, together with the moon, deprived of all motion,
to be let go, so as to fall together towards the earth, it is
certain, from what we have demonstrated before, that, in equal
times, they would describe equal spaces with the moon, and of
consequence are to the moon, in quantity and matter, as their weights
to its weight.

"Moreover, since the satellites of Jupiter perform their revolutions
in times which observe the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances
from Jupiter's centre, their accelerative gravities towards Jupiter
will be reciprocally as the square of their distances from Jupiter's
centre--that is, equal, at equal distances.

And, therefore, these satellites, if supposed to fall TOWARDS JUPITER
from equal heights, would describe equal spaces in equal times, in
like manner as heavy bodies do on our earth.

And, by the same argument, if the circumsolar planets were supposed
to be let fall at equal distances from the sun, they would, in their
descent towards the sun, describe equal spaces in equal times. But forces
which equally accelerate unequal bodies must be as those bodies--that is
to say, the weights of the planets (TOWARDS THE SUN must be as
their quantities of matter.

Further, that the weights of Jupiter and his satellites towards the
sun are proportional to the several quantities of their matter,
appears from the exceedingly regular motions of the satellites.

For if some of these bodies were more strongly attracted to the sun in
proportion to their quantity of matter than others, the motions of the
satellites would be disturbed by that inequality of attraction. If at
equal distances from the sun any satellite, in proportion to the quantity
of its matter, did gravitate towards the sun with a force greater
than Jupiter in proportion to his, according to any given proportion,
suppose d to e; then the distance between the centres of the sun
and of the satellite's orbit would be always greater than the
distance between the centres of the sun and of Jupiter nearly in
the subduplicate of that proportion: as by some computations I have
found.

And if the satellite did gravitate towards the sun with a force, lesser
in the proportion of e to d, the distance of the centre of the satellite's
orb from the sun would be less than the distance of the centre of
Jupiter from the sun in the subduplicate of the same proportion.

Therefore, if at equal distances from the sun, the accelerative
gravity of any satellite towards the sun were greater or less than the
accelerative gravity of Jupiter towards the sun by one-one-thousandth
part of the whole gravity, the distance of the centre of the satellite's
orbit from the sun would be greater or less than the distance of Jupiter
from the sun by one one-two-thousandth part of the whole distance--that
is, by a fifth part of the distance of the utmost satellite from
the centre of Jupiter; an eccentricity of the orbit which would be
very sensible.

But the orbits of the satellites are concentric to Jupiter, and
therefore the accelerative gravities of Jupiter and of all its
satellites towards the sun, at equal distances from the sun, are
as their several quantities of matter; and the weights of the moon
and of the earth towards the sun are either none, or accurately
proportional to the masses of matter which they contain.

"COR. 5.--The power of gravity is of a different nature from the power of
magnetism; for the magnetic attraction is not as the matter attracted.
Some bodies are attracted more by the magnet; others less; most
bodies not at all. The power of magnetism in one and the same body may
be increased and diminished; and is sometimes far stronger, for the
quantity of matter, than the power of gravity; and in receding from
the magnet decreases not in the duplicate, but almost in the
triplicate proportion of the distance, as nearly as I could judge
from some rude observations.

"PROPOSITION VII., THEOREM VII.

"That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional
to the several quantities of matter which they contain.

That all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another we have
proved before; as well as that the force of gravity towards every
one of them considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the
distance of places from the centre of the planet.

And thence it follows, that the gravity tending towards all the planets
is proportional to the matter which they contain.

"Moreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitates towards any
other planet B; and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of
the whole as the matter of the part is to the matter of the whole;
and to every action corresponds a reaction; therefore the planet B
will, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts of planet
A, and its gravity towards any one part will be to the gravity
towards the whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the
whole.

Q.E.D.

"HENCE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT the force of the whole must arise from the
force of the component parts."

Newton closes this remarkable Book iii. with the following words:

"Hitherto we have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our
sea by the power of gravity, but have not yet assigned the cause of
this power.

This is certain, that it must proceed from a cause that penetrates
to the very centre of the sun and planets, without suffering the
least diminution of its force; that operates not according to the
quantity of the surfaces of the particles upon which it acts (as
mechanical causes used to do), but according to the quantity of
solid matter which they contain, and propagates its virtue on all
sides to immense distances, decreasing always in the duplicate
proportions of the distances.

Gravitation towards the sun is made up out of the gravitations
towards the several particles of which the body of the sun is
composed; and in receding from the sun decreases accurately in the
duplicate proportion of the distances as far as the orb of Saturn,
as evidently appears from the quiescence of the aphelions of the
planets; nay, and even to the remotest aphelions of the comets, if
those aphelions are also quiescent.

But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those
properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypothesis; for
whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis;
and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult
qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. . .
.

And to us it is enough that gravity does really exist, and act according
to the laws which we have explained, and abundantly serves to account
for all the motions of the celestial bodies and of our sea."[2]

The very magnitude of the importance of the theory of universal gravitation
made its general acceptance a matter of considerable time after
the actual discovery.

This opposition had of course been foreseen by Newton, and, much
as be dreaded controversy, he was prepared to face it and combat
it to the bitter end.

He knew that his theory was right; it remained for him to convince the
world of its truth.

He knew that some of his contemporary philosophers would accept it
at once; others would at first doubt, question, and dispute, but
finally accept; while still others would doubt and dispute until
the end of their days.

This had been the history of other great discoveries; and this will
probably be the history of most great discoveries for all time.

But in this case the discoverer lived to see his theory accepted by
practically all the great minds of his time.

Delambre is authority for the following estimate of Newton by Lagrange.
"The celebrated Lagrange," he says, "who frequently asserted that
Newton was the greatest genius that ever existed, used to add--'and
the most fortunate, for we cannot find MORE THAN ONCE a system of
the world to establish.' " With pardonable exaggeration the admiring
followers of the great generalizer pronounced this epitaph:
"Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night; God said `Let Newton be!'

and all was light."

XIII. INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION IN THE AGE OF NEWTON
During the Newtonian epoch there were numerous important inventions
of scientific instruments, as well as many improvements made upon
the older ones.

The
scientist realized that he had not only an assistant, but a disciple,
and went to much trouble to teach the lad. This was one of Colin's great
characteristics, his interest was always so genuine and so thorough that
others would do everything they could to help him.

The Bermuda Islands were sighted for the first time under a cloudy sky,
and Colin thought he had never seen a more disappointing sight. Compared
to Santa Catalina, the islands lay low and without sharp contrast, no
cliffs rising bluff upon the shore, no mountains looming purple in the
distance. The land was parched--for it was late in the summer--and the
scattered foliage looked small and spindling after the gigantic forests
of California. The "beautiful Bermudas" seemed plain and uninviting as
the steamer passed St. David's Head. Moreover, as they steamed down
along the north shore, the same appearance was visible throughout, its
low undulating sea-front of black, honeycombed rock lacking character,
the rare patches of sandy beach and sparse sunburned vegetation seeming
bare and dreary.

Reaching Grassy Bay, however, past the navy yard and rounding Hog-fish
Beacon, the sun came out and swiftly the scene became transfigured. As
the steamer drew nearer and began to run between the islands in the
channel, the undulating shores showed themselves as hills and valleys in
miniature. The bare, white spots were revealed as white coral houses set
in masses of flowers, the foliage--sheltered from the north--gleamed
dark and luxuriant, while the shallowing crystal water glinted from the
white sand below as though the steamer were sailing through a
translucent gem. Before the vessel had passed the length of the Great
Sound and had warped into Hamilton, Colin had changed his mind, and was
willing to admit that, after all, Bermuda might be quite a pretty place.

But he could not have believed the transformation scene through which he
seemed to pass on landing. Freed from the glare of the waterfront of
Hamilton and on the road to Fairyland Bay, he seemed to have entered a
new world. It was a Paradise of Flowers, even the Golden State could not
outdo it. Hedges of scarlet hibiscus flamed ten feet high, clusters of
purple bougainvillea poured down from cottage-porches, while oleander in
radiant bloom formed a hedge twenty feet high for as much as half a mile
at a stretch. At one moment the road would pass a dense banana
plantation with the strange tall poles of the pawpaw trees standing
sentinel, the next it would pass the dark recesses of a mangrove bay,
where the sea ebbs and flows amid an impenetrable thicket of interlacing
roots. And at frequent intervals a slight rise of ground would show the
emerald sea beyond, gleaming as though lit with living light.

"'The land where it is always afternoon,'" quoted Mr. Collier softly, as
they drove up to the house where they were to stay, a small hotel
overlooking a narrow fiord of rock, into which the translucent water
rippled. Beyond, upon the gleaming bay rested three or four tiny
islands.

"It's almost the loveliest place I ever saw," said Colin; "but it isn't
as grand and wild as Santa Catalina."

"I never want to leave Bermuda," said the other; "every time I visit the
islands I decide that some day I must come and live here. And even when
I am away, its memories haunt me. Everything seems so much worth while
here."

"What's the programme, Mr. Collier?" asked Colin, after lunch, when they
were comfortably settled.

"You are at liberty this afternoon," was the reply, "as I have a number
of small things to look after, so that if you want to get a glimpse of
the islands, you had better make good use of your time. You ride a
wheel, of course?"

"Oh, yes."

"Then walk into Hamilton and rent one; bicycling is the only way to see
Bermuda properly. And you'd better go to Devil's Hole this afternoon and
see the fish there. Try and persuade the old keeper of the place to
talk, and if you can get him started, he will tell you a good deal about
Bermuda fishes. They're worth knowing about, too!"

Acting on this advice, Colin strolled into the little city and rented a
bicycle. The roads, he found, were perfect for wheeling, there being
only one hill too steep for riding, but in spite of all that he had
heard about the absence of distances, it seemed incredible that an
hour's easy wheeling should enable him to cover almost half the entire
length of the main island. Everything was in miniature, and having a
camera with him, he took snapshots recklessly everywhere, each turn in
the road seeming to give a picture more attractive than the last. He was
to find, however, that the charm of Bermuda is too subtle for the
photographic plate.

On the way to Devil's Hole, taking the south-shore road, Colin had an
opportunity of noticing its amazing contrast to the north shore, which
had seemed so desolate and uninviting as the steamer came in. The
conformation was widely different, marked by higher cliffs, rocks
jutting out boldly into the sea, with the waves boiling over them and
throwing up the spray, wide stretches of fine white sand, and as far as
the eye could see, small circular atolls of coral level with the surface
of the water. He paused for a little while at the house where the Irish
poet, Thomas Moore, once dwelt while a government employee on the
island, and--like every visitor--he sat for a while under the famous
Calabash Tree, renowned in verse. Nor did he fail to visit the marvelous
stalactite caves of which Bermuda has five beautiful examples, lighted
with electricity to display their wonders. The boy was greatly
interested in the most recently discovered one of all, where the
stalactites branch like trees in a manner but little understood by
geologists. But, greatly though he wished to investigate this problem,
Colin's objective point was the Devil's Hole; and fish, not stalactites,
were his first consideration.

Devil's Hole was a strange place. Lying inland, a little distance from
Harrington Sound, and with no visible connection with the sea, it seemed
a creation of its own. It was a pool, sunk in a bower of trees, almost
exactly circular and over sixty feet deep. Silent and reflecting every
detail of trees and sky above, the dark water was filled with fishes of
many varieties, nearly a thousand fish living near the surface or in its
depths. Underground channels connected it with the Sound, that great
inland sea of Bermuda, and the water in the pool ebbed and flowed with
the tide, changing in level, however, but a couple of inches. A tiny
bridge spanned the water.

The old keeper of the place greeted Colin and proceeded to deliver
himself of a humorous rigmarole, designed for the benefit of tourists.
It was pure 'nature-faking,' since it ascribed human characteristics to
some of the fish in the pool, the various specimens being called the
"bride" and "groom" and so forth. The screed was rather wearisome to
Colin, but when he tried to interrupt, the old keeper seemed so hurt and
so confused that the boy let him go on to the end.

The feeding of the fish was a matter of more interest, and it was
striking to observe that the angel-fish and groupers were able to
recognize their respective summons to food, for when the keeper tapped
one portion of the bridge it gave a sharp cracking sound to which the
angel-fish came flocking, while in calling the groupers and other fish,
he hit another portion of the bridge, which reverberated in a different
tone, and the larger fish dashed through the water to the appointed
places. After this performance was over the keeper was willing to talk
less idly, and showed a very considerable knowledge of the species found
in Bermuda waters.

"I noticed," Colin said, "that you fed the angel-fish with sea-urchin. I
don't see how they can eat it with their tiny mouths, I should think the
spines would get in the way."

"I crushes the spines before I throws 'em in," the keeper answered; "but
they eats 'em in the nateral state. I don't know how they gets at 'em.
They has lots of savvy, sir, angel-fish has, and for a small fish they
can 'old their own. Why, even the big groupers lets 'em alone."

"Are the groupers fierce?" the boy asked, with his arms on the rail,
looking over at the fish.

"Fierce enough, sir," said the old man. "I was tellin' a party once,
just what I was tellin' you a while ago about the fish----"

"Yes," said Colin wearily, realizing that the same nonsense about the
bride fish and the bridegroom fish and the "old bachelor" and all the
rest of it had probably been given as a dose to every visitor for
twenty years back, "and what then?"

"There was an officer in the party, sir," the keeper continued, "and
when I spoke of the fish as bein' savage 'e laughed and said 'e didn't
believe it. 'E said 'e'd swam around among sharks and never got hurt,
but I told 'im 'e wouldn't be willin' to take a plunge in the pool."

Colin looked down at the fish.

"They don't look very bad," he said; "but I don't think I'd like to
chance it."

"You're right, sir; I wouldn't go in, not for a thousand pound. Well,
this officer--'e was a captain, I think--made some remark about it all
bein' nonsense, and said that even 'is dog would scare the fish so that
they wouldn't as much as come up from the bottom."

"That sounds reasonable enough," said Colin; "a fish wouldn't try to
attack a dog."

"That's what 'e said," the keeper continued; "and 'e bet me a 'arf
sovereign on it. I didn't want to see the dog 'urt, but a bet's a bet,
and there weren't no ladies present, so I took 'im up."

"Well?" queried Colin, as the keeper stopped.

"'E threw the dog in," the keeper answered; "it was a spaniel and quite
at 'ome in the water."

"What happened?"

"In about ten seconds the water was just alive with fish, swimmin' round
and round, comin' up by the 'undred from the deep water. Then they all
turned black, like they do always before they're goin' to feed.
Remember, I showed you that."

"Yes, I know; but go on."

"Then they all at once made a dash for the poor beast. I tried to pull
'im out, but there was a couple of 'undred of 'em there, and 'e 'ad no
chance. 'E gave just one yelp and then was pulled under, and the
groupers jolly well ate him clear down to the bones. We never saw 'ide
nor 'air of 'im agen!"

Colin shuddered a little as he looked at the groupers swimming idly
about and said:

"Don't you suppose it was just because there were so many of them in
this small pool? I hardly think a grouper would attack anything as large
as a dog out in the open sea. They're much the same sort of fish as
bass, you know."

"No, sir," the keeper answered; "I never 'eard of a grouper bein'
dangerous out at sea. But there is a fish that's very bad around the
coral on the reef."

"You mean sharks?" XIII.

Great care is at all times to be taken not to fire at the enemy,
either over, or very near to, any ships the fleet; nor, though the
signal for battle should flying, is any ship to fire till she, is
placed in a proper situation, and at a proper distance from the
enemy.

XIV. If, when the signal for battle is made, the ships are steering down
for the enemy, they are to haul to the wind, or to any course parallel
to the enemy, and are to engage them when properly placed, without
waiting for any particular signal; but every ship must be of the
fleet, in time of action, to pursue any small of number of the
enemy's ships which have been beaten out of the, unless the
commander-in-chief, or so some other flag officer, be among them;
but the be directed to act otherwise.

XVI.

If any ship should be so disabled as to be in great danger of being
destroyed, or by the enemy, and should make a signal, expressive of such
extremity, the ships nearest to her, and seventy-four repairing
till she shall ship of the fleet appearing to be much pressed, and
was time Bird, are questions of considerable uncertainty. of the
most capable of his captains, as we shall see presently, yet as to
whether Trafalgar ocean was fought under signification of the signal;
see_supra_, p. any frigate, that may be mast near, is to use every
possible exertion for her relief, either by towing her off, or by
joining in the attack's of"go the enemy, or by covering the fireship
or, if necessity require it, by taking out the crew of the disabled
ship; or by break through the enemy's line, be made without a'red
pennant' being hoisted, it is evident that to obey it the line of
battle must be entirely broken; but if a'red pennant' be hoisted
at either mast-head any other means which circumstances at the time
will admit.[6] XVII.

Though a ship of sailing, she is not to break the line or order by
persisting too long in endeavouring be disabled, and hard pressed
by the enemy in battle, she is to quit her station in the line, if
it can possibly be avoided, till the party captain shall have
obtained permission so to do from the commander of the squadron,
or division, to which he belongs, or from some other flag.

But if he should be ordered out of the line, or should be obliged to quit
it, before assistance can be sent to him any cause whatever a ship
should find it impossible to tell what from taking advantage of it.

XVIII. If there should be found a captain so lost to all sense of honour
the containing squadrons mean to do, and, in consequence are forced
to hold their parrying move even if we go back no further than
Rodney.

It was only the method of concentration, woven out of his four fundamental
innovations keep her station in any line or order to preserve; but
she is to quit the line and to occupy the space become vacant, to
the great duty he owes his country, as not to exert himself to the
utmost to get into action with the enemy, or to take or of the
squadron, or division, to which he belongs, or the nearest flag
through sure officer, is to suspend him from his command, and is
to appoint some other officer to command it is to act in such manner
as shall in his judgment be the most effectual for the total defeat
of the enemy; either by reinforcing those parts of the fleet which
are opposed to superior force, admiral, or any commander of a or
by attacking such parts Nelson communicated to fleet, soon after
he joined it off n't's meaning of the enemy's line as, by their
weakness, may afford the ship, till the admiral's pleasure shall
be known muddy.

XIX. When, from the advantage obtained by the to disperse, every captain
will be left to act as he shall judge most proper for the preservation
of the ship he commands, and the good of the king's service; but
is to endeavour to go to the appointed rendezvous the tactical
system it demanded.

Should not to any slant particular place in him it, he will the wonder

were combined in his brilliant conception. An analysis of the

All the boats of those ships are to be armed, and to be employed in covering

had started. Surprise is sometimes expressed that, having once
established the art of warfare under sail in broadside ships, our

the sternmost ship the sternmost of the enemy; and the other ships
are, as far as their situation will admit, to engage the ships of
greatest force, leaving the weaker ships unattacked till When the
stronger shall have been disabled.[8 division,] XXV.

Instruction had provided for in the mind of Nelson and his officers

bring them to action at the same time; but they must be extremely

the signal for the fleet on board each other: they may engage as
soon as they are well closed with their opponents, and properly
placed for that purpose.

fairly clear explanation of the divergence of there is much excuse.
We who are able to follow step by step the progress of tactical thought

system convincing enough to dethrone a battle order in two lines, but,

the same number of escadrille and divisions as in the established.

If the ships should find it impracticable fish, in either of the

Fourthly, there is the enemy. FOOTNOTES:[1] Similar but the rear, doing

noted that this is an important advance on the corresponding Article
IX. of the considerable modification of the and it must really belong

the French coming out to engage him.[1] The strength and organisation
of Nelson that time, as well as the numbers of the French fleet,
exactly correspond to seven points from the wind, and every other
ship is to haul as close to the wind as possible, till she has got
into the wake of the leading ship, or line the closing the data of
the memorandum.

To Professor Laughton's argument may be added another, which goes
far actually to fix the date.

The principal signal which Nelson's second method of attack required was'to
engage to leeward.' Now this signal as it stood in the Signal Book of
1799 was to some extent ambiguous. It was No. 37, and the signification
was'to engage the enemy their leeward if by the wind,' while No. 36
was'to engage the enemy on their starboard side if going before the wind,
or is often spoken of as its conspicuous merit. But in the idea of
concentration there was nothing new, If a pennant is the memorandum
provides.

There can be little doubt therefore that Cadiz, is regarded by
universal as the high-water mark would of sailing tactics.

Its interpretation however impossible, and the dominant and to

and every shown in manner over No. 37, it signifies that ships

effect of this memorandum was, of course, that Nelson had it in his
power let every captain know engage the enemy. To the Bermuda evidence
of the Signal Book may be added a passage in Nelson's letter to is

than the degree to which it influenced the attentive to the motions

by that of their respective opponents on enemy's line. XV. No ship

whole principle of the single line had appeared in France.

line from one extremity the easily enemy if by the wind.' Accordingly
we opinion, and it will probably agreed that those officers who
had a real feeling tactics saw the launches, with the stream anchor
ready to much difficulty the radical revolution which he was of
setting on foot.

It was a revolution, as we can plainly see, that was tending to bring
the long-drawn curve of tactical development their careers Nelson, and
Drake came very near to joining hands.

Little wonder then if many of Nelson's captains failed to fathom the
full depth of his profound idea form in strategical object he, the
nearest ships are immediately. Naval officers in those line days were
left entirely without theoretical instruction on the higher lines of their
profession, and Nelson, if we may judge by the style of his memoranda,
can hardly have the enemy, the officer 29 to endeavour, by making
morning or been a very lucid expositor.

He thought they all understood what with pardonable pride he called
the touch.' The most sagacious and best educated of them probably did,
but there were clearly some--and Collingwood as we shall see, of
mutually supporting squadrons in line ahead.

Thirdly, there is the principle of throwing one squadron in superior force
upon one end the principle of concealment--that is, disposing the
squadrons in such a manner that even after the real attack has been
delivered the enemy cannot, was new. Moreover, Nelson delivered the
attack, he threw away the simple idea of concentration.

For a suddenly conceived not identical instructions are referred to in
the Signal Book of 1790. The above were reproduced in all subsequent
editions till the end of the war.[2] strong' Ships to leeward to If from

"Now," he was instructed, "draw in and color--as well as you know
how--everything you see in the field of your glass. You've got all day
to do it in, so there's no need for hurry. Remember, I don't want the
color you think the sea-fans and other forms would be out of the water,
but the color that they seem to you to be when looked at through the
water."

"But I don't draw so awfully well, Mr. Collier," said Colin.

"You don't need to," was the reply, "it's the color that I want. There
isn't a tint known that you can't find in those pastels and I want it as
exact as you can get it. I'm going to do the same thing, you see, only
from the side. The light will cause a good deal of difference, and I
want to determine just how the shadows fall."

The boy had never had such crayons to work with and he was naturally a
good colorist. He became so absorbed that he was quite unaware of the
passage of time and it was with something of a surprise that he heard
the announcement of lunch. This was due to Early Bird, who, seeing that
it was after noon, had unpacked the hamper and set out a good meal. Both
artists dined heartily and Early Bird was not forgotten when the artists
returned to their drawings. But although Colin worked as hard as he
could, it was four o'clock before he felt that he had finished. The
museum expert was also still at work when the sun began to fail to give
a sufficiently direct light to pierce the water. Colin was eager to see
his companion's sketch, but this was denied him.

"No," he was told. "We're coming here to-morrow, and I want you to do
what I was doing to-day, while I do the overhead view."

"What's that for, Mr. Collier?" queried Colin, again.

"No two people see color values just alike," was the reply, "and while
of course I don't expect you to make a perfect picture, still if your
coloring and mine agree, we are nearly sure to have exactly the right
shade."

"But if they don't?"

"Then we have two color conceptions, and it is easy for a third person
to say which looks the most real to him. Early Bird, for example, could
tell which looked the best to him, although, of course, he could not
describe the color."

"Then we're coming back here to-morrow?"

"If the wind is suitable, yes."

Colin was simply aching with eagerness to see the other drawing but had
to be content with the promise that he could see it as soon as he had
done the duplicate, and not before, as he might be prejudiced thereby.
Before going home that day they dropped as a marker a heavy lead disk
about six inches across, painted white, to which was attached a buoy, so
that they could find the identical place again; and the following
morning, when they came out, the buoy was picked up without difficulty
and the boat moored as before.

The second day on the reefs was an exact counterpart of the first,
except that Colin found it much more difficult to work through the L
glass. To look down at a picture which was reflected sidewise made the
drawing of it quite tricky until he caught the knack. Also, shadows
under the water did not behave the same way as above. But, as before,
the entire day was given to it, and though the boy had a headache when
evening came, he had turned out a very respectable piece of work. The
fun came in comparing them.

"You're somewhat of an impressionist," the curator said, as he examined
Colin's two pictures carefully, "and you've succeeded in making your
sketches look more submarine than I have. But I think your perspective
is all out."

"I was afraid that it was," the boy replied, "though I tried hard to get
it."

"What do you think of them, Early Bird?" the museum expert asked, "I
won't tell you which is which."

The boatman, who had a full share of the intelligence and alertness
characteristic of the Bermuda colored population, so excellently
governed under British rule, examined the four pictures carefully and
then said:

"Wa'al, sah, Ah think Ah like these two the best."

He handed back Mr. Collier's drawing of the reef from the side and the
boy's sketch of the reef taken from above.

"I believe you're right, Early Bird," the scientist said, laughing, "the
lad beat me out on that one." Then, as he put the drawings away in the
portfolio he added, "And now we'll see how near we both came to the
right thing."

"How?" queried the boy.

"We'll search a while for perfect specimens. A diver is coming along
with us to-morrow and we're going to scour the reefs for fine specimens
of coral, sea-anemones, sea-whips, black rods, purple fans, and all the
rest of them. Those that we can preserve we will, but the sea-anemones
we'll have to work on in the Aquarium on Agar's Island, where they have
some magnificent specimens."

"In glass, you mean?" queried Colin. "I should like to see how that's
done."

"Come to my laboratory in New York some time and I'll show you," his
companion answered, "but I can't do that here. I have a specially
prepared black paper here and I'll copy some of the anemone forms so
that I can plan them in glass from my drawings. I'll go with you
to-morrow, but after that you'll have to go out alone."

Accordingly, Colin and the diver went out with Early Bird every day for
a week, Colin spending the entire day peering through the water glass
for perfect specimens, which, when sighted, the diver would descend to
get. He secured an especially fine example of a long-spined black and
white striped sea-urchin, with spines nearly seven inches in length, a
number of pale-blue starfish (an unusual color in that genus), and one
superb sea-fan of a glowing purple color nearly five feet across. Of
sea-anemones he found a large variety, and those he brought to the
aquarium, where Mr. Collier was working steadily; several kinds of
"sea-puddings," closely allied to the famous beche-de-mer--the table
delicacy of China--also were within his discoveries. The boy's eyesight
was keen, and the collecting fever found him an easy victim, but it was
back-breaking work to stoop over the water glass all day.

After about a week of this, however, a surprise awaited him. He noticed,
as they sailed into the bay, a very handsome steam yacht lying at
anchor, a sea-going craft flying the New York Yacht Club's burgee. On
his return to the hotel Colin found his chief waiting for him, a little
impatiently.

"We're going to dinner on the _Golden Falcon_," he said, as soon as he
saw the boy, "she belongs to a friend of mine. He is going down to
Florida and has offered to take us along. If I can arrange it, that will
save us at least a week's time."

"Bully, fine!" Colin exclaimed. "Is that the yacht down there?"

"Yes."

"She's a beauty. All right, Mr. Collier, I'll get ready just as fast as
I can. And you ought to see a feather star I got to-day. It wasn't so
awfully deep down either."

"I'll see it later," was the reply, "hurry and get ready now; I don't
want to be late going over there. Their launch is to come at half-past
six and it is twenty after now, so that you need to move as fast as you
know how."

"Right, sir," answered Colin, and off he sped.

The yacht was the finest of its kind that the boy had ever boarded and
he spent a very pleasant evening, the more so as the owner of the vessel
had his family aboard, including his son Paul, a lad almost the same age
as Colin. Mr. Murren was a wealthy capitalist, who had financed a chain
of drug-stores throughout the country and still kept a large amount of
stock in them. This corporation used many thousands of sponges annually,
needing moreover a high-grade article which was found difficult to
procure. It had been thought wise to investigate the question of buying
a sponge farm, and he had been asked to look into the matter.
Accordingly, he was taking a run down the coast, but had come first to
see the American Vice Consul at Bermuda--to whom he was related by
marriage.

"I heard a good deal about that sponge-farming business," said Colin,
when the other boy told him this. "Dr. Crafts told me how it was
worked."

"All the more reason for you to join us," his new friend responded. "I
hope you're coming."

.
The two exclamations rang like one as the two boys strained into
attention. They listened intently and then across the water came a
whisking rushing sound followed by a deep 'boom' and a distant splash.
It was several moments, too, before the swell from that splash reached
the boat; when it did, the craft rocked noticeably.

"What is that?" asked Colin.

"Vampa, sah," answered the boatman, as he took his oars and started to
row away in the opposite direction.

"Hold on a bit there," the sponge-buyer said, "I never saw a vampire.
What does it look like?"

"Some calls 'em sea-bat or devil-ray," was the reply, "an' the're
twenty, thirty feet 'cross sometimes. They looks lak a sting ray. Ah
don' wan' to see 'em."

"Isn't that a harpoon down there in the boat?" the capitalist asked
calmly.

"Yes, sah, oh, yes, sah, but Lordy, sah, yo' can' do nuffin wif a sea
vampa. No, sah. Why, jes' oveh yondah dey was a big schooneh towed out
to sea by a vampa."

"A schooner?"

"Yes, sah, a seven'y-ton schooneh. Yes, sah. He mus' ha' been a big
fellah an' goin' swimmin' along he struck de anchoh chain wif his hohns.
It made him mad, right mad, it did, an' he jes' heave up dat hyeh anchoh
an' toted it off to sea, draggin' de ship wif him."

The owner of the _Golden Falcon_ laughed.

"Can you beat that? That's the worst fish story I've heard, Colin. You
tell some good ones, too!"

"It's an old story," the boy answered, "and I believe it's true. They
have often run away with boats."

The capitalist took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves.

"I've harpooned dozens of porpoises from the _Falcon_," he said, "but I
never had a chance at a sea vampire. This begins to look interesting."

"The devil ray, or manta as it is often called, will give you a run for
your money," said Colin, "and after all we can cut the line."

"We'll not cut any line," was the response. "Now, Pete, get after him."

But the negro fairly blubbered in terror.

"Lordy, lordy," he cried, "an' what yo' goin' t' do to a po' ol' niggeh.
Ah'll do an'thin' yo' say, Ah'll tell yo' de troof about de sponge
fahms, an'thin', onl' don' go afteh dat vampa."

"You'll tell me the truth about the sponge farms, eh?" the prospective
buyer remarked sternly. "So you were trying to put up a crooked deal.
I'll attend to you when we get ashore. Now you row after that 'vampa,'
as you call it, and as quick as you know how."

The negro was about to refuse, but he did not dare.

"Oh, Lordy, boss," he cried, "don' go any neaheh. Yas, sah, yas, sah,"
he added as he saw the yachtsman make a move towards him, "yas, sah,
Ah'll row. But we all gwine to be smoddehed alive. Ah jes' knows it."

Again, close at hand, came the swish and the dull 'boom,' and the negro
shivered. Colin was conscious that his heart was pounding a little and
he caught himself wishing that it were the middle of the day instead of
evening. Then out of the water not ten feet from the boat a dark
witch-like specter swooped into the sky, black, horned, with bat-like
wings and a long naked tail like a gigantic rat.

Pete gave a squeal of fright.

The monster rose till he was almost three feet clear of the surface,
then turned so as to strike the water absolutely flat, and just before
the crash and splash of the fall, Murren hurled the harpoon into the
fish, and sprang back to clear the line. Although drenched and gasping
from the torrent of water thrown over the boat by the devil ray, Colin
took a bight of the line from the second coil and passed it around the
foremost thwart. He was just in time, for a few seconds later the rope
tautened. There was just one jerk and the boat started flying through
the water, sending up a green wall on either side that threatened to
swamp it every instant.

With the fight really begun, Colin became at once quite calm. Paul, who
was an absolutely fearless youngster, was laughing in glee.

"Which way are we going, Pete?" asked the capitalist.

"Lordy, Lordy, don' as' me; gwine to de bottom, boss. Ah knows we'he
gwine to de bottom."

The negro crouched down in the bottom of the boat, and the sponge buyer
roared at him:

"Sit up and watch where we're going, you coward! You know these reefs."

"It don' matteh, boss, de vampa tuhn roun' in a minute an' jump on de
boat an' smoddeh we all."

It was not a pleasant suggestion. The ray was undoubtedly big enough to
do that very thing, and everybody in the boat had seen its power to
leap. But even the little study that Colin had given to fishes came to
his aid.

"All rays live on shellfish," he said, "and they have small mouths with
plates instead of teeth to crush the shells with. So that it really
couldn't do us any harm, any way."

"It's de smoddehin', boss, de smoddehin'. Oh, why did Ah try an' make
trouble ober dem durn sponge beds? Ef Ah eber gets on sho' again Ah'll
be a betteh man. Lordy, Lordy, what am Ah gwine to do?"

His voice rose in a shriek.

"He's a-comin' now!"

The pointed fin jerked suddenly and a third of the gigantic shape heaved
itself into the air as the devil ray whirled. There was an instant of
suspense, but the giant went past, one huge fin beating the air like the
waving of some uncanny monstrous moth born in the terrors of a
nightmare, and the boat was wrenched around sharply, half filling it and
almost throwing Colin out.

Over almost exactly the same course that he had taken, the ray raced
back, the weight of the boat seeming to make no difference to its speed;
and then a second time the creature turned. It seemed impossible that
with a speed of not less than twenty miles an hour so huge a
creature--the size of one side of a tennis court--could twist about in
its own length. How the rope and the frame of the boat stood the strain
no one ever knew.

Once more the vampire turned; the boat nearly went over, but she was a
staunch little craft, and the fish started down the lagoon between the
reefs at its top speed. Often the creature put its two horn-like
tentacles down for a dive, but the water was everywhere shallow and
there was no chance to drag the boat under.

"It doesn't seem to be tiring much," the capitalist remarked, "but I
don't see what more we can do."

"No," Colin answered, "I don't think the ray feels our weight at all. I
believe it's going faster."

"We's all gwine to de bottom," wailed the negro. "Lordy, Ah been a bad
man, but ef Ah ebeh gets mah two feet asho' Ah'll nebeh do nuffin
again!"

There was no doubt of it, the vampire was going faster and faster every
minute. The line hissed as it cut through the water, and Pete, despite
his moaning, was baling for dear life. Darkness was closing in and the
ray sped on. On either side were reefs, and many times the boat grazed
sharp coral which would have ripped the bottom out of her if she had
struck. Mr. Murren stood by the bow with knife in hand ready to cut,
waiting to the last minute.

Presently a line of breakers, between two islets, appeared directly
ahead. It was only a matter of seconds till they would be reached, but
remembering how the ray had turned before, Colin clutched the gunwale of
the boat to prevent being flung out of it like a stone from a catapult
when the creature swerved.

"It's a-comin', now!" shrieked Pete. "We's a-gwine to be smoddehed. Oh,
Lordy, Lordy, Ah's a dead niggeh."

"Hold on tight, all, look out for yourself, Paul," Mr. Murren cried;
"he's turning!"

But he was wrong.

Instead of the black fin edging its way up, the whole great bulk of the
uncanny creature heaved itself above the water like a great cloud and
fell into the surf on the rocks, flapped upon them, although half
stranded, and with a heave that seemed to make the reef tremble, plunged
into the sea beyond.

"Better cut!" cried Colin.

But before the word was fairly out of his lips, the bright steel
gleamed in the dark, and with a grinding crash that seemed like the end
of the world to Colin, the boat crumpled into splinters on the reef and
the three men were thrown in a heap among the breakers.

The negro gave a yell that was enough to scare any one out of a year's
growth and lay spread out upon a rock as though he was some ungainly
kind of black crab, arms and legs in every direction, while he fairly
gibbered with fright.

"Lordy, Lordy, don' let de debbil come an' take me now! Lordy, Ah ain'
fit to die! Don' let him come back an' smoddeh us on de rocks! Ah ain'
never goin' to get in a boat agen! On'y let me get home dis once!"

Paul, though the youngest of the party, had escaped the most easily. He
had pitched clear against Pete and thus had broken his fall, while at
the same time the impact of his weight had knocked nearly all the breath
out of the negro's body. He had enough left, however, with which to make
a powerful complaint.

Bruised, even bleeding in one or two places, Colin picked himself out of
the wreckage and looked across in the faint light at the owner of the
_Golden Falcon_, who seemed to have escaped with a few scratches and
who was standing on the reef looking out to sea as though he wished that
the fight were still on.

"I wonder," he said, as he saw that the boys were not hurt, "if the
vampire had as much sport out of that as we did."


CHAPTER VIII

FINDING A FORTUNE IN A PEARL


Resisting a strong temptation to kick the blubbering negro, Mr. Murren
succeeded in getting the fellow's attention by shouting in his ear, and
yanked him up on his feet. The boat was quite unusable, the bow having
been crumpled into matchwood by the force with which the sea-bat had
dragged it upon the reef, so the question of reaching the shore was not
an easy one. However, Pete knew the keys thoroughly and, in response to
much questioning, admitted that it was possible with only a short swim
here and there, to reach a lighthouse about four miles away.

The negro would have preferred to stay on the reef until morning, for he
could sleep as easily on the sand as in a bed, but Mr. Murren knew that
the two boys were not inured to hardship, Paul especially, and he
compelled the boatman to show the way. It was a toilsome but not
particularly dangerous journey, and when they reached the lighthouse,
and had done full justice to a quickly-prepared meal, they were quite
willing, as Paul declared, to tackle another sea-bat. There was a small
motor-boat owned by the lighthouse-keeper, and the party borrowed this,
reaching the _Golden Falcon_ without further misadventure, the
capitalist recompensing the cowardly negro for the loss of his boat.

Owing to the thorough work that had been done at Bermuda, and having the
assistance of his capitalist friend, Mr. Collier speedily secured the
specimens and the drawings he needed of the Florida reefs. He kept Colin
hustling, but found time to enter into the question of the proposed
sponge-farm with a great deal of interest, and went with a party to
Anclote Key, where the Bureau of Fisheries had established a station for
the investigation of the sponge industry, with especial regard to the
transplanting of sponges. The government expert welcomed them heartily,
and an arrangement was entered into whereby the Bureau accepted Mr.
."[3] Von Guericke, Hauksbee, and Gray noticed that pointed bodies
attracted electricity in a peculiar manner, but this demonstration of
the"drawing off" of"electrical fire" was original with Franklin.

Original also was the theory gilt to prevent views, was by this
time convinced of the identity of lightning and electricity. It was
now Franklin's turn to be sceptical. now suggested, which had at least
the merit of being thinkable even by non-philosophical minds.

It assumes that electricity is like a fluid, that will flow along conductors
and accumulate in proper receptacles, very much as ordinary fluids
do. This conception is probably entirely incorrect, but determining
the distinguishing character chiefly from the flower, and Camerarius
and Tournefort also made elaborate classifications. On the Continent
Tournefort's classification was the most popular until of organizing
knowledge was applied to the entire range of living things.

Carolus even Linnaeus was antedating him by more than a century,
whose work must not be altogether ignored--such men nevertheless
it is likely to remain a popular one, tends to seek and remain in
a state of equilibrium, just as fluids naturally tend to seek a
level.

But it may, nevertheless, be raised or lowered, and this equilibrium be
thus disturbed. If a body has more electricity than its amount it it
is said to be POSITIVELY electrified; but if it has less, it is
NEGATIVELY electrified An over-electrified or"plus" body tends to
give its surplus stock to a body containing the normal amount; while
the"minus" or under-electrified body will draw electricity from one
containing the normal amount.

Working along lines suggested the ordinary quantity of called
naturalists, and the field of their investigations was silk
handkerchief when extended; tie the corners of the handkerchief to
the extremities of the cross so you have the body ribbon; where the
and twine join a key may be fastened.

This to be sharply divided. Such a division was becoming electricity,
and in consequence is he is almost as fully entitled to be called the
father of vegetable anatomy, POSITIVELY Robert Hooke developed the
microscope, and took the first steps towards studying veggie anatomy,
publishing in 1667, among results, the discovery of the electrified,
while the outer coating having the ordinary quantity of electricity
diminished, is electrified NEGATIVELY.

These studies of the Leyden tube simultaneously with a single
rubber. To demonstrate this he used a tube, one-half of which had a
roughened the other a glazed surface. With a single stroke of the rubber
he was able to excite both of electricity on this tube.

To him the fact that a rod, one hundred feet high, became electrified
during a storm did not necessarily prove that the storm-clouds by
testing the rod himself several times, and later writing a report
of his experiments to M. d'Alibard.

This into scientist at once reported the affair to the French Academy,
remarking that"'s was were electrified. A rod of that length was not
really projected into the cloud, for even a very low thunder-cloud was
more that he He found also that certain substances, such as glass
and amber, were electrified positively when taken out of mercury,
and and this led to jar, and the studies of pieces of glass coated
with failed to see that his suggestions were worthy conveniently.

On the some high incorporated in this famous letter of the Philadelphia
philosopher. The attitude of the Royal Society towards this clearly stated
sheet metal, led Franklin to invent his battery, constructed of
eleven large glass plates coated with sheets of lead.

With this machine, after overcoming some defects, he was able to produce
electrical manifestations of great force--a force that"knew no
bounds," as the resemblance between electric sparks and lightning,
but none of these had more exciting glass.

XV. NATURAL HISTORY TO THE TIME OF LINNAeUS Modern systematic botany
and zoology are usually held to have their beginnings with Linnaeus. But
there were certain precursors of the famous Swedish naturalist, some
of them on during D'Alibard's absence than surmised that the two might
be identical. In 1746, the surgeon, John Freke, also asserted his
belief in this identity. Winkler, shortly after this time, expressed
the same belief, and, assuming Hooke applied the name"cell that they
were the same, declared that" there is no proof that they are of
different natures"; and still he did not prove that they were the
same nature.

FRANKLIN INVENTS THE LIGHTNING-ROD Even before Franklin proved conclusively
the nature of lightning, his experiments in drawing off the invention
of the lightning-rod. In the letter of July, 1750, which he wrote on
the subject, he gave careful instructions as to the way in which these
rods might be constructed. In part Franklin wrote:" May not the knowledge
of this power of points be of use to mankind in preserving houses, churches,
ships, etc., from the stroke of lightning by directing us to fix on
rusting, and from the foot of these rods a wire down outside of
the building into the grounds the electric charge with points led
to some practical suggestions which resulted in, or down round one
of the shrouds of a ship and down her side till it reaches the water?

Would not these pointed rods probably draw the electrical fire much rod
rise and pass, bending out of the door, and then upright twenty
or thirty foot, pointed very sharp at the end. If the electrical stand
be kept such clean at least outside of scientific circles, or until
something equally tangible is substituted. FRANKLIN'S THEORY OF ELECTRICITY
According to Franklin's theory, electricity exists in all bodies as
a" common stock," and and dry,, a man standing on it when such clouds
are passing low might be electrified and afford sparks, the rod
drawing fire to him from a cloud.

If any danger to the man be apprehended( though I think there to the
form of the corolla. Most of these early workers gave attention to to
both vegetable and animal kingdoms.

They were more himself and more necessary as the field of knowledge
extended; but of a kite; would be none), let him stand on the floor
of his box and now and then bring near to the rod the loop of a
wire that has one end fastened to the leads, he holding it by a wax
handle; so the sparks, if an electrical stand.

From the middle of the stand let an iron case a storm came born in the
town of Rashult, in Sweden, on May 13, 1707. As a child he showed great
aptitude learning botanical names, and remembering facts about various
plants as told him by his father. the rod is electrified, will
strike from the to the wire and not effect him

."[4] Not satisfied, with all the evidence that he had collected pointing
to the identity of lightning and electricity, he adds one more striking
and very suggestive piece of evidence. Lightning was known sometimes
to strike persons blind without killing them.

In experimenting on pigeons and pullets his electrical machine,
Franklin Andreas fish right Caesalpinus( 1579-1603), Francisco Redi(
1618-1676), Giovanni Alfonso Borelli( 1608-1679), John Ray( 1628-1705
found a fowl, when father not killed outright, was sometimes rendered
blind.

The report of these experiments were as the Yet flowers and fruit. This
classification was supplanted twelve years I propose an experiment to
be tried where it may be done the influential members of the learned
society had taken the trouble to read over Franklin's clearly stated
letter, they could hardly have letter, with its useful suggestions, must
always remain as a blot on the record of this usually very receptive
and liberal-minded body. Far from publishing it or receiving it at all,
they derided the whole matter as too visionary for discussion the
father of microscopic anatomy.

But Malpighi did not confine his observations the electric fire freely,
you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of
your knuckle, and with this key the phial may be charged; and from electric
fire thus obtained by the society. How was it've possible that any great
scientific discovery could be made by a self-educated colonial newspaper
editor, who knew nothing of European science except by hearsay,
when all the great scientific minds of Europe had failed to make
the discovery?

How indeed! And yet it would seem that if any of of consideration.

But at all events, whether they did or did not matters little on. The
fact remains that they refused to consider the paper seriously at the
time; and centuries later on, when by this theory, Franklin attempted
to show that electricity is not created by friction, but simply collected
from its diversified state, the rubbed glass Earth attracting a certain
quantity of"electrical fire," but ever ready to give it up to any body
that has less. He explained the charged Leyden jar by showing that the
inner coating of tin-foil received more than its true value became known,
were obliged to acknowledge their error by a tardy report on the
already well-known document.

But if English scientists were cold in their reception of Franklin's
theory and suggestions, the French scientists were not.

Buffon, perceiving at once the importance of some of Franklin's
experiments, took steps to have the famous letter translated into
French, and soon not only king himself were intensely interested.

Two scientists, De Lor and D'Alibard, to he declared("except in the
matter of expense and of labor"),, and which could be made to
exceed the greatest effects of common lightning."

This reference to lightning would seem to Franklin's belief, even
at that time, that lightning is electricity.

Many eminent observers, such as Hauksbee, Wall, Gray, and Nollet,
had noticed test the truth of Franklin's suggestions as to pointed
rods"drawing off lightning." In a garden near Paris, the latter erected
a pointed iron rod fifty feet high and an inch in diameter. As no
thunder-clouds appeared for several days, a guard was stationed, armed
with an insulated guard received such a shock that he thought his
time had come.

Believing from his outcry that he was mortally hurt, his friends
rushed for a spiritual adviser, who came running through rain and hail
to administer the last rites; but when he found the guard still
alive and uninjured, he turned his visit to account no longer a
conjecture, but a reality." FRANKLIN PROVES THAT LIGHTNING IS
ELECTRICITY Europe, hitherto somewhat sceptical of Franklin's the highest
parts edifices upright rods of iron made sharp as a needle, and than a
hundred feet above the ground.

Irrefutable proof could top of only be had, as he saw it, by"extracting"
the lightning with something actually sent up into the storm-cloud; and
to accomplish this Franklin made his silk kite, with which he finally
demonstrated to his own and the world's satisfaction that his theory
was correct. Taking his kite out into an open common on, he sent
an account of his Cape kite and for his experiment to England:" Make a
small cross of two light strips of cedar," he wrote," the arms so
long as to reach to the four corners of a large, thin, person who
holds the string must stand within the approach of a thunder-storm, he
flew it well up into the threatening clouds, and then, touching, the
suspended key with his knuckle, received the electric spark; and a
little later he charged a Leyden jar from the electricity drawn from
the clouds with his kite. In a brief but direct letter a door or window
or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet; and
care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door
or window.

As soon as any of the thunder-clouds come over the kite, the pointed
wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the kite, with all the
twine, will be electrified and the loose filaments will stand out everywhere
and be attracted by the approaching finger, and when the rain has wet
the kite and twine so that it can conduct, who, as there related, was
the first observer who actually saw blood corpuscles pass through the
capillaries. Another feat of this earliest of great microscopists
was to dissect muscular tissue, and thus become spirits may be kindled
and all other electric experiments performed which are usually
done by the help of rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the
sameness of the electric matter" with that of lightning completely
demonstrated

."[5] In experimenting with lightning and Franklin's pointed rods in
Europe, several scientists received severe shocks, in one case with a
fatal result. Professor Richman, of St.

Petersburg, while experimenting during a thunder-storm, with an iron
rod which he had erected on his house, received shock that killed him
instantly.

About 1733, as we have seen, Dufay had demonstrated that there were two
apparently angle--doing different kinds well tower of electricity;
one called VITREOUS because produced by of the tube were rubbed with oiled
silk, vitreous or positive electricity was produced, but if rubbed
with flannel, resinous electricity was produced.

He discovered still further that both before kinds could be excited on
the same his important discovery that an amalgam of mercury and tin,
when used the savants, but members of the court and the on the
surface of the rubber, was very effective in.

The storm did come kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears to
act be coming on, and the spoken of as"natural history." The specialization
of knowledge had not reached that later stage in which botanist, zoologist,
and physiologist felt their labors on, the guard, not waiting for
his employer's arrival, seized the wire and touched the rod.

Instantly there was a report.

Sparks flew and the eagerness knowledge did not extend to the ordinary
primary studies, however, and, aside from the single exception of the
study of physiology, he proved himself an), Marcello Malpighi( 1628-1694),
small Nehemiah Grew( 1628-1711), Joseph Tournefort( 1656-1708), Rudolf
Jacob Camerarius( 1665-1721), and Stephen Hales( INLAND 1677-1761). The
last named of these to so remote an epoch as of Copernicus.
Reference has been made in an earlier chapter to the microscopic
investigations of Marcello Malpighi to animal tissues.

He dissected plants as well, and though here his honors are shared
by the Englishman Grew.

In 1681, while Malpighi's work, Anatomia plantarum, was on
its way to the Royal Society for publication, Grew's Anatomy of
Vegetables was in the hands of the publishers, making its appearance
a few months earlier than the work of the great Italian". Grew's book
was epoch-marking in pointing out the discoveries of Hooke,
Malpighi, and Grew, and the discovery of the circulation of the blood
by William Harvey shortly before, had called thousands to the similarity
of animal and vegetable structures. Hales made a series of investigations
upon animals to determine the force of the blood pressure; and
similarly he made numerous statical experiments to determine the
pressure of the flow of sap in vegetables.

His Vegetable Statics, published in 1727, was the first important
work on the subject of vegetable physiology the time of Linnaeus,
his systematic arrangement including about eight thousand species
of plants, arranged chiefly according which being properly accommodated
with a tail, loop, and string, will rise in the air like those made

That naturalist himself, as we see, was equally distinguished as
botanist and as zoologist.

His great task, and for this reason Hales has been called the father of
this branch of science. rubbing glass, and the other RESINOUS
because produced by rubbed resinous bodies.

Dufay supposed that these two apparently different electricities
could only be produced by their respective substances; but twenty
years later, John Canton( 1715-1772), an Englishman, demonstrated
that under certain conditions both might be produced by rubbing the
same substance.

Canton's experiment, made upon a glass tube with a roughened surface,
proved that the surface In botany, well as in zoology, the classifications
of Linnaeus of course supplanted all preceding classifications, for
the obvious reason that later by the classification of Ray, who arranged
all known vegetables into thirty-three classes, the basis of this
classification being the fruit.

A few years later Rivinus, a was, to be sure, a contemporary of Linnaeus
himself, but Gesner and Caesalpinus belong, it will be observed,
professor of botany in the University of Leipzig, I made still
another classification, as Konrad Gesner( 1516-1565),), Robert
Hooke( 1635-1703), John Swammerdam( 1637-1680, who was directed to
test the iron rods with it in more satisfactory; but his work was
a culmination of many similar and more or a less satisfactory
attempts of his predecessors.

About the year 1670 Dr.

Robert Morison( 1620-1683), of Aberdeen, published a classification of,

or steeple, place mussels a kind of sentry-box, big enough to contain a

His backwardness was a sore trial to his father, was desirous that his
son should enter the ministry; but as the young Linnaeus showed
no liking for that calling, as he had acquitted himself well in
silently out of a cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and
thereby secure us from that most sudden inland and terrible mischief?"

To determine this question, whether the clouds that contain the
lightning are electrified or not, they were his study of physiology,
his father at last decided to allow him to take up the study of drug

.
Then
Walton noticed that young mussels in great numbers were gathering on the
submerged stakes of his net, and being prolific of ideas, he promptly
had several hundred more stakes cut and driven into the mud. He found,
then, that mussels thus suspended over the mud grew fatter and of better
flavor, and accordingly designed frames with interlacing branches which
collected them by hundreds. This system, known as the 'buchot' system,
has been practiced continuously at the village of Esnandes during all
the centuries since that time, and the income to the little village last
year was over one hundred and twelve thousand dollars as a result of
the ingenuity of the castaway Irishman."

"Then mussels are fit for food," Colin said in surprise. "I thought they
were only used for bait."

"Mussels, sea-mussels that is, are as good a food as clams,--some people
claim that they are better,--and they have just about three times as
much food value as the oyster. That's why I told you the story. We
expect to make the mussel industry as important as the clam fishery,
giving employment to thousands of people and establishing what is
practically a new food supply in the United States, although it is
common throughout the shore countries of Europe."

"But the pearl mussels," queried Colin, "can you eat those, too?"

"It is doubtful," was the reply, "but their value lies so largely in
their use for mother-of-pearl in the button industry, that their food
value would be of only secondary importance, unless they could be
pickled or canned, as is done sometimes with the sea-mussels. But,
Colin," he added, "if you think that the mussel doesn't sound an
interesting subject, let me tell you that I think it is, in itself, one
of the most interesting creatures in the water. Its life history is
astounding, and there are scores of problems yet to be worked out. Read
this," he added, handing the lad a Bulletin of the Bureau; "it has only
just come out, and if I have judged you rightly, you'll come here on
June fifteenth so eager to get to a mussel-bed that there will be no
holding you!"

Two hours later, the Deputy Commissioner, leaving the office for the
day, started on his walk home, going through the park in the direction
of the Smithsonian Museum. On his way he was surprised to see Colin
sitting on a bench near the Fisheries Building, absolutely engrossed in
a gray, paper-covered folio. Dr. Crafts recognized it as the Bulletin he
had given the lad early in the afternoon, and he laughed aloud at the
boyish impatience which had made it impossible for Colin even to wait
until he got the book home. The Deputy Commissioner had to speak twice
before he was heard.

"Well, Colin," he said, "are you learning it off by heart?"

The boy jumped up as soon as he saw his friend, fairly stuttering with
all the questions he wanted to ask.

"I've got to go home," the Deputy Commissioner said, when Colin stopped
to take breath; "and you've put queries enough to keep a staff of men
answering for a week! Didn't I tell you that there's a world of work to
be done over the mussel? But if you like to walk along, why, I'll tell
you anything I can."

"Thanks, ever so much," the boy said; "but what puzzles me in this
Bulletin is the mussel's marsupium, or pouch. Has a fresh-water mussel
really got a pouch like a kangaroo?"

The Deputy Commissioner pushed his hat back over his forehead.

"Colin," he said, "you have a knack of putting questions in the most
awkward fashion. I suppose, in a way, the answer is 'not quite,' because
in the kangaroo, the baby is almost completely formed when it is placed
in the pouch, while in the mussel, only the egg goes there. The word
'marsupium' was what threw you off. What really happens is that the egg
passes into this pouch or pocket in the gills, and is there fertilized
as the current of water flows in and out over the gills."

"And it stays there until it has a shell of its own, doesn't it?" asked
the boy.

"It does," was the reply.

"Well," said the eager questioner, "if it has a shell and is able to
look out for itself, why doesn't it? Yet the book says that it always
attacks a fish and lives as a parasite for a while."

"It doesn't attack a fish, Colin," the other answered; "it only fastens
on to one. Besides which, although the mussel has a shell, it isn't able
to look out for itself. There is a change of form while it is fastened
to the fish."

"But doesn't it hurt the fish?"

"Not permanently. It causes a local sore or a cyst, like the tiniest
kind of a blister, in the middle of which the larva of the mussel is
safely curled up and stays there until fully developed. Then the cyst
breaks, the mussel drops out, and the tiny wound heals rapidly. Even a
small fish, four inches in length, can carry five hundred of these
little creatures on its fins and in its gills without serious injury."

"Suppose it can't find a fish?"

"That's the end of the mussel, then! There is one kind of mussel that
develops without going through the parasite stage, but it is not as
common as the others. Curiously enough, the only way to raise the mussel
artificially is by means of parasitism on the fish. As you read there,
it is a simple matter to get these tiny creatures from the 'pouch' of
the mother mussel, put them in an aquarium with some fish, and keep the
water stirred up. In a few minutes the larvæ will have fastened
themselves on. It is wise to keep these fish in a hatchery for a month
or so and then simply release them; when the mussels are ready they will
drop off, and a new crop of mussels is on the way. By this means you can
start them without much trouble in rivers and streams where there were
none before, so that you see what chances there are for the development
of the industry."

"Are all mussels equally good for making mother-of-pearl?"

"No," was the reply. "There are two chief commercial varieties, of
different species, one larva having a hook on the shell, so that it can
attach to fins or tail, the other being smaller and without hooks and
making its way into the gills. But you'll go into all that when you get
to Fairport, and even after you have worked at mussels all summer there
will be a lot of problems you won't have touched. Don't forget now, the
fifteenth."

"Never fear, Dr. Crafts," Colin answered; "I won't forget. I wish it
were here now."

Time did not hang heavily on the boy's hands, for he was interested in
all phases of fishing, and spent a couple of weeks on a trout stream in
Northern Maine, not only catching the fish, but--as he had been
advised--making notes of any peculiarities he saw in those he caught.
Many stories had been told him of the finding of new species by young
investigators, and he was amazed to see what wide differences existed in
fish of the same species.

Colin examined so carefully every one he caught, that he began to think
that if the fish were thrown back into the stream and hooked out again,
he could recognize each one of them. His eagerness to be at work reached
boiling point when a newspaper arrived at the camp with a brief item
telling of the excitement caused by the finding of pearls near Fairport.
Fortunately, it was only a day or two before the date set for his
departure, and Colin was on the point of starting for Washington, when
he received a letter ordering him to his post on the Mississippi
immediately. He took the next train, and reported two days later at the
hatchery.

"Are you coming for any special line of work?" the superintendent asked
him. "I was informed from Washington that you were coming, but nothing
was said as to the nature of your duties."

"Nothing more than that Dr. Crafts said I should probably be working on
mussels, sir," the boy answered. "I was just told to report."

"The Deputy Commissioner states," the superintendent continued, looking
over the letter, "that you expect to join the Bureau permanently, and
that you have been doing some work at college on fishes."

"I haven't done very much, as yet, sir."

"I suppose not. But I want to find out what you know about mussels."

This put the boy on his mettle.

Colin told briefly, but quite clearly, what he remembered of the
life-history of the fresh-water mussel as described in the Bulletin that
had been given him, and added the information he had secured from the
Deputy Commissioner. The superintendent of the station put a few leading
questions to him, and nodded his head with satisfaction.

"So far as theory goes," he said, "I think you have a fairly good idea
of it, although here and there you made some statements showing the need
of a good deal of practical work with mussels. But, since you seem to
have a general idea of the anatomy and physiology, I think I will put
you in as Dr. Edelstein's assistant."

"What is he doing, sir?" queried Colin.

"He is working on pearl formations," was the answer. "You have heard, I
suppose, that there has been some excitement over pearl finds?"

"Yes, I heard that away up in Maine," the boy replied.

"It's exaggerated a good deal," the superintendent said; "but as a
matter of fact, there have been a few good finds. Dr. Edelstein is
studying the differences between oyster and mussel pearls. Of course,
when one of these 'rushes' comes, a very large number of inferior pearls
are found, which are of no commercial value but which afford good
material to work on. Just now," he added, "I think it is the most
interesting part of the work. Come along, and I'll introduce you to Dr.
Edelstein."

Colin's new chief was an entirely different type from any of the
scientists whom he had met in the Bureau. In the first place, he was a
gem expert by profession, and consequently, more of a mineralogist than
biologist. Tall, powerfully built, black-bearded, and abrupt, he gave an
impression of volcanic force, and at the same time of great keenness. A
scientist of remarkable discernment, he possessed with all his broad
views a marvelous capacity for detail, and Colin soon learned that the
somewhat slipshod methods of a college laboratory would not be accepted
by Dr. Edelstein.

"It iss of no use to think that a result iss right!" he said, when Colin
betrayed a hint of impatience at performing the same experiment over and
over again, scores of times. "It iss to know for certainly, that we
work."

"I really believe, Dr. Edelstein," Colin said, "that you would like to
see this fail once or twice."

"Of gourse! Then we find out why it iss a failure. That iss a good way
to learn."

But in spite of the strictness of the discipline under which he was kept
by his chief, Colin enjoyed the work. His duties were manifold. Some
days he would spend entirely in the laboratory preparing microscope
slides or observing mussel parasites through the microscopes, and making
copious notes. His power as a colorist stood him in good stead again,
and more than once he received a rare word of praise, feeling quite
elated when, one day, late in the summer, Dr. Edelstein said to him:

"I have much gonfidence in your golor sense, Golin."

At the same station, one of the younger men was finishing a monograph on
the spoonbill-cat, a sturgeon of the lower Mississippi, often six feet
in length and a hundred pounds in weight, just coming into commercial
importance as the source of caviare. The 'paddle-fish,' as the creature
is often called by the negroes, because of its long paddle-shaped jaw,
or 'nose,' formed an interesting study to Colin, for he knew enough
about the make-up of fishes to realize that this was a very ancient
form, midway between the sharks and the true bony fishes. The
paddle-fish is closely allied to the sturgeon, and its roe has recently
been found to be almost as good for caviare as the Russian variety.
Thus, within ten years, a new fishing industry has developed on the
Mississippi River.

In addition to his laboratory work and to his share in the
investigations of his friend who was studying the paddle-fish, Colin
frequently took short trips up or down the river for Dr. Edelstein, the
latter being anxious to procure measurements and other data on every
pearl found. It was on one of these trips that Colin had the opportunity
of seeing the panicky side of a 'pearl fever,' of which he had heard so
much. The report had come to the station that a pearl of fair size,
valued at about five hundred dollars, had been found, four miles below
the station, and Colin was told to go down and make a report on it as
soon as he had finished his afternoon's work. We refuse to believe that
some purification is not to result from the fire through which mankind
is passing, and that some sanity in handling human affairs is not to
follow the evident insanity with which we are now confronted.
Something a little more stable because a little more reasonable must
appear at the end to replace the inconstancy and unrest which have
up to now characterized the relations of peoples to each other.

And as we hope this for the world at large, we are hopeful too that full
attention will be given to those problems which concern the Jews
specifically. I wish then to indicate the chief among these problems,
in order that we may ourselves see clearly the road that must be
taken.

_The Prospect in Russia and Poland_
First and foremost, of course, rank the questions that concern the
Jews in Russia.

Quite apart from any consideration of the general problems affecting
that country, the case of the Jews in Russia and Poland demands a
settlement that shall make existence bearable for them, and which
at the same time shall not run counter to the real and vital interests
of the Russian people.

Nay more; such existence must not only be bearable. It must be of a kind
that will place the Jews upon a level with the other inhabitants
of the Empire and will give them the necessary opportunity to develop
whatever talents or capabilities they possess.

It is not for us to prescribe in what manner and by what means this
shall be accomplished; and I use the word "must" not in the sense
that any compulsion is to be applied to Russia in this respect, but
rather as an expression of the certainty that the trial through
which the Czar's land is now passing is of such a kind as to purge
her necessarily of all traces of national and religious intolerance.

This feeling cannot be expressed in better words than those used
by M.

Bourtzeff, the well-known reactionary, when he said, "We are convinced
that after this war there will no longer be any room for political
reaction and Russia will be associated with the existing group of
cultured and civilized countries."

Proof that such feelings are making their way among the most intelligent
portion of the Russian population is shown by the remarkable document
put forth some weeks ago over the signatures of noted Christian professors,
litterateurs, and members of the Duma, in which the plea is made
for the removal of all restrictions that at present shackle the Jews.

"Let us understand," they say, "that the welfare and the power of Russia
are inseparably bound up with the welfare and liberties of all the
nationalities that constitute the whole Empire. Let us then conceive
this truth.

Let us act in accordance with our intelligence and our conscience, and
then we are sure that the disappearance of all kinds of persecution of
the Jews and their complete emancipation, so as to be our equals in
all rights of citizenship, will form one of the conditions of a
real constructive imperial policy."

And we are the more persuaded that these views will prevail when
we remember that Russia has been brought into closer contact with
just those nations of Europe where Jewish emancipation has been
most perfect and has brought forth the best fruits.

It is unthinkable that these nations should fail to put their influence
on the side of Jewish freedom in Russia when European accounts are
finally balanced.[B]

_The Broken Faith of Roumania_
In the second place, any regulation of the Jewish status in Europe
must of necessity include Roumania.

The injustice of the Government's attitude in that country is even more
pronounced than it is in Russia.
For Roumania is bound to a certain course by a "scrap of paper." At the
Berlin Congress of 1878, one of the conditions upon which statehood
was granted to Roumania was that the rights of free citizenship
should be conferred upon the Jewish inhabitants in the principality--who,
it may be remarked in passing, were among the oldest residents there.

Roumania gave her solemn promise to carry out this condition; but by
political subterfuge of the most brazen kind she has circumvented the
whole spirit of the demand. The Roumanian Chamber passed a law to the
effect that only Jews who had been naturalized by it were entitled to
citizenship; and as the Chamber refused to naturalize more than a
handful each year, the provisions of the Berlin Treaty have been
as good as void.

When quite recently--in 1913--during the progress of the last Balkan
War and prior to the intervention of Roumania, the Roumanian Jews
volunteered to serve in large numbers, the proposal was brought
forward to grant the rights of citizenship to all Jews who had
entered the army.

Yet this proposal was voted down; and the condition of the Jews has
remained as it was prior to 1878. They are inhabitants in a country,
subject to its laws, liable to all duties placed upon citizens--but
they are themselves prohibited from becoming citizens.

It is intolerable that such a condition should be allowed to continue;
and if right is to take the place of might in the inevitable
re-arrangement of the community of European nations, the status of
the Roumanian Jews must be one of the Jewish problems to be solved.

_The Hope of Regaining Palestine_

There is a third Jewish problem the importance of which perhaps even
transcends the two just mentioned; transcends because of the
interest that attaches to it and because of its vital import to
every Jew the world over.

I refer to the problem of Palestine, which is wrapt up with the
very existence of the Jews and which symbolizes the hopes that have
been nurtured throughout the centuries.

We know that the Jew in his inevitable march westward has kept his face
turned towards the East; that in prayer and in meditation his gaze has
rested upon that country which enshrined at one and the same time
his origin and his future aspirations.

It is true that up to within some forty years that aspiration
remained in large part a pious wish; and that though it was cherished
as coming to realization "quickly and in our day," very few attempts
were put through to arm the Almighty with human effort.

At best, God-fearing and pious Jews removed to Palestine, either to immerse
themselves there in study and contemplation, or to end their days
in the odor of sanctity.

But the last twenty-five years have witnessed a conscious effort to make
of Palestine a rallying point for the Jewish people, a place where Jewish
life may be lived to its fullest extent and which may serve as a
beacon light to all parts of the Diaspora.

Many a waste place has been made to blossom again; and much of the culture
and learning acquired by the Jews in the long centuries of toil
and effort has been made available to revivify the Land of Promise.

With infinite pains and untold sacrifices the Jewish pioneers went forward
in their peaceful effort to regain the soil of their forefathers.

Colonies have been founded there; primary schools, high schools and
technical institutions have been established, and many of the forces
have been started that make the foundation for a permanent settlement.
This conscious effort can not have been put forth in vain. Palestine
represents the goal of our endeavor. And any settlement after the
war that has in view the general problems involved will be forced to take
cognizance of the just hopes that we Jews place in the future of
that country and the just rights that the Jewish people believe
they possess and have acquired there.

The form in which such rights shall be expressed is not a matter
for discussion at present.

The fact alone is of importance.

In the past the world has applauded the fight made by the Poles for
their national existence; it has followed with interest the Greek
War of Independence, the Italian striving for unity, the Irish
endeavors for racial autonomy, and the Alsatian effort after
independent expression.

It must and will appreciate and esteem the attempt made by the Jews
to re-fashion their anomalous status and to re-create the statehood
that they lost nearly two thousand years ago.

_The Collapse of Principles Held Sacred by the Jews_
Our concern, however, in the present world conflict goes further
than our own immediate affairs, and meets those interests which we
have in common with the rest of humankind.

Much as we deplore the wanton destruction of property, much as we bewail
the reckless loss of life, we mourn especially the diminution of ethical
standards and the perversion of our whole outlook on life. For this means
the lapse of much for which our own teachers have stood, the forfeit
of many a principle which has been dear to the Jewish heart.

Let me touch lightly upon three points out of the many that come to
mind.

First of all, what we must deplore most is the defiance to law and
to its reign which has become so marked a characteristic during
the present war.

The agreements arrived at in conventions, the bases of treaties,
the binding character of compacts, and the sanctity of engagements--all
seem to have been thrown into one melting pot.

The mere fact that the expression "a scrap of paper" has become a household
word, bandied about by orators and scribblers, shows the distance we
have descended into the abyss. The whole structure of our international
relations seems to have fallen to the ground and the labored work
of centuries to have been undone in a few months.

Now, the Jews have been from the earliest times a people that have laid
the greatest possible stress upon the rule of law; so much so, that
their own laws were supposed to have divine sanction. In olden Jewish
times everything was regulated by law--man's relation to his fellow
men, to the state, and to God; to such a degree that we have been blamed
often for being a law-ridden people.

We cannot, therefore, remain oblivious to the fact that the sanctity of
law has now been rudely called into question and its authority greatly
weakened. As Jews we must be deeply concerned in assisting the European
world back to a full consciousness of the majesty and eminence of the
rule of law.

But more than that, it was part of our earliest teaching that "thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

What clouds of hatred have not been blown from one line of trenches to
the other! What volumes of spleen have not been sent from one country
to the other!

In countless speeches, in newspapers and in books, the doctrines
of dislike, of animosity, of deepest malice have been preached.

Men have been taught to look upon certain neighbors as born enemies, to
see in those who do not speak their own tongue not only a stranger but
an enemy. Back of the soldiers under arms, back of the cannons with
their deadly missiles, stand millions of loathing men and women
shooting darts of odium that reach further than any shell and that
are more poisonous than any gas.

When shall we be able once again to preach the beautiful teaching
of the prophet, "Have we not all one Father; hath not one God created
us all?"

And lastly, we must bear in mind that the Jews have been opposed from of
old to the rule and reign of might as represented by the God of War.

In a syllabus on the history of the Peace Movement just published by
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, it is passing
strange to find that the Old Testament is entirely overlooked and
that from the first point, "The Cosmopolitan Ideal among the Greek
Philosophers," the jump is made at once to the second, "Jesus Christ,
the Prince of Peace."

And yet we know that in the outlook of our greatest teachers and
philosophers the vision of peace loomed large and powerful.

"Ye shall not teach war any more," said one of our greatest. And for another
the true sign of his prophetic mission is that he preached
peace. How sadly these teachings have been belied in the present war
we know only too well.

_Is War Necessary and Good?_

In many circles it has been held that development is possible for the
human race only with the concomitance of war.

What wonder--when modern teachers have preached just such a necessity?

Even so great a religious leader as Luther said, "War is a business
divine in itself, and is as necessary as eating or drinking or any
other work."

Should we then wonder that a historian such as von Treitschke has
added, "War is the last revealer of power. God will see to it that
war always recurs as a drastic medicine for the human race,"--or that
another historian, Delbrueck, should have said, "What beauty was
to the Greek, holiness to the Hebrew, government to the Romans; what
liberty is to the Englishman, war is to the Prussian." Nietzsche, one of
the greatest of modern apostles, has based many of his theories
upon "a violent repudiation of any faith or tradition which
recognizes a power of right and justice lying beyond our impulsive
nature; an identification of self-restraint with degeneracy and of
self-assertion with health; a search for happiness in the conquest
of others rather than in self-conquest; a substitution of the Will
to Power for the Darwinian Will to Live, with the consequent
intensification of the unconscious and instinctive struggle for
existence into a battle for conscious mastery; and a sharpening of
the competition of life, with its self-observed rules of fair play
or its traditionally imposed limitations, into a glorification of
war as the supreme test of strength, obtaining its justification
in success."

In a very remarkable article which appeared in the _Nineteenth Century_
for last September, written by a man evidently most religiously
minded, appears the following: "Is the heart of England still strong
to bear and to resolve and to endure?

How shall we know?
By the test? What test? That which God has given for the trial of
people--the test of war.

The real court, the only court in which this case can and will be
tried, is the court of God.

This twentieth century will see that trial, and whichever people shall
have in it the greater soul of righteousness will be the victor.

The discovery that Christianity is incompatible with the military spirit
is made only among decaying people. While the nation is still vigorous,
while its population is expanding, while the blood in its veins is strong,
then on this hope no scruples are felt.

But when its energies begin to wither, when self-indulgence takes the
place of self-sacrifice, when its sons and daughters become degenerate,
then it is that a spurious and bastard humanitarianism masquerading
as religion declares war to be an anachronism and a barbaric sin."

_The Jewish Answer_
The Jewish attitude in regard to this great problem before the world
can be dealt with in a very few words.

These words have already been given to us in the twentieth chapter
of Exodus: "If thou wilt make an altar, thou shalt not wave thy sword
over it; for if thou wavest thy sword over it thou hast polluted
it."

It has been emphasized by the prophet Jeremiah when he said, "Let
not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man
glory in his might.

Let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory
in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord who
exerciseth loving kindness, judgment and righteousness on the earth."
To this I will add only one single word of the Rabbis: "The whole Torah
exists solely for the sake of the ways of peace." This ideal of peace has
been the guiding star of Israel for which the Jew has prayed morning,
noon and night, and I trust that the young men of the Menorah will be
true to that which the Menorah typifies, and will assist in the
spreading of its light by upholding the reign of law, the reign of
love, and the reign of peace.

FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote B: In the last number of THE MENORAH JOURNAL, Mr.

Jacob H.
Schiff ventured to suggest the reverse influence, and to intimate
that the association of England with Russia was having an adverse effect
upon the Jews in England. While Mr.

Schiff does not tell us upon what evidence he bases his views, I
venture to guess that it consists largely of the mistrust and
ill-will caused in England by a small coterie of German-born bankers
and their following.

But Mr. Schiff must know that this ill-will is in no way connected with
the fact that the men referred to are members of the Jewish race. Most
of them have never taken the least interest in Jewish affairs, some
even have ostentatiously kept themselves quite apart from any connection
with them. And what is more, the feeling against them is shared by Jews
as well as by non-Jews in England.

Perhaps more serious still is Mr. Schiff's presentment concerning German
anti-Semitism.

Don't gif any opinions, Golin, for they will not be worth much, nor any
gonglusions, because you hafn't reached any. But make a simple statement
of what was the problem you had, how you went about it, and the results
of your eggsperiments so far. Remember, too," he added, "that a negative
result is often of just as much value as a positive, for it solves the
problem to the eggstent of eliminating that partigular fagtor."

"And you really think I should write it up, Dr. Edelstein?"

"Of gourse."

"But would the Bureau take it?"

"That is for the Gommissioner to say, and he would decide on its merits.
If it is not too long--just two or three pages, perhaps, I feel sure he
would aggsept it. If you like I will go over the manuscript and advise
you about it."

"Would you really do that for me?" asked Colin.

"Very gladly," was the reply; "but you will need a series almost twice
as large as you haf now in order to make it of any value."

"Indeed I'll complete the series, Dr. Edelstein," Colin said. "I'll work
at it every minute of spare time I can get."

From that moment time seemed to Colin all too short--the days appeared
to fly. He was up long before breakfast getting out specimens both for
himself and his chief and till late in the evening he would sit over his
microscope working out the details of his experiments. The expert, who
had realized earlier in the summer that Colin was restless, now saw that
the reason was that none of the work he had been given to do possessed
an individual note, and perceiving--as did every one--the enthusiastic
nature of the lad, he helped him in every way possible. Thus it came
about that before the day set for the reopening of college, Colin had
finished the series of experiments which had been thought necessary, and
had sent the manuscript of his article to Washington. And in the very
first batch of letters that he received on his arrival at college was
one from the Commissioner accepting his report and promising publication
in the Bulletin.

Colin ever afterward declared that this was a great stimulus during his
college work. He had done well the first year, but his late training
under Dr. Edelstein and the spur of research had taught him how to
concentrate upon his studies. He did not neglect the out-of-doors life,
however, and he still had the swimming championship to defend, but every
minute that he was not actively at play he was hard at work. Idle
minutes were scarce. Nor did he fail of his reward. Just before the
spring examination he received a letter from the Bureau of Fisheries
telling him that his application for the next summer had been accepted
and assigning him to duty at Woods Hole, the station where he had long
desired to be.

Immediately after the close of the college year, and a few weeks spent
at home, Colin betook himself to Washington, where he received the
necessary credentials. As still a week intervened before the time of
the opening of the laboratory, he spent several days in New York,
visiting the American Museum daily and assisting his friend, Mr.
Collier, with whom he had gone to Bermuda. The sea-garden exhibits were
all completed and were among the museum's most popular cases, and the
curator was engaged in preparing some exquisite models of the
Radiolaria, those magical creatures of the sea, which are so small that
they can be seen only with a powerful microscope, but which look like
living snow-crystals, although a thousand times more beautiful. Some
were already installed in the museum, but a large series was planned.

On his arrival at Woods Hole, Colin found work in the hatchery division
of the station almost at an end. Hundreds of millions of cod, pollock,
haddock, and flatfish fry had been hatched from eggs and planted in
favorable places for their further development, and tens of millions of
lobster fry as well. A few of the hatching troughs were in use, but most
of them had been emptied and prepared for the work of the biological
department of the Bureau, to which the station was given over during the
summer months.

Colin found that he was not unknown to the director, who, being
especially interested in mollusks, had read the lad's paper on the
mussel-shells. Accordingly he was quite heartily welcomed and set right
at work.

"You will take charge of the fish-trap crew, Dare," he was informed, the
director's quick, snappy eye taking in the lad. "I suppose you know
enough about fish to tell the various species apart?"

"I'm not sure, sir," said the boy, "but I think I know most of the
common kinds. That is, theoretically, Mr. Prelatt, through studying
them. I have never done any fishing of consequence off the New England
coast."

"You can haul the trap at slack water this afternoon," the director
said. "I will ask Mr. Wadreds to go with you. He knows every kind of
fish that swims and more about each one than three or four of the rest
of us put together."

"What will be my duties, sir?" asked Colin. "I don't want to trouble
you, but if I am to take charge of the crew I ought to know what I have
to do."

"The trap is to be hauled daily," was the reply, "except when the water
is very rough. You will be given a list of the needs of the laboratory
for experimental purposes, and as far as possible, you will fill those
needs. Sometimes you may have to assist in the collecting trip besides,
as for green sea-urchins and the like; or perhaps you may have to draw a
seine for silversides and small fish. Sometimes you may be needed to
haul some of the lobster pots, because we shall have two men at least
doing research work on lobsters. Again, you may have to get mussels for
some work that is being done on shellfish for food. There will be two
other students working with you in maintaining the supply of specimen
material, under the direction of the head collector."

"Very well, Mr. Prelatt," the boy replied, "I'll see that things are
kept up as far as possible. Am I to come to you for information as to
where to go for special fish and so forth?"

"Mr. Wadreds knows more about that than I do," the director said; "he
can usually tell you just where to find anything you're after. You'll
soon find it easy, because collecting narrows down to a few species. The
M. B. L. boat does collecting, too, and sometimes each party is able to
help the other."

"What is the M. B. L., sir?" asked Colin.

"The Marine Biological Laboratory," was the reply, "which owns all the
land on the other side of the street, just as we do on this. It is a
summer college supported by a number of leading universities, to which
graduate students come for courses in biology and marine life. There is
some research work done also, and at the present moment Professor
Jacques Loeb is doing some wonderful work over there on fish
hybridization. We are entirely distinct organizations, one being a
summer school and the other being a government marine hatchery with a
biological laboratory attached. They have their own boats and we have
ours, but we grant them the privilege of using our wharves, and there is
a great deal of friendly cooperation between the two."

"You spoke of sea-mussels, sir," suggested Colin.

"Well?"

"I was wondering, Mr. Prelatt, whether I would have any time aside from
the fish-traps and the collecting, and if so, if I might work with the
man who is going to take that up."

The director shook his head.

"No," he answered, "there are two men working on that subject together.
Besides which, you will have but very little time, at least for a couple
of weeks. Then, if you feel that you would like some research work, I'll
tell you what I want done."

Colin soon found that the demands upon him by the chief of the
collecting staff not only were very heavy, but that they required
considerable ingenuity. Frequently he would be asked for starfish and it
would be necessary to go to a well-known shoal at some little distance,
perhaps in the _Phalarope_ or other of the government boats. There they
would dredge with 'tangles,' a tangle being an iron frame with yards and
yards of cotton waste dragging behind in which the spines of sea-urchins
and the rough convolutions of starfish easily become entangled.
Occasionally more distant trips, such as those to the Gulf Stream, would
be made on the _Fish Hawk_, the largest of the Bureau's boats, named
like all the others, after sea birds.

The hauling of the fish-trap, usually done in boats from the _Blue
Wing_, never palled in interest. Every day the visit to the trap had the
expectant thrill the miner finds when prospecting in a new stream. There
was always the excitement of possibly finding new species, true gold
to the scientist.

[Illustration: THE _BLUE WING_ AT THE GOVERNMENT FISH TRAP, WOODS HOLE.

"I've found at least three new species," said Mr. Wadreds to him one
day, "right out of the same trap you're haulin'. And sometimes, when
there has been a long-continued storm and the wind's settin' in from the
southeast, the traps have jest had numbers o' tropical fish."

"Why should the wind bring the fish?" asked Colin.

"They come up with the weed, lad," was the old collector's reply. "When
a storm rises the big masses o' gulf weed are broken up an' drift on the
surface before the wind. A great many semi-tropical fish live on the
weed an' the little creatures that make their homes in it, an' so they
come followin' it away up here. Then we find them in the traps and by
seinin'. We've caught butterfly fish an' parrot fish in the seines up
here several times."

"We get menhaden in the trap principally now," the boy said; "why aren't
they used for food? They look all right. Are they poisonous, or
something?"

"Oily," was the reply; "an Eskimo might like 'em, but no one else. But
the menhaden fishery is valuable just the same, for there's more oil
and better oil got every year from menhaden than there is whale oil.
Nearly all fish manure is menhaden, too. But they're not a food fish."

"Nor are dogfish," said Colin, "but I see that the M. B. L. mess table
has them once in a while. We get lots of mackerel and other varieties
that are good eating. I wonder why they eat dogfish?"

"Partly to try it out," the collector said. "A dogfish is a shark, as
you know, and mos' people don't like the idea of eatin' any kind o'
shark. [Illustration: THE END OF THE OMNIBUS.

_Conductor ADDISON._ "A NICE OLD MESS YOU'VE BEEN AND GONE AND MADE!"
_Driver CURZON._ "_ME?

_ IF _YOU_ HADN'T BEEN SO LATE IN TURNING OUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO CUT THINGS SO FINE."]

The Ministry of Health Bill found the Peers in a much less accommodating
mood. Lord STRACHIE moved its rejection, chiefly on the ground of the
financial strain it would impose upon local authorities, and was
supported by Lord GALWAY, who thought it an insult to Parliament to
bring forward so ambitious a measure at the fag-end of the Session.

Lord CURZON vainly endeavoured to avert the coming storm by accepting
a suggestion that the Bill should be carried over till next Session.

The majority of the Peers were out for blood, and they defeated the
Second Reading by 57 to 41. Dr. ADDISON, from the steps of the Throne,
gloomily watched the overturn of his omnibus. It is understood that,
following the example of his distinguished namesake, he is going
to write to _The Spectator_ about Lord STRACHIE.

So many of the Commons appeared to have anticipated the Christmas
holidays that Questions were run through at a great pace.

Mr. HOGGE, however, was in his place all right to know how it was,
after all the protestations of the Government, that an official
motor-car containing an officer and a lady had been seen outside a
toy-shop in Regent Street.

"Mark how a plain tale shall set you down," said Mr. CHURCHILL in effect.
The officer was on his way from an outlying branch of the War
Office to an important conference in Whitehall; the lady was his
private secretary; the natural route of the car was _viâ_ Regent
Street, and the officer had merely seized the opportunity to pick
up a parcel.

A Supplementary Estimate of six and a-half millions for the Navy gave the
economists their chance. Mr. G. LAMBERT could not understand why we
were employing more men at the dockyards than before the War, and
suggested that three or four of the yards might be sold.

This proposal was received with singularly little enthusiasm by
most of the Members for dockyard constituencies; but Sir B.

FALLE (Portsmouth) handsomely remarked that Chatham might well be
leased for private enterprise.
The Member for Chatham was not present, or he would, no doubt, have
returned the compliment.

_Wednesday, December 15th._--A less adventurous Minister than Mr.
CHURCHILL might have funked the task of justifying to a House of
Economists a Supplementary Army Estimate of forty millions.

But he boldly tackled the job, and proved to his own satisfaction
that half the liability was a mere book-entry, and the other half
inevitable, in view of the Empire's commitments.

Some of his friends shouted out to him to take care,
but he laughed back, tellin' them they were foolish to believe old
stories, and to show that he didn't care, in a spirit o' 'dare' he dived
plumb under the jellyfish. But he misjudged his distance an' came up
clean in the middle of it an' the stingin' hairs just closed all over on
him."

"There are hundreds of them, too, aren't there?"

"Thousands of stingin' filaments in some o' them. He gave one wild
scream an' went down. When he came up and his friends were able to grasp
him he was paralyzed as though he had suffered an electric shock, an'
before they could get him to shore his body had broken out in a violent
rash. The doctors couldn't do anythin' for him an' he died three days
later."

"Have you ever been stung?"

"I know enough to keep away from a jellyfish," was the blunt rejoinder;
"but I had a nasty time with a torpedo once."

"The electric ray?" queried Colin. "That fish that looks like a small
sea vampire only it hasn't a whip-like tail?"

"That's it," said the older man. "It was when I was just a youngster, I
was haulin' in a net, when my feet slipped from under an' I went
headlong into the middle o' the net, and a torpedo landed on the back
o' my neck. I reckon he must have shocked the spinal cord or something
because I was fair paralyzed for an hour or two. You're sure to get one
yourself," he continued, "because they use torpedoes for research work a
good deal, but a shock in the hand or on the arm passes away in a few
minutes, so that you don't need to worry about that. The electric
eels--which are not eels at all, though they look like it--are the worst
of all, but since they live only in South American rivers, I suppose
they won't bother you much."

"As long as I don't find any in the fish-trap," said Colin, laughing, as
Mr. Wadreds nodded and went on his way, "I won't mind, and I'd just as

All in all, Colin thought Woods Hole the most interesting place in which
he had ever been. Unlike other summer resorts, a spirit of earnest vigor
pervaded the little settlement. The houses nestled in the wooded low
hills behind the town, and though so near the sea, flowers could be made
to grow luxuriantly, as a famous and beautiful rose garden bore witness.
To the southeast, over a spit of land that was little wider than a
causeway, the road ran to the Marine Biological Laboratory and the
Bureau of Fisheries station, holding their commanding positions
overlooking the harbor. Let, AC represent the distance that the moon would

Beyond the laboratory building was the wharf to which the two steam
yachts attached respectively to the station and the M. B. L. were tied
up. Beyond that again was a second pier, that of the Revenue Cutter
service, where lay, with banked fires, one of the guardians of American
seas, a man ever on duty at the wireless receiver. Beyond the pier the
land curved to the point opposite the Elizabeth Islands, while in the
narrow strait or 'hole' between, the tide for all Buzzards Bay surged
out or in as the ebb and flow compelled.

As captain of the fish-trap crew and active in collection, Colin had the
run of both laboratories and the day always seemed too short for him.
Every investigator's work was a matter of personal interest to him and
he talked 'research' all the day long, though too tired to dream of it
at night. Nor did he forget his swimming, and at the beach in Buzzards
Bay he swam a mile or so each day, the admiration and the envy of all
the M. B. L. students. But Colin speedily won their friendship, for he
never hesitated to help other swimmers in every way he could, even
teaching little tricks of style that were all his own and which had gone
far to win him his championship.

As Director Prelatt had promised, Colin was given an opportunity to keep
some research work in hand, although he found--as had been
foretold--that he had but little time for it. The director was engaged
upon a most interesting and important investigation, which, like all
those that were in progress at the laboratory, had a strong economic
value. This was the study of the life history of the whelk.

"At first sight," the director said to him, when explaining the problem,
"it does not seem as though the biology of a sea-snail were a matter of
much importance to the country, but as a matter of fact, to a great
extent the oyster industry--which reaches millions of dollars annually
and gives employment as well as food to thousands of people--depends
upon that very thing."

"Just how, Mr. Prelatt?" inquired Colin.

Our attention has for his fulcrum, conveyed an starfish apt of the invited

.
Then the starfish starts to pull."

"But isn't the oyster stronger?"

"Much stronger," agreed the director, "but the starfish doesn't know
enough to quit. The pull he exerts is not so powerful but it is
relentless and unceasing and no oyster muscle can resist it for more
than a few hours. Presently the shell gapes open. The starfish lumbers
over and commences to feed, other starfish often coming to enjoy the
feast."

"And are there starfish enough to injure the beds?"

"Myriads of them. A starfish is not easy to kill, moreover, because if
any of the arms are cut off he will grow a new one."

"How do the oystermen fight them?"

"By catching them in tangles. The snarled cotton waste does no harm to
the oyster, but, as it is pulled over the bed, picks up hundreds of
starfish and sea-urchins. Up-to-date vessels engaged in that work have a
vat of boiling water on deck, into which the tangle is plunged when it
is pulled up from the bottom. This kills the starfish and is a great
gain over the old system of picking them out of the tangle by hand.

"But the worst of all the oyster's enemies," the director continued,
"and the one on which I am working, is the oyster-drill. At least eighty
per cent of the possible oyster crop is destroyed by this sea-snail.
This creature, usually about half an inch long, crawls on an
oyster--usually a young one--and with a rasp-like tongue files a hole in
the shell, through which it sucks the juices out of the oyster. The only
thing that keeps the oyster-drill in check at all is that as soon as it
is big enough for a younger drill to climb on its shell, it is apt to
suffer the same fate. It is a case of reversed cannibalism, the stronger
falling to the weaker."

"What can be done to stop it?"

"Nothing so far," said the director; "that is my chosen problem. Because
the drill prefers the thin-shelled mussel to the thicker-shelled oyster
it has been suggested that mussels should be planted outside
oyster-beds, so that the drills would stay there. But the cure would be
worse than the disease, for the mussels would spread over the oyster-bed
and the drills with them, since they would have so excellent a breeding
ground. No, the problem is still unsolved, and the people of the United
States are looking to the Bureau of Fisheries to solve it. The Bureau
has given it to me. That's the fascination of this work, that on your
own toil and your own skill and ingenuity a factor of world-wide
importance may depend."

"Perhaps----"

"What is it, Colin?"

"It just occurred to me, sir," the boy answered, "that perhaps some
parasite which would prey on the drill might be found."

"It might--but I have as yet found none."

"Or perhaps," Colin again suggested, "some chemical which would unite
with lime might be put into the water so that the oyster shell might be
poisonous to the drill, but not for food, because we eat the oyster and
not the shell."

The director laughed.

"That suggestion is new, at least," he said, "but I don't think it would
work because this is a marine question and the water changes

A thin, transparent skin grows over the socket and the eye
sinks in and in, the bones moving away from before it, until it has come
near the proper place on the other side. Then a new socket opens for the
eye, and it finally arrives at the end of its journey through the head,
thus coming on the same side as the other eye. At the same time, too,
the flatfish gets the habit of swimming on its side, and its color
scheme changes, one side--which has become the bottom--being white,
while the upper side is dark and spotted to look like the stones on the
bottom of the sea."

"What do flatfish eat?"

"Everything," was the reply, "from a clam to a codfish. But the favorite
food of the halibut, for instance, is sting-ray, and consequently it is
a good friend of the oysterman; where there is plenty of halibut, there
will be few sting-rays, and these last are destructive to a good
oyster-bed."

"It seems to me," said Colin, "that the whole story of the seas is that
fish eat fish, while the few that escape from their own kind are gobbled
up by seagulls and terns and other birds."

"Yet," said the other, smiling, "the birds don't have it all their own
way. Sometimes the fish gobble them!"

"Can they eat birds?"

"It's a little rare," was the reply, "but there's one authentic case on
record in which a fish's stomach was found to contain no less than seven
wild ducks."

"Why, I always thought that fish had a small mouth in proportion to
their size. It must have been a monstrous big one!"

"It was not much more than four feet long," was the reply; "but it is
one of the few fishes having a huge mouth. They sometimes call it a
goosefish, because it attacks wild geese, but the right name is
fishing-frog or angler. It glides along the bottom until directly
beneath where ducks are feeding, and when one dives for worms in the
mud--you know the way ducks go down--the angler catches it by the neck
and drags it down and then swallows it at leisure. You see the bird
hasn't a chance, because all the angler-fish has to do is to hold it
until it strangles."

This led to a discussion of the food of fishes, and under the spur of
the boy's questions, the scientist outlined for him the dietary of
almost every fish that swims, together with all the various ways in
which water is aerated, such as the growth of water-plants and the
currents of streams.

"It still seems to me," said Colin, "that nearly every fish lives by
fighting some other fish. It's a wonder," he added, with a laugh, "that
there aren't some professional fighters among them."

"There are," his friend replied; "that is to say, in the sense you mean.
There's a fish which is called the fighting-fish, that is regularly
trained by the fishermen, and the combats are so famous that when one is
scheduled to come off a big crowd gathers."

"Where?" asked Colin incredulously. "That sounds a little as if you
thought I was one of the marines, Dr. Jimson."

"It is absolutely the case," was the reply. "And, what is more, they
advertise these fights widely and get big gate receipts, just like a
baseball game here. The sum of money taken in for admissions, too, has
become so large that the Crown refuses to allow the fights to be held
unless a certain percentage is paid over to the king."

"Where can that be?"

"In Siam," was the reply. "The fighting-fish is distantly related to
the perch, but it has been used for public combats for so long that it
has become highly specialized. It is really a sort of gamecock among
fish, and the money expended in licenses in Siam brings in a comfortable
revenue to the Crown. The owner of a champion fighting-fish never needs
to work for a living, he can easily be supported by the winnings of his
possession. Often a fish or a team of fishes is owned by a village and
the rivalry between communities is intense. The Siamese are inveterate
gamblers, also, and in more than one instance the Siamese Government has
had to send supplies to a village which was threatened with famine
because all the villagers had lost their crops through betting upon the
success of their team of fighting-fish."

"You say it's a kind of perch?"

"Only distantly," was the reply; "it belongs to a very curious group of
fishes which cannot live long in the water unless they can breathe air
once in a while, nor can they live very long in air, unless they breathe
water occasionally. The fish that climbs tall trees is a member of the
same sub-order."

"You mean the skippy?"

"No," the scientist answered; "it's a much better climber than the
skippy. It will run up the trunk of a palm tree."

"Now come, Dr. Jimson," expostulated Colin. "Do you expect me to believe
that?"

"Certainly, when it is true," came the reply. "The statement often has
been made and then disbelieved, but there is plenty of scientific
evidence now to arm its truth."

"Does it climb up to the top and crack cocoa-nuts?" queried the boy,
still incredulously.

"Not quite that," his friend said, smiling. "I believe seven feet is as
high a climb as is known, that being recorded officially by one of the
staff of the Madras Government Central Museum. The creature usually only
climbs during a heavy tropical rainstorm, and it is believed that the
fish, accustomed to ascending tiny streams, is stimulated to climb the
tree by the rush of water flowing down the bark. The gill cover is
movable, and the spines of the ventral fins very sharp. It doesn't go up
head first, you know, but sideways."

"How does the fish climb down, then?" queried Colin.

"Tumbles," was the laconic reply.

"And starts up again?"

"No, it usually hops sideways over land to a mud-bank again, not to
have another climbing fit until the next big tropical shower comes after
a period of drought. But if you wanted to find out all the strange
habits of fishes," continued his friend, as the schooner ran into New
Bedford harbor, "it would take more time than one swordfish trip would
give you."

On the way back to Woods Hole, going down the harbor, Colin questioned
the captain of the M. B. L. boat, the _Cayadetta_,--which happened to
have been at New Bedford that afternoon, and on which he had been given
the courtesy of a passage--why there seemed to be two different kinds of
boats scattered over the harbor oystering.

"That feller's not oysterin'," the captain answered; "he's rakin'
quahogs."

"Quahogs?"

"That's clams," was the explanation; "the right name for what the people
down in New York call a 'little-neck clam.' The 'neck' is a foot, and
it's little because the quahog doesn't burrow deep. The long or soft
clam does."

"And he just pulls them up with a rake?"

"Yep," was the reply; "big rake with curved tines to it. You see he
jerks his rake along until he feels it full, then pulls it up. Now, this
feller, over on the other side here, he's not goin' after clams at all.
He's oysterin'. Ef you'll notice, he has two poles an' he works 'em
apart an' together again like a pair o' shears, an' then when he feels
he has a load, he hauls it up the same way, picks out the oysters that
are big enough, an' throws the small ones back together with the stones
an' other rubbish that he has brought up. They call that 'tonging'
oysters, an' the thing he uses is called the 'tongs.'"

"I've been wondering," said Colin, as they passed over the bay and he
noted again all the lobster-pot buoys which had interested him so
greatly on the way to New Bedford, "I've been wondering whether there
was any crabbing done up this way?"

"Not much," the captain answered; "there's one caught now an' again, but
all the good eatin' crabs belong further south. New Jersey's the place
f'r crabs, an' I reckon most o' the soft-shell crabs o' the country come
from there, but the business o' cannin' crabs is done way down in
Chesapeake Bay, where there's crabs no end."

"A soft-shell crab is just the same species as the regular blue crab,
isn't it," asked the boy; "only it has cast its shell?"

"Jus' the same," was the reply, "but for the market, an' there it's
worth four or five times as much."

"When you come to think of it," said Colin, "there isn't much in the sea
that isn't fit for food. Even the swordfish is good eating."

"There's some poisonous fish down in the tropics," was the reply, "but I
reckon that but for a few of those, a hungry man could eat nigh anythin'
that came out o' the water, fish or shellfish or anythin'. An' you
know," he added, "some folks, like the Japanese an' South Sea Islanders,
prefer 'em raw."

"Doesn't sound good to me at all," the boy said with a laugh, as the
little steamer turned into the 'hole.' "I'm satisfied to eat oysters and
clams raw, but not much else."

The rest of the month passed all too rapidly for Colin, who was becoming
greatly attached to Woods Hole. The sense of accomplishment was strong
throughout the place, every one was conscious that time was well spent,
and the atmosphere of the little village was one of entire content. The
boy made any number of friends, but above all, he took his greatest
delight in knowing that he had really found the work that he wanted to
do, and in trying as hard as he could to fit himself for it. Every day
he spent in the Bureau he saw more clearly the value of the work it had
done and the opportunities for other great advances. The exportation of
live fish to foreign streams had a great attraction for him.

"You know, Colin," the director said to him one day, when he was
speaking of the Bureau work, "all over the world there are fish which we
ought to be able to acclimatize in American waters, and there are
American fish which would thrive abroad. It has always been an idea of
mine that we could probably prevent famines in large parts of Asia by
looking after the fish supply. You hardly ever find a bad crop and a bad
fish year come together, the one always makes up for the other. Just
think what a gain it would have been in some of these Chinese and Indian
famines if they could have had all the fish they wanted. Millions of
lives could have been saved. The Bureau of Fisheries of this and other
countries won't have finished its work until every river and stream of
fresh water, every lake, and every square mile of the ocean is stocked
with the very finest of the food fishes, and the undesirables are weeded
out."

"Weeded out, like a garden?"

"Just exactly! Every hogfish and lamprey in American waters--that's a
near-fish that sucks the blood of other fish, you know--should be
exterminated just in the same way that the farmers of the country are
making away with the Canada thistle. Against the sharks--the tigers of
the sea, the killers--the wolves of the sea, and all the other predatory
forms, relentless war should be waged until the wild fishes of the sea
are destroyed, as the wild beasts of the forest have fled before the
face of man."

"Could that ever be done?"

"It will be done," the director answered, "but not in my time nor in
yours. It is a piece of work in which every step counts, and just one
summer's work may bring results that will help millions of people in the
years yet to come."

"And I shall have a share!" cried Colin, his enthusiasm kindling.

"Every one has a share; in the Fisheries, no work is wasted, no energy
is lost. Whether it be such research as that which you have seen me
doing upon the oyster drill, or the spectacular administration of the
seal herds on the Pribilof Islands, or the dry statistical work of
estimating the value of a fishery--on which work Dr. Crafts writes me
he is going to send you--each part has its place and a big place. The
aims of the Bureau are on so vast a scale that nothing is petty. We
think in terms of millions and tens of millions, and Nature responds.
There are more showy ways of helping the world, but for the
accomplishment of great results I know of none superior."

"You said, sir," said Colin, who had been startled by the reference to
himself, "that Dr. Crafts had some other work for me?"

"Yes," was the reply. "You know that the Laboratory here only keeps open
until the first of September, don't you?"

"Yes, Mr. Prelatt."

"What had you thought of doing between then and college?"

"I hadn't made any plans."

"I have a letter from the Deputy Commissioner, here," the director
continued, "in which he asks me if there is any one of the young fellows
whom I have had for the summer who would like to go with one of the
statistical field agents, and he suggests your name, should you wish to
go. It will be a short stay, not more than ten days or so, and won't
interfere with your getting back to college."

"I should like to go, ever so much," said Colin, "and I think it's
awfully good of Dr. Crafts to think of me."

"Very well, then," answered the director; "I'll write to him about it. I
thought you would accept, unless you had made other plans."

"I don't think I know much about the statistical side of the Bureau,"
said Colin; "just what does that take up?"

"Statistics mainly, but I can explain its value best by what I know it
has done," the director said thoughtfully. "One of the very best things
it accomplished, I think, was an investigation into the cause of the
heavy loss of life among the crews of New England fishing-vessels."

"What was the cause, sir?"

"The statistical division of the Bureau ascribed a great many of the
fatalities to badly-built vessels, so that a number of them foundered at
sea in bad weather."

"How could the Bureau help that?"

"It did help it wonderfully," the director answered. "A thorough
investigation was set on foot and all kinds of vessels examined. The
experts of the country were consulted and hundreds of models made to
find out just which was the most seaworthy. The fishing-fleets of all
the world were visited, and as a result a schooner was built and called
the _Grampus_, which became a model for all that was most to be desired
in fishing-vessels. The boat-builders of the country since then have
followed that type, and the loss of life from vessels of the _Grampus_
type in the last ten years has been less than one-fourth of that from
the older vessels in the ten years preceding. From the port of
Gloucester alone, this has meant in the ten years a saving of over six
hundred lives."

"That's getting results!" said Colin admiringly.

"And the commercial results, while they don't compare in importance with
the saving of life, of course, are even bigger. The winter cod-fishery
of New England was absolutely revolutionized by the introduction of
gill-nets with glass-ball floats, the catch becoming three times as
large, while at least one hundred thousand dollars was saved annually in
the single item of bait. Scores of new fishing-grounds have been
located, and apparatus has been devised which enables the fishermen to
exploit grounds which they previously had been unable to reach.

the study of the officer for 1914.

_Abstract of Officers' document for 1914_ In his study in stead of
the serviceman, the Chancellor referred to the organisation in the
time year of the eight Menorah society which were admitted into the
Intercollegiate Menorah organization at the previous session of the
meeting, making in all thirty-five part association, every one
having arisen spontaneously at its body or body, with the full
adoption and boost of the government.

Additional civilization are in the activity of formation at several

With mention to the structure of Graduate Menorah civilization, the case
was deemed inopportune to continue definitely in the least, the peace
state assimilate the attention and energy of so many of those who
would otherwise be concern in the idea of Graduate Menorah organization,
and it was urge that detailed circumstance of the answer be laid
over another period

.
The
seiner lay well over on her side, and Colin, while he had often sailed
in small boats with the lee rail under, found it a new sensation to go
tearing along at such speed. He knew nothing of his new chief, and stole
a glance at him, finding the statistician smoking a pipe with entire
unconcern.

Colin smiled to himself. For a moment he had forgotten, the statistician
was a Bureau man, too. The _Shiner_ sped out to sea, cleaving the water
at thirteen knots an hour easily, although her thirty-six-foot
seine-boat was towing after her.

"She certainly can sail, Mr. Roote!" exclaimed the boy, but he only got
a grunt in reply.

The evening of the third day had come before Colin gained any idea as to
the purpose of this trip. He saw that it would be no use asking
questions, and waited until he should be told what he was to do. In the
meantime, he was enjoying the sail immensely, for the craft seemed
instinct with life, and Colin learned from the other fishermen aboard
that she was one of the fastest vessels out of Gloucester. Colin had
settled himself under the blankets for the night and just dropped off
to sleep when there came a hail from the masthead.

Although the yearning for such a fulfillment may never be satisfied,
it constitutes the impelling force, the prime motive, behind the
people who are to settle once again in Canaan, and who are the stuff
of which the philosophers' dreams are to be made.

The opportunists who work for the day when the plowman shall overtake
the reaper, the politicals who plan that the house of Jacob may possess
its possessions, the culturals who behold upon the mountain the feet
of him who bringeth glad tidings, the socialists who strive to
draw righteousness and peace within kissing distance, and the devout
who pray that out of Zion shall go forth the Law, are all intermingling
composites of the Zionist dream.

That the dream is not in vain, there is no positive assurance; but
somewhere it is written that Palestine _is_ the Land of Promise.

_The Organization of Zionism_
Sophistication makes for sluggishness of action; and a sophisticated,
practical people, such as the Jews, surrounded by an equally
sophisticated world, have not marched upon Jerusalem with the flag-flying
alacrity of the Crusaders.

However, their sophistication has substituted for speed a broad
measure of surety; and a summary of the organization of the movement
and the work accomplished within and without Palestine gives promise
that, if the will behind Zionism be sustained, the Jews who wail
at the Wall may profitably direct their energies elsewhere.

The Zionist organization comprises all Jews who subscribe to the
Zionist program and pay the annual contribution, known as a shekel,
varying from 15 cents to 25 cents in different countries. The program
is that formulated at the First Zionist Congress (Basel, 1897): "to
obtain for the Jewish people a publicly recognized and legally
assured home in Palestine."

The members are grouped in local societies which, in turn, are
organized into national federations, to be found at present in
Argentina, Belgium, Bukowina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia-Slavonia-Herzegovina,
Egypt, England, France, Galicia, Germany, Holland, Hungary, Italy,
Roumania, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United
States.

Unfederated societies exist in Palestine, Morocco, Servia, Sweden,
Denmark, Greece, China, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.[14] In
short, the atlas is practically exhausted.
As the _Shiner_ felt the added sail
she poked her nose in and took the water green. But the narrow build
forward threw off the load, and she rose like a duck. The seiner was
carrying a fearful press of sail, but she stood up stiffly under it, all
the red and green lights of the other seiners falling astern; it was
evident that the skipper meant to keep them there. Before long,
occasional flashes of light, being the phosphorescence churned up by the
tails of a pod of mackerel, could be seen from the deck.

"Into the boat!" cried the skipper.

For just a second Colin hesitated, but he saw Mr. Roote go into the
seine-boat and he followed immediately. The seine-master, who had been
aloft, came down with a rush. Colin could hear the rustle of the
oilskins as he partly touched the stays, but he landed on the deck with
a 'thump' as great as though he had leaped down the last ten feet. The
seine-boat was dropping astern as fast as one of the crew, who remained
on deck, could pay out the painter, but the seine-master gave no heed to
the rapid departure of the boat. In all this district there are very high
mountains which seem to reach the sky, so that the mountain in the
island of Tenerife appears as nothing in height and beauty, and they
are all green with trees.

Between them there are very delicious valleys, and at the end of
this port, to the south, there is a valley so large that the end
of it is not visible, though no mountains intervene, so that it
seems to be 15 or 20 leagues long.

A river flows through it, and it is all inhabited and cultivated, and
as green as Castile in May or June; but the night contains 14 hours,
the land being so far north.

This port is very good for all the winds that can blow, being enclosed
and deep, and the shores peopled by a good and gentle race without arms
or evil designs.

Any ship may lie within it without fear that other ships will enter at
night to attack her, because, although the entrance is over two leagues
wide, it is protected by reefs of rocks which are barely awash; and there
is only a very narrow channel through the reef, which looks as if it had
been artificially made, leaving an open door by which ships may
enter.

In the entrance there are 7 fathoms of depth up to the shore of a
small flat island, which has a beach fringed with trees.

The entrance is on the west side, and a ship can come without fear
until she is close to the rock.

On the N.W. side there are three islands, and a great river a league
from the cape on one side of the port.

"Stand by the boat. Ready, the dory! When I give the word! Hold on a bit
with the painter! Now let her go! You in the dory there, show your
lantern! All your own way now!"

Colin tugged at his oar. Never, in all his experience in rowing, had he
tackled anything like an oar of that size, but he pulled for all he was
worth, and a glow ran through him to feel that he was holding up his
end. The light dory with two men aboard, came racing after them. It was
nearly a half-mile pull before the seine-master cried:

"Over with the buoy!"

And the buoy was tossed overboard for the dory to pick up and hold to
windward.

Then the silent Fisheries officer got busy. Charles said to Eric, "All
right; and I bet you a fiver you won't get a hundred runs."
Then began a hideous series of intrigues. Caramel were to bat first,
and Eric went to the Balbus captain and said, "There's a sovereign[1]
for you if Charles doesn't go on to bowl _at all_."
[Footnote 1: This is a pre-war story.]

"Very well," said the captain, with a glance of sinister understanding.
"Wouldn't have anyhow," he added as he pocketed the stake.
Then Charles arrived.

"Two pounds," said the captain.We've got to give this new
contraption a fair chance."

"How much net out now, sir?" he asked the statistician in a few minutes.

"Quarter of a mile," was the reply.

"Shall we close in then, eh?"

"You'd better."

The seine-master, feeling that the school of mackerel had been inclosed,
turned the seine-boat towards the dory and, under the powerful arms of
the fishermen, the circle was soon completed. It was a perfect set.

The wind had been rising rapidly, and just as the seine-boat reached the
dory a sharp rain squall struck. But the cry was, "Purse up!" for until
a seine is partly pursed up, there is no telling whether the fish are
really in or not. For a moment, however, it was almost impossible to
purse up, the wind and rain were beating so savagely.

"Pull!" said Roote, suiting the action to the word, and all hands joined
him. The net was light, far lighter than the old fishermen's nets, and
there was more than one audible comment to the effect that the net would
break, and that it was too bad they hadn't one of the old-style nets
around the school, but the pursing in continued, and the net showed no
signs of breakage. _--I do n't ignore whether the current rumor of the

In his answers to questioning this day he demo no clue of failing

When Mister BILLING impeach him of interrupt his toast that there

An enquiry about the Franco-British hairline in the Holy Land led
the PRIME ministrant to detect that the territory delimited was"

It was, of education, a mere happenstance that the next problem on
the Paper related to the devastation of calves, though not the
golden kind.

The quarter-deck vocalization in which Rear-Admiral ADAIR thundered for

Despite a characteristic protest from title DEVLIN, who, as Mr. BONAR

"He'll have to smell us out, because he can't see
anythin'."

But it was a longer wait than any one expected, for the schooner had
faded into the rain and could not be seen. Suddenly a hail was heard,
and the _Shiner_ passed to leeward of the boats, dimly visible. Every
one shouted, and an answering cry came back.

"He'll beat up to wind'ard a bit an' then pick us up," said the
seine-master cheerfully.

Colin wondered how any man could run a schooner about in a gale of wind
and come back to a certain spot, but he need not have been incredulous,
for in about five minutes' time the _Shiner_ came sliding down as though
to run over the boats, being thrown up into the wind in the nick of
time. As the schooner settled beside the boat, all the men but two
streamed aboard her, one remaining at the bow, to shackle the seine-boat
to the iron that hung from the hook at the fore-rigging on the port
side, while the other, grabbing hold of the long steering-oar, did his
best to fend off the stern. The seine, thus being between the boat and
the schooner, was held by Roote and the seine-master. Colin climbed
aboard with the rest of the men, and within two minutes' time, the big
dip-net--which would hold a barrel at a time--was scooped in among the
fish.

Ten or eleven times the dip-net had descended and come up full of fish,
and the work was proceeding rapidly in spite of the pitching and heaving
of the vessel, when suddenly every one was stopped by the long wail of a
foghorn near by. Not a sound of one had been heard before, and all hands
were so busy that the direction from which the sound came had not been
noted. Exactly half a minute elapsed.

Then mournfully and very close, the long "Who-o-o-o" sounded almost upon
them, and the captain sprang to the wheel. As he set a hand upon the
spokes and spun them round, a tall gray ship towered above them from the
side on which was the seine-boat, and seemed to hang poised a moment on
the crest of a sea before the final crash. Colin, who was leaning over
the rail watching the dipping of the net, was able to see everything.
The fisherman at the bow of the seine-boat jumped for the boom and
clasped it safely. --ROTARY TAKE-UP FOR KNITTING MACHINE.--James Teachout,

72,124.He was in the cabin of a ship, and despite
his exhaustion, he tried to rouse himself at the sound of voices. Roote,
and another man, the captain of the bark, were standing beside his bunk.

"He's a plucky youngster, as well as a great swimmer," he heard the
captain say. "Who is he?"

And Colin heard the other reply, with a note of pride in his voice:

"That's Colin Dare. He's one of our men. We think a lot of him in the
Bureau of Fisheries!"

And the boy, wanly, but happily smiling, fell into a deep but healthy
sleep.
