    But round dis ole place Ise a-goin' to stay; Dar's one spot left,
they say, where I can evermore remain; Dar kindness makes my poor
heart throb and thrill; Ise growin' ole and weary, so I'll neber
roam again From de little log cabin on de hill!

    CHORUS.

    

      Oh de little log cabin, yes, de cabin on de hill; It's standing
there, the same old cabin still; 'neath de dear old roof I'll lie,
An' I'll lay me down an' die, In de little log cabin on de hill.

DARKEY SAM.

SONG AND CHORUS.

Arr. by J. YOUNG, Esq.

 
 
 1
 Oh my name is
 Darkey Sam, And I'se a
 black-eyed contraband; Down
 on de Chickahominee I
 was born; But old
 massa run away,
When de Linkum sogers play:
So, I started for de Norf in de
morn....
I soon met wid a man, And
he took me by de hand, And he brought me
to de Bobolition
meetin:

Dar de brudders made a speech, And de sisters 'gan to preach; Dey
said dat my complexion was light, And de world dey would teach What
a point dey could reach, And dey'd show dat dey could wash de
nigger white.

CHORUS.

I soon met wid a man, And he took
me by de hand, And he brought me to de Bobolition meetin:
Dar de brudders made a speech, And de sisters 'gan to preach:
Dey said dey could wash de nigger white.

2
Dey got me very soon, And dey put me in a room:
Dis nigger couldn't tell what dey was after; Dey took off all my
clothes, And den what does you suppose?

Dey put me in a tub of boilin' water!
