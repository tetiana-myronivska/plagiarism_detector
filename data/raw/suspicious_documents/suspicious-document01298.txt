the boys, now about 800 in number, dine; and here are held the 'Suppings
in Public,' to which visitors are admitted by tickets issued by the
Treasurer and by the Governors of Christ's Hospital.  The tables are laid
with cheese in wooden bowls, beer in wooden piggins, poured from leathern
jacks, and bread brought in large baskets.  The official company enter;

from St. Catherine's Church, by the Tower; a hymn is sung, accompanied by

Governor is payment of 500 pounds.--Ibid.


GENERAL NOTE.


One hears much about the 'hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,' and is
accustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned.  Edward Street,
Portman Square.

_Archbishop Williams' Persecutor, R.K._--Any information will be
thankfully received of the ancestors, collaterals, or descendants,
of the notorious R.K.--the unprincipled persecutor of Archbp.A general civility and attention to the
common run of ugly, and of middling men side, both which thought,
called, and treated, as odd people, would made me as many of friends, as
by the conduct I made myself force.There has never been a time--under the Blue Laws or any other--when above
FOURTEEN crimes were punishable by death in Connecticut.  But in England,
within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind, TWO HUNDRED
AND TWENTY-THREE crimes were punishable by death! {10}  These facts are
worth knowing--and worth thinking about, too.
