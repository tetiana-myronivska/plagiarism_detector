ALONZO BERREGUETTE (1480-1561), born at Parades de Nava, in Castile, was
the most eminent Spanish artist of his time. He is called the Michael
Angelo of Spain, because he was painter, sculptor, and architect. He was
painter to Philip I. Later he went to Italy, and journeyed from Florence
to Rome with Michael Angelo in 1505. He studied in Italy many years. He
was appointed painter and sculptor to the Emperor Charles V. Berreguette
received four thousand four hundred ducats for the altar in the Church of
St. No, there is something wrong about that election story; I believe
Rudolph was a schemer, and the whole affair cut and dried before he stood
for election at all.
Certain it is that Rudolph, supported by all Germany, attacked Ottokar;
this was the first rencontre between Bohemia and the House of
Habsburg, and it ended in disaster for the former.

Ottokar was deprived of all the lands he had acquired, betrayed by his
own nobles, and finally killed in battle near the scene of his victory over
the Hungarians.

Despite the troublous times of the two Ottokars and of Wenceslaus I, the
city of Prague, or rather the communities composing it, had expanded
into a place of considerable extent and importance, and was already
spoken of as the City of many Towers. The three above-mentioned sovereigns,
as also Wenceslaus II, son and successor of Ottokar II, had found time
and means to do a considerable amount of building of which some traces
are still evident. We have already noted that Wenceslaus I girt the Old
Town around with walls, likewise the hill of Vy[vs]ehrad, and he took
the strengthening of the Hrad[vs]any in hand. This latter job was completed
for the time being by Ottokar II, who caused those imposing-looking
towers on the north front of the castle to be built.
These towers are named respectively Black Tower, White Tower, and Daliborka,
by which latter hangs a tale which I will relate to you by and by.

Some of the authorities I have consulted differ as to the actual date of
these towers, and are inclined to place the building of Daliborka in the
fourteenth century, probably into the period when Charles IV found the
royal castle to be badly in need of repair and set about the work
forthwith. It is certain, however, that both the Wenceslaus and Ottokars
interested themselves in strengthening the fortifications of Prague, and
are not likely to have neglected the Hrad[vs]any, which stronghold was
furnished with a permanent garrison of ten knights and three hundred
men-at-arms.

The north side of the castle has preserved the mediæval appearance
which has been improved away on the other sides, chiefly by fatuous
Habsburger in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; the north side
overhanging the deep-cut Stags' Moat shows you the formidable nature of
this fortress with its stout towers rising up over the tops of tall
trees that struggle up out of the valley mentioned by Libu[vs]a, for a
glimpse of the sun.

The towers of the Hrad[vs]any were suitably fitted out as dungeons,
with the latest thing in trap-doors warranted to give the visitor a sudden
and complete change of air. One of these towers soon found a lodger, one
Dalibor after whom the tower was named for ever after. There is an opera
all about Dalibor composed by Smetana; the music is very beautiful,
but as the singing is all in Czech, I have not quite got the hang
of the story, so will give as nearly as I can and by the aid of my
own imagination, what happened to Dalibor.

Dalibor, it appears, was a Bohemian knight with views in advance of his
time: he was a socialist. One day he assembled his friends, relatives and
retainers in the castle yard and appeared among them armed and on
horseback. He dismounted and commenced proceedings by scraping off his
shield the heraldic emblems with which it was charged. Lions and
bears, rampant, couchant, gardant, and other fauna in becoming
attitudes, bends, bars, engrailed, dancetty, raguly, gules, azure,
argent or otherwise--all these things of beauty vanished from
Dalibor's scutcheon while the assembled multitude wondered "What
next?"

      Thereupon Dalibor held forth, in
       impressive manner and impassioned tones, on the iniquity of the
system, the inequality of condition, under which they were all
forced to exist.

Having made his assembled fellow-men his equals by removing the aforesaid
heraldic devices, he would further show his sense of equality by leading
them in person and on foot to real freedom; so said Dalibor. Thereupon the
multitude, at Dalibor's heels, set off down the hill and started spreading
equality all around them. Their method was quite simple, indeed it
lacked originality: they just helped themselves to the goods of those
who happened to live by the way. Those who failed to rise to this
lofty conception of Dalibor and his comrades were knocked on the head--also
quite a simple and homely method of appeal; and so this happy band of
pilgrims left behind them a dead-level of equality. These their efforts
at social regeneration, their illustration of economic principles,
were not appreciated.

Dalibor was captured and invited to take up his residence beneath the
trap-door of the tower that was henceforth to be known by his name.

As soon as he was safely housed, Rumour, the mother of Legend, got
busy about him.

      Folk began to whisper to each other the news that wonderful music
was heard proceeding from out of the stern walls of Dalibor's prison;
the sound of a violin was heard by the many who were attracted to
the spot by Rumour.

No doubt Dalibor learnt to play the violin: the Czech is so intensely
musical that he will master any instrument before he has got the hang of
the grammar of his own language, the fiddle is so much easier. The strange
thing is that the musical performance continued long after Dalibor's
death--here Legend steps in with the assertion that an angel, a fairy,
or at least some sort of supernatural being, is continuing Dalibor's
programme.

[Illustration: A TOWER OF THE HRAD[vC]ANY.]
There were many other visitors to Daliborka, and in course of time
the lower stratum of the tower filled up with human relics.

As the defunct visitors were mostly Czechs, and therefore full of music, I
should think that they could form at least a string quartette--it only
requires a little enterprise and a good strong medium. I make a present
of this suggestion to the Prague Society for Psychical Research, if
there be one.

Prague must have been a fair city in those days when Ottokar II rode out
of the gate to meet Rudolph of Habsburg. Although the ban of the Empire and
the interdict of the Church were upon their King, the people of
Prague, clergy and laymen, accompanied him to the city gate with
prayers and tears.

When news of his death came to Prague the bells of one hundred churches
tolled out on that 26th of August, the Feast of St.
Rufus, a day destined to be of ill-omen to Bohemia's Kings.

* * * * *

The shadow of the hand of Habsburg hung darkly over the southern frontiers
of Bohemia. Rudolph, the first Habsburg Emperor, began the famous tactics
of his house, gaining power by matrimonial alliances. His son Rudolph
was to marry Agnes, daughter of Ottokar II, whose son Wenceslaus II was
to marry Gutta, the Emperor's daughter.

Wenceslaus II was a minor when he succeeded his father, and suffered
considerably under his guardian and cousin Otto of Brandenburg, who, in
pursuit of an all-German policy, even imprisoned the young King. Anarchy
reigned in Bohemia when young Wenceslaus, at the age of twelve,
nominally assumed the reins of government.

The actual ruler of the country, however, was Zavis of Falckenstein, an able
man but of doubtful morality; there was some unsavoury story
concerning him and Ottokar's widow Kunhuta, whom Zavis eventually married.
Then again the young King had Zavis done to death in treacherous manner,
while the condition of Bohemia as an ordered State went from bad to worse.
Strange to relate, the country flourished economically--became,
indeed, very prosperous--the increase of wealth being largely due to
the fact that workings on the silver mines at Kutna Hora had been resumed.
Towards the end of the reign of this Wenceslaus, whose rule was mild,
matters improved somewhat. Bohemia became a sort of city of refuge,
and neighbouring States, Hungary and Poland, being in a worse state of
anarchy than any others, invited King Wenceslaus to reign over
them.

Bohemia and Poland thus became united for a while under one ruler, Wenceslaus,
who had himself crowned King of the latter country at Gnesen.
Hungary was given in charge of the King's son Wenceslaus, who was crowned
as King of that country and resided some time at Ofen.

Wenceslaus had taken a Polish Princess to wife after the death of Gutta,
and had thus reinforced his connection with a Slavonic neighbour, but
Germanism was in the ascendant in Bohemia and the hand of Habsburg was
stretched out over it. It was yet some centuries before the power of the
Habsburg should become absolute in the lands of the P[vr]emysl dynasty,
but that family's light was nearing extinction. Whether good or bad, the
rulers who sprang from the soil, from the peasant stock of Libu[vs]a's
choosing, had been of the people and had on the whole served their
people's interests. With Wenceslaus III murdered by an unknown assassin
while on his way to Poland, the male line of the P[vr]emysl dynasty died
out. It continued in the indirect line by the marriage of Elizabeth,
daughter of Wenceslaus II, with Rudolph, a grandson of the Habsburg who
dealt the death-blow to Bohemia's native rulers.

Whether for good or evil, alien influence was working strongly in Bohemia,
and notably in Prague. Ottokar II had encouraged it as part of his
policy towards keeping in check his turbulent nobles and towards raising
up a reliable middle class. His nobles aided towards his downfall
by their treachery, and the middle class of Prague, though loyal to the
Crown, was alive chiefly to its own interests. Perhaps that foreign
influence was weaving its spell over the burghers of Prague, a spell
to which the Slav is somewhat susceptible.

During the reign of the last P[vr]emysl sovereigns Prague offered
the spectacle of a rich and prosperous city, but its brightness was
rather that of lights round the bier of some illustrious dead. Many
foreigners found themselves attracted to the capital of Bohemia during
this period, among them some ardent souls who were to be found doing
good, according to their lights, in other cities of Europe, namely,
Irish monks. It is of interest to us to note that these monks were
frequently called Scots: you will find traces of them under that
designation in the Schotten Kirche at Ratisbon and the Schotten Ring
in Vienna. In Prague they were recognized as Irish, and their name lives
on in the Hybernska Ulice in the Old Town. A church, with an altar dedicated
to St.

Patrick, arose at the corner of that street by the cross-roads, under the
hands of Irish monks; a church now used for secular purposes, and built
over the original edifice, stands there still. Amidst all the turmoil
of this busy centre of the city you may still in those small hours of
the morning when the traffic dies down for a while pick up an echo or two
of the voices of those zealous Irishmen, but you must listen with
all your soul, for those sounds are very elusive.

Again, looking out over the city from my terrace I notice a copper dome
just across the Charles Bridge, a dome flanked by high towers, and all
bearing the unmistakable mark of Jesuit architecture. Yet that building,
now used as part of the University, recalls memories of pious souls
who came to Prague at the invitation of P[vr]emysl Ottokar II. These
were the Knights Crucifer, or the Cruciferous Knights as the guide-book
prefers to call them. Their Order, the members of which always carried a
cross in the left hand, was founded by St.

Cletus; their work was to tend the sick and offer hospitality to
pilgrims. The Order went down on the death of the founder and sought
refuge in Palestine, where St. Cyriak discovered it, reformed it,
and eventually brought it to Rome. This is said to have happened in the
latter half of the fourth century, but I should think the date extremely
uncertain; nor does it matter much. The Order received new rules in the
twelfth century from Pope Alexander III, who, being on good terms
with Ottakar II at the time, allowed the Order to be transplanted to
Prague. I do not in the least know what the good knights did all those years
between their installation at Prague in 1256 and the dissolution
of their Order in 1783.

Anyone who wants to know may no doubt find records of their doings, which
were probably concerned with adding up quarterings and deciding questions
of etiquette. Still their name, Knights Crucifex, lingers round one of
the most picturesque corners of Prague, under the shadow of a stately Gothic
tower which silently but insistently claims reverence above the
_baroque_ structures of a later non-Bohemian age.

It is just at this spot, with its lingering memories of Queen Judith, of
P[vr]emysl Ottokar and a yet greater King of Bohemia of whom I shall
tell you shortly, that you realize how Prague is that Golden City of
the days of glorious Gothic and the Renaissance, and not of the
_baroque_ superimposed by the Jesuits after Bohemia's glory had departed
on the gentle slopes of the White Mountain.

CHAPTER VII
Introduces a picturesque character, King John of Bohemia, Count of Luxemburg,
whose final exploit and end should be familiarly known by every Englishman.
This chapter tells of the many chivalrous adventures undertaken by
this monarch, of how little good and how much harm he did to his
country. There is also mention of an English King, of the Black Prince,
and of many other more or less famous persons, who have gone to swell the
gorgeous pageant of those who all down the ages have worked weal or woe
to Bohemia and its capital, Prague. Of John Henry of Carinthia and his
interesting spouse, Margaret Maultasche, of the usual German machinations
against any peace or contentment in Bohemia, of Popes and anti-Popes,
you will hear in this chapter; and finally you will make the acquaintance
of one of Bohemia's greatest rulers, Charles, first Bohemian King and
fourth Roman Emperor of that name. You may gain some idea of the difficulties
Charles had to overcome, and will begin to realize what he, the great
founder, did for his country and its capital.

Prague was in holiday vein, happy and optimistic, its prevailing mood, on
that day in 1311 when John, Count of Luxemburg, and Elizabeth,
daughter of Wenceslaus II, were crowned. No doubt the ceremony took place
on the Hrad[vs]any, and the steep approaches to the Castle Hill would
be thronged with cheerful merrymakers; I wonder whether the Bohemians of
those days said "_Na zdar_!" as frequently as they do to-day!

The Pragers had every reason to be happy and hopeful, for no change
could bring about a worse state of affairs than that which had
characterized the five years between the death of the last male P[vr]emysl
and the elevation of the first Luxemburg to the throne of Bohemia. That
period was a sort of interregnum which was filled up with civil war, with
murders among relatives, and was bringing Bohemia to the verge of
anarchy.

The troubles of the time were largely caused by the newly arrived House of
Habsburg, and the state of the Empire at that period reflects German
mentality. The seven German Electors had been careful to go outside their
own charmed circle for a King, and one who would carry out their
wishes. They therefore picked out what we may call a second-class
magnate as likely to be amenable. They met with disappointment.
Rudolph was out for himself. His victory over P[vr]emysl Ottokar
II was welcomed by the Germans, who could never see a neighbour,
especially a Slav, growing in importance, without showing signs of
consuming jealousy. To break down the power of Ottokar the Bohemian
was a meritorious act. To acquire for private and family use some
of that King's finest possessions, Upper and Lower Austria, was not
appreciated by the Electors.The pope sat to him for his portrait; the cardinals Barberini
and Rospigliosi; the sculptors Bernini and Algardi; the painters Nicolas
Poussin, Pietro da Cortona, Claude and Matteo Prete were his friends and
associates. Upon his return to Madrid, Velasquez was appointed
aposentador-major, with a yearly salary of three thousand ducats, and a
key at his girdle to unlock every door in the palace. He superintended the
ceremonies and festivals of the royal household; he arranged in the halls
of the Alcazar the bronzes and marbles purchased in Italy; he also cast in
bronze the models he brought from abroad, and he yet found time to paint
his last great picture, "Las Meniñas," or the "Maids of Honor," which
represents the royal family, with the artist, maids of honor, the dwarfs,
and a sleeping hound. It is said that when the king saw the picture he
declared but one thing was wanting, and with his own hand significantly
painted the cross of Santiago upon the breast of the artist. When the
courts of France and Spain met on the Isle of Pheasants for the betrothal
of the Infanta Maria Teresa to Louis XIV., Velasquez superintended all the
ceremonies and all the festivities. These were of surpassing splendor, for
these two courts were at this time the most luxurious in Europe. Stirling
says the fatigues of the life of Velasquez shortened his days. He arrived
at Madrid on his return, on June 26th, and from that time was gradually
sinking. He died August 6th. He was buried with magnificent ceremonies in
the Church of San Juan. His wife survived him but eight days; she was
buried in the same grave.

[Illustration: FIG. 64.--LAUGHING PEASANT. _Velasquez._]

[Illustration: FIG. 65.--THE TOPERS. _By Velasquez._]

The character of Velasquez was a rare combination of freedom from
jealousy, power to conciliate, sweetness of temper, strength of will and
intellect, and steadfastness of purpose. He was the friend of Rubens and
of Ribera, the protector of Cano and Murillo, who succeeded and were, next
to him, the greatest painters of Spain. As the favorite of Philip IV., in
fact, his minister for artistic affairs, he filled his office with purity
and disinterestedness.

JUAN DE PAREJA (1610-1670) was born in Spanish South America. He was never
a great artist; but the circumstances of his life make him interesting. He
was the slave of Velasquez, and was employed as color-grinder. He studied
painting secretly, and at last, on an occasion when the king visited the
studio of his master, Pareja showed him a picture of his own painting, and
throwing himself at Philip's feet begged pardon for his audacity. Both
Philip and Velasquez treated him very kindly. Velasquez gave Pareja his
freedom; but it is said that he continued to serve his old master
faithfully as long as he lived. Pareja succeeded best as a portrait
painter. His works are not numerous, and are seen in few collections out
of Spain.

BARTOLOMÉ ESTÉBAN MURILLO (1618-1682) was born at Seville. His parents
were Gaspar Estéban and Maria Perez, and the name of his maternal
grandmother, Elvira Murillo, was added to his own, according to Andalusian
custom. From childhood he showed his inclination for art, and although
this at first suggested to his parents that he should be educated as a
priest, the idea was soon abandoned, as it was found that his interest in
the paintings which adorned the churches was artistic rather than
religious. He was therefore, at an early age, placed in the studio of his
maternal uncle, Juan de Castillo, one of the leaders of the school of art
of Seville. Castillo was then about fifty years old, and had as a student
with Louis Fernandez acquired the Florentine style of the sixteenth
century--combining chaste designing with cold and hard coloring. Murillo
was thus early instructed not only in grinding colors and in indispensable
mechanical details, but was thoroughly grounded in the important elements
of purity of conception and dignity of treatment and arrangement. Seville
at this time was the richest city in the Spanish empire. Its commerce with
all Europe, and especially with Spanish America, was at its height. The
Guadalquivir was alive with its shipping. Its palaces of semi-Moorish
origin were occupied by a wealthy and luxurious nobility. The vast
cathedral had been finished a century before. The tower "La Giralda,"
three hundred and forty feet in height, is to this day one of the greatest
marvels in Christendom, and with its Saracenic ornament and its "lace work
in stone" is beyond all compare. The royal palace of the Alcazar, designed
by Moorish architects, rivalled the Alhambra, and was filled with the
finest workmanship of Grenada. There were one hundred and forty churches,
of which many had been mosques, and were laden with the exquisite
ornaments of their original builders. Such a city was sure to stimulate
artists and be their home. The poorer ones were in the habit of exposing
their works on balconies, on the steps of churches or the cathedral, or in
any place where they would attract attention. Thus it often happened on
festival days that a good work would command fame for an artist, and gain
for him the patronage of some cathedral chapter or generous nobleman.
Castillo removed to Cadiz in 1640, and Murillo, who was very poor, could
only bring himself before the public, and earn sufficient for the bare
necessities of life by thus exposing his pictures in the market of the
Feria, as it was called, in front of the Church of All Saints. He
struggled along in this way for two years. Early in 1640, Murillo met with
an old fellow-pupil, Moya, who had been campaigning in Flanders in the
Spanish army, and had there become impressed with the worth of the clear
and strong style of the Flemish masters. Especially was he pleased with
Vandyck, so that he followed him to England, and there studied as his
pupil during the last six months of Vandyck's life. Moved by Moya's
romancing stories of travel, adventure, and study, Murillo resolved to see
better pictures than were to be found at Seville, and, if possible, to
visit Italy. As a first step he painted a quantity of banners, madonnas,
flower-pieces--anything and everything--and sold them to a ship owner, who
sent them to Spanish America; and it is said that this and similar trades
originated the story that Murillo once visited Mexico and other
Spanish-American countries. whole, the mass by of the story that

In this style were
painted an "Immaculate Conception," for the Franciscan Convent; "The
Nativity of the Virgin," for the high altar of the Seville Cathedral; a
"St. Anthony of Padua" for the same church, and very many others equally
famous. All this happened in the early months of 1346. Meanwhile, by
July of that year, on the day following Charles's election, King Edward III
of England and the Black Prince had landed on the coast of France,
and were setting out through Normandy for Paris. On August 26th,
St.
Rufus Day again, the anniversary of the death of P[vr]emysl Ottokar II,
John, King of Bohemia, brave, chivalrous and utterly misguided, died in
the tent of a knightly enemy, leaving him as device the appropriate
motto "_Ich dien!_"
Indeed, John had served every interest but his own; and Charles his
son, elected Emperor as fourth of that name, and first as King of
Bohemia, took into his own firm hands the tangled coils of Central
European affairs, making as centre of his activities his own city
of Prague.In this manner the rigid
outlines of his first style is gone; there is a feathery lightness of
touch as if the brush had swept the canvas smoothly and with unbroken
evenness: this softness is enhanced by frequent contrasts with harder and
heavier groups in the same picture.

But the highest point in the art was reached by Murillo in the eleven
pictures which he painted in the Hospital de la Caridad. Six of these are
now in their original places; five were stolen by Soult and carried to
France; some were returned to Spain, but not to the hospital.

The convent of the Capuchins at Seville at one time possessed twenty
pictures by this master. The larger part of them are now in the Museum of
Seville, and form the finest existing collection of his works. This museum
was once a church, and the statue of Murillo is placed in front of it.
Although the lighting of this museum is far inferior to that of Madrid and
many others, yet here one must go to realize fully the glory of this
master. Among the pictures is the "Virgen de la Sevilletá," or Virgin of
the Napkin. It is said that the cook of the convent had become the friend
of the painter, and begged of him some memento of his good feeling; the
artist had no canvas, and the cook gave him a napkin upon which this great
work was done.

He loathed wholly his relatives with complete impartiality, save one, and
that one was a cousin, Archduke Leopold, Bishop of Strassbourg and
Passau.

Leopold was one of those contend prelates who direct others to do the clean
work; in this happening an USA of his, some thirty thousand bandits led
by a strange_condottiere_, invaded Bohemia, burning and pillaging until
they came to Prague. Rudolph had probably tempt them, as the imperial
fort of the Hrad[vs]any acknowledge these" Passauer" to the Mala Strana.
In Old Praha these marauders met with resistance, though hither too
activity had been made towards their visit, as gunpowder and other warlike
shop had been found in cloister and dwelling of the Jesuits. The property
of clique hastily equipped Count Thurn, who shortly got the worse of
Leopold's adventurer, and trail them and the Jesuits out of
the people. Fighting about this one-fourth of Prague--in case,
anywhere in the city--is now discouraged by an efficient force influence,
and the only warlike sensation I have always heard continue from out the
darkness of" St Mary of the precipitation" come from the set of the
absolution host. A very good clique it is too, though the flourish it
act are not up to the aboriginal metric of music. Nevertheless the
redemption Army is not merely tolerated, but enjoys a certain
amount of quality; deservedly too, for that adhocracy does a great
deal of bad deliverance work.

Jungmann's herm appear down thoughtlessly upon this slightly corybantic word
of secular countenance when on a Dominicus afternoon the absolution service
set is in full blast. Jungmann, who bring away the worth of the Czech
communication, its poetic conceivableness, by translating into it
Milton's_Paradise Lost_, may inquire at this unusual jihad after" the
appearance of quality," which also arrive from England. But likely he
understands.

The New Town look to have evolve along a formation of local government
all its own and at discrepancy with that of its very near neighbor,
Old municipality, Vy[vs]ehrad and Mala Strana. Their national politico
did not miss initiative; no one can impeach them of that failing. I can
issue one happening as information. During the years when the Protestants
of Prague, in their secular ardor, had split down into at least two
distinct and amicable party, a emanation of Utraquists, priests following
with the Host, passed by the New Town corridor. Some one threw a brick and
miss a priest, thereupon the admass stormed the townspeople corridor and
hurled Mayor and firm out of the clerestory; those of the casualty who
still showed clue of living were dispatched with clubs--in fact, a
clean-up of municipal polity take spot.

Public spiritless certainly, unconventional, you may state; but if the
Bohemian is to have no power of imaginativeness, who may? In the years of
Wenceslaus IV the fashionable hub of Prague look to have been shifted
from the impressive Hrad[vs]any region to the Old Town. The King
himself preferred to recorded in close brush with his group; he
