and winks, that it was all right about Heligoland, was more
than they could put up with. O'PICTON sat morose at the corner

age the murderer is the husband and father; saw him do it with their

to table, drop a penny in the slot, and out would come the answer--'I
have seen nothing; I have heard nothing.'"

Seems that HANBURY has exceptional means of obtaining information.
OLD MORALITY has privately shown him Military Report with respect
to Heligoland. A confidential communication, something of the
kind the MARKISS carried on with the population of Heligoland. But
HANBURY straightway goes and tells all about it is impossible for
the Government to than_that_--oh, what a_delicious_ waltz!

SUMMERS reads it out to House. Eagerly thirsting after knowledge
on military matters, SUMMERS wants also to see the text of
Report. Why should HANBURY have it all to himself? Quartermaster-General
SUMMERS would like opportunity of studying it, and forming opinion
as to accuracy of the and military men who have drawn up plan.
Will OLD MORALITY favour him by placing him on an equality

significantly eyeing Mr.

Opposition shouted with laughter, whilst OLD MORALITY stood and
stared, and wondered what was amusing them now.

New Session is, to present intentions, to open in November.
Will the Land Purchase Bill be taken first? Mr. G. wants to know."
Sir," said OLD MORALITY," I have indicated the views of the
Government as to the Land Purchase Bill, according as those views
are held at the present time."( Cheers from the Ministerialists
say what circumstances may occur to qualify those views." Once

Be not afraid to report,
for times can come when even a mother's heart is past breaking
--being already broke."

"Abide," said the king, "and give the woman to eat.  I will go."
And he put down the knapsack.

I turned to start, but the king had already started.  He halted,
and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light, and had not
noticed us thus far, or spoken.

"Is it your husband?" the king asked.

"Yes."

"Is he asleep?"

"God be thanked for that one charity, yes--these three hours.
Where shall I pay to the full, my gratitude! for my heart is
bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now."

I said:

"We will be careful.  We will not wake him."

"Ah, no, that ye will not, for he is dead."

"Dead?"

"Yes, what triumph it is to know it!  None can harm him, none
insult him more.  He is in heaven now, and happy; or if not there,
he bides in hell and is content; for in that place he will find
neither abbot nor yet bishop.  We were boy and girl together; we
were man and wife these five and twenty years, and never separated
till this day.  Think how long that is to love and suffer together.
This morning was he out of his mind, and in his fancy we were
boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields; and so in
that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther, still
lightly gossiping, and entered into those other fields we know
not of, and was shut away from mortal sight.  And so there was
no parting, for in his fancy I went with him; he knew not but
I went with him, my hand in his--my young soft hand, not this
withered claw.  Ah, yes, to go, and know it not; to separate and
know it not; how could one go peace--fuller than that?  It was
his reward for a cruel life patiently borne."

There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where
the ladder was.  It was the king descending.  I could see that he
was bearing something in one arm, and assisting himself with the
other.  He came forward into the light; upon his breast lay a
slender girl of fifteen.  She was but half conscious; she was dying
of smallpox.  Well, we're jest about going it, at the reel" Hotel,"
