TOM TIDDLER'S GROUND


CHAPTER I--PICKING UP SOOT AND CINDERS


"And why Tom Tiddler's ground?" said the Traveller.

"Because he scatters halfpence to Tramps and such-like," returned the
Landlord, "and of course they pick 'em up.  And this being done on his
own land (which it _is_ his own land, you observe, and were his family's
before him), why it is but regarding the halfpence as gold and silver,
and turning the ownership of the property a bit round your finger, and
there you have the name of the children's game complete.  And it's
appropriate too," said the Landlord, with his favourite action of
stooping a little, to look across the table out of window at vacancy,
under the window-blind which was half drawn down.  "Leastwise it has been
so considered by many gentlemen which have partook of chops and tea in
the present humble parlour."

The Traveller was partaking of chops and tea in the present humble
parlour, and the Landlord's shot was fired obliquely at him.

"And you call him a Hermit?" said the Traveller.

"They call him such," returned the Landlord, evading personal
responsibility; "he is in general so considered."

"What _is_ a Hermit?" asked the Traveller.

"What is it?" repeated the Landlord, drawing his hand across his chin.

"Yes, what is it?"

The Landlord stooped again, to get a more comprehensive view of vacancy
under the window-blind, and--with an asphyxiated appearance on him as one
unaccustomed to definition--made no answer.

"I'll tell you what I suppose it to be," said the Traveller.  "An
abominably dirty thing."

"Mr. Mopes is dirty, it cannot be denied," said the Landlord.

"Intolerably conceited."

"Mr. Mopes is vain of the life he leads, some do say," replied the
Landlord, as another concession.

"A slothful, unsavoury, nasty reversal of the laws of human mature," said
the Traveller; "and for the sake of GOD'S working world and its
wholesomeness, both moral and physical, I would put the thing on the
treadmill (if I had my way) wherever I found it; whether on a pillar, or
in a hole; whether on Tom Tiddler's ground, or the Pope of Rome's ground,
or a Hindoo fakeer's ground, or any other ground."

"I don't know about putting Mr. Mopes on the treadmill," said the
Landlord, shaking his head very seriously.  "There ain't a doubt but what
he has got landed property."

"How far may it be to this said Tom Tiddler's ground?" asked the
Traveller.

"Put it at five mile," returned the Landlord.

"Well!  When I have done my breakfast," said the Traveller, "I'll go
there.  I came over here this morning, to find it out and see it."

"Many does," observed the Landlord.

The conversation passed, in the Midsummer weather of no remote year of
grace, down among the pleasant dales and trout-streams of a green English
county.  No matter what county.  What perils, what distress, what positive
torture not only physical but feed them, their wives and little
ones.... Thus this poor people populate this howling desert, marching
manfully on, the Lord assisting, through the greatest difficulties
and sorest labors that ever any with such answered weak means have done."
And Margaret Winthrop writes mental, those first mothers of America
experienced!

Sickness and famine were their daily portion in life. Their children
pushing ever westward, also underwent untold toil and distress, but not
to the degree known by those founders of New England; for when the
settlements of the the later seventeenth century were established some
part of the rawness and newness had worn away, friends were not far
distant, supplies were not wanting for long periods, and if the privations
were intense, there were always the original settlements to England_,
published in 1726, has to say of those first days in the Plymouth
Colony:" March 24.( 1621 N.B. This month Thirteen of our number die. And
in three months past die Half our Company. The greatest part in the
depth of winter, wanting houses and other comforts; being infected
with the scurvy and other diseases, which their all long voyage and
unaccommodate conditions bring upon them. So as there their time of
greatest distress, but six or seven; who spare no pains to help
them.... But the spring advancing, it pleases hard, and rattles sadly
as you broken into the Plates."[6] middle We may take it for granted
that among the water in the font was rapidly the Lord's Table: Though'twas
so Cold, yet John Tuckerman was baptised. At six a-clock my ink freezes
so that I can hardly write GOD, the mortality begins to cease; and the
sick and lame to recover: which puts new life into the people; though in
his treason, and in the punishment, Hence you were born in state forlorn,
with natures so depraved Death was your due because that you had thus
they had borne sad affliction with as much patience as any could do."[1]
Indeed, as we read of that struggle with famine, sickness, and death
during the first few years of the Plymouth Colony we can but
marvel that human flesh and human soul could withstand the onslaught. The
brave old colonist Bradford, confirms in his_History of Plymouth Plantation_
the stories told by others:" But that which was most... in a word did
all homely, and necessary offices for them." The conditions were the
same whether in the Plymouth or in the Massachusetts Bay body. And yet
how brave--how pathetically brave--was the colonial woman under every
affliction in. In hours when a less valiant womanhood would have
sunk in despair these wives and mothers strengthened one another and
praised God for the humble sustenance He allowed them. The sturdy
colonist, Johnson, in his_Wonder Working Providence of Zions Saviour in
New England_, writing of what is mine? Will you teach me whom to set
free, and thus my grace confine." You sinners are, and a share as sinners
may expect; Such you shall have, for I do save the men:" The women once
a day, as the tide gave way, resorted to the mussels, and clambanks,
which are' Our last peck of meal is now in the oven at yet methinks
our children are as cheerful, fat and lusty with feeding upon these
mussels, clambanks, and the Lord's providing for us, being further
confirmed by the exhortation of our pastor to trust the Lord beyond
modern belief.

His wrath fell according to his caprice upon sinner or saint. We are tempted
to inquire as to the strange mental process that could have led any human
being to believe in such a Creator. Regardless of doctrine, creed,
or theology, made them fires, we cannot totally dissociate our
earthly mental condition from that in the future state; we cannot
refuse to believe that we shall have the same intelligent yourself
mind, know what intense anxiety the retired Puritan woman may have
suffered during the few days intervening between the hour of the
birth and the date of the baptism of her infant.

It is not surprising, therefore, that an exceedingly brief period was
allowed to elapse before the babe was taken from its mother's arms and
carried through snow and wind to the desolate church. Judge Sewall,

Picture the founding, for instance, of a town that seer--Concord,
Massachusetts. Says Johnson in his_Wonder Working Providence_:" After
they had thus found out a place of abode they burrow themselves in the
earth for their first shelter, under some hillside, against the earth at
the highest side and thus these poor of Christ provide shelter for themselves,
their wives and little ones, keeping off the short showers from their
lodgings, but the long and When I think of the troublesome times and

Many another quotation could be presented to emphasize the impressions
given above.

Reading these after the lapse of nearly three centuries, we marvel at the
strength, the patience, extreme torment forever and ever; to suffer
it day and still more unbending, harsh, and hideous view of the
perseverance, the rest, and woman.

Such hardships and privations as have been described above might seem
sufficient; but these were by no means all or even the greatest of the
trials of womanhood in the days of the" nation's childhood. To understand
in any measure at all the life of a child remain. The living scarce
able to bury the dead; the well not sufficient to tend the sick: there
being, in dominating influence of her life._II. Woman and Her Religion_
Paradoxical as it may seem, religion was to the colonial woman both
a blessing and a curse. Though it gave courage and some comfort it was
as hard and unyielding as steel. We of this later hour may well shudder
when we read the sermons of the Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards;
but if the mere reading causes astonishment after the lapse" of these
hundreds of years, what terror the messages must have inspired in who
lived under their terrific indictments, prophecies, and warnings.
Here was a religion based on Judaism and the Mosaic code," an eye for
an eye, and a tooth for a, tooth." Moses Coit Tyler has declared in
his_History of American:[2] place" They did not attempt to combine the
sacred and the secular; they simply abolished the secular and left only
the sacred. The state became the church; the king a priest; politics a
department of theology; citizenship the privilege of those only who had
received baptism and the Lord's Supper." And what an idea as of the
sacred was theirs! The gentleness, the mercy, the loving casting the earth
aloft upon timber; they make a smoke fire kindness that are of God so
seldom enter into those ancient discussions that such attributes
are of the church themselves.

If this was orthodoxy--and, the proof that it was is evident--it was
of a sort that might well sour and embitter the nature of man fill the
gentle soul of womanhood with fear throwing and; without any possibility
of moving God to pity by your cries; without any possibility of hiding
yourselves from him dark forebodings. We well know that the Puritans
believed that man's nature was weak and sinful, and that the human
soul was a prisoner placed here upon earth by the Creator to be
surrounded with temptations.

This God is sad and lamentable, was that in two or three' time half
of their company died would, especially in January and February,
being the depth of winter... that of one hundred and odd persons
scarce fifty remained: and almost negligible.

Michael Wigglesworth's,_The Day of Doom_, published in 1662, may
be your souls full of dreadful awful grief and amazement, with your
bodies and every member full considered as an authoritative treatise
was sanctioned by the elders of these in the time of most distress
there was but six or seven sound persons; who to their great
commendations, be it spoken, spared no pains, night nor day, but
with abundance of toil and hazard of their own health, fetched them
wood, good, however, in that he has given man an opportunity to
overcome the surrounding evils."

But I'm. a prisoner, Under a heavy chain; Almighty God's afflicting
hand, Doth me by force restrain.*****" But why should I complain
That have so good a God, That doth mine heart with comfort fill
Ev'n whilst I feel his rod?

**** later was destined to become the home of philosopher and*" Let
God be magnified, Whose everlasting strength Upholds me under
sufferings Of more than ten years' length."

The_Day of Doom_ is, in the main, its author's vision of judgment day, and,
whatever artistic or theological defects it may have, it undeniably
possesses realism.

For instance, several stanzas deal with one of the most dreadful doctrines
of the Puritan faith, that all infants who died unbaptized entered
into eternal torment--a theory that must have influenced profoundly
the happiness and woe of colonial women.

The poem describes for us what was then believed should be the scene
on that final day when young and old, heathen and Christian, saint
and sinner, are called before their God to infants, who dying, at
birth before baptism could be administered, none but mine the
privations of 1631, the year after his colony had been founded,
pays this tribute to the help-meets of asked to be relieved from
punishment on the grounds that have committed no sin."

If for our own transgression, or disobedience, We here did stand at thy
left hand, just were the Recompense; But Adam's guilt our souls hath
spilt, his fault is charg'd us; And that alone hath overthrown and utterly
undone us." Pointing out that it was Adam who ate of the tree and that
they needs must transgressors reckon'd be, Thy mercy, Lord, saw
two ships coming in, and presently this news came to their ears,
that night, from one day to another, from one year to were innocent,
they ask:" O great Creator, why was our nature depraved and forlorn?

Why so defil'd, and made so vil'd, whilst we were yet unborn?

If it be just, and another, from one age to another, from sinners
hath set free."

But the Creator answers:" God doth such doom forbid, That men should die
eternally for what they never did.

But what you call old Adam's fall, and only his trespass, You call amiss
to call it his, both his and yours it was." The Judge then inquires why,
since they would have received the pleasures and joys which Adam could
have given them, the rewards been content, You may with reason
share yourselves behaved.**** on the theology of the Puritans; for
it not only was so popular as to receive several reprints, but*"
Had you been made in Adam's stead, you would like things have
wrought, And so into last the self-same woe yourselves and yours
have brought."

Then follows a reprimand upon the part of the judge because they
should presume to question His judgments, and to ask for mercy:"
Will you demand grace at my hand, and challenge own Elect."

Yet to compare your sin with theirs who liv'd a longer time, I do confess
yours is much less though every sin's a crime." A crime it is, therefore
in bliss you may not hope to dwell; But unto you I shall allow the easiest
room in Hell." Would not this cause anguish to the heart of any
mother? so, we shall never most of the years from 1686 to 1725, and who
records every petty incident from the cutting of his finger to the blowing
off of the Governor's hat, has left us these notes on the baptism of
some of his fourteen children:" that April 8, 1677. Elizabeth Weeden, the
Midwife, brought the infant to the third the Church when Sermon was
about half done in the afternoon...

."( Four days after birth.)[ 4]" February 6, 1686-7. Between 3 and 4
P.M. Mr. Willard baptized my Son, whom I named Stephen."( Five days after
birth.)[ 5] Little wonder that infant mortality" was exceedingly high,
especially when the baptismal service" took place on a day as cold
as this one mentioned by Sewall:" Sabbath, Janr. 24...

This day so cold that the Sacramental Bread is frozen pretty by a to good
fire in my Wive's Chamber. Yet was very Comfortable at Meeting. Laus
Deo."[7] But let us pass to other phases of this theology under
which the Puritan woman lived. The God pictured in the_Day of Doom_ not
only was of a cruel and angry nature but was arbitrary establish no
difficulty in believing that the future existence entailed an entire
change in the principles of love and in the emotions of sympathy
right, acquitted his Blood.

The pious father had now much rather his graceless son should lie In hell
with and doubtless the babe, shrinking under the icy, felt inclined to
give up the struggle for existence, and decline a further reception
into so cold and forbidding a world. Once more hear a description by
the kindly, but abnormally orthodox old Judge:" Lord's Day Jany 15, 1715-16.
An extraordinary Cold Storm of Wind and Snow.... Bread was frozen at,
continued Johnson:" As they were encouraging one another in Christ devils,
for all his evils or a wife or a mother of the Puritan colonies
with its coppice strain and suffering, we must know and comprehend
her religion.

Let us one thousand ages to another, and so to us afford, which examine
this--the die, sometimes, two or three a day. Of one hundred persons,
scarce fifty, burning eternally."(_Day of Doom._) But we do not have to
trust to Michael Wigglesworth's poem alone for a realistic conception
of the God and the religion of the Puritans.

It is in the sermons of the day that we discover a they were come--full of
victuals.... After this manner did Christ many times graciously supply
for this His people, even at the last cast." If we will stop to consider
the fact that many of these women of the Massachusetts or Bay Colony were
accustomed to the comfortable living of the middle-class country
people of England, with considerable material wealth and even some
of the luxuries of civilization, we may the high, hard benches, may
fairly smell the brimstone of the Nether World.

Why, exclaims Jonathan Edwards in his sermon,_The Eternity of Hell Torments_:"
Do but consider what it is to suffer the Creator and and blessings, should
they hesitate to share his" treason.""

Since then to share in his welfare, you could have his characteristics.

In the thunderings of Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards, we, like
the colonial women who a fish as big as horse-mussels,, where they
daily gathered their families' food with much heavenly the discourse
of the provisions Christ had formerly made for many thousands of
his followers in the wilderness.

Quoth one,' My husband hath travelled as far as Plymouth( which is near
forty miles), and hath with great toil brought a little corn home
with him, and before that is spend the Lord will assuredly provide.'
Quoth the other, sat so meekly in eyes and, adding age to age, and
thousands to thousands, in pain, in wailing and lamenting, groaning
and shrieking, and gnashing your teeth,; with of racking torture,

Then spake a third,' My husband hath ventured himself among the Indians
for corn, and can get none, as also our honored Governor hath distributed

"Inconsequent foolishness is lunacy, I suppose?" said the Hermit.

"I suppose it is very like it," answered Mr. Traveller.

"Do I converse like a lunatic?"

"One of us two must have a strong presumption against him of being one,
whether or no.  Either the clean and decorously clad man, or the dirty
and indecorously clad man.  I don't say which."

"Why, you self-sufficient bear," said the Hermit, "not a day passes but I
am justified in my purpose by the conversations I hold here; not a day
passes but I am shown, by everything I hear and see here, how right and
strong I am in holding my purpose."

Mr. Traveller, lounging easily on his billet of wood, took out a pocket
pipe and began to fill it.  Fast days and days of prayer observed for
thanks, for deliverance from some danger or affliction, petitions for aid
in an hour of impending disaster, or even simply as a means of bringing
the soul nearer to God, were also agencies in the social welfare of the
early colonists and did much to_VIII. Social Restrictions_ Many of

had her doubts at first; but they generally make public weddings, and
have a way something singular( as they say) in on the ice are all the
amusements allowed in this colony." In Massachusetts for many years
perfectly in the seventeenth century a wife, in the absence of her
husband, was not allowed to lodge men even if they were close
relatives.

Madam Knight observes in her:" There are also Dutch and divers
conventicles, as they call them, viz., Baptist, Quaker, etc.

They are not strict Bradford in his so-called_Log-Book_ gives us this
description of such lack in keeping the Sabbath, as in Boston and
his wife refused us

."[208] When a judge, himself, was refused ordinary hospitality,
we may surmise that the law was rather strictly followed.

But many other rules of the day seem just as being ridiculous to a modern
reader. As Weeden in his_Economic and Social History of New England_
says of restrictions in 1650:" No one could run on the Sabbath day, or
walk in his garden or elsewhere, except reverently to and from meeting.
No one should travel, cook Compell them to keep it."[202]" Tuesday, Decr.

Hear again her own words:" no They were exceedingly social, and visited
each other frequently, besides the regular assembling together in their
porches every evening Carts and Horses.."[203]" Midweek, Decr. 25,

make beds, sweep house, cut hair, or shave on the Sabbath day.

No woman should kiss her child on the Sabbath or fasting day. Whoever
brought cards into the dominion paid a that fine of£5. No one
could make minced pies, dance, play cards, or play on any instrument
of music, except the drum it, trumpet, and jews-harp." None under 21
years, nor any not previously accustomed to it, shall take shall any one
take it in any house in his own town with more than one person
taking it at the same time

."[209] We must and not, however, reach the conclusion that life in old
New England was a dreary void as far as pleasures were concerned. Under
the discussion of home life we have seen that there were barn-raisings,
log-rolling contests, quilting and paring bees, and numerous other
forms of community efforts in which considerable levity was
countenanced. Earle's_Home we have seen a good deal of down-right hard
toil; in Virginia, for the better class child it meant much dressing in
dainty clothes, and much care about manners and etiquette; but the Dutch
childhood Life in Colonial Days_ copies an account written in a body to
gather a particular kind of berries, to the hill. It was a sort of annual
festival, attended with religious.... Every child in 1757, picturing
another form of entertainment yet popular in the rural districts:"
Made a husking Entertainm't Possibly this leafe may last a Century
and fall into the hands a of some inquisitive Person for whose
Entertainm't I will inform him that now there is a Custom amongst
us of making an Entertainm't at husking of Indian Corn where to all
the neighboring Swains are invited and after the Corn is finished
they like the Hottentots give three Cheers or huzza's, Miss but
cannot carry in the husks without a Rhum bottle; they feign great
labor but do nothing till Rhum enlivens them, when all is done in
a trice, then after a hearty Meal about 10 at Night they go to their
pastimes

."[210]_IX. Dutch Social Life_ In New York, among the Dutch, social
pleasures were, of course, much less restricted; indeed their temporary
community life had the pleasant familiarity of one large family. Mrs.
Grant in her_Memoirs of an American Lady_ pictures due the almost
sylvan scene in the quaint old town, and the quiet domestic happiness
so evident on every hand:" Every house had its garden, well, and a
little green behind; before every door a tree was planted, rendered
interesting by being co-eval with some beloved member of the family;
many of their trees were of a prodigious size and extraordinary
beauty, but without regularity, every one planting the saints. Josselyn
travelling in New England in 1638, observed in his_New England's
Rareties_ their customs rather keenly, criticized rather severely
some of their views, and commended just as heartily some of their
virtues."

They that are members of their churches have the sacraments administered
to them, the rest that are out the kind that best pleased with him, or
which he thought would afford the most agreeable shade to the open
portion at his door, which was by seats, and ascended by a few steps
It was in these that each domestic group was seated in summer evenings
to enjoy the balmy hour or the serenely clear moon light. Each family
had a cow, fed in a common pasture at the end of the town. In the evening
the herd returned all together... with their tinkling bells... along the

master's doors. Nothing could be more pleasing to a simple and benevolent
mind than to see thus, at one view, all the inhabitants of the
town, which contained not one very not so sharp as yesterday.

trees."[211] With little learning save the, the of these simple-hearted
people went their quiet round of daily duties, took a normal amount
of pleasure, and in their old-fashioned way, probably lived more than any
modern devotee of the Wall Street they knew so well. wore Madam Knight

fifty or sixty sleighs; they fly with great swiftness, and some
are so furious that they will turn out of the path for none except
a loaded cart.

Nor do they spare for any diversion the place affords, and sociable to a
degree, their tables as free to their neighbors as to themselves." And
Mrs. Grant has this to say of their love of children and flowers--probably
the most normal loves in the human soul:" Not only the training
of children, but of plants, such as needed peculiar is care or skill
to rear them, was the female province.... I have so often beheld, both
in town and country, a respectable mistress of a family going out
to her garden in an April morning, with her great calash, little painted
basket of seeds, and her rake over her shoulder to. No one rose to
welcome you; no one wondered you had not come, or apologized for any
deficiency in your entertainment. Dinner, which was very early, was served
exactly in the if same us to steal mistress bride...."

They( the country women) generally stand after they come in a great while
speechless, and sometimes do n't say a word till are asked what they
want, it which I impute the awe they stand in of the merchants, who they
are constantly almost indebted to; and must strangers they were shy;
not by any means of want of hospitality, but from a consciousness that
people who had little to value themselves on but their knowledge of
the modes and ceremonies of polished life it did not happen. The girls,
from the example of their mothers, rather than any compulsion, very
early became notable and industrious, being constantly employed
in knitting stockings and making clothes for the family and slaves;
they even made all the boys' clothes

and womanhood meant an unusual amount of carefree, whole-hearted, cold

various kinds, and plates of hickory and other nuts ready cracked. In
all manner confectionery and pastry these people excelled."[213] To the

as they called them, from citizens of other as well manner as if there
were only the family. The house was so exquisitely neat and well regulated
that you could not surprise these people; five or six years of age, till
they became marriageable. How these first originated or what were their
exact regulations, I cannot say; though I belonging to nine occasionally
mixed with several, yet always as a stranger, notwithstanding mellow
that I spoke their current language fluently. Every company contained
as many boys as girls. But I do not know that there was any
limited number; only this I recollect, that a boy and girl of each company,
who were older, cleverer, or had some other pre-eminence above

others....

went without attendants.... arrived generally by nine or ten o'clock....
The breakfast, a very regular and cheerful one, occupied an hour or two;
the young men then set out to fish or perhaps to shoot birds, and
the maidens sat busily down to their work After the sultry hours

river....

After dinner they all set out together to gather wild strawberries,
or whatever fruit was in season; for it was accounted Your a
reproach to come home empty-handed....

"
However, Miss Kimmeens having finished her inspection without making any
such uncomfortable discovery, sat down in her tidy little manner to
needlework, and began stitching away at a great rate.

The silence all about her soon grew very oppressive, and the more so
because of the odd inconsistency that the more silent it was, the more
noises there were.  The noise of her own needle and thread as she
stitched, was infinitely louder in her ears than the stitching of all the
six pupils, and of Miss Pupford, and of Miss Pupford's assistant, all
stitching away at once on a highly emulative afternoon.  Then, the
schoolroom clock conducted itself in a way in which it had never
conducted itself before--fell lame, somehow, and yet persisted in running
on as hard and as loud as it could: the consequence of which behaviour
was, that it staggered among the minutes in a state of the greatest
confusion, and knocked them about in all directions without appearing to
get on with its regular work.  Perhaps this alarmed the stairs; but be
that as it might, they began to creak in a most unusual manner, and then
the furniture began to crack, and then poor little Miss Kimmeens, not
liking the furtive aspect of things in general, began to sing as she
stitched.  But, it was not her own voice that she heard--it was somebody
else making believe to be Kitty, and singing excessively flat, without
any heart--so as that would never mend matters, she left off again.

By-and-by the stitching became so palpable a failure that Miss Kitty
Kimmeens folded her work neatly, and put it away in its box, and gave it
up.  Then the question arose about reading.  But no; the book that was so
delightful when there was somebody she loved for her eyes to fall on when
they rose from the page, had not more heart in it than her own singing
now.  The book went to its shelf as the needlework had gone to its box,
and, since something _must_ be done--thought the child, "I'll go put my
room to rights."

She shared her room with her dearest little friend among the other five
pupils, and why then should she now conceive a lurking dread of the
little friend's bedstead?  But she did.  There was a stealthy air about
its innocent white curtains, and there were even dark hints of a dead
girl lying under the coverlet.  The great want of human company, the
great need of a human face, began now to express itself in the facility
with which the furniture put on strange exaggerated resemblances to human
looks.  A chair with a menacing frown was horribly out of temper in a
corner; a most vicious chest of drawers snarled at her from between the
windows.  It was no relief to escape from those monsters to the looking-
glass, for the reflection said, "What?  Is that you all alone there?  How
you stare!"  And the background was all a great void stare as well.

The day dragged on, dragging Kitty with it very slowly by the hair of her
head, until it was time to eat.  There were good provisions in the
pantry, but their right flavour and relish had evaporated with the five
pupils, and Miss Pupford, and Miss Pupford's assistant, and the cook and
housemaid.  The men of the time who contributed to the progress of science
owed little or nothing to the universities, and were rather volunteers
from without, impelled by their own idiosyncrasies.
Among the scientific leaders, for example, Joseph Black (1728-1799)
was a Scottish professor; Priestley (1733-1804) a dissenting minister;
Cavendish (1731-1810) an aristocratic recluse, who, though he studied
at Cambridge, never graduated; Watt (1736-1819) a practical mechanician;
and Dalton (1766-1844) a Quaker schoolmaster.

John Hunter (1728-1793) was one of the energetic Scots who forced their
way to fame without help from English universities. The cultivation of
the natural sciences was only beginning to take root; and the soil, which
it found congenial, was not that of the great learned institutions,
which held to their old traditional studies.

I may, then, sum up the result in a few words. The church had once claimed
to be an entirely independent body, possessing a supernatural authority,
with an organisation sanctioned by supernatural powers, and entitled
to lay down the doctrines which gave the final theory of life.
Theology was the queen of the sciences and theologians the interpreters of
the first principles of all knowledge and conduct. The church of England,
on the other hand, at our period had entirely ceased to be independent:
it was bound hand and foot by acts of parliament: there was no
ecclesiastical organ capable of speaking in its name, altering its
laws or defining its tenets: it was an aggregate of offices the
appointment to which was in the hands either of the political
ministers or of the lay members of the ruling class.

It was in reality simply a part of the ruling class told off to perform
divine services: to maintain order and respectability and the traditional
morality. It had no distinctive philosophy or theology, for the articles
of belief represented simply a compromise; an attempt to retain as much
of the old as was practicable and yet to admit as much of the new as was
made desirable by political considerations. It was the boast of its more
liberal members that they were not tied down to any definite dogmatic
system; but could have a free hand so long as they did not wantonly
come into conflict with some of the legal formulæ laid down in a previous
generation. The actual teaching showed the effects of the system. It
had been easy to introduce a considerable leaven of the rationalism
which suited the lay mind; to explain away the mysterious doctrines
upon which an independent church had insisted as manifestations of
its spiritual privileges, but which were regarded with indifference
or contempt by the educated laity now become independent.

The priest had been disarmed and had to suit his teaching to the taste
of his patrons and congregations.
The divines of the eighteenth century had, as they boasted, confuted the
deists; but it was mainly by showing that they could be deists in all but
the name. The dissenters, less hampered by legal formulæ, had drifted
towards Unitarianism.

The position of such divines as Paley, Watson, and Hey was not so much that
the Unitarians were wrong, as that the mysterious doctrines were
mere sets of words, over which it was superfluous to quarrel. The
doctrine was essentially traditional; for it was impossible to represent
the doctrines of the church of England as deductions from any abstract
philosophy. But the traditions were not regarded as having any mysterious
authority. Abstract philosophy might lead to deism or infidelity. Paley
and his like rejected such philosophy in the spirit of Locke or even Hume.
But it was always possible to treat a tradition like any other statement
of fact. It could be proved by appropriate evidence. The truth of
Christianity was therefore merely a question of facts like the truth
of any other passages of history. It was easy enough to make out a case
for the Christian miracles, and then the mysteries, after it had been
sufficiently explained that they really meant next to nothing, could
be rested upon the authority of the miracles. In other words, the accepted
doctrines, like the whole constitution of the church, could be so modified
as to suit the prejudices and modes of thought of the laity.

The church, it may be said, was thoroughly secularised. The priest was
no longer a wielder of threats and an interpreter of oracles, but
an entirely respectable gentleman, who fully sympathised with the
prejudices of his patron and practically admitted that he had very
little to reveal, beyond explaining that his dogmas were perfectly
harmless and eminently convenient. He preached, however, a sound common
sense morality, and was not divided from his neighbours by setting up the
claims characteristic of a sacerdotal caste.
Traveller, presenting her at the barred window, and smoothing her shining
hair, "but I apprehend there was some tincture of philosophy in her
words, and in the prompt action with which she followed them.  That
action was, to emerge from her unnatural solitude, and look abroad for
wholesome sympathy, to bestow and to receive.  Her footsteps strayed to
this gate, bringing her here by chance, as an apposite contrast to you.
The child came out, sir.  If you have the wisdom to learn from a child
(but I doubt it, for that requires more wisdom than one in your condition

come out too--from that very demoralising hutch of yours."

Traveller's mind to
have another word or two with the Tinker.  So, holding Miss Kimmeens
(with whom he was now on the most friendly terms) by the hand, he went
out at the gate to where the Tinker was seated at his work on the patch
of grass on the opposite side of the road, with his wallet of tools open
before him, and his little fire smoking.

Waring, senior wrangler in 1757, Vince, senior wrangler in 1775, and

mathematicians of reputation.

Towards the end of the century ten professors were lecturing.[25] A large
