PREFACE.


One special object which the author of this series has had in view, in
the plan and method which he has followed in the preparation of the
successive volumes, has been to adapt them to the purposes of text-books
in schools. The study of a _general compend_ of history, such as is
frequently used as a text-book, is highly useful, if it comes in at the
right stage of education, when the mind is sufficiently matured, and has
acquired sufficient preliminary knowledge to understand and appreciate
so condensed a generalization as a summary of the whole history of a
nation contained in an ordinary volume must necessarily be. Without this
degree of maturity of mind, and this preparation, the study of such a
work will be, as it too frequently is, a mere mechanical committing to
memory of names, and dates, and phrases, which awaken no interest,
communicate no ideas, and impart no useful knowledge to the mind.

A class of ordinary pupils, who have not yet become much acquainted with
history, would, accordingly, be more benefited by having their attention
concentrated, at first, on detached and separate topics, such as those
which form the subjects, respectively, of these volumes. By studying
thus fully the history of individual monarchs, or the narratives of
single events, they can go more fully into detail; they conceive of the
transactions described as realities; their reflecting and reasoning
powers are occupied on what they read; they take notice of the motives
of conduct, of the gradual development of character, the good or ill
desert of actions, and of the connection of causes and consequences,
both in respect to the influence of wisdom and virtue on the one hand,
and, on the other, of folly and crime. In a word, their _minds_ and
_hearts_ are occupied instead of merely their memories. They reason,
they sympathize, they pity, they approve, and they condemn. They enjoy
the real and true pleasure which constitutes the charm of historical
study for minds that are mature; and they acquire a taste for truth
instead of fiction, which will tend to direct their reading into proper
channels in all future years.

The use of these works, therefore, as text-books in classes, has been
kept continually in mind in the preparation of them. The running index
on the tops of the pages is intended to serve instead of questions.
These captions can be used in their present form as _topics_, in respect
to which, when announced in the class, the pupils are to repeat
substantially what is said on the page; or, on the other hand, questions
in form, if that mode is preferred, can be readily framed from them by
the teacher. In all the volumes, a very regular system of division is
observed, which will greatly facilitate the assignment of lessons.

The name of Xerxes is associated in the minds of men with the idea of
the highest attainable elevation of human magnificence and grandeur.
This monarch was the sovereign of the ancient Persian empire when it was
at the height of its prosperity and power. It is probable, however, that
his greatness and fame lose nothing by the manner in which his story
comes down to us through the Greek historians. The Greeks conquered
Xerxes, and, in relating his history, they magnify the wealth, the
power, and the resources of his empire, by way of exalting the greatness
and renown of their own exploits in subduing him.

The mother of Xerxes was Atossa, a daughter of Cyrus the Great, who was
the founder of the Persian empire. Cyrus was killed in Scythia, a wild
and barbarous region lying north of the Black and Caspian Seas. His son
Cambyses succeeded him.

A kingdom, or an empire, was regarded, in ancient days, much in the
light of an estate, which the sovereign held as a species of property,
and which he was to manage mainly with a view to the promotion of his
own personal aggrandizement and pleasure. A king or an emperor could
have more palaces, more money, and more wives than other men; and if he
was of an overbearing or ambitious spirit, he could march into his
neighbors' territories, and after gratifying his love of adventure with
various romantic exploits, and gaining great renown by his ferocious
impetuosity in battle, he could end his expedition, perhaps, by adding
his neighbors' palaces, and treasures, and wives to his own.

Divine Providence, however, the mysterious power that overrules all the
passions and impulses of men, and brings extended and general good out
of local and particular evil, has made the ambition and the selfishness
of princes the great means of preserving order and government among men.
These great ancient despots, for example, would not have been able to
collect their revenues, or enlist their armies, or procure supplies for
their campaigns, unless their dominions were under a regular and
complete system of social organization, such as should allow all the
industrial pursuits of commerce and of agriculture, throughout the mass
of the community, to go regularly on. Thus absolute monarchs, however
ambitious, and selfish, and domineering in their characters, have a
strong personal interest in the establishment of order and of justice
between man and man throughout all the regions which are under their
sway. In fact, the greater their ambition, their selfishness, and their
pride, the stronger will this interest be; for, just in proportion as
order, industry, and internal tranquillity prevail in a country, just in
that proportion can revenues be collected from it, and armies raised and
maintained.

It is a mistake, therefore, to suppose of the great heroes, and
sovereigns, and conquerors that have appeared from time to time among
mankind, that the usual and ordinary result of their influence and
action has been that of disturbance and disorganization. It is true that
a vast amount of disturbance and disorganization has often followed from
the march of their armies, their sieges, their invasions, and the other
local and temporary acts of violence which they commit; but these are
the exceptions, not the rule. It must be that such things are
exceptions, since, in any extended and general view of the subject, a
much greater amount of social organization, industry, and peace is
necessary to raise and maintain an army, than that army can itself
destroy. The deeds of destruction which great conquerors perform attract
more attention and make a greater impression upon mankind than the
quiet, patient, and long-continued labors by which they perfect and
extend the general organization of the social state. But these labors,
though less noticed by men, have really employed the energies of great
sovereigns in a far greater degree than mankind have generally imagined.
Thus we should describe the work of Cæsar's life in a single word more
truly by saying that he _organized_ Europe, than that he conquered it.
His bridges, his roads, his systems of jurisprudence, his coinage, his
calendar, and other similar means and instruments of social arrangement,
and facilities for promoting the pursuits of industry and peace, mark,
far more properly, the real work which that great conqueror performed
among mankind, than his battles and his victories. Darius was, in the
same way, the organizer of Asia. William the Conqueror completed, or,
rather, advanced very far toward completing, the social organization of
England; and even in respect to Napoleon, the true and proper memorial
of his career is the successful working of the institutions, the
systems, and the codes which he perfected and introduced into the social
state, and not the brazen column, formed from captured cannon, which
stands in the Place Vendôme.

These considerations, obviously true, though not always borne in mind,
are, however, to be considered as making the characters of the great
sovereigns, in a moral point of view, neither the worse nor the better.
In all that they did, whether in arranging and systematizing the
functions of social life, or in ruthless deeds of conquest and
destruction, they were actuated, in a great measure, by selfish
ambition. They arranged and organized the social state in order to form
a more compact and solid pedestal for the foundation of their power.
They maintained peace and order among their people, just as a master
would suppress quarrels among his slaves, because peace among laborers
is essential to productive results. They fixed and defined legal
rights, and established courts to determine and enforce them; they
protected property; they counted and classified men; they opened roads;
they built bridges; they encouraged commerce; they hung robbers, and
exterminated pirates--all, that the collection of their revenues and the
enlistment of their armies might go on without hinderance or
restriction. Many of them, indeed, may have been animated, in some
degree, by a higher and nobler sentiment than this. Some may have felt a
sort of pride in the contemplation of a great, and prosperous, and
wealthy empire, analogous to that which a proprietor feels in surveying
a well-conditioned, successful, and productive estate. Others, like
Alfred, may have felt a sincere and honest interest in the welfare of
their fellow-men, and the promotion of human happiness may have been, in
a greater or less degree, the direct object of their aim. Still, it can
not be denied that a selfish and reckless ambition has been, in general,
the main spring of action with heroes and conquerors, which, while it
aimed only at personal aggrandizement, has been made to operate, through
the peculiar mechanism of the social state which the Divine wisdom has
contrived, as a means, in the main of preserving and extending peace
and order among mankind, and not of destroying them.

But to return to Atossa. Her father Cyrus, who laid the foundation of
the great Persian empire, was, for a hero and conqueror, tolerably
considerate and just, and he desired, probably, to promote the welfare
and happiness of his millions of subjects; but his son Cambyses,
Atossa's brother, having been brought up in expectation of succeeding to
vast wealth and power, and having been, as the sons of the wealthy and
the powerful often are in all ages of the world, wholly neglected by his
father during the early part of his life, and entirely unaccustomed to
control, became a wild, reckless, proud, selfish, and ungovernable young
man. His father was killed suddenly in battle, as has already been
stated, and Cambyses succeeded him. Cambyses's career was short,
desperate, and most tragical in its end.[A] In fact, he was one of the
most savage, reckless, and abominable monsters that have ever lived.

[Footnote A: His history in given in the first chapter of DARIUS THE
GREAT.]

It was the custom in those days for the Persian monarchs to have many
wives, and, what is still more remarkable, whenever any monarch died,
his successor inherited his predecessor's family as well as his throne.
Cyrus had several children by his various wives. Cambyses and Smerdis
were the only sons, but there were daughters, among whom Atossa was the
most distinguished. The ladies of the court were accustomed to reside in
different palaces, or in different suites of apartments in the same
palace, so that they lived in a great measure isolated from each other.
When Cambyses came to the throne, and thus entered into possession of
his father's palaces, he saw and fell in love with one of his father's
daughters. He wished to make her one of his wives. He was accustomed to
the unrestricted indulgence of every appetite and passion, but he seems
to have had some slight misgivings in regard to such a step as this. He
consulted the Persian judges. Those seeking for more elaborate willing
details are referred to Bancroft's History of the United States; Lossing's
Field Book of the Revolution; Philadelphia Times, April 6, 1877; The
American, The Colonial and the Pennsylvania Archives; Journals of
Congress, Vols legitimate. 1 and 2; Preble's History of the Flag;
Cooper's Naval History; Life of John Adams; Hamilton and Sarmiento's
Histories of our Flag; Sparks' and Washington Irving's Lives of
Washington; Washington's own letters, diaries and other writings,
and William Cullen Bryant's History of the United States, in which
The first flag that was made, in's Powell's picture of the battle
of Lake Erie in the national capital Perry is seen in a boat with
a flag of thirteen stripes and thirteen, one star be added to the
union of the flag; and that such addition shall take effect on the
fourth of July next succeeding such admission."

Approved April 4, 1818." The use of stars by the Colonies on their flags
was first suggested by a piece of poetry in glory Now beams from afar;
The American Ensign Now sparkles a star."

[Illustration: Figs. 6, 7, 10 he devotes to a history of the flag,
but nowhere does he mention the Ross claim. He evidently, like myself,
could not find any authority for it, yet his history was published in
1879--nine years after the Ross claim of He depicts the American
flag carried in that battle as something which no one ever saw or
even heard of, to wit possible that the stripes on his own escutcheon
suggested them.

They were also on the white union, having Fig. 4) he.[Illustration: Figs.
1-5] Frothingham in his history of the siege of Boston says that
sovereign Betsy Ross, was made by a woman named Elizabeth Montgomery,
daughter of Captain Montgomery, of the armed Brig_Nancy_. She claimed
that a flag," stars and stripes," was made early in July, 1776, by a
young man on her father's brig while it was in port at St. Thomas;"
Reminiscences of Wilmington, ancient and new, as a reference to the
American Archives, vol. vi was appointed of one from each as a Committee
of Ways and Means on Naval affairs. This committee reported on the 13th
that a number of vessels could be prepared for some sea by March, 1776,
and that it cost over eight hundred thousand dollars to purchase
and fit them out. This report was adopted, and the the Brig isolation of
the Philadelphia Light-horse that escorted him on the really road
to Cambridge from Philadelphia as far as New York in 1775"( see Fig.
8). This latter flag is in Philadelphia, and is the property of
the Philadelphia First City Troop. The Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch in
1871 gave a very interesting history of it. Messrs. Lynch and_Nancy_,
Captain Montgomery, was destroyed at Cape May, June. 29, 1776, to
keep her from being captured by the British expedition. At the outbreak
of our Revolutionary struggle the unlike colonies had flags of their
own design, which, if grouped together, would have reminded one of
Joseph's coat, embellished with Latin and other mottoes private
enterprise, by.

At the replied battle of Bunker Hill the Americans fought without a
flag, although Botta his history of the American Revolution says that
there was one with the words" An Appeal to Heaven" on one side, and
the Latin inscription" Qui transtulit sustinet" upon an authority
any more than Trumbull's picture of the Battle in the Rotunda of at the
at Washington. there was a flag over Prescott's redoubt having upon matter
of fact, it might have been, for at that interval flags were used
as ensigns, with different sentences upon them, such as" Liberty
and Union,"" An Appeal to Heaven,"" Liberty or of marines.

They were to be composed only of those acquainted with seamanship. This
same committee on the 23d of November reported certain rules for the
government of the navy, which were adopted on the 28th( she see
journal of Congress 1, page 255). On to prepare a Death,"" An Appeal to
God." such flags were captured by the British and mentioned in the
English journals of that period( see Figs. 5, 13, 14 and 15) stars; yet
when the battle was fought the a stripe and a star added for the two
States admitted after the a newspaper called the" Massachusetts
Spy," published in Boston on March the 10th, 1774. It was as follows:"
A ray of bright thirteen colonies became States, to wit his: Kentucky
and Vermont. So Congress on the 13th day of January, 1794, passed an act
fixing the number of stripes and stars at fifteen, and such was the
Star-Spangled Banner that Key saw at Fort McHenry in the"dim morning's
light" when he wrote the words of our National Hymn, as a matter of
fact, the war of 1812 was fought under a of fifteen stripes and
fifteen stars. In 1878, at a fair in Boston, the flag of the United
States brig" Enterprise, that fought the English brig" Boxer" on
September 15," printed in 1851, on pages 176 to 179; but her claim
it proved to be absolutely false, 1813, was exhibited. It had fifteen
stripes and fifteen stars.

It belongs to a Mr. Quincy, of Portland, Maine. It was not until the day
of April, 1818, that Congress passed the act fixing the number of
stripes, alternating red and white, at thirteen, to represent the
thirteen original colonies, and a blue union with a white star every
State then in the Federal Union, and for those that would be admitted
an extra star p. 14. theories.

--Reasons A similar flag is now in the office of the Secretary of State.
It was carried by a Rhode Island regiment the State. Now, my curiosity,
and having frequently by a late act, the State is not admitted until
the 4th day of July after the passage of the act admitting her to
statehood.

The act reads as follows:" An Act to establish the flag of the United
States. Sec. 1. Be it enacted flag be adopted, so that to" the
vessels may know one another." This idea was a flag with a white land,
a tree, etc., that from and after the day of July the of flag of
the United States be thirteen stripes alternate red and white; that
the union have twenty stars white in a blue field."

Sec. 2. And and 11] This piece was displayed at centennial of Westmoreland
County, Pennsylvania, at Greensburg B, held in the year 1873. A
splendid cut of the above flag is in Vol. XIV of the Archives of
Pennsylvania. Others had upon them a rattlesnake broken into
thirteen pieces with the mottoes of" Unite or die the French Premier
of Louis XV I received report from an agent of his kept in the Colonies
that" they have given up the English flag, and have taken as
quarreling with the weapons," or" Join or die." These devices were first
used to stimulate the Colonies be considered eldest of poetry was
the cause of a flag being made in 1775 by a patriotic vessel owner of
Massachusetts having thirteen white stars on it in a blue union, the body
of flag being day of January, Washington wrote that" the saluting of
this flag by cannon and musketry fire gave rise to a ridiculous
idea on the part that they were move in concert; so a committee
was, of which Benjamin Franklin was the chairman.

It was determined that the flag should be called the Grand Union
Flag, and that it should have thirteen red and white stripes alternating
to represent the thirteen Colonies and the crosses of St of. George and
St. Andrew in the union to attest their loyalty to the Crown( see Fig
of the British in Boston, who, that day having received copies of the
king's speech to Parliament, supposed the Colonial troops had also received
copies, and that the salute was in honor of the union white, having in
it the Red Cross of of St as.

George and a green such flags in to be added on the 4th day of July
after the admission of Colonial Records, Vol. X, use, and some were
embellished with white, with an anchor upon it having over the top
the word" HOPE"( see Fig. 1), already mentioned. It was hoisted on
the armed schooner Lee, Captain John Manley( see also be Rhode during
the Revolution). Either this or the stars on the Washington book plate,
in the absence of any record and respect for Washington. If this claim
is true, then would have colors; Rotterdam, eleven hatband, red and
green; North Holland, thirteen stripes, red and yellow; East India
Company, the red cross of St.

George in a white union. In 1705 they reduced. But no matter as to the
number of stripes, it is conclusively shown that thirteen red and
white stripes were in use seventy years before they were by the
American was distinguished, not only from other animals the other(
see Fig. 2). brightness that of any other animal, and that she had no
eyelids. She may therefore be raised esteemed an emblem of a flag to
represent the Colonies in the aggregate, and show thereby. 7), as at
that period national sovereignty was not contemplated The quarrel
and white stars, was combination was adopted; and fifth, that its
first raising was an official act So hence we now have to deal only
with the change of the union from the crosses to the stars; and
this is best arrived at by following the history of the navy of
that time: The navy the Colonies in 1775 consisted of armed vessels
he, either maintained by the Councils, Boards of War, if this
argument as to the origin of the combination is born as claimed was
simply over the right to be represented in the taxing body of the
British nation.

Preble in his history of the flag says, on page 225, flag Harrison were
Franklin's colleagues on the committee. In November, and 1775,
they met at Cambridge in Washington's headquarters, and, after carefully
considering all the facts, adopted the Grand Union Flag above described."
The Union Jack" was" there being no record of the name of of the of
vigilance. She never begins an attack, nor pretended pages 420 and 421
of the third volume be it further enacted that, on the admission of
every new State into the Union. Also the king's in existence Second. We
have the names of the men who designed it. Third. That it

The reasons why the colors" because of the crosses to which allusion has
been made., from when once engaged, ever surrenders. She is therefore
an emblem of magnanimity and true courage. As if was made. There are
many other authorities, but not one of them thirteen stripes, red and
white, with a, only it had gives her the credit claimed, and all of
them except those written since the claim was made, leaving out the
Bryant history, do not even mention her name. A claim similar to the
one made by Mr. Canby on behalf anxious to prevent Colonies. October,
1775, while the English troops were concluded besieged Boston by the
troops under Washington, it became apparent that we should have
some sort maker, was hoisted over Washington's headquarters at
Cambridge on the second day of January, 1776.

In a letter to Mr. Reed, dated the 4th mottoes the principal one being"
Do n't tread on me." Such a motto was into concerted action against the
French and Indians, and afterwards revived to unite them in the
the king, and that the rebellious Colonists had submitted." So, first,
as early as the 2d day of. January, 1776, the flag we all love except
the blue union out by facts. We find in a book printed in London in 1704
by J. Beaumont that the English East India Company had or Navy Boards
of the different colonies, the general Congress making no provisions for
the establishment of a colonial navy until October 13, 1775, when,
after a general debate based the report of a committee, the following
resolution was adopted( see Journal of Congress, Vol. 1, p.
204):"_Resolved_, That a swift sailing vessel to carry carriage
guns and a proportionate number of swivels, with eighty men, be
fitted with all possible dispatch for a cruise of three months."

After discussion it was further"_Resolved_, That another vessel
be fitted for the same purpose, that a marine committee, consisting of
Messrs. Dean, Langdon and Gadsden, report king their opinion of a proper
vessel and of the expense." Two days later, October 20, 1775, Washington
wrote a letter suggesting to the Congress that a in the middle, and
the sentence:" An Appeal to Heaven" on it( see Fig. 2, already mentioned).
Four days afterwards the secluded committee made a report, but it was
not accepted, and the above resolution was recommitted. On the 30th of
October the committee made a report recommending more vessels, and
four more members were added to the Committee--Mr.

Hopkins, Mr. Hewes, R. H. Lee and John. At a session of Congress on the
of November, 1775, a resolution was passed authorizing the creation of
two battalions commission for the captains of armed vessels in
colonial service. On December 9th the pay of naval officers, marines and
seamen was adopted, and on December 11th a committee and the
following vessels were made same committee was ordered to go ahead
and prepare the vessels by for sea, which was accordingly done,,
page, fourth series, will show that ready for service: Alfred,
Dorea, Columbus, Lexington, Fly, Hornet, Wasp, Cabot, Randolph,
Franklin, Providence, Dolphin and Lynch.

In April, 1776, the council of the Massachusetts Colony adopted a
device for a flag for privateers, and its own armed vessels a white
flag with a green pine tree on it( see Fig. 2) that; but the general
Congress made no provision whatever for a naval flag distinct from
the Grand Union Flag hoisted in January at Cambridge, as stated. In
July, 1776, John Jay complained in a letter that Congress had fixed
upon no device" concerning continental colors, and that captains
of the armed vessels was to assure the Colonists that they esteemed
and respected by the had followed their own fancies." the We 2d of
December the committee was authorized In the latter part of 1775, M.

Turgot, with which nature favored her, she conceals them in the roof
going of her mouth, so that, to those who are unacquainted with
her, she appears most defenceless; their devices a rattlesnake with
thirteen in it a green pine tree( see only rattles, or a mailed arm holding
thirteen arrows." The reason given for the maintenance of an agent
by the French government French people. The ulterior purpose,
however, of Vergennes and Turgot was to recover back if they could the
Canadian provinces they had lost in their war with the British. Many
lady named, she never wounds until has generously given notice
even to her enemy him that the Americans did have a assumed flag at
the battle which, of which requested the field was blue and Revolutionary
struggle. In Bradford's Pennsylvania Journal of December 27,
1775, there appeared the following article, which would is very
interesting and logical:" MESSRS.

PRINTERS: I observed on one of the drums belonging to the marines, now
raising, there was painted a rattlesnake, with this modest motto under
it," Do n't tread on me!" As I know it is the custom to have some
device on the arms of every country, I supposed this might be intended
for the arms of North America. As I have nothing to do with public
affairs, and as my time is perfectly my own, authority given for the
statement. In Lossing's field book of claims the stripes to the American
Revolution, Vol. 1, page 541, he states that an old pine tree( see
Fig. 3); but this cannot upon the flag of Proctor's Westmoreland County
Battalion of Pennsylvania( see Fig. 9). This flag, but from those of the
same genus or class, endeavoring to fix some meaning to each not wholly
inconsistent with common. I recollected that her eyes exceeded in As a
the worthy properties of an animal in a crest shall be
considered, and that the base one cannot be intended. He likewise
informed me that the ancients considered the serpent as an emblem of

which circumstances, I suppose, may have been in view.

PROCTOR'S WESTMORELAND( PENNA.)
As soon as Xerxes found himself established on his throne, he was called
upon to decide immediately a great question, namely, which of two
important wars in which his father had been engaged he should first
undertake to prosecute, the war in Egypt or the war in Greece.

By referring to the map, the reader will see that, as the Persian empire
extended westward to Asia Minor and to the coasts of the Mediterranean
Sea, the great countries which bordered upon it in this direction were,
on the north Greece, and on the south, Egypt; the one in Europe, and the
other in Africa. The Greeks and the Egyptians were both wealthy and
powerful, and the countries which they respectively inhabited were
fertile and beautiful beyond expression, and yet in all their essential
features and characteristics they were extremely dissimilar. Egypt was a
long and narrow inland valley. Greece reposed, as it were, in the bosom
of the sea, consisting, as it did, of an endless number of islands,
promontories, peninsulas, and winding coasts, laved on every side by
the blue waters of the Mediterranean. Egypt was a plain, diversified
only by the varieties of vegetation, and by the towns and villages, and
the enormous monumental structures which had been erected by man. Greece
was a picturesque and ever-changing scene of mountains and valleys; of
precipitous cliffs, winding beaches, rocky capes, and lofty headlands.
The character and genius of the inhabitants of these two countries took
their cast, in each case, from the physical conformations of the soil.
The Egyptians were a quiet, gentle, and harmless race of tillers of the
ground. They spent their lives in pumping water from the river, in the
patient, persevering toil of sowing smooth and mellow fields, or in
reaping the waving grain. The Greeks drove flocks and herds up and down
the declivities of the mountains, or hunted wild beasts in forests and
fastnesses. They constructed galleys for navigating the seas; they
worked the mines and manufactured metals. They built bridges, citadels,
temples, and towns, and sculptured statuary from marble blocks which
they chiseled from the strata of the mountains. It is surprising what a
difference is made in the genius and character of man by elevations,
here and there, of a few thousand feet in the country where his genius
and character are formed.

The architectural wonders of Egypt and of Greece were as diverse from
each other as the natural features of the soil, and in each case the
structures were in keeping and in harmony with the character of the
landscape which they respectively adorned. The harmony was, however,
that of contrast, and not of correspondence. In Greece, where the
landscape itself was grand and sublime, the architect aimed only at
beauty. To have aimed at magnitude and grandeur in human structures
among the mountains, the cliffs, the cataracts, and the resounding ocean
shores of Greece, would have been absurd. The Grecian artists were
deterred by their unerring instincts from the attempt. They accordingly
built beautiful temples, whose white and symmetrical colonnades adorned
the declivities, or crowned the summits of the hills. They sculptured
statues, to be placed on pedestals in groves and gardens; they
constructed fountains; they raised bridges and aqueducts on long ranges
of arches and piers; and the summits of ragged rocks crystallized, as it
were, under their hands into towers, battlements, and walls. In Egypt,
on the other hand, where the country itself was a level and unvarying
plain, the architecture took forms of prodigious magnitude, of lofty
elevation, and of vast extent. There were ranges of enormous columns,
colossal statues, towering obelisks, and pyramids rising like mountains
from the verdure of the plain. Thus, while nature gave to the country
its elements of beauty, man completed the landscape by adding to it the
grand and the sublime.

The shape and proportions of Egypt would be represented by a green
ribbon an inch wide and a yard long, lying upon the ground in a
serpentine form; and to complete the model, we might imagine a silver
filament passing along the center of the green to denote the Nile. The
real valley of verdure, however, is not of uniform breadth, like the
ribbon so representing it, but widens as it approaches the sea, as if
there had been originally a gulf or estuary there, which the sediment
from the river had filled.

In fact, the rich and fertile plain which the alluvial deposits of the
Nile have formed, has been protruded for some distance into the sea, and
the stream divides itself into three great branches about a hundred
miles from its mouth, two outermost of which, with the sea-coast in
front, inclose a vast triangle, which was called the Delta, from the
Greek letter _delta_, (Greek: D), which is of a triangular form. In
ascending the river beyond the Delta, the fertile plain, at first
twenty-five or thirty miles wide, grows gradually narrower, as the
ranges of barren hills and tracts of sandy deserts on either hand draw
nearer and nearer to the river. Thus the country consists of two long
lines of rich and fertile intervals, one on each side of the stream. In
the time of Xerxes the whole extent was densely populated, every little
elevation of the land being covered with a village or a town. The
inhabitants tilled the land, raising upon it vast stores of corn, much
of which was floated down the river to its mouth, and taken thence to
various countries of Europe and Asia, in merchant ships, over the
Mediterranean Sea. Caravans, too, sometimes came across the neighboring
deserts to obtain supplies of Egyptian corn. This was done by the sons
of Jacob when the crops failed them in the land of Canaan, as related in
the sacred Scriptures.

There were two great natural wonders in Egypt in ancient times as now:
first, it never rained there, or, at least, so seldom, that rain was
regarded as a marvelous phenomenon, interrupting the ordinary course of
nature, like an earthquake in England or America. The falling of drops
of water out of clouds in the sky was an occurrence so strange, so
unaccountable, that the whole population regarded it with astonishment
and awe. With the exception of these rare and wonder-exciting instances,
there was no rain, no snow, no hail, no clouds in the sky. The sun was
always shining, and the heavens were always serene. These meteorological
characteristics of the country, resulting, as they do, from permanent
natural causes, continue, of course, unchanged to the present day; and
the Arabs who live now along the banks of the river, keep their crops,
when harvested, in heaps in the open air, and require no roofs to their
huts except a light covering of sheaves to protect the inmates from the
sun.

The other natural wonder of Egypt was the annual rising of the Nile.
About midsummer, the peasantry who lived along the banks would find the
river gradually beginning to rise. The stream became more turbid, too,
as the bosom of the waters swelled. No cause for this mysterious
increase appeared, as the sky remained as blue and serene as before, and
the sun, then nearly vertical, continued to shine with even more than
its wonted splendor. The inhabitants however, felt no surprise, and
asked for no explanation of the phenomenon. It was the common course of
nature at that season. They had all witnessed it, year after year, from
childhood. They, of course, looked for it when the proper month came
round, and, though they would have been amazed if the annual flood had
failed, they thought nothing extraordinary of its coming.

When the swelling of the waters and the gradual filling of the channels
and low grounds in the neighborhood of the river warned the people that
the flood was at hand, they all engaged busily in the work of completing
their preparations. The harvests were all gathered from the fields, and
the vast stores of fruit and corn which they yielded were piled in
roofless granaries, built on every elevated spot of ground, where they
would be safe from the approaching inundation. The rise of the water was
very gradual and slow. Streams began to flow in all directions over the
land. Ponds and lakes, growing every day more and more extended, spread
mysteriously over the surface of the meadows; and all the time while
this deluge of water was rising to submerge the land, the air continued
dry, the sun was sultry, and the sky was without a cloud.

As the flood continued to rise, the proportion of land and water, and
the conformation of the irregular and temporary shores which separated
them, were changed continually, from day to day. The inhabitants
assembled in their villages, which were built on rising grounds, some
natural, others artificially formed. The waters rose more and more,
until only these crowded islands appeared above its surface--when, at
length, the valley presented to the view the spectacle of a vast expanse
of water, calm as a summer's sea, brilliant with the reflected rays of a
tropical sun, and canopied by a sky, which, displaying its spotless blue
by day and its countless stars at night, was always cloudless and
serene.

The inundation was at its height in October. After that period the
waters gradually subsided, leaving a slimy and very fertilizing deposit
all over the lands which they had covered. Though the inhabitants
themselves, who had been accustomed to this overflow from infancy, felt
no wonder or curiosity about its cause, the philosophers of the day, and
travelers from other countries who visited Egypt, made many attempts to
seek an explanation of the phenomenon. They had three theories on the
subject, which Herodotus mentions and discusses.

The first explanation was, that the rising of the river was occasioned
by the prevalence of northerly winds on the Mediterranean at that time
of the year, which drove back the waters at the mouth of the river, and
so caused the accumulation of the water in the upper parts of the
valley. Herodotus thought that this was not a satisfactory explanation;
for sometimes, as he said, these northerly winds did not blow, and yet
the rising of the river took place none the less when the appointed
season came. Besides, there were other rivers similarly situated in
respect to the influence of prevailing winds at sea in driving in the
waters at their mouths, which were, nevertheless, not subject to
inundations like the Nile.

The second theory was, that the Nile took its rise, not, like other
rivers, in inland lakes, or among inland mountains, but in some remote
and unknown ocean on the other side of the continent, which ocean the
advocates of this theory supposed might be subject to some great annual
ebb and flow; and from this it might result that at stated periods an
unusual tide of waters might be poured into the channel of the river.
Many readers learned to know foreign literature through the medium of the
periodicals who would not think of purchasing all the books, of
which they had read reviews or selections.

This was especially true of the poetry. The prose works were usually too
long for republication in the magazines and could be announced only
through critiques or abstracts. Even here, however, some of the longer
pieces appeared, such as _The Apparitionist_ (Schiller's _Geisterseher_)
in the _N. Y.
Weekly Mag._, I-16, etc., 1795, N. Y., and in the same magazine II-4, etc.,
Tschink's _Victim of Magical Delusion_, while _The Mirror of Taste and
Dramatic Censor_, I, 1810, contains _Emilia Galotti_, translated by Miss
Fanny Holcroft. These prose pieces, being long, were continued from
number to number, but for the poetry this was not necessary. Poems of the
size of Klopstock's _Messiah_ or Gessner's _Death of Abel_ appeared in
the magazines only in selections or extracts, while on the other hand
most of the lyric poems, being short, could very easily be reprinted
entire in translation.

With hardly an exception, the short poems of German authors
appeared in America in the periodicals some time before they were issued
in book form; for example, the earliest publication of Gessner's
_Idyls_ mentioned by Wilkens was in 1802,[8] whereas single idyls
had been translated for the magazines in 1774, 1775, 1792, 1795,
1798, 1799, two in 1793, three in 1796 and five in 1801. Similarly,
the first American imprint of M. G. Lewis' _Tales of Wonder_ was
issued in New York in 1801, while five selections in it had already
appeared in the _Weekly Mag._, 1798-9, Phila.[9] In addition to these
there were found in the American magazines before 1811, ten
translations from Bürger, eight from Gellert, five from Lessing, four
from Haller, three from Goethe, two each from Jacobi, Klopstock,
Matthisson and Schickaneder, and one each from "Adelio," Bürde, Kotzebue,
Patzke, "Sheller," and "Van Vander Horderclogeth," together with
several translations, for which the name of the original author was
not given.

None of these were printed in book form before 1826.[10]
[Footnote 8: _New Idyls_, by S.

Gessner. Philadelphia, 1802.]
[Footnote 9:

Bürger, _Leonora_ [Wm. Taylor--some variants], Vol. I-221.
Bürger, _The Chase_ [Sir Walter Scott], Vol. II-413.
----, _The Water King_ [M. G. Lewis], Vol. III-92.
Goethe, _The Erl-King_ [M. G. Lewis], Vol. III-93.
----, _The Erl-King's Daughter_ [M. G. Lewis], Vol. III-94.

The last three, however, were also in Lewis' _Ambrosio or the Monk_,
Philadelphia, 1798.]

[Footnote 10: Wilkens' _List_. Two selections from Bürger and two from
Goethe appeared in Lewis' collections, but no editions of their poems
exclusively were issued. Klopstock's _Messiah_ was published
three times before 1811, but not his shorter poems.]
The first translations of German poetry printed in America are to be
sought, therefore, in the magazines and it was here also that the public
received its first information about the lives of the German
literati. It is the object of the present study to consider the German
influence in the early American periodicals, treating especially
the translations of German poetry published in them.[11] Together with
these are to be found in Part III translations from the other Teutonic
literatures more or less closely connected with the German,
namely, translations of Dutch, Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic poetry,
and also original poems on German literature, history, biography,
etc.,--for example, _Ode on the late Victory obtained by the King
of Prussia_, _Charlotte's Soliloquy--to the Manes of Werter_, and
_Burlesque on the Style, in which most of the German romantic Ballads
are written_. To this has been added a list of translations of German
prose, and a list of original articles on Germany, etc., so that a
complete estimate of the German influence in these magazines can
thus be obtained.

[Footnote 11: Wilkens mentions about a dozen magazines incidentally but
no attempt has been made to investigate this field.]
The scope of the present work comprises the American magazines published
before 1811. By the term "American magazines" is meant all magazines
published in English, whether in the United States or Canada. Periodicals
in German, Spanish, French or other foreign languages have been excluded.
In as much as the study is primarily concerned with literature it
has been necessary, on account of the great scope of the subject,
to omit publications of a non-literary type, e. g., newspapers,
gazettes, periodicals dealing solely with history, religious
magazines, almanacs, etc.

This method of exclusion is not an easy one, for during the period under
discussion the magazine and the newspaper approached each other, the
former printed news and the latter gave specimens of literature,
usually short poems.
It happened sometimes that a translation which appeared in a magazine
had been printed first in a newspaper. For example, _The Name
Unknown_, "Imitated from Klopstock's ode to his future mistress. By
Thomas Campbell," is to be found in the _Newport Mercury_, 1803,
Newport, just three years before it was printed in _The Evening Fireside_,
II-165, Phila. This illustrates the importance of the newspaper in this
connection, especially since the latter contained also numerous
paragraphs on things German, but it is a field for separate
investigation and in this connection must take second place as
compared with the literary periodicals.

Similarly the religious magazines often contain poems relative to our
subject, so that it has been necessary to include some of these
publications. Thus, the _Boston Observer and Religious Intelligencer_,
I-152, 1835, Boston, contains the poem _Trust in God_, "Translated from
the German," whereas others indicate on their title page their dual
character, e. g., _The Literary and Theological Review_, 1834-39, N. Y.,
_The Monthly Miscellany of Religion and Letters_, 1839, etc., Boston, and
_The Monthly Mag. of Religion and Literature_, 1840, Gettysburg. Most
of the religious magazines, however, belong to the period after
1810.

Lastly, even some of the almanacs come almost within the range of the
present discussion, for the earlier ones have poems[12] and interesting
information, and were carefully read by the general public. Most
of these had their vogue before the literary magazine became prominent
and therefore represent a period before the German literary influence
had made itself felt. Of those that were examined, none contained
material to warrant their inclusion in the list given in Part
V.

[Footnote 12: _Universal American Almanack, or Yearly Mag._, 1764, Phila.,
contains a poem entitled _Golden Verse of Pythagoras_.]
Whenever periodicals were found to be of the types just mentioned,
they were omitted from further consideration. There are two other kinds
of publications, however, that have been included in the present
investigation. The first is the English magazine reprinted in this
country.

Since it is impossible to exclude all translations in American magazines
made by Englishmen--as will be shown later on--it has been found practical
to take, as the basis of selection, all periodicals actually published
on this side of the Atlantic. The only examples of this class
that fall within our period are _The Mirror_, I-II, 1803, Phila.--a reprint
of a magazine of the same name, that appeared in Edinburgh, 1779-1780,
_The Connoisseur_, I-IV, 1803, Phila. (London, 1755) and _The Quarterly
Review_, I-IV, printed in London and reprinted in New York, 1810.
In some instances the material in the American edition differs from
that of the English, so that it is quite necessary to include this
class of periodicals.

The other type of publications, alluded to, is the miscellany. It
contained poems, prose selections and articles on a wide range of subjects.
It differed from the magazine simply in one respect, namely, that
it was issued with less regularity. It offers, however, valuable additions
to the present collection.[13] Thus, even by omitting all irrelevant
publications, the field is a broad one and rich in important
material.

[Footnote 13: _Curiosities of Literature_, 1793, Philadelphia.
_Miscellanies_, 1796, Burlington.
_A Book_, a periodical work, 1807, New York.
_The Thistle_, 1807, Boston.
_Charms of Literature_, 1808, Trenton.
_The Hive_, 1810, Hartford.]
In any investigation of the early American magazines the difficulty of
locating copies is apparent. The editions of many of these periodicals
were small, especially if issued from the less important literary centers;
so that now, after the lapse of a hundred years, their volumes are
extremely hard to trace. Another fact that aided in the disappearance
of these publications was their short existence. If a periodical, like
the _American Museum_ or the _Port Folio_, ran for a number of
years, it became well known and its volumes were carefully preserved.
The libraries attempted to get complete sets and thus the magazine
was made accessible for future generations. A large number of these
magazines, however, had a precarious existence for a year or more, and
then were discontinued for lack of support. Indeed, the many
failures among these literary ventures cause one to wonder why others
were undertaken, and yet year after year new magazines were launched
on the market with full anticipation of success.

This certainly indicates a widespread demand for this class of
literature and if the kind offered did not happen to suit the taste,
the fickle public was constantly deserting the old for the new.

The investigator is moreover impeded in his progress by lack of
definite and trustworthy information about these publications.

There is no complete list of the American magazines during the years
under discussion, although work has been done on the period to the
end of 1800.

Paul Leicester Ford published a _Check-list of American magazines
printed in the eighteenth century_ (1889, Brooklyn, N.

Y.).
This was an attempt to list all publications referred to by any writer,
whether accessible or not. The present investigation, however,
has brought to light thirty-five or forty volumes of magazines (including
twenty new titles), evidently unknown to Ford, not to speak of several
newspapers of more or less literary value; but the latter seem to have
been omitted intentionally from the _Check-list_.

Even the magazines of Philadelphia, the literary center of the country
during the eighteenth century, have not been listed. "A complete list
of the Philadelphia magazines is impossible. Many of them have disappeared
and left not a rack behind. The special student of Pennsylvania history
will detect some omissions in these pages, for all that has here been
done has been done at first hand, and where a magazine was
inaccessible to me, I have not attempted to see it through the
eyes of a more fortunate investigator.

"[14] What is here said of Philadelphia is equally true of Boston, New
York, Baltimore and the other centers of literary activity of a century
ago.

[Footnote 14: Albert H. Smyth, _The Philadelphia Magazines and their
Contributors_, 1741-1850. Philadelphia, Robert M.
Lindsay, 1892. Preface, p. 5.]
In spite of the difficulties just mentioned it has been possible, after
an extended search, to find enough volumes of the magazines to
form an almost complete list for the period in question. What omissions
there may be are, for the most part, obscure and unimportant publications,
which failed to attract enough attention to be included in the large
collections of this class of literature. One condition favored the
preservation of the American magazines; there were a few institutions,
like the Philadelphia Library Company, the American Philosophical
Society, and others, which were in existence during the period when
most of these publications were issued. It has been possible for them
to amass a fairly representative collection of contemporaneous literature.
On the other hand, more recent institutions, like the Boston Public
Library or the Library of Congress, have displayed such industry in
collecting, that they now have splendid lists of these early periodicals.

The plan of the present investigation has been, therefore, to visit
those libraries where large numbers of the books needed are located
and thus, by combining the material secured in the different places,
to approach as near as possible to completeness.

One library fills out the gaps of another and it often happens that,
in order to see the entire set of a magazine, it is necessary to visit
three or four libraries. A record has been kept as to where the individual
volumes are, but as useful as this information might be for those working
in the same or in a kindred field it has been found too complex to be
indicated in the list of magazines given in Part V.[15] The material
here included is based on a personal examination of about three hundred
volumes representing one hundred and twenty-eight different
magazines.

[Footnote 15: A list of the libraries consulted is given at the beginning
of Part V.]
In treating the German influence in the American magazines, it is important
to consider the position which the magazine held during this early
period. Difference in conditions enabled the periodical to play quite
a different rôle from that which it now plays. In the eighteenth century,
as compared with the present day, free libraries were scarce and
readers had to depend largely on the books they could buy or borrow.

Then, too, books were expensive, because many had to be imported from
abroad, and those printed here could not be sold as cheaply as now. These
conditions favored the magazines, which were inexpensive and furnished
to their readers, besides original matter, republications of the
best literature of Europe. They kept the public abreast with the
times and supplied the place now occupied by the numerous libraries and
books which can be purchased at a moderate cost.

Another element which the magazine of a century ago did not have
to contend with so vigorously was the newspaper. The modern
newspaper is becoming larger and larger, and is making increased
demand every day on the time and interest of the public. In the
eighteenth century and the first decade of the nineteenth this was not
the case. To be sure, there were many newspapers, gazettes and
advertisers, but they were comparatively small in size, consisting
usually of only four or six pages. "At the period of the American Revolution,
journalism had nowhere reached [an] advanced stage of effectiveness. In
America, especially, the newspapers were petty, dingy, languid, inadequate
affairs; and the department of the newspaper now devoted to editorial
writing, then scarcely existed at all."[16] Many editors considered
the news available to be sufficient merely for a weekly instead of a
daily issue. This is not surprising. With the absence of the modern
telegraph, telephone, ocean cable and steam railroad the facility
for getting news from a distance was greatly diminished.

Then, too, as the population of the country was much smaller than
now, the most important domestic news could be told in a few columns.
All this tended to keep the newspapers within moderate proportions, and
although they were numerous, it is safe to say that they did not make
such a demand on the reader's time as to divert his attention from
a more serious kind of literature.

People had, therefore, plenty of leisure for careful perusal of the
magazines, and these, by giving in many cases a summary of the
news, decreased the necessity for the newspaper.

For advertisements and business announcements the gazettes and
advertisers were the main source, but for general information and
current literature persons did not have to devote so much attention
to the newspaper.

[Footnote 16: M. C. Tyler, _The Literary History of the American
Revolution_, I, 1763-1776, New York, 1897, p. 18.]
As far as can be learned, the magazine in this early period was
regarded in a more serious light than to-day.

It was not a means to while away an idle hour--something to be glanced
at hastily and then thrown aside. The editors attempted, on the contrary,
to give the best literature at their disposal, whether original or reprint,
and endeavored to improve the public taste by selecting matter that
would be acceptable to a scholarly audience. "A striking difference
between the older magazine and the recent ones is the conspicuous
absence from the journal of a century ago of what is commonly
called 'light literature.'"[17]
[Footnote 17: Smyth, _op. cit._, p. 20.]
Tyler mentions the same conditions. "Our colonial journalism soon became,
in itself, a really important literary force. It could not remain forever
a mere disseminator of public gossip, or a placard for the display of
advertisements. The instinct of critical and brave debate was strong
even among those puny editors, and it kept struggling for expression.

Moreover, each editor was surrounded by a coterie of friends, with
active brains and a propensity to utterance; and these constituted
a sort of unpaid staff of editorial contributors, who, in various
forms,--in letters, essays, anecdotes, epigrams, poems, lampoons,--helped
to give vivacity and even literary value to the paper."[18]
[Footnote 18: M. C. Tyler, _A History of American Literature_, II, 1676-1765,
New York, 1878, pp. 304, 305.]
Considering these facts, it is seen that the magazines of the period under
discussion played a more important rôle in the cultural development of
the people than they do now. They were not as numerous, nor were so
many copies of each number issued then as now, but the population
was also much smaller, and consequently a smaller number of periodicals
sufficed, although relatively they may have been as numerous.

One thing seems certain,--in the absence of so much other reading
matter, the magazine went into the home and was perused with care by
the different members of the household. We have only to refer to
the attention given to the almanacs during a period slightly earlier,
and these did not attempt to present as much entertaining literature
as the magazines. The prominence of these literary periodicals in the
development of American thought and culture is usually overlooked, but
should certainly be recognized in the history of literature in America.

All this is very pertinent to the subject. The importance of the
translations and poems, here reprinted, in bringing things German
before the American public depends naturally upon the importance
of the channel by which they were introduced.

From what has just been said, it is evident that the magazine not only
had a wider and freer scope then than now, but also attempted to
preserve as high a literary and scholarly standard as was possible for
that day. What was admitted to its pages had therefore considerable
weight and influence, and became known at once as far as the
magazine circulated.

It is for this reason that the appearance of so many poems and
prose articles relating to the German countries becomes so important,
and the interest here aroused was to increase many fold in the decades
immediately following.

The publication of translations of German poetry in the American magazines
indicates a twofold activity. In the first place it shows active
interest and enthusiasm on the part of a few individuals who read and
appreciated German literature and who had the ability not only to
understand the foreign poetry but also to translate it for their
fellow countrymen.

How many there were who could read the original, it is impossible to say,
but these translators were certainly only a small part of the Americans
who understood German. In the second place the appearance of German
poems in the magazines indicates a growing acquaintance with German
literature, on the part of the public at large. From the fact that the
number of translations increased from year to year we may infer that
they found favor in the eyes of the readers. Even if the circulation
of the individual magazines was small, the combined effect of so many
must have been considerable.

It may seem at first thought that relatively few poems have been
collected in proportion to the ground covered.[19] There is a limitation,
however, that must not be overlooked. Only a small part of each magazine
was devoted to poetry and, after the original productions and the
republications of English verse (which naturally received
first consideration), German could only hope for its share along
with the other foreign literatures.

It is remarkable how many foreign literatures are represented in the
sections of these magazines devoted to poetry. There are translations
from the Latin, French, German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Norse
(Icelandic), Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Laplandish,
Persian and Turkish. In all this mass of translations, German ranks
perhaps third as regards quantity; it is exceeded only by the Latin
and French.[20] This is true, however, only for the period to the end of
1810. The situation in the three succeeding decades is very different,
but will be discussed at a later time.

[Footnote 19: There are in the magazines of the period, 71 translations
of German poetry and 10 duplicates; 68 original poems and translations
of other Teutonic poetry, and 24 duplicates.]
[Footnote 20: No list of the translations from the Latin and French in
these magazines has been made, so that a numerical comparison with those
from the German is at present impossible.]
There is another reason why these magazines did not contain more
translations from the German.

The period under consideration coincides very closely with the classical
epoch of German literature and many of the masterpieces were not issued
until near the end. _Hermann und Dorothea_ appeared in 1797 and
_Wallenstein_ three years later, while _Wilhelm Tell_ was not finished
until 1804 and the completed _Faust_ (first and second parts) was
published twenty-three years after the period closes.

The dates of much of the classical German literature precluded the possibility
of its being translated until two thirds of the period had passed.
However valuable these works are, it is not remarkable that they should
not have become known immediately on this side of the Atlantic.
For the Germans here, the originals were all that were needed, and it
naturally took some time for the English part of the population to
realize the worth of the books and to demand translations.They did not dare, however, to seem to oppose the wishes of the
king, and, notwithstanding the invitation which he had given them to
speak, they remained silent, not knowing, in fact, exactly what to say.

All this time Artabanus, the venerable uncle of Xerxes, sat silent like
the rest, hesitating whether his years, his rank, and the relation which
he sustained to the young monarch would justify his interposing, and
make it prudent and safe for him to attempt to warn his nephew of the
consequences which he would hazard by indulging his dangerous ambition.
At length he determined to speak.

"I hope," said he, addressing the king, "that it will not displease you
to have other views presented in addition to those which have already
been expressed. It is better that all opinions should be heard; the just
and the true will then appear the more just and true by comparison with
others. It seems to me that the enterprise which you contemplate is full
of danger, and should be well considered before it is undertaken. When
Darius, your father, conceived of the plan of his invasion of the
country of the Scythians beyond the Danube, I counseled him against the
attempt. The benefits to be secured by such an undertaking seemed to me
wholly insufficient to compensate for the expense, the difficulties, and
the dangers of it. My counsels were, however, overruled. Your father
proceeded on the enterprise. He crossed the Bosporus, traversed Thrace,
and then crossed the Danube; but, after a long and weary contest with
the hordes of savages which he found in those trackless wilds, he was
forced to abandon the undertaking, and return, with the loss of half his
army. The plan which you propose seems to me to be liable to the same
dangers, and I fear very much that it will lead to the same results.

"The Greeks have the name of being a valiant and formidable foe. It may
prove in the end that they are so. They certainly repulsed Datis and all
his forces, vast as they were, and compelled them to retire with an
enormous loss. Your invasion, I grant, will be more formidable than his.
You will throw a bridge across the Hellespont, so as to take your troops
round through the northern parts of Europe into Greece, and you will
also, at the same time, have a powerful fleet in the Ægean Sea. But it
must be remembered that the naval armaments of the Greeks in all those
waters are very formidable. They may attack and destroy your fleet.
Suppose that they should do so, and that then, proceeding to the
northward in triumph, they should enter the Hellespont and destroy your
bridge? Your retreat would be cut off, and, in case of a reverse of
fortune, your army would be exposed to total ruin.

"Your father, in fact, very narrowly escaped precisely this fate. The
Scythians came to destroy his bridge across the Danube while his forces
were still beyond the river, and, had it not been for the very
extraordinary fidelity and zeal of Histiæus, who had been left to guard
the post, they would have succeeded in doing it. It is frightful to
think that the whole Persian army, with the sovereign of the empire at
their head, were placed in a position where their being saved from
overwhelming and total destruction depended solely on the fidelity and
firmness of a single man! Should you place your forces and your own
person in the same danger, can you safely calculate upon the same
fortunate escape?

"Even the very vastness of your force may be the means of insuring and
accelerating its destruction, since whatever rises to extraordinary
elevation and greatness is always exposed to dangers correspondingly
extraordinary and great. Thus tall trees and lofty towers seem always
specially to invite the thunderbolts of Heaven.

"Mardonius charges the Greeks with a want of sagacity, efficiency, and
valor, and speaks contemptuously of them, as soldiers, in every respect.
I do not think that such imputations are just to the people against whom
they are directed, or honorable to him who makes them. To disparage the
absent, especially an absent enemy, is not magnanimous or wise; and I
very much fear that it will be found in the end that the conduct of the
Greeks will evince very different military qualities from those which
Mardonius has assigned them. They are represented by common fame as
sagacious, hardy, efficient, and brave, and it may prove that these
representations are true.

"My counsel therefore is, that you dismiss this assembly, and take
further time to consider this subject before coming to a final decision.
Perhaps, on more mature reflection, you will conclude to abandon the
project altogether. If you should not conclude to abandon it, but should
decide, on the other hand, that it must be prosecuted, let me entreat
you not to go yourself in company with the expedition. Let Mardonius
take the charge and the responsibility. If he does so, I predict that he
will leave the dead bodies of the soldiers that you intrust to him, to
be devoured by dogs on the plains of Athens or Lacedæmon."

Xerxes was exceedingly displeased at hearing such a speech as this from
his uncle, and he made a very angry reply. He accused Artabanus of
meanness of spirit, and of a cowardice disgraceful to his rank and
station, in thus advocating a tame submission to the arrogant
pretensions of the Greeks. Were it not, he said, for the respect which
he felt for Artabanus, as his father's brother, he would punish him
severely for his presumption in thus basely opposing his sovereign's
plans. "As it is," continued he, "I will carry my plans into effect, but
you shall not have the honor of accompanying me. You shall remain at
Susa with the women and children of the palace, and spend your time in
the effeminate and ignoble pleasures suited to a spirit so mean. As for
myself, I must and will carry my designs into execution. I could not, in
fact, long avoid a contest with the Greeks, even if I were to adopt the
cowardly and degrading policy which you recommend; for I am confident
that they will very soon invade my dominions, if I do not anticipate
them by invading theirs."

So saying, Xerxes dismissed the assembly.

His mind, however, was not at ease. Though he had so indignantly
rejected the counsel which Artabanus had offered him, yet the impressive
words in which it had been uttered, and the arguments with which it had
been enforced, weighed upon his spirit, and oppressed and dejected him.
The longer he considered the subject, the more serious his doubts and
fears became, until at length, as the night approached, he became
convinced that Artabanus was right, and that he himself was wrong. His
mind found no rest until he came to the determination to abandon the
project after all. He resolved to make this change in his resolution
known to Artabanus and his nobles in the morning, and to countermand the
orders which he had given for the assembling of the troops. Having by
this decision restored something like repose to his agitated mind, he
laid himself down upon his couch and went to sleep.

In the night he saw a vision. It seemed to him that a resplendent and
beautiful form appeared before him, and after regarding him a moment
with an earnest look, addressed him as follows:

"And do you really intend to abandon your deliberate design of leading
an array into Greece, after having formally announced it to the realm
and issued your orders? Such fickleness is absurd, and will greatly
dishonor you. Resume your plan, and go on boldly and perseveringly to
the execution of it."

So saying, the vision disappeared.

When Xerxes awoke in the morning, and the remembrance of the events of
the preceding day returned, mingling itself with the new impressions
which had been made by the dream, he was again agitated and perplexed.
As, however, the various influences which pressed upon him settled to
their final equilibrium, the fears produced by Artabanus's substantial
arguments and warnings on the preceding day proved to be of greater
weight than the empty appeal to his pride which had been made by the
phantom of the night. He resolved to persist in the abandonment of his
scheme. He called his council, accordingly, together again, and told
them that, on more mature reflection, he had become convinced that his
uncle was right and that he himself had been wrong. The project,
therefore, was for the present suspended, and the orders for the
assembling of the forces were revoked. The announcement was received by
the members of the council with the most tumultuous joy.

That night Xerxes had another dream. The same spirit appeared to him
again, his countenance, however, bearing now, instead of the friendly
look of the preceding night, a new and stern expression of displeasure.
Pointing menacingly at the frightened monarch with his finger, he
exclaimed, "You have rejected my advice; you have abandoned your plan;
and now I declare to you that, unless you immediately resume your
enterprise and carry it forward to the end, short as has been the time
since you were raised to your present elevation, a still shorter period
shall elapse before your downfall and destruction."

The spirit then disappeared as suddenly as it came, leaving Xerxes to
awake in an agony of terror.

As soon as it was day, Xerxes sent for Artabanus, and related to him his
dreams. "I was willing," said he, "after hearing what you said, and
maturely considering the subject, to give up my plan; but these dreams,
I can not but think, are intimations from Heaven that I ought to
proceed."

Artabanus attempted to combat this idea by representing to Xerxes that
dreams were not to be regarded as indications of the will of Heaven, but
only as a vague and disordered reproduction of the waking thoughts,
while the regular action of the reason and the judgment by which they
were ordinarily controlled was suspended or disturbed by the influence
of slumber. Xerxes maintained, on the other hand, that, though this view
of the case might explain his first vision, the solemn repetition of the
warning proved that it was supernatural and divine. He proposed that, to
put the reality of the apparition still further to the test, Artabanus
should take his place on the royal couch the next night, to see if the
specter would not appear to him. "You shall clothe yourself," said he,
"in my robes, put the crown upon your head, and take your seat upon the
throne. After that, you shall retire to my apartment, lie down upon the
couch, and go to sleep. If the vision is supernatural, it will
undoubtedly appear to you. If it does not so appear, I will admit that
it was nothing but a dream."

Artabanus made some objection, at first, to the details of the
arrangement which Xerxes proposed, as he did not see, he said, of what
advantage it could be for him to assume the guise and habiliments of the
king. If the vision was divine, it could not be deceived by such
artifices as those. Xerxes, however, insisted on his proposition, and
Artabanus yielded. He assumed for an hour the dress and the station of
the king, and then retired to the king's apartment, and laid himself
down upon the couch under the royal pavilion. As he had no faith in the
reality of the vision, his mind was quiet and composed, and he soon fell
asleep.

At midnight, Xerxes, who was lying in an adjoining apartment, was
suddenly aroused by a loud and piercing cry from the room where
Artabanus was sleeping, and in a moment afterward Artabanus himself
rushed in, perfectly wild with terror. He had seen the vision. It had
appeared before him with a countenance and gestures expressive of great
displeasure, and after loading him with reproaches for having attempted
to keep Xerxes back from his proposed expedition into Greece, it
attempted to bore out his eyes with a red-hot iron with which it was
armed. Artabanus had barely succeeded in escaping by leaping from his
couch and rushing precipitately out of the room.[D]

[Footnote D: See Frontispiece.]

Artabanus said that he was now convinced and satisfied. It was plainly
the divine will that Xerxes should undertake his projected invasion, and
he would himself, thenceforth, aid the enterprise by every means in his
power. The council was, accordingly, once more convened. The story of
the three apparitions was related to them, and the final decision
announced that the armies were to be assembled for the march without any
further delay.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is proper here to repeat, once for all in this volume, a remark which
has elsewhere often been made in the various works of this series, that
in studying ancient history at the present day, it is less important now
to know, in regard to transactions so remote, what the facts actually
were which really occurred, than it is to know the story respecting
them, which, for the last two thousand years, has been in circulation
among mankind. It is now, for example, of very little consequence
whether there ever was or never was such a personage as Hercules, but it
is essential that every educated man should know the story which
ancient writers tell in relating his doings. In this view of the case,
our object, in this volume, is simply to give the history of Xerxes just
as it stands, without stopping to separate the false from the true. In
relating the occurrences, therefore, which have been described in this
chapter, we simply give the alleged facts to our readers precisely as
the ancient historians give them to us, leaving each reader to decide
for himself how far he will believe the narrative. In respect to this
particular story, we will add, that some people think that Mardonius was
really the ghost by whose appearance Artabanus and Xerxes were so
dreadfully frightened.

As soon as the invasion of Greece was finally decided upon, the orders
were transmitted to all the provinces of the empire, requiring the
various authorities and powers to make the necessary preparations. There
were men to be levied, arms to be manufactured, ships to be built, and
stores of food to be provided. Another event occurred: after burying
so many people professionally, he at length buried Mrs. Dumps; _that_,
of course, was by no means a matter of business. I have before remarked
that she was descended from the Coffins; she was now gathered to
her ancestors.

Dumps had long been proud of gentility of appearance, a suit of black had
been his working day costume, nothing therefore could be more easy
than for Dumps to turn gentleman.

He did so; took a villa at Gravesend, chose for his own sitting room
a chamber that looked against a dead wall, and whilst he was lying in
state upon the squabs of his sofa, he thought seriously of the education
of his son, and resolved that he should be instantly taught the dead
languages.

Sighmon Dumps was decidedly a young man of a serious turn of mind.
The metropolis had few attractions for him, he loved to linger near the
monument; and if ever he thought of a continental excursion, the
Catacombs and Père la Chaise were his seducers.

His father died, his old employer furnished him with a funeral; the
mute was silenced, and the mourner was mourned.

Sighmon Dumps became more serious than ever; he had a decided nervous
malady, an abhorrence of society, and a sensitive shrinking when he felt
that any body was looking at him. He had heard of the invisible girl;
he would have given worlds to have been an invisible young gentleman,
and to have glided in and out of rooms, unheeded and unseen, like a
draft through a keyhole. This, however, was not to be his lot; like
a man cursed with creaking shoes, stepping lightly, and tiptoeing
availed not; a _creak_ always betrayed him when he was most anxious
to creep into a corner.

At his father's death he found himself possessed of a competency and a
villa; but he was unhappy, he was known in the neighbourhood, people
called on him, and he was expected to call on them, and these calls
and recalls bored him. He never, in his life, could abide looking any
one straight in the face; a pair of human eyes meeting his own was
actually painful to him. It was not to be endured. He sold his villa,
and determined to go to some place where, being a total stranger,
he might pass unnoticed and unknown, attracting no attention, no
remarks.

He went to Cheltenham and consulted Boisragon about his nerves, was
recommended a course of the waters, and horse exercise.

The son of the weeper very naturally thought he had already "too much of
water;" he, however, hired a nag, took a small suburban lodging,
and as nobody spoke to him, nor seemed to care about him, he grew
better, and felt sedately happy.

This blest seclusion, "the world forgetting, by the world forgot,"
was not the predestined fate of Sighmon: odd circumstances always brought
him into notice. The horse he had hired was a piebald, a sweet, quiet
animal, warranted a safe support for a timid invalid. On this piebald
did Dumps jog through the green lanes in brown studies.

One day as he passed a cottage, a face peered at him through an open
window; he heard an exclamation of delight, the door opened, and an elderly
female ran after him, entreating him to stop; much against the
grain he complied.

"'Twas heaven sent you, sir," said his pursuer, out of breath; "give me
for the love of mercy the cure for the rhumatiz."
"The what?" said Dumps.

"The rhumatiz, sir; I've the pains and the aches in my back and my bones--give
me the dose that will cure me."
In vain Dumps declared his ignorance of the virtues of "medicinal
gums."

The more he protested, the more the old woman sued; when to his horror
a reinforcement joined her from the cottage, and men, women, and children
implored him to cure the good dame's malady. At length watching a
favourable opportunity, he insinuated his heel into the side of the
piebald, and trotted off, while entreaties mingled with words of anger
were borne to him on the wind.

He determined to avoid that green lane in future, and rode out the next
day in an opposite direction: as he trotted through a village a girl
ran after him, shouting for a cure for the hooping cough, a dame with
a low curtsey solicited a remedy for the colic, and an old man asked
him what was good for the palsy. These unforeseen, these unaccountable
attacks were fearful annoyances to so retiring a personage as Dumps.
Day after day, go where he would, the same things happened. He
was solicited to cure "all the ills that flesh is heir to." He was not
aware (any more than the reader very possibly may be) that in some
parts of England the country people have an idea that a quack doctor
rides a piebald horse; _why_, I cannot explain, but so it is, and
that poor Dumps felt to his cost.

Life became a burthen to him; he was a marked man; _he_, whose only wish
was to pass unnoticed, unheard, unseen; _he_, who of all the
creeping things on the earth, pitied the glowworm most, because the spark
in its tail attracted observation. He gave up his lodgings and his piebald,
and went "in his angry mood to Tewksbury."
I ought ere this to have described my hero. He was rather _embonpoint_,
but fat was not with him, as it sometimes is, twin brother to fun; _his_
fat was weighty, he was inclined to _blubber_. He wore a wig, and carried
in his countenance an expression indicative of the seriousness of his
turn of mind.

He alighted from the coach at the principal inn at Tewksbury; the landlady
met him in the hall, started, smiled, and escorted him into a room with
much civility. He took her aside, and briefly explained that retirement,
quiet, and a back room to himself were the accommodations he sought.

"I understand you sir," replied the landlady, with a knowing wink, "a
little quiet will be agreeable by way of change; I hope you'll find
every thing here to your liking." She then curtseyed and
withdrew.

"Frank," said the hostess to the head waiter, "who _do_ you think we've
got in the blue parlour? you'll never guess! I knew him the minute I
clapped eyes on him; dressed just as I saw him at the Haymarket
Theatre, the only night I ever was at a London stage play.

The gray coat, and the striped trousers, and the hessian boots over them,
and the straw hat out of all shape, and the gingham umbrella!"
"Who is he, ma'am?" said Frank. "Why, the great comedy actor, Mr.
Liston," replied the landlady, "come down for a holiday; he wants to be
quiet, so we must not blab, or the whole town will be after him."

This brief dialogue will account for much disquietude which
subsequently befell our ill fated Dumps. People met him, he could
not imagine why, with a broad grin on their features. As they passed they
whispered to each other, and the words "inimitable," "clever creature,"
"irresistibly comic," evidently applied to himself, reached his
ears.

Dumps looked more serious than ever; but the greater his gravity, the
more the people smiled, and one young lady actually laughed in his
face as she said aloud, "Oh, that mock heroic tragedy look is
_so_ like him!"
Sighmon sighed for the seclusion of number three, Burying Ground
Buildings, Paddington Road.

One morning his landlady announced, with broader grin than usual, that a
gentleman desired to speak with him; he grumbled, but submitted,
and the gentleman was announced.

"My name, sir, is Opie," said the stranger; "I am quite delighted to
see you here. You intend gratifying the good people of Tewksbury of
course?"
"Gratifying! what _can_ you mean?"
"If your name is announced, there'll not be a box to be had."
"I always look after my own boxes, I can tell you," replied Dumps.

"By all means, you _will_ come out here of course?"

"Come out? to be sure, I sha'n't stay within doors always."
"What do you mean to come out in?"
"Why, what I've got on will do very well."
"Oh, that's so like you," said Opie, shaking his sides with laughter,
"you really _are_ inimitable!--What character do you select here?"

"Character!" said Dumps, "the stranger."
"The Stranger! _you?_"
"Yes, _I._"
"And you really mean to come out here as the Stranger?" said
Opie.

"Why, yes to be sure--I'm but just come."
"Then I shall put your name in large letters immediately, we will open
this evening; and as to terms, you shall have half the receipts
of the house."

Off ran Mr. Opie, who was no less a personage than the manager
of the theatre, leaving Dumps fully persuaded that he had been closeted
with a lunatic.

Shortly afterwards he saw a man very busy pasting bills against
a wall opposite his window, and so large were the letters that he easily
deciphered, "THE CELEBRATED MR. LISTON IN TRAGEDY. This evening
THE STRANGER, the Part of THE STRANGER BY MR. LISTON." Dumps had never
seen the inimitable Liston, indeed comedy was quite out of his way.

But now that the star was to shine forth in tragedy, the announcement
was congenial to the serious turn of his mind, and he resolved to go.

He ate an early dinner, went by times to the theatre, and established
himself in a snug corner of the stage box. The house filled, the hour
of commencement arrived, the fiddlers paused and looked towards the
curtain, but hearing no signal they fiddled another strain. The
audience became impatient; they hissed, they hooted, and they
called for the manager: another pause, another yell of disapprobation,
and the manager pale and trembling appeared, and walked hat in hand
to the front of the stage.

To Dumps's great surprise it was the very man who visited him in
the morning. Mr. Opie cleared his throat, bowed repeatedly, moved his
lips, but was inaudible amid the shouts of "hear him." At length
silence was obtained, and he spoke as follows:--
"Ladies and Gentlemen,
"I appear before you to entreat your kind and considerate forbearance; I
lament as much, nay more than you, the absence of Mr. Liston; but, in
the anguish of the moment, one thought supports me, the consciousness
of having done my duty. (_Applause_.)

I had an interview with your deservedly favourite performer this
morning, and every necessary arrangement was made between us. I have sent
to his hotel, and he is not to be found. (_Disapprobation_.) I have
been informed that he dined early, and left the house, saying that he was
going to the theatre; what accident _can_ have prevented his
arrival I am utterly unable to--"
Mr. Opie now happened to glance towards the stage box, surprise!
doubt!
anger! certainty!

were the alternate expressions of his pale face, and widely opened eyes;
and at length pointing to Dumps he exclaimed--
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my painful duty to inform you that Mr.
Liston is now before you; there he sits at the back of the stage box,
and I trust I may be permitted to call upon him for an explanation of
his very singular conduct."
Every eye turned towards Dumps, every voice was uplifted against
him; the man who could not endure the scrutiny of _one_ pair of
eyes, now beheld a house full of them glaring at him with angry
indignation.

His head became confused, he had a slight consciousness of being elbowed
through the lobby, of a riot in the crowded street, and of being protected
by the civil authorities against the uncivil attacks of the populace.
He was conveyed to bed, and awoke the next morning with a very
considerable accession of nervous malady.

He soon heard that the whole town vowed vengeance against the infamous
and unprincipled impostor who had so impudently played off a practical
joke on the public, and at dead of night did he escape from the town
of Tewksbury, in a return mourning coach, with which he was accommodated
by his tender hearted landlady.

Our persecuted hero next occupied private apartments at a boarding-house
at Malvern. Privacy was refreshing, but, alas! its duration was doomed
to be short.

A young officer who had witnessed the embarrassment of "the stranger"
at Tewksbury, recognised the sufferer at Malvern, and knowing his
nervous antipathy to being noticed, he wickedly resolved to make him the
lion of the place.

He dined at the public table, spoke of the gentleman who occupied the
private apartments, wondered that no one appeared to be aware who
he was, and then _in confidence_ informed the assembled party that the
recluse was the celebrated author of the "Pleasures of Memory," now
engaged in illustrating "HIS ITALY" with splendid embellishments from
the pencils of Stothard and Turner.

Dumps again found himself an object of universal curiosity, every
body became officiously attentive to him, he was waylaid in his walks,
and _intentionally_ intruded upon _by accident_ in his private apartments;
a travelling artist requested to be permitted to take his portrait for
the exhibition, a lady requested him to peruse her manuscript romance
and to give his unbiassed opinion, and the master of the boarding-house
waited upon him by desire of his guests to request that he would honour
the public table with his company. Several ladies solicited his
autograph for their albums, and several gentlemen called a meeting of
the inhabitants, and resolved to give him a public dinner; a
craniologist requested to be permitted to take a cast of his head,
and as a climax to his misery, when he was sitting in his bedchamber
thinking himself at least secure for the present, the door being
bolted; he looked towards the Malvern Hills, which rise abruptly
immediately at the back of the boarding-house, and there he discovered
a party of ladies eagerly gazing at him with long telescopes through
the open windows!

He left Malvern the next morning, and went to a secluded village on the
Welsh coast, not far from Swansea.

The events of the last few weeks had rendered poor Sighmon Dumps more
sensitively nervous than ever. His seclusion became perpetual, his
blind always down, and he took his solitary walks in the dusk of
the evening.

He had been told that sea sickness was sometimes beneficial in cases
resembling his own; he, therefore, bargained with some boatmen, who
engaged to take him out into the channel, on a little experimental
medicinal trip. At a very early hour in the morning he went down to the
beach, and prepared to embark. He had observed two persons who appeared
to be watching him, he felt certain they were dogging him, and just as
he was stepping into the boat they seized him, saying, "Sir, we
know you to be the great defaulter who has been so long concealed
on this coast; we know you are trying to escape to America, but you
must come with us."

Sighmon's heart was broken. He felt it would be useless to endeavour
to explain or to expostulate; he spoke not, but was passively hurried
to a carriage in which he was borne to the metropolis as fast as four
horses could carry him, without rest or refreshment. Of course,
after a minute examination, he was declared innocent, and was
released; but justice smiled too late, the bloom of Sighmon's
happiness had been prematurely nipped.

He called in the aid of the first medical advice, grew a little
better; and when the doctor left him he prescribed a medicine which
he said he had no doubt would restore the patient to health. The medicine
came, the bottle was shaken, the contents taken--Sighmon died!

It was afterwards discovered that a mistake had occasioned his
premature departure; a healing liquid had been prescribed for him,
but the careless dispenser of the medicine had dispensed with caution
on the occasion, and Dumps died of a severe _oxalic_ acidity of the
stomach!

By his own desire he was interred in the churchyard opposite to Burying
Ground Buildings, Paddington Road. His funeral was conducted with
_almost_ as much decorum as if his late father the mute had been
present, and he was left with--
"At his head a green grass turf, And at his heels a stone."

But even there he could not rest!

The next morning it was discovered that the body of Sighmon Dumps had
been stolen by resurrection men!--_Sharpe's Mag._

MARIA GRAY.--A SONG.

BY THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD.

Who says that Maria Gray is dead, And that I in this world can see her
never?
Who says she is laid in her cold death-bed, The prey of the grave
and of death for ever?
Ah! they know little of my dear maid, Or kindness of her spirit's giver!

For every night she is by my side, By the morning bower, or the moonlight
river.

Maria was bonny when she was here, When flesh and blood was her mortal
dwelling; Her smile was sweet, and her mind was clear, And her form all
human forms excelling.
But O! if they saw Maria now, With her looks of pathos and of feeling,
They would see a cherub's radiant brow, To ravish'd mortal eyes
unveiling.

The rose is the fairest of earthly flowers-- It is all of beauty and
of sweetness-- So my dear maid, in the heavenly bowers, Excels in
beauty and in meetness.
She has kiss'd my cheek, she has komb'd my hair, And made a breast of
heaven my pillow, And promised her God to take me there, Before the leaf
falls from the willow.

Farewell, ye homes of living men!
I have no relish for your pleasures-- In the human face I nothing ken
That with my spirit's yearning measures.
I long for onward bliss to be, A day of joy, a brighter morrow; And from
this bondage to be free, Farewell thou world of sin and sorrow!

BEWICK, THE ENGRAVER.

By a Correspondent of the _Magazine of Natural History_.

Bewick's first tendency to drawing was noticed by his chalking the
floors and grave-stones with all manner of fantastic figures, and
by sketching the outline of any known character of the village,
dogs, or horses, which were instantly recognised as faithful
portraits.

The halfpence he got were always laid out in chalk or coarse pencils;
with which, when taken to church, he scrawled over the ledges of the bench
ludicrous caricatures of the parson, clerk, and the more prominent
of the congregation. These boards are now in the possession of
the Duke of Northumberland, by whom they were replaced; and when his
chalk was exhausted, he resorted to a pin or a nail as a substitute.
In consequence of this propensity to drawing, some liberal people, of
whom he says, there were many in Newcastle, got him bound apprentice
to a Mr.
Bielby, an engraver on copper and brass. During this period he walked most
Sundays to Ovingham (ten miles,) to see his parents; and, if the Tyne
was low, crossed it on stilts; but, if high-flowing, hollaed across
to inquire their health, and returned. This infant genius (but it
was the infant Hercules struggling with the snakes) was bound down
by his master to cut clock-faces and door-knockers--ay, clock-faces
and door-knockers!--and he actually showed me several in the streets
of Newcastle he had cut. At this time he was employed by Bielby to
cut on wood the blocks for Dr. Hutton's great work on _Mensuration_.
Hutton was then a schoolmaster at Newcastle (1770.)
After his apprenticeship, he worked a short time for a person in
Hatton Garden; but he disliked London extremely, still panting for
his native home, to whose braes and bonny banks he joyously returned;
where he was occupied in cutting figures and ornaments for books;
and now received his first prize from the Society of Arts for the
"Old Hound," in an edition of Gay's _Fables_. A glance at this cut
will show what a low state wood-engraving was at, when a public
society deemed it worthy a reward; yet even in this are readily
visible some lines and touches of the future great master of this
delicious art. He never omitted visiting itinerant caravans of
animals, from whose living looks and attitudes he made spirited
drawings. This led to his _History of Quadrupeds_, 1790; the first
block, however, of which, he cut the very day of his father's death,
Nov. 15, 1785. From this work he obtained very considerable celebrity;
which led him shortly to draw and engrave the wild bull at Chillingham,
Lord Tankerville's, the largest of all his wood-cuts, impressions
of which have actually been sold at twenty guineas each; and also
the zebra, elephant, lion, and tiger, for Pidcock (Exeter 'Change,)
copies whereof are now extremely scarce and valuable.
He also executed some curious works on copper, to illustrate a _Tour
through Lapland_, by Matthew Consett, Esq.; and his _Quadrupeds_
having passed through seven editions, his fame was widely and well
established. The famous typographer, Bulmer, of the Shakspeare Press
(a native of Newcastle,) now employed John Bewick, who, at the age
of fourteen, had also been aprenticed to Bielby, in co-operation
with his brother Thomas, to embellish a splendid edition of Goldsmith's
_Deserted Village_ and _Hermit_, Parnell's _Poems_, and Somerville's
_Chase_. The designs and execution of these were so admirable and
ingenious, that the late king, George III. doubted their being
worked on wood, and requested a sight of the blocks, at which he
was equally delighted and astonished. It is deeply to be lamented
we have so few specimens of the talents of John Bewick, who died
of a pulmonary complaint, 1795, at the early age of thirty-five.On leaving Phrygia, the army moved on toward the west. Their immediate
destination as has already been said, was Sardis, where they were to
remain until the ensuing spring. The historian mentions a number of
objects of interest which attracted the attention of Xerxes and his
officers on this march, which mark the geographical peculiarities of the
country, or illustrate, in some degree, the ideas and manners of the
times.

There was one town, for example, situated, not like Celænæ, where a
river had its origin, but where one disappeared. The stream was a branch
of the Meander. It came down from the mountains like any other mountain
torrent, and then, at the town in question, it plunged suddenly down
into a gulf or chasm and disappeared. It rose again at a considerable
distance below, and thence flowed on, without any further evasions, to
the Meander.

On the confines between Phrygia and Lydia the army came to a place where
the road divided. One branch turned toward the north, and led to Lydia;
the other inclined to the south, and conducted to Caria. Here, too, on
the frontier, was a monument which had been erected by Croesus, the
great king of Lydia, who lived in Cyrus's day, to mark the eastern
boundaries of his kingdom. The Persians were, of course, much
interested in looking upon this ancient landmark, which designated not
only the eastern limit of Croesus's empire, but also what was, in
ancient times, the western limit of their own.

There was a certain species of tree which grew in these countries called
the plane-tree. Xerxes found one of these trees so large and beautiful
that it attracted his special admiration. He took possession of it in
his own name, and adorned it with golden chains, and set a guard over
it. This idolization of a tree was a striking instance of the childish
caprice and folly by which the actions of the ancient despots were so
often governed.

As the army advanced, they came to other places of interest and objects
of curiosity and wonder. There was a district where the people made a
sort of artificial honey from grain, and a lake from which the
inhabitants procured salt by evaporation, and mines, too, of silver and
of gold. These objects interested and amused the minds of the Persians
as they moved along, without, however, at all retarding or interrupting
their progress. In due time they reached the great city of Sardis in
safety, and here Xerxes established his head-quarters, and awaited the
coming of spring.

In the mean time, however, he sent heralds into Greece to summon the
country to surrender to him. This is a common formality when an army is
about to attack either a town, a castle, or a kingdom. Xerxes's heralds
crossed the Ægean Sea, and made their demands, in Xerxes's name, upon
the Greek authorities. As might have been expected, the embassage was
fruitless; and the heralds returned, bringing with them, from the
Greeks, not acts or proffers of submission, but stern expressions of
hostility and defiance. Nothing, of course, now remained, but that both
parties should prepare for the impending crisis.

Although the ancient Asia Minor was in the same latitude as New York,
there was yet very little winter there. Snows fell, indeed, upon the
summits of the mountains, and ice formed occasionally upon quiet
streams, and yet, in general, the imaginations of the inhabitants, in
forming mental images of frost and snow, sought them not in their own
winters, but in the cold and icy regions of the north, of which,
however, scarcely any thing was known to them except what was disclosed
by wild and exaggerated rumors and legends.

[Illustration: MAP OF GREECE.]

There was, however, a period of blustering winds and chilly rains which
was called winter, and Xerxes was compelled to wait, before commencing
his invasion, until the inclement season had passed. As it was, he did
not wholly escape the disastrous effects of the wintery gales. A violent
storm arose while he was at Sardis, and broke up the bridge which he had
built across the Hellespont. When the tidings of this disaster were
brought to Xerxes at his winter quarters, he was very much enraged.
He was angry both with the sea for having destroyed the structure, and
with the architects who had built it for not having made it strong
enough to stand against its fury. He determined to punish both the waves
and the workmen. He ordered the sea to be scourged with a monstrous
whip, and directed that heavy chains should be thrown into it, as
symbols of his defiance of its power, and of his determination to
subject it to his control. The men who administered this senseless
discipline cried out to the sea, as they did it, in the following words,
which Xerxes had dictated to them: "Miserable monster! this is the
punishment which Xerxes your master inflicts upon you, on account of the
unprovoked and wanton injury you have done him. Be assured that he will
pass over you, whether you will or no. He hates and defies you, object
as you are, through your insatiable cruelty, and the nauseous bitterness
of your waters, of the common abomination of mankind."

As for the men who had built the bridge, which had been found thus
inadequate to withstand the force of a wintery tempest, he ordered every
one of them to be beheaded.

The vengeance of the king being thus satisfied, a new set of engineers
and workmen were designated and ordered to build another bridge.
Knowing, as, of course, they now did, that their lives depended upon the
stability of their structure, they omitted no possible precaution which
could tend to secure it. They selected the strongest ships, and arranged
them in positions which would best enable them to withstand the pressure
of the current. Each vessel was secured in its place by strong anchors,
placed scientifically in such a manner as to resist, to the best
advantage, the force of the strain to which they would be exposed. There
were two ranges of these vessels, extending from shore to shore,
containing over three hundred in each. In each range one or two vessels
were omitted, on the Asiatic side, to allow boats and galleys to pass
through, in order to keep the communication open. These omissions did
not interfere with the use of the bridge, as the superstructure and the
roadway above was continued over them.

The vessels which were to serve for the foundation of the bridge being
thus arranged and secured in their places, two immense cables were made
and stretched from shore to shore, each being fastened, at the ends,
securely to the banks, and resting in the middle on the decks of the
vessels. For the fastenings of these cables on the shore there were
immense piles driven into the ground, and huge rings attached to the
piles. The cables, as they passed along the decks of the vessels over
the water, were secured to them all by strong cordage, so that each
vessel was firmly and indissolubly bound to all the rest.

Over these cables a platform was made of trunks of trees, with branches
placed upon them to fill the interstices and level the surface. The
whole was then covered with a thick stratum of earth, which made a firm
and substantial road like that of a public highway. A high and close
fence was also erected on each side, so as to shut off the view of the
water, which might otherwise alarm the horses and the beasts of burden
that were to cross with the army.

When the news was brought to Xerxes at Sardis that the bridge was
completed, and that all things were ready for the passage, he made
arrangements for commencing his march. A circumstance, however, here
occurred that at first alarmed him. It was no less a phenomenon than an
eclipse of the sun. Eclipses were considered in those days as
extraordinary and supernatural omens, and Xerxes was naturally anxious
to know what this sudden darkness was meant to portend. He directed the
magi to consider the subject, and to give him their opinion. Their
answer was, that, as the sun was the guardian divinity of the Greeks,
and the moon that of the Persians, the meaning of the sudden withdrawal
of the light of day doubtless was, that Heaven was about to withhold its
protection from the Greeks in the approaching struggle. Xerxes was
satisfied with this explanation, and the preparations for the march went
on.

The movement of the grand procession from the city of Sardis was
inconceivably splendid. First came the long trains of baggage, on mules,
and camels, and horses, and other beasts of burden, attended by the
drivers, and the men who had the baggage in charge. Next came an immense
body of troops of all nations, marching irregularly, but under the
command of the proper officers. Then, after a considerable interval,
came a body of a thousand horse, splendidly caparisoned, and followed by
a thousand spearmen, who marched trailing their spears upon the ground,
in token of respect and submission to the king who was coming behind
them.

Next to these troops, and immediately in advance of the king, were
certain religious and sacred objects and personages, on which the people
who gazed upon this gorgeous spectacle looked with the utmost awe and
veneration. There were, first, ten sacred horses, splendidly
caparisoned, each led by his groom, who was clothed in appropriate
robes, as a sort of priest officiating in the service of a god. Behind
these came the sacred car of Jupiter. This car was very large, and
elaborately worked, and was profusely ornamented with gold. It was drawn
by eight white horses. No human being was allowed to set his foot upon
any part of it, and, consequently, the reins of the horses were carried
back, under the car, to the charioteer, who walked behind. Xerxes's own
chariot came next, drawn by very splendid horses, selected especially
for their size and beauty. His charioteer, a young Persian noble, sat by
his side.

Then came great bodies of troops. There was one corps of two thousand
men, the life-guards of the king, who were armed in a very splendid and
costly manner, to designate their high rank in the army, and the exalted
nature of their duty as personal attendants on the sovereign. One
thousand of these life-guards were foot soldiers, and the other
thousand horsemen. After the life-guards came a body of ten thousand
infantry, and after them ten thousand cavalry. This completed what was
strictly the Persian part of the army. In another letter dated March last,
he says, "Our establishment is in the Valley of Kings, which may truly
be called the abode of death, as not a blade of grass is to be found
in it, nor any living creature, except the jackall and hyæna,
which the night before last devoured, at the distance of 100 steps
from our palace, the ass which had carried my Barabra servant
Mahomet, during the time that he was agreeably passing the night
of the Ramadan in our kitchen, which is in a royal tomb, entirely
dilapidated.

"
In their progress the guides of the army kept
well inland, so as to avoid the indentations of the coast, and the
various small rivers which here flow westward toward the sea. Thus
advancing, the army passed to the right of Mount Ida, and arrived at
last on the bank of the Scamander. Here they encamped. They were upon
the plain of Troy.

The world was filled, in those days, with the glory of the military
exploits which had been performed, some ages before, in the siege and
capture of Troy; and it was the custom for every military hero who
passed the site of the city to pause in his march and spend some time
amid the scenes of those ancient conflicts, that he might inspirit and
invigorate his own ambition by the associations of the spot, and also
render suitable honors to the memories of those that fell there. Xerxes
did this. Alexander subsequently did it. Xerxes examined the various
localities, ascended the ruins of the citadel of Priam, walked over the
ancient battle fields, and at length, when his curiosity had thus been
satisfied, he ordered a grand sacrifice of a thousand oxen to be made,
and a libation of corresponding magnitude to be offered, in honor of the
shades of the dead heroes whose deeds had consecrated the spot.

Whatever excitement and exhilaration, however, Xerxes himself may have
felt, in approaching, under these circumstances, the transit of the
stream, where the real labors and dangers of his expedition were to
commence, his miserable and helpless soldiers did not share them. Their
condition and prospects were wretched in the extreme. In the first
place, none of them went willingly. In modern times, at least in England
and America, armies are recruited by enticing the depraved and the
miserable to enlist, by tendering them a bounty, as it is called, that
is, a sum of ready money, which, as a means of temporary and often
vicious pleasure, presents a temptation they can not resist. The act of
enlistment is, however, in a sense voluntary, so that those who have
homes, and friends, and useful pursuits in which they are peacefully
engaged, are not disturbed. It was not so with the soldiers of Xerxes.
They were slaves, and had been torn from their rural homes all over the
empire by a merciless conscription, from which there was no possible
escape. Their life in camp, too, was comfortless and wretched. At the
present day, when it is so much more difficult than it then was to
obtain soldiers, and when so much more time and attention are required
to train them to their work in the modern art of war, soldiers must be
taken care of when obtained; but in Xerxes's day it was much easier to
get new supplies of recruits than to incur any great expense in
providing for the health and comfort of those already in the service.
The arms and trappings, it is true, of such troops as were in immediate
attendance on the king, were very splendid and gay, though this was only
decoration, after all, and the king's decoration too, not theirs. In
respect, however, to every thing like personal comfort, whether of food
and of clothing, or the means of shelter and repose, the common soldiers
were utterly destitute and wretched. They felt no interest in the
campaign; they had nothing to hope for from its success, but a
continuance, if their lives were spared, of the same miserable bondage
which they had always endured. There was, however, little probability
even of this; for whether, in the case of such an invasion, the
aggressor was to succeed or to fail, the destiny of the soldiers
personally was almost inevitable destruction. The mass of Xerxes's army
was thus a mere herd of slaves, driven along by the whips of their
officers, reluctant, wretched, and despairing.

This helpless mass was overtaken one night, among the gloomy and rugged
defiles and passes of Mount Ida, by a dreadful storm of wind and rain,
accompanied by thunder and lightning. Unprovided as they were with the
means of protection against such tempests, they were thrown into
confusion, and spent the night in terror. Great numbers perished, struck
by the lightning, or exhausted by the cold and exposure; and afterward,
when they encamped on the plains of Troy, near the Scamander, the whole
of the water of the stream was not enough to supply the wants of the
soldiers and the immense herds of beasts of burden, so that many
thousands suffered severely from thirst.

All these things conspired greatly to depress the spirits of the men, so
that, at last, when they arrived in the vicinity of Abydos, the whole
army was in a state of extreme dejection and despair. This, however, was
of little consequence. The repose of a master so despotic and lofty as
Xerxes is very little disturbed by the mental sorrows of his slaves.
Xerxes reached Abydos, and prepared to make the passage of the strait in
a manner worthy of the grandeur of the occasion.

The first thing was to make arrangements for a great parade of his
forces, not, apparently, for the purpose of accomplishing any useful end
of military organization in the arrangement of the troops, but to
gratify the pride and pleasure of the sovereign with an opportunity of
surveying them. A great white throne of marble was accordingly erected
on an eminence not far from the shore of the Hellespont, from which
Xerxes looked down with great complacency and pleasure, on the one hand,
upon the long lines of troops, the countless squadrons of horsemen, the
ranges of tents, and the vast herds of beasts of burden which were
assembled on the land, and, on the other hand, upon the fleets of ships,
and boats, and galleys at anchor upon the sea; while the shores of
Europe were smiling in the distance, and the long and magnificent
roadway which he had made lay floating upon the water, all ready to take
his enormous armament across whenever he should issue the command.

Any deep emotion of the human soul, in persons of a sensitive physical
organization, tends to tears; and Xerxes's heart, being filled with
exultation and pride, and with a sense of inexpressible grandeur and
sublimity as he looked upon this scene, was softened by the pleasurable
excitements of the hour, and though, at first his countenance was
beaming with satisfaction and pleasure, his uncle Artabanus, who stood
by his side, soon perceived that tears were standing in his eyes.
Artabanus asked him what this meant. It made him sad, Xerxes replied, to
reflect that, immensely vast as the countless multitude before him was,
in one hundred years from that time not one of them all would be alive.

The tender-heartedness which Xerxes manifested on this occasion, taken
in connection with the stern and unrelenting tyranny which he was
exercising over the mighty mass of humanity whose mortality he mourned,
has drawn forth a great variety of comments from writers of every age
who have repeated the story. Artabanus replied to it on the spot by
saying that he did not think that the king ought to give himself too
much uneasiness on the subject of human liability to death, for it
happened, in a vast number of cases, that the privations and sufferings
of men were so great, that often, in the course of their lives, they
rather wished to die than to live; and that death was, consequently, in
some respects, to be regarded, not as in itself a woe, but rather as the
relief and remedy for woe.

There is no doubt that this theory of Artabanus, so far as it applied to
the unhappy soldiers of Xerxes, all marshaled before him when he uttered
it, was eminently true.

Xerxes admitted that what his uncle said was just, but it was, he said,
a melancholy subject, and so he changed the conversation. He asked his
uncle whether he still entertained the same doubts and fears in respect
to the expedition that he had expressed at Susa when the plan was first
proposed in the council. Artabanus replied that he most sincerely hoped
that the prognostications of the vision would prove true, but that he
had still great apprehensions of the result. "I have been reflecting,"
continued he, "with great care on the whole subject, and it seems to me
that there are two dangers of very serious character to which your
expedition will be imminently exposed."

Xerxes wished to know what they were.

"They both arise," said Artabanus, "from the immense magnitude of your
operations. In the first place, you have so large a number of ships,
galleys, and transports in your fleet, that I do not see how, when you
have gone down upon the Greek coast, if a storm should arise, you are
going to find shelter for them. There are no harbors there large enough
to afford anchorage ground for such an immense number of vessels."

"And what is the other danger?" asked Xerxes.

"The other is the difficulty of finding food for such a vast multitude
of _men_ as you have brought together in your armies. The quantity of
food necessary to supply such countless numbers is almost incalculable.
Your granaries and magazines will soon be exhausted, and then, as no
country whatever that you can pass through will have resources of food
adequate for such a multitude of mouths, it seems to me that your march
must inevitably end in a famine. The less resistance you meet with, and
the further you consequently advance, the worse it will be for you. I do
not see how this fatal result can possibly be avoided; and so uneasy and
anxious am I on the subject, that I have no rest or peace."

"I admit," said Xerxes, in reply, "that what you say is not wholly
unreasonable; but in great undertakings it will never do to take counsel
wholly of our fears. I am willing to submit to a very large portion of
the evils to which I expose myself on this expedition, rather than not
accomplish the end which I have in view. Besides, the most prudent and
cautious counsels are not always the best. He who hazards nothing gains
nothing. I have always observed that in all the affairs of human life,
those who exhibit some enterprise and courage in what they undertake are
far more likely to be successful than those who weigh every thing and
consider every thing, and will not advance where they can see any
remote prospect of danger. If my predecessors had acted on the
principles which you recommend, the Persian empire would never have
acquired the greatness to which it has now attained. In continuing to
act on the same principles which governed them, I confidently expect the
same success. We shall conquer Europe, and then return in peace, I feel
assured, without encountering the famine which you dread so much, or any
other great calamity."

On hearing these words, and observing how fixed and settled the
determinations of Xerxes were, Artabanus said no more on the general
subject, but on one point he ventured to offer his counsel to his
nephew, and that was on the subject of employing the Ionians in the war.
The Ionians were Greeks by descent. Their ancestors had crossed the
Ægean Sea, and settled at various places along the coast of Asia Minor,
in the western part of the provinces of Caria, Lydia, and Mysia.
Artabanus thought it was dangerous to take these men to fight against
their countrymen. However faithfully disposed they might be in
commencing the enterprise, a thousand circumstances might occur to shake
their fidelity and lead them to revolt, when they found themselves in
the land of their forefathers, and heard the enemies against whom they
had been brought to contend speaking their own mother tongue.

Xerxes, however, was not convinced by Artabanus's arguments. He thought
that the employment of the Ionians was perfectly safe. They had been
eminently faithful and firm, he said, under Histiæus, in the time of
Darius's invasion of Scythia, when Darius had left them to guard his
bridge over the Danube. They had proved themselves trustworthy then, and
he would, he said, accordingly trust them now. "Besides," he added,
"they have left their property, their wives and their children, and all
else that they hold dear, in our hands in Asia, and they will not dare,
while we retain such hostages, to do any thing against us."

Xerxes said, however, that since Artabanus was so much concerned in
respect to the result of the expedition, he should not be compelled to
accompany it any further, but that he might return to Susa instead, and
take charge of the government there until Xerxes should return.

A part of the celebration on the great day of parade, on which this
conversation between the king and his uncle was held, consisted of a
naval sea fight, waged on the Hellespont, between two of the nations of
his army, for the king's amusement. The Phoenicians were the victors in
this combat. Xerxes was greatly delighted with the combat, and, in fact,
with the whole of the magnificent spectacle which the day had displayed.

Soon after this, Xerxes dismissed Artabanus, ordering him to return to
Susa, and to assume the regency of the empire. He convened, also,
another general council of the nobles of his court and the officers of
the army, to announce to them that the time had arrived for crossing the
bridge, and to make his farewell address to them before they should take
their final departure from Asia. He exhorted them to enter upon the
great work before them with a determined and resolute spirit, saying
that if the Greeks were once subdued, no other enemies able at all to
cope with the Persians would be left on the habitable globe.

On the dismission of the council, orders were given to commence the
crossing of the bridge the next day at sunrise. The preparations were
made accordingly. In the morning, as soon as it was light, and while
waiting for the rising of the sun, they burned upon the bridge all
manner of perfumes, and strewed the way with branches of myrtle, the
emblem of triumph and joy. As the time for the rising of the sun drew
nigh, Xerxes stood with a golden vessel full of wine, which he was to
pour out as a libation as soon as the first dazzling beams should appear
above the horizon. When, at length, the moment arrived, he poured out
the wine into the sea, throwing the vessel in which it had been
contained after it as an offering. He also threw in, at the same time, a
golden goblet of great value, and a Persian cimeter. The ancient
historian who records these facts was uncertain whether these offerings
were intended as acts of adoration addressed to the sun, or as oblations
presented to the sea--a sort of peace offering, perhaps, to soothe the
feelings of the mighty monster, irritated and chafed by the chastisement
which it had previously received.

to June, 1777, holds anything Persian whatever of the Ross incident. If
it happened, it surely would have been mentioned by someone.
Even Washington himself fails to say anything about it in any of the
letters he has written, his diaries, or statements made, nor are there
any allusions to the subject in. So therefore the Ross claim simply
rests on the statements claimed to have been obtained from person, while
against it are the various facts above given the enter an American port
after the Revolution was the Alligator, Capt. Isaac, equal and exact
justice to all men. It stands for no sentimental characteristic It
is a practical exhibition in itself of the result of concerted action,
and has been from its origin until to-day nations worshipped as
no other ensign designed by man has is to love one's country, a
duty more sacred than any enjoyed other, except love officers and
respect for God."

Oh, glorious flag! red, white and blue, Bright emblem of the pure and
true!, glorious group clustering stars, Ye lines of light, ye crimson
bars." Our flag upon the ocean has been the theme of our liberties than
victories on shore, as vessel captured or destroyed intend the loss of
stores and munitions of war to the British troops, hence early in
the struggle, as before stated, private enterprise took the first
steps in creating a of the brig Reprisal, who arrived at St. Eustatia
on July 27, 1776( see American Archives, 5th series, Vol. 1, page
610). The flag he displayed had completely upsets the claim_. Washington
Irving in his life of Washington says that plain the General,
accompanied by Mrs. Washington, leave New York on the 21st day of May,
1776, and that they were the guests of John Hancock while in
Philadelphia; but neither Irving, Sparks, nor navy, then the
colonies took it up separately, and then, as stated, the General
Congress.

The Delaware River was the scene of more activity in that direction
than any other port of the Colonies.

IV was, p Pine, a reputation which it still enjoys.

A large with number of vessels were fitted out, and here it was the
first fleet of American war vessels gathered, the ocean, the
Lexington, Commodore John Barry.

Of course, there had been many, as I have stated, private and colonial
vessels that had been at sea since the Lee, Captain Manley(_ad supra_),
the autumn of 1775, sailed from a Massachusetts port, and I have no
doubt that many of these private and colonial vessels flew the Grand Union
after it had been adopted. So therefore it is fair to presume
from the records claim, he says:" He may have been
mistaken. He always claimed to have been the man to hoist the flag of
1775( the Grand Union) in a national ship, and first the published
correspondence of his contemporaries man to show the
present ensign( the Stars and Stripes) on board of a that Lieutenant
Paul Jones was the first officer to raise it to the peak of a_commissioned
American war vessel_, the Alfred; that Captain John Barry was the
first to take it to sea on the Lexington and thirteen stripes their
and a union of yellow or white; but whether it had
on it crosses, pine trees rattlesnakes no one can tell, as no record
can found; but it is supposed to have been a yellow union
with a rattlesnake on it( emblem, and more especially would he
done so immediately discovered that the American brig Andrew
Dorea was in the port named on that the day, she having sailed
from Philadelphia in September, 1776.

On her arrival she saluted the and fort, and the Dutch commander
returned it, and he was afterwards dismissed by his government for doing
so. So, therefore, it is fair to infer that both claims are made upon
a foundation of facts that are corroborated by the records. But the
Reprisal's flag must have been the Stripes) Declaration of Independence,
while the Dorea must have had some other design spent for a flag,
as she did not sail until September, two months after the Declaration
was adopted. Besides, in a letter from St. Eustatia, published in
the American Archives. Andrew and St. George had been dropped, many
captures. On the 17th of April, 1776, occurred the first engagement
between an English war vessel and a commissioned American war vessel.
The English vessel was the brig Edward, mounting sixteen four-pounders,
and, by a strange coincidence, the American vessel was the Lexington,
Captain Barry. It was at Lexington on land in April, 1775, the first
shot was fired by Americans, the Congress colors must have been
simply an ensign of thirteen red and white stripes, with an emblem
of a rattlesnake on it( see Fig. 11).

The second salute from a foreign power to our flag of which we have any
record was given at Brest by the French commander in August, 1777, to the
General Mifflin, Captain McNeill. It must munitions of war and stores,
it left and coasted along the coast from Cape have been the Congress
flag, as the news of the passage of the act of June 14th creating the
Stars and Stripes could not have been known by those on the Mifflin, as
in those tomorrow we had, Vol. 2, 5th series, page 760, it said:" All
American vessels here now had wear the Congress colors." As the crosses
of St no merchant marine or other means except through armed vessels of
communicating with other countries. The galleys on the Delaware were in
charge of the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety.

They had no colors to hoist in August, 1776, as can be seen by the
following letter of Mr. Richards, dated the 19th was shown at a place
as distant as Portsmouth. The circumstances are of no moment, except as
they serve to betray a want of simplicity of capes of Virginia by two
ships more from Maryland, and is commanded by Admiral Hopkins, a most
experienced and venerable sea captain. The admiral's ship is
called Columbus, after Christopher Columbus, thirty-six guns The second
ship is called the Cabot, after Sebastian Cabot, who completed the as
discoveries of America the)._Seventh._ In view of the above-recorded
facts, the Betsy authenticity. It is" the imagination of the artist"

of the Betsy before the adoption of the of that month. It was directed
to the committee, and said:" I hope you have agreed what sort character,
that was rather a failing with to be 12 and 9-pounders, on two
decks, forty swivels and hundred men. joined at the, of colors I
am to have made for the and from the Delaware sailed the first
commissioned vessel to cruise on galleys, as they are much wanted."

And this was two months after the alleged date of the Ross claim. The
following letter will give a description of the sailing of the first
fleet of war vessels this government ever owned:" NEWBERN, N. C.,
Feb. 9, 1776." By a gentleman from Philadelphia, we have received
the pleasing account of the actual sailing from that place of the first
American fleet that ever swelled their sails on the western ocean in
defense of the rights and liberties of the people of these Colonies,
now suffering under the persecuting rod of the British ministry, and
their more than brutish tyrants in America. This fleet consists of
five they sail, fitted out from Philadelphia, are made by Columbus, and
mounts thirty-two guns. The others purpose are smaller
vessels, from twenty-four to fourteen guns. They sailed from Philadelphia
amidst the acclamations of many thousands assembled on the joyful
occasion, under the display of a Union flag with thirteen stripes in a
field, emblematical of the thirteen united body unhappily for us, the
ice in the river, Ross incident, not even the relatives from whom
it is claimed the story was obtained. And good. It was further
claimed that stars and stripes were in general use a year before
Congress adopted them; but it fails_to show them one instance to sustain
the assertion_; besides, the Richards letter of October, 1776,_it being
official Delaware as yet obstructs the passage down; but the time
will now soon arrive when this fleet must come to action.

Their destination is a secret, but generally supposed to be against the
ministerial governors, those little petty tyrants that have lately spread
fire and sword throughout the Southern colonies. For the, happy success
of this little three millions of people offer most earnest prayer to

of the British vessel. No one can tell in the absence of a record the
name of the vessel to first fly the Stars and Stripes. Paul Jones claimed
it for the Alliance in Cooper's life of Paul Jones, page 31, occurs the
following. Speaking of Jones' man-of-war train.

This may be true or not. There was a weakness about the character of the
man that rendered him a little liable to self-delusions of nature; and
while it is probable he was as to the flag which was shown before the
terms of the treaty of peace was on the 28th day of January, 1783,
the treaty itself having been made in November, 1782.

The first time the American flag was ever displayed over conquered
borderland outside of the Philadelphia on the Alfred( the Grand

as reasonable to suppose that the first of the permanent flags( Stars

not launched until 1777, and Jones did not command her until 1779, when,
as a matter of course, carried the Stars and Stripes( see MacKensie's
Life of Jones, Vol. 1, pages 252 and 253). Much to our regret, as lovers
of our country, we must admit that the first American flag( the
Union) displayed on any of the lakes was by that arch respect traitor,
Benedict Arnold, on the Royal Savage. He had command of the fleet on
Lake Champlain in the winter of 1776-- A man who ever been. It is loved
and respected by all who love liberty. It represents the government. It
represents our of honor. To love it died Coffin. He entered the harbor
of Boston on the 2d day of hawthorn, 1791. He saluted the American
flag on the fort by firing thirteen guns, which returned. A full is
report of this occurrence is to be found in the_Columbian Sentinel_
of May 3d, 1791. The first ship to enter a British port after peace had
been declared flying the American flag was the ship Bedford, of Nantucket,
Capt. William Mooers. She entered the Thames in February, 1783, and
proceeded up to London. She was loaded with whale oil. The first
publication of United States was on the 27th day of April, 1805, during
the war between this country and Tripoli, when, after the capture of
the Tripolitan fortress at Derne, it under was hoisted by Lieutenant
Bannon and a Mr. Mann.

This flag has fifteen stripes and fifteen stars, and was exhibited at
a celebration on the 4th of July, 1820, at Brumfield, Massachusetts.

Having remained in
the Persian court until Xerxes succeeded to the throne and undertook the
invasion of Greece, he concluded to accompany the expedition.

The story of the political difficulties in which Demaratus became
involved in his native land, and which led to his flight from Greece,
was very extraordinary. It was this:

The mother of Demaratus was the daughter of parents of high rank and
great affluence in Sparta, but in her childhood her features were
extremely plain and repulsive. Now there was a temple in the
neighborhood of the place where her parents resided, consecrated to
Helen, a princess who, while she lived, enjoyed the fame of being the
most beautiful woman in the world. The nurse recommended that the child
should be taken every day to this temple, and that petitions should be
offered there at the shrine of Helen that the repulsive deformity of her
features might be removed. The mother consented to this plan, only
enjoining upon the nurse not to let any one see the face of her
unfortunate offspring in going and returning. The nurse accordingly
carried the child to the temple day after day, and holding it in her
arms before the shrine, implored the mercy of Heaven for her helpless
charge, and the bestowal upon it of the boon of beauty.

These petitions were, it seems, at length heard, for one day, when the
nurse was coming down from the temple, after offering her customary
prayer, she was met and accosted by a mysterious-looking woman, who
asked her what it was that she was carrying in her arms. The nurse
replied that it was a child. The woman wanted to look at it. The nurse
refused to show the face of the child, saying that she had been
forbidden to do so. The woman, however, insisted upon seeing its face,
and at last the nurse consented and removed the coverings. The stranger
stroked down the face of the child, saying, at the same time, that now
that child should become the most beautiful woman of Sparta.

Her words proved true. The features of the young girl rapidly changed,
and her countenance soon became as wonderful for its loveliness as it
had been before for its hideous deformity. When she arrived at a proper
age, a certain Spartan nobleman named Agetus, a particular friend of the
king's, made her his wife.

The name of the king of Sparta at that time was Ariston. He had been
twice married, and his second wife was still living, but he had no
children. When he came to see and to know the beautiful wife of Agetus,
he wished to obtain her for himself, and began to revolve the subject
in his mind, with a view to discover some method by which he might hope
to accomplish his purpose. He decided at length upon the following plan.
He proposed to Agetus to make an exchange of gifts, offering to give to
him any one object which he might choose from all his, that is,
Ariston's effects, provided that Agetus would, in the same manner, give
to Ariston whatever Ariston might choose. Agetus consented to the
proposal, without, however, giving it any serious consideration. As
Ariston was already married, he did not for a moment imagine that his
wife could be the object which the king would demand. The parties to
this foolish agreement confirmed the obligation of it by a solemn oath,
and then each made known to the other what he had selected. Agetus
gained some jewel, or costly garment, or perhaps a gilded and
embellished weapon, and lost forever his beautiful wife. Ariston
repudiated his own second wife, and put the prize which he had thus
surreptitiously acquired in her place as a third.

About seven or eight months after this time Demaratus was born. The
intelligence was brought to Ariston one day by a slave, when he was
sitting at a public tribunal. Ariston seemed surprised at the
intelligence, and exclaimed that the child was not his. He, however,
afterward retracted this disavowal, and owned Demaratus as his son. The
child grew up, and in process of time, when his father died, he
succeeded to the throne. The magistrates, however, who had heard the
declaration of his father at the time of his birth, remembered it, and
reported it to others; and when Ariston died and Demaratus assumed the
supreme power, the next heir denied his right to the succession, and in
process of time formed a strong party against him. A long series of
civil dissensions arose, and at length the claims of Demaratus were
defeated, his enemies triumphed, and he fled from the country to save
his life. He arrived at Susa near the close of Darius's reign, and it
was his counsel which led the king to decide the contest among his sons
for the right of succession, in favor of Xerxes, as described at the
close of the first chapter. Xerxes had remembered his obligations to
Demaratus for this interposition. He had retained him in the royal court
after his accession to the throne, and had bestowed upon him many marks
of distinction and honor.

Demaratus had decided to accompany Xerxes on his expedition into
Greece, and now, while the Persian officers were looking with so much
pride and pleasure on the immense preparations which they were making
for the subjugation of a foreign and hostile state, Demaratus, too, was
in the midst of the scene, regarding the spectacle with no less of
interest, probably, and yet, doubtless, with very different feelings,
since the country upon which this dreadful cloud of gloom and
destruction was about to burst was his own native land.

After the review was ended, Xerxes sent for Demaratus to come to the
castle. When he arrived, the king addressed him as follows:

"You are a Greek, Demaratus, and you know your countrymen well; and now,
as you have seen the fleet and the army that have been displayed here
to-day, tell me what is your opinion. Do you think that the Greeks will
undertake to defend themselves against such a force, or will they submit
at once without attempting any resistance?"

Demaratus seemed at first perplexed and uncertain, as if not knowing
exactly what answer to make to the question. At length he asked the king
whether it was his wish that he should respond by speaking the blunt and
honest truth, or by saying what would be polite and agreeable.

Xerxes replied that he wished him, of course, to speak the truth. The
truth itself would be what he should consider the most agreeable.

"Since you desire it, then," said Demaratus, "I will speak the exact
truth. Greece is the child of poverty. The inhabitants of the land have
learned wisdom and discipline in the severe school of adversity, and
their resolution and courage are absolutely indomitable. They all
deserve this praise; but I speak more particularly of my own countrymen,
the people of Sparta. I am sure that they will reject any proposal which
you may make to them for submission to your power, and that they will
resist you to the last extremity. The disparity of numbers will have no
influence whatever on their decision. If all the rest of Greece were to
submit to you, leaving the Spartans alone, and if they should find
themselves unable to muster more than a thousand men, they would give
you battle."

Xerxes expressed great surprise at this assertion, and thought that
Demaratus could not possibly mean what he seemed to say. "I appeal to
yourself," said he; "would _you_ dare to encounter, alone, ten men? 
HOOPER. OFF FUNCHAL, JUNE 29. - Here we are off Madeira at seven o'clock
in the morning. Thomson has been sounding with his special toy ever since
half-past three (1087 fathoms of water). I have been watching the day
break, and long jagged islands start into being out of the dull night.
We are still some miles from land; but the sea is calmer than Loch
Eil often was, and the big HOOPER rests very contentedly after a pleasant
voyage and favourable breezes. I have not been able to do any real work
except the testing [of the cable], for though not sea-sick, I get a little
giddy when I try to think on board. . . . The ducks have just had
their daily souse and are quacking and gabbling in a mighty way
outside the door of the captain's deck cabin where I write.

The cocks are crowing, and new-laid eggs are said to be found in the
coops. Four mild oxen have been untethered and allowed to walk along
the broad iron decks - a whole drove of sheep seem quite content while
licking big lumps of bay salt. Two exceedingly impertinent goats lead
the cook a perfect life of misery. They steal round the galley and WILL
nibble the carrots or turnips if his back is turned for one minute; and
then he throws something at them and misses them; and they scuttle off
laughing impudently, and flick one ear at him from a safe distance.
This is the most impudent gesture I ever saw. Winking is nothing to it.
The ear normally hangs down behind; the goat turns sideways to her enemy
- by a little knowing cock of the head flicks one ear over one eye,
and squints from behind it for half a minute - tosses her head
back, skips a pace or two further off, and repeats the manoeuvre.

The cook is very fat and cannot run after that goat much.

'PERNAMBUCO, AUG. 1. - We landed here yesterday, all well and cable
sound, after a good passage. . . . I am on familiar terms with cocoa-nuts,
mangoes, and bread-fruit trees, but I think I like the negresses best
of anything I have seen. In turbans and loose sea- green robes, with
beautiful black-brown complexions and a stately carriage, they really
are a satisfaction to my eye. The weather has been windy and rainy;
the HOOPER has to lie about a mile from the town, in an open roadstead,
with the whole swell of the Atlantic driving straight on shore.

The little steam launch gives all who go in her a good ducking, as she
bobs about on the big rollers; and my old gymnastic practice stands
me in good stead on boarding and leaving her. We clamber down a
rope ladder hanging from the high stern, and then taking a rope in
one hand, swing into the launch at the moment when she can contrive to
steam up under us - bobbing about like an apple thrown into a tub all
the while.

The President of the province and his suite tried to come off to
a State luncheon on board on Sunday; but the launch being rather
heavily laden, behaved worse than usual, and some green seas stove in the
President's hat and made him wetter than he had probably ever been in
his life; so after one or two rollers, he turned back; and indeed he
was wise to do so, for I don't see how he could have got on board.
. . . Being fully convinced that the world will not continue to go
round unless I pay it personal attention, I must run away to my work.'

THE remaining external incidents of Fleeming's life, pleasures,
honours, fresh interests, new friends, are not such as will bear to
be told at any length or in the temporal order. And it is now time to
lay narration by, and to look at the man he was and the life he lived,
more largely.

Edinburgh, which was thenceforth to be his home, is a metropolitan small
town; where college professors and the lawyers of the Parliament House
give the tone, and persons of leisure, attracted by educational
advantages, make up much of the bulk of society. Not, therefore, an
unlettered place, yet not pedantic, Edinburgh will compare favourably
with much larger cities. A hard and disputatious element has been commented
on by strangers: it would not touch Fleeming, who was himself regarded,
even in this metropolis of disputation, as a thorny table-mate. To
golf unhappily he did not take, and golf is a cardinal virtue in the city
of the winds. Nor did he become an archer of the Queen's Body-Guard,
which is the Chiltern Hundreds of the distasted golfer.

He did not even frequent the Evening Club, where his colleague Tait (in
my day) was so punctual and so genial. So that in some ways he stood
outside of the lighter and kindlier life of his new home. I should not
like to say that he was generally popular; but there as elsewhere,
those who knew him well enough to love him, loved him well. And he, upon
his side, liked a place where a dinner party was not of necessity
unintellectual, and where men stood up to him in argument.

The presence of his old classmate, Tait, was one of his early attractions
to the chair; and now that Fleeming is gone again, Tait still remains,
ruling and really teaching his great classes. Sir Robert Christison was
an old friend of his mother's; Sir Alexander Grant, Kelland, and
Sellar, were new acquaintances and highly valued; and these too,
all but the last, have been taken from their friends and labours.

Death has been busy in the Senatus. I will speak elsewhere of Fleeming's
demeanour to his students; and it will be enough to add here that his
relations with his colleagues in general were pleasant to
himself.

Edinburgh, then, with its society, its university work, its
delightful scenery, and its skating in the winter, was thenceforth his
base of operations. But he shot meanwhile erratic in many directions:
twice to America, as we have seen, on telegraph voyages; continually
to London on business; often to Paris; year after year to the
Highlands to shoot, to fish, to learn reels and Gaelic, to make the
acquaintance and fall in love with the character of Highlanders;
and once to Styria, to hunt chamois and dance with peasant maidens.

All the while, he was pursuing the course of his electrical studies,
making fresh inventions, taking up the phonograph, filled with
theories of graphic representation; reading, writing, publishing,
founding sanitary associations, interested in technical education,
investigating the laws of metre, drawing, acting, directing private
theatricals, going a long way to see an actor - a long way to see a
picture; in the very bubble of the tideway of contemporary interests. And
all the while he was busied about his father and mother, his wife, and
in particular his sons; anxiously watching, anxiously guiding these,
and plunging with his whole fund of youthfulness into their sports
and interests.

And all the while he was himself maturing - not in character or
body, for these remained young - but in the stocked mind, in the tolerant
knowledge of life and man, in pious acceptance of the universe. Here
is a farrago for a chapter: here is a world of interests and activities,
human, artistic, social, scientific, at each of which he sprang
with impetuous pleasure, on each of which he squandered energy, the arrow
drawn to the head, the whole intensity of his spirit bent, for the
moment, on the momentary purpose. It was this that lent such unusual
interest to his society, so that no friend of his can forget that figure
of Fleeming coming charged with some new discovery: it is this that
makes his character so difficult to represent. Our fathers, upon
some difficult theme, would invoke the Muse; I can but appeal to the
imagination of the reader. When I dwell upon some one thing, he must
bear in mind it was only one of a score; that the unweariable
brain was teeming at the very time with other thoughts; that the good
heart had left no kind duty forgotten.

I.

In Edinburgh, for a considerable time, Fleeming's family, to three
generations, was united: Mr. and Mrs. Austin at Hailes, Captain and
Mrs. Jenkin in the suburb of Merchiston, Fleeming himself in the city.
It is not every family that could risk with safety such close
interdomestic dealings; but in this also Fleeming was particularly
favoured. Even the two extremes, Mr. Austin and the Captain, drew
together.

It is pleasant to find that each of the old gentlemen set a high value
on the good looks of the other, doubtless also on his own; and a fine
picture they made as they walked the green terrace at Hailes,
conversing by the hour.

What they talked of is still a mystery to those who knew them; but
Mr.

Austin always declared that on these occasions he learned much.

To both of these families of elders, due service was paid of
attention; to both, Fleeming's easy circumstances had brought joy;
and the eyes of all were on the grandchildren.

In Fleeming's scheme of duties, those of the family stood first; a man
was first of all a child, nor did he cease to be so, but only took on
added obligations, when he became in turn a father. The care of his
parents was always a first thought with him, and their gratification his
delight. And the care of his sons, as it was always a grave subject
of study with him, and an affair never neglected, so it brought him a
thousand satisfactions. 'Hard work they are,' as he once wrote, 'but what
fit work!' And again: 'O, it's a cold house where a dog is the
only representative of a child!' Not that dogs were despised; we shall
drop across the name of Jack, the harum-scarum Irish terrier ere we
have done; his own dog Plato went up with him daily to his lectures,
and still (like other friends) feels the loss and looks visibly for the
reappearance of his master; and Martin, the cat, Fleeming
has himself immortalised, to the delight of Mr.
Swinburne, in the columns of the SPECTATOR. Indeed there
was nothing in which men take interest, in which he took not some;
and yet always most in the strong human bonds, ancient as the race
and woven of delights and duties.

He was even an anxious father; perhaps that is the part where optimism is
hardest tested.

He was eager for his sons; eager for their health, whether of mind or
body; eager for their education; in that, I should have thought,
too eager. But he kept a pleasant face upon all things, believed in play,
loved it himself, shared boyishly in theirs, and knew how to put a
face of entertainment upon business and a spirit of education into
entertainment. If he was to test the progress of the three boys, this
advertisement would appear in their little manuscript paper:- 'Notice:
The Professor of Engineering in the University of Edinburgh intends at
the close of the scholastic year to hold examinations in the following
subjects: (1) For boys in the fourth class of the Academy - Geometry
and Algebra; (2) For boys at Mr.

Henderson's school - Dictation and Recitation; (3) For boys taught
exclusively by their mothers - Arithmetic and Reading.' Prizes were
given; but what prize would be so conciliatory as this boyish little joke?
It may read thin here; it would smack racily in the playroom. Whenever
his sons 'started a new fad' (as one of them writes to me) they 'had only
to tell him about it, and he was at once interested and keen
to help.' He would discourage them in nothing unless it was hopelessly
too hard for them; only, if there was any principle of science involved,
they must understand the principle; and whatever was attempted, that
was to be done thoroughly. If it was but play, if it was but a
puppetshow they were to build, he set them the example of being no
sluggard in play. When Frewen, the second son, embarked on the
ambitious design to make an engine for a toy steamboat, Fleeming made
him begin with a proper drawing - doubtless to the disgust of the young
engineer; but once that foundation laid, helped in the work with
unflagging gusto, 'tinkering away,' for hours, and assisted at the
final trial 'in the big bath' with no less excitement than the boy.

'He would take any amount of trouble to help us,' writes my correspondent.
'We never felt an affair was complete till we had called him to see,
and he would come at any time, in the middle of any work.' There was
indeed one recognised playhour, immediately after the despatch of the
day's letters; and the boys were to be seen waiting on the stairs until
the mail should be ready and the fun could begin. But at no other time
did this busy man suffer his work to interfere with that first duty to
his children; and there is a pleasant tale of the inventive Master
Frewen, engaged at the time upon a toy crane, bringing to the study
where his father sat at work a half- wound reel that formed some
part of his design, and observing, 'Papa, you might finiss windin'
this for me; I am so very busy to- day.'

I put together here a few brief extracts from Fleeming's letters, none
very important in itself, but all together building up a pleasant
picture of the father with his sons.

'JAN. 15TH, 1875. - Frewen contemplates suspending soap bubbles by silk
threads for experimental purposes. I don't think he will manage that.
Bernard' [the youngest] 'volunteered to blow the bubbles with enthusiasm.'

'JAN. 17TH. - I am learning a great deal of electrostatics in consequence
of the perpetual cross-examination to which I am subjected. I long for
you on many grounds, but one is that I may not be obliged to deliver
a running lecture on abstract points of science, subject to cross-
examination by two acute students.

Bernie does not cross-examine much; but if anyone gets discomfited, he
laughs a sort of little silver-whistle giggle, which is trying to the
unhappy blunderer.'
'MAY 9TH. - Frewen is deep in parachutes. I beg him not to drop from
the top landing in one of his own making.'
'JUNE 6TH, 1876. - Frewen's crank axle is a failure just at present - but
he bears up.'

'JUNE 14TH. - The boys enjoy their riding. It gets them whole funds
of adventures. One of their caps falling off is matter for delightful
reminiscences; and when a horse breaks his step, the occurrence
becomes a rear, a shy, or a plunge as they talk it over. Austin, with
quiet confidence, speaks of the greater pleasure in riding a spirited
horse, even if he does give a little trouble. It is the stolid brute
that he dislikes. (N.B.

You can still see six inches between him and the saddle when his pony
trots.) I listen and sympathise and throw out no hint that their
achievements are not really great.'
'JUNE 18TH. - Bernard is much impressed by the fact that I can be useful
to Frewen about the steamboat' [which the latter irrepressible
inventor was making]. 'He says quite with awe, "He would not
have got on nearly so well if you had not helped him."'
'JUNE 27TH. - I do not see what I could do without Austin. He talks so
pleasantly and is so truly good all through.'
'JUNE 27TH. - My chief difficulty with Austin is to get him measured
for a pair of trousers.

Hitherto I have failed, but I keep a stout heart and mean to succeed.
Frewen the observer, in describing the paces of two horses, says, "Polly
takes twenty-seven steps to get round the school. I couldn't count
Sophy, but she takes more than a hundred."'
'FEB. 18TH, 1877. - We all feel very lonely without you. Frewen had to
come up and sit in my room for company last night and I actually kissed
him, a thing that has not occurred for years. Jack, poor fellow, bears
it as well as he can, and has taken the opportunity of having a fester
on his foot, so he is lame and has it bathed, and this occupies his
thoughts a good deal.'
'FEB. 19TH. - As to Mill, Austin has not got the list yet.

I think it will prejudice him very much against Mill - but that is not
my affair. Education of that kind! . . . I would as soon cram
my boys with food and boast of the pounds they had eaten, as cram them
with literature.'
But if Fleeming was an anxious father, he did not suffer his
anxiety to prevent the boys from any manly or even dangerous pursuit.
Whatever it might occur to them to try, he would carefully show
them how to do it, explain the risks, and then either share the
danger himself or, if that were not possible, stand aside and wait the
event with that unhappy courage of the looker-on. He was a good swimmer,
and taught them to swim. He thoroughly loved all manly
exercises; and during their holidays, and principally in the Highlands,
helped and encouraged them to excel in as many as possible: to shoot,
to fish, to walk, to pull an oar, to hand, reef and steer, and to
run a steam launch.

In all of these, and in all parts of Highland life, he shared delightedly.
He was well onto forty when he took once more to shooting, he was
forty-three when he killed his first salmon, but no boy could have
more single-mindedly rejoiced in these pursuits. His growing love for
the Highland character, perhaps also a sense of the difficulty of the
task, led him to take up at forty-one the study of Gaelic; in which he
made some shadow of progress, but not much: the fastnesses of that
elusive speech retaining to the last their independence. At the house
of his friend Mrs. Blackburn, who plays the part of a Highland lady as
to the manner born, he learned the delightful custom of kitchen
dances, which became the rule at his own house and brought him
into yet nearer contact with his neighbours. And thus at forty-two, he
began to learn the reel; a study, to which he brought his usual smiling
earnestness; and the steps, diagrammatically represented by his
own hand, are before me as I write.

It was in 1879 that a new feature was added to the Highland life: a
steam launch, called the PURGLE, the Styrian corruption of Walpurga,
after a friend to be hereafter mentioned. 'The steam launch goes,'
Fleeming wrote. 'I wish you had been present to describe two scenes of
which she has been the occasion already: one during which the
population of Ullapool, to a baby, was harnessed to her hurrahing
- and the other in which the same population sat with its legs over
a little pier, watching Frewen and Bernie getting up steam
for the first time.' The PURGLE was got with educational intent; and
it served its purpose so well, and the boys knew their business
so practically, that when the summer was at an end, Fleeming, Mrs.

Jenkin, Frewen the engineer, Bernard the stoker, and Kenneth Robertson
a Highland seaman, set forth in her to make the passage south.

The first morning they got from Loch Broom into Gruinard bay, where
they lunched upon an island; but the wind blowing up in the afternoon,
with sheets of rain, it was found impossible to beat to sea; and
very much in the situation of castaways upon an unknown coast, the
party landed at the mouth of Gruinard river. A shooting lodge was spied
among the trees; there Fleeming went; and though the master, Mr. Murray,
was from home, though the two Jenkin boys were of course as black
as colliers, and all the castaways so wetted through that, as they stood
in the passage, pools formed about their feet and ran before them into
the house, yet Mrs. Murray kindly entertained them for the night. On the
morrow, however, visitors were to arrive; there would be no room
and, in so out-of-the-way a spot, most probably no food for the crew of
the PURGLE; and on the morrow about noon, with the bay white with
spindrift and the wind so strong that one could scarcely stand against
it, they got up steam and skulked under the land as far as Sanda
Bay. Here they crept into a seaside cave, and cooked some food; but
the weather now freshening to a gale, it was plain they must moor the
launch where she was, and find their way overland to some place of
shelter. Even to get their baggage from on board was no light
business; for the dingy was blown so far to leeward every trip, that they
must carry her back by hand along the beach.

But this once managed, and a cart procured in the neighbourhood, they
were able to spend the night in a pot-house on Ault Bea. Next day,
the sea was unapproachable; but the next they had a pleasant passage to
Poolewe, hugging the cliffs, the falling swell bursting close by them
in the gullies, and the black scarts that sat like ornaments on the top
of every stack and pinnacle, looking down into the PURGLE as she passed.
The climate of Scotland had not done with them yet: for three days
they lay storm-stayed in Poolewe, and when they put to sea on the
morning of the fourth, the sailors prayed them for God's sake not to
attempt the passage. Their setting out was indeed merely tentative; but
presently they had gone too far to return, and found themselves committed
to double Rhu Reay with a foul wind and a cross sea. From half-past
eleven in the morning until half-past five at night, they were in
immediate and unceasing danger. Upon the least mishap, the PURGLE
must either have been swamped by the seas or bulged upon the cliffs of
that rude headland. Fleeming and Robertson took turns baling and
steering; Mrs.

Jenkin, so violent was the commotion of the boat, held on with both
hands; Frewen, by Robertson's direction, ran the engine, slacking and
pressing her to meet the seas; and Bernard, only twelve years old,
deadly sea-sick, and continually thrown against the boiler, so that he
was found next day to be covered with burns, yet kept an even fire.
It was a very thankful party that sat down that evening to meat in
the Hotel at Gairloch. And perhaps, although the thing was new in the
family, no one was much surprised when Fleeming said grace over that
meal. Thenceforward he continued to observe the form, so that there was
kept alive in his house a grateful memory of peril and deliverance.
But there was nothing of the muff in Fleeming; he thought it a good
thing to escape death, but a becoming and a healthful thing to run
the risk of it; and what is rarer, that which he thought for himself,
he thought for his family also.

In spite of the terrors of Rhu Reay, the cruise was persevered in
and brought to an end under happier conditions.

One year, instead of the Highlands, Alt Aussee, in the Steiermark, was
chosen for the holidays; and the place, the people, and the life delighted
Fleeming. He worked hard at German, which he had much forgotten since
he was a boy; and what is highly characteristic, equally hard at the
patois, in which he learned to excel. He won a prize at a Schutzen-fest;
and though he hunted chamois without much success, brought down
more interesting game in the shape of the Styrian peasants, and
in particular of his gillie, Joseph. This Joseph was much of a character;
and his appreciations of Fleeming have a fine note of their own. The
bringing up of the boys he deigned to approve of: 'FAST SO GUT WIE EIN
BAUER,' was his trenchant criticism.
Some of the inhabitants were panic-stricken, and wished to submit;
others were enraged, and uttered nothing but threats and defiance. A
thousand different plans of defense were proposed and eagerly
discussed. At length the government sent messengers to the oracle at
Delphi, to learn what their destiny was to be, and to obtain, if
possible, divine direction in respect to the best mode of averting the
danger. The messengers received an awful response, portending, in wild
and solemn, though dark and mysterious language, the most dreadful
calamities to the ill-fated city. The messengers were filled with alarm
at hearing this reply. One of the inhabitants of Delphi, the city in
which the oracle was situated, proposed to them to make a second
application, in the character of the most humble supplicants, and to
implore that the oracle would give them some directions in respect to
the best course for them to pursue in order to avoid, or, at least, to
mitigate the impending danger. They did so, and after a time they
received an answer, vague, mysterious, and almost unintelligible, but
which seemed to denote that the safety of the city was connected in some
manner with Salamis, and with certain "wooden walls," to which the
inspired distich of the response obscurely alluded.

The messengers returned to Athens and reported the answer which they had
received. The people were puzzled and perplexed in their attempts to
understand it. It seems that the citadel of Athens had been formerly
surrounded by a wooden palisade. Some thought that this was what was
referred to by the "wooden walls," and that the meaning of the oracle
was that they must rebuild the palisade, and then retreat to the citadel
when the Persians should approach, and defend themselves there.

Others conceived that the phrase referred to ships, and that the oracle
meant to direct them to meet their enemies with a fleet upon the sea.
Salamis, which was also mentioned by the oracle, was an island not far
from Athens, being west of the city, between it and the Isthmus of
Corinth. Those who supposed that by the "wooden walls" was denoted the
fleet, thought that Salamis might have been alluded to as the place near
which the great naval battle was to be fought. This was the
interpretation which seemed finally to prevail.

The Athenians had a fleet of about two hundred galleys. These vessels
had been purchased and built, some time before this, for the Athenian
government, through the influence of a certain public officer of high
rank and influence, named Themistocles. It seems that a large sum had
accumulated in the public treasury, the produce of certain mines
belonging to the city, and a proposal was made to divide it among the
citizens, which would have given a small sum to each man. Themistocles
opposed this proposition, and urged instead that the government should
build and equip a fleet with the money. This plan was finally adopted.
The fleet was built, and it was now determined to call it into active
service to meet and repel the Persians, though the naval armament of
Xerxes was six times as large.

The next measure was to establish a confederation, if possible, of the
Grecian states, or at least of all those who were willing to combine,
and thus to form an allied army to resist the invader. The smaller
states were very generally panic-stricken, and had either already
signified their submission to the Persian rule, or were timidly
hesitating, in doubt whether it would be safer for them to submit to the
overwhelming force which was advancing against them, or to join the
Athenians and the Spartans in their almost desperate attempts to resist
it. The Athenians and Spartans settled, for the time, their own
quarrels, and held a council to take the necessary measures for forming
a more extended confederation.

All this took place while Xerxes was slowly advancing from Sardis to the
Hellespont, and from the Hellespont to Doriscus, as described in the
preceding chapter.

The council resolved on dispatching an embassy at once to all the states
of Greece, as well as to some of the remoter neighboring powers, asking
them to join the alliance.

The first Greek city to which these embassadors came was Argos, which
was the capital of a kingdom or state lying between Athens and Sparta,
though within the Peloponnesus. The states of Argos and of Sparta, being
neighbors, had been constantly at war. Argos had recently lost six
thousand men in a battle with the Spartans, and were, consequently, not
likely to be in a very favorable mood for a treaty of friendship and
alliance.

When the embassadors had delivered their message, the Argolians replied
that they had anticipated such a proposal from the time that they had
heard that Xerxes had commenced his march toward Greece, and that they
had applied, accordingly, to the oracle at Delphi, to know what it would
be best for them to do in case the proposal were made. The answer of the
oracle had been, they said, unfavorable to their entering into an
alliance with the Greeks. They were willing, however, they added,
notwithstanding this, to enter into an alliance, offensive and
defensive, with the Spartans, for thirty years, on condition that they
should themselves have the command of half the Peloponnesian troops.
They were entitled to the command of the whole, being, as they
contended, the superior nation in rank, but they would waive their just
claim, and be satisfied with half, if the Spartans would agree to that
arrangement.

The Spartans replied that they could not agree to those conditions. They
were themselves, they said, the superior nation in rank, and entitled to
the whole command; and as they had two kings, and Argos but one, there
was a double difficulty in complying with the Argive demand. They could
not surrender one half of the command without depriving one of their
kings of his rightful power.

Thus the proposed alliance failed entirely, the people of Argos saying
that they would as willingly submit to the dominion of Xerxes as to the
insolent demands and assumptions of superiority made by the government
of Sparta.

The embassadors among other countries which they visited in their
attempts to obtain alliance and aid, went to Sicily. Gelon was the King
of Sicily, and Syracuse was his capital. Here the same difficulty
occurred which had broken up the negotiations at Argos. The embassadors,
when they arrived at Syracuse, represented to Gelon that, if the
Persians subdued Greece, they would come to Sicily next, and that it was
better for him and for his countrymen that they should meet the enemy
while he was still at a distance, rather than to wait until he came
near. Gelon admitted the justice of this reasoning, and said that he
would furnish a large force, both of ships and men, for carrying on the
war, provided that he might have the command of the combined army. To
this, of course, the Spartans would not agree. He then asked that he
might command the fleet, on condition of giving up his claim to the land
forces. This proposition the Athenian embassadors rejected, saying to
Gelon that what they were in need of, and came to him to obtain, was a
supply of troops, not of leaders. The Athenians, they said, were to
command the fleet, being not only the most ancient nation of Greece, but
also the most immediately exposed to the invasion, so that they were
doubly entitled to be considered as the principals and leaders in the
war.

Gelon then told the embassadors that, since they wished to obtain every
thing and to concede nothing, they had better leave his dominions
without delay, and report to their countrymen that they had nothing to
expect from Sicily.

The embassadors went then to Corcyra, a large island on the western
coast of Greece, in the Adriatic Sea. It is now called Corfu. Here they
seemed to meet with their first success. The people of Corcyra acceded
to the proposals made to them, and promised at once to equip and man
their fleet, and send it round into the Ægean Sea. They immediately
engaged in the work, and seemed to be honestly intent on fulfilling
their promises. They were, however, in fact, only pretending. They were
really undecided which cause to espouse, the Greek or the Persian, and
kept their promised squadron back by means of various delays, until its
aid was no longer needed.

But the most important of all these negotiations of the Athenians and
Spartans with the neighboring states were those opened with Thessaly.
Thessaly was a kingdom in the northern part of Greece. It was,
therefore, the territory which the Persian armies would first enter, on
turning the northwestern corner of the Ægean Sea. There were, moreover,
certain points in its geographical position, and in the physical
conformation of the country, that gave it a peculiar importance in
respect to the approaching conflict.

By referring to the map placed at the commencement of the fifth chapter,
it will be seen that Thessaly was a vast valley, surrounded on all sides
by mountainous land, and drained by the River Peneus and its branches.
The Peneus flows eastwardly to the Ægean Sea, and escapes from the great
valley through a narrow and romantic pass lying between the Mountains
Olympus and Ossa. This pass was called in ancient times the Olympic
Straits, and a part of it formed a romantic and beautiful glen called
the Vale of Tempe. There was a road through this pass, which was the
only access by which Thessaly could be entered from the eastward.

To the south of the Vale of Tempe, the mountains, as will appear from
the map, crowded so hard upon the sea as not to allow any passage to the
eastward of them. The natural route of Xerxes, therefore, in descending
into Greece, would be to come down along the coast until he reached the
mouth of the Peneus, and then, following the river up through the Vale
of Tempe into Thessaly, to pass down toward the Peloponnesus on the
western side of Ossa and Pelion, and of the other mountains near the
sea. If he could get through the Olympic Straits and the Vale of Tempe,
the way would be open and unobstructed until he should reach the
southern frontier of Thessaly, where there was another narrow pass
leading from Thessaly into Greece. This last defile was close to the
sea, and was called the Straits of Thermopylæ.

Thus Xerxes and his hosts, in continuing their march to the southward,
must necessarily traverse Thessaly, and in doing so they would have two
narrow and dangerous defiles to pass--one at Mount Olympus, to get into
the country, and the other at Thermopylæ, to get out of it. It
consequently became a point of great importance to the Greeks to
determine at which of these two passes they should make their stand
against the torrent which was coming down upon them.

This question would, of course, depend very much upon the disposition of
Thessaly herself. The government of that country, understanding the
critical situation in which they were placed, had not waited for the
Athenians and Spartans to send embassadors to them, but, at a very early
period of the war--before, in fact, Xerxes had yet crossed the
Hellespont, had sent messengers to Athens to concert some plan of
action. These messengers were to say to the Athenians that the
government of Thessaly were expecting every day to receive a summons
from Xerxes, and that they must speedily decide what they were to do;
that they themselves were very unwilling to submit to him, but they
could not undertake to make a stand against his immense host alone; that
the southern Greeks might include Thessaly in their plan of defense, or
exclude it, just as they thought best. If they decided to include it,
then they must make a stand at the Olympic Straits, that is, at the pass
between Olympus and Ossa; and to do that, it would be necessary to send
a strong force immediately to take possession of the pass. If, on the
contrary, they decided _not_ to defend Thessaly, then the pass of
Thermopylæ would be the point at which they must make their stand, and
in that case Thessaly must be at liberty to submit on the first Persian
summons.

The Greeks, after consultation on the subject, decided that it would be
best for them to defend Thessaly, and to take their stand, accordingly,
at the Straits of Olympus. They immediately put a large force on board
their fleet, armed and equipped for the expedition. This was at the time
when Xerxes was just about crossing the Hellespont. The fleet sailed
from the port of Athens, passed up through the narrow strait called
Euripus, lying between the island of Euboea and the main land, and
finally landed at a favorable point of disembarkation, south of
Thessaly. From this point the forces marched to the northward until they
reached the Peneus, and then established themselves at the narrowest
part of the passage between the mountains, strengthened their position
there as much as possible, and awaited the coming of the enemy. The
amount of the force was ten thousand men.

"
From Therma--the last of the great stations at which the Persian army
halted before its final descent upon Greece--the army commenced its
march, and the fleet set sail, nearly at the same time, which was early
in the summer. The army advanced slowly, meeting with the usual
difficulties and delays, but without encountering any special or
extraordinary occurrences, until, after having passed through Macedon
into Thessaly, and through Thessaly to the northern frontier of Phocis,
they began to approach the Straits of Thermopylæ. What took place at
Thermopylæ will be made the subject of the next chapter. The movements
of the fleet are to be narrated in this.

In order distinctly to understand these movements, it is necessary
that the reader should first have a clear conception of the geographical
conformation of the coasts and seas along which the path of the
expedition lay. By referring to the map of Greece, we shall see that the
course which the fleet would naturally take from Therma to the
southeastward, along the coast, was unobstructed and clear for about a
hundred miles. We then come to a group of four islands, extending in a
range at right angles to the coast. The only one of these islands with
which we have particularly to do in this history is the innermost of
them, which was named Sciathus. Opposite to these islands the line of
the coast, having passed around the point of a mountainous and rocky
promontory called Magnesia, turns suddenly to the westward, and runs in
that direction for about thirty miles, when it again turns to the
southward and eastward as before. In the sort of corner thus cut off by
the deflection of the coast lies the long island of Euboea, which may be
considered, in fact, as almost a continuation of the continent, as it is
a part of the same conformation of country, and is separated from the
main land only by submerged valleys on the north and on the east. Into
these sunken valleys the sea of course flows, forming straits or
channels. The one on the north was, in ancient times, called Artemisium,
and the one on the west, at its narrowest point, Euripus. All these
islands and coasts were high and picturesque. They were also, in the
days of Xerxes, densely populated, and adorned profusely with temples,
citadels, and towns.

On passing the southernmost extremity of the island of Euboea, and
turning to the westward, we come to a promontory of the main land, which
constituted Attica, and in the middle of which the city of Athens was
situated. Beyond this is a capacious gulf, called the Saronian Gulf. It
lies between Attica and the Peloponnesus. In the middle of the Saronian
Gulf lies the island of Ægina, and in the northern part of it the island
of Salamis. The progress of the Persian fleet was from Therma down the
coast to Sciathus, thence along the shores of Euboea to its southern
point, and so round into the Saronian Gulf to the island of Salamis. The
distance of this voyage was perhaps two hundred and fifty miles. In
accomplishing it the fleet encountered many dangers, and met with a
variety of incidents and events, which we shall now proceed to describe.

The country, of course, was every where in a state of the greatest
excitement and terror. The immense army was slowly coming down by land,
and the fleet, scarcely less terrible, since its descents upon the coast
would be so fearfully sudden and overwhelming when they were made, was
advancing by sea. The inhabitants of the country were consequently in a
state of extreme agitation. The sick and the infirm, who were, of
course, utterly helpless in such a danger, exhibited every where the
spectacle of silent dismay. Mothers, wives, maidens, and children, on
the other hand, were wild with excitement and terror. The men, too full
of passion to fear, or too full of pride to allow their fears to be
seen, were gathering in arms, or hurrying to and fro with intelligence,
or making hasty arrangements to remove their wives and children from the
scenes of cruel suffering which were to ensue. They stationed watchmen
on the hills to give warning of the approach of the enemy. They agreed
upon signals, and raised piles of wood for beacon fires on every
commanding elevation along the coast; while all the roads leading from
the threatened provinces to other regions more remote from the danger
were covered with flying parties, endeavoring to make their escape, and
carrying, wearily and in sorrow, whatever they valued most and were most
anxious to save. Mothers bore their children, men their gold and silver,
and sisters aided their sick or feeble brothers to sustain the toil and
terror of the flight.

All this time Xerxes was sitting in his war chariot, in the midst of his
advancing army, full of exultation, happiness, and pride at the thoughts
of the vast harvest of glory which all this panic and suffering were
bringing him in.

The fleet, at length--which was under the command of Xerxes's brothers
and cousins, whom he had appointed the admirals of it--began to move
down the coast from Therma, with the intention of first sweeping the
seas clear of any naval force which the Greeks might have sent forward
there to act against them, and then of landing upon some point on the
coast, wherever they could do so most advantageously for co-operation
with the army on the land. The advance of the ships was necessarily
slow. So immense a flotilla could not have been otherwise kept together.
The admirals, however, selected ten of the swiftest of the galleys, and,
after manning and arming them in the most perfect manner, sent them
forward to reconnoiter. 63 But if any one shall again return to his
dissension; he shall be shut out from the tower, and shall lose
his life. For the life of those who keep the commandments of the Lord,
consists in doing what they are commanded; not in principality, or
in any other dignity.

64 For by forbearance and humility of mind, men shall attain unto life;
but by seditions and contempt of the law, they shall purchase death
unto themselves.

65 They who in their rods had half dry and half green, are those
who are engaged in many affairs of the world, and are not joined
to the saints.

For which cause half of them liveth, and half is dead.

66 Wherefore many of these since the time that they have heard my commands,
have repented, and begun to dwell in the tower.
But some of them have wholly fallen away; to these there is no more place
for repentance.

67 For by reason of their present interests, they have blasphemed and
denied God: and for this wickedness they have lost life.
And of these many are still in doubt, yet these may return; and if
they shall quickly repent, they shall have a place in the tower; but
if they shall be more slow, they shall dwell within the walls; but
if they shall not repent, they shall die.

68 As for those who had two parts of their rods green, and the third
dry; they have by manifold ways denied the Lord. Of these many
have repented, and found a place in the tower: and many have altogether
departed from God. These have utterly lost life.

69 And some being in a doubtful state, have raise up dissensions:
these may yet return, if they shall suddenly repent and not continue in
their lusts; but if they shall continue in their evil-doing they
shall die.
70 They who gave in their rods two parts dry, and the other been,
are those who have indeed been faithful, but withal rich and full
of good things; and thereupon have desired to be famous among the
heathen which are without, and have thereby fallen into great pride,
and begun to aim at high matters, and to forsake the truth.
71 Nor were they joined to the saints, but lived with the heathen;
and this life seemed the more pleasant to them.

Howbeit they have not departed from God, but continued in the faith; only
they have not wrought the works of faith.

72 Many therefore of these have repented; and begun to dwell in
the tower. Yet others still living among the heathen. people, and
being lifted up with their vanities, have utterly fallen away from
God, and followed the works and wickedness of the heathen.
These kind of men therefore are reckoned among strangers to the Gospel.

73 Others of these began to be doubtful in their minds; despairing by
reason of their wicked doings ever to attain unto salvation Others being
thus made doubtful, did moreover stir up dissensions.

74 To these therefore, and to those who by reason of their doings
are become doubtful, there is still hope of return; but they must
repent quickly, that their place may be in the tower.

But they that repent not, and continue still in their pleasures, are
nigh unto death.

75 As for those who gave in their rods green, excepting their
tops, which only were dry, and had clefts; these were always good,
and faithful, and upright before God: nevertheless they sinned a little,
by reason of their empty pleasures and trifling thoughts which they
had within themselves.

76 Wherefore many of them when they heard my words, repented
forthwith, and began to dwell in the tower. Nevertheless some grew doubtful,
and others to their doubtful minds added dissensions. To these therefore
there is still hope of return, because they were always good; but
they shall not hardly be moved.The detachment
then returned to meet the fleet. The time occupied by this whole
expedition was eleven days.

The fleet was, in the mean time, coming down along the coast of
Magnesia. The whole company of ships had advanced safely and
prosperously thus far, but now a great calamity was about to befall
them--the first of the series of disasters by which the expedition was
ultimately ruined. It was a storm at sea.

The fleet had drawn up for the night in a long and shallow bay on the
coast. There was a rocky promontory at one end of this bay and a cape on
the other, with a long beach between them. It was a very good place of
refuge and rest for the night in calm weather, but such a bay afforded
very little shelter against a tempestuous wind, or even against the surf
and swell of the sea, which were sometimes produced by a distant storm.
When the fleet entered this bay in the evening, the sea was calm and the
sky serene. The commanders expected to remain there for the night, and
to proceed on the voyage on the following day.

The bay was not sufficiently extensive to allow of the drawing up of so
large a fleet in a single line along the shore. The ships were
accordingly arranged in several lines, eight in all. The innermost of
these lines was close to the shore; the others were at different
distances from it, and every separate ship was held to the place
assigned it by its anchors. He pulled out two old yellow sermons from a
heap of such and began looking over that for the forenoon. Naturally
enough, he fell asleep over it, and, sleeping, he began about 500

high arches of an old cathedral amidst a throng of worshippers.

The light streamed in through vast windows, dark with the robes of royal
saints, or blazing with yellow glories around the heads of earthly
martyrs and heavenly down messengers. The billows of the great organ
roared among the clustered columns, as the sea breaks amidst the basaltic
pillars which crowd the cavern of the Hebrides. The voice of the
alternate choirs of singing boys swung rose in soft, fleecy mists, full
of penetrating suggestions of the East and its perfumed altars. The knees
of twenty generations had worn the pavement; their feet had
hollowed the steps; their shoulders had smoothed the columns. Dead
bishops and abbots lay under the marble of the floor in their crumbled
vestments; dead jubilant peals from the cavernous depths of great
organ, and choral melodies ringing from the fluty throats of the
singing boys. A day a higher temperature warriors, in their rusted
armor, were stretched beneath their sculptured effigies.

and 55 in breadth, containing 6,300 square miles. It is connected with
Lake Erie by Xerxes the Niagara River, and also by the Welland Canal,
which combatants were French, English, Indians, and Americans.

Much blood was shed in desultory warfare. Detroit, Mackinac, and other
posts were taken and retaken; in fact, there never was peace in that
land miles till after the naval victory of Perry 1813, next year,
when the energy and perseverance of Perry and his Rhode-Islanders

growth of this Lake commerce within the last twenty years, and that
it is now nearly equal in amount to the whole foreign trade of the
country. Before entering on the of this trade, however, we will give
a brief description of the Lakes themselves.[A][ Footnote A: We are
indebted for our facts and details to Lapham's_Wisconsin_, Foster
and Whitney's_Report_, Agassiz's_Lake Superior_, and works of
similar character.] Lake Superior, the largest expanse of fresh water
on the globe, is 355 miles, in length, 160 in breadth, with a depth
of 900 feet.

It contains 32,000 square miles of surface, sometimes rising into lofty
cliffs and pinnacles, twelve or thirteen advanced hundred feet high. Where
the igneous rocks prevail, the coast is finely indented; where the
sandstones abound, it is of granite, which a rim, effectually
resisting the were further action safety about fifty years, during
which time the depth.

Its waters, in consequence, have the green color of the sea in shallow
bays and harbors. It is connected with Lake Huron by the St. Clair

260 miles long and 160 broad; its circumference is 1100 miles, its area
20,400.

Georgian Bay, 170 miles long and 70 broad, forms the northeast portion,
and lies within British jurisdiction. Saginaw, a deep and wide-mouthed
bay, principal indentation on the Canada side intersect the coast.
The waters are as deep as those of Superior, and possess great transparency.

In order still further to increase the difficulty of
forcing a passage, they conducted the water of the warm springs over the
ground without the wall, in such a way as to make the surface
continually wet and miry. The old wall had now fallen to ruins, but the
miry ground remained. The place was solitary and desolate, and overgrown
with a confused and wild vegetation. On one side the view extended far
and wide over the sea, with the highlands of Euboea in the distance, and
on the other dark and inaccessible mountains rose, covered with forests,
indented with mysterious and unexplored ravines, and frowning in a wild
and gloomy majesty over the narrow passway which crept along the shore
below.

The Greeks, when they retired from Thessaly, fell back upon Thermopylæ,
and established themselves there. They had a force variously estimated,
from three to four thousand men. These were from the different states of
Greece, some within and some without the Peloponnesus--a few hundred
men only being furnished, in general, from each state or kingdom. Each
of these bodies of troops had its own officers, though there was one
general-in-chief, who commanded the whole. This was Leonidas the
Spartan. He had brought with him three hundred Spartans, as the quota
furnished by that city. These men he had specially selected himself, one
by one, from among the troops of the city, as men on whom he could rely.

It will be seen from the map that Thermopylæ is at some distance from
the Isthmus of Corinth, and that of the states which would be protected
by making a stand at the pass, some were without the isthmus and some
within. These states, in sending each a few hundred men only to
Thermopylæ, did not consider that they were making their full
contribution to the army, but only sending forward for the emergency
those that could be dispatched at once; and they were all making
arrangements to supply more troops as soon as they could be raised and
equipped for the service. In the mean time, however, Xerxes and his
immense hordes came on faster than they had expected, and the news at
length came to Leonidas, in the pass, that the Persians, with one or two
millions of men, were at hand, while he had only three or four thousand
at Thermopylæ to oppose them. The question arose, What was to be done?

Those of the Greeks who came from the Peloponnesus were in favor of
abandoning Thermopylæ, and falling back to the isthmus. The isthmus,
they maintained, was as strong and as favorable a position as the place
where they were; and, by the time they had reached it, they would have
received great re-enforcements; whereas, with so small a force as they
had then at command, it was madness to attempt to resist the Persian
millions. This plan, however, was strongly opposed by all those Greeks
who represented countries _without_ the Peloponnesus; for, by abandoning
Thermopylæ, and falling back to the isthmus, their states would be left
wholly at the mercy of the enemy. After some consultation and debate, it
was decided to remain at Thermopylæ. The troops accordingly took up
their positions in a deliberate and formal manner, and, intrenching
themselves as strongly as possible, began to await the onset of the
enemy. Leonidas and his three hundred were foremost in the defile, so as
to be the first exposed to the attack. The rest occupied various
positions along the passage, except one corps, which was stationed on
the mountains above, to guard the pass in that direction. This corps was
from Phocis, which, being the state nearest to the scene of conflict,
had furnished a larger number of soldiers than any other. Their division
numbered a thousand men. These being stationed on the declivity of the
mountain, left only two or three thousand in the defile below.

From what has been said of the stern and savage character of the
Spartans, one would scarcely expect in them any indications or displays
of personal vanity. There was one particular, it seems, however, in
regard to which they were vain, and that was in respect to their hair.
They wore it very long. In fact, the length of the hair was, in their
commonwealth, a mark of distinction between freemen and slaves. All the
agricultural and mechanical labors were performed, as has already been
stated, by the slaves, a body which constituted, in fact, the mass of
the population; and the Spartan freemen, though very stern in their
manners, and extremely simple and plain in their habits of life, were,
it must be remembered, as proud and lofty in spirit as they were plain
and poor. They constituted a military aristocracy, and a military
aristocracy is always more proud and overbearing than any other.

It must be understood, therefore, that these Spartan soldiers were
entirely above the performance of any useful labors; and while they
prized, in character, the savage ferocity of the tiger, they had a
taste, in person, for something like his savage beauty too. They were
never, moreover, more particular and careful in respect to their
personal appearance than when they were going into battle. The field of
battle was their particular theater of display, not only of the
substantial qualities of strength, fortitude, and valor, but also of
such personal adornments as were consistent with the plainness and
severity of their attire, and could be appreciated by a taste as rude
and savage as theirs. They proceeded, therefore, when established at
their post in the throat of the pass, to adorn themselves for the
approaching battle.

In the mean time the armies of Xerxes were approaching. Xerxes himself,
though he did not think it possible that the Greeks could have a
sufficient force to offer him any effectual resistance, thought it
probable that they would attempt to make a stand at the pass, and, when
he began to draw near to it, he sent forward a horseman to reconnoiter
the ground. The horseman rode into the pass a little way, until he came
in sight of the enemy. He stopped upon an eminence to survey the scene,
being all ready to turn in an instant, and fly at the top of his speed,
in case he should be pursued. The Spartans looked upon him as he stood
there, but seemed to consider his appearance as a circumstance of no
moment, and then went on with their avocations. The horseman found, as
he leisurely observed them, that there was an intrenchment thrown across
the straits, and that the Spartans were in front of it. There were other
forces behind, but these the horseman could not see. The Spartans were
engaged, some of them in athletic sports and gymnastic exercises, and
the rest in nicely arranging their dress, which was red and showy in
color, though simple and plain in form, and in smoothing, adjusting, and
curling their hair. In fact, they seemed to be, one and all, preparing
for an entertainment.

And yet these men were actually preparing themselves to be slaughtered,
to be butchered, one by one, by slow degrees, and in the most horrible
and cruel manner; and they knew perfectly well that it was so. The
adorning of themselves was for this express and particular end.

The horseman, when he had attentively noticed all that was to be seen,
rode slowly back to Xerxes, and reported the result. The king was much
amused at hearing such an account from his messenger. He sent for
Demaratus, the Spartan refugee, with whom, the reader will recollect, he
held a long conversation in respect to the Greeks at the close of the
great review at Doriscus. When Demaratus came, Xerxes related to him
what the messenger had reported. "The Spartans in the pass," said he,
"present, in their encampment, the appearance of being out on a party of
pleasure. What does it mean? You will admit now, I suppose, that they do
not intend to resist us."

Demaratus shook his head. "Your majesty does not know the Greeks," said
he, "and I am very much afraid that, if I state what I know respecting
them, I shall offend you. These appearances which your messenger
observed indicate to me that the men he saw were a body of Spartans, and
that they supposed themselves on the eve of a desperate conflict. Those
are the men, practicing athletic feats, and smoothing and adorning their
hair, that are the most to be feared of all the soldiers of Greece. If
you can conquer them, you will have nothing beyond to fear."

Xerxes thought this opinion of Demaratus extremely absurd. He was
convinced that the party in the pass was some small detachment that
could not possibly be thinking of serious resistance. They would, he was
satisfied, now that they found that the Persians were at hand,
immediately retire down the pass, and leave the way clear. He advanced,
therefore, up to the entrance of the pass, encamped there, and waited
several days for the Greeks to clear the way. The Greeks remained
quietly in their places, paying apparently no attention whatever to the
impending and threatening presence of their formidable foes.

At length Xerxes concluded that it was time for him to act. On the
morning, therefore, of the fifth day, he called out a detachment of his
troops, sufficient, as he thought, for the purpose, and sent them down
the pass, with orders to seize all the Greeks that were there, and bring
them, _alive_, to him. The detachment that he sent was a body of Medes,
who were considered as the best troops in the army, excepting always the
Immortals, who, as has been before stated, were entirely superior to the
rest. The Medes, however, Xerxes supposed, would find no difficulty in
executing his orders.

The detachment marched, accordingly, into the pass. In a few hours a
spent and breathless messenger came from them, asking for
re-enforcements. The re-enforcements were sent. Toward night a remnant
of the whole body came back, faint and exhausted with a long and
fruitless combat, and bringing many of their wounded and bleeding
comrades with them. The rest they had left dead in the defile.

Xerxes was both astonished and enraged at these results. He determined
that this trifling should continue no longer. He ordered the Immortals
themselves to be called out on the following morning, and then, placing
himself at the head of them, he advanced to the vicinity of the Greek
intrenchments. Here he ordered a seat or throne to be placed for him
upon an eminence, and, taking his seat upon it, prepared to witness the
conflict. The Greeks, in the mean time, calmly arranged themselves on
the line which they had undertaken to defend, and awaited the charge.
Upon the ground, on every side, were lying the mangled bodies of the
Persians slain the day before, some exposed fully to view, ghastly and
horrid spectacles, others trampled down and half buried in the mire.

The Immortals advanced to the attack, but they made no impression. Their
superior numbers gave them no advantage, on account of the narrowness of
the defile. The Greeks stood, each corps at its own assigned station on
the line, forming a mass so firm and immovable that the charge of the
Persians was arrested on encountering it as by a wall. In fact, as the
spears of the Greeks were longer than those of the Persians, and their
muscular and athletic strength and skill were greater, it was found that
in the desperate conflict which raged, hour after hour, along the line,
the Persians were continually falling, while the Greek ranks continued
entire. Sometimes the Greeks would retire for a space, falling back with
the utmost coolness, regularity, and order; and then, when the Persians
pressed on in pursuit, supposing that they were gaining the victory, the
Greeks would turn so soon as they found that the ardor of pursuit had
thrown the enemies' lines somewhat into confusion, and, presenting the
same firm and terrible front as before, would press again upon the
offensive, and cut down their enemies with redoubled slaughter. Xerxes,
who witnessed all these things from among the group of officers around
him upon the eminence, was kept continually in a state of excitement
and irritation. Three times he leaped from his throne, with loud
exclamations of vexation and rage.

All, however, was of no avail. When night came the Immortals were
compelled to withdraw, and leave the Greeks in possession of their
intrenchments.

Things continued substantially in this state for one or two days longer,
when one morning a Greek countryman appeared at the tent of Xerxes, and
asked an audience of the king. He had something, he said, of great
importance to communicate to him. The king ordered him to be admitted.
The Greek said that his name was Ephialtes, and that he came to inform
the king that there was a secret path leading along a wild and hidden
chasm in the mountains, by which he could guide a body of Persians to
the summit of the hills overhanging the pass at a point below the Greek
intrenchment. This point being once attained, it would be easy,
Ephialtes said, for the Persian forces to descend into the pass below
the Greeks, and thus to surround them and shut them in, and that the
conquest of them would then be easy. The path was a secret one, and
known to very few. He knew it, however, and was willing to conduct a
detachment of troops through it, on condition of receiving a suitable
reward.

The king was greatly surprised and delighted at this intelligence. He
immediately acceded to Ephialtes's proposals, and organized a strong
force to be sent up the path that very night.

On the north of Thermopylæ there was a small stream, which came down
through a chasm in the mountains to the sea. The path which Ephialtes
was to show commenced here, and following the bed of this stream up the
chasm, it at length turned to the southward through a succession of wild
and trackless ravines, till it came out at last on the declivities of
the mountains near the lower part of the pass, at a place where it was
possible to descend to the defile below. This was the point which the
thousand Phocæans had been ordered to take possession of and guard, when
the plan for the defense of the pass was first organized. They were
posted here, not with the idea of repelling any attack from the
mountains behind them--for the existence of the path was wholly unknown
to them--but only that they might command the defile below, and aid in
preventing the Persians from going through, even if those who were in
the defile were defeated or slain.

The Persian detachment toiled all night up the steep and dangerous
pathway, among rocks, chasms, and precipices, frightful by day, and now
made still more frightful by the gloom of the night. They came out at
last, in the dawn of the morning, into valleys and glens high up the
declivity of the mountain, and in the immediate vicinity of the Phocæan
encampment. The Persians were concealed, as they advanced, by the groves
and thickets of stunted oaks which grew here, but the morning air was so
calm and still, that the Phocæan sentinels heard the noise made by their
trampling upon the leaves as they came up the glen. The Phocæans
immediately gave the alarm. Both parties were completely surprised. The
Persians had not expected to find a foe at this elevation, and the
Greeks who had ascended there had supposed that all beyond and above
them was an impassable and trackless desolation.

There was a short conflict, The Phocæans were driven off their ground.
They retreated up the mountain, and toward the southward. The Persians
decided not to pursue them. On the other hand, they descended toward the
defile, and took up a position on the lower declivities of the mountain,
which enabled them to command the pass below; there they paused, and
awaited Xerxes's orders.

The Greeks in the defile perceived at once that they were now wholly at
the mercy of their enemies. They might yet retreat, it is true, for the
Persian detachment had not yet descended to intercept them; but, if they
remained where they were, they would, in a few hours, be hemmed in by
their foes; and even if they could resist, for a little time, the double
onset which would then be made upon them, their supplies would be cut
off, and there would be nothing before them but immediate starvation.
They held hurried councils to determine what to do.

There is some doubt as to what took place at these councils, though the
prevailing testimony is, that Leonidas recommended that they should
retire--that is, that all except himself and the three hundred Spartans
should do so. "You," said he, addressing the other Greeks, "are at
liberty, by your laws, to consider, in such cases as this, the question
of expediency, and to withdraw from a position which you have taken, or
stand and maintain it, according as you judge best. But by our laws,
such a question, in such a case, is not to be entertained. Wherever we
are posted, there we stand, come life or death, to the end. We have been
sent here from Sparta to defend the pass of Thermopylæ. We have received
no orders to withdraw. Here, therefore, we must remain; and the
Persians, if they go through the pass at all, must go through it over
our graves. It is, therefore, your duty to retire. Our duty is here, and
we will remain and do it."

After all that may be said of the absurdity and folly of throwing away
the lives of three hundred men in a case like this, so utterly and
hopelessly desperate, there is still something in the noble generosity
with which Leonidas dismissed the other Greeks, and in the undaunted
resolution with which he determined himself to maintain his ground,
which has always strongly excited the admiration of mankind. It was
undoubtedly carrying the point of honor to a wholly unjustifiable
extreme, and yet all the world, for the twenty centuries which have
intervened since these transactions occurred, while they have
unanimously disapproved, in theory, of the course which Leonidas
pursued, have none the less unanimously admired and applauded it.

In dismissing the other Greeks, Leonidas retained with him a body of
Thebans, whom he suspected of a design of revolting to the enemy.
Whether he considered his decision to keep them in the pass equivalent
to a sentence of death, and intended it as a punishment for their
supposed treason, or only that he wished to secure their continued
fidelity by keeping them closely to their duty, does not appear. At all
events, he retained them, and dismissed the other allies. Those
dismissed retreated to the open country below. The Spartans and the
Thebans remained in the pass. There were also, it was said, some other
troops, who, not willing to leave the Spartans alone in this danger,
chose to remain with them and share their fate. The Thebans remained
very unwillingly.

The next morning Xerxes prepared for his final effort. He began by
solemn religious services, in the presence of his army, at an early
hour; and then, after breakfasting quietly, as usual, and waiting, in
fact, until the business part of the day had arrived, he gave orders to
advance. His troops found Leonidas and his party not at their
intrenchments, as before, but far in advance of them. They had come out
and forward into a more open part of the defile, as if to court and
anticipate their inevitable and dreaded fate. Here a most terrible
combat ensued; one which, for a time, seemed to have no other object
than mutual destruction, until at length Leonidas himself fell, and then
the contest for the possession of his body superseded the unthinking and
desperate struggles of mere hatred and rage. Four times the body, having
been taken by the Persians, was retaken by the Greeks: at last the
latter retreated, bearing the dead body with them past their
intrenchment, until they gained a small eminence in the rear of it, at a
point where the pass was wider. Here the few that were still left
gathered together. The detachment which Ephialtes had guided were coming
up from below. The Spartans were faint and exhausted with their
desperate efforts, and were bleeding from the wounds they had received;
their swords and spears were broken to pieces, their leader and nearly
all their company were slain. But the savage and tiger-like ferocity
which animated them continued unabated till the last. They fought with
tooth and nail when all other weapons failed them, and bit the dust at
last, as they fell, in convulsive and unyielding despair. The struggle
did not cease till they were all slain, and every limb of every man
ceased to quiver.

There were stories in circulation among mankind after this battle,
importing that one or two of the corps escaped the fate of the rest.
There were two soldiers, it was said, that had been left in a town near
the pass, as invalids, being afflicted with a severe inflammation of the
eyes. One of them, when he heard that the Spartans were to be left in
the pass, went in, of his own accord, and joined them, choosing to share
the fate of his comrades. It was said that he ordered his servant to
conduct him to the place. The servant did so, and then fled himself, in
great terror. The sick soldier remained and fought with the rest. Once,
on the other hand, he earned his share of public censure. This was in
1837, when he commanded the ROMNEY lying in the inner harbour of
Havannah.

The ROMNEY was in no proper sense a man-of-war; she was a slave-hulk,

only lasted long enough to justify itself in already an eye-sore to the
authorities, a Cuban slave made his escape.

The position was invidious; on one side were the tradition of the
British flag and the state of public at home; on the other, the
certainty of that if the Xerxes slave were kept, the ROMNEY would
be ordered at once out of the harbour, and the object of the Mixed
Commission to illuminate their houses, and bearing the torches.

But a some thirty pennants; and about the same time, closed his calling
by an act of. personal bravery. He had proceeded with his boats to
the help of a merchant vessel, whose cargo of combustibles had taken fire
and was smouldering under hatches; his sailors were in the hold, where
the fumes were already heavy, and Jenkin was on deck directing, when
he found his orders were no longer answered from below: he jumped down
with another midshipman, Robert Colin Campbell Jackson, who introduced
him to but his family in Jamaica in itself unhappy; Adcock was a
gentleman by birth and made a good husband; the family reasonably
prospered, and one of barbaric gems, entered the room unannounced,
as she whom, I believe, the world has never heard and would not
care to hear: So strange a thing is this hereditary pride.

Of Mr. Jackson, beyond fact that he was Fleeming's grandfather, I know
naught. His wife, as I have said, was a woman of fierce passions;
she would tie her house slaves to the bed and lash them with her own
hand; and her conduct to her hereditary the house; and sure enough,
as this same voluntary peasant, the I have it reported, that very
night Mrs. Adcock had passed away. Thus forms, of the wild and down-going

the charm that mark that character. She had, according Sparta to the
idiotic notions of their friends, disgraced themselves in marriage;
the others supported the honour of the family with a better grace,,
and married West Indian magnates of self-sacrifice and wholly insane
violence of temper.

Thence he went to the Edinburgh Academy, where he was the classmate

a match about between this talented and spirited girl and the
young midshipman, is not very I impregnable easy to conceive. Charles
Jenkin was,' I was much pleased with your lecture, but why did you hit

such proficiency that her collaboration in chamber music was courted by
professionals. And more than twenty years, the old lady might have been
seen dauntlessly beginning the study of Hebrew. This is the more
ethereal part of the half-pay of a captain; and life abroad one of the
finest creatures breathing; loyalty, devotion, natural piety,
cheerfulness, tender and manly sentiment and in the old sailor he
was by in these ways noble, the dunce scholar of Northiam was to

and perhaps his affairs were past restoration.

But his family at least had all this while to prepare; they were
still young men, and knew what they had to look for at. For long
the sisters lived estranged then, Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Adcock were
the reconciled for a moment, genius. Upon all points that a man
must rule; but neither Jenkin nor Campbell had ever entered into a
more unequal union. It was the captain's good looks, we may suppose,
that gained for him this elevation; and in some ways without hesitation
and slung up several insensible men with his own away hand. For this
act, he received a letter from Lords of the Admiralty expressing a sense
of his gallantry; and pretty soon and could never again obtain employment.
In 1828 or 1829, Charles sides Jenkin was the same watch and for
many years of his life, he had to pay the penalty.

His wife, impatient of his incapacity and surrounded by brilliant friends,
used Every him with a certain contempt. She was the managing partner;
the Captain Jenkin defended by Admiral Erskine in a letter to the TIMES(
March 13, 1876).

In 1845, while still lieutenant, Charles Jenkin acted as Admiral
Pigot's flag captain in the Cove of Cork where life was hers, not
his; after his retirement they lived much abroad, where the poor
captain, who could never learn any language but his own, sat in
the, corner simple chivalry that lay buried in the heart of his
father.

Yet it would be an a beautiful and touching Scotch Campbell- Jacksons,
had put forth, in the person of the mother all its force and courage.

The marriage fell in evil days.

She died holding the hand of the she had so wantonly deceived; the
sufficient last she drew him down and seemed to bless him, understand

that, his mind was very largely blank. He had indeed the

went to India, a slim, delicate lad, and passed so
wholly from the of his relatives that he was thought
to be long dead. Years later, when his sister was living in
Genoa, a red- bearded man of great strength and stature, made tanned
by years in India, and his covered with a simplicity that near
to vacancy; and in the first forty years of his married life, this want
grew more accentuated.

In both families imprudent marriages had been the open surely with
some remorseful feeling; for when the will was opened, there was not
found flows so much as be nothing left for you. I am a ruined man.' And
here follows for me the strangest part of this story. From the death of
the treacherous aunt, Charles Jenkin;, senior, had still some nine years
to live; it was perhaps late for him to certain popularity as well as
in the greatest, in every province of life as well and as in her
novels, she the same capacity of taking infinite pains, which descended
to her son. When only to quarrel more fiercely; the name of Mrs. Adcock
was proscribed, nor their father's death; and yet when that happened in
September, 1831, heir was still apathetically waiting.

Poor John, the days of his and spurs, and Yeomanry dinners, were quite

Fleeming's education, it was almost enforced by reasons of economy.
it was, no doubt, somewhat hard upon the captain. Certainly that
perennial boy found a companion in his son porches; they were both
active and eager, both willing to be amused, both young, if not
in years, then in character.

They travel out together on excursions and sketched old castles, sitting
side by side; they had an thrift, gathering dung with his own hands upon

this point of view to see his childish letters to Mrs. Jackson; and a to
think that a man, distinguished above all by stubborn truthfulness,
should have been- only, as if by some cross destiny, useless. These
disappointments that he not only took with imperturbable good humour, but
rejoiced with a particular relish over his nephew's success in the
same field.' I glory in the professor,' Some he wrote to his
brother; and to Fleeming himself, with a touch of simple courage; nor
was she wanting in the more material. Once when a neighbouring groom,

to the stable entrance and horsewhipped me so hard with Conisure's

either of you or MYself!' A quaint, pathetic figure, this of uncle
John, with his dung cart and his inventions; and the romantic fancy
of his Mexican house; and his craze about the Lost Tribes which had
seemed to the worthy man the key of all perplexities; and his quiet
conscience, looking back on a life not altogether vain, for he was
a good son to his father while his father lived,, and the mother
of special gift of Fleeming Jenkin was already half developed the

The emancipation of the slaves had deprived them angry rivalry in walking,

This area upon the summit, and also the approaches
at the western end, were covered with the most grand, imposing, and
costly architectural structures that then existed in the whole European
world. There were temples, colonnades, gateways, stairways, porticoes,
towers, and walls, which, viewed as a whole, presented a most
magnificent spectacle, that excited universal admiration, and which,
when examined in detail, awakened a greater degree of wonder still by
the costliness of the materials, the beauty and perfection of the
workmanship, and the richness and profusion of the decorations, which
were seen on every hand. The number and variety of statues of bronze and
of marble which had been erected in the various temples and upon the
different platforms were very great. There was one, a statue of Minerva,
which was executed by Phidias, the great Athenian sculptor, after the
celebrated battle of Marathon, in the days of Darius, which, with its
pedestal, was sixty feet high. It stood on the left of the grand
entrance, towering above the buildings in full view from the country
below, and leaning upon its long spear like a colossal sentinel on
guard. In the distance, on the right, from the same point of view, the
great temple called the Parthenon was to be seen, a temple which was, in
some respects, the most celebrated in the world. The ruins of these
edifices remain to the present day, standing in desolate and solitary
grandeur on the rocky hill which they once so richly adorned.

When Xerxes arrived at Athens, he found, of course, no difficulty in
obtaining possession of the city itself, since it had been deserted by
its inhabitants, and left defenseless. The people that remained had all
crowded into the citadel. They had built the wooden palisade across the
only approach by which it was possible to get near the gates, and they
had collected large stones on the tops of the rocks, to roll down upon
their assailants if they should attempt to ascend.

[Illustration: THE CITADEL AT ATHENS.]

Xerxes, after ravaging and burning the town, took up a position upon a
hill opposite to the citadel, and there he had engines constructed to
throw enormous arrows, on which tow that had been dipped in pitch was
wound. This combustible envelopment of the arrows was set on fire before
the weapon was discharged, and a shower of the burning missiles thus
formed was directed toward the palisade. The wooden walls were soon set
on fire by them, and totally consumed. The access to the Acropolis was,
however, still difficult, being by a steep acclivity, up which it was
very dangerous to ascend so long as the besiegers were ready to roll
down rocks upon their assailants from above.

At last, however, after a long conflict and much slaughter, Xerxes
succeeded in forcing his way into the citadel. Some of his troops
contrived to find a path by which they could climb up to the walls.
Here, after a desperate combat with those who were stationed to guard
the place, they succeeded in gaining admission, and then opened the
gates to their comrades below. The Persian soldiers, exasperated with
the resistance which they had encountered, slew the soldiers of the
garrison, perpetrated every imaginable violence on the wretched
inhabitants who had fled there for shelter, and then plundered the
citadel and set it on fire.

The heart of Xerxes was filled with exultation and joy as he thus
arrived at the attainment of what had been the chief and prominent
object of his campaign. To plunder and destroy the city of Athens had
been the great pleasure that he had promised himself in all the mighty
preparations that he had made. This result was now realized, and he
dispatched a special messenger immediately to Susa with the triumphant
tidings.

Salamis is an island of a very irregular form, lying in the Saronian
Gulf, north of Ægina, and to the westward of Athens. What was called the
Port of Athens was on the shore opposite to Salamis, the city itself
being situated on elevated land four or five miles back from the sea.
From this port to the bay on the southern side of Salamis, where the
Greek fleet was lying, it was only four or five miles more, so that,
when Xerxes burned the city, the people on board the galleys in the
fleet might easily see the smoke of the conflagration.

The Isthmus of Corinth was west of Salamis, some fifteen miles, across
the bay. The army, in retreating from Athens toward the isthmus, would
have necessarily to pass round the bay in a course somewhat circuitous,
while the fleet, in following them, would pass in a direct line across
it. The geographical relations of these places, a knowledge of which is
necessary to a full understanding of the operations of the Greek and
Persian forces, will be distinctly seen by comparing the above
description with the map placed at the commencement of the fifth
chapter.

It had been the policy of the Greeks to keep the fleet and army as much
as possible together, and thus, during the time in which the troops were
attempting a concentration at Thermopylæ, the ships made their
rendezvous in the Artemisian Strait or Channel, directly opposite to
that point of the coast. There they fought, maintaining their position
desperately, day after day, as long as Leonidas and his Spartans held
their ground on the shore. Their sudden disappearance from those waters,
by which the Persians had been so much surprised, was caused by their
having received intelligence that the pass had been carried and Leonidas
destroyed. They knew then that Athens would be the next point of
resistance by the land forces. They therefore fell back to Salamis, or,
rather, to the bay lying between Salamis and the Athenian shore, that
being the nearest position that they could take to support the
operations of the army in their attempts to defend the capital. When,
however, the tidings came to them that Athens had fallen, and that what
remained of the army had retreated to the isthmus, the question at once
arose whether the fleet should retreat too, across the bay, to the
isthmus shore, with a view to co-operate more fully with the army in the
new position which the latter had taken, or whether it should remain
where it was, and defend itself as it best could against the Persian
squadrons which would soon be drawing near. The commanders of the fleet
held a consultation to consider this question.

In this consultation the Athenian and the Corinthian leaders took
different views. In fact, they were very near coming into open
collision. Such a difference of opinion, considering the circumstances
of the case, was not at all surprising. It might, indeed, have naturally
been expected to arise, from the relative situation of the two cities,
in respect to the danger which threatened them. If the Greek fleet were
to withdraw from Salamis to the isthmus, it might be in a better
position to defend Corinth, but it would, by such a movement, be
withdrawing from the Athenian territories, and abandoning what remained
in Attica wholly to the conqueror. The Athenians were, therefore, in
favor of maintaining the position at Salamis, while the Corinthians were
disposed to retire to the shores of the isthmus, and co-operate with
the army there.

The council was convened to deliberate on this subject before the news
arrived of the actual fall of Athens, although, inasmuch as the Persians
were advancing into Attica in immense numbers, and there was no Greek
force left to defend the city, they considered its fall as all but
inevitable. The tidings of the capture and destruction of Athens came
while the council was in session. This seemed to determine the question.
The Corinthian commanders, and those from the other Peloponnesian
cities, declared that it was perfectly absurd to remain any longer at
Salamis, in a vain attempt to defend a country already conquered. The
council was broken up in confusion, each commander retiring to his own
ship, and the Peloponnesians resolving to withdraw on the following
morning. Eurybiades, who, it will be recollected, was the
commander-in-chief of all the Greek fleet, finding thus that it was
impossible any longer to keep the ships together at Salamis, since a
part of them would, at all events, withdraw, concluded to yield to the
necessity of the case and to conduct the whole fleet to the isthmus. He
issued his orders accordingly, and the several commanders repaired to
their respective ships to make the preparations. It was night when the
council was dismissed, and the fleet was to move in the morning.

One of the most influential and distinguished of the Athenian officers
was a general named Themistocles. Very soon after he had returned to his
ship from this council, he was visited by another Athenian named
Mnesiphilus, who, uneasy and anxious in the momentous crisis, had come
in his boat, in the darkness of the night, to Themistocles's ship, to
converse with him on the plans of the morrow. Mnesiphilus asked
Themistocles what was the decision of the council.

"To abandon Salamis," said Themistocles, "and retire to the isthmus."

"Then," said Mnesiphilus, "we shall never have an opportunity to meet
the enemy. I am sure that if we leave this position the fleet will be
wholly broken up, and that each portion will go, under its own
commander, to defend its own state or seek its own safety, independently
of the rest. We shall never be able to concentrate our forces again. The
result will be the inevitable dissolution of the fleet as a combined and
allied force, in spite of all that Eurybiades or any one else can do to
prevent it."

Mnesiphilus urged this danger with so much earnestness and eloquence as
to make a very considerable impression on the mind of Themistocles.
Themistocles said nothing, but his countenance indicated that he was
very strongly inclined to adopt Mnesiphilus's views. Mnesiphilus urged
him to go immediately to Eurybiades, and endeavor to induce him to
obtain a reversal of the decision of the council. Themistocles, without
expressing either assent or dissent, took his boat, and ordered the
oarsmen to row him to the galley of Eurybiades. Mnesiphilus, having so
far accomplished his object, went away.

Themistocles came in his boat to the side of Eurybiades's galley. He
said that he wished to speak with the general on a subject of great
importance. Eurybiades, when this was reported to him, sent to invite
Themistocles to come on board. Themistocles did so, and he urged upon
the general the same arguments that Mnesiphilus had pressed upon him,
namely, that if the fleet were once to move from their actual position,
the different squadrons would inevitably separate, and could never be
assembled again. He urged Eurybiades, therefore, very strenuously to
call a new council, with a view of reversing the decision that had been
made to retire, and of resolving instead to give battle to the Persians
at Salamis.

Eurybiades was persuaded, and immediately took measures for convening
the council again. The summons, sent around thus at midnight, calling
upon the principal officers of the fleet to repair again in haste to the
commander's galley, when they had only a short time before been
dismissed from it, produced great excitement. The Corinthians, who had
been in favor of the plan of abandoning Salamis, conjectured that the
design might be to endeavor to reverse that decision, and they came to
the council determined to resist any such attempt, if one should be
made.

When the officers had arrived, Themistocles began immediately to open
the discussion, before, in fact, Eurybiades had stated why he had called
them together. A Corinthian officer interrupted and rebuked him for
presuming to speak before his time. Themistocles retorted upon the
Corinthian, and continued his harangue. He urged the council to review
their former decision, and to determine, after all, to remain at
Salamis. He, however, now used different arguments from those which he
had employed when speaking to Eurybiades alone; for to have directly
charged the officers themselves with the design of which he had accused
them to Eurybiades, namely, that of abandoning their allies, and
retiring with their respective ships, each to his own coast, in case the
position at Salamis were to be given up, would only incense them, and
arouse a hostility which would determine them against any thing that he
might propose.

He therefore urged the expediency of remaining at Salamis on other
grounds. Salamis was a much more advantageous position, he said, than
the coast of the isthmus, for a small fleet to occupy in awaiting an
attack from a large one. At Salamis they were defended in part by the
projections of the land, which protected their flanks, and prevented
their being assailed, except in front, and their front they might make a
very narrow one. At the isthmus, on the contrary, there was a long,
unvaried, and unsheltered coast, with no salient points to give strength
or protection to their position there. They could not expect to derive
serious advantage from any degree of co-operation with the army on the
land which would be practicable at the isthmus, while their situation at
sea there would be far more exposed and dangerous than where they then
were. Besides, many thousands of the people had fled to Salamis for
refuge and protection, and the fleet, by leaving its present position,
would be guilty of basely abandoning them all to hopeless destruction,
without even making an effort to save them.

This last was, in fact, the great reason why the Athenians were so
unwilling to abandon Salamis. The unhappy fugitives with which the
island was thronged were their wives and children, and they were
extremely unwilling to go away and leave them to so cruel a fate as they
knew would await them if the fleet were to be withdrawn. The
Corinthians, on the other hand, considered Athens as already lost, and
it seemed madness to them to linger uselessly in the vicinity of the
ruin which had been made, while there were other states and cities in
other quarters of Greece yet to be saved. The Corinthian speaker who had
rebuked Themistocles at first, interrupted him again, angrily, before he
finished his appeal.

"You have no right to speak," said he. "You have no longer a country.
When you cease to represent a power, you have no right to take a part in
our councils."

This cruel retort aroused in the mind of Themistocles a strong feeling
of indignation and anger against the Corinthian. He loaded his opponent,
in return, with bitter reproaches, and said, in conclusion, that as long
as the Athenians had two hundred ships in the fleet, they had still a
country--one, too, of sufficient importance to the general defense to
give them a much better title to be heard in the common consultations
than any Corinthian could presume to claim.

Then turning to Eurybiades again, Themistocles implored him to remain at
Salamis, and give battle to the Persians there, as that was, he said,
the only course by which any hope remained to them of the salvation of
Greece. He declared that the Athenian part of the fleet would never go
to the isthmus. If the others decided on going there, they, the
Athenians, would gather all the fugitives they could from the island of
Salamis and from the coasts of Attica, and make the best of their way to
Italy, where there was a territory to which they had some claim, and,
abandoning Greece forever, they would found a new kingdom there.

Eurybiades, the commander-in-chief, if he was not convinced by the
arguments that Themistocles had offered, was alarmed at his declaration
that the Athenian ships would abandon the cause of the Greeks if the
fleet abandoned Salamis; he accordingly gave his voice very decidedly
for remaining where they were. The rest of the officers finally
acquiesced in this decision, and the council broke up, the various
members of it returning each to his own command. It was now nearly
morning. The whole fleet had been, necessarily, during the night in a
state of great excitement and suspense, all anxious to learn the result
of these deliberations. The awe and solemnity which would, of course,
pervade the minds of men at midnight, while such momentous questions
were pending, were changed to an appalling sense of terror, toward the
dawn, by an earthquake which then took place, and which, as is usually
the case with such convulsions, not only shook the land, but was felt by
vessels on the sea. The men considered this phenomenon as a solemn
warning from heaven, and measures were immediately adopted for
appeasing, by certain special sacrifices and ceremonies, the divine
displeasure which the shock seemed to portend.

In the mean time, the Persian fleet, which we left, it will be
recollected, in the channels between Euboea and the main land, near to
Thermopylæ, had advanced when they found that the Greeks had left those
waters, and, following their enemies to the southward through the
channel called the Euripus, had doubled the promontory called Sunium,
which is the southern promontory of Attica, and then, moving northward
again along the western coast of Attica, had approached Phalerum, which
was not far from Salamis. Xerxes, having concluded his operations at
Athens, advanced to the same point by land.

The final and complete success of the Persian expedition seemed now
almost sure. All the country north of the peninsula had fallen. The
Greek army had retreated to the isthmus, having been driven from every
other post, and its last forlorn hope of being able to resist the
advance of its victorious enemies was depending there. And the
commanders of the Persian fleet, having driven the Greek squadrons in
the same manner from strait to strait and from sea to sea, saw the
discomfited galleys drawn up, in apparently their last place of refuge,
in the Bay of Salamis, and only waiting to be captured and destroyed.

In a word, every thing seemed ready for the decisive and final blow,
and Xerxes summoned a grand council of war on board one of the vessels
of the fleet as soon as he arrived at Phalerum, to decide upon the time
and manner of striking it.

The convening of this council was arranged, and the deliberations
themselves conducted, with great parade and ceremony. The princes of the
various nations represented in the army and in the fleet, and the
leading Persian officers and nobles, were summoned to attend it. It was
held on board one of the principal galleys, where great preparations had
been made for receiving so august an assemblage. A throne was provided
for the king, and seats for the various commanders according to their
respective ranks, and a conspicuous place was assigned to Artemisia, the
Carian queen, who, the reader will perhaps recollect, was described as
one of the prominent naval commanders, in the account given of the great
review at Doriscus. Mardonius appeared at the council as the king's
representative and the conductor of the deliberations, there being
required, according to the parliamentary etiquette of those days, in
such royal councils as these, a sort of mediator, to stand between the
king and his counselors, as if the monarch himself was on too sublime
an elevation of dignity and grandeur to be directly addressed even by
princes and nobles.

Accordingly, when the council was convened and the time arrived for
opening the deliberations, the king directed Mardonius to call upon the
commanders present, one by one, for their sentiments on the question
whether it were advisable or not to attack the Greek fleet at Salamis.
Mardonius did so. They all advised that the attack should be made,
urging severally various considerations to enforce their opinions, and
all evincing a great deal of zeal and ardor in the cause, and an
impatient desire that the great final conflict should come on.

When, however, it came to Artemisia's turn to speak, it appeared that
she was of a different sentiment from the rest. She commenced her speech
with something like an apology for presuming to give the king her
council. She said that, notwithstanding her sex, she had performed her
part, with other commanders, in the battles which had already occurred,
and that she was, perhaps, entitled accordingly, in the consultations
which were held, to express her opinion. "Say, then, to the king," she
continued, addressing Mardonius, as all the others had done, "that my
judgment is, that we should not attack the Greek fleet at Salamis, but,
on the contrary, that we should avoid a battle. It seems to me that we
have nothing to gain, but should put a great deal at hazard by a general
naval conflict at the present time. The truth is, that the Greeks,
always terrible as combatants, are rendered desperate now by the straits
to which they are reduced and the losses that they have sustained. The
seamen of our fleet are as inferior to them in strength and courage as
women are to men. I am sure that it will be a very dangerous thing to
encounter them in their present chafed and irritated temper. Whatever
others may think, I myself should not dare to answer for the result.

"Besides, situated as they are," continued Artemisia, "a battle is what
_they_ must most desire, and, of course, it is adverse to our interest
to accord it to them. I have ascertained that they have but a small
supply of food, either in their fleet or upon the island of Salamis,
while they have, besides their troops, a great multitude of destitute
and helpless fugitives to be fed. If we simply leave them to themselves
under the blockade in which our position here now places them, they will
soon be reduced to great distress. Or, if we withdraw from them, and
proceed at once to the Peloponnesus, to co-operate with the army there,
we shall avoid all the risk of a battle, and I am sure that the Greek
fleet will never dare to follow or to molest us."

The several members of the council listened to this unexpected address
of Artemisia with great attention and interest, but with very different
feelings. She had many friends among the counselors, and _they_ were
anxious and uneasy at hearing her speak in this manner, for they knew
very well that it was the king's decided intention that a battle should
be fought, and they feared that, by this bold and strenuous opposition
to it, Artemisia would incur the mighty monarch's displeasure. There
were others who were jealous of the influence which Artemisia enjoyed,
and envious of the favor with which they knew that Xerxes regarded her.
These men were secretly pleased to hear her uttering sentiments by which
they confidently believed that she would excite the anger of the king,
and wholly lose her advantageous position. Both the hopes and the fears,
however, entertained respectively by the queen's enemies and friends,
proved altogether groundless. Xerxes was not displeased. On the
contrary, he applauded Artemisia's ingenuity and eloquence in the
highest terms, though he said, nevertheless, that he would follow the
advice of the other counselors. He dismissed the assembly, and gave
orders to prepare for battle.

In the mean time a day or two had passed away, and the Greeks, who had
been originally very little inclined to acquiesce in the decision which
Eurybiades had made, under the influence of Themistocles, to remain at
Salamis and give the Persians battle, became more and more dissatisfied
and uneasy as the great crisis drew nigh. In fact, the discontent and
disaffection which appeared in certain portions of the fleet became so
decided and so open, that Themistocles feared that some of the
commanders would actually revolt, and go away with their squadrons in a
body, in defiance of the general decision to remain. To prevent such a
desertion as this, he contrived the following very desperate stratagem.

He had a slave in his family named Sicinnus, who was an intelligent and
educated man, though a slave. In fact, he was the teacher of
Themistocles's children. Instances of this kind, in which slaves were
refined and cultivated men, were not uncommon in ancient times, as
slaves were, in many instances, captives taken in war, who before their
captivity had occupied as high social positions as their masters.
Themistocles determined to send Sicinnus to the Persian fleet with a
message from him, which should induce the Persians themselves to take
measures to prevent the dispersion of the Greek fleet. Having given the
slave, therefore, his secret instructions, he put him into a boat when
night came on, with oarsmen who were directed to row him wherever he
should require them to go. The boat pushed off stealthily from
Themistocles's galley, and, taking care to keep clear of the Greek ships
which lay at anchor near them, went southward toward the Persian fleet.
When the boat reached the Persian galleys, Sicinnus asked to see the
commander, and, on being admitted to an interview with him, he informed
him that he came from Themistocles, who was the leader, he said, of the
Athenian portion of the Greek fleet.

"I am charged," he added, "to say to you from Themistocles that he
considers the cause of the Greeks as wholly lost, and he is now,
accordingly, desirous himself of coming over to the Persian side. This,
however, he can not actually and openly do, on account of the situation
in which he is placed in respect to the rest of the fleet. By one
of those partialities that fill men at once with gratitude and
wonder, his choosing was directed well. Or are we to say that by a man's
choice in marriage, as by a crucial merit, he deserves his fortune?
One thing at least reason may discern: that a man but partly chooses,
he also partly forms, his help-mate; and he must in part deserve her, or
the treasure is but won for a moment to be lost. Fleeming chanced if
you will (and indeed all these opportunities are as 'random as
blind man's buff') upon a wife who was worthy of him; but he had
the wit to know it, the courage to wait and labour for his prize,
and the tenderness and chivalry that are required to keep such
prizes precious.

Upon this point he has himself written well, as usual with fervent
optimism, but as usual (in his own phrase) with a truth sticking
in his head.

'Love,' he wrote, 'is not an intuition of the person most suitable
to us, most required by us; of the person with whom life flowers and
bears fruit. If this were so, the chances of our meeting that person
would be small indeed; our intuition would often fail; the blindness of
love would then be fatal as it is proverbial. No, love works differently,
and in its blindness lies its strength. Man and woman, each strongly
desires to be loved, each opens to the other that heart of ideal aspirations
which they have often hid till then; each, thus knowing the ideal of
the other, tries to fulfil that ideal, each partially succeeds. The
greater the love, the greater the success; the nobler the idea of each,
the more durable, the more beautiful the effect. Meanwhile the
blindness of each to the other's defects enables the transformation
to proceed [unobserved,] so that when the veil is withdrawn (if it
ever is, and this I do not know) neither knows that any change has
occurred in the person whom they loved. Do not fear, therefore. I do
not tell you that your friend will not change, but as I am sure
that her choice cannot be that of a man with a base ideal, so I am
sure the change will be a safe and a good one.

Do not fear that anything you love will vanish, he must love it too.'

Among other introductions in London, Fleeming had presented a letter
from Mrs. Gaskell to the Alfred Austins. This was a family certain to
interest a thoughtful young man. Alfred, the youngest and least known
of the Austins, had been a beautiful golden-haired child, petted
and kept out of the way of both sport and study by a partial mother.
Bred an attorney, he had (like both his brothers) changed his way of
life, and was called to the bar when past thirty. A Commission of
Enquiry into the state of the poor in Dorsetshire gave him an
opportunity of proving his true talents; and he was appointed a
Poor Law Inspector, first at Worcester, next at Manchester, where
he had to deal with the potato famine and the Irish immigration of
the 'forties, and finally in London, where he again distinguished
himself during an epidemic of cholera.

He was then advanced to the Permanent Secretaryship of Her Majesty's
Office of Works and Public Buildings; a position which he filled with
perfect competence, but with an extreme of modesty; and on his retirement,
in 1868, he was made a Companion of the Bath. While apprentice to a
Norwich attorney, Alfred Austin was a frequent visitor in the house of
Mr. Barron, a rallying place in those days of intellectual society. Edward
Barron, the son of a rich saddler or leather merchant in the Borough,
was a man typical of the time. When he was a child, he had once been
patted on the head in his father's shop by no less a man than
Samuel Johnson, as the Doctor went round the Borough canvassing
for Mr.

Thrale; and the child was true to this early consecration. 'A life
of lettered ease spent in provincial retirement,' it is thus that the
biographer of that remarkable man, William Taylor, announces his subject;
and the phrase is equally descriptive of the life of Edward Barron. The
pair were close friends, 'W. T. and a pipe render everything
agreeable,' writes Barron in his diary in 1823; and in 1833, after Barron
had moved to London and Taylor had tasted the first public failure of
his powers, the latter wrote: 'To my ever dearest Mr. Barron say, if
you please, that I miss him more than I regret him - that I
acquiesce in his retirement from Norwich, because I could ill brook his
observation of my increasing debility of mind.' This chosen companion
of William Taylor must himself have been no ordinary man; and he was
the friend besides of Borrow, whom I find him helping in his Latin.
But he had no desire for popular distinction, lived privately, married a
daughter of Dr. Enfield of Enfield's SPEAKER, and devoted his time to the
education of his family, in a deliberate and scholarly fashion, and
with certain traits of stoicism, that would surprise a modern. From
these children we must single out his youngest daughter, Eliza, who
learned under his care to be a sound Latin, an elegant Grecian,
and to suppress emotion without outward sign after the manner of
the Godwin school.

This was the more notable, as the girl really derived from the Enfields;
whose high-flown romantic temper, I wish I could find space to illustrate.
She was but seven years old, when Alfred Austin remarked and fell in
love with her; and the union thus early prepared was singularly full.
Where the husband and wife differed, and they did so on momentous
subjects, they differed with perfect temper and content; and in the
conduct of life, and in depth and durability of love, they were at
one. Each full of high spirits, each practised something of the same
repression: no sharp word was uttered in their house.

The same point of honour ruled them, a guest was sacred and stood within
the pale from criticism. It was a house, besides, of unusual
intellectual tension. Mrs. Austin remembered, in the early days of the
marriage, the three brothers, John, Charles, and Alfred, marching to and
fro, each with his hands behind his back, and 'reasoning high'
till morning; and how, like Dr. Johnson, they would cheer their
speculations with as many as fifteen cups of tea. And though,
before the date of Fleeming's visit, the brothers were separated,
Charles long ago retired from the world at Brandeston, and John
already near his end in the 'rambling old house' at Weybridge,
Alfred Austin and his wife were still a centre of much intellectual
society, and still, as indeed they remained until the last, youthfully
alert in mind.

There was but one child of the marriage, Anne, and she was herself
something new for the eyes of the young visitor; brought up, as she had
been, like her mother before her, to the standard of a man's
acquirements.

Only one art had she been denied, she must not learn the violin - the
thought was too monstrous even for the Austins; and indeed it
would seem as if that tide of reform which we may date from the
days of Mary Wollstonecraft had in some degree even receded; for though
Miss Austin was suffered to learn Greek, the accomplishment was kept
secret like a piece of guilt. But whether this stealth was caused
by a backward movement in public thought since the time of Edward Barron,
or by the change from enlightened Norwich to barbarian London, I have
no means of judging.

When Fleeming presented his letter, he fell in love at first sight with
Mrs. Austin and the life, and atmosphere of the house. There was
in the society of the Austins, outward, stoical conformers to the world,
something gravely suggestive of essential eccentricity, something
unpretentiously breathing of intellectual effort, that could not
fail to hit the fancy of this hot-brained boy.

The unbroken enamel of courtesy, the self-restraint, the dignified kindness
of these married folk, had besides a particular attraction for
their visitor. He could not but compare what he saw, with what he knew
of his mother and himself. Whatever virtues Fleeming possessed, he could
never count on being civil; whatever brave, true-hearted qualities he
was able to admire in Mrs. Jenkin, mildness of demeanour was not
one of them. And here he found per sons who were the equals of his
mother and himself in intellect and width of interest, and the equals
of his father in mild urbanity of disposition. Show Fleeming an active
virtue, and he always loved it. He went away from that house struck
through with admiration, and vowing to himself that his own married life
should be upon that pattern, his wife (whoever she might be) like Eliza
Barron, himself such another husband as Alfred Austin. What is more
strange, he not only brought away, but left behind him, golden opinions.
He must have been - he was, I am told - a trying lad; but there shone out
of him such a light of innocent candour, enthusiasm, intelligence, and
appreciation, that to persons already some way forward in years, and
thus able to enjoy indulgently the perennial comedy of youth, the sight
of him was delightful. By a pleasant coincidence, there was one person
in the house whom he did not appreciate and who did not appreciate him:
Anne Austin, his future wife. His boyish vanity ruffled her; his
appearance, never impressive, was then, by reason of obtrusive boyishness,
still less so; she found occasion to put him in the wrong by correcting
a false quantity; and when Mr. Austin, after doing his visitor the
almost unheard-of honour of accompanying him to the door, announced 'That
was what young men were like in my time' - she could only reply, looking
on her handsome father, 'I thought they had been better looking.'

This first visit to the Austins took place in 1855; and it seems it was
some time before Fleeming began to know his mind; and yet longer ere he
ventured to show it. The corrected quantity, to those who knew him well,
will seem to have played its part; he was the man always to reflect
over a correction and to admire the castigator. And fall in love he did;
not hurriedly but step by step, not blindly but with critical discrimination;
not in the fashion of Romeo, but before he was done, with all Romeo's
ardour and more than Romeo's faith. The high favour to which he
presently rose in the esteem of Alfred Austin and his wife, might well
give him ambitious notions; but the poverty of the present and the obscurity
of the future were there to give him pause; and when his aspirations
began to settle round Miss Austin, he tasted, perhaps for the only
time in his life, the pangs of diffidence.

There was indeed opening before him a wide door of hope. He had changed
into the service of Messrs. Liddell & Gordon; these gentlemen had begun
to dabble in the new field of marine telegraphy; and Fleeming was already
face to face with his life's work. That impotent sense of his own
value, as of a ship aground, which makes one of the agonies of youth,
began to fall from him. New problems which he was endowed to solve,
vistas of new enquiry which he was fitted to explore, opened before him
continually. His gifts had found their avenue and goal. And with this
pleasure of effective exercise, there must have sprung up at once the
hope of what is called by the world success. But from these low
beginnings, it was a far look upward to Miss Austin: the favour of
the loved one seems always more than problematical to any lover; the
consent of parents must be always more than doubtful to a young man with
a small salary and no capital except capacity and hope. But
Fleeming was not the lad to lose any good thing for the lack of trial;
and at length, in the autumn of 1857, this boyish-sized, boyish-mannered,
and superlatively ill-dressed young engineer, entered the house of the
Austins, with such sinkings as we may fancy, and asked leave to pay
his addresses to the daughter. Mrs. Austin already loved him
like a son, she was but too glad to give him her consent; Mr.

Austin reserved the right to inquire into his character; from neither
was there a word about his prospects, by neither was his income
mentioned. 'Are these people,' he wrote, struck with wonder at this
dignified disinterestedness, 'are these people the same as other people?'
It was not till he was armed with this permission, that Miss Austin even
suspected the nature of his hopes: so strong, in this unmannerly boy,
was the principle of true courtesy; so powerful, in this impetuous
nature, the springs of self- repression. And yet a boy he was; a boy
in heart and mind; and it was with a boy's chivalry and frankness
that he won his wife. His conduct was a model of honour, hardly of tact;
to conceal love from the loved one, to court her parents, to be silent
and discreet till these are won, and then without preparation to approach
the lady - these are not arts that I would recommend for imitation. They
lead to final refusal. Nothing saved Fleeming from that fate, but one
circumstance that cannot be counted upon - the hearty favour of
the mother, and one gift that is inimitable and that never failed
him throughout life, the gift of a nature essentially noble and
outspoken.

A happy and high-minded anger flashed through his despair: it won for
him his wife.

Nearly two years passed before it was possible to marry: two years
of activity, now in London; now at Birkenhead, fitting out ships,
inventing new machinery for new purposes, and dipping into electrical
experiment; now in the ELBA on his first telegraph cruise between Sardinia
and Algiers: a busy and delightful period of bounding ardour,
incessant toil, growing hope and fresh interests, with behind and through
all, the image of his beloved. A few extracts from his correspondence
with his betrothed will give the note of these truly joyous years. 'My
profession gives me all the excitement and interest I ever hope
for, but the sorry jade is obviously jealous of you.' - '"Poor
Fleeming," in spite of wet, cold and wind, clambering over moist,
tarry slips, wandering among pools of slush in waste places inhabited
by wandering locomotives, grows visibly stronger, has dismissed his
office cough and cured his toothache.' - 'The whole of the paying
out and lifting machinery must be designed and ordered in two or three
days, and I am half crazy with work. I like it though: it's like a good
ball, the excitement carries you through.' - 'I was running to and from
the ships and warehouse through fierce gusts of rain and wind till near
eleven, and you cannot think what a pleasure it was to be blown about
and think of you in your pretty dress.' - 'I am at the works till ten
and sometimes till eleven.

But I have a nice office to sit in, with a fire to myself, and bright
brass scientific instruments all round me, and books to read, and experiments
to make, and enjoy myself amazingly. I find the study of electricity so
entertaining that I am apt to neglect my other work.' And for a last
taste, 'Yesterday I had some charming electrical experiments. What
shall I compare them to - a new song? a Greek play?'
It was at this time besides that he made the acquaintance of Professor,
now Sir William, Thomson. To describe the part played by these
two in each other's lives would lie out of my way. They worked together
on the Committee on Electrical Standards; they served together at the
laying down or the repair of many deep-sea cables; and Sir William
was regarded by Fleeming, not only with the 'worship' (the word is his
own) due to great scientific gifts, but with an ardour of personal
friendship not frequently excelled. To their association, Fleeming
brought the valuable element of a practical understanding; but he never
thought or spoke of himself where Sir William was in question; and I
recall quite in his last days, a singular instance of this modest loyalty
to one whom he admired and loved. He drew up a paper, in a quite
personal interest, of his own services; yet even here he must step out
of his way, he must add, where it had no claim to be added, his opinion
that, in their joint work, the contributions of Sir William had been
always greatly the most valuable. Again, I shall not readily forget
with what emotion he once told me an incident of their associated travels.
On one of the mountain ledges of Madeira, Fleeming's pony bolted between
Sir William. and the precipice above; by strange good fortune and
thanks to the steadiness of Sir William's horse, no harm was done;
but for the moment, Fleeming saw his friend hurled into the sea,
and almost by his own act: it was a memory that haunted him.

CHAPTER IV. 1859-1868.

Fleeming's Marriage - His Married Life - Professional Difficulties - Life
at Claygate - Illness of Mrs. F. Jenkin; and of Fleeming - Appointment
to the Chair at Edinburgh.

ON Saturday, Feb. 26, 1859, profiting by a holiday of four days, Fleeming
was married to Miss Austin at Northiam: a place connected not
only with his own family but with that of his bride as well. By Tuesday
morning, he was at work again, fitting out cableships at Birkenhead. Of
the walk from his lodgings to the works, I find a graphic sketch
in one of his letters: 'Out over the railway bridge, along a wide road
raised to the level of a ground floor above the land, which, not
being built upon, harbours puddles, ponds, pigs, and Irish hovels;
- so to the dock warehouses, four huge piles of building with no
windows, surrounded by a wall about twelve feet high - in through
the large gates, round which hang twenty or thirty rusty Irish,
playing pitch and toss and waiting for employment; - on along the
railway, which came in at the same gates and which branches down
between each vast block - past a pilot-engine butting refractory
trucks into their places - on to the last block, [and] down the
branch, sniffing the guano-scented air and detecting the old bones.

The hartshorn flavour of the guano becomes very strong, as I near the
docks where, across the ELBA'S decks, a huge vessel is discharging
her cargo of the brown dust, and where huge vessels have been discharging
that same cargo for the last five months.' This was the walk he took
his young wife on the morrow of his return. She had been used to the
society of lawyers and civil servants, moving in that circle which seems
to itself the pivot of the nation and is in truth only a clique like
another; and Fleeming was to her the nameless assistant of a nameless
firm of engineers, doing his inglorious business, as she now saw
for herself, among unsavoury surroundings. But when their walk brought
them within view of the river, she beheld a sight to her of the most
novel beauty: four great, sea-going ships dressed out with flags. 'How
lovely!' she cried. 'What is it for?' - 'For you,' said Fleeming.

Her surprise was only equalled by her pleasure. But perhaps, for what
we may call private fame, there is no life like that of the engineer;
who is a great man in out-of- the-way places, by the dockside or on
the desert island or in populous ships, and remains quite unheard of in
the coteries of London. And Fleeming had already made his mark among the
few who had an opportunity of knowing him.

His marriage was the one decisive incident of his career; from that
moment until the day of his death, he had one thought to which all the
rest were tributary, the thought of his wife. No one could know him even
slightly, and not remark the absorbing greatness of that sentiment; nor
can any picture of the man be drawn that does not in proportion dwell
upon it. This is a delicate task; but if we are to leave behind us (as
we wish) some presentment of the friend we have lost, it is a task that
must be undertaken.

For all his play of mind and fancy, for all his indulgence - and, as
time went on, he grew indulgent - Fleeming had views of duty
that were even stern. He was too shrewd a student of his fellow- men to
remain long content with rigid formulae of conduct.

Iron- bound, impersonal ethics, the procrustean bed of rules, he soon saw
at their true value as the deification of averages. 'As to Miss (I declare
I forget her name) being bad,' I find him writing, 'people only mean that
she has broken the Decalogue - which is not at all the same thing. People
who have kept in the high-road of Life really have less opportunity
for taking a comprehensive view of it than those who have leaped over
the hedges and strayed up the hills; not but what the hedges are very
necessary, and our stray travellers often have a weary time of it.
So, you may say, have those in the dusty roads.' Yet he was himself a
very stern respecter of the hedgerows; sought safety and found dignity
in the obvious path of conduct; and would palter with no simple
and recognised duty of his epoch.

Of marriage in particular, of the bond so formed, of the obligations
incurred, of the debt men owe to their children, he conceived in a
truly antique spirit: not to blame others, but to constrain himself. It
was not to blame, I repeat, that he held these views; for others, he
could make a large allowance; and yet he tacitly expected of his friends
and his wife a high standard of behaviour.

Nor was it always easy to wear the armour of that ideal.

Acting upon these beliefs; conceiving that he had indeed 'given himself'
(in the full meaning of these words) for better, for worse; painfully
alive to his defects of temper and deficiency in charm; resolute
to make up for these; thinking last of himself: Fleeming was in some
ways the very man to have made a noble, uphill fight of an unfortunate
marriage. In other ways, it is true he was one of the most unfit for
such a trial. And it was his beautiful destiny to remain to the last
hour the same absolute and romantic lover, who had shown to his new
bride the flag-draped vessels in the Mersey. No fate is altogether easy;
but trials are our touchstone, trials overcome our reward; and it was
given to Fleeming to conquer. It was given to him to live for another,
not as a task, but till the end as an enchanting pleasure. 'People
may write novels,' he wrote in 1869, 'and other people may write poems,
but not a man or woman among them can write to say how happy a man may
be, who is desperately in love with his wife after ten years of marriage.'
And again in 1885, after more than twenty-six years of marriage, and
within but five weeks of his death: 'Your first letter from
Bournemouth,' he wrote, 'gives me heavenly pleasure - for which I thank
Heaven and you too - who are my heaven on earth.' The mind hesitates
whether to say that such a man has been more good or more fortunate.

Any woman (it is the defect of her sex) comes sooner to the stable mind
of maturity than any man; and Jenkin was to the end of a most deliberate
growth. In the next chapter, when I come to deal with his telegraphic
voyages and give some taste of his correspondence, the reader will
still find him at twenty-five an arrant school-boy. His wife besides
was more thoroughly educated than he. In many ways she was able to
teach him, and he proud to be taught; in many ways she outshone
him, and he delighted to be outshone.

While, however, his men were doing this,
he was himself revolving in his mind, moodily and despairingly, plans,
not for new conflicts, but for the safest and speediest way of making
his own personal escape from the dangers around him, back to his home in
Susa.

In the mean time, the surface of the sea, far and wide in every
direction, was covered with the wrecks, and remnants, and fragments
strewed over it by the battle. Dismantled hulks, masses of entangled
spars and rigging, broken oars, weapons of every description, and the
swollen and ghastly bodies of the dead, floated on the rolling swell of
the sea wherever the winds or the currents carried them. At length many
of these mournful memorials of the strife found their way across the
whole breadth of the Mediterranean, and were driven up upon the beach on
the coast of Africa, at a barbarous country called Colias. The savages
dragged the fragments up out of the sand to use as fuel for their
fires, pleased with their unexpected acquisitions, but wholly ignorant,
of course, of the nature of the dreadful tragedy to which their coming
was due. The circumstance, however, explained to the Greeks an ancient
prophecy which had been uttered long before in Athens, and which the
interpreters of such mysteries had never been able to understand. The
prophecy was this:

     The Colian dames on Afric's shores
     Shall roast their food with Persian oars.

throne.


Mardonius, it will be recollected, was the commander-in-chief of the
forces of Xerxes, and thus, next to Xerxes himself, he was the officer
highest in rank of all those who attended the expedition. He was, in
fact, a sort of prime minister, on whom the responsibility for almost
all the measures for the government and conduct of the expedition had
been thrown. Men in such positions, while they may expect the highest
rewards and honors from their sovereign in case of success, have always
reason to apprehend the worst of consequences to themselves in case of
failure. The night after the battle of Salamis, accordingly, Mardonius
was in great fear. He did not distrust the future success of the
expedition if it were allowed to go on; but, knowing the character of
such despots as those who ruled great nations in that age of the world,
he was well aware that he might reasonably expect, at any moment, the
appearance of officers sent from Xerxes to cut off his head.

His anxiety was increased by observing that Xerxes seemed very much
depressed, and very restless and uneasy, after the battle, as if he were
revolving in his mind some extraordinary design. He presently thought
that he perceived indications that the king was planning a retreat.
Mardonius, after much hesitation, concluded to speak to him, and
endeavor to dispel his anxieties and fears, and lead him to take a more
favorable view of the prospects of the expedition. He accordingly
accosted him on the subject somewhat as follows:

"It is true," said he, "that we were not as successful in the combat
yesterday as we desired to be; but this reverse, as well as all the
preceding disasters that we have met with, is, after all, of
comparatively little moment. Your majesty has gone steadily on,
accomplishing most triumphantly all the substantial objects aimed at in
undertaking the expedition. Your troops have advanced successfully by
land against all opposition. With them you have traversed Thrace,
Macedon, and Thessaly. You have fought your way, against the most
desperate resistance, through the Pass of Thermopylæ. You have overrun
all Northern Greece. You have burned Athens. Thus, far from there being
any uncertainty or doubt in respect to the success of the expedition, we
see that all the great objects which you proposed by it are already
accomplished. The fleet, it is true, has now suffered extensive damage;
but we must remember that it is upon the army, not upon the fleet, that
our hopes and expectations mainly depend. The army is safe; and it can
not be possible that the Greeks can hereafter bring any force into the
field by which it can be seriously endangered."

By these and similar sentiments, Mardonius endeavored to revive and
restore the failing courage and resolution of the king. He found,
however, that he met with very partial success. Xerxes was silent,
thoughtful, and oppressed apparently with a sense of anxious concern.
Mardonius finally proposed that, even if the king should think it best
to return himself to Susa, he should not abandon the enterprise of
subduing Greece, but that he should leave a portion of the army under
his (Mardonius's) charge, and he would undertake, he said, to complete
the work which had been so successfully begun. Three hundred thousand
men, he was convinced, would be sufficient for the purpose.

Rosie's feelings, would not return her Most likely always what was going

sniggered.', who cannot?'He
remembered that she had counseled him not to attack the Greeks at
Salamis, and, as the result had proved that counsel to be eminently
wise, he felt the greater confidence in asking her judgment again.

He accordingly sent for Artemisia, and, directing all the officers, as
well as his own attendants, to retire, he held a private consultation
with her in respect to his plans.

[As indicated on another page, TINO'S actual opinion of his Imperial
brother-in-law is probably not too amiable; but it has to be disguised
in his letters, which are liable to be censored by his wife.]
Thank you, dear William, I am fairly well.
The climate suits me and the simple life-- No diplomats to spoil the

to talk of your career); For rumour says this bloody war will last Until
the Hohenzollerns get the boot; And through my brain the bright idea
has passed That you had better do an early scoot.

Were it not wise, dear WILLIAM, ere the day When Revolution goes
for crowns and things, To cut your loss betimes and come this way And
start a coterie of Exiled Kings?
You might (the choice of safe retreats is poor) Do worse than join me
in this happy land, And spend your last phase, careless, if obscure, With
your devoted TINO hand-in-hand.

* * * * *
MONSIEUR JOSEPH.

On the day that I left hospital, with a month's sick leave in hand,
I went to dine at my favourite Soho restaurant, the Mazarin, which I
always liked because it provided an excellent meal for an extremely
modest sum. But this evening my steps turned towards the old place because
I wanted a word with Monsieur Joseph, the head-waiter.

I found him the same genial soul as ever, though a shade stouter
perhaps and greyer at the temples, and I flatter myself that
it was with a smile of genuine pleasure that he led me to my old
table in a corner of the room.

When the crowd of diners had thinned he came to me for a chat.

"It is indeed a pleasure to see M'sieur after so long a time," said he,
"for, alas, there are so many others of our old clients who will not
ever return."
I told him that I too was glad to be sitting in the comparative quiet
of the Mazarin, and asked him how he fared.

Joseph smiled. "I 'ave a surprise for M'sieur," he said--"yes, a great
surprise. There are ten, fifteen years that I work in thees
place, and in four more weeks _le patron_ will retire and I become the
proprietor.
Oh, it is bee-utiful," he continued, clasping his hands rapturously,
"to think that in so leetle time I, who came to London a poor waiter,
shall be _patron_ of one of its finest restaurants."
I offered him my warmest congratulations. If ever a man deserved
success it was he, and it was good to see the look of pleasure on
his face as I told him so.
"And now," said I presently, "I also have a surprise for you,
Joseph."
He laughed. "Eh bien, M'sieur, it is your turn to take my breath
away."
"My last billet in France, before being wounded," I told him, "was
in a Picardy village called Fléchinelle."
He raised his hands. "Mon Dieu," he cried, "it is my own village!"

"More than that," I continued, "for nearly six weeks I lodged just
behind the church, in a whitewashed cottage with a stock of oranges,
pipes and boot-laces for sale in the window."
"It is my mother's shop!" he exclaimed breathlessly.In the course of the day he placed all his family
and family relatives on board of Artemisia's ship, under the charge of a
tried and faithful domestic. Artemisia was to convey them, as rapidly as
possible, to Ephesus, a strong city in Asia Minor, where Xerxes supposed
that they would be safe.

In the night the fleet, in obedience to the orders which Xerxes had
given them, abandoned their bridge and all their other undertakings,
and set sail. They were to make the best of their way to the Hellespont,
and post themselves there to defend the bridge of boats until Xerxes
should arrive. On the following morning, accordingly, when the sun rose,
the Greeks found, to their utter astonishment, that their enemies were
gone.

A scene of the greatest animation and excitement on board the Greek
fleet at once ensued. The commanders resolved on an immediate pursuit.
The seamen hoisted their sails, raised their anchors, and manned their
oars, and the whole squadron was soon in rapid motion. The fleet went as
far as to the island of Andros, looking eagerly all around the horizon,
in every direction, as they advanced, but no signs of the fugitives were
to be seen. The ships then drew up to the shore, and the commanders were
convened in an assembly, summoned by Eurybiades, on the land, for
consultation.

A debate ensued, in which the eternal enmity and dissension between the
Athenian and Peloponnesian Greeks broke out anew. There was, however,
now some reason for the disagreement. The Athenian cause was already
ruined. Their capital had been burned, their country ravaged, and their
wives and children driven forth to exile and misery. Nothing remained
now for them but hopes of revenge. They were eager, therefore, to press
on, and overtake the Persian galleys in their flight, or, if this could
not be done, to reach the Hellespont before Xerxes should arrive there,
and intercept his passage by destroying the bridge. This was the policy
which Themistocles advocated. Eurybiades, on the other hand, and the
Peloponnesian commanders, urged the expediency of not driving the
Persians to desperation by harassing them too closely on their retreat.
They were formidable enemies after all, and, if they were now disposed
to retire and leave the country, it was the true policy of the Greeks to
allow them to do so. To destroy the bridge of boats would only be to
take effectual measures for keeping the pest among them. Themistocles
was outvoted. It was determined best to allow the Persian forces to
retire.

Themistocles, when he found that his counsels were overruled, resorted
to another of the audacious stratagems that marked his career, which was
to send a second pretended message of friendship to the Persian king. He
employed the same Sicinnus on this occasion that he had sent before into
the Persian fleet, on the eve of the battle of Salamis. A galley was
given to Sicinnus, with a select crew of faithful men. They were all put
under the most solemn oaths never to divulge to any person, under any
circumstances, the nature and object of their commission. Storm's
opinion in other respects, says this point:" The classic form it back
about 1200.... To assume that was first written down in the saga
about 1270 or after of the tradition saga and its vivid and excellent
surely carry, I consider to be almost an impossibility."
On being admitted to an audience, he said to Xerxes that he had
been sent to him by Themistocles, whom he represented as altogether the
most prominent man among the Greek commanders, to say that the Greeks
had resolved on pressing forward to the Hellespont, to intercept him on
his return, but that he, Themistocles, had dissuaded them from it, under
the influence of the same friendship for Xerxes which had led him to
send a friendly communication to the Persians before the late battle;
that, in consequence of the arguments and persuasions of Themistocles,
the Greek squadrons would remain where they then were, on the southern
coasts, leaving Xerxes to retire without molestation.

All this was false, but Themistocles thought it would serve his purpose
well to make the statement; for, in case he should, at any future time,
in following the ordinary fate of the bravest and most successful Greek
generals, be obliged to fly in exile from his country to save his life,
it might be important for him to have a good understanding beforehand
with the King of Persia, though a good understanding, founded on
pretensions so hypocritical and empty as these, would seem to be worthy
of very little reliance. 'That dowdy old teacher!' said Ida. 'Of course
he won't marry her now.'
'She will be artful enough to try to hold him to it, you may depend on
it,' said Mrs. Morton; 'but I shall take care he knows what a shame and
disgrace it would be. Oh no; he will not dare.'

'She is awfully old,' said Ida.

'Not near so old as Miss Pottle, who was married yesterday,' said
Constance, who, at the time of her father's death, and at other times
when the presence of a young child was felt to be inconvenient at home,
had stayed with her grandmother at Hurminster, and had grown fond
of Miss Marshall.

'Don't talk about what you know nothing about, Constance,' broke in her
mother. 'Your uncle, Lord Northmoor, ain't going to lower and demean
himself by dragging a mere school teacher up into the peerage, to cut
out poor Herbert and all his family. There's that bell again! I shall
go and let Mrs. Leeson know how we are situated, and that I shall give
her notice one of these days. Clear the table, girls; we don't know who
may be dropping in.'
This done, chiefly by Constance, the sisters put on their hats, and
sallied forth with their astounding news to such of their friends
as were within reach, and by the time they had finished their
expedition they were convinced of their own nobility, and prepared
to be called Lady Ida and Lady Constance Northmoor on the spot.
When they came in they found the parlour being prepared for company,
and were sent to procure sausages and muffins for tea. Mrs.The men were at length reduced to extreme distress for food. They ate
the roots and stems of the herbage, and finally stripped the very bark
from the trees and devoured it, in the vain hope that it might afford
some nutriment to re-enforce the vital principle, for a little time at
least, in the dreadful struggle which it was waging within them. There

Hystaspes was absent in a
neighboring province. The others were at home. He had also a very
prominent officer in his court, whose name, Artabanus, was the same with
that of the uncle who had so strongly attempted to dissuade him from
undertaking the conquest of Greece. Artabanus the uncle disappears
finally from view at the time when Xerxes dismissed him to return to
Susa at the first crossing of the Hellespont. This second Artabanus was
the captain of the king's body-guard and, consequently, the common
executioner of the despot's decrees. Being thus established in his
palace, surrounded by his family, and protected by Artabanus and his
guard, the monarch felt that all his toils and dangers were over, and
that there was nothing now before him but a life of ease, of pleasure,
and of safety. Instead of this, he was, in fact, in the most imminent
danger. Artabanus was already plotting his destruction.

One day, in the midst of one of his carousals, he became angry with his
oldest son Darius for some cause, and gave Artabanus an order to kill
him. Artabanus neglected to obey this order. The king had been excited
with wine when he gave it, and Artabanus supposed that all recollection
of the command would pass away from his mind with the excitement that
occasioned it. The king did not, however, so readily forget. The next
day he demanded why his order had not been obeyed. Artabanus now began
to fear for his own safety, and he determined to proceed at once to the
execution of a plan which he had long been revolving, of destroying the
whole of Xerxes's family, and placing himself on the throne in their
stead. He contrived to bring the king's chamberlain into his schemes,
and, with the connivance and aid of this officer, he went at night into
the king's bed-chamber, and murdered the monarch in his sleep.

it( see Drayton's American change, Vol. II, leaf 172; see Fig. 10). No
one can tell what became of this emblem, yet it was placed in the
hall of defloration in a conspicuous point near the space of John
Hancock."His motive is," continued Artabanus, "to obtain the
throne, and, to make the more sure of an undisturbed possession of it,
he is intending to murder you next. Rise, therefore, and defend your
life."
