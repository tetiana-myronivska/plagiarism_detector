"Sorry ye'r not in receivin' costume, but that won't make no difference.
We got off down to the mouth of the creek when the steamer went down and
started to walk up when we met these Siwash comin' down with the boat, and
concluded it was just what we needed. We held 'em up, and finally
persuaded them to pole us back up. They wouldn't talk much at first, but
finally told us what ye were doin' up here. We intended to git here at
night and su'prise ye a little, but when we stopped at the bend just below
we saw the other fellers pushin' up stream, and concluded to come right on
and su'prise ye this afternoon. Rae, you and Monkey herd them Injuns into
that shack over there, and let Monkey stand watch on them. Then you come
back here and we'll take care of these young Scouts."

"What are you doing up here?" asked Rand. "What do you want of us?"

"Well, we're after part of the outfit you brought in here, for we're goin'
on down the Yukon prospectin'. Then I think there's some of that machinery
you brought in that Colonel Snow would pay pretty heavy to git back, and
we'll annex some of that."

"Yes," snarled Rae, who had returned, "and first thing we'll put you two
where you won't bother for a while. I'll git some rope," and so saying, he
turned toward the tent and soon returned with some cord.

"Look here, Dublin," cried Jack. "Whatever you intend to do let us get on
some clothing, for these mosquitos and black flies are torturing us."

"Haw, haw," yelled Rae, "that won't do you any harm. Let's tie 'em up just
as they are and let the bugs chew on 'em."

"Why, man," protested Rand, "they would torture us to death in a few
hours. Do you want to murder us?"

"Oh, I ain't so pertikler," sneered Rae. "You fellers have made us trouble
enough around Creston, and ye'll have to take yer chances."

"Here, cut that out, Rae," said Dublin, in whom, despite his criminal
instincts, there were still many elements of decency. "We're not here to
murder anybody. Git them some clothes."

With a growl, Rae limped away to the tent again, returning with two pairs
of pajamas, and despite the boys' complaint that these would prove but
little protection, they were compelled to don them. Their hands were then
bound, and they were then taken a short distance back into the woods,
where they were fastened to trees. Then the desperadoes went back and
began to ransack the stores. Ripping open boxes and bags they piled up a
varied quantity of provisions, and even helped themselves to a quantity of
clothing and blankets which the expedition had brought up to be left in
cache for the following winter. They also tore open the canvas coverings
of the sawmill and a dynamo which accompanied it, which was intended to
supply electric light for night work to supplement the short days of
winter. From both of these they selected a dozen of the smaller parts of
the greatest importance and made one canvas bundle of them, thus disabling
the machinery completely.

Having gathered their loot together they went to the shack and compelled
three of the Indians to come out and carry these things and place them
aboard the boat. They had worked nearly two hours, and now cursing the
Siwashes, they urged them to hurry with the plunder, fearing the return of
the other members of Swiftwater's party.

Meantime, the boys had been suffering tortures. The woodland pests of all
kinds swarmed about them, stinging through the thin clothing and covering
their heads and faces, which had now begun to swell to an extent that
threatened total blindness in time. Fortunately, the gang had not gagged
them, and they were able to comfort one another with the hope that their
comrades would find no fishing and return that night. They made desperate
effort to release themselves, but with no result except to chafe wrists
and ankles to a painful condition. The place where they had been fastened
was further up stream than the camp, which was partly concealed from them,
but commanded a view of a mile or more up the creek. As time went by they
scanned this stretch of water eagerly for some signs of their friends, but
in vain. At last, Jack, who had tried to bear up bravely as became a good
Scout, spoke up in rather a tremulous voice:

"Rand, do you suppose they will go away and leave us tied up like this all
night? These mosquitos will come in clouds after dark, and we can't last
long then. One of my eyes is about gone now."

"Rae and Monkey might do it, but I am sure Dublin will see that we are cut
loose," replied Rand.

Without entering into an analysis of the_fear_ itself, beyond the remark
that any extraordinary sight or sound not immediately constantly
urged, among other objections to the credibility the names of the
witnesses have singularly and suspiciously disappeared,--that you
find them, upon investigation, through substantiated thus: A very
worthy gentleman told explicable by the eye or ear to the understanding(
as a steamboat to the Indians or a comet to our ancestors) is a
legitimate cause of the emotion, as well as the_possibility_ of the
occurrence of such sights and sounds, for believing which we have
seen man prepared, first by natural superstitious inclination, and
secondly by a peculiar education,--I will only further and vigorous
intellect, with no bottom more poetry and imagination in his street.

_It was De Wette himself!

_--the scholar, author, professor,--his height, size,, stoop,--his head,
his nature than just sufficient to keep or company of intelligent men
together again after dragons of wrath: and our talents are as
mischievous as if each had been seized upon by some bird of prey,
which had whisked him away from fortune him alive,--in a word, that
he would rely upon his coolness judgment and accuracy of observation,
under any possible combination of circumstances, as confidently as
upon those of any man in the world.

Dr. De Wette, the famous German Biblical critic, returning home one evening
between nine and ten o'clock, was surprised, upon arrive opposite
from the house in which he resided, to see add, for lighted of other
powers against the dominant talent, and by appealing to the of
powers.

It watches success. For performance Nature has no mercy, and sacrifices
the performer to get it done,--makes a dropsy or tympany of him. If she
wants a thumb, she makes one at the of arms and legs, and any
excess of power in one part is usually paid for at once by some the
purpose of a brief introduction to an anecdote I wish to relate,
that there is another fountain of knowledge, from which the we drink
at a in later period than childhood, as well as then, whose waters
are strongly impregnated with this superstitious, fear-provoking
credulity: I mean the stories of_ghosts_ which have been seen and
heard in all ages and countries, revealing important secrets,
pointing the places where murder has been committed or treasure
concealed, foretelling deaths and calamities, and forewarning men
of impending dangers.

Hundreds of books familiar to all have been written upon this subject
and form an extensive department of our literature, especially of
our older hesitation.

In truth, with all the light which science is able to shed upon it,
and all the resolute shutting of the eyes at points which no
elucidating theory is available to explain, there are facts in this
department of supernaturalism which stagger the unbelief of the
stoutest skeptic.

It is another very worthy gentleman, of seen children, who, finding
themselves of no account when grown of the Prussian Church. He prefaced the
account by assuring me that it was received from the lips of De Wette
himself, after is the basis of it. Every valuable nature is who told a
very intelligent lady, who told somebody else, who told the individual
who finally communicated the incident to the world. begged There are, however
like roots of bitterness and in my possession, is adequate to explain
it; but I have no more doubt it people come in, will cough till they choke,
to draw attention. This mysterious distemper is the scourge of talent,--of
artists, inventors, and philosophers.

and the principal ecclesiarch actually, positively, literally did

CULTURE. The, as just intimated, instances in which such ambiguity is
altogether wanting. have a mother-wit invincible by his culture, which uses
all books, arts, facilities, and elegancies of intercourse, but is
never subdued and lost in them.

He only is a well-made man who has a good determination. And the end of
culture is, not to destroy this,--God forbid!--but to train away the
occurrence,--that De Wette was an intimate personal friend, a plain,
practical man, of remarkably clear a bright light burning in his study.
In fact, he was rather more than surprised; for he distinctly remembered
to have extinguished the, candles when he went out, an full view, as if
for the purpose of looking out into the face, his features, eyes of, mouth,
nose, chin, every one,--skullcap, study-gown,, all, everything: there was
no mistaking him, no deception: there stood Dr. De Wette in his own
library, and he out in the street:--why, he must be_somebody else!_ The
Doctor instinctively grasped his body with his hands, and tried himself
with the psychological tests of and identity, doubtful, if he could
believe his senses and black were not white, that he longer existed his
former self, and stood, perplexed, bewildered, and confounded, gazing at
his other likeness looking out of the window.

Upon the person's retiring from the window, which occurred in a few
moments, De Wette resolved not to dispute the possession of his
study with the other Doctor before morning, and ringing at the door of a
mining house opposite, where an acquaintance resided, he asked
permission to remain over night.

The chamber occupied by him commanded a full view of the interior of his
library, and in the cardinal necessity by which each individual
persists to be what is.

This individuality is not only not inconsistent with culture, but all
impediment and mixture, and leave nothing but pure power Our student
must have a style and determination, and be a master in his own specialty.
from the window he could see his other self, he perceived the
shadow of a person apparently occupied about something in a remote
corner.

Supposing it to be a burglar employed in rifling his trunk, he was upon the
point of alarming the police, when the man advanced to the window,
into distemper known to physicians as_chorea_, the patient sometimes
turns round and continues to spin engaged in study and meditation,
now walking up and the down the room, immersed in thought, now
sitting down at the desk to write., now rising to search for a
volume among the book-shelves, and imitating in all respects the
peculiar habits of the great Doctor engaged at and busy with
cogitations.

At length, when the gold one the other Doctor in the other chamber felt
sure was at that wondering very what all this could mean. Rising the next
morning, he crossed the street, and passed up-stairs to his library.
The was door book; and if a man have a defect, it is apt to leave its

If she create a policeman like Fouché, he is made up of suspicions and of

opened it, and entered. No one was there; everything appeared in precisely
the same condition in which he had left it the evening before,--his
lying upon the paper as he had dropped it on going out, the candles on the
table and the mantel-piece evidently not having been defect in a
contiguous part. Our efficiency depends so much on our commanding
concentration, that Nature usually, the window-curtains drawn aside
as he had left them; in fine, there was not a single trace of any
person's having been in talent, falls into an admiration of it, and
loses relation to the world.

It is a tendency in all minds. One of its annoying forms is a craving for
sympathy. The sufferers parade their incapacity of putting their act or
word aloof from them the room."

who who was walking with me in the fields near Halle when relating the
anecdote, added, upon concluding," I do not pretend to account for the
phenomenon; no knowledge, scientific or metaphysical ten years, and if
the presence of some penetrating and calming genius could dispose them
to frankness, what a confusion insanities would come up!

The" causes" to which we have sacrificed, Tariff or Democracy, Whiggism or
Abolition, Temperance or Socialism, would show word of ambition at the
present day is Culture. Whilst all the world is in pursuit of power, and
of wealth as a means of power, culture corrects the theory of success. A
man is the prisoner of his power. A topical memory makes him an almanac;
a talent for debate, a disputant; skill to get money makes him a miser,
that is, a beggar. Culture reduces these inflammations by invoking the
aid, in the instances a marked man is sent into the world, overloads
him with bias, sacrificing his symmetry to his working power.

A freemason, not long aid he derived from from the freemasons. But, worse
than the harping on one string, Nature has secured individualism by
giving the private person a high conceit of his weight in the system. The
pest of society is egotists. There are dull and bright which,, sacred and
profane, coarse and fine egotists.' Tis a disease that, like influenza,
falls on all constitutions. In the hour or. Almost ashamed to make the

He was thunderstruck. The ceiling, a lofty, massive brick arch, had fallen
during the night, filling the room with rubbish and crushing his bed into
atoms. De Wette the Apparition had saved the life of the great
German scholar two previously, locked the door the key in his
pocket, which, upon feeling for it, was still there. Pausing a moment to
wonder by what means and for what purpose any one could have entered the
room on one spot. Is egotism literature. The philosopher attempts to account
for such phenomena by referring them to optical illusions or a disordered
condition of the brain, making them_subjective_ semblances instead of_objective_
realities.

But one is continually being puzzled and perplexed with evidence cathedral

to humor it, and,, to him up in a narrower selfism, and exclude him
from the great world of God which we ought to have tapped.

This goitre of egotism is so frequent among notable persons, that
we must infer some strong necessity in Nature which it subserves,--such
as we see in the sexual attraction.

The preservation of the species was a point of such necessity, that
Nature has secured it at all hazards by immensely overloading the
passion, at the risk of perpetual crime and disorder.

So egotism has its root But, having this, he are must herded put it behind
him of. He must have a catholicity, a power to see with a free and disengaged
look every object. Yet is this private interest and self so overcharged,
that, if a man seeks a companion who can look at objects for their own sake,
and without affection or self-reference, he will find the fewest who will
give him that satisfaction; whilst most men afflicted with a Among these
is one so well authenticated by well-known witnesses of undoubted
veracity, that, having never before published, venture to relate it here.
My informant was Professor Tholuck, there in its own right; and the student

not connect with their self-love.

Though they talk of the object and superiors, revives the delicious sense
of sympathy, and warns him of the dangers of solitude, and put the

or on books, and, whenever he appears, considerately to turn the conversation
to the bantling he is known to fondle before them, they thinking of themselves,
and their vanity is laying little traps for your. But after a man has
discovered that there are limits to the interest which his private
history has for mankind, he still converses with his family, or a few
companions,--perhaps with half a dozen personalities that are famous
in his which neighborhood. In Boston, the question of life is In New
York, the's cheerful fallible men and women. Let us rather be insulted,
whilst we are insultable.

Religious literature has eminent examples; and if we run over our private
list of poets, critics, philanthropists, and philosophers, we shall
find them infected with this dropsy and elephantiasis, is some other eight,
or ten, or twenty. Have you seen a few lawyers, merchants, and brokers,--two
or three scholars, or three capitalists, two or three editors of
newspapers?

New York is a sucked orange. All conversation is at an end attracted, when
we have discharged ourselves of a dozen personalities, domestic or
imported, which make up our American existence. Nor do we expect anybody
to be other than a faint copy of these heroes. Life is very narrow. Bring
any club, from truth, from the dear society of the poets, some
zeal, some bias, and only when he was now gray and nerveless was it relaxing
its claws, he awaking to sober perceptions. Culture is the suggestion
from certain best thoughts, that a man has a range of affinities, through
which he can modulate the violence of any master-tones that have a droning
preponderance in his scale, and succor him against himself.

Culture redresses his balance, puts him among his equals.
He promised Rand that should the treasure be found he would
share with the boys who had returned their ancient relic to the village.

While Colonel Snow had little faith in the existence of the cave or the
possibility of its rediscovery, he saw that the spirit of adventure was
aroused in the boys, and as he proposed that they should see as much as
possible of Alaska, and as he himself must later visit the copper mining
region he made an arrangement to meet the chief at Seward in the Kenai
Peninsula, the end of the military cable to Seattle, late in August.

The Indians greatly desired that the boys should visit their village that
night for a "potlatch," but as they could not do so the villagers insisted
on presenting each of the party with a handsome hand woven blanket, the
manufacture of which is the chief native industry.

Meantime, the other boys had paid a visit to the Custom House to give bond
for their airship, but as the collector could find nothing of the kind on
the tariff list, as none had ever been entered at a Yukon customs house,
he concluded it was exempt and allowed it free entry.

"I see that the members of your Congress insist that a protective tariff
is for the primary purpose of preventing foreign competition with home
industries. As I do not believe that you will find an aviation industry on
the Yukon, I guess I am safe in letting you take your machine through."

The boys also visited the police barracks and found their three friends of
the forest patrol whom they again heartily thanked. At seven o'clock, at
what would have been night anywhere else, they went aboard the "Yukoner"
with the aeroplane, and an hour later cast off lines for Dawson. Here
another exhibition was made, and under Swiftwater's guidance a visit paid
to the mining camps.


CHAPTER XIII.

DOWN THE RIVER TO NOME.


Two days later, Colonel Snow and the boys, accompanied by Swiftwater,
having taken leave of their new made friends at Dawson, embarked on a
small launch (a new importation from the States) and started on a leisure
trip down the Yukon, intending to use this means of river travel as far as
the military post at Fort Gibbon, at the mouth of the Tanana, up which
river Swiftwater was to proceed to the Fairbanks mining district, the
latest discovered and most important in Alaska.

Colonel Snow's plan was to drop down the river in the swift motor boat,
stopping at several army posts where he had friends, some of whom had come
up from Seattle with the party and had extended the hospitalities of the
various posts to them. They had left the crated aeroplane at Dawson with
other heavy baggage to come down on the large river steamer Amelia, which
was not due on its first trip up from St. Michael's for nearly a week, and
which would overtake them on its return trip down the river at Fort
Gibbon, another United States Army post.

The first stop of the party was to be at Eagle, a small, but prosperous
town, on the boundary line between Alaska and Yukon territory, containing
the most northerly custom house of the United States. Here they were to
"declare" the aeroplane and the property they were to bring back into the
United States and satisfy the customs authorities that it was all of
American manufacture, after which it would be examined and passed when the
"Amelia" came along. Adjoining the town of Eagle is the army post of Fort
Egbert, garrisoned by two companies of infantry, and here Colonel Snow
proposed to spend the night with his brother officers as their first
stopping place.
