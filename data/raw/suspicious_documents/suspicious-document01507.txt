PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR.


Louis XVI. possessed an immense crowd of confidants, advisers, and guides;
he selected them even from among the factions which attacked him. Never,
perhaps, did he make a full disclosure to any one of them, and certainly
he spoke with sincerity, to but very few.  He invariably kept the reins of
all secret intrigues in his own hand; and thence, doubtless, arose the
want of cooperation and the weakness which were so conspicuous in his
measures.  From these causes considerable chasms will be found in the
detailed history of the Revolution.

In order to become thoroughly acquainted with the latter years of the
reign of Louis XV., memoirs written by the Duc de Choiseul, the Duc
d'Aiguillon, the Marechal de Richelieu,

[I heard Le Marechal de Richelieu desire M. In the 3rd Book of Manu (v.
22), it is included among the various marriage rites, and is said to be
a union proceeding entirely from love, or mutual inclination, and concluded
without any religious services, and without consulting relatives. It was
recognized as a legal marriage by Manu and other lawgivers, though it is
difficult to say in what respect it differed from unlawful
cohabitation.

56.

_The loving birds doomed by fate to nightly separation_.

That is, the male and female of the Chakraváka, commonly called Chakwa and
Chakwí, or Bráhmaní duck (_Anas casarca_). These birds associate
together during the day, and are, like turtle-doves, patterns of
connubial affection; but the legend is, that they are doomed to pass
the night apart, in consequence of a curse pronounced upon them
by a saint whom they had offended. As soon as night commences, they take
up their station on the opposite banks of a river, and call to each other
in piteous cries. The Bengálís consider their flesh to be a good medicine
for fever.

57. _The great sage Durvásas_.

A Saint or Muni, represented by the Hindú poets as excessively choleric
and inexorably severe. The Puránas and other poems contain frequent
accounts of the terrible effects of his imprecations on various occasions,
the slightest offence being in his eyes deserving of the most fearful
punishment. On one occasion he cursed Indra, merely because his elephant
let fall a garland he had given to this god; and in consequence of this
imprecation all plants withered, men ceased to sacrifice, and the gods
were overcome in their wars with the demons.

58. _Propitiatory offering_.

Compare note 25.

59. _His blushing charioteer_.

Compare note 11.

60. _Night-loving lotus_.

Some species of the lotus, especially the white esculent kind, open their
petals during the night, and close them during the day, whence the moon
is often called the 'lover, or lord of the lotuses.'
61. _The very centre of the sacred fire_.

Fire was an important object of veneration with the Hindús, as with the
ancient Persians. Perhaps the chief worship recognized in the Vedas
is that of Fire and the Sun.

The holy fire was deposited in a hallowed part of the house, or in a sacred
building, and kept perpetually burning. Every morning and evening, oblations
were offered to it by dropping clarified butter and other substances
into the flame, accompanied with prayers and invocations.

62.

_As in the sacred tree the mystic fire_.

Literally, 'as the [S']ami-tree is pregnant with fire.' The legend is, that
the goddess Párvatí, being one day under the influence of love, reposed
on a trunk of this tree, whereby a sympathetic warmth was generated in
the pith or interior of the wood, which ever after broke into a sacred
flame on the slightest attrition.

63 _Hastinápur_.

The ancient Delhi, situated on the Ganges, and the capital of Dushyanta.
Its site is about fifty miles from the modern Delhi, which is on the Jumná,

64 _E'en as Yayáti [S']armishthá adored_,
[S']armishthá was the daughter of Vrishaparvan, king of the demons, and
wife of Yayáti, son of Nahusha, one of the princes of the Lunar
dynasty, and ancestor of Dushyanta. Puru was the son of Yayáti, by
[S']armishthá.

65 _And for whose encircling bed, Sacred Kusa-grass is spread_.

At a sacrifice, sacred fires were lighted at the four cardinal points,
and Ku[s']a-grass was scattered around each fire, 66 _Koïl_,
The Koïl, or Kokil, is the Indian cuckoo.

It is sometimes called Para-bhrita ('nourished by another').
because the female is known to leave her eggs in the nest of the crow to
be hatched. The bird is as great a favourite with Indian poets as the
nightingale with European. One of its names is 'Messenger of Spring.' Its
note is a constant subject of allusion, and is described as beautifully
sweet, and, if heard on a journey, indicative of good fortune.
Everything, however, is beautiful by comparison. The song of the Koïl is not
only very dissimilar, but very inferior to that of the nightingale,
67 _The peacock on the lawn Ceases its dance_,

The Indian peacock is very restless, especially at the approach of
rain, in which it is thought to take delight. Its circular movements are
a frequent subject of allusion with Hindú poets, and are often by
them compared to dancing.

68. _The moonlight of the grove_.

The name of [S']akoontalá's favourite jasmine, spoken of in the 1st Act.
See page 15 of this volume.

69. _Fig-tree_.

Not the Banyan-tree (_Ficus Indica_), nor the Pippala (_Ficus religiosa_),
but the Glomerous Fig-tree (_Ficus glomerata_), which yields a resinous
milky juice from its bark, and is large enough to afford abundant
shade.

70.

_The poor female Chakraváka_.

Compare note 56.

71.

_Like a young tendril of the sandal-tree torn from its home in the
western mountains_.

The sandal is a kind of large myrtle with pointed leaves (_Sirium
myrtifolium_).

The wood affords many highly esteemed perfumes, unguents, etc., and is
celebrated for its delicious scent. It is chiefly found on the slopes of
the Malaya mountain or Western Ghauts on the Malabar coast. The roots of
the tree are said to be infested with snakes.

Indeed it seems to pay dearly for the fragrance of its wood: 'The root is
infested by serpents, the blossoms by bees, the branches by
monkeys, the summit by bears.
In short there is not a part of the sandal-tree that is not occupied by
the vilest impurities.' Hitopade[s']a, verse 162.

72. _The calm seclusion of thy former home_.

'When the father of a family perceives his own wrinkles and grey hair,
committing the care of his wife to his sons, or accompanied by
her, let him repair to the woods and become a hermit.'

--Manu, vi. 2. It was usual for kings, at a certain time of life, to
abdicate the throne in favour of the heir-apparent, and pass the
remainder of their days in seclusion.

73. _A frequent offering to our household gods_.

This was an offering (_bali_) in honour of those spiritual beings
called 'household deities,' which were supposed to hover round and protect
houses. It was made by throwing up into the air in some part of the house
(generally at the door) the remains of the morning and evening
meal of rice or grain, uttering at the same time a _mantra_, or prayer.

74. _In other states of being_.

Dim recollections of occurrences in former states of existence are supposed
occasionally to cross the mind. Compare note 37.

75. _The Chamberlain_.

The attendant on the women's apartment.

He is generally a Bráhman, and usually appears in the plays as a tottering
and decrepit old man, leaning on his staff of office. 76. _The king of
serpents on his thousand heads_.

A mythological serpent, the personification of eternity, and king of the
Nágas, or snakes, who inhabit Pátála, the lowermost of the seven
regions below the earth.

His body formed the couch of Vishnu, reposing on the waters of Chaos, whilst
his thousand heads were the god's canopy. He is also said to uphold
the world on one of his heads.

77. _The chamber of the consecrated fire_.

Compare note 61.

78. _Two heralds_.

These heralds were introduced into Hindú plays something in the same manner
as a Chorus; and, although their especial duty was to announce, in
measured verse, the periods of the day, and particularly the fixed
divisions into which the king's day was divided, yet the strain
which they poured forth frequently contained allusions to incidental
circumstances.

The royal office was no sinecure. From the Da[s']a-kumára, it
appears that the day and night were each divided into eight portions of
one hour and a half, reckoned from sunrise; and were thus distributed:
Day--l.
The king, being dressed, is to audit accounts; 2. He is to pronounce
judgment in appeals; 3. He is to breakfast; 4.

He is to receive and make presents; 5. He is to discuss political questions
with his ministers; 6. He is to amuse himself; 7. He is to review his
troops; 8. He is to hold a military council.
Night--l. He is to receive the reports of his spies and envoys; 2. He is
to sup or dine; 3. He is to retire to rest after the perusal of some
sacred work; 4 and 5. He is to sleep; 6. He is to rise and purify
himself; 7. He is to hold a private consultation with his ministers, and
instruct his officers; 8. He is to attend upon the _Purohita_ or family
priest, for the performance of religious ceremonies. See Wilson's Hindú
Theatre, vol. i. p. 209.

79. _Feeling a quivering sensation in her right eyelid_.

Compare note 18.

80. _The protector of the four classes of the people, the guardian of
the four conditions of the priesthood_.

A remarkable feature in the ancient Hindú social system, as depicted in
the plays, was the division of the people into four classes or
castes:--1st. The sacerdotal, consisting of the Bráhmans.--2nd.
The military, consisting of fighting men, and including the king himself
and the royal family. This class enjoyed great privileges, and must
have been practically the most powerful.--3rd.

The commercial, including merchants and husbandmen.--4th. The servile,
consisting of servants and slaves.
Of these four divisions the first alone has been preserved in its purity
to the present day, although the Rájputs claim to be the representatives
of the second class. The others have been lost in a multitude of mixed
castes formed by intermarriage, and bound together by similarity of trade
or occupation. With regard to the sacerdotal class, the Bráhmans,
who formed it, were held to be the chief of all human beings; they were
superior to the king, and their lives and property were protected by the
most stringent laws. They were to divide their lives into four
quarters, during which they passed through four
states or conditions, viz. as religious students, as householders, as
anchorites, and as religious mendicants.

81. _That he is pleased with ill-assorted unions_.

The god Brahmá seems to have enjoyed a very unenviable notoriety as taking
pleasure in ill-assorted marriages, and encouraging them by his own
example in the case of his own daughter.

82. _[S']achí's sacred pool near Sakrávatára_.

[S']akra is a name of the god Indra, and Sakrávatára is a sacred place
of pilgrimage where he descended upon earth. [S']achí is his wife, to whom
a _Urtha_, or holy bathing-place, was probably consecrated at the place
where [S']akoontalá had performed her ablutions. Compare note
14.

83. _The wily Koïl_.

Compare note 66.

84. _With the discus or mark of empire in the lines of his hand_.

When the lines of the right hand formed themselves into a circle, it was
thought to be the mark of a future hero or emperor.

85. _A most refined occupation, certainly!_
Spoken ironically. The occupation of a fisherman, and, indeed, any
occupation which involved the sin of slaughtering animals, was considered
despicable. Fishermen, butchers, and leather-sellers were equally objects
of scorn.

In Lower Bengal the castes of Jáliyás and Bágdis, who live by fishing,
etc., are amongst the lowest, and eke out a precarious livelihood by
thieving and dacoity.

86. _And he should not forsake it_.

The great Hindú lawgiver is very peremptory in restricting special occupations
(such as fishing, slaughtering animals, basket-making) to the mixed and
lowest castes. 'A man of the lowest caste, who, through covetousness, lives
by the acts of the highest, let the king strip of all his wealth and
banish. His own business, though badly performed, is preferable to
that of another, though well performed.'--Manu, x. 96. In the later
Hindú
system the sacrifice of animals is practised by the priests of the
goddess Káli only.

87.

_Carp_.

That is, the Rohita, or Rohi (red) fish (_Cyprinus rohita_), a kind of carp
found in lakes and ponds in the neighbourhood of the Ganges. It grows
to the length of three feet, is very voracious, and its flesh,
though it often has a muddy taste, is edible. Its back is olive-coloured,
its belly of a golden hue, its fins and eyes red. This fish is often caught
in tanks in Lower Bengal of the weight of twenty-five or thirty pounds.

88. _I long to begin binding the flowers round his head_.

It is evident from the Málati-Mádhava, and other plays, that a victim, about
to be offered as a sacrifice, had a wreath of flowers bound round the
head.

89. _The great vernal festival_.

In celebration of the return of Spring, and said to be in honour of
Krishna, and of his son Káma-deva, the god of love. It is identified with
the Holí or Dolá-yátra, the Saturnalia, or rather, Carnival of the
Hindús, when people of all conditions take liberties with each other,
especially by scattering red powder and coloured water on the clothes of
persons passing in the street, as described in the play called
Ratnávalí, where the crowd are represented as using syringes and
waterpipes.

Flowers, and especially the opening blossoms of the mango, would naturally
be much employed for decoration at this festival, as an offering to the
god of love. It was formerly held on the full moon of the month Chaitra,
or about the beginning of April, but it is now celebrated on the full moon
of Phálguna, or about the beginning of March. The other great Hindú
festival, held in the autumn, about October, is called Durgá-pújá, being
in honour of the goddess Durgá. The Holí festival is now so disfigured
by unseemly practices and coarse jests that it is reprobated by the
respectable natives, and will probably, in the course of time, either die
out or be prohibited by legal enactment.

90. _Am not I named after the Koïl?_
Compare note 66.

91. _Thy fire unerring shafts_.

Compare note 47.

92. _The amaranth_
That is, the Kuruvaka, either the crimson amaranth, or a purple species of
_Barleria_.

93. _My finger burning with the glow of love_.

However offensive to our notions of good taste, it is certain that, in
Hindú erotic poetry, a hot hand is considered to be one of the
signs of passionate love.

Compare Othello, Act III. Scene 4. 'Give me your hand: this hand is moist,
my lady--hot, hot, and moist.'
94. _The airy vapours of the desert_.

A kind of mirage floating over waste places, and appearing at a distance
like water. Travellers and some animals, especially deer, are supposed to
be attracted and deceived by it.

95. _Himálaya_.

The name of this celebrated range of mountains is derived from two Sanskrit
words, _hima_, 'ice' or 'snow' (Lat. _hiems_), and _álaya_, 'abode.' The
pronunciation Himalaya is incorrect.

96. _As [S']iva did the poison at the Deluge_.

At the churning of the ocean, after the Deluge, by the gods and demons,
for the recovery or production of fourteen sacred things, a deadly
poison called Kála-kúta, or Halá-hala, was generated, so virulent
that it would have destroyed the world, had not the god [S']iva
swallowed it.

Its only effect was to leave a dark blue mark on his throat, whence
his name Níla-kantha. This name is also given to a beautiful bird, not
wholly unlike our jay, common in Bengal.

97. _Palace of clouds_.

The palace of King Dushyanta, so called because it was lofty as the
clouds.
98. _The foreman of a guild belonging to Ayodhyá_.
The chief of a guild or corporation of artisans practising the same
trade. Ayodhyá, or the Invincible City, was the ancient capital of
Rámachandra, founded by Ikshwáku, the first of the Solar dynasty.
It was situated on the river Sarayu in the north of India, and is
now called Oude.
99. _My ancestors Must drink these glistening tears, the last
libation_.
Oblations to the spirits of the deceased are offered by the nearest
surviving relatives soon after the funeral ceremonies; and are
repeated once in every year. They are supposed to be necessary to
secure the well-being of the souls of the dead in the world
appropriated to them. The oblation-ceremony is called [S']ráddha,
and generally consisted in offering balls made of rice and milk,
or in pouring out water, or water and sesamum-seed mixed. These
ceremonies are still regarded as essential to the welfare of deceased
persons, and their celebration is marked by magnificent feasts, to
which relations and a host of Bráhmans are invited. A native who
had grown rich in the time of Warren Hastings spent nine lakhs of
rupees on his mother's [S']ráddha; and large sums are still spent
on similar occasions by wealthy Hindús (see my 'Bráhmanism and
Hindúism,' p. 306).

100. _The mother of the great Indra_.
That is, Adití, the wife of Ka[s']yapa, with whom, in their sacred
retreat, [S']akoontalá was enjoying an asylum.
101. _Distinguishes the milk from worthless water_.
The Hindús imagine that the flamingo (a kind of goose) is the vehicle
on which the god Brahmá is borne through the air; and that this
bird, being fond of the pulpy fibres of the water-lily, has been
gifted by him with the power of separating the milky from the watery
portion of the juice contained in the stalk of that plant.
102. _Mátali_.
The charioteer of Indra. In the pictures which represent this god
mounted on his usual vehicle--an elephant called Aírávata--Mátali
is seen seated before him on the withers of the animal, acting as
its driver. In the plays, however, Indra is generally represented
borne in a chariot drawn by two horses, guided by Mátali.
103. _Kálanemi_.
A Daitya or demon, with a hundred arms and as many heads.
104. _Nárada_.
A celebrated divine sage, usually reckoned among the ten patriarchs
first created by Brahmá. He acted as a messenger of the gods.
105. _Tinged with celestial sandal from the breast_.
The breast of Indra was dyed yellow with a fragrant kind of sandal-wood
(_hari-chandana_); and the garland by rubbing against it, became
tinged with the same color. Wreaths and garlands of flowers are
much used by the Hindús as marks of honorary distinction, as well
as for ornament or festive occasions. They are suspended round the
neck.

106. _The ever-blooming tree of Nandana_.
That is, Mandára, one of the five ever-blooming trees of Nandana,
or Swarga, Indra's heaven. The two most celebrated of these trees
were the Párijáta and the Kalpa-druma, or tree granting all desires.
Each of the superior Hindú gods has a heaven, paradise, or elysium
of his own. That of Brahmá is called Brahma-loka, situate on the
summit of mount Meru; that of Vishnu is Vaikuntha, on the Himálayas;
that of [S']iva and Kuvera is Kailása, also on the Himálayas; that
of Indra is Swarga or Nandana. The latter, though properly on the
summit of mount Meru, below Brahmá's paradise, is sometimes identified
with the sphere of the sky or heaven in general. It is the only
heaven of orthodox Bráhmanism.

107. _Jayanta_.
The son of Indra by his favourite wife Paulomí or [S']achí.
108. _The Lion-man's terrific claws_.
Vishnu, in the monstrous shape of a creature half man, half lion
(his fourth Avatár or incarnation), delivered the three worlds,
that is to say, Earth, Heaven, and the lower regions, from the
tyranny of an insolent demon called Hiranya-ka[S']ipu.
109. _We journey in the path of Parivaha_.
The Hindús divide the heavens into seven Márgas, paths or orbits,
assigning a particular wind to each. The sixth of these paths is
that of the Great Bear, and its peculiar wind is called Parivaha.
This wind is supposed to bear along the seven stars of Ursa Major,
and to propel the heavenly Ganges.

110. _The triple Ganges_.
The Ganges was supposed to take its rise in the toe of Vishnu (whence
one of its names, Vishnu-padí); thence it flowed through the heavenly
sphere, being borne along by the wind Parivaha, and identified with
the Mandákiní, or Milky Way. Its second course is through the earth;
but the weight of its descent was borne by [S']iva's head, whence,
after wandering among the tresses of his hair, it descended through
a chasm in the Himálayas. Its third course is through Pátála, or
the lower regions, the residence of the Daityas and Nágas, and not
to be confounded with Naraka, 'hell,' 'the place of punishment.'
111. _He spanned the heavens in his second stride_.
The story of Vishnu's second stride was this:--An Asura or Daitya,
named Bali, had, by his devotions, gained the dominion of Heaven,
Earth, and Pátála. Vishnu undertook to trick him out of his power,
and assuming the form of a Vámana, or dwarf (his fifth Avatár), he
appeared before the giant and begged as a boon as much land as he
could pace in three steps. This was granted; and the god immediately
expanded himself till he filled the world; deprived Bali, at the
first step, of Earth; at the second, of Heaven; but, in consideration
of some merit, left Pátála still under his rule.
112. _I see the moisture-loving Chátakas_.
The Chátaka is a kind of Cuckoo (_Cuculus Melanoleucus_). The Hindús
suppose that it drinks only the water of the clouds, and their poets
usually introduce allusions to this bird in connexion with cloudy
or rainy weather.

113. _Golden-peak_.
A sacred range of mountains lying among the Himálaya chain, and
apparently identical with, or immediately adjacent to, Kailása, the
paradise of Kuvera, the god of wealth. It is here described as the
mountain of the Kimpurashas, or servants of Kuvera. They are a
dwarfish kind of monster, with the body of a man and the head of a
horse, and are otherwise called Kinnara.

114. _Ka[s']yapa_.
Ka[s']yapa was the son of Brahmá's son, Maríchi, and was one of
those Patriarchs (created by Brahmá to supply the universe with
inhabitants) who, after fulfilling their mission, retired from the
world to practise penance.He was injudiciously advised to get rid of it by the use of extract of
lead, which proved effectual; but from that time the Dauphin, who was
corpulent, insensibly grew thin, and a short, dry cough evinced that the
humour, driven in, had fallen on the lungs.  Some persons also suspected
him of having taken acids in too great a quantity for the purpose of
reducing his bulk.  The state of his health was not, however, such as to
excite alarm.  At the camp at Compiegne, in July, 1764, the Dauphin
reviewed the troops, and evinced much activity in the performance of his
duties; it was even observed that he was seeking to gain the attachment of
the army.  He presented the Dauphiness to the soldiers, saying, with a
simplicity which at that time made a great sensation, 'Mes enfans, here is
my wife.'  Returning late on horseback to Compiegne, he found he had taken
a chill; the heat of the day had been excessive; the Prince's clothes had
been wet with perspiration.  An illness followed, in which the Prince
began to spit blood.  His principal physician wished to have him bled; the
consulting physicians insisted on purgation, and their advice was
followed.  The pleurisy, being ill cured, assumed and retained all the
symptoms of consumption; the Dauphin languished from that period until
December, 1765, and died at Fontainebleau, where the Court, on account of
his condition, had prolonged its stay, which usually ended on the 2d of
November.

"The Dauphiness, his widow, was deeply afflicted; but the immoderate
despair which characterised her grief induced many to suspect that the
loss of the crown was an important part of the calamity she lamented. She
long refused to eat enough to support life; she encouraged her tears to
flow by placing portraits of the Dauphin in every retired part of her
apartments.  She had him represented pale, and ready to expire, in a
picture placed at the foot of her bed, under draperies of gray cloth, with
which the chambers of the Princesses were always hung in court mournings.
Their grand cabinet was hung with black cloth, with an alcove, a canopy,
and a throne, on which they received compliments of condolence after the
first period of the deep mourning.  The Dauphiness, some months before the
end of her career, regretted her conduct in abridging it; but it was too
late; the fatal blow had been struck.  It may also be presumed that living
with a consumptive, man had contributed to her complaint.  This Princess
had no opportunity of displaying her qualities; living in a Court in which
she was eclipsed by the King and Queen, the only characteristics that
could be remarked in her were her extreme attachment to her husband, and
her great piety.

"The Dauphin was little known, and his character has been much mistaken.
He himself, as he confessed to his intimate friends, sought to disguise
it.  He one day asked one of his most familiar servants, 'What do they say
in Paris of that great fool of a Dauphin?' The person interrogated seeming
confused, the Dauphin urged him to express himself sincerely, saying,
'Speak freely; that is positively the idea which I wish people to form of
me.'

"As he died of a disease which allows the last moment to be anticipated
long beforehand, he wrote much, and transmitted his affections and his
prejudices to his son by secret notes.

So, without sound of builder or stroke of hammer, goes up, day by day,
the body--the glorious temple of the soul.

DISEASES ETC.--1. _Dyspepsia_, or indigestion of food, is generally
caused by an overtaxing of the digestive organs. Too much food is used,
and the entire system is burdened by the excess. Meals are taken at irregular
hours, when the fluids are not ready. A hearty supper is eaten when the
body, wearied with the day's labor, demands rest. The appetite craves
no food when the digestion is enfeebled, but stimulants and condiments
excite it, and the unwilling organs are oppressed by that which they can
not properly manage.

Strong tea, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco derange the alimentary function.

Too great variety of dishes, rich food, tempting flavors,--all lead to an
overloading of the stomach. This patient, long-suffering member at
last wears out. Pain, discomfort, diseases of the digestive organs, and
insufficient nutrition are the penalties of violated laws. (See p. 328.)

2. _The Mumps_ are an inflammation of the parotid and submaxillary glands
(see p. 159). The disease is generally epidemic, and is believed to be
contagious; the patient should therefore be carefully secluded for the
sake of others as well as himself.

The swelling may be allowed to take its course. Relief from pain is often
experienced by applying flannels wrung out of hot water. Great care should
be used not to check the inflammation, and, on first going out after
recovery, not to take cold.

ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AND NARCOTICS.

1. ALCOHOL (Continued from p. 147).

RELATION OF ALCOHOL TO THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.--_Is Alcohol a Food?_ To answer
this question, let us make a comparison. If you receive into your stomach
a piece of bread or beef, Nature welcomes its presence. The juices of the
system at once take hold of it, dissolve it, and transform it for the uses
of the body. A million tiny fingers (lacteals and veins) reach out to grasp
it, work it over, and carry it into the circulation. The blood bears it
onward wherever it is needed to mend or to build "The house you live in."
Soon, it is no longer bread or beef; it is flesh on your arm; its
chemical energy is imparted to you, and it becomes your strength.

If, on the other hand, you take into your stomach a little alcohol, it
receives no such welcome. Nature treats it as a poison, and seeks to rid
herself of the intruder as soon as possible. [Footnote: Food is digested,
alcohol is not. Food warms the blood, directly or indirectly; alcohol
lowers the temperature. Food nourishes the body, in the sense of assimilating
itself to the tissues; alcohol does not. Food makes blood; alcohol never
does anything more innocent than mixing with it. Food feeds the blood
cells; alcohol destroys them. Food excites, in health, to normal action
only; alcohol tends to inflammation and disease. Food gives force to the
body; alcohol excites reaction and wastes force, in the first place, and
in the second, as a true narcotic, represses vital action and corresponding
nutrition.--If alcohol does not act like food, neither does it behave like
water. Water is the subtle but innocent vehicle of circulation, which
dissolves the solid food, holds in play the chemical and vital reactions
of the tissues, conveys the nutritive solutions from cell to cell, from
tube to tube, and carries off and expels the effete matter. Water
neither irritates tissue, wastes force, nor suppresses vital action: whereas
alcohol does all three. Alcohol hardens solid tissue, thickens the
blood, narcotizes the nerves, and in every conceivable direction
antagonizes the operation and function of water--LEES.] The juices
of the system will flow from every pore to dilute and weaken it,
and to prevent its shriveling up the delicate membranes with which it
comes in contact. The veins will take it up and bear it rapidly through
the system. Every organ of elimination, all the scavengers of the body--
the lungs, the kidneys, the perspiration glands, at once set to work to
throw off the enemy. So surely is this the case, that the breath of
a person who has drunk only a single glass of the lightest beer will betray
the fact.

The alcohol thus eliminated is entirely unchanged. Nature apparently
makes no effort to appropriate it. [Footnote: It was formerly a question
considerably discussed, whether alcohol exists in the brain, or in the
fluid found in the ventricles, in intoxicated persons. This was settled
by Percy, who found alcohol in the brain and liver of dogs poisoned with
alcohol, and of men who had died after excessive drinking. In these
experiments, the presence of alcohol was determined by distillation, and
the distilled substance burned with a blue flame, and dissolved camphor.--
FLINT'S _Physiology of Man_.] It courses everywhere through the circulation,
and into the great organs, with all its properties unmodified.

Alcohol, then, is not, like bread or beef, taken hold of, broken up by the
mysterious process of digestion, and used by the body.

[Footnote: Because of the difficulties of such an experiment, we have
not yet been able to account satisfactorily by the excretions for
all the alcohol taken into the stomach. This remains as yet one of the
unsolved problems of physiological chemistry. To collect the whole of
the insensible perspiration, for example, is well-nigh impossible. It
was supposed at one time that a part of the alcohol is oxidized--_i.
e._, burned, in the system. But such a process would impart heat, and
it is now proved that alcohol cools, instead of warms, the blood. Moreover,
the closest analysis fails to detect in the circulation any trace of the
products of alcoholic combustion, such as aldehyde and acetic acid. "The
fact," says Flint, "that alcohol is always eliminated, even when
drunk in minute quantity, and that its elimination continues for
a considerable time, gradually diminishing, renders it probable
that all that is taken into the body is removed."]

"It can not therefore be regarded as an aliment," or food.-- FLINT.
"Beer, wine, and spirits," says Liebig, "contain no element capable of
entering into the composition of the blood or the muscular fiber." [Footnote:
The small amount of nutritive substance, chiefly sugar derived from the
grain or fruit used in the manufacture of beer or wine, can not, of course,
be compared with that contained in bread or beef at the same cost.
Liebig says, in his Letters on Chemistry, "We can prove, with mathematical
certainty, that as much flour as can lie on the point of a table knife is
more nutritious than eight quarts of the best Bavarian beer."] "That
alcohol is incapable of forming any part of the body," remarks Cameron,
"is admitted by all physiologists. It can not be converted into brain,
nerve, muscle, or blood."
EFFECT UPON THE DIGESTION. [Footnote: The medical value of alcohol in its
relations to digestion is not discussed in this book. The experiments of
Dr. Henry Munroe, of Hull, published in the London _Medical Journal_, are
here summarized as showing that the tendency to retard digestion is common
to all forms of alcoholic
drinks.

--Experiments tend to prove that alcohol coagulates and precipitates
the pepsin from the gastric juice, and so puts a stop to its great
work in the process of digestion.

The greed of alcohol for water causes it to imbibe moisture from the tissues
and juices, and to inflame the delicate mucous membrane. It shows the power
of Nature to adapt herself to circumstances, that the soft, velvety
lining of the throat and stomach should come at length to endure the
presence of a fiery liquid which, undiluted, would soon shrivel and
destroy it. In self-defense, the juices pour in to weaken the alcohol, and
it is soon hurried into the circulation. Before this can be done, "it
must absorb about three times its bulk of water"; hence, very strong
liquor may be retained in the stomach long enough to interfere seriously
with the digestion, and to injure the lining coat. Habitual use of alcohol
permanently dilates the blood vessels; thickens and hardens the
membranes; in some cases, ulcerates the surface; and, finally, "so weakens
the assimilation that the proper supply of food can not be appropriated."
--FLINT. [Footnote: The case of St. Martin (p. 168) gave an excellent
opportunity to watch the action of alcohol upon the stomach. Dr. Beaumont
summarized his experiments thus: "The free, ordinary use of any intoxicating
liquor, when continued for some days, invariably produced inflammation,
ulcerous patches, and, finally, a discharge of morbid matter tinged
with blood." Yet St. Martin never complained of pain in his stomach, the
narcotic influence of the alcohol preventing the signal of danger that
Nature ordinarily gives.]
EFFECT UPON THE LIVER.--Alcohol is carried by the portal vein directly to
the liver. This organ, after the brain, holds the largest share. The influence
of the poison is here easily traced.

"The color of the bile is soon changed from yellow to green, and even to
black;" the connective tissue between the lobules becomes inflamed; and,
in the case of a confirmed drunkard, hardened and shrunk, the surface
often assuming a nodulated appearance known as the "hobnailed liver."
Morbid matter is sometimes deposited, causing what is called "Fatty
degeneration," so that the liver is increased to twice or thrice its natural
size.

EFFECT UPON THE KIDNEYS.--The kidneys, like the liver, are liable in time
to undergo, through the influence of alcohol, a "Fatty degeneration," in
which the cells become filled with particles of fat; [Footnote: Disabled
by the fatty deposits, the kidneys are unable to separate the waste matter
coming to them for elimination from the system. The poisonous material is
poured back into the circulation, and often delirium ensues.--HUBBARD.

Richardson states that his experience "is to the effect that seven out
of every eight instances of kidney disease are attributable to alcohol."]
the vessels lose their contractility; and, worst of all, the membranes
may be so modified as to allow the albuminous part of the blood to
filter through them, and so to rob the body of one of its most valuable
constituents.
[Footnote: This deterioration of structure frequently gives rise to what
is known as "Bright's Disease."--RICHARDSON.]
DOES ALCOHOL IMPART HEAT?--During the first flush after drinking wine,
for example, a sense of warmth is felt. This is due to the tides of warm
blood that are being sent to the surface of the body, owing to the
vascular enlargement and to the rapid pumping of the heart. There is,
however, no fresh heat developed. On the contrary, the bringing the blood
to the surface causes it to cool faster, reaction sets in, a chilliness is
experienced as one becomes sober, and a delicate thermometer placed
under the tongue of the inebriate may show a fall of even two degrees
below the standard temperature of the body. Several hours are required
to restore the usual heat.

As early as 1850, Dr. N. S. Davis, of Chicago, ex-President of the American
Medical Association, instituted an extensive series of experiments to
determine the effect of the different articles of food and drinks on the
temperature of the system. He conclusively proved that, during the
digestion of all kinds of food, the temperature of the body is increased,
but when alcohol is taken, either in the form of fermented or distilled
beverages, the temperature begins to fall within a half hour, and continues
to decrease for two or three hours, and that the reduction of temperature,
in extent as well as in duration, is in exact proportion to the amount
of alcohol taken.

It naturally follows that, contrary to the accepted opinion, liquor
does not fortify against cold. The experience of travelers at the North
coincides with that of Dr. Hayes, the Arctic explorer, who says: "While
fat is absolutely essential to the inhabitants and travelers in arctic
countries, alcohol is, in almost any shape, not only completely useless,
but positively injurious. I have known strong, able-bodied men to
become utterly incapable of resisting cold in consequence of the long-continued
use of alcoholic drink."
DOES ALCOHOL IMPART STRENGTH?--Experience shows that alcohol weakens
the power of undergoing severe bodily exertion. [Footnote: Dr. McRae,
in speaking of Arctic exploration, at the meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, held at Montreal in 1856, said: "The
moment that a man had swallowed a drink of spirits, it was certain
that his day's work was nearly at an end.

It was absolutely necessary that the rule of total abstinence be rigidly
enforced, if we would accomplish our day's task. The use of liquor as
a beverage when we had work on hand, in that terrific cold, was out
of the question."] Men who are in training for running, rowing,
and other contests where great strength is required, deny themselves all
liquors, even when they are ordinarily accustomed to their use.

Dr. Richardson made some interesting experiments to show the influence of
alcohol upon muscular contraction. He carefully weighted the hind leg
of a frog, and, by means of electricity, stimulating the muscle to
its utmost power of contraction, he found out how much the frog could
lift. Then administering alcohol, he discovered that the response of the
muscle to the electrical current became feebler and feebler, as the
narcotic began to take effect, until, at last, the animal could raise
less than half the amount it lifted by the natural contraction
when uninfluenced by alcohol.

EFFECT UPON THE WASTE OF THE BODY.--The tendency of alcohol is to cause a
formation of an unstable substance resembling fat, [Footnote: The molecular
deposits equalizing the waste of the system do not go on regularly under
the influence of alcohol; the tissues are not kept up to their standard;
and, in time, their composition is changed by a deposit of an amorphous
matter resembling fat. This is an unstable substance, and the functions
of animal life all retrograde.--HUBBARD, _The Opium Habit and Alcoholism_.]
and so the use of liquor for even a short time will increase the
weight. But a more marked influence is to check the ordinary
waste of the system, so that "the amount of carbonic acid exhaled from
the lungs may be reduced as much as thirty to fifty per cent."--HINTON.
The life process is one of incessant change. Its rapidity is essential to
vigor and strength.

When the functions are in full play, each organ is being constantly torn
down, and as constantly rebuilt with the materials furnished from our
food. Anything that checks this oxidation of the tissues, or hinders
the deposition of new matter, disturbs the vital functions. Both these
results are the inevitable effects of alcohol; for, since the blood
contains less oxygen and more carbonic acid, and the power of
assimilating the food is decreased, it follows that every process of waste
and repair must be correspondingly weakened. The person using liquor
consequently needs less bread and beef, and so alcohol seems to him
a food--a radical error, as we have shown.

ALCOHOL CREATES A PROGRESSIVE APPETITE FOR ITSELF.--When liquor is taken,
even in the most moderate quantity, it soon becomes necessary, and then
arises a craving demand for an increased amount to produce the original
effect. No food creates this constantly augmenting want. A cup of milk
drank at dinner does not lead one to go on, day by day, drinking more and
more milk, until to get milk becomes the one great longing of the
whole being. Yet this is the almost universal effect of alcohol. Hunger
is satisfied by any nutritious food: the dram-drinker's thirst demands
alcohol. The common experience of mankind teaches us the imminent peril
that attends the formation of this progressive poison habit. A single
glass taken as a tonic may lead to the drunkard's grave.

Worse than this, the alcoholic craving may be transmitted from father
to son, and young persons often find themselves cursed with a terrible
disease known as alcoholism--a keen, morbid appetite for liquor that
demands gratification at any cost--stamped upon their very being
through the reckless indulgence of this habit on the part of some one of
their ancestors. [Footnote: The American Medical Association, at their
meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota (1883), restated in a series of resolutions
their conviction, that "alcohol should be classed with other
powerful drugs; that when prescribed medically, it should be done
with conscientious caution and a sense of great responsibility;
that used as a beverage it is productive of a large amount of
physical and mental disease; that it _entails diseased and enfeebled
constitutions upon offspring_, and that it is the cause of a large
percentage of the crime and pauperism of our large cities and
country."]

THE LAW OF HEREDITY is, in this connection, well worth consideration. "The
world is beginning to perceive," says Francis Galton, "that the life of
each individual is, in some real sense, a continuation of the lives of his
ancestors." "Each of us is the footing up of a double column of figures
that goes back to the first pair." "We are omnibuses," remarks Holmes, "in
which all our ancestors ride." We inherit from our parents our features,
our physical vigor, our mental faculties, and even much of our moral
character. Often, when one generation is skipped, the qualities will
reappear in the following one. The virtues, as well as the vices, of our
forefathers, have added to, or subtracted from, the strength of
our brain and muscle.

The evil tendencies of our natures, which it is the struggle of our lives
to resist, constitute a part of our heirlooms from the past.
Our descendants, in turn, will have reason to bless us only if we hand
down to them a pure healthy physical, mental, and moral being.

"There is a marked tendency in nature to transmit all diseased conditions.

Thus, the children of consumptive parents are apt to be consumptives. But
of all agents, alcohol is the most potent in establishing a heredity that
exhibits itself in the destruction of mind and body. [Footnote: Nearly all
the diseases springing from indulgence in distilled and fermented
liquors are liable to become hereditary, and to descend to at least
three or four generations, unless starved out by uncompromising
abstinence.

But the distressing aspect of the heredity of alcohol is the transmitted
drink- crave. This is no dream of an enthusiast, but the result of a
natural law.
Men and women upon whom this dread inheritance has been forced are
everywhere around us, bravely struggling to lead a sober life.--DR.
NORMAN KERR.] Its malign influence was observed by the ancients long
before the production of whiskey or brandy, or other distilled
liquors, and when fermented liquors or wines only were known. Aristotle
says, 'Drunken women have children like unto themselves,' and Plutarch
remarks, 'One drunkard is the father of another.' The drunkard by inheritance
is a more helpless slave than his progenitor, and his children are more
helpless still, unless on the mother's side there is an untainted
blood.
For there is not only a propensity transmitted, but an actual disease of the
nervous system."--DR. WILLARD PARKER. [Footnote: The subject of alcohol
is continued in the chapter on the Nervous System.]
PRACTICAL QUESTIONS.

1. How do clothing and shelter economize food?

2. Is it well to take a long walk before breakfast?

3. Why is warm food easier to digest than cold?

4. Why is salt beef less nutritious than fresh? [Footnote: The French
Academicians found that flesh soaked in water so as to deprive it
of its mineral matter and juices, lost its nutritive value, and that
animals fed on it soon died. Indeed, for all purposes of nutrition, Liebig
said it was no better than stones, and the utmost torments of hunger were
hardly sufficient to induce them to continue the diet. There was plenty of
nutritive food, but there was no medium for its solution and
absorption, and hence it was useless.] 5. What should be the food of a
man recovering from a fever?

6. Is a cup of black coffee a healthful close to a hearty dinner?

7. Should iced water be used at a meal?

11. Why are warm biscuit and bread hard of digestion?

12. Should any stimulants be used in youth?

13. Why should bread be made spongy?

14. Which should remain longer in the mouth, bread or meat?

15. Why should cold water be used in making soup, and hot water in boiling
meat?

16. Name the injurious effects of overeating.

Yes, Sire, very fluently.' 'That is quite enough to drive a husband mad.'
After this pretty compliment the King went on; the retinue saluted me,
laughing; and, for my part, I remained for some moments motionless with
surprise and confusion."

At the time when the French alliance was proposed by the Duc de Choiseul
there was at Vienna a doctor named Gassner,--[Jean Joseph Gassner, a
pretender to miraculous powers.]--who had fled thither to seek an asylum
against the persecutions of his sovereign, one of the ecclesiastical
electors.  Gassner, gifted with an extraordinary warmth of imagination,
imagined that he received inspirations.  The Empress protected him, saw
him occasionally, rallied him on his visions, and, nevertheless, heard
them with a sort of interest.  "Tell me,"--said she to him one day,
"whether my Antoinette will be happy."  Gassner turned pale, and remained
silent.  Being still pressed by the Empress, and wishing to give a general
expression to the idea with which he seemed deeply occupied, "Madame," he
replied, "there are crosses for all shoulders."

Bourdeaux shews the most determined loyalty; but, alas! there are troops
of the line in the town, and in the fort of Blaye. Instead of sending
these troops away, and guarding the town by the national guards, they
content themselves with giving dinners to each other, and making
the drunken soldiers cry, "Vive le Roi!" In England, every thing is
done by a dinner; perhaps they are imitating the English: but dinners
will not do in this case; decided measures must be taken, or Bourdeaux
will fall, in spite of its loyalty, and the noise it makes. The journal
published here, of which I have secured most of the numbers, from Napoleon's
landing to this day, is full of enthusiastic addresses:--The general
commanding the troops to the national guards,--the national guards
to the troops,--the mayor to his constituents,--the constituents
to the mayor;--all this is well, but it will do nothing.

Although every thing is yet quiet, I am determined to hurry our departure,
for I do not think there is a doubt of the issue. Since I entered Bourdeaux,
I have always thought it would yield on the first attack.

_Thursday_, the 30th.--Things look very ill. The fort of Blaye has
hoisted the tri-coloured flag. Thank heaven our vessel passed it
to-day; we should otherwise probably have been fired upon. We go to
Poillac, where we are to embark by land, as a party of English, who
attempted to go by water, were stopt and made prisoners. The
town of Bourdeaux is in a dead calm; the sounds of loyalty have ceased,
and a mysterious silence reigns throughout the streets: I am sure
all is not well.

Suddenly after all this silence, there has been a most rapid transition
to sentiments of the most devoted loyalty. This has been occasioned by a
great entertainment given by the national guards to the troops
of the line; so that I am afraid that although these regular
soldiers of the regular army, when elated with wine, choose to be
devoted loyalists, their political sentiments may undergo many
different changes upon their return to sobriety.

At present, the shout of Vive le Roi, from the different troops of the line
and national guards which are patroling the streets, is loud and
reiterated. Napoleon has sent to-day his addresses and declarations to
Bourdeaux, but the couriers have been imprisoned, and the civil authorities
have sworn to continue faithful to their King.
This loyalty will be immediately put to the test, for Clausel is advancing
to the walls. The Dutchess d'Angouleme passed through the streets, and
visited the _casernes_ of the troops: Indeed her exertions are incessant.
To her addresses the people are enthusiastic in their replies, but the
troops continue, as I expected, sullen and silent; they answered, that
they would not forget their duty to her, as far as not injuring her. I
trust that she passed our hotel this evening for the last time, and that
she has left Bourdeaux for England. Every individual in this city, the
troops excepted, appears to hate and detest Napoleon as cordially as he
detests them. They expect immediate destruction if he takes the town.
Their commerce must be ruined; yet there is no exertion--nothing
but noise.

Vive le Roi is in every heart, but they are overawed by the troops; it costs
nothing. Subscriptions, however, for arming the militia, go on slowly.
They seem always to keep a sharp eye to their pockets, although, as far
as shouting and bellowing is required, they are willing to levy any
contribution on their lungs.

The French are indeed miserably poor, but they are also miserably avaricious.
There is nothing even approaching to national spirit; yet their prudence
sometimes gets the better even of their economy. One instance, which I
witnessed to-day, will shew the way in which a Frenchman acts in times
like these: I was in a shop when one of the noblesse entered, bearing a
subscription paper. He addressed the shopkeeper, saying, that he begged
for his subscription, as he knew he was a royalist. I never _subscribe_
my name in times like these, said the cautious Frenchman, but I
will give you some money. The gentleman entreated, urging, that respectable
_subscriptions_, more than money, were wanted; but all in vain. The shopkeeper
paid his ten shillings, saying, _he would always be the first to
support his King_.

I entered a bookseller's shop, and asked for the political writings of
the day. The man looked me cautiously in the face, and said he had none
of them. I happened to see one on the table, and asked him for it,
telling him that I was an Englishman, and wished to carry them with me;
he then bid me step in, and from hidden corners of the inner-shop, he
produced the whole mass of pamphlets.--All this denotes that a change is
immediately expected.

This last night has been passed as might be expected, owing to the circumstances
in which we were placed, in much agitation. Clausel is every moment advancing
up the town. Every thing is in confusion. The troops declare they will not
fire a shot. The national guards are wavering and undecided, and this
moment (five in the morning) our coachman has knocked at our door to
tell us that we cannot remain another moment safe in the town.

* * *
_Friday_, the 31st.--We set off accordingly at sunrise, before any one was
abroad in the street. Our coachman reported, that General Clausel had
reached the gates, and that the national guard had been beat off. We
have arrived, therefore, at the most critical moment, and may be
grateful that we have escaped.

The road between Bourdeaux and Poillac is very bad. Arrived at the inn at
half way, we met with the Marquis de Valsuzenai, prefect of the town, who
confirmed the bad news: We learnt from him, that at three in the morning
of the 30th, the town had capitulated without a shot having been fired.
Two men were killed by a mistake of the soldiers firing, upon their own
officers; a miserable resistance! But it could not be otherwise, as no
militia could long stand against regulars.

Still I expected tumults in the streets--rising among the inhabitants--weeping
and wailing. But no: the French are unlike any other nation, they have no
energy, no principle. Miserable people! We arrived at Poillac just as it
grew dark, and owing to the sullen insolence of our coachman, who was
a complete revolutionist, and to his hatred for the English, which evinced
itself the moment he found that Bourdeaux had capitulated, we found it
difficult to get any thing like accommodation. I am happy to add, that
this same fellow, meeting another party of English, and beginning to be
insolent, an Irish gentleman, with that prompt and decisive justice
which characterises his country, by one blow of his fist laid him speechless
upon the pavement.

Upon meeting the Prefect of Bourdeaux, between that town and the
little sea-port Poillac, in disguise, and hurrying to the shore,
he informed us that before leaving the city, he had fallen on his
knees before the Dutchess d'Angouleme, to persuade her to embark
for England, and had, after much entreaty, succeeded.

That before setting out himself, he had sent her post-horses, and
most anxiously expected her arrival, although he had doubts whether she
would be permitted to leave the town. As we pursued our route, we passed
the Chateau Margot. The Marquis, to whom it belonged, was watching
on the road with his young daughter; and the moment our carriage
came in sight, he rushed up in great agitation, and exclaiming, "Where
is the Dutchess? Why does she not come. She must be concealed at my house
to-night. There are troops stationed at a league's distance from this to
prevent her escape."

Then observing the fair complexion of one of the ladies of our party, he
cried out, "It is the Dutchess, it is my beloved Princess. Oh! why have you
no avant garde; you must not proceed." The poor old man was in a state
of extreme agitation, and his daughter weeping.

It was a few minutes before we could undeceive him, and his assurances that
we should be stopt by the troops on the road, afforded us no very
cheering prospect as we proceeded on our journey.

No troops, however, appeared, and we arrived safely at Poillac at seven
o'clock.

The Dutchess did not appear that night; but early next morning, we were
called to the window, by hearing a great bustle in the street. It was
occasioned by the arrival of this unfortunate Princess. She had three or
four carriages along with her, filled with her attendants, and was escorted
by a party of the national guards. Their entry into Poillac formed a very
mournful procession; she herself looked deadly pale, although seemingly
calm and collected. We saw many of the officers of the national guard
crowding round her with tears in their eyes. There was a little chapel close
to where we were lodged, and while the other ladies went down to the frigate
to prepare for the embarkation, we heard that the Dutchess herself had
gone to mass. After we imagined that the service would be nearly concluded,
two of the ladies of our party entered the chapel, and placed themselves
near to where they knew she would pass. As she came near them, observing
that they were English, and much affected, she held out her hand to
them; one of them said, "Oh, go to our England, you will be cherished
there." "Yes, yes," replied she, "I am now going to your country;" and when
they expressed a wish that this storm would be quickly over, and that
when she again returned to France it would be for lasting happiness.
The Dutchess replied with an expression which was almost cheerful,
"Indeed, I hope so." This was the last time that any of us saw
her. There was then in her expression a look of sweet and tranquil
suffering, which was irresistibly affecting.

* * *

We embarked, this morning, _Saturday_, the 1st, on board the William
Sibbald, after a night of troubles. Most fortunately for me, I had
not trusted entirely to the owner's word, and had provided three beds and
some provisions; for the captain told us, he could not provide ship room,
and neither mattress nor provision of any kind.----Here we are then, in
no very comfortable circumstances, yet thankful to escape from this
miserable country. There are others in much greater misery than
we.
The Count de Lynch, Mayor of Bourdeaux, his brother, and another relation,
the General commanding the national guard, and four or five French
fugitives, have been sent on board here, by the Consul and the
English Captain of the frigate; and they have neither clothes, nor
beds, nor victuals: they leave their fortunes and their families
behind them.

"Alas! what a prospect," one of them exclaimed to-day; "this is the third
fortune Bonaparte has lost to me." The unfortunate Dutchess d'Angouleme is
now safe on board the English frigate. On leaving Bourdeaux, the
Dutchess printed an address to the inhabitants, stating the reasons of
her leaving them, to prevent the town from becoming a scene of blood and
pillage. Alas! she knows not her own countrymen; they would not fight an
hour to save her life: yet it is not because they do not love her--she
is adored--the whole family are adored.

The good among the nation wish for peace, but the troops are for war,
and they are all-powerful. It is unjust to say that France ought to be
allowed to remain under Napoleon, as she has desired his return: the
army chiefly have desired it, and plotted it. They burn for pillage and
for revenge on the allies, who had humbled their pride.

If the allies are not prompt, he will again be master of his former
territory. Something might even yet be done at Bourdeaux by an English
army.

We are now in the mouth of the English channel, and in full hopes,
that as our stock, of water and of patience is almost exhausted, the Captain
will put us into the first English port. May God grant us soon the sight
of an English inn, and an English post-chaise, and in a day we shall
forget all our troubles.

END OF THE JOURNAL.

CHAPTER III.

STATE OP FRANCE UNDER NAPOLEON.

To trace, with accuracy, the effects of the revolution and of the military
despotism of Napoleon on the kingdom of France, it would be necessary to
attend to the following subjects:--the state of commerce--wealth
of the nation, and division of this wealth--the state of agriculture--the
condition of the towns and villages--of the noblesse and their
property--the condition of the lower ranks, namely, the merchants,
tradesmen, artificers, peasants, poor, and beggars--the state of
private and public manners--the dress of the people--their
amusements--the state of religion and morality--of criminal delinquency
and the administration of justice.

But to treat all these different subjects, and to diverge into the
necessary observations which they would naturally suggest, would form
of itself a voluminous work. In order, however, to judge fairly of the
state of France, and of the character of the people, we must select
and make observations on a few of the most material points. In my Journal,
which accompanies this, I have purposely said but little on the state of
the people and their character, as I intended to finish my travels before
I formed my opinion. I did not wish to be guilty of the same mistake with
another traveller, who, coming to an inn in which he had a bad egg for
breakfast, served by an ugly girl, immediately set down in his Journal,
"In this country, the eggs are all bad, and the women all ugly." My readers
are already aware of the opportunities I possessed of obtaining
information.

They are such as present themselves to almost every traveller in France;
and they will not therefore be surprised if my remarks are somewhat
common-place. They will recollect that our party disembarked at Dieppe,
and travelled from one coast to the other by Rouen, Paris, Lyons and
Aix. By travelling very slowly, never above 30 miles a-day, I had, perhaps
a better opportunity than common of seeing the country, and of conversing
with the inhabitants; and I have been more than commonly fortunate
in forming acquaintance with a number of very well informed men in
the town, which we selected as the place of our residence in the
winter: This was Aix, in Provence.

I have described it before in my Journal, and have only to add, that
the head court for four departments is held there; that there is a College
for the study of Law and Divinity, and that it is remarkable for possessing
a society of men better informed, and of more liberal education, than most
other towns in France.

The inhabitants of Provence have always been marked by excesses of
affection or disaffection. They do nothing in moderation; "Les têtes
chaudes de Provence," is an expression quite common in France. In the
commencement of the revolution, the bands of Provençals, chiefly
Marseillois, were the leaders in every outrage. And when the tyrant, Napoleon,
had fallen from his power, they were among the first to cry "Vivent les
Bourbons!"

They would have torn him to pieces on his way to Frejus, had he not
been at times disguised, and at other times well protected by the
troops and police in the villages through which he passed. It will then
easily be imagined that the English were received with open arms at Aix.
They heaped on us kindnesses of every description, and our only difficulty
was to limit our acquaintance. From among the most moderate and best
informed of our friends at Aix, I attempted to collect a few
traits and anecdotes of Napoleon, and with their assistance, I
shall, in the first instance, attempt giving a sketch of his
character.

It would be tedious, as well as unnecessary, to detail all the circumstances
of his life; for most of these are generally known. I shall therefore
only mention such as we are not generally acquainted with.

* * *
NAPOLEON was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, not, as is generally
supposed, in August 1769, but in February 1768.

He had a motive for thus falsifying even the date of his birth; he conceived
that it would assist his ambitious views, if he could prove that
he was born in a province of France, and it was not till 1769 that Corsica
became entitled to that denomination. His reputed father was not a
_huissier_ (or bailiff) as is generally stated, but a _greffier_ (or
register of one of the courts of justice). His mother is a Genoese; she
is a woman of very bad character; and it is currently reported that
Napoleon was the son of General Paoli; and that Louis and Jerome were
the sons of the Marquis de Marbeuf, governor of the island. The conduct
of the Marquis to the family of Bonaparte, then in the utmost
indigence, would sanction a belief in this account; he protected
the whole family, but particularly the sons, and he caused Napoleon
to be placed at the Military School of Brienne, where he supplied
him with money.

This money was never spent among his companions, but went to purchase
mathematical books and instruments, and to assist him in erecting
fortifications. The only times when he deigned to amuse himself with
others was during the attacks of these fortifications, and immediately on
these being finished, he would retire and shut himself up among his
books and mathematical instruments. He was, when a boy, always morose,
tyrannical and domineering. "[11]Il motrait dans ces jeux cet esprit de
domination qu'il a depuis manifestée sur le grand theatre du monde; et
celui qui devoit un jour epouvanter l'Europe a commencè par etre le
maitre et l'effroi d'une troupe d'enfans[12]."

He left the military college with the rank of lieutenant of artillery, and
bearing a character which was not likely to recommend him among good men.
He had very early displayed principles of a most daring nature. In
a conversation with the master of the academy, some discussion
having taken place on the subject of the difficulty of governing a great
nation, the young Corsican remarked, "that the greatest nations were as
easily managed as a school of boys, but that kings always studied
to make themselves beloved, and thus worked their own ruin."

The infant despot of France was certainly determined that no such foolish
humanity should dictate rules to his ambition. He was once in a private
company, where a lady making some remarks on the character of Marshal
Turenne, declared that she would have loved him had he not burned the
Palatinate.
"And of what consequence was that, Madame," said the young Napoleon,
"provided it assisted his plans?" We may here trace the same unfeeling
heart that ordered the explosion of the magazine of Grenelle, which, if his
orders had been executed, must have laid Paris in ruins.

Some of my readers may, perhaps, not have seen an authentic statement of
this most horrid circumstance, I shall therefore give a translation of
the letter of Maillard Lescourt, major of artillery, taken from the
Journal des Debats of the 7th April: "I was employed, on the evening
before the attack of Paris, in assembling the horses necessary for
the removal of the artillery, and was assisted in this duty by the
officers of the 'Direction Generale.'

At nine at night a colonel gallopped up to the gate of the grating of
St Dominique, where I was standing, and asked to speak to the Directeur
d'Artillerie. On my being shewn to him, he immediately asked me if
the powder magazine at Grenelle bad been evacuated? I replied that it had
not, and that there was neither time nor horses for the purpose. Then,
Sir, said he, it must be blown up.

I turned pale, and trembled, not reflecting that there was no occasion
to distress myself for an order which was not written, and with the
bearer of which I was unacquainted. Do you hesitate? said the Colonel.--It
immediately occurred to me, that the same order might be given to
others, if I did not accept of it; I therefore calmly replied to him, that
I should immediately set about it. Become master of this frightful secret,
I entrusted it to no one."

At Paris we met with persons of much respectability, who vouched for the
truth of this statement.

There can be no doubt that this order was given by Napoleon, for at
this time the other ruling authorities had left Paris. It is by no means
inconsistent with the character of the man; never, in any instance, has
he been known to value the lives of men, where either ambition or revenge
instigated him. Beauchamp, in his history of the last campaign,
gives the following anecdote;[13] "Sire, (lui disoit un general, en le
felicitant sur la victoire de Montmirail), quel beau jour, si nous ne
voyions autour de nous tant de villes et de pays devastès.
'Barbarians like us,' observed the Emperor,
'would say la connetable and le connetable.'

"The Czar inquired into the most minute particulars respecting the
establishment of Ecouen, and I felt great pleasure in answering his
questions.  I recollect having dwelt on several points which appeared to
me to be very important, and which were in their spirit hostile to
aristocratic principles.  For example, I informed his Majesty that the
daughters of distinguished and wealthy individuals and those of the humble
and obscure mingled indiscriminately in the establishment.  'If,' said I,
'I were to observe the least pretension on account of the rank or fortune
of parents, I should immediately put an end to it.  The most perfect
equality is preserved; distinction is awarded only to merit and industry.
The pupils are obliged to cut out and make all their own clothes.  They
are taught to clean and mend lace; and two at a time, they by turns, three
times a week, cook and distribute food to the poor of the village.  The
young girls who have been brought up at Ecouen, or in my boarding-school
at St. Germain, are thoroughly acquainted with everything relating to
household business, and they are grateful to me for having made that a
part of their education.  In my conversations with them I have always
taught them that on domestic management depends the preservation or
dissipation of their fortunes.'

"The post-master of Ecouen was in the courtyard at the moment when the
Emperor, as he stepped into his carriage, told me he would send some
sweetmeats for the pupils.  I immediately communicated to them the
intelligence, which was joyfully received; but the sweetmeats were looked
for in vain.  No father and mother can endure to see a daughter suffering
the pain of separation from her husband.

KING. Oh! my dear Má[T.]Havya,
Was it a dream? or did some magic dire, Dulling my senses with a strange
delusion, O'ercome my spirit? or did destiny, Jealous of my good
actions, mar their fruit, And rob me of their guerdon?

It is past, Whate'er the spell that bound me. Once again Am I awake,
but only to behold The precipice o'er which my hopes have
fallen.

MODIFICATIONS OF THE BREATH.--_Sighing_ is merely a prolonged inspiration
followed by an audible expiration. _Coughing_ is a violent expiration in
which the air is driven through the mouth.
_Sneezing_ differs from coughing, the air being forced through the nose.
_Snoring_ is produced by the passage of the breath through the pharynx
when the tongue and soft palate are in certain positions.
[Footnote: The soft palate must have fallen back in such a manner as
nearly or quite to close the entrance to the nasal cavity from the throat,
and the tongue must also be thrown back so far as to leave only a narrow
opening between it and the soft palate. The noise is produced by the air
being forced either inward or outward through this opening. A snore results
also when, with a closed mouth, the air is forced between the soft palate
and the back wall of the pharynx into the nasal cavity. With deep breathing,
perhaps accompanied by a variation in the position of the soft
palate, a rattling noise may be heard in addition to the snoring,
which is due to a vibration of the soft palate.

--F. A. FERNALD, in "How we Sneeze, Laugh, Stammer, and Sigh."--_Popular
Science Monthly_, Feb., 1884.] _Laughing_ and _crying_ are very much alike.
The expression of the face is necessary to distinguish between them. The
sounds are produced by short, rapid contractions of the diaphragm.
_Hiccough_ is confined to inspiration. It is caused by a contraction of
the diaphragm and a constriction of the glottis; the current of
air just entering, as it strikes the closed glottis, gives rise to
the well-known sound.

_Yawning_, or _gaping_, is like sighing. [Footnote: The usefulness of a yawn
lies in bringing up the arrears, as it were, of respiration, when it has
fallen behindhand, either through fatigue or close attention to
other occupation. The stretching of the jaws and limbs may also serve to
equalize the nervous influence, certain muscles having become uneasy
on account of being stretched or contracted for a long time.] It
is distinguished by a wide opening of the mouth and a deep, profound
inspiration. Both processes furnish additional air, and therefore
probably meet a demand of the system for more oxygen. Frequently,
however, they are like laughing, sobbing, etc., merely a sort of
contagion, which runs through an audience, and seems almost irresistible.

THE CAPACITY OF THE LUNGS.--If we take a deep inspiration, and then
forcibly exhale all the air we can expel from the lungs, this
amount, which is termed the _breathing capacity_, will bear a very
close correspondence to our stature.

For a man of medium height (five feet eight inches) it will be about two
hundred and thirty cubic inches, [Footnote:
Of this amount, one hundred cubic inches can be forced in only by an extra
effort, and is available for emergencies, or for purposes of training,
as in singing, climbing, etc. It is of great importance, since, if the
capacity of the lungs only equaled our daily wants, the least obstruction
would prove fatal.] or a gallon, and for each inch of height between
five and six feet there will be an increase of eight cubic inches. In
addition, it is found that the lungs contain about one hundred cubic
inches which can not be expelled, thus making their entire contents
about three hundred and thirty cubic inches, or eleven pints.

The extra amount always on hand in the lungs is of great value, since thereby
the action of the air goes on continuously, even during a violent
expiration.

In ordinary breathing, only about twenty or thirty cubic inches (less than
a pint) of air pass in and out.

and.
drink; but none of these wants is so pressing as that for air.Mantes is a cheerful place of residence, and the idea of an abode there

In Calcutta, this season continues for about three months; in Upper
India, for about five; and in the Panjáb for about seven.

The rains in Bengal Proper are more violent and protracted
than in Hindústán and the Panjáb. In the latter
country they last for hardly more than two months, and
even then only fall at intervals. Plays were acted on solemn and
festive occasions, on lunar holidays, and especially at the
changes of the season.
