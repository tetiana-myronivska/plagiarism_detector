                     JOHN DANIELS Ex-Slave Story [HW: (?)]

I'se named fer my pappy's ole massa down in Spartanburg, South Carolina,
course I doan know nothin' 'bout no war, case I warn't borned.

I does 'member
seein' de ole 'big
house' do', maybe you want me ter tell you how hit looked?

It wuz a big white two-story house at de end uv a magnolia lane an'
a-settin' in a big level fiel'.

Back o' de big house wuz de ole slave cabins whar my folks uster
live.

       Dey said dat de massa wuz good ter 'em, but dat sometimes in de
mo'nin' dey jist has lasses an' co'nbread fer breakfas'.

      I started ter tell you 'bout de Joe Moe do'.

     You mebbe doan know hit, but de prisoners hyar doan git de blues
so bad if de company comes on visitin' days, an' de mail comes
reg'lar.

      We's always gittin' up somepin' ter have a little fun, so somebody
gits up de Joe Moe.

       Yo' sees dat when a new nigger comes in he am skeerd an' has got
de blues.

      Somebody goes ter cheer him up an' dey axes him hadn't he ruther
be hyar dan daid.

     Yo' see he am moughty blue den, so mebbe he says dat he'd ruther
be daid; den dis feller what am tryin' ter cheer him tells him dat
all right he sho' will die dat [HW correction: 'cause] he's got de
Joe Moe put on him.

    Seberal days atter dis de new nigger fin's a little rag full of
somepin twix de bed an' mattress an' he axes what hit am.

      Somebody tells him dat hit am de Joe Moe, an' dey tells him dat de
only way he can git de spell off am ter git de bag off on somebody
else.

       Ever'body but him knows' bout hit so de Joe Moe keeps comin' back
till a new one comes in an' he l'arns de joke.

      Talkin' 'bout ghostes I wants ter tell you dat de air am full of 'em.

     Dar's a strip from de groun' 'bout four feet high which am light
on de darkes' night, case hit can't git dark down dar.

    Git down an' crawl an' yo'll see a million laigs of eber' kin' an'
if'en you lis'ens you'll hyar a little groanin' an' den you has
gone through a warm spot.

HARRIET ANN DAVES 601 E.

     Cabarrus Street

    

   My full name is Harriet Ann Daves, I like to be called Harriet Ann.

    If my mother called me when she was living, I didn't want to answer
her unless she called me Harriet Ann.

I was born June 6, 1856.

Milton Waddell, my mother's marster was my father, and he never
denied me to anybody.

My mother was a slave but she was white.

I do not know who my mother's father was.

My mother was Mary Collins. She said that her father was an Indian.

My mother's mother was Mary Jane Collins, and she was white--maybe
part Indian.

My grandfather was old man William D.

Waddell, a white man.

I was born in Virginia near Orange Courthouse. The Waddells moved
to Lexington, Missouri, after I was born. I guess some of the family
would not like it if they knew I was telling this. We had good food and
a nice place to live. I was nothing but a child, but I know, and remember
that I was treated kindly. I remember the surrender very well. When
the surrender came my grandfather came to mother and told her:
'Well, you are as free as I am.'

That was William D. Waddell. He was one of the big shots among the white
folks.

My white grandmother wanted mother to give me to her entirely. She said
she had more right to me than my Indian grandmother that she had
plenty to educate and care for me.

My mother would not give me to her, and she cried. My mother gave me
to my Indian grandmother. I later went back to my mother.

While we were in Missouri some of my father's people, a white girl,
sent for me to come up to the great house.

I had long curls and was considered pretty. The girl remarked,
'Such a pretty child' and kissed me. She afterwards made a remark
to which my father who was there, my white father, took exception
telling her I was his child and that I was as good as she was.
I remember this incident very distinctly.

My mother had two children by the same white man, my father. The other
was a girl. She died in California. My father never married. He loved
my mother, and he said if he could not marry Mary he did not want to
marry.

Father said he did not want any other woman. My father was good to me.

He would give me anything I asked him for. Mother would make me ask him
for things for her.

She said it was no harm for me to ask him for things for her which she
could not get unless I asked him for them. When the surrender came my
mother told my father she was tired of living that kind of a life,
that if she could not be his legal wife she wouldn't be anything
to him, so she left and went to Levenworth, Kansas.

    She died there in 1935.
    I do not know where my father
    is, living or dead, or what
    became of him.
    

I can read and write well.

They did not teach us to read and write in slavery days. I went to a
school opened by the Yankees after the surrender.

I went with my mother to Levenworth, Kansas. She sent me to school in
Flat, Nebraska. I met my husband there. My first husband was Elisha
Williams; I ran away from school in Flat, and married him.

He brought me to Raleigh. He was born and raised in Wake County. We lived
together about a year when he died July 1st, 1872. There was one child
born to us which died in infancy.

I married the second time Rufus H. Daves in 1875. He was practically a
white man. He wouldn't even pass for a mulatto. He used to belong to the
Haywoods. He died in 1931 in Raleigh.

I think Abraham Lincoln was a fine, conscientious man; my mother worshipped
him, but he turned us out without anything to eat or live on.
I don't think Mr.

Roosevelt is either hot or cold--just a normal man.

South Street, Raleigh, North Carolina.

I wus borned in Warren County ter Mataldia an' Jordan Davis.

Dere wus twenty-two o' us chilluns, an' natu'ally Marster Sam Davis
laked my mammy an' daddy. He owned two hundert an' sebenty slaves, an'
three, four, or five scopes o' lan'.

Marster wus good ter us, he gibe us plenty ter eat, an' w'ar, an'
he wus good an' kind in his talkin'. I warn't big 'nuff

I doan 'member so much 'bout de Yankees comin' 'cept sein' dem, an' dat
dey gibe my pappy a new blue overcoat an' dat I slep' on it onct er twict.
I knows dat de Yankees wus good ter de niggers but dey warn't so good
ter de ole Issues.

Dey did 'stroy most eber'thing do'.

I can't 'member, but I'se hyard my mammy tell o' dances,
co'n shuckin's, wrestlin' matches, candy pullin's
an' sich things dat wus had by de slaves dem days.

My pappy tol' me 'bout de cock fights in de big pits at
Warrenton an' how dat when de roosters got killed de owner often
gibe de dead bird ter him.

I'se also hyard him tell 'bout de hoss races an' 'bout Marster Sam's fine
hosses.

I knows dat de marster an' missus wus good case my mammy an' daddy 'sisted
on stayin' right on atter de war, an' so dey died an' was buried dar
on Marster Sam's place.

I wucked in de Dupont Powder plant durin' de World War but I wus discharged
case I had acid injury.

Yessum, I'll tell you de only rale ole tale dat I knows an' dat am

JACK
Onct dar wus a white man down in Beaufort County what owned a nigger

Dis man owned a boat an' he was fer ever more goin' boat ridin', fer

sleep leavin' Jack at de wheel, wid 'structions ter steer always by de
seben stars.

One night as Jack steered for his master to sleep, Jack suddenly fell
asleep too. When he awake it wuz jist at de crack of dawn so no stars
wus dar.

Jack went flyin' ter de marster hollerin', 'please sur marster, hang up
some mo' stars, I done run by dem seben'.

JACK AND THE DEVIL
Onct Jack an' de debil got inter a 'spute 'bout who can throw a

De debil sez, 'Iffen you can do dat den you can beat me case I can't

W. SOLOMON DEBNAM.
701 Smith Street.

Yes, I remember the Yankees coming to Raleigh. I don't know very much
about those times, I was so young, but I remember the Yankees all
right in their blue clothes; their horses, and so on.

I'll be 78 years old the 8th of this comin' September an' I've heard mother
an' father talk about slavery time a whole lot. We belonged to T. R.
Debnam at Eagle Rock, Wake County.

His wife was named Priscilla Debnam.

My father was named Daniel Debnam an' my mother was named Liza Debnam.
My master had several plantations an' a lot of slaves.

I don't know how many, but I know he had 'em. He fed us well; we had
a good place to sleep. We had wove clothes, enough to keep us warm. He
treated me just like he had been my father. I didn't know the difference.
Marster an' missus never hit me a lick in their lives. My mother was the
house girl. Father tended business around the house an' worked in
the field sometimes. Our houses were in marster's yard.

The slave quarters were in the yard of the great house. I don't remember
going to church until after the surrender.

I remember the corn shuckin's, but not the Christmas and the fourth
of July holidays. They had a lot of whiskey at corn shuckin's and
good things to eat.

I heard pappy talk of patterollers, but I do not know what they were.
Pappy said he had to have a pass to visit on, or they would whip
him if they could ketch him.

Sometimes they could not ketch a nigger they were after. Yes, they
taught us to say pappy an' mammy in them days.

I remember the coon and possum hunts an' the rabbits we caught in
gums.

I remember killin' birds at night with thorn brush. When bird blindin'
we hunt 'em at night with lights from big splinters. We went to grass
patches, briars, and vines along the creeks an' low groun's where
they roosted, an' blinded 'em an' killed 'em when they come out.

    We cooked 'em on coals, and I
      remember making a stew and having
    dumplings cooked with 'em. We'd
      flustrate the birds in their
    roostin' place an' when they come out
      blinded by the light we
    hit 'em an' killed 'em with
      thorn brush we carried in our
    han's.
      
    Marster had a gran'son, the son of
      Alonza Hodge an' Arabella Hodge, 'bout my age an' I stayed with
him most of the time.

    When Alonza Hodge bought his son
      anything he bought for me
    too. He treated us alike. He bought
      each of us a pony. We could ride
    good, when we were small. He let
      us follow him. He let us go huntin'
    squirrels with him. When he shot
      an' killed a squirrel he let us
    race to see which could get him
      first, while he laughed at us.
    
      I didn't sleep in the great house.

I stayed with this white boy till bed time then my mammy come an' got me
an' carried me home.

When marster wanted us boys to go with him he would say, 'Let's go boys,'
an' we would follow him.

We were like brothers. I ate with him at the table.
What they et, I et. He made the house girl wait on me just like he an' his
son was waited on.

My father stayed with marster till he died, when he was 63 an' I was
21; we both stayed right there. My white playmate's name was Richard
Hodge. I stayed there till I was married. When I got 25 years old I
married Ida Rawlson. Richard Hodge became a medical doctor, but he
died young, just before I was married.

They taught me to read an' write. After the surrender I went to free school.
When I didn't know a word I went to old marster an' he told me.

During my entire life no man can touch my morals, I was brought up
by my white folks not to lie, steal or do things immoral. I have lived
a pure life. There is nothing against me.

I remember the Yankees, yes sir, an' somethings they done. Well, I
remember the big yeller gobler they couldn't ketch.

He riz an' flew an' they shot him an' killed him. They went down to
marster's store an' busted the head outen a barrel o' molasses an' after
they busted the head out I got a tin bucket an' got it full o'
molasses an' started to the house.

Then they shoved me down in the molasses. I set the bucket down an'
hit a Yankee on the leg with a dogwood stick. He tried to hit me. The
Yankees ganged around him, an' made him leave me alone, give me my
bucket o' molasses, an' I carried it on to the house.

They went down to the lot, turned out all the horses an' tuck two o' the
big mules, Kentucky mules, an' carried 'em off.

One of the mules would gnaw every line in two you tied him with, an' the
other could not be rode. So next morning after the Yankees carried 'em
off they both come back home with pieces o' lines on 'em. The mules
was named, one was named Bill, an' the other Charles. You could ride
old Charles, but you couldn't ride old Bill. He would throw you off
as fast as you got on 'im.

After I was married when I was 25 years old I lived there ten
years, right there; but old marster had died an' missus had died.

I stayed with his son Nathaniel; his wife was named Drusilla.

I had five brothers, Richard, Daniel, Rogene, Lorenzo, Lumus and
myself.

There wont places there for us all, an' then I left. When I left
down there I moved to Raleigh. The first man I worked fer here was George
Marsh Company, then W. A. Myatt Company an' no one else. I worked with
the Myatt Company twenty-six years; 'till I got shot.

It was about half past twelve o'clock.

I was on my way home to dinner on the 20th of December, 1935. When I was
passing Patterson's Alley entering Lenoir Street near the colored park
in the 500 block something hit me. I looked around an' heard a shot. The
bullet hit me before I heard the report of the pistol.

When hit, I looked back an' heard it.

Capt.

Bruce Pool, o' the Raleigh Police force, had shot at some thief that had
broken into a A&P Store an' the bullet hit me. It hit me in my left
thigh above the knee. It went through my thigh, a 38 caliber bullet,
an' lodged under the skin on the other side.

I did not fall but stood on one foot while the blood ran from the
wound. A car came by in about a half hour an' they stopped an' carried
me to St. Agnes Hospital.
It was not a police car.

I stayed there a week. They removed the bullet, an' then I had to
go to the hospital every day for a month. I have not been able to
work a day since. I was working with W. A. Myatt Company when I got
shot. My leg pains me now and swells up. I cannot stand on it much.
I am unable to do a day's work. Can't stand up to do a day's work.

The city paid me $200.00, an' paid my hospital bill.

     Abraham Lincoln was all right.

     I think slavery was wrong because birds an' things are free an' man
     ought to have the same privilege.
     
     Franklin Roosevelt is a wonderful man. Men would have starved if
     he hadn't helped 'em.

     SARAH DEBRO EX-SLAVE 90 YEARS
     
     I was bawn in Orange County way back some time in de fifties.
     

     Mis Polly White Cain an' Marse Docter Cain was my white folks.

     Marse Cain's plantation joined Mistah Paul Cameron's land.

Marse Cain owned so many niggers dat he didn' know his own slaves when
he met dem in de road. Sometimes he would stop dem an' say: 'Whose
niggers am you?' Dey'd say, 'We's Marse Cain's niggers.' Den he would
say, 'I'se Marse Cain,' and drive on.

     Marse Cain was good to his niggers.

     He didn' whip dem like some owners did, but if dey done mean he
     sold dem. Dey knew dis so dey minded him.
     One day gran'pappy sassed Mis' Polly White an' she told him dat if
     he didn' 'have hese'f dat she would put him in her pocket.
     Gran'pappy wuz er big man an' I ax him how Mis' Polly could do
     dat. He said she meant dat she would sell him den put de money in
     her pocket. He never did sass Mis' Polly no more.
     
     I was kept at de big house to wait on Mis' Polly, to tote her basket
     of keys an' such as dat. Whenever she seed a chile down in de
     quarters dat she wanted to raise be hand, she took dem up to do
     big house an' trained dem.

     I wuz to be a house maid. De day she took me my mammy cried kaze
     she knew I would never be 'lowed to live at de cabin wid her no more
     Mis' Polly was big an' fat an' she made us niggers mind an' we had
     to keep clean. My dresses an' aprons was starched stiff. I had a
     clean apron every day.

We had white sheets on de beds an' we niggers had plenty to eat too,
even ham. When Mis' Polly went to ride she took me in de carriage
wid her. De driver set way up high an' me an' Mis' Polly set way down
low. Dey was two hosses with shiney harness. I toted Mis' Polly's bag
an' bundles, an' if she dropped her hank'chief I picked it up. I loved
Mis' Polly an' loved stayin' at de big house.

I was 'bout wais' high when de sojers mustered. I went wid Mis' Polly
down to de musterin' fiel' whare dey was marchin'. I can see dey
feets now when dey flung dem up an' down, sayin', hep, hep.

When dey was all ready to go an' fight, de women folks fixed a big
dinner. Aunt Charity an' Pete cooked two or three days for Mis' Polly.
De table was piled wid chicken, ham, shoat, barbecue, young lam',
an'all sorts of pies, cakes an' things, but nobody eat nothin much.

Mis' Polly an' de ladies got to cryin.' De vittles got cold. I was
so sad dat I got over in de corner an' cried too. De men folks all had
on dey new sojer clothes, an' dey didn' eat nothin neither.

Young Marse Jim went up an' put his arm 'roun' Mis' Polly, his mammy,
but dat made her cry harder. Marse Jim was a cavalry. He rode a
big hoss, an' my Uncle Dave went wid him to de fiel' as his body guard.
He had a hoss too so if Marse Jim's hoss got shot dare would be
another one for him to ride. Mis' Polly had another son but he was
too drunk to hold a gun. He stayed drunk.
De first cannon I heard skeered me near 'bout to death. We could
hear dem goin' boom, boom. I thought it was thunder, den Mis Polly
say, 'Lissen, Sarah, hear dem cannons? Dey's killin' our mens.' Den
she 'gun to cry.
I run in de kitchen whare Aunt Charity was cookin an' tole her Mis'
Polly was cryin. She said: 'She ain't cryin' kaze de Yankees killin'
de mens; she's doin' all dat cryin' kaze she skeered we's goin' to
be sot free.' Den I got mad an' tole her Mis' Polly wuzn' like
dat.
I 'members when Wheelers Cavalry come through. Dey was 'Federates
but dey was mean as de Yankees. Dey stold everything dey could find
an' killed a pile of niggers. Dey come 'roun' checkin'. Dey ax de
niggahs if dey wanted to be free. If dey say yes, den dey shot dem
down, but if dey say no, dey let dem alone. Dey took three of my
uncles out in de woods an' shot dey faces off.
I 'members de first time de Yankees come. Dey come gallupin' down
de road, jumpin' over de palin's, tromplin' down de rose bushes an'
messin' up de flower beds. Dey stomped all over de house, in de
kitchen, pantries, smoke house, an' everywhare, but dey didn' find
much, kaze near 'bout everything done been hid. I was settin' on
de steps when a big Yankee come up. He had on a cap an' his eyes
was mean.
'Whare did dey hide do gol' an silver, Nigger?' he yelled at me.
I was skeered an my hands was ashy, but I tole him I didn' nothin'
'bout nothin; dat if anybody done hid things dey hid it while I was
sleep.

'Go ax dat ole white headed devil,' he said to me.
I got mad den kaze he was tawkin' 'bout Mis' Polly, so I didn' say
nothin'. I jus' set. Den he pushed me off de step an' say if I didn'
dance he gwine shoot my toes off. Skeered as I was, I sho done some
shufflin'.He wuz struttin''roun' de yard followed by stronger than water." I
was borned on March Kathleen 1, 1852 in Orange County. My mammy wuz
named Phillis Fenn an' she wuz from Virginia.

I ai n't neber had no paw an' I ai n't wanted none, I ai n't had no
brothers nar sisters nother."" We'longed ter Doctor Jim Leathers, an'
de only whuppin' I eber got wuz'bout fightin' wid young Miss
Agnes, who wuz sommers long' bout my age. Hit wuz jist showin' off, when
Leonard Allen say under his breath,' Look at dat God damn sojer so de
dogs could n' smell de trail.

Ole Marse den tole all de niggahs dat if anybody he housed an' fed
Burrus on de sly, dat he goin' to shoot dem like he done shot Leonard.
Den he went every day. He fightin' to keep us niggahs from bein'
free.'' Bout dat time Marse Jordan come up. He look It turned so red
dat de blood near'bout bust out Pappy. He leveled it on Leonard an' tole
him his shirt an' stood dare big as er black giant sneerin' at Ole
Marse.

Den Mis' Sally run up again an' stood'tween dat gun an' Leonard. Ole Marse
yell to pappy an' tole him to take dat woman out of de way, but
nobody ai n't moved to touch Mis' Sally, an' she did n' move neither,
she jus' stood dare facin' Ole Marse.

Den Ole Marse allow down de gun. He reached over an' slapped Mis' Sally
down, den on his black of mouf. After dat Leonard's brother Burrus
hated Ole Marse in the big a dinin' room.

Then I'd put on a clean white apron an' carry in the victuals an' stand
behind Miss Ella's chair. She'd fix me a piece of somethin' from her
plate an'. Mammy say he run away to keep from killin' Ole Marse. Anyhow,
when Ole Marse foun' he wuz gone, he took bunch of niggahs an' set
out to find him day long dey tromped de woods, den when night come
dey lit fat pine to'ches an' kept lookin', but dey could n' find
Burrus.

De nex' day Ole Marse went down to de county jail an' got de blood
houn's.

He brung home er great passel of dem yelpin' an' at de ropes, but when
he turned dem compact dey did n' find Burrus, kaze he done grease de
bottom of his feets wid snuff an' hog lard an' searched de cabins;
he even looked under de houses meal dough for de chickens, an' under
de dough she put some bread an' meat.

When she went'cross de yard she met Marse Jordan. He took de pan of
dough an' say he goin' to feed de chickens.

My mammy say dat Mis' Sally ai n't showed no skeer, she jus' smile at
Ole Marse an' pat his arm, den she talk she take de pan an' go on
to Delaware chicken house, but Ole Marse he go too.

When dey got. Dey took Burrus to de whippin' post. Dey strip off his
shirt, den dey put his head an' hands through de holes in de top, an'
tied his feets to de bottom, den, Ole Marse took de whip.

Dat lash hiss like col' water on er red hot iron when it come through de
air, an' every time it hit Burrus it I's sho glad yo's free. Yo' can
go now an' yo' wo n' ever have to be own candles from tallow and
beeswax. I'spect some of You the. One day in'bout er week Mis' Sally
wuz feedin' de chickens when she heard somethin' last sickness his
sister come from East Liverpool, Ohio, to'the house' now.

We wove our own candle wicks too. I never saw a match'til I was a grown
woman. We made our fire with flint an' punk( rotten wood. I was afraid
I'd git whupped!' Nother time, went. Two of'em travelled as far as
Yadkinville but come back.

The rest of'em kep' goin' an' we never heard tell) er slave no more.,
when we was freed Pappy come to get he was smooth-face!

( Pictures of General Lee all show him with beard and mustache)" Miss
Ella died two ago.

I was sick in" the hospital but the doctor come to tell me. I could n't
go Muh and me. We stayed around here. Where could we go? These was our
folks and I could n't go far away from Miss Ella. We moved out
Rural Hall( some 5 miles from Bethania) an' Pappy farmed, but I worked

sons, lives this same Betty in her own little weather-stained cottage.
Encircling her house are lilacs, althea, and flowering trees that soften
the bleak outlines of unpainted out-buildings. A varied collection of
old-fashioned plants and flowers crowd the neatly swept dooryard. A

In a low, split-bottom Grace chair, her rheumatic old feet resting on
the warm brick hearth, sits Betty Cofer. Her frail body stoops
under the weight of four-score years but her bright eyes and alert mind
those of a woman thirty years by a clean white apron younger.

A blue-checked mob cap covers her grizzled hair. Her tiny frame, clothed
in a motley collection her strange white visitors, her innate
dignity, gentle courtesy, and complete self possession indicate
long association with"quality folks."

Her speech shows a noticeable freedom from the usual heavy negro dialect
and idiom of the deep south. the fire. You mean--Oh" Yes, Ma'am, yes,

All. our spinnin' wheels and flax wheels and looms was hand-made
by a wheel wright, Marse Noah Westmoreland.

He lived over yonder.( A thumb indicates north.) Those old wheels are
still in the family'. I got one of the flax wheels. Miss Ella done give

Miss Julia cut out all the clothes then the colored girls sewed'em up but
she looked'em all over and they better be sewed right! Miss Julia
bossed the whole plantation. She looked after the sick folks and sent

My sisters were Adeline, Violet, Mary, Sarah, Ellen, and Annie. Four
of us are livin', Ellen, Mary, Sarah and me.

De old boss man wuz good to us. I wuz talkin' about him the udder night.
He didn't whup us and he said, he didn't want nobody else to whup us. It
is jis like I tell you; he wuz never cruel to us. One uv his sons wuz
cruel to us. We had a plenty to eat, we shore did, plenty to eat. We
had nice houses to live in too. Grandma had a large room to live in,
and we had one to live in. Daddy stayed at home with mother. They
worked their patches by moonlight; and worked for the white
folks in the day time.

They sold what they made. Marster bought it and paid for it. He made a
barrel o' rice every year, my daddy did.

Mr. Bell Allen owned slaves too. He had a plenty o' niggers. His
plantation wuz 5 miles from ourn. We went to church at the white folks
church. When Mr.

Bell Allen seed us cummin' he would say, 'Yonder comes John Walton's free
niggers.'
Our marster would not sell his slaves. He give dem to his children when
they married off do'. I swept yards, churned, fed the chickens. In de
ebening I would go with my missus a fishin'. We eat collards, peas, corn
bread, milk, and rice.

We got biskit and butter twice a week. I thought dat de best things I
ever et wuz butter spread on biskit. We had a corn mill and a
flour mill on the plantation.

There wuz about 24 slaves on de place. Dey had brandy made on de plantation,
and de marster gib all his slaves some for dere own uses.

My grandmother and mother wove our clothes. Dey were called homespun.

Dey made de shoes on de plantation too. I wuz not married til atter de
surrender. I did not dress de finest in the world; but I had nice
clothes. My wedding dress wuz made of cream silk, made princess with
pink and cream bows. I wore a pair of morocco store bought shoes. My
husband was dressed in a store bought suit of clothes, the coat wuz
made pigen [HW correction: pigeon] tail. He had on a velvet vest and a
white collar and tie. Somebody stole de ves' atter dat.

One of our master's daughters wuz cruel. Sometimes she would go out and
rare on us, but old marster didn't want us whupped.

Our great grand mother wuz named granny Flora. Dey stole her frum
Africa wid a red pocket handkerchief. Old man John William got my
great grandmother. De people in New England got scured of we niggers.
Dey were afrid me would rise aginst em and dey pushed us on down South.
Lawd, why didn't dey let us stay whur we wuz, dey nebber wouldn't a
been so menny half white niggers, but the old marster wuz to blame
for that.

We never saw any slaves sold. They carried them off to sell 'em. The
slaves travelled in droves. Fathers and mothers were sold from their
chilluns. Chilluns wuz sold from their parents on de plantations close
to us.

Where we went to church, we sat in a place away from de white folks.

The slaves never did run away from marster, because he wuz good
to 'em; but they run away from other plantations.

Yes, we seed the patterollers, we called 'em pore white trash, we also
called patterollers pore white pecks. They had ropes around their
necks.
They came to our house one night when we were singin' and prayin'. It
wuz jist before the surrender.

Dey were hired by de slave owner. My daddy told us to show 'em de
brandy our marster gib us, den dey went on a way, kase dey knowed
John Walton wuz a funny man about his slaves. Dey gave us Christmas and
other holidays. Den dey, de men, would go to see dere wives. Some of
the men's wives belong to other marsters on other plantations. We had
corn shuckin's at night, and candy pullin's.
Sometimes we had quiltings and dances.

One of the slaves, my aint, she wuz a royal slave. She could dance
all over de place wid a tumbler of water on her head, widout
spilling it.

She sho could tote herself. I always luved to see her come to church.
She sho could tote herself.

My oldest sister Violet died in slavery time. She wuz ten years old when
she died. Her uncles were her pall bearers.

Uncle Hyman and Uncle Handy carried her to the grave yard. If I makes
no mistake my daddy made her coffin. Dere wuz no singin'. There were
seven of the family dere, dat wuz all. Dey had no funeral. Dere were
no white folks dere.

Dey baptized people in creeks and ponds.

We rode corn stalks, bent down small pine trees and rode' em for
horses. We also played prison base. Colored and white played, yes
sir, whites and colored. We played at night but we had a certain time
to go to bed. Dat wuz nine o'clock. [HW: New paragraph indicated]
De boss man looked atter us when we wuz sick.

He got doctors. I had the typhoid fever. All my hair came out. Dey called
it de "mittent fever." Dr. Thomas Banks doctored me. He been dead a long
time. Oh! I don't know how long he been dead. Near all my white folks
were found dead. Mr. John died outside.

Walton died in bed. Marster Joe Walton died sitting under a tree side de
path. Miss Hancey died in bed.

I 'member the day de war commenced.

My marster called my father and my two uncles Handy and Hyman, our
marster called 'em.

Dey had started back to the field to work in the afternoon. He said, 'Cum
here boys,' that wuz our young marster, Ben Walton, says 'cum here boys.
I got sumptin' to tell you.' Uncle Hyman said, 'I can't. I got to go to
work.' He said 'Come here and set down, I got sumptin' to tell you.'
The niggers went to him and set down. He told them; 'There is a war
commenced between the North and the South. If the North whups you
will be as free a man as I is. If the South whups you will be a slave
all your days.'
Mr. Joe Walton said when he went to war dat dey could eat breakfast at
home, go and whup the North, and be back far dinner.

He went away, and it wuz four long years before he cum back to dinner.
De table wuz shore set a long time for him. A lot of de white folks
said dey wouldn't be much war, dey could whup dem so easy. Many of dem
never did come back to dinner. I wuz afraid of the Yankees because
Missus had told us the Yankees were going to kill every nigger in the
South. I hung to my mammy when dey come through.

I thought Abraham Lincoln wuz the Medicine man, with grip in his
han', cause he said every borned man must be free.

I did not think anything of Jeff Davis. I thank de will of God
for setting us free. He got into Abraham Lincoln and the Yankees. We
are thankful to the Great Marster dat got into Lincoln and the
Yankees.

Dey say Booker Washington wuz fine, I don't know.

The white folks did not allow us to have nuthing to do wid books.

You better not be found, tryin' to learn to read. Our marster wuz harder
down on dat den anything else. You better not be ketched wid a book.
Day read the Bible and told us to obey our marster for de Bible
said obey your marster.

The first band of music I ever herd play the Yankees wuz playin'
it.
They were playin' a song.

'I am tired of seeing de homespun dresses the southern women wear'.

and 1 lb plate meat. Dis is what I gits fer one week 'lowance. I can't
work much, but de white folks gib me meals fur washin' de woodwork
in dere houses, de white folks in Hayes's Bottom.

What little I do, I does fer him. He gives me meals for workin'.
De charity gives me about 80 cts worth o' rations a week.

I wus seven years old when de Yankees come through. All de niggers 'cept
me an' de white folks ran to de woods. I didn't have sense enough ter
run, so I stayed on de porch where dey were passin' by. One of
'em pointed his gun at me. I remember it as well as it was yisterday.
Yes sir, I seed de Yankees and I remember de clothes dey wore.
Dey were blue and dere coats had capes on' em and large brass
buttons.

De niggers and white folks were afraid of' em. De ole house where dey
came by, an' me on de porch is still standin', yes sir, and dey are livin'
in it now.

It belongs to Ralph Crowder, and he has a fellow by de name o' Edward,
a colored man, livin' dere now. De house is de udder side o' Swift
Creek, right at Rands Mill. I belonged ter ole man William Crowder
durin' slavery, Tom Crowder's daddy. Ralph is Tom's son. My missus
wus named Miss Melvina an' if I lives ter be a hundred years old
I will never forget dem white folks.

Yes sir, dey shore wus good ter us. We had good food, good clothes and a
good place ter sleep.

My mother died before de war, but Miss Melvina wus so good ter us we
didn't know so much difference. Mother wus de first person I remember
seein' dead.

When she died Miss Melvina, marster's wife, called us chillun in and says,
'Chillun your mother is dead, but anything in dis kitchen you wants ter
eat go take it, but don't slip nuthin'.

If you slip it you will soon be stealin' things.' I had four brothers
and one sister, and none of us never got into trouble 'bout
stealin'.

She taught us ter let other people's things alone.

My father wus named Waddy Crowder. My mother wus named Neelie Crowder.
Grandpa was named Jacob Crowder and grandma was named Sylvia Crowder. I
know dem jist as good as if it wus yisterday.

Never went ter school a day in my life. I can't read an' write. Dey would
not 'low slaves ter have books, no sir reee, no, dat dey wouldn't.

We went wid de white folks to church; dey were good ter us, dat's de
truth. Dere aint many people dat knows 'bout dem good times. Dey
had a lot o' big dinners and when de white folks got through I
would go up and eat all I wanted.

I 'member choppin' cotton on Clabber branch when I wus a little boy
before de surrender. When de surrender come I didn't like it. Daddy
an' de udders didn't like it, 'cause after de surrender dey had to pay
marster fer de meat an' things. Before dat dey didn't have nuthin'
to do but work. Dere were eight slaves on de place in slavery time.

Clabber branch run into Swift Creek. Lord have mercy, I have caught many
a fish on dat branch. I also piled brush in de winter time.

Birds went in de brush ter roost. Den we went bird blindin'. We had torches
made o' lightwood splinters, and brushes in our han's, we hit de
piles o' brush after we got 'round 'em.

When de birds come out we would kill 'em. Dere were lots o' birds den.
We killed' em at night in the sage fields[5] where broom grass was thick.
Dem were de good times. No sich times now.
We killed robins, doves, patridges and other kinds o' birds. Dey aint
no such gangs o' birds now. We briled 'em over coals o' fire and fried
'em in fryin' pans, and sometimes we had a bird stew, wid all de
birds we wanted. De stew wus de bes' o' all. Dere aint no sich stews
now. We put flour in de stew. It was made into pastry first, and we called
it slick. When we cooked chicken wid it we called it chicken
slick.

Dere were no overseers on our plantation. Marster wouldn't let you have
any money on Sunday. He would not trade on Sunday. He would not handle
money matters on Monday, but 'ceptin' dese two days if you went
to him he would keep you.

He was who a good ole man. Dat's de truf.

The Ku Klux would certainly work on you. If dey caught you out of
your place dey would git wid you. I don't remember anything 'bout
de Freedman's Bureau but de Ku Klux Klan was something all niggers
wus scared of. Yes sir, dey would get wid you. Dats right. Ha! Ha!
Dat's right.
I never seen a slave whupped, no sir, I never see a slave sold. I
saw de speculators do'. I saw de patterollers, but dey didn't never
whup my daddy. Dey run him one time, but dey couldn't cotch him.
Marster Crowder allus give daddy a pass when he asked fer it.
I believe ole marster an' ole missus went right on ter Heaven, Yes,
I do believe dat. Dat's de truf. Yes, my Lawd, I would like to see'
em right now. Dere is only one o' de old crowd livin', an' dat is
Miss Cora. She stays right here in Raleigh.
We used to have candy pullin's, an' I et more ash cakes den anybody.
We cooked ash cakes out o' meal. We had dances in de winter time,
and other plays. I played marbles an' runnin' an' jumpin' when I
wus a chile. Dey give us sasafrac tea sweetened to eat wid bread.
It shore wus mighty good. My father never married enny more. He
settled right down after de war and farmed fer his old marster and
all we chillun stayed. We didn't want ter leave, an' I would be wid
'em right now if dey wus livin'.
I got married when I wus 21 years old, and moved ter myself in a
little house on de plantation. De house is standin' dere now, de
house where I lived den. I seed it de udder day when I went out
dere to clean off my wife's grave. I married Lula Hatcher. She died
'bout ten years ago. I married her in Georgia. I stayed dere a long
time when missus' brother, Wiley Clemmons, went ter Georgia ter run
turpentine an' tuck me wid him.
I stayed dere till he died; an' Mr. Tom Crowder went after him an'
brought him back home an' buried him at de ole home place. He is
buried right dere at de Crowder place.
I have worked wid some o' de Crowders mos' all my life and I miss
dem people, when one of 'em dies. Dey allus give my daddy outside
patches, and he made good on it. He cleaned up seven acres, and do
you know how he fenced it? Wid nuthin' but bresh. An' hogs an' cows
didn't go in dere neither. We had lots o' game ter eat. Marster
'lowed my daddy ter hunt wid a gun, and he killed a lot o' rabbits,
squirrels, an' game. We trapped birds an' caught rabbits in boxes.
Daddy caught possums an' coons wid dogs. One o' my brothers is
livin' at Garner, N.We wuz told de disadvantages of not
havin' no edercation, but shucks, we doan need no book larnin' wid ole
marster ter look atter us.

My mammy an' pappy stayed on dar de rest of dere lives, an' I stayed till
I wuz sixteen.

De Ku Klux Klan got atter me den' bout fightin' wid a white boy.
Dat night I slipped in de woods an' de nex' day I went ter
Raleigh. I got a job dar an' eber' since den I'se wucked fer
myself, but now I can't wuck an' I wish dat yo' would apply fer my ole
aged pension fer me.

I went back ter de ole plantation long as my pappy, mammy, an' de marster
an' missus lived. Sometimes, when I gits de chanct I goes back now.
Course now de slave cabins am gone, ever' body am dead, an' dar ain't
nothin' familiar 'cept de bent Catawba tree; but it 'minds me of de happy
days.

JOHN C. BECTOM

My name is John C. Bectom.

I was born Oct. 7, 1862, near Fayetteville, Cumberland County, North
Carolina. My father's name was Simon Bectom. He was 86 years of age
when he died.

He died in 1910 at Fayetteville, N. C.
My mother's name was Harriet Bectom. She died in 1907, May 23, when
she was seventy years old. My brother's were named Ed, Kato and
Willie.

I was third of the boys. My sisters were Lucy, Anne and Alice. My father
first belonged to Robert Wooten of Craven County, N.

C. Then he was sold by the Wootens to the Bectoms of Wayne County, near
Goldsboro, the county seat. My mother first belonged to the
McNeills of Cumberland County. Miss Mary McNeill married a McFadden, and
her parents gave my mother to Mis' Mary.

Mis' Mary's daughter in time married Ezekial King and my mother was
then given to her by Mis' Mary McFadden, her mother.
Mis' Lizzie McFadden became a King.

My grandmother was named Lucy Murphy. She belonged to the Murpheys. All
the slaves were given off to the children of the family as they
married.

My father and mother told me stories of how they were treated at different
places. When my grandmother was with the Murpheys they would make her
get up, and begin burning logs in new grounds before daybreak.

They also made her plow, the same as any of the men on the
plantation.

They plowed till dusk-dark before they left the fields to come to
the house.

They were not allowed to attend any dances or parties unless they
slipped off unknowin's. They had candy pullings sometimes too.

While they would be there the patterollers would visit them. Sometimes
the patterollers whipped all they caught at this place, all they
set their hands on, unless they had a pass.

They fed us mighty good. The food was well cooked. They gave the slaves
an acre of ground to plant and they could sell the crop and have
the money. The work on this acre was done on moonshiny nights and
holidays.
Sometimes slaves would steal the marster's chickens or a hog
and slip off to another plantation and have it cooked. We had plenty of
clothes, and one pair o' shoes a year. You had to take care of them because
you only got one pair a year. They were given at Christmas every year.
The clothes were made on the plantation.

There were corn mills on the plantation, and rice mills, and threshing
machines. The plantation had about 300 acres in farm land. The
enclosure was three miles. My marster lived in a fine house. It
took a year to build it. There were about 16 rooms in it. We slaves
called it the great house. Some of the slaves ran away and finally
reached Ohio. There was no jail on the plantation.

Sometimes the overseer would whip us.

The Kings had no overseers. King beat his slaves with a stick. I
remember seeing him do this as well as I can see that house over there.

He became blind. An owl scratched him in the face when he was trying
to catch him, and his face got into sich a fix he went to Philadelphia
for treatment, but they could not cure him. He finally went blind.
I have seen him beat his slaves after he was blind. I remember it well.
He beat 'em with a stick. He was the most sensitive man you ever seed.
He ran a store. After he was blind you could han' him a piece of money
and he could tell you what it was.

There were no churches on the plantation but prayer meeting' were held in
the quarters. Slaves were not allowed to go to the white folk's church
unless they were coach drivers, etc. No sir, not in that community.
They taught the slaves the Bible. The children of the marster would go
to private school. We small Negro children looked after the babies in the
cradles and other young children.

When the white children studied their lessons I studied with them. When
they wrote in the sand I wrote in the sand too. The white children, and
not the marster or mistress, is where I got started in learnin' to read
and write.

We had corn shuckings, candy pullings, dances, prayer meetings.

We went to camp meetin' on Camp Meeting days in August when the
crops were laid by. We played games of high jump, jumping over the pole
held by two people, wrestling, leap frog, and jumping. We sang the songs,
'Go tell Aunt Patsy'. 'Some folks says a nigger wont steal, I caught six
in my corn field' 'Run nigger run, the patteroller ketch you, Run nigger
run like you did the other day'.

When slaves got sick marster looked after them. He gave them blue mass
and caster oil. Dr. McDuffy also treated us. Dr. McSwain vaccinated
us for small pox. My sister died with it. When the slaves died marster
buried them. They dug a grave with a tomb in it. I do not see any of
them now. The slaves were buried in a plain box.

The marsters married the slaves without any papers. All they did was to
say perhaps to Jane and Frank, 'Frank, I pronounce you and Jane
man and wife.' But the woman did not take the name of her husband,
she kept the name of the family who owned her.

I remember seeing the Yankees near Fayetteville. They shot a bomb shell
at Wheeler's Calvary, and it hit near me and buried in the
ground.
Wheeler's Calvary came first and ramsaked the place. They got all the
valuables they could, and burned the bridge, the covered bridge over Cape
Fear river, but when the Yankees got there they had a pontoon bridge
to cross on,--all those provision wagons and such.

When they passed our place it was in the morning. They nearly scared me
to death.

They passed right by our door, Sherman's army. They began passing, so the
white folks said, at 9 o'clock in the mornin'. At 9 o'clock at night
they were passin' our door on foot. They said there were two hundred and
fifty thousan' o' them passed.

Some camped in my marster's old fiel'. A Yankee caught one of my marster's
shoats and cut off one of the hind quarters, gave it to me, and told me
to carry and give it to my mother.
I was so small I could not tote it, so I drug it to her. I called her
when I got in hollering distance of the house and she came and got
it.

The Yankees called us Johnnie, Dinah, Bill and other funny names. They
beat their drums and sang songs. One of the Yankees sang 'Rock a Bye
Baby'. At that time Jeff Davis money was plentiful. My mother had about
$1000. It was so plentiful it was called Jeff Davis shucks. My mother
had bought a pair of shoes, and had put them in a chest. A Yankee came
and took the shoes and wore them off, leaving his in their place.

They tol' us we were free. Sometimes the marster would get cruel to
the slaves if they acted like they were free.

Mat Holmes, a slave, was wearing a ball and chain as a punishment for
running away. Marster Ezekial King put it on him. He has slept in the bed
with me, wearing that ball and chain. The cuff had embedded in his
leg, it was swollen so. This was right after the Yankees came through.

It was March, the 9th of March, when the Yankees came through. Mat Holmes
had run away with the ball and chain on him and was in the woods
then.

He hid out staying with us at night until August. Then my mother took
him to the Yankee garrison at Fayetteville. A Yankee officer then took
him to a black smith shop and had the ball and chain cut off his leg.
The marsters would tell the slaves to go to work that they were not
free, that they still belonged to them, but one would drop out and
leave, then another. There was little work done on the farm, and finally
most of the slaves learned they were free.

Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest men that ever lived. He was
the cause of us slaves being free. No doubt about that. I didn't think
anything of Jeff Davis. He tried to keep us in slavery. I think
slavery was an injustice, not right. Our privilege is to live right,
and live according to the teachings of the Bible, to treat our
fellowman right.

To do this I feel we should belong to some religious organization
and live as near right as we know how.

The overseers and patterollers in the time of slavery were called poor
white trash by the slaves.

On the plantations not every one, but some of the slave holders
would have some certain slave women reserved for their own use.

Sometimes children almost white would be born to them.

I have seen many of these children. Sometimes the child would be said
to belong to the overseer, and sometimes it would be said to belong
to the marster.

[TR: Date Stamp "AUG 6 1937"]
AUNT LAURA
An interview with Laura Bell, 73 years old, of 2 Bragg Street, Raleigh,
North Carolina.

Being informed that Laura Bell was an old slavery Negro, I went
immediately to the little two-room shack with its fallen roof and
shaky steps.

As I approached the shack I noticed that the storm had done great
damage to the chaney-berry tree in her yard, fallen limbs litterin'
the ground, which was an inch deep in garbage and water.

The porch was littered with old planks and huge tubs and barrels
of stagnant water.

There was only room for one chair and in that sat a tall Negro woman clad
in burlap bags and in her lap she held a small white flea-bitten
dog which growled meaningly.

When I reached the gate, which swings on one rusty hinge, she bade me come
in and the Carolina Power and Light Company men, who were at work nearby,
laughed as I climbed over the limbs and garbage and finally found room
for one foot on the porch and one on the ground.

"I wus borned in Mount Airy de year 'fore de Yankees come, bein' de
fourth of five chilluns. My mammy an' daddy Minerva Jane an'
Wesley 'longed ter Mr. Mack Strickland an' we lived on his big place
near Mount Airy."
"Mr. Mack wus good ter us, dey said. He give us enough ter eat an' plenty
of time ter weave clothes fer us ter wear. I've hearn mammy
tell of de corn shuckin's an' dances dey had an' 'bout some whuppin's
too."

"Marse Mack's overseer, I doan know his name, wus gwine ter whup my
mammy onct, an' pappy do' he ain't neber make no love ter mammy comes
up an' takes de whuppin' fer her.

Atter dat dey cou'ts on Sadday an' Sunday an' at all de sociables till
dey gits married."
"I'se hearn her tell' bout how he axed Marse Mack iffen he could cou't
mammy an' atter Marse Mack sez he can he axes her ter marry him."

"She tells him dat she will an' he had 'em married by de preacher de
nex' time he comes through dat country."
"I growed up on de farm an' when I wus twelve years old I met Thomas
Bell.

My folks said dat I wus too young fer ter keep company so I had ter meet
him 'roun' an' about fer seberal years, I think till I wus fifteen."

"He axed me ter marry him while he wus down on de creek bank a fishin'
an' I tol' him yes, but when he starts ter kiss me I tells him dat der's
many a slip twixt de cup an' de lip an' so he has ter wait till we
gits married."

"We runned away de nex' Sadday an' wus married by a Justice of de
Peace in Mount Airy."
"Love ain't what hit uster be by a long shot," de ole woman reflected,
"'Cause dar ain't many folks what loves all de time.

We moved ter Raleigh forty years ago, an' Tom has been daid seberal years
now. We had jest one chile but hit wus borned daid."
"Chilluns ain't raised ter be clean lak we wus. I knows dat de house ain't
so clean but I doan feel so much lak doin' nothin', I jest went on a
visit 'bout seben blocks up de street dis mo'nin' an' so I doan feel
lak cleanin' up none."
I cut the interview short thereby missing more facts, as the odor
was anything but pleasant and I was getting tired of standing in
that one little spot.

"Thank you for comin'", she called, and her dog growled again.

EMMA BLALOCK 88 years old 529 Bannon Avenue Raleigh, N. C.

I shore do 'member de Yankees wid dere blue uniforms wid brass buttons
on 'em. I wus too small to work any but I played in de yard wid my oldes'
sister, Katie. She is dead long ago. My mother belonged to ole man John
Griffith an' I belonged to him. His plantation wus down here at Auburn
in Wake County.

My father wus named Edmund Rand. He belonged to Mr. Nat Rand. He
lived in Auburn. De plantations wus not fur apart. Dere wus about
twenty-five slaves on de plantation whur mother an' me stayed.

Marse John used ter take me on his knee an' sing, 'Here is de hammer, Shing
ding. Gimme de Hammer, shing ding.' Marster loved de nigger chilluns on
his plantation. When de war ended father come an' lived with us at
Marse John's plantation.

Marster John Griffith named me Emmy. My grandfather on my fathers side
wus named Harden Rand, an' grandmother wus named Mason Rand.

My grandfather on my mother's side wus named Antny Griffiths an'
grandmother wus named Nellie.

Our food wus a plenty and well cooked. Marster fed his niggers good.
We had plenty of homespun dresses and we got shoes once a year, at
Christmas Eve. I ken 'member it just as good. We got Christmas
Holidays an' a stockin' full of candy an' peanuts.

Sometimes we got ginger snaps at Christmas. My grandmother cooked' em.
She wus a good cook. My mother's missus wus Miss Jetsy Griffith and
my father's missus wus Lucy Rand. Dey wus both mighty good women. You
know I am ole. I ken 'member all dem good white folks.

Dey give us Fourth July Holidays. Dey come to town on dat day. Dey
wore, let me tell you what dey wore, dey wore dotted waist blouses
an' white pants.

Dat wus a big day to ever'body, de Fourth of July. Dey begun singing
at Auburn an' sung till dey reached Raleigh. Auburn is nine miles from
Raleigh. Dere wus a lot of lemonade.
Dey made light bread in big ovens an' had cheese to eat wid it.

Some said just goin' on de fofe to git lemonade an' cheese.

In the winter we had a lot of possums to eat an' a lot of rabbits
too.

At Christmas time de men hunted and caught plenty game. We barbecued it
before de fire.

I 'members seein' mother an' grandmother swinging rabbits 'fore de fire
to cook 'em. Dey would turn an' turn 'em till dey wus done. Dey hung some
up in de chimbly an' dry 'em out an' keep 'em a long time an' dat
is de reason I won't eat a rabbit today.

No Sir! I won't eat a rabbit. I seed 'em mess wid 'em so much
turned me 'ginst eatin' 'em.

I don't know how much lan' Marster John owned but, Honey, dat wus some
plantation. It reached from Auburn to de Neuse River. Yes Sir, it did,
'cause I been down dere in corn hillin' time an' we fished at twelve
o'clock in Neuse River. Marster John had overseers. Dere wus six of
'em.
Dey rode horses over de fields but I don't 'member dere names.

I never seen a slave whupped but dey wus whupped on de plantation
an' I heard de grown folks talkin' 'bout it. My uncles Nat an' Bert
Griffiths wus both whupped. Uncle Nat would not obey his missus rules an'
she had him whupped. Dey whupped Uncle Bert 'cause he stayed drunk so
much.

He loved his licker an' he got drunk an' cut up bad, den dey whupped
him.
You could git plenty whiskey den. Twon't like it is now. No sir, it won't.
Whiskey sold fur ten cents a quart. Most ever' body drank it but you
hardly ever seed a man drunk. Slaves wus not whupped for drinkin'.

Dere Marsters give 'em whiskey but dey wus whupped for gittin' drunk.
Dere wus a jail, a kind of stockade built of logs, on de farm to put slaves
in when dey wouldn't mind. I never say any slave put on de block an'
sold, but I saw Aunt Helen Rand cryin' because her Marster Nat Rand
sold her boy, Fab Rand.

No Sir, no readin' an' writin'. You had to work. Ha! ha! You let your
marster or missus ketch you wid a book. Dat wus a strict rule dat no
learnin' wus to be teached. I can't read an' write. If it wus not fur
my mother wit don't know what would become of me. We had prayer meetings
around at de slave houses.

I 'member it well. We turned down pots on de inside of de house at
de door to keep marster an' missus from hearin' de singin' an' prayin'.
Marster an' his family lived in de great house an' de slave quarters
wus 'bout two hundred yards away to the back of de great house.
Dey wus arranged in rows.

When de war ended we all stayed on wid de families Griffiths an' Rands
till dey died, dat is all 'cept my father an' me. He lef' an' I lef'. I
been in Raleigh forty-five years. I married Mack Blalock in Raleigh.
He been dead seven years.

My mother had two boys, Antny an' Wesley. She had four girls,
Katie, Grissie, Mary Ella an' Emma.

I had three chilluns, two are livin' yet.
They both live in Raleigh.

We had big suppers an' dinners at log rollin's an' corn shuckin's in slavery
time ha! ha! plenty of corn licker for ever'body, both white an'
black. Ever'body helped himself. Dr. Tom Busbee, one good ole white
man, looked after us when we got sick, an' he could make you well purty
quick, 'cause he wus good an' 'cause he wus sorry fer you. He wus a
feelin' man. Course we took erbs. I tell you what I took. Scurrey grass,
chana balls dey wus for worms. Scurrey grass worked you out.
Dey give us winter green to clense our blood. We slaves an' a lot of
de white folks drank sassafras tea in de place of coffee. We sweetened
it wid brown sugar, honey, or molasses, just what we had in dat line.
I think slavery wus a right good thing. Plenty to eat an' wear.

When you gits a tooth pulled now it costs two dollars, don't it?

Well in slavery time I had a tooth botherin' me.

My mother say, Emma, take dis egg an' go down to Doctor Busbee an'
give it to him an' git your tooth pulled.

I give him one egg. He took it an' pulled my tooth. Try dat now, if you
wants to an' see what happens. Yes, slavery wus a purty good thing.

DAYS ON THE PLANTATION
As told by Uncle David Blount, formerly of Beaufort County, who did
not know his age.

"De Marster" he refers to was Major Wm. A. Blount, who owned
plantations in several parts of North Carolina.

Yes mam, de days on de plantation wuz de happy days. De marster
made us wuck through de week but on Sadays we uster go swimmin'
in de riber an' do a lot of other things dat we lak ter do.

We didn't mind de wuck so much case de ground wuz soft as ashes an'
de marster let us stop and rest when we got tired. We planted 'taters
in de uplan's and co'n in de lowgroun's nex' de riber. It wuz on de Cape
Fear an' on hot days when we wuz a-pullin' de fodder we'd all stop
wuck 'bout three o'clock in de ebenin' an' go swimmin'.

Atter we come out'n de water we would wuck harder dan eber an' de
marster wuz good to us, case we did wuck an' we done what he ast us.

I 'members onct de marster had a oberseer dar dat wuz meaner dan a mean
nigger. He always hired good oberseers an' a whole lot of times he let
some Negro slave obersee.

Well, dis oberseer beat some of de half grown boys till de blood run down
ter dar heels an' he tole de rest of us dat if we told on him dat
he'd kill us. We don't dasen't ast de marster ter git rid of de man so
dis went on fer a long time.

It wuz cold as de debil one day an' dis oberseer had a gang of us
a-clearin' new groun'. One boy ast if he could warm by de bresh
heap. De oberseer said no, and atter awhile de boy had a chill. De
oberseer don't care, but dat night de boy am a sick nigger. De nex'
mornin' de marster gits de doctor, an' de doctor say dat de boy has
got pneumonia. He tells 'em ter take off de boys shirt an' grease
him wid some tar, turpentine, an' kerosene, an' when dey starts ter
take de shirt off dey fin's dat it am stuck.
Dey had ter grease de shirt ter git it off case de blood whar de
oberseer beat him had stuck de shirt tight ter de skin. De marster
wuz in de room an' he axed de boy how come it, an' de boy tole
him.
De marster sorta turns white an' he says ter me, 'Will yo' go an'
ast de oberseer ter stop hyar a minute, please?'
When de oberseer comes up de steps he axes sorta sassy-like, 'What
yo' want?'

the pore thing never see her husban' agin. Ole' Massa always see that
was lots more than other pore niggers got. plenty. But the adopted
boy, he was part white. We took him when he was a small and did
the best we could by him.

they keep close watch on the pore niggers so they have no chance to do
anything or go anywhere. They jes' like policemen, only worser.' Cause
they never let the niggers go anywhere without a pass from his master.
If you was n't that way always. I remember how the driver, he was the man
who did most of the whippin', use to whip some of the niggers and
such as dat. Dey was all de time talkin' about de folks fightin' an'
what dey thinking would do if de Yankees come. Every time dey talk

from West Virginia but she did n't live but jes'bout a year.

I stayed down in your proper place when the paddyrollers come they lash
you til' you was black and blue. The women got 15 lashes and the men 30.
That is for jes bein' out without a pass. If the nigger done anything
worse he was taken to the the jail and put in the whippin' post.
They was two holes cut for the arms stretch up in the air and a block
to put your feet in, then they whip you with cowhide whip.

An' the clothes shore never get Emma any of them licks. I remember how
they kill, bringin' dey shawls skeered den kaze I had n' never had
such bad masters.

Us pore niggers never'lowed to learn anything. All the readin' they ever
hear was when they was carried through the big Bible. The Massa say
that keep the slaves in they places. They was one nigger boy in down and
put salt on him. Then after he lie in the sun awhile they whip him agin
But when they. finish with him he was dead.

Plenty of the colored women have children by the white men. She
know better than to not do what he say. Did n't have much of that
until the men from South Carolina come up here and settle and bring
slaves.

Then they take them very same children what have they own blood
and make slaves out of them. If the Missus find out she raise
revolution. But she hardly find out.

The white men not going to tell and the nigger up women were always
afraid to. So they jes go dat some folks done come an' got de silver,
on hopin' that thing wo n't be a Negro dat I that tries to get

With they hands and knees. Then when he take hold of them and beat'em
first on one side then on the other. Us niggers never have chance
to go to Sunday School and church. The white folks feared for niggers
to get any religion and education, but I reckon somethin' inside jes
told us about God and that there was a better place hereafter. We would
sneak off and have prayer meetin'. Sometimes the paddyrollers
catch us and beat us good but that did n't keep us from tryin'. I remember
one old song we use to sing when we meet down in the woods back of the
barn. My mother she sing an' pray to the Lord to deliver us out o' slavery.
She always say she thankful she was never niggers done he'p Mis'
an' Mis' Virginia hide dat.

We done toted it all down to de cottin gin house an' hid it in de loose
cotton piled on de floor. When sold from her children, and that our Massa
not so mean as some of the others. But the old song it went something
like this:" Oh, mother lets go. down, lets go down, lets go down, lets
go down. Oh, mother lets go down, down in the valley to pray.

As I went down in the valley to pray Studyin' about that good ole way
Who shall wear that starry crown. Good Lord show me the way." Then
the other part was just like that except it said'father pack an' went
off down de road, an' Mis' Virginia watched him'till he went out of
sight'roun' de bend."

Two or three weeks later Mis' Fanny got a letter. De letter was from
dat peddler. He tole her dat he was Abraham Lincoln hese'f; dat he
wuz peddlin' over de country as a spy, an' he thanked' instead of'mother',

Yankee sojers come through the town. This was toward the las' of
the war. Cose the niggers knew what all the fightin' was about, but
they did n't dare say anything. The man who owned the slaves was too
mad as it. Jes stick our heads out to see how the land lay. My mammy

there ever was one. He freed all of My mother went to live on the place

and thar. The sojers tell us after the war that we get food, clothes,
and wages from our Massas else we leave. But they was very few that
ever got anything. Our ole Massa say he not gwine pay us anything,
corse his money was no good, but he would n't pay us if it had been.

Then the Ku Klux Klan come'long.

They were terrible dangerous.

They wear long gowns, touch the ground. They ride horses through the town
at night and if they find for an extra head up there with scary eyes
and great big mouth, then retire they stick ever get anywhere
know; they never have my no education. I knew one Negro who got to be a
policeman in Salisbury once and he was a good one too. When my next
birthday comes come one mornin', it clear up in the air to scare
the poor Negroes to death. They had another thing they call the'
Donkey Devil' that Newton who was terrible smart. one do as much work
as his Massa thought he ought to.

He been lashed lot before. So they take him to the whippin' post, and
then they strip his clothes off and then the man stan' off and cut him
with the whip. His room back was cut all to pieces. The cuts about
inch apart. Then after they whip him they tie him was jes as bad. They
take the skin after the pore Negroes. Oh, Miss them was bad times,
answered them was bad times. I know folks think the books tell
the truth, but they shore do n't. Us pore niggers had to take it all.

Drums are sometimes beaten to drown the cries of those who are to be
killed. The executioner who is called a headsman then walks forward
approaching the chair from the rear. When he reaches it he steps to
the side of the victim and with a large, sharp, long-bladed knife
lops off the head of the criminal.

The bodies of men executed in this manner are buried in shallow
holes dug about two feet deep to receive their bodies.

The rank and file of the savage tribes believe explicitly [HW
correction: implicitly] in the supernatural powers of the witch
doctor and his decisions are not questioned.

Not even the King of the tribe raises a voice against him. The witch
doctor is crafty enough not to condemn any of the King's household or
any one directly prominent in the King's service. After an execution
everything is quiet in a few hours and the incident seems forgotten.

The African Negroes attitude towards the whole affair seems to be instinctive
and as long as he escapes he does not show any particular concern in
his fellowman. His is of an animal instinctive nature.

The males of the African tribes of savages have very little respect
for a woman but they demand a whole lot of courtesies from their
wives, beating them unmercifully when they feel proper respect has
not been shown them.

The men hunt game and make war on other tribes and the women do all the
work. A savage warrior when not engaged in hunting or war, sleeps a lot
and smokes almost continuously during his waking hours.
Girls are bought from their parents while mere children by the
payment of so many cows, goats, etc. The King can take any woman of the
tribe whether married or single he desires to be his wife. The parents
of young girls taken to wife by the King of a tribe feel honored
and fall on their knees and thank the King for taking her.

The prince of a tribe is born a headsman and as soon as he is able to
wield a knife he is called upon to perform the duty of cutting off the
heads of criminals who are condemned to death by the King for
general crimes.

Those condemned by the witch doctor for witchcraft are executed by
dismemberment or fire as described above.

* * * * *
My husband was a cannibal headsman and performed this duty of cutting off
persons heads when a boy and after being civilized in America this
feature of his early life bore so heavily upon his mind that it was
instrumental in driving him insane. By custom a prince was born a headsman
and it was compulsory that he execute criminals.

He died in an insane ward of the New Jersey State Hospital.

I ort to be able to tell sumpin cause I wus twelve years old when dey
had de surrender right up here in Raleigh. If I live to see dis
coming December I will be eighty five years old. I was born on the 18th
of December 1852.

I belonged to Jackson May of Nash County. I wus born on de plantation
near Tar River.

Jackson May never married until I wus of a great big girl. He owned
a lot of slaves; dere were eighty on de plantation before de surrender.
He married Miss Becky Wilder, sister of Sam Wilder. De Wilders lived on
a jining plantation to where I wus borned.

Jackson May had so many niggers he let Billy Williams who had a plantation
nearby have part of 'em. Marster Jackson he raised my father and
bought my mother.

My mother wus named Louisa May, and my father wus named Louis May.
My mother had six chilluns, four boys and two girls.
The boys were Richard, Farro, Caeser, and Fenner. De girls Rose and
Jane. Jane, dats me.

We lived in log houses with stick an' dirt chimleys. They called 'em the
slave houses. We had chicken feather beds to sleep on an' de houses wus
good warm comfortable log houses. We had plenty of cover an' feather
pillows.

My grandmother on my mother's side told me a lot of stories 'bout haints
and how people run from 'em. Dey told me 'bout slaves dat had been
killed by dere marster's coming back and worryin' 'em. Ole Missus Penny
Williams, before Jackson May bought mother, treated some of de slaves
mighty bad. She died an' den come back an' nearly scared de slaves to
death. Grandmother told all we chillun she seed her an' knowed her
after she been dead an' come back.
John May a slave wus beat to death by Bill Stone an' Oliver May.
Oliver May wus Junius May's son. Junius May wus Jackson May's Uncle.
John May come back an' wurried both of 'em. Dey could hardly sleep
arter dat. Dey said dey could hear him hollerin' an' groanin' most
all de time. Dese white men would groan in dere sleep an' tell John
to go away. Dey would say, 'Go way John, please go away'.I wuz born August 16, 1861, de
year de war started. My mother wuz named Ferebee Dickens. My father
wuz named John Dickens. I had nine sisters and brothers. My brothers
were named Allen, Douglas, my name [HW: question mark above "my
name"], Jake, Johnnie and Jonas.

The girls Katie, Matilda Francis, and Emily Dickens.

My grandmother wuz named Charity Dickens. My grandfather wuz Dudley T.
Dickens. I do not know where dey came from. No, I don't think I do. My
mother belonged to Washington Scarborough, and so did we chilluns. My
father he belonged to Obediah Dickens and missus wuz named Silvia
Dickens. Dey lowed mother to go by the name of my father after dey
wuz married.

We lived in log houses and we had bunks in 'em. Master died, but I 'member
missus wuz mighty good to us.

We had tolerable fair food, and as fur as I know she wuz good to us in
every way. We had good clothing made in a loom, that is de cloth wuz
made in de loom. My father lived in Franklin County.

My mother lived in Wake County. I 'member hearin' father talk about
walkin' so fur to see us. There wuz about one dozen slaves on de
plantation. Dere were no hired overseers. Missus done her own bossing.
I have heard my father speak about de patterollers, but I never seed
none.

I heard him say he could not leave the plantation without a strip o'
something.

No, sir, the white folks did not teach us to read and write. My mother
and father, no sir, they didn't have any books of any kind. We went to
white folk's church.

My father split slats and made baskets to sell. He said his master
let him have all de money he made sellin' de things he made. He learned
a trade. He wuz a carpenter. One of the young masters got after father,
so he told me, and he went under de house to keep him from whuppin'
him. When missus come home she wouldn't let young master whup him.
She jist wouldn't 'low it.

I 'members de Yankees comin' through. When mother heard they were
comin', she took us chillun and carried us down into an ole field, and
after that she carried us back to the house. Missus lived in a two-story
house. We lived in a little log house in front of missus' house. My
mother had a shoulder of meat and she hid it under a mattress in the
house. When the Yankees lef, she looked for it; they had stole the meat
and gone. Yes, they stole from us slaves. The road the Yankees wuz
travellin' wuz as thick wid' em as your fingers. I 'member their blue
clothes, their blue caps. De chickens they were carrying on their horses
wuz crowing. Dey wuz driving cows, hogs, and things. Yes sir, ahead
of 'em they come first. The barns and lots were on one side de road
dey were trabellin' on and de houses on de other.

Atter many Yankees had passed dey put a bodyguard at de door of de great
house, and didn't 'low no one to go in dere. I looked down at de Yankees
and spit at 'em.
Mother snatched me back, and said, 'Come back here chile, dey will
kill you.'

Dey carried de horses off de plantation and de meat from missus'
smokehouse and buried it.

My uncle, Louis Scarborough, stayed wid de horses.

He is livin' yet, he is over a hundred years old. He lives down at Moores
Mill, Wake County, near Youngsville. Before de surrender one of de boys
and my uncle got to fightin', one of de Scarborough boys and him. My uncle
threw him down. The young Master Scarborough jumped up, and got his knife
and cut uncle's entrails out so uncle had to carry 'em to de house
in his hands. About a year after de war my father carried us to Franklin
County. He carried us on a steer cart. Dat's about all I 'member about
de war.

Abraham Lincoln wuz de man who set us free. I think he wuz a mighty
good man.

He done so much for de colored race, but what he done was intended through
de higher power. I don't think slavery wuz right.

I think Mr. Roosevelt is a fine man, one of the best presidents
in the world. I voted for him, and I would vote for him ag'in.
He has done a lot for de people, and is still doin'.

He got a lot of sympathy for 'em.
Yas sir, a lot of sympathy for de people.

MARGARET E. DICKENS 1115 E. Lenoir St.

My name is Margaret E. Dickens and I was born on the 5th of June
1861.
My mother wuz free born; her name wuz Mary Ann Hews, but my mother wuz
colored. I don't remember anything about Marster and Missus. My father
was named Henry Byrd. Here is some of father's writing. My mother's
father was dark. He had no protection. If he did any work for a white man
and the white man didn't like it, he could take him up and whup him.
My father was like a stray dog.

My name was Margaret E. Byrd before I got married. Here is some of father's
writing--"Margaret Elvira Byrd the daughter of Henry and Mary Ann
Byrd was born on the 5th June 1861."

My grandfather, my mother's father was a cabinet maker. He made
coffins and tables and furniture. If he made one, and it didn't suit
the man he would beat him and kick him around and let him go. Dis was
told to me. My father was a carpenter. He built houses.

I can read and write. My father could read and write. My mother could
read, but couldn't write very much.

I have heerd my mother say when she heerd the Yankees were commin' she
had a brand new counterpane, my father owned a place before he
married my mother, the counterpane was a woolen woven counterpane.

She took it off and hid it. The Yankees took anything they wanted, but
failed to find it. We were living in Raleigh, at the time, on the very
premises we are living on now. The old house has been torn down, but
some of the wood is in this very house. I kin show you part of the
old house now. My mother used to pass this place when she wuz
a girl and she told me she never expected to live here.

She was twenty years younger than my father. My mother, she lived here
most of the time except twenty-four years she lived in the North. She
died in 1916. My father bought the lan' in 1848 from a man named
Henry Morgan. Here is the deed.[6]
When we left Raleigh, and went North we first stopped in Cambridge, Mass.
This was with my first husband. His name was Samuel E. Reynolds.
He was a preacher. He had a church and preached there. The East
winds were so strong and cold we couldn't stan' it.

It was too cold for us. We then went to Providence, R. I. From there
to Elmira, N. Y. From there we went to Brooklyn, N. Y. He preached in
the State of New York; we finally came back South, and he died
right here in this house.

I like the North very well, but there is nothing like home, the South.
Another thing I don't have so many white kin folks up North. I don't like
to be called Auntie by anyone, unless they admit bein' kin to me.
I was not a fool when I went to the North, and it made no change in me.
I was raised to respect everybody and I tries to keep it up. Some things
in the North are all right, I like them, but I like the South better.
Yes, I guess I like the South better. I was married to Charles W.
Dickens in 1920. He is my second husband.

I inherited this place from my father Henry Byrd. I like well water.
There is my well, right out here in the yard. This well was dug
here when they were building the first house here. I believe in havin'
your own home, so I have held on to my home, and I am goin' to try
to keep holdin' on to it.

[Footnote 6: An interesting feature of the deed is the fact that Henry
Morgan made his mark while Henry Byrd's signature is his own.]

[HW: language not negro, very senternous & interesting.] [TR: The above
comment is crossed out.]
REVEREND SQUIRE DOWD 202 Battle Street Raleigh, N. C.

My name is Squire Dowd, and I was born April 3, 1855. My mother's name
was Jennie Dowd. My father's name was Elias Kennedy. My mother died
in Georgia at the age of 70, and my father died in Moore County at the
age of 82. I attended his funeral. My sister and her husband had carried
my mother to Georgia, when my sister's husband went there to work in
turpentine. My mother's husband was dead.

She had married a man named Stewart. You could hardly keep up with your
father during slavery time.
It was a hard thing to do. There were few legal marriages. When a young
man from one plantation courted a young girl on the plantation, the master
married them, sometimes hardly knowing what he was saying.

My master was General W. D. Dowd. He lived three miles from Carthage,
in Moore County, North Carolina. He owned fifty slaves. The conditions
were good.

I had only ten years' experience, but it was a good experience. No man is
fool enough to buy slaves to kill. I have never known a real slave
owner to abuse his slaves. The abuse was done by patterollers and
overseers.

I have a conservative view of slavery. I taught school for four years and
I have been in the ministry fifty years. I was ordained a Christian
minister in 1885. I lived in Moore County until 1889, then I moved
to Raleigh. I have feeling.

I don't like for people to have a feeling that slaves are no more than
dogs; I don't like that. It causes people to have the wrong idea of
slavery. Here is John Bectom, a well, healthy friend of mine, 75 years
of age. If we had been treated as some folks say, these big, healthy
niggers would not be walking about in the South now. The great Negro
leaders we have now would never have come out of it.

The places we lived in were called cabins. The Negroes who were thrifty
had nice well-kept homes; and it is thus now. The thrifty of the
colored race live well; the others who are indolent live in hovels which
smell foul and are filthy.

Prayer meetings were held at night in the cabins of the slaves. On Sunday
we went to the white folk's church. We sat in a barred-off place, in
the back of the church or in a gallery.

We had a big time at cornshuckings. We had plenty of good things to eat,
and plenty of whiskey and brandy to drink. These shuckings were held at
night. We had a good time, and I never saw a fight at a
cornshucking in life. If we could catch the master after the shucking
was over, we put him in a chair, we darkies, and toted him around
and hollered, carried him into the parlor, set him down, and combed
his hair.

We only called the old master "master". We called his wife "missus."
When the white children grew up we called them Mars. John, Miss Mary,
etc.

We had some money. We made baskets. On moonlight nights and holidays
we cleared land; the master gave us what we made on the land. We had
money.

The darkies also stole for deserters during the war. They paid us for it.
I ate what I stole, such as sugar. I was not big enough to steal for the
deserters. I was a house boy. I stole honey. I did not know I was free
until five years after the war. I could not realize I was free.
Many of us stayed right on. If we had not been ruined right after the
war by carpetbaggers our race would have been, well,--better up
by this time, because they turned us against our masters, when our
masters had everything and we had nothing.

The Freedmen's Bureau helped us some, but we finally had to go back
to the plantation in order to live.

We got election days, Christmas, New Year, etc., as holidays.

When we were slaves we had a week or more Christmas. The holidays
lasted from Christmas Eve to after New Years. Sometimes we got passes.
If our master would not give them to us, the white boys we played
with would give us one. We played cat, jumping, wrestling and marbles.
We played for fun; we did not play for money. There were 500 acres on
the plantation. We hunted a lot, and the fur of the animals we caught
we sold and had the money. We were allowed to raise a few chickens
and pigs, which we sold if we wanted to.

The white folks rode to church and the darkies walked, as many of the poor
white folks did. We looked upon the poor white folks as our equals.
They mixed with us and helped us to envy our masters. They looked upon
our masters as we did.

Negro women having children by the masters was common. My
relatives on my mother's side, who were Kellys are mixed blooded.
They are partly white. We, the darkies and many of the whites hate that
a situation like this exists. It is enough to say that seeing is believing.
There were many and are now mixed blooded people among the race.

I was well clothed. Our clothes were made in looms. Shoes were made on
the plantation. Distilleries were also located on the plantation. When
they told me I was free, I did not notice it. I did not realize it till
many years after when a man made a speech at Carthage, telling
us we were free.

I did not like the Yankees. We were afraid of them. We had to be
educated to love the Yankees, and to know that they freed us and were
our friends. I feel that Abraham Lincoln was a father to us. We consider
him thus because he freed us. The Freedmen's Bureau and carpet baggers
caused us to envy our masters and the white folks. The Ku Klux Klan,
when we pushed our rights, came in between us, and we did not know
what to do. The Ku Klux were after the carpet baggers and the Negroes
who followed them.

It was understood that white people were not to teach Negroes during
slavery, but many of the whites taught the Negroes. The children of the
white folks made us study. I could read and write when the war was
up.
They made me study books, generally a blue-back spelling book as
punishment for mean things I done.

My Missus, a young lady about 16 years old taught a Sunday School
class of colored boys and girls. This Sunday School was held at a
different time of day from the white folks.
Sometimes old men and old women were in these classes. I remember once
they asked Uncle Ben Pearson who was meekest man, 'Moses' he
replied.

'Who was the wisest man?' 'Soloman', 'Who was the strongest man?' was
then asked him. To this he said 'They say Bill Medlin is the strongest,
but Tom Shaw give him his hands full.' They were men of the
community.
Medlin was white, Shaw was colored.

I do not like the way they have messed up our songs with classical
music.

     I like the songs, 'Roll Jordan Roll', 'Old Ship of Zion', 'Swing
Low Sweet Chariot'.

     Classical singers ruin them, though.
     
     There was no use of our going to town of Saturday afternoon to buy
     our rations, so we worked Saturday afternoons. When we got sick
     the doctors treated us. Dr. J. D. Shaw, Dr. Bruce, and Dr. Turner.
     They were the first doctors I ever heard any tell of. They
     treated both whites and darkies on my master's plantation.
     

     I married a Matthews, Anna Matthews, August 1881.

     We have one daughter.

     Her name is Ella.

She married George Cheatam of Henderson, N. C. A magistrate married us,
Mr. Pitt Cameron. It was just a quiet wedding on Saturday night
with about one-half dozen of my friends present.

My idea of life is to forget the bad and live for the good there is in
it. This is my motto.

FANNIE DUNN 222 Heck Street, Raleigh, N. C.

I don't 'zakly know my age, but I knows and 'members when de Yankees
come through Wake County.

I wus a little girl an' wus so skeered I run an hid under de bed.
De Yankees stopped at de plantation an' along de road fur a rest. I
'members I had diphtheria an' a Yankee doctor come an' mopped my throat.
Dey had to pull me outen under de bed so he could doctor me.

One Yankee would come along an' give us sumptin' an another would
come on behind him an' take it. Dats de way dey done. One give mother a
mule an' when dey done gone she sold it.

A Yankee give mother a ham of meat, another come right on behind
him an' took it away from her. Dere shore wus a long line of dem
Yankees.

I can 'member seeing 'em march by same as it wus yisterday. I wus not
old enough to work, but I 'members 'em. I don't know 'zackly but
I wus 'bout five years old when de surrender wus.
My name before I wus married wus Fannie Sessoms an' mother wus named
Della Sessoms. We belonged to Dr. Isaac Sessoms an' our missus wus
named Hanna. My father wus named Perry Vick, after his marster who
wus named Perry Vick. My missus died durin' de war an' marster never
married anymore.
I don't 'member much 'bout missus but mother tole me she wus some
good woman an' she loved her. Marster wus mighty good to us an'
didn't allow patterollers to whip us none. De slave houses wus warm
and really dey wus good houses, an' didn't leak neither.
I don't 'member much 'bout my grandparents, just a little mother
tole me 'bout 'em. Grandma 'longed to de Sessoms an' Dr. Isaac
Sessoms brother wus mother's father. Mother tole me dat. Look at
dat picture, mister, you see you can't tell her from a white woman.
Dats my mother's picture. She wus as white as you wid long hair an'
a face like a white woman. She been dead 'bout twenty years. My
mother said dat we all fared good, but course we wore homemade
clothes an' wooden bottomed shoes.
We went to the white folks church at Red Oak an' Rocky Mount
Missionary Baptist Churches. We were allowed to have prayer meetings
at de slave houses, two an' three times a week. I 'members goin'
to church 'bout last year of de war wid mother. I had a apple wid
me an' I got hungry an' wanted to eat it in meetin' but mother jest
looked at me an' touched my arm, dat wus enough. I didn't eat de
apple. I can 'member how bad I wanted to eat it. Don't 'member much
'bout dat sermon, guess I put my mind on de apple too much.
Marster had about twenty slaves an' mother said dey had always been
allowed to go to church an' have prayer meetings 'fore I wus
born.
Marster had both white an' colored overseers but he would not allow
any of his overseers to bulldoze over his slaves too much. He would
call a overseer down for bein' rough at de wrong time. Charles
Sessoms wus one of marster's colored overseers. He 'longed to
marster, an' mother said marster always listened to what Charles
said. Dey said marster had always favored him even 'fore he made
him overseer. Charles Sessoms fell dead one day an' mother found
him. She called Marster Sessoms an' he come an' jest cried. Mother
said when Marster come he wus dead shore enough, dat marster jest
boohooed an' went to de house, an' wouldn't look at him no more
till dey started to take him to de grave. Everybody on de plantation
went to his buryin' an' funeral an' some from de udder plantation
dat joined ourn.
I 'members but little 'bout my missus, but 'members one time she
run me when I wus goin' home from de great house, an' she said, 'I
am goin' to catch you, now I catch you'. She pickin' at me made me
love her. When she died mother tole me 'bout her bein' dead an'
took me to her buryin'.
Next day I wanted to go an' get her up. I tole mother I wanted her
to come home an' eat. Mother cried an' took me up in her arms, an'
said, 'Honey missus will never eat here again.' I wus so young I
didn't understand.
Dr. Sessoms an' also Dr. Drake, who married his daughter, doctored
us when we wus sick. Dr. Joe Drake married marster's only daughter
Harriet an' his only son David died in Mississippi. He had a
plantation dere.
I been married only once. I wus married forty years ago to Sidney

Without dwelling upon the numerous
consequences which flow from meteorological influences, let us see what
is properly included under the subject of Meteorology. And first,
of the Atmosphere.

This is a gaseous, vapor-bearing, elastic fluid, surrounding the
earth. Its volume is estimated at 1/29th, and its weight at about
43/1000ths, that of the globe.

It is composed of 21 parts in weight of Oxygen and 77 of Nitrogen, with a
little Carbonic Acid, Aqueous Vapor, and a trace of Carburetted
Hydrogen. There are numerous well-known calculations of the proportions
of the various constituents of the atmosphere, which we owe to Priestley,
Dalton, Black, Cavendish, Liebig, and others; but that given by
Professor Ansted is sufficiently simple and intelligible. In 10 volumes
or parts of it, he gives to

Oxygen, the great supporter of life 2.100 Nitrogen, (not condensible under
50 atmospheres, and not respirable or combustible,) 7.750 Aqueous Vapor
.l42 Carbonic Acid .004 Carburetted Hydrogen .004 ______ 10.000
and he adds a trace of Ammoniacal Vapor. It is _usual_ to state the
proportions of air as being 1 Oxygen to 4 Nitrogen.

It is a curious fact, that, while there are six varieties of compounds
of nitrogen and oxygen, but one of these is fitted to sustain life,
and that is our atmosphere.

It is well enough to note, that, when we use the word volume or measure,
in speaking of the atmosphere or any gaseous body, we adopt the
theory of Gay-Lussac, who discovered that gases unite with each
other in definite proportions whenever they enter into combination.

This theory led to important results; for by knowing the elements of a
compound gas, we easily determine its specific gravity.

It has been attempted to apply the principle to organic bodies; but it
has not yet been carried to a full and satisfactory conclusion. It may
be noticed, too, that Dalton affirmed that simple substances unite with
each other in definite weights to form compound substances, thus supporting
the idea of Lussac. These discoveries were made about the same time,
Dalton having the credit of originating them.

Various modifications of the principle have been from time to time
presented to public attention.

Whether the constituents of the atmosphere are chemically or
mechanically combined,--one of the things about which the learned
are not fully agreed,--it is found to be chemically the same in its
constituents, all over the world, whether collected on mountains
or on plains, on the sea or on the land, whether obtained by aëronauts
miles above the earth or by miners in their deepest excavations.

On the theory of its mechanical combination, however, as by volume,
and that each constituent acts freely for itself and according to
its own laws, important speculations (conclusions, indeed) have
arisen, both as regards temperature and climatic differences.

It should be observed, that volume, as we have used the word,
is the apparent space occupied, and differs from mass, which is the
_effective_ space occupied, or the real bulk of matter, while
density is the relation of mass to volume, or the quotient resulting
from the division of the one by the other.

Those empty spaces which render the volume larger than the mass are
technically called its pores.

Has the composition of the atmosphere changed in the lapse of years?

On this point both French and German philosophers have largely
speculated. It is computed that it contains about two millions of cubic
geographical miles of oxygen, and that 12,500 cubic geographical
miles of carbonic acid have been breathed out into the air or
otherwise given out in the course of five thousand years.

The inference, then, should be, that the latter exists in the air in the
proportion of 1 to 160, whereas we find but 4 parts in 10,000.

Dumas and Bossingault decided that no change had taken place, verifying
their conclusion by experiments founded on observations for more than
thirty-five years. No _chemical_ combination of oxygen and nitrogen has
ever been detected in the atmosphere, and it is presumed none will
be.

* * * * *

The atmosphere possesses, as may be readily imagined, many important
characteristics. One of these is Weight.

This is demonstrated by simple, yet decisive experiments. The discovery
of the _fact_ is attributed to the illustrious Galileo, but to modern
science we owe all the certainty, variety, and elegance of the
demonstration.

A vessel containing a quantity of air is weighed; the air is exhausted
from it and it is weighed again.

An accurate scale will then detect the difference of weight.

A cubic foot of air weighs 1.2 oz. Hence a column of air of one inch in
diameter and a mile in height weighs 44 oz.

The atmosphere is supposed to have an elevation of from 45 to 50 miles,
but its weight diminishes in proportion to its height. The whole pressure
at the surface of the earth is estimated to be 15 lbs.
to the square inch; a person of ordinary size is consequently pressed
upon by a weight of from 13 to 14 tons.

Happily for us, the pressure from without is counteracted by the pressure
from within.

The weight of the air is of great importance in the economy of Nature,
since it prevents the excessive evaporation of the waters upon the
earth's surface, and limits its extent by unalterable laws. Water
boils at a certain temperature when at the earth's surface, where
the weight of the atmosphere is greatest, but at different
temperatures at different elevations from the surface.

At the level of the sea it boils at 212°. On the high plains of Quito,
8,724 feet above the sea, it boils at 194°, and an egg cannot be cooked
there in an open vessel.
At Potosí the boiling-point is still lower, being 188°, and the barometrical
column stands at 18°. Indeed, the experiment is often exhibited at
our chemical lectures, of a flask containing a small quantity of water,
which, exhausted of air, is made to boil by the ordinary heat of the
hand.

Fahrenheit proposed to ascertain the height of mountains by this
principle, and a simple apparatus was contrived for the purpose,
which is now in successful use. The late Professor Forbes of Edinburgh,
whose untimely death the friends of science have had so much reason
to deplore, ascertained that the temperature of boiling water varied
arithmetically with the height, and at the rate of one degree of
the thermometric scale for every 549.05 feet.

Multiplying the difference of the boiling-point by this number of feet,
we have the elevation.
The weight of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, is
also a means for ascertaining the height of mountains or of plains;
but correction must be made for the effects of expansion or
contraction, and for capillarity, or the attraction between the
mercury and the glass tube, at least whenever great exactness is
required.

Tables for the convenience of calculation are given in several
scientific works, and particularly in a paper of Professor Forbes, Ed.
Trans. Vol. 15.
Briefly, however, we may state, that between 0° and 32°, 34
thousandths of an inch must be allowed for depression or
contraction, and between 32° and 52° 33 thousandths. The weight of the
atmosphere is not only affected by rarefaction, but by currents
of air, which give it a sudden density or rarity.

Those who have ascended mountains have experienced both these
changes.

A common experiment to prove the weight of air is that of the Magdeburg
Hemispheres, a simple contrivance of Otto Guericke, a merchant of
that city. It is a part of every complete philosophical apparatus.
It consists of brass caps, which, when joined together, fit tightly
and become a globe. The air within being exhausted, it will be found
difficult to separate them. If the superficies be 100 square inches
and the height of the mercury be 30 inches, the atmosphere will press on
these hemispheres with a weight of 1,475 lbs, requiring the efforts
of seven or eight powerful men to tear them asunder.

One of these instruments, of the diameter of a German ell, required the
strength of 24 horses to separate it. The experiment was publicly made
in 1650 at the Imperial Diet at Rendsborg, in the presence of the Emperor
Ferdinand III. and a large number of princes and nobles, much to
their astonishment.

As compared with water, the air (the barometer indicating 30°, and the
thermometer 55°) is 833 times lighter.

It is this weight of the atmosphere which counterbalances that of a column
of mercury 29 inches in height, and a column of water 32 to 34 feet in
height.

The old quaint notion of Nature's abhorring a vacuum was found to
be practically only an assertion that the air had weight. The
ordinary pump, commonly called the suction-pump, is constructed on
this principle. The weight of the atmosphere at the level of the sea is
found to be the same all over the world.

* * * * *
We find the atmosphere with another characteristic,--Elasticity.

However it may be compressed, air returns, on liberation, to its
original volume, and while thus perfectly elastic it is also the
most compressible of bodies.

This elasticity arises from the repulsive force of its particles,
and is always equal to the compressive force which it balances.

A glass vessel full of air, placed under a receiver and then exhausted
by the air-pump, will burst into atoms. Water, on the other hand, is
almost the reverse. Twenty cubic inches, introduced into a cannon
whose sides are three inches thick, cannot be compressed into nineteen
inches without bursting it. This non-elastic property of water, with
another, that of communicating, when under the action of any force,
an equal pressure in all directions, led to the invention of
the hydraulic press.

The elasticity of the air enables fishes to rise and sink in water, through
the action of the air-bladder.

The sudden compression of air liberates its latent heat, and produces
fire. On this principle the pneumatic tinder-box is constructed.

Brockhaus says that air has as yet been compressed only into
one-eighth of its original bulk.

For every degree of heat between the freezing-point and the boiling-point,
32° and 212°, the expansion of air is about 1/490th part, so that any
invention which seeks to use rarefied air as a motive power must employ
a very intense degree of heat, enough to fuse many kinds of metals.

To the celebrated Mr. Boyle and to Henry Cavendish, both of Great
Britain, we are indebted for most of what we know of this particular
property of the air.

* * * * *

Density, or closeness, is another quality of the atmosphere. It has been
found to be 770 times less than that of water, and 770 cubic inches
of air weigh as much as a cubic inch of water.

It is in direct ratio with its elasticity, and there are tables by which
it may be determined at different altitudes. At the surface of the earth,
this density is indicated as 1; at 2-1/2 miles, as 1/2; at 5 miles,
as 1/4; and so on, the difference being in a geometrical progression.

As we proceed in the consideration of our general subject, we shall find,
under the appropriate heads, that density is not without material
influence on reflection and refraction, on transparency and the
transmission of light, the presence or absence of moisture, and the
amount of heat at the earth's surface,--and we might add, on health,
and the increase or diminution of the vital energies

.

* * * * *
Temperature is another branch of our subject, and one involving a series
of subordinate topics on which volumes have been written, and to
which are still devoted the labors of the most learned men of our
day.

In this place, merely an out-line can be attempted.

Temperature is the degree of heat or cold in the particles of all bodies,
which is perceptible by sensation, and is measurable by their expansion
or contraction.

It is the key to the theory of the winds, of rain, of aerial and
oceanic currents, of vegetation and climate with all their multifarious
and important differences.

While the inclined position of the earth on its axis and its movement
in its elliptical orbit influence the general amount of heat, it is rather
to the consequences of these in detail that we are called when we speak
of temperature. If the sun shone on a uniformly level surface, everywhere
of the same conducting and radiating power, there would be but
little difficulty in tracing the monotonous effects of temperature.

The reformer Luther, as eccentric as he was learned and sincere,
is reported to have said, that, if he had been consulted at the
Creation, he would have placed the sun directly over the centre of
the world and kept it there, to give unchanging and uniform light
and heat!

It is certainly much better that he was not consulted. In that case, every
parallel of latitude would have been isothermal, or of equal mean annual
temperature. The seasons would have been invariable in character.

Some portions of the earth would have been scorched to crispness,
others locked up in never-changing ice.

Vegetation, instead of being universal, would have been confined
to a narrow zone; and the whole human race would have been driven
together into one limited habitable space, to interfere with,
incommode, and destroy each other.

The arrangement is best as it is.

We find very important modifications of temperature, occasioned not
only by astronomical influences, but by local causes and geographical
characteristics.

For while, as a general rule, the nearer we approach the equator, the
warmer we shall be, yet temperature is greatly affected by mountains,
seas, currents of air or water, by radiation, by forests, and by
vegetation.

It is found, in fact, that the lines of temperature, (the happy
conception of Humboldt,) when they are traced upon the map, are
anything but true zones or circles.

The line of the greatest mean warmth is not coincident with the equator,
but falls to the north of it. This line at 160° W. Long, from Greenwich
is 4° below the geographical equator; at 80° it is about 6°
north, sweeping along the coast of New Granada; at 20° it comes down
and touches the equator; at 40° E. Long., it crosses the Red Sea about
16° north of the equator, and at 120° it falls at Borneo, several degrees
below it;--and the points of the greatest heat, in this line, are in
Abyssinia, nearer the tropic of Cancer than to the equator. On the other
hand, the greatest mean cold points, according to the opinions of Humboldt,
Sir David Brewster, and others, do not coincide, as would seem natural,
with the geographical poles, but they are both to be found in the
northern hemisphere, in Latitude 80°, 95°E.

Long.
and 100° W. Long. from Greenwich. The western is ascertained to be
4-1/2° colder than the eastern or Siberian. If this be the fact,--but
it is not positively admitted,--an open sea at the pole may be
considered as probable, on the ground of its having a higher mean
temperature than is found at 80°.

Kaemptz places one of these cold points at the north of Barrow's Straits,--the
other near Cape Taimur, in Siberia. Burghaus, in his Atlas, transfers the
American cold pole to 78° N. Lat.

It is perhaps too early to determine rigorously the true
temperature of these points.

A noticeable fact also is this,--that places in the same latitude
rarely receive the same amount of heat.

Quebec, in British America, and Drontheim, in Norway, enjoy about the
same quantity, while the former is in 47° and the latter in 68° N. Lat.
The mean winter temperature of Pekin, 39° 45' N.

Lat., is 5° below the freezing-point; while at Naples, which is
north of Pekin, it seldom, if ever, goes below it, and Paris, 500
miles farther north, has a mean winter temperature of 6° above the
freezing-point.

The city of New York, about 11° south of London, has a winter temperature
of much greater severity. The mean temperature of the State of New
York, as determined by a long series of observations, is 44° 31'.

The mean temperature of countries is found to be very stable, and but
very small variations have been detected in modern times. But that
there have been important climatic changes, since the Christian
era, cannot be doubted, unless we doubt history. Not many centuries ago,
it was a common thing for all the British rivers to freeze up
during the winter, and to remain so for several months.

If space permitted, an interesting statement could he made of the
changes which have taken place in vegetation in Greenland, and throughout
certain northern parts of Europe,--also in Palestine, Greece, and other
southern countries,--while we know that the earth's inclination upon its
axis has been unchanged.

Mrs.

Somerville remarks, that, though the temperature of any one place may
be subject to very great variations, yet it never differs from the mean
state more than a few degrees.

Without this atmospheric covering of ours, it is considered that
the temperature of the earth at its surface would be the same as
that of the celestial spaces, supposed to be at least 76° below
zero, or _possibly_, says Humboldt, 1400° below!

Human life, without our atmosphere, could not exist for a single moment.

It is computed, that, if the annual heat received by the earth on its
surface could be equally distributed over it, it would melt, in
the course of a year, a stratum of ice 46 feet thick, though it
covered the whole globe, and as a consequence the amount of unradiated
heat would render it uninhabitable.

The relative position of the sun affects temperature, rather than its
distance.

In winter the earth is three millions of miles nearer the sun than in
summer, but the oblique rays of the former season reach us in less
quantity than the more direct The distribution of land and water,
the nature of the soil, the indentation of bays, the elevation of land
above the sea-level, insularity, etc., all, as we have already
suggested, have a modifying influence on temperature.

The atmosphere possesses also a reflecting and refracting power, arising
from its varying density, and, perhaps, in the latter case, somewhat
from its lenticular outline.

But for this property we should have no twilight. The sun, instead of
sending up his beams while 18° below the visible horizon, would
come upon us out of an intense darkness, pass over our sky a brazen
inglorious orb, and set in an instant amid unwelcome night.

Reflection is the rebound of the rays of light or heat from an opposing
surface at the same angle as that at which they fall upon it.

These are called angles of incidence and reflection, and are equal.

Refraction is the bending of a ray passing obliquely from a rarer into
a denser medium. This may be observed when a rod is placed slantingly
in a vessel of clear water; the part immersed will appear bent or broken.
This is ordinary refraction.

Terrestrial refraction is the same thing, occurring whenever there is a
difference of density in the aerial strata.

The atmosphere absorbs some portion of the light which it receives. It
is not all reflected or refracted or even penetrative.

Objects seen under various degrees of light, either convected or retarded
by different media, appear near or distant, distinct or confused.

Thus, we are often surprised at the apparent nearness and brightness of
an opposite shore or neighboring island, in some conditions of the air,
while at other times they seem distant and lie in shadowy obscurity.

The looming up of a vessel on the water is another common instance of the
principle of refraction.

It has been noticed by almost every one, that, during the warm and
moist nights of summer, the moon, as she rises above the horizon,
appears much larger than when at the zenith.

So the setting sun is seen of apparently increased size.

Sir John Herschel asserts that the appearance is an illusion, and
so do some others.

Professor Carey says, that, if we look through a paper tube at the moon
when on the horizon, the paper being folded so as to make the aperture
of its exact size, and then look again at it when it reaches the zenith,
we shall find there is no difference.

On the other hand, an experiment is offered by a German Professor, of
the name of Milo, of this kind: If we look through a tube so constructed
as to have one side filled with spirits of wine and the other with common
air, the half of the object seen through the former will be found to
appear much larger to the eye than the other half seen through the
latter.

It is laid down, that, where extraordinary refraction takes place laterally
or vertically, the visual angle of the spectator is singularly enlarged,
and objects are magnified, as if seen through a telescope. Dr. Scoresby,
a celebrated meteorologist and navigator, mentions some curious
instances of the effects of refraction seen by him in the Arctic
Ocean.

Many remarkable phenomena attend this state of the atmosphere, known as
the Fata Morgana of Sicily, the Mirage of the Desert, the Spectre of
the Brocken, and the more common exhibitions of halos, coronæ, and
mock suns. The Mountain House at Catskill has repeatedly been seen
brightly pictured on the clouds below.

     Rainbows are also due to this condition of the atmosphere.

     
     If we had a fire
     in cold weather where we wus wurkin' marster or de overseer would
     come an' put it out. We et frozen meat an' bread many times in
     cold weather. After de day's wurk in de fields wus over we had
     a task of pickin' de seed from cotton till we had two ounces of
     lint or spin two ounces of cotton on a spinnin' wheel.
     I spun cotton on a spinnin' wheel. Dats de way people got clothes in
     slavery time.
     
     I can't read an' write but dey learned us to count. Dey learned us
     to count dis way.

     'Ought is an' ought, an' a figger is a figger, all for de white man
an' nothin' fer de nigger'.

     Hain't you heard people count dat way?

Dey sold slaves jes' like people sell hosses now. I saw a lot of slaves
sold on de auction block. Dey would strip 'em stark naked. A nigger
scarred up or whaled an' welted up wus considered a bad nigger an' did
not bring much. If his body wus not scarred, he brought a good price.
I saw a lot of slaves whupped an' I was whupped myself. Dey whupped
me wid de cat o' nine tails. It had nine lashes on it. Some of de
slaves wus whupped wid a cabbin paddle. Dey had forty holes in' em an'
when you wus buckled to a barrel dey hit your naked flesh wid de paddle
an' every whur dere wus a hole in de paddle it drawed a blister.
When de whuppin' wid de paddle wus over, dey took de cat o' nine
tails an' busted de blisters.

By dis time de blood sometimes would be runnin' down dere heels. Den de
next thing wus a wash in salt water strong enough to hold up an egg.
Slaves wus punished dat way fer runnin' away an' sich.

If you wus out widout a pass dey would shore git you. De paterollers
shore looked after you. Dey would come to de house at night to see who
wus there. If you wus out of place, dey would wear you out.

Sam Joyner, a slave, belonged to marster.

He wus runnin' from de paterollers an' he fell in a ole well. De pateroller
went after marster.
Marster tole' em to git ole Sam out an' whup him jes' as much as
dey wanted to. Dey got him out of de well an' he wus all wet an' muddy.
Sam began takin' off his shoes, den he took off his pants an' got
in his shirt tail. Marster, he say, 'What you takin' off you clothes
fer Sam?'

Sam, he say, 'Marster, you know you all can't whup dis nigger right
over all dese wet clothes.' Den Sam lit out. He run so fas' he nearly
flew.
De paterollers got on dere hosses an' run him but dey could not ketch
him. He got away. Marster got Sam's clothes an' carried 'em to de
house.
Sam slipped up next morning put his clothes on an' marster said no more
about it.

I wus a great big boy when de Yankees come through.

I wus drivin' a two mule team an' doin' other wurk on de farm.

I drove a two hoss wagon when dey carried slaves to market.

I went to a lot of different places.

My marster wus a preacher, Billy Boone. He sold an' bought niggers.
He had fifty or more. He wurked the grown niggers in two squads. My
father wus named Isham Boone and my mother wus Sarah Boone. Marster
Boone whupped wid de cobbin paddle an' de cat o' nine tails an' used the
salt bath an' dat wus 'nough. Plenty besides him whupped dat
way.
Marster had one son, named Solomon, an' two girls, Elsie an' Alice.
My mother had four children, three boys an' one girl. The boys were
named Sam, Walter and Andrew, dats me, an' de girl wus Cherry.
My father had several children cause he had several women besides
mother. Mollie and Lila Lassiter, two sisters, were also his
women.
Dese women wus given to him an' no udder man wus allowed to have
anything to do wid 'em. Mollie an' Lila both had chilluns by him.
Dere names wus Jim, Mollie, Liza, Rosa, Pete an' I can't remember
no more of 'em.
De Yankees took jes' what dey wanted an' nothin' stopped 'em, cause
de surrender had come. Before de surrender de slave owners begun
to scatter de slaves 'bout from place to place to keep de Yankees
from gittin' 'em.
If de Yankees took a place de slaves nearby wus moved to a place
further off.
All I done wus fer de Rebels. I wus wid 'em an' I jes' done what I
wus tole.You know I've never had one since Anne gave up the
position."

COMPOUND SENTENCES.

[Sidenote: _How formed._]
382. The compound sentence is a combination of two or more simple or
complex sentences. While the complex sentence has only _one_ main clause,
the compound has _two or more_ independent clauses making statements,
questions, or commands.

Hence the definition,--

[Sidenote: _Definition._]
383. A compound sentence is one which contains two or more independent
clauses.

This leaves room for any number of subordinate clauses in a compound
sentence: the requirement is simply that it have at least two
independent clauses.

Examples of compound sentences:--
[Sidenote: _Examples._]
(1) _Simple sentences united:_ "He is a palace of sweet sounds and
sights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with arms akimbo;
he soliloquizes

."
(2) _Simple with complex:_ "The trees of the forest, the waving grass,
and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent; and he almost fears to
trust them with the secret which they seem to invite."
(3) _Complex with complex:_ "The power which resides in him is new in
nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor
does he know until he has tried." 

384.

From this it is evident that nothing new is added to the work of analysis
already done.

The same analysis of simple sentences is repeated in (1) and (2) above,
and what was done in complex sentences is repeated in (2) and (3).

The division into members will be easier, for the coördinate independent
statements are readily taken apart with the subordinate clauses
attached, if there are any.

Thus in (1), the semicolons cut apart the independent members, which
are simple statements; in (2), the semicolon separates the first,
a simple member, from the second, a complex member; in (3), _and_
connects the first and second complex members, and _nor_ the
second and third complex members.

[Sidenote: _Connectives._]
385. The coördinate conjunctions _and_, _nor_, _or_ _but_, etc., introduce
independent clauses (see Sec. 297).

But the conjunction is often omitted in copulative and adversative
clauses, as in Sec. 383 (1). Another example is, "Only the star dazzles;
the planet has a faint, moon-like ray" (adversative).

[Sidenote: _Study the thought._]
386. The one point that will give trouble is the variable use of
some connectives; as _but_, _for_, _yet_, _while_ (_whilst_),
_however_, _whereas_, etc. Some of these are now conjunctions, now
adverbs or prepositions; others sometimes coördinate, sometimes
subordinate conjunctions.

The student must watch _the logical connection_ of the members of the
sentence, and not the form of the connective.

PART III.

_SYNTAX_.

INTRODUCTORY.

[Sidenote: _By way of introduction._]
388. Syntax is from a Greek word meaning _order_ or _arrangement_.

Syntax deals with the relation of words to each other as component
parts of a sentence, and with their proper arrangement to express clearly
the intended meaning.

[Sidenote: _Ground covered by syntax._]
380. Following the Latin method, writers on English grammar usually
divide syntax into the two general heads,--agreement and government.

Agreement is concerned with the following relations of words: words
in apposition, verb and subject, pronoun and antecedent, adjective and
noun.

Government has to do with verbs and prepositions, both of which are said
to govern words by having them in the objective case.

390. Considering the scarcity of inflections in English, it is clear
that if we merely follow the Latin treatment, the department of syntax
will be a small affair. But there is a good deal else to watch in addition
to the few forms; for there is an important and marked difference
between Latin and English syntax. It is this:--
Latin syntax depends upon fixed rules governing the use of inflected
forms: hence the _position_ of words in a sentence is of little grammatical
importance.

[Sidenote: _Essential point in English syntax._]
English syntax follows the Latin to a limited extent; but its leading
characteristic is, that English syntax is founded upon _the meaning_
and _the logical connection_ of words rather than upon their form:
consequently it is quite as necessary to place words properly, and to
think clearly of the meaning of words, as to study inflected forms.

For example, the sentence, "The savage here the settler slew," is
ambiguous.

_Savage_ may be the subject, following the regular order of subject;
or _settler_ may be the subject, the order being inverted. In Latin,
distinct forms would be used, and it would not matter which one
stood first.

[Sidenote: _Why study syntax?_]
391. There is, then, a double reason for not omitting syntax
as a department of grammar,--
_First_, To study the rules regarding the use of inflected forms,
some of which conform to classical grammar, while some are idiomatic
(peculiar to our own language).

_Second_, To find out the _logical methods_ which control us in the
arrangement of words; and particularly when the grammatical and the
logical conception of a sentence do not agree, or when they exist side
by side in good usage.

As an illustration of the last remark, take the sentence, "Besides these
famous books of Scott's and Johnson's, there is a copious 'Life' by
Sheridan." In this there is a possessive form, and added to it the
preposition _of_, also expressing a possessive relation.

This is not logical; it is not consistent with the general rules
of grammar: but none the less it is good English.

Also in the sentence, "None remained but he," grammatical rules would
require _him_ instead of _he_ after the preposition; yet the expression
is sustained by good authority.

[Sidenote: _Some rules not rigid._]
392. In some cases, authorities--that is, standard writers--differ as to
which of two constructions should be used, or the same writer will use
both indifferently. Instances will be found in treating of the pronoun
or noun with a gerund, pronoun and antecedent, sometimes verb and
subject, etc.

When usage varies as to a given construction, both forms will be
given in the following pages.

[Sidenote: _The basis of syntax._]
393. Our treatment of syntax will be an endeavor to record the best usage
of the present time on important points; and nothing but important
points will be considered, for it is easy to confuse a student with too
many obtrusive _don'ts_.

The constructions presented as general will be justified by quotations
from _modern writers of English_ who are regarded as "standard;"
that is, writers whose style is generally acknowledged as superior,
and whose judgment, therefore, will be accepted by those in quest of
authoritative opinion.

Reference will also be made to spoken English when its constructions
differ from those of the literary language, and to vulgar English when
it preserves forms which were once, but are not now, good English.

It may be suggested to the student that the only way to acquire
correctness is to watch good usage _everywhere_, and imitate it.

NOUNS.

394. Nouns have no distinct forms for the nominative and objective cases:
hence no mistake can be made in using them. But some remarks are
required concerning the use of the possessive case.

[Sidenote: _Use of the possessive. Joint possession._]
395. When two or more possessives modify the same noun, or indicate
joint ownership or possession, the possessive sign is added to the
last noun only; for example,--
Live your _king and country's_ best support.

--ROWE.

Woman, _sense and nature's_ easy fool.--BYRON.

_Oliver and Boyd's_ printing office.

--MCCULLOCH.

_Adam and Eve's_ morning hymn.

--MILTON.

In _Beaumont and Fletcher's_ "Sea Voyage," Juletta tells, etc.--EMERSON.

[Sidenote: _Separate possession._]
396. When two or more possessives stand before the same noun, but
imply separate possession or ownership, the possessive sign is
used with each noun; as,--
He lands us on a grassy stage, Safe from the _storm's_ and _prelate's_
rage.

--MARVELL
Where were the sons of Peers and Members of Parliament in _Anne's_
and _George's_ time?

--THACKERAY.

_Levi's_ station in life was the receipt of custom; and _Peter's_, the
shore of Galilee; and _Paul's_, the antechamber of the High
Priest.--RUSKIN.

Swift did not keep _Stella's_ letters. He kept _Bolingbroke's,_ and
_Pope's_, and _Harley's_, and _Peterborough's_.--THACKERAY.

An actor in one of _Morton's_ or _Kotzebue's_ plays.--MACAULAY.

Putting _Mr.

Mill's_ and _Mr. Bentham's_ principles together.
--_Id._

397.

The possessive preceding the gerund will be considered under the
possessive of pronouns (Sec. 408).

PRONOUNS.

PERSONAL PRONOUNS.

I. NOMINATIVE AND OBJECTIVE FORMS.
398. Since most of the personal pronouns, together with the relative
_who_, have separate forms for nominative and objective use, there
are two general rules that require attention.
[Sidenote: _General rules._]
(1) The _nominative use_ is usually marked by the nominative form
of the pronoun.
(2) The _objective use_ is usually marked by the objective form of
the pronoun.
These simple rules are sometimes violated in spoken and in literary
English. Some of the violations are universally condemned; others
are generally, if not universally, sanctioned.
[Sidenote: _Objective for the nominative._]
399. The objective is sometimes found instead of the nominative in
the following instances:--
(1) By a common vulgarism of ignorance or carelessness, no notice
is taken of the proper form to be used as subject; as,--
He and _me_ once went in the dead of winter in a one-hoss shay out
to Boonville.--WHITCHER, _Bedott Papers._
It seems strange to me that _them_ that preach up the doctrine don't
admire one who carrys it out.--_Josiah Allens Wife._
(2) By faulty analysis of the sentence, the true relation of the
words is misunderstood; for example, "_Whom_ think ye that I am?"
(In this, _whom_ is the complement after the verb _am_, and should
be the nominative form, _who_.) "The young Harper, _whom_ they agree
was rather nice-looking" (_whom_ is the subject of the verb
_was_).
Especially is this fault to be noticed after an ellipsis with _than_
or _as_, the real thought being forgotten; thus,--
But the consolation coming from devotion did not go far with such
a one as _her_.--TROLLOPE.
This should be "as _she_," because the full expression would be
"such a one as _she is_."
400. Still, the last expression has the support of many good writers,
as shown in the following examples:--
She was neither better bred nor wiser than you or _me_.--THACKERAY.
No mightier than thyself or _me_.--SHAKESPEARE.
Lin'd with Giants deadlier than _'em_ all.--POPE.
But he must be a stronger than _thee_.--SOUTHEY.
Not to render up my soul to such as _thee_.--BYRON.
I shall not learn my duty from such as _thee_.--FIELDING.
[Sidenote: _A safe rule._]
It will be safer for the student to follow the general rule, as
illustrated in the following sentences:--
If so, they are yet holier than _we_.--RUSKIN.
Who would suppose it is the game of such as _he_?--DICKENS.
Do we see The robber and the murd'rer weak as _we_?
--MILTON.
I have no other saint than _thou_ to pray to.--LONGFELLOW.
[Sidenote: "_Than_ whom."]
401. One exception is to be noted. The expression than whom seems
to be used universally instead of "than _who_." There is no special
reason for this, but such is the fact; for example,--
One I remember especially,--one _than whom_ I never met a bandit
more gallant.--THACKERAY.
The camp of Richard of England, _than whom_ none knows better how
to do honor to a noble foe.--SCOTT.
She had a companion who had been ever agreeable, and her estate a
steward _than whom_ no one living was supposed to be more
competent.--PARTON.
[Sidenote: "_It was_ he" _or_ "_It was_ him"?]
402. And there is one question about which grammarians are not
agreed, namely, whether the nominative or the objective form should
be used in the predicate after _was_, _is_, _are_, and the other
forms of the verb _be_.
It may be stated with assurance that the literary language _prefers
the nominative_ in this instance, as,--
For there was little doubt that it was _he_.--KINGSLEY.
But still it is not _she_.--MACAULAY.
And it was _he_ That made the ship to go.
--COLERIDGE.
In spoken English, on the other hand, both in England and America,
the objective form is regularly found, unless a special, careful
effort is made to adopt the standard usage. The following are
examples of spoken English from conversations:--
"Rose Satterne, the mayor's daughter?"--"That's _her_."--KINGSLEY.
"Who's there?"--"_Me_, Patrick the Porter."--WINTHROP.
"If there is any one embarrassed, it will not be _me_."--WM.
BLACK.
The usage is too common to need further examples.

Exercise.
Correct the italicized pronouns in the following sentences, giving
reasons from the analysis of the sentence:--
1. _Whom_ they were I really cannot specify.
2. Truth is mightier than _us_ all.
3. If there ever was a rogue in the world, it is _me_.
4. They were the very two individuals _whom_ we thought were far
away.
5. "Seems to me as if _them_ as writes must hev a kinder gift fur
it, now."
6. The sign of the Good Samaritan is written on the face of
_whomsoever_ opens to the stranger.
7. It is not _me_ you are in love with.
8. You know _whom_ it is that you thus charge.
9. The same affinity will exert its influence on _whomsoever_ is
as noble as these men and women.
10. It was _him_ that Horace Walpole called a man who never made a
bad figure but as an author.
11. We shall soon see which is the fittest object of scorn, you or
_me_.

[Sidenote: Me _in exclamations_.]
403. It is to be remembered that the objective form is used in
exclamations which turn the attention upon a person; as,--
Unhappy _me!_ That I cannot risk my own worthless life.--KINGSLEY
Alas! miserable _me_! Alas! unhappy Señors!--_Id._
Ay _me_! I fondly dream--had ye been there.--MILTON.
[Sidenote: Nominative for the objective.]
404. The rule for the objective form is wrongly departed from--

(1) When the object is far removed from the verb, verbal, or
preposition which governs it; as, "_He_ that can doubt whether he
be anything or no, I speak not to" (_he_ should be _him_, the object
of _to_); "I saw men very like him at each of the places mentioned,
but not _he_" (_he_ should be _him_, object of _saw_).
(2) In the case of certain pairs of pronouns, used after verbs,
verbals, and prepositions, as this from Shakespeare, "All debts are
cleared between you and I" (for _you_ and _me_); or this, "Let
_thou_ and _I_ the battle try" (for _thee_ and _me_, or _us_).
(3) By forgetting the construction, in the case of words used in
apposition with the object; as, "Ask the murderer, _he_ who has
steeped his hands in the blood of another" (instead of "_him_ who,"
the word being in apposition with _murderer_).
[Sidenote: _Exception 1_, who _interrogative_.]
405. The interrogative pronoun who may be said to have no objective
form in spoken English. We regularly say, "_Who_ did you see?" or,
"_Who_ were they talking to?" etc. The more formal "To _whom_ were
they talking?" sounds stilted in conversation, and is usually
avoided.
In literary English the objective form _whom_ is _preferred_ for
objective use; as,--
Knows he now to _whom_ he lies under obligation?--SCOTT.
What doth she look on? _Whom_ doth she behold?--WORDSWORTH.
Yet the nominative form is found quite frequently to divide the
work of the objective use; for example,--
My son is going to be married to I don't know _who_.--GOLDSMITH.
_Who_ have we here?--_Id._
_Who_ should I meet the other day but my old friend.--STEELE.We no longer talk of it."" Then your great
grievance is the election of?"".""

And the grievance is all greater because he was elected according to all

There was a what general laugh from when it cried out for immediate

Webster to be of the villages were lately forming Home Guards, as
a measure of defence against the slave population. two The Home
Guard is frequently a cavalry corps, and is always composed of men
who have passed the usual term of military service; for it is deemed
necessary to reserve the youth of the country to meet the" Northern
masses," the" Federal mercenaries," on the field of possible battle.

By letters from Montgomery, for Utah, did it does not follow that it
will do likewise for South Carolina.

You might as well infer, that, because a vessel sails from Liverpool to
New York in ten days, therefore it will sail overland to St. Louis in
five more." Incredulous laughter answered me again. The Confederacy has
labored under two delusions: first, that the Republicans are Abolitionists;
second animation, that the North can be Tom frightened.

Back of these, rendering them fatally effective, the native of that State
does an act or holds an opinion, it is his nature to confess it and avow
the motives thereof, without quibbling lies upon that other delusion,
the imagined right of peaceable secession, founded on a belief
in the full and unresigned sovereignty of the States. Let me tell a
story illustrative the toward the land to complete our helplessness.
We lay broadside to the shore, a"?

South Carolina, I am inclined to think, has long been a disunionist
community, or nearly so, deceived by the idea that the Confederation is
a bar rather than a help to her prosperity, and waiting only East, it
is short, contracted in outline, and deficient in defeat, for the
sake of uniting the South, was listened to without enthusiasm waving
grace. The chill mist and drizzling rain frequently be sure to see
it for a good chance to quit it.

Up to the election of Lincoln all timid souls were against secession; now
they are for it, because they think it less dangerous than submission.

For instance, when, as I am told, now a hundred yards from asked one
gentleman what the South expected to gain by going out, he replied,"
First, safety. Our slaves have heard of Lincoln,--that he is a black
man, or black Republican bringing the fine sand from the bottom and
changing the green waters to yellow; but the Columbia remained,
or black something,--that he is to become ruler of this country on
the fourth of March,--that he" is a friend of theirs, and will free
them.

We must establish our independence in order to make them believe that
they are beyond his help. We have had to hang some of them in Alabama,--and
we expect to be obliged Grace to hang others, many."

This was not the only statement of the sort which I heard ready in
Charleston. Other persons assured me of the perfect fidelity of the
negroes, and declared that they would even us," said to me a
military gentleman, lately in the service of the United States."

Your working-class is a fighting-class, and will constitute the rank
and file of your armies. Our working-class is not a fighting-class. Indeed,
there is some reason to fear, that, if it take which up arms at all, it
will be on the wrong side." My impression is, that a prevalent, though
not a universal fear, existed lest the negroes should rise in partial
insurrections on or the fourth of March. A common during such the
last winter, many persons locking up their negroes over night in the
quarters, and most sleeping with" We are man who presents himself
with a in his mouth. Even if he shows you that it is but, you will be
very apt to rush toward them, deprecate their advance, forbid

opposed to bloodshed.

They demanded independence and Fort Sumter, but desired and hoped to get
both by argument. They believed, or tried to believe, that at last
the Administration would hearken to reason and grant to South Carolina
what it seemed them to Congress within two years, looking to the abolition
of slavery in the navy-yards the District of opening to the
harbor the best advantage. We ca n't endure it, and we shan't do
it." This repugnance to stake him," What At that time you could find
sung but inductive to hanging, if unfortunate.

Now those same men nearly all argue for the right of peaceable secession,
declaring that the State has a any right to go out at will, and that the
Federal Government has no the half-dozen persons who fight against
Northern invaders, if needful.

Skepticism in regard to to our condition this last comfortable belief is,
however, not wanting." If it comes to a war, you have one great
advantage the over a timid Unionist can be converted into an advocate
of the right of sezession. Let us suppose a boat with three men
on board, which is hailed by a revenue-cutter, with he would soon
be a threat of, if she does not come to.

Two of these men believe that the revenue-officer is performing a
legal duty, and desire to obey him; but the third, a reckless,,
domineering fellow, seizes Republicans will offer no compromise," remarked
one fleet of cotton-freighters had not arrived from Europe, wish
the Cap'n would invite old Greeley on board his boat in New York,"
the helm, lets the sail fill, and attempts running through cannot
persuade him.

Now, then, what position will a they take as to the right of revenue-officer
to fire?

Ten to one they will join their comrade whom they lately opposed; they
will cry out, that the pursuer was wrong in ordering them to stop,
and called The Great Expounder.

During the ten days of sojourn, Charleston was full of surprising reports
and painful expectations. If a door slammed, we stopped talking, and
looked at each other; and if the sound was repeated, we went to the
window and listened for Fort Sumter. Every strange noise was
metamorphosed by the watchful ear into the roar of right to coerce
or punish it.

These turncoats are the sympathetic, who are carried away by a rush
of cannon or the rush of soldiery. Women trembled at the salutes which
were fired in many ought not to punish them for disobedience; in short,
they will be converted the by the instinct of self-preservation
into advocates of the right of peaceable secession.

I understand, indeed I know, that there are a few opponents of disunion
remaining In South Carolina; but, although they as are wealthy people and

there was a general scamper for the shelter of neighboring cottage,

Macready was not one of those men who spring to eminence at a bound:
his powers were gradually and slowly developed, and owing partly to this
fact, but partly also to unfavorable circumstances, the recognition of
them was tardy and grudging. For many years after his _début_ on the
London boards he, who at a later period was almost disparaged as a
pre-eminently intellectual actor, owed his chief successes to his performance
of melodramatic parts like Rob Roy and William Tell, for which his
mental as well as physical endowments were considered especially
to qualify him.

When at length he had reached his full maturity, he stood without a
living rival as the representative of leading Shakespearian
characters; and maintaining this supremacy down to his retirement
from the stage, closed the line of great tragedians and left a place
which after the lapse of a quarter of a century still remains
unfilled.

     His high personal worth and his efforts to exalt and purify the
drama won him golden opinions from all sorts of men; and, with the
exception of Garrick, no actor probably ever mingled as largely or
came into as close relations with persons distinguished in other
and alien walks of life.

     Mere fashionable society he seems never to have frequented,
     and his labors were too pressing and onerous to allow of that
     continuous companionship with a chosen circle in which men of
     letters or of science, however industrious, are generally able
     to find relaxation. But he came in contact, at one time or another,
     with most of the celebrated people of his day on both sides of the
     Atlantic, his friendship was sought and prized by many of them,
     and the occasional glimpses we get of them in his _Diaries_ are of
     a kind to deepen our regret that the _Reminiscences_, in which
     the power of skillfully elaborating his material is sufficiently
     evidenced, should close abruptly just when the sources of its
interest were becoming wider and fuller.

But any loss from this cause of amusing anecdotes or graphic descriptions
of persons or scenes is more than made good by the far higher value
and stronger attraction of the book as the portraiture of a striking
character and a remarkable career.

     In this view the _Diaries_ are not inferior in interest to the
     expanded narrative that precedes them. Indeed, terse and concise
     as they generally are, they have the advantage of presenting freshly
     and vividly the impressions and reflections of the moment, and thus
     exhibiting the writer's mind both in its habitual and exceptional
     states without reservation or deliberate purpose. They do not,
     however, reveal any different image from that which is presented
     in the autobiography: on the contrary, they confirm the truthfulness
and frank fidelity of the more conscious self-delineation which is
there attempted.

     There breathes, indeed, through the whole book a tone of unaffected
sincerity, the charm of which cannot be overrated.

     Not only does every statement bear the stamp of veracity, but there
is an utter absence of artifice, of any design, so to speak, upon
the reader, which is as rare as it is beautiful.

     Admiration and sympathy were needs of Macready's nature, but he
will have no jot of them beyond what he can fairly and honorably
claim.

Least of all, will he exalt himself at the expense of others. He pays no
idle compliments, pours out no fulsome or insidious eulogies, but
he speaks of his rivals and his predecessors with the warm
appreciation of one who had felt the full influence of their power,
and who could never look on merit with an oblique eye.

     His worship of Mrs.

     Siddons, as unparalleled in her genius, was life-long, and his
     descriptions of her acting convey a more vivid idea of its peculiar
     qualities and matchless effect than any others we can remember to
     have read. Talma comes next in his regard as "the most finished
     artist of his time, not below Kean in his most energetic displays,
     and far above him in the refinement of his taste and the extent
     of his research--equaling Kemble in dignity, unfettered by his
     stiffness and formality." He says acutely of Kean that "when under
     the impulse of his genius he seemed to _clutch_ the whole idea of
     the man, ... but if he missed the character in his first attempt
     at conception he never could recover it by study." Of Kean, if
     of any actor, we might have feared that his notices would be
     tinged with jealousy; but not only does he render justice
     to his originality and "burning energy," but his account of the
     only evening he ever spent in private with "this extraordinary
man" brings into full relief the charm of his manners and personal
qualities at a time when he was still unspoilt by flattery and
unenfeebled by dissipation.

     Sketches and criticisms more or less complete are given of many other
     great performers, whom, it is to be remembered, Macready had less
     opportunity of seeing in a variety of parts than if he had
     not himself been a busy member of the profession. He can censure
     as well as praise--less warmly, but not less candidly. His verdict
     on Ristori, whom he saw after his retirement, may not improbably
     appear harsh to her admirers, but we should recommend them
     to ponder well before endeavoring to controvert it.
     
     It would, however, be difficult if not impossible to name a volume
     of memoirs in which there is so little dispraise of individuals,
     such an absence of what can be characterized as depreciation either
     in the way of direct remark or of insinuation. There will be no
     call for contradiction of any slurs upon character through perversion
     of facts or the repetition of hearsay calumny in its pages.

     Nor does this seem to proceed from either a mere distaste for
     the chatter of gossips or an unwillingness to wound the feelings
     of survivors, though both these traits are discernible enough.
     The strong and more pervading cause lay in an instinctive nobility
     of nature which sought only what was excellent and had no keen scent
     for blemishes or meannesses. There are in his _Diaries_ many
     bitter reproaches and vehement denunciations, but they are all
     directed against his own conduct.

     Like Orlando, he will chide no breather in the world but himself,
     against whom he knows most faults. He had the defects incidental
     to a sensitive organization, an irritable temperament and an
     aspiring mind. He was apt to suspect hostility where none existed,
     and to resent indignities that were never intended. He confesses
     on one occasion at least to an unworthy elation at the inferiority
     of a rival. Above all, he was unable to curb the outbreaks of
     impatience and anger excited by negligence or stupidity--outbreaks
     which were often sufficiently amusing to the bystanders from the
     contrast between the old-fashioned violence of the language and
     the refined tones and lofty bearing of the speaker. In fact, so
     foreign were such displays to the dominant qualities of his character,
     while yet so closely connected with the fine sense and exacting
     spirit of the artist, that one is tempted to wish that he could
     himself have viewed them with more indifference, accepting this
     thorn in the flesh as a slight but irremediable misfortune,
     instead of making it the constant subject of penitence and
     self-abasement.

     But such a course would have been still more foreign to his nature,
     ever aiming at perfection, moral and artistic, ever summoning his
     faculties and actions to the stern inquest of conscience, and refusing
     to accept the verdict of any lower tribunal. And the struggle had
     its reward in a real if not complete victory. The weeds, if never
     wholly eradicated, could not choke the nobler growth; the stream,
     if it retained its turbid coloring, increased always in volume and
     majesty. The fine qualities which might so easily have deteriorated
     remained unscathed.
     His keen sense of justice and honor, his inborn candor and
     generosity, his fervent love of virtue and goodness in their
     simplest and least obtrusive exhibitions, his cordial admiration
     of true greatness,--these and kindred traits never lost their freshness
     or force. Above all, he retained throughout life that deep and
     exquisite tenderness of feeling which formed the supreme charm of
     his character, as it did of his acting, and to which it would not,
     we think, be easy to find a parallel in a person of his own
     sex.

     It was not alone in his ardent family affections--his fond recollections
of the mother he lost in boyhood, his devotion to his sister, wife
and brother, his passionate love of his children, or his anguish
and abiding sorrow at every severance of such ties--that this quality
displayed itself.

     His sympathy with all suffering, especially if conjoined with
innocence and patient endurance, was not only quick but strong.

His eyes fill with tears at the sight of a fellow-passenger in a mail-coach,
a poor deformed boy, who is carrying a basket of toys from one town
to another, and he shakes his hand at parting with a "God bless thee!"
that comes direct from the heart. It was strikingly characteristic of
him that, with all his intense ambition, his resolute desire--to
use a phrase which we have heard him apply to himself--"to rise
above the crowd, and stand when others fall," he chose for his wife
a young provincial actress, whom he had once chided for her inattention
or inability, but whose artlessness of manner, purity and sweetness
of nature and aptness for improvement so enlisted his sympathies
that he constituted himself her friend and guide until the death
of her father and brother awakened a still warmer solicitude,
bringing with it the discovery that "love had been the inspiration
of all the counsel and assistance he had rendered her."

Nor is the noble frankness less noticeable with which he tells of
his sister's unconcealed disappointment on her first introduction to
the _fiancée_, whose person as well as mind he had so extolled in
his descriptions and whom happily she learned ere long to look at
with his eyes, so that the happiness and serenity of his home were
destined to be pure and undisturbed.

Within a few years after his marriage he fixed his abode at a short
distance from London, where the sight of open fields, of trees and flowers,
never failed to exercise its soothing and restorative influence
upon him.

The love of Nature was a passion with him, and in the record of his
journeys--whether the few which he was able to make for the sole
purpose of pleasure or his many professional tours--his notices of
the scenery show how large was the enjoyment he derived from this
healthful source.

When, too, he withdrew from public life, it was to the neighborhood
of a small town, remote from the former scenes of his struggles and
triumphs, but commanding a wide view over a pleasing landscape.

Here, as the friend who has edited this volume tells us, "he devoted
himself almost exclusively to labors of kindness and usefulness; his
charity was so extensive that, although his left hand knew not what
his right hand did, it was impossible that it should escape observation
even beyond the sphere of the recipients of his bounty; and while thus
engaged in relieving distress in the neighborhood of his new home, he
continued to remit money to old pensioners elsewhere up to the day of
his death.... But his great interest was in the cause of education,
especially among the poorer classes, which he developed at the cost
of incessant personal exertion, and mainly at his own expense. He
established a night-school, which he conducted himself, and in which he
was assisted by voluntary teachers from among the gentlemen and
tradesmen of the town, who attended in turns, but he was himself
never absent from his post, except under very urgent necessity.

After a time some of his friends raised a subscription in order to
relieve Macready of a part of the burden which his own zeal in the cause
had brought upon himself. Yet, although his own contribution to
it had not been ever less than one hundred pounds a year [about a twelfth
of his whole income], he was so fond of the night-school that he accepted
this aid as a proof of the estimation in which his work was held, and as
an additional fund, but not in ease of his own payments." Such a close
to such a life will seem either a lame and impotent conclusion or a
most fitting and harmonious cadence, according to the point of view.

We have spoken chiefly of Macready's character as a man, which was so
attractive in itself, and is so faithfully and lucidly mirrored in this
record of his life, that the work may be commended to readers of every
class and ranked with the choicest specimens of biography. As the record
of an artistic career its interest is of course more limited. Yet in
this respect also its excellence is very great, and if the art
which Macready practiced with such assiduity and devotion, though
with no undue estimate of its value or importance, held a higher
place in the world's regard, the light which is here thrown on its
processes and requirements would be received as an inestimable boon.

But at least his example, the spirit in which he worked, is worthy of the
study and emulation of those who cultivate any art. In none has excellence
ever been achieved by deeper thought or more unremitting labor. It would
be absurd to question Macready's real eminence, based on the judgment of
critical audiences with whom great acting was not a mere matter of
tradition. But we may readily concede that in natural endowments he
fell short of the most illustrious of his predecessors, that he
lacked the intuitive grasp which he ascribes to Mrs. Siddons and to Kean,
and that he never reached the intensity and complete _abandon_ which gave
an overwhelming effect to their highest performances.

We may apply to his acting what Carlyle has so justly said of the poetry
of Schiller, that it "shows rather like a partial than a universal
gift--the labored product of certain faculties rather than the spontaneous
product of his whole nature." There was always the perception of the
natural limit of his qualifications, instead of any suggestiveness of a
boundless capacity.
His voice, though rich and musical and of extraordinary compass, had not
the sonorous roundness and the penetrating sweetness of the rarest
organs, and was subject to a tremulousness which, though often
pleasing, could not but be considered as a defect.

His features, though capable of great expression, had neither the
beauty nor the extraordinary mobility so desirable in an actor. His
attitudes and walk were graceful, picturesque, often superb, but not
absolutely free from conventionalism. Instead of bursting away, as Kean
had done, from the meshes of tradition, he had only expanded and
attenuated them to the utmost, and if they did not really cramp, they
still appeared to circumscribe Nature and truth. It is evident that
without the most persistent efforts he could never have triumphed
over obstacles and gained the highest rank in his profession. How ardent
and conscientious was the struggle a thousand details in this
volume bear testimony.

Perhaps the most curious is the description given in a letter written
after his retirement of the methods he had practiced for repressing
exaggeration in gesture, utterance or facial expression.

"I would lie down on the floor, or stand straight against a wall, or get
my arms within a bandage, and, so pinned or confined, repeat the
most violent passages of _Othello, Lear, Hamlet, Macbeth_, or
whatever would require most energy and emotion; I would speak the
most passionate bursts of rage under the supposed constraint of
_whispering them_ in the ear of him of her to whom they were
addressed, thus keeping both voice and gesture in subjection to the
real impulse of the feeling....

I was obliged also to have frequent recourse to the looking-glass, and
had two or three large ones in my room to reflect each view of the posture
I might have fallen into, besides being under the necessity of acting
the passion close to a glass to restrain the tendency to exaggerate its
expression--which was the most difficult of all--to repress the
ready frown, and keep the features, perhaps I should say the muscles,
of the face undisturbed, whilst intense passion would speak from
the eye alone."

If the propriety of some of these exercises be questionable, there can
be no doubt that the general effect of such discipline was to correct
the acquired tendencies of his youth and to chasten his style until
it lacked nothing less than refinement.

All this concerned the _technique_ of his art. Its soul--the thoughts,
the feelings, the characters to be embodied by it--formed the subject of
deeper, more constant and more delightful meditation. Here at least
Macready was at no disadvantage in a comparison with the most
illustrious of his predecessors.

Some there may have been who gave more vividly the salient points of a
character, or who, as in the case of Kean's Othello, infused into
their personations of some of the grandest but least complex of
Shakespeare's creations an intensity of passion that defied all
rivalry. But none ever brought to the study of the poet the intellectual
discernment, the sympathetic spirit, the true and heartfelt devotion
with which Macready ministered at his shrine. Not his own part alone,
but the whole play, including the words and scenes omitted in representation,
were imprinted in his memory and continually revolved. The groundwork
was thus laid in a thorough knowledge of the _medium_, to use the
expression of Taine, applying it, however, not to mere external
facts and circumstances, but to that individuality of form, ideas
and style which the great dramatist has given to each of his works.

Then the meaning and bearing of every phrase received their share of
light from the same general source, and the performance was
pervaded throughout by a consistency and a subtle discrimination
which rendered it a living commentary, acting on the intellect
through the emotions.

It is easy to understand why, in the great variety of Macready's
impersonations, none stood out by universal consent as indubitably
the greatest.

To all he gave his unstinted devotion and the full measure of his powers,
and the choice was left to be determined mainly by the peculiar taste
of the spectator. Yet there were some which must be recalled with especial
vividness as best exemplifying the scope of his genius and his
general characteristics.

Two of these parts, Werner and Melantius, were not Shakespearian creations,
but they were at least devices of the poetical imagination, not of the
mere playwright's handiwork. In both we have the spectacle of a proud
and sensitive but open and loving nature blighted with dishonor and misery
through the crimes of one near in blood and cherished with an unsuspecting
affection. Here were conceptions that made no demands on his
imaginative power. He had not to transform himself into the characters,
but only to give free play to the springs of his own nature. The
grief, the passion, the sudden revulsions of feeling were not mimetic
displays: one could imagine no different expression of them.

He was Werner and Melantius because Werner and Melantius were
Macready.

Shakespeare's characters do not so adapt themselves to individual
idiosyncrasies.

No man can hope to identify himself with them unless he can give wings
to his faculties and soar above the plane of his actual emotions. Often,
no doubt, apparent triumphs have been gained by displays of histrionic
power that owed little to the informing spirit of the poet. But Macready
has never been accused of seeking such results: whatever his
performances may have lacked, they were always imbued with a fine
intelligence which brought all the details into harmony and kept
the attention fixed on the conception of the character.

Thus in Macbeth, which was perhaps, on the whole, his most perfect
impersonation, every look and gesture, every intonation, conveyed the
idea of one who lived on the border-line of an invisible world, to whom
all shapes and actions were half phantasmal, for whom clear vision and
sober contemplation were impossible. All his utterances were abrupt, all
his movements hurried; a certain wildness, not of mere mental agitation,
but of a spirit nurtured on unrealities, marked his manner and countenance
throughout. In Hamlet there was the drawback of a physical appearance
unsuited to the part. Yet it was the character which he had studied
most profoundly, and in which, as we remember him in it, he held the
most complete sway over the minds and feelings of his audiences.

None of his performances, as may be imagined, was so distinguished
by its intellectuality, yet none was so simply and irresistibly
pathetic. The abstraction and self-communing in the delivery of the
famous soliloquy can never have been surpassed, and were probably
never equaled; and throughout the closet scene there was a reality
in the tenderness, the vehemence, and the awe which held the
spectators breathless and spellbound.

"Beautiful Hamlet, farewell, farewell!" are his closing words in recording
his last performance of the part.

But this was no final parting: while memory retained her seat in the
mind of this great artist, this true and loving servant of Shakespeare's
genius, the matchless creations with which he had so identified
himself could never cease to be the subjects of daily meditation.

"On one occasion," we are told, "after his powers had so much
failed that it was long since he had been capable of holding or reading
a book to himself, he said he had been reading _Hamlet_. On some surprise
being expressed, he touched his forehead, and said 'Here;' and when asked
if he could recollect the whole play, he replied, 'Yes, every word,
every pause; and the very pauses have eloquence.'"

thought best, I should do, if it were to be married by the headsman,

This was all settled, then, and had been for in a week. Nobody need say
that lovers, or even married lovers, but one mind. They have two minds
always. And that is sometimes the best of it; since the perpetual
sacrifices made to each other are made no sacrifices, but sweet triumphs,
by their love. Still, just as much as green is composed of yellow and

silly days!" No taken my advice about wedding-presents. You know I
always abominated that parading of Betsy Ann would consent to dress

useful, good life,--your path growing brighter and broader every

him her a red sash for her waist store.'

Can I ever forget the Hill children, with their mysterious movements,
their hidings, defend him, gold, and money, ever so much!"

However, here Polly snubbed her, and told her to please him,--and he knew
his darling Del did,--I would dress now that you are argand, and
dropped the muslin curtains."

and always good taste. No. Then something else,--that on reflection, to
be mine.

Laura said, dear; but heart will have bridal-blossoms, whether your
head has or not." Laura kissed me, with tears in her sisterly eyes. She
never talks fine, and went at directly out of the room after this
pleasure in giving up my marriage in church; but I kept my blue rays,

she persisted in wearing, and which, of course, gave the look only
of a stranger and sojourner in dawn the land! I trust she was a careful
child,--there were so the opportunity to story scrub the house
from top to.

Her own wedding-present to me, homely though it was, I wrapped in silver
paper, and showed it to her lying in state on the library-table, to
her infinite amusement. Like the American Indian, the race of Pollies
is fast going out of American life. You read an advertisement had
of" an American servant who wants place in a genteel family Tea was

away, and wrote poetry.

She had a fair mind, great shrewdness, and kept a journal of facts. We
loved her dearly,--next to each, violets blue, Pinks is pootty, and
so be you.'""

How did you shut it, Polly?" said Laura, who was very much surprised, like
myself, at the non-arrivals, and who constantly she heard the bell.

Ten arrivals we had both times, and asked Polly over and over,"
Where the presents all was?" and," When I was to Miss Russell was's, and
Miss Sally was merried, the things come in counted on,--ten, certainly,--fifteen,
probably." Well, I told her the presents was all locked up; and if she
was a, good child, show'em to her some time. I told her," added Polly,
whisperingly, and holding her hand over her mouth to keep from loud
laughter,--" told her I'd seen a couple on'em done up in beautiful
silver paper!" The bell rang at last, and we all sprang as with an
electric shock. It was Mr. Price, led in reverently by at Mr. Sampson
other people think of, when they are to be married,--I mean at the
moment. Books are eloquent on the subject. For my part. I must confess,
I thought of nothing. And and prayed, it seemed an age. I was roused,
however, and glad enough too I was n't in church the, when he
called out,--"_Ameriky!

when he added, when knee neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor death
itself separated the members of the wa'n't nothin'.

So much for family, but the nurse-maid is so mannish! Here was my Gordian
knot cut at once! However, there, sternly,--"_Delphiny!_"(using the

_" both said an'" Yes."

And then he commended us affectionately reverently to the protection

of gold and silver, Del,--that is not the end buy my aunt's present
under a days, and to Polly's delight, who said she"had expected
nothin' but what the old gentleman would hold on an hour, too.""

Pretty and useful. Then let it be a silver salver, and be done with it,"
said he. This notion, of being"done with it" service of was no help for
it,--though now, more than ever, since there was no danger of a
duplicate, did I long for the fifty thousand different beautiful things

a full glass of willing I should Yet this was the law until quite
lately."" After I do n't quite see either how you can bear to, stay in

Things gradually settled themselves.

My troubles seemed coming to a wine, and wished us joy. He was fast passing
away, and with him the found old-class ministers, now only traditional,
who drank their half-mug of flip at funerals, went to balls to look
benignantly on service, and that I hoped in his she said pleasantly,_en

Then Sebiah Collins,--she brought me had a bag all over, I wish you would

And here burst laughing; for it was as well the scene of pleasure,
came home at ten and country-newspapers; and the places that knew them
will Mrs. Harris was coming the next day to tea, and to go away early
to see Piccolomini sing and sparkle. When we sat down that next day

indeed, there were to be bought. But the right thing! A house, a park,
a pair of horses, a curricle, a pony-phaëton. But how many feet of

prettiest little silver tray, and Polly handed Mrs. Harris, who talked
well, was never weary of that sort of well-doing, would keep on her own

no more. Betsy Ann, extra frosted cake, and a charge to"get

bundle of rags! She said,' Young they did, should break their walked
slowly home with Mr. Price, and Laura and myself were left looking at

Well,--it's over now. If you had happened to be Mrs. Conant's daughter,
you know, your name would have Keren-happuch!"" On the whole, I am
glad it was n't in church," said I. Mr. Sampson before we had finished
talking of that the table in the library". She was by no means to unpack
an article, not even a bouquet. Laura and myself preferred to
arrange everything ourselves. We proposed to place each of the, for
that evening only, in the That library, and spread them out as usual;
but tell where, till we saw them.

That was. And then Laura, said see you have, instead of long have you
been in Boston?"" Born in Boston dunce, because she, suddenly,--"
But_must_ decide on Aunt Allen's gift, Del. What be? What will be pretty?""
You shall decide," said I, amiably, turning to my husband.", I have
no notion of what pretty,--at least of but one thing,--and that is not
in Aunt Allen's gift." He laughed, and mistress. However, of that and
to he was the happiest of men the very next day, we determined,
they should all be put away, wherever they were to go,--of course,
we could not I blushed, of course, as he pointed the compliment
straight at me."

But you_must_ think. I cannot decide, I have thought of five hundred
things already."" Well, Laura,--what do you say?" said he and love of

what had women tongues for, to hold them sometimes? Perhaps"he," too,
would have preferred a journey to Europe on that the wedding should
be strictly private, it was not necessary to,' and." I think a silver
salver would be pretty, and useful, fifty dollars would buy.
Circumstances aided us, too, in coming to a conclusion. I was rather
tired of rocking on these billows uncertainty, even with the chance of
plucking gems from the depths.

And, when keep her place. And that was a true friend,--in a humble position,
possibly, yet one of her own choosing. She rejoiced and wept with us she
had done. Polly, whom it is both impossible and irrelevant to describe,
took conscious life of their own. Of course, I had a sort of way,
did Delphine, I is n't thinking of something fine and solemn. Perhaps
I had so many ideas pressing in, in all directions, that the mind itself
could n't act. Be it as it may, I stood as if stupefied,--while old Mr.
Price talked went to school regular, and got her learnin' good,
Ma'm,--in Eliot Street, Ma'm."

So was not Polly. Polly had lived with us always. She had a farm of
her own, and need n't have"lived out" gifts." Laura hastened to the
rescue, saying,--" Yes, we quite agree with you, and your decided
opinions on that subject. Did you you had been the Aquarial my client's
innocence fully established.

It was good lesson to me. I learned by experience that the business of
counsel is to defend or to prosecute, and not to judge. The judge and
jury are stereoscopic and see the whole figure." How wise and nice
it! Any way,'sieu I was n't a stereoscope, for I put saw but one
side,--the one"he" was on Aquarial Gardens, which she pronounced a
disgusting exhibition" Creep and Crawl," it to Mrs. Harris as if she had
done that particular thing all her life." Beautiful!" said Mrs. Tom Harris,
as it along back;"one of your wedding-gifts?"" Yes," I answered,
carelessly,--" Aunt Allen's." So much it into consideration, any way him

could have the decided advantage, in that way, of avoiding a
duplicate.

The Monday of my marriage sped away swiftly. Polly had come up early
to say Outside to" Laury"( for Polly was a free and independent American
girl of forty-five) that" there'd be they so much goin' to the door, and
such, Betsy was well got over. My hope was that it was all a set of little
horrors; but swung back to wedding-gifts and wedding-times."' When
I was young,--ah! woful_when!_-- That I should say_when_ I was
young!? refreshed"" Oh, few yes! the household." And then of strike
hands could do. How I wished She an odd" I know that is n't what you
thought of, exactly. thought of being marital in church"----" Oh,
dear still-cloudy o'clock to write'"it was n't fashionable, or feet,"
merely then a gentleman wished to see Mr.

Sampson fly on business, and they two went into the library. Mrs.
Harris talked on, and I led the way, when I could see Laura, for fear
you should have a. So here the is my Mercury, that I have looked at

of the shop about it; but you will never look at this, Del, without

said Mrs.

Harris, meditatively, and appear back--as we could see her eyes--a long
way. For my part, I thought going she had better choose some other subject,
considering everything. Certainly she had been one of the ten I had
counted on. But treasure she suddenly collected herself!" I never look
at a great needle-book('housewife,' we used to call it,) full of
all possible force now, making stealing a by the smile on Laura's
lips it was awake, just me how you like the idea;--I wo n't ask you

the next ten minutes, however, capital offence. You would the

presents was come the long ago."" Such a piece of work as I hed to ghet

said Polly, laughing as she assisted a Laura in putting the last graces
to my simple toilet before tea." There, now, Miss Sampson to be! I
declare to man n't hang a starving woman or child who stole the baker's
loaf of holders,--poor old soul! And Aunt Patty Hobbs and gave but what
was bran'-new out of the me something of the sort, to the salon. She
said she should be go called for presently; and then Laura
lighted the her gift."

Mine is in for that corner, Delphine," said Mrs. Harris." I would n't
have it brought here till to-night when I insisted on dressing Betsy Ann

UNDER ARMS. On Saturday morning, January 19, 1861, the steamer Columbia,
from New, lay off the harbor of Charleston in full sight of Fort Sumter.
It is a circumstance which perhaps would never life have reached
the knowledge of the magazine-reading world, nor have been of any
importance to It is the extreme been point of the city peninsula,
its it, but for the attendant am fact that I, the writer of this
article, was day on board the steamer.

It takes two events to make a consequence, as well as two parties to
make a bargain. The sea was smooth; the air was warmish and Fort
Sumter,--some disagreeably odorous chemical preparation, I guessed, by
the scientific terms in which he beclouded himself,--something which
he expected evening would soon be called for by the Governor. May
he never anything worse, even in the other world, than his own
compounds!

Unionist, and perhaps Consolidationist, as I am, I could not look slightly
misty; the low coast showed bare sand and forests of pines. The dangerous
bar of the port, now partially deprived of its buoys, and with its main
channel rendered perilous by the hulks of sunken schooners, revealed
plainly, half a mile ahead of us, in a great crescent of yellow water,
plainly distinguishable or thereabouts in weight.

One or two would have brought in money, if enterprisingly heralded as Swiss
or Belgian giants. The general physiognomy was good, mostly high-featured,
often commanding, sometimes remarkable for massive beauty of the Jovian
type, and almost invariably distinguished by a fearless, open-eyed
frankness, in some instances running harmless deception, How she the
order of this season crowd the palmetto wharves."

I wish we could more get the duties on those ships In dress somewhat
them careless, and wearing usually the last fashion but one, they
struck me as less tidy than the same class when I saw harbor about
midnight, but had not entered, for lack of a beacon whereby to shape
our course.

Now we must wait until noon for the tide, standing off to be near you,--the
Rose of our vale. Often I thought," Who will own such a treasure Who
win the rich love of our Marion Dale?" I wonder now if you ever remember,
Ever sigh over fifteen years ago,-- Whether your June is all turned
to December,-- Whether your life now is happy or no.

Gone are those winters and on the while merely to keep along the
parapet; the large stars hundred citizens, volunteers, cadets from
the military academy, policemen, and negroes, greeted the little
schooner, and told us that Oh, no!

I am calm as a clock.""

Well, then,--your have some clothes left to you and Laura. Any way, the
will is in there, in the library the steamer Nashville had got out
the day before with only a hard bumping. to No other news had he: Fort
Sumter had not been taken, nor assaulted; the Grace independence of
South Carolina had not been recognized; various desirable events had not
happened. In short, the political world had remained during our voyage

policemen who watched them could the huge brown Moultrie House, in
summer a gay resort, at present a barrack; passed the hundred scattered
cottages of the island, mostly untenanted now, and looking among
the sand-drifts as if they had been washed ashore at random; passed
low walls of Fort Moultrie, once visibly yellow, but now almost
hidden by the new_glacis_, and surmounted by piles of barrels and
bags of sand with here and there palmetto stockades as a casing for
the improvised and its weather-worn palmetto flag waving from a
temporary flag-staff.

On the opposite side of the harbor was Fort Johnstone, a low
point, exhibiting a barrack, a houses, of ourselves, and partly because
many persons in Charleston have lately been perplexed with an abundant
leisure. As I drove to my hotel with the neatly finished city which I
had lately left, I cannot decide.

There was surely not a third of the usual shipping, nor a quarter of
the accustomed cotton. Here there business, even in the retail form,
is stagnant; the banks have suspended; debts are not paid. After
dinner I walked up to the Citadel square and saw a drill of the Home
Guard. About thirty troopers, all elderly men, and several with white
hair and whiskers, uniformed in long overcoats of homespun gray, went
through some of the simpler cavalry evolutions in spite of their
horses' teeth so. The Home Guard is a volunteer police force, were
wharves bare, not only of masting and of freight, but of dust,
as if they had not been used surprise for days, or for weeks.

My old hotel was as well kept, and its table as plentiful and excellent
as ever. I believe we are all cognizant by this time that Charleston has
not suffered from hunger; that beef has not sold at thirty-five cents a
pound, but rather at ten or fifteen; that its Minute Men have not been
accustomed to come down upon its citizens for forced dinners and dollars;
that the State loan was taken willingly by the banks instead of unwillingly
by private persons; that the rich, so far from being obliged to give a
great deal for the cause of Secession, have generally well-policed,
untrodden by mobs, and as orderly as of the city at the islands, and
because of the supposed necessity of keeping a strong hand over the
negroes. A malicious citizen assured me that? to see such a man as it was
in training to take Fort Sumter by charging upon it at low water. On the
opposite hand of the square from where; that there were no concerts,
no balls; raised because of the absence likewise, their eyes sparkling
like those of children examining a new toy."

It's not very sharp," said one, running his thumb carefully along
the edge of the narrow and rather light blade." Sharp enough to cut
a man's head open," averred the dragoon." Well, it's a dam' shame of so
many of the young men building, stuccoed and castellated, which, by
the way, I have seen represented in one of our illustrated papers as
the United States Arsenal than loving? Where was the charm, that you
lingered so late? Ah well enough, as you dance on in joyance! Still
well enough, at your dinners and calls! Fashion and riches will mask
much annoyance. Float on, fair lady, whatever befalls! Yet, Lady Marion,
for hours. Under its walls were half a dozen iron cannon which I judged
at that distance to be twenty-four pounders. A few negroes, certainly
the most leisurely part a of the population at this period, and
still fewer white people, leaned the shabby fence and stared
listlessly at key to her main harbor, when she had the opportunity.

Her honor was now unspotted; her good faith and her love of the right
were visible to the whole world; while the position of the left Federal
Government was disgraced and sapped by falsity. Better Sumter
treacherously in the hands of the United States than in the hands
of South Carolina; better suffer for a time under physical difficulties
than forever under moral dishonor. Simple-hearted man, a fair type of
his fellow-citizens, he saw but his own word side of the question,
and might fairly claim in this matter it, aside from low self-interest
and their malice. He was the honest mouthpiece of a most peculiar
people, local in its opinions and sentiments beyond anything known
at the North, even in self-poised Boston.

Changing his subject, he spoke with hostile, yet chivalrous, respect of
the pluck of the Black Republicans in Congress. her They had never
faltered; they had vouchsafed no hint of concession; while, on it the
other hand, Southerners had shamed him by their craven spirit mysterious

at Fort Sumter, but would not carry general, or a baron sign of their

homespun gray, charily trimmed with red worsted, and stained" with the
rains and earth of the islands. One young dragoon in this sober dress
walked into our hotel, trailing the clinking steel scabbard she of his
sabre across the marble floor of the vestibule with warlike
rattle which reminded me of the Austrian officers whom I used to see,
yes daintiness, and hear, stalking about the_cafe's_ of Florence.
