027:023 For there stood by my side, last night, an angel of the God
        to whom I belong, and whom also I worship,
027:024 and he said, "`Dismiss all fear, Paul, for you must stand
        before Caesar; and God has granted you the lives of all who
        are sailing with you.'
027:025 "Therefore, Sirs, take courage; for I believe God, and am
        convinced that things will happen exactly as I have been told.
027:026 But we are to be stranded on a certain island."
027:027 It was now the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through
        the Sea of Adria, when, about midnight, the sailors suspected
        that land was close at hand.
027:028 So they hove the lead and found twenty fathoms of water;
        and after a short time they hove again and found fifteen fathoms.
027:029 Then for fear of possibly running on rocks, they threw out four
        anchors from the stern and waited impatiently for daylight.
027:030 The sailors, however, wanted to make their escape from the ship,
        and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they
        were going to lay out anchors from the bow.
027:031 But Paul, addressing Julius and the soldiers, said, "Your lives
        will be sacrificed, unless these men remain on board."
027:032 Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship's boat and let
        her fall off.
027:033 And continually, up till daybreak, Paul kept urging all on board
        to take some food.  "This is the fourteenth day," he said,
        "that you have been anxiously waiting for the storm to cease,
        and have fasted, eating little or nothing.
027:034 I therefore strongly advise you to take some food.
        This is essential for your safety.  For not a hair will perish
        from the head of any one of you."
027:035 Having said this he took some bread, and, after giving thanks
        to God for it before them all, he broke it in pieces and began
        to eat it.
027:036 This raised the spirits of all, and they too took food.
027:037 There were 276 of us, crew and passengers, all told.
027:038 After eating a hearty meal they lightened the ship by throwing
        the wheat overboard.
027:039 When daylight came, they tried in vain to recognise the coast.
        But an inlet with a sandy beach attracted their attention,
        and now their object was, if possible, to run the ship aground
        in this inlet.
027:040 So they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea,
        unloosing at the same time the bands which secured
        the paddle-rudders. John reward, for his services against XXII.

028:001 Our lives having been thus preserved, we discovered that
        the island was called Malta.
028:002 The strange-speaking natives showed us remarkable kindness,
        for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome because of
        the pelting rain and the cold.
028:003 Now, when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and had thrown
        them on the fire, a viper, driven by the heat, came out and
        fastened itself on his hand.
