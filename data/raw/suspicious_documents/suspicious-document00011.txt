   XXXIII. And does not this involve that we hold the two former to be the
more righteous in a broad sense of the word?

    I dare not say that we owe no benefits to the Jewish nation, I do
not feel sure whether we do or do not, but I can see no good thing
that I can point to as a notoriously Hebrew contribution to our
moral and intellectual well-being as I can point to our law and say
that it is Roman, or to our fine arts and say that they are based
on what the Greeks and Italians taught us.

     On the contrary, if asked what feature of post-Christian life we
had derived most distinctly from Hebrew sources I should say at
once "intolerance"--the desire to dogmatise about matters whereon
the Greek and Roman held certainty to be at once unimportant and
unattainable.

    This, with all its train of bloodshed and family disunion, is
chargeable to the Jewish rather than to any other account.

   There is yet another vice which occurs readily to any one who reckons
up the characteristics which we derive mainly from the Jews; it is
one that we call, after a Jewish sect, "Pharisaism."

  I do not mean to say that no Greek or Roman was ever a sanctimonious
hypocrite, still, sanctimoniousness does not readily enter into our
notions of Greeks and Romans and it does so enter into our notions
of the old Hebrews.

    Of course, we are all of us sanctimonious sometimes; Horace himself
is so when he talks about aurum irrepertum et sic melius situm, and
as for Virgil he was a prig, pure and simple; still, on the whole,
sanctimoniousness was not a Greek and Roman vice and it was a Hebrew
one.

       True, they stoned their prophets freely; but these are not the
Hebrews to whom Mr.

      Arnold is referring, they are the ones whom it is the custom to
leave out of sight and out of mind as far as possible, so that they
should hardly count as Hebrews at all, and none of our characteristics
should be ascribed to them.

     Taking their literature I cannot see that it deserves the praises
that have been lavished upon it.

    The Song of Solomon and the book of Esther are the most interesting
in the Old Testament, but these are the very ones that make the
smallest pretensions to holiness, and even these are neither of
them of very transcendent merit.

They would stand no chance of being accepted by Messrs.

Cassell and Co. or by any biblical publisher of the present day. Chatto
and Windus might take the Song of Solomon, but, with this exception, I
doubt if there is a publisher in London who would give a guinea for
the pair.
Ecclesiastes contains some fine things but is strongly tinged with
pessimism, cynicism and affectation.

Some of the Proverbs are good, but not many of them are in common
use. Job contains some fine passages, and so do some of the
Psalms; but the Psalms generally are poor and, for the most part,
querulous, spiteful and introspective into the bargain. Mudie would not
take thirteen copies of the lot if they were to appear now for the first
time--unless indeed their royal authorship were to arouse an adventitious
interest in them, or unless the author were a rich man who played
his cards judiciously with the reviewers.

Dear, dear Dicky! If I talked a hundred years I could not express the
difference between us in any better fashion. He is "Dicky" and I am
"Margaret."

He is downstairs now in the smoking room, impatiently humoring this
lifelong habit of mine to have one hour of the day all to myself.

My mother taught me this when I was a tiny girl. My "thinking hour,"
she called it, a time when I solved my small problems or pondered my
baby sins. All my life I have kept up the practice. And now I am going
to devote it to another request of the little mother who went away
from me forever last year.

The price of a kitten before it could see, was fixed at one penny;
till proof could be given of its having caught a mouse, two-pence;
after which it was rated at four-pence, a great sum in those days,
when the value of specie was extremely high. It was likewise required,
that the animal should be perfect in its senses of hearing and seeing,
should be a good mouser, have its claws whole, and if a female, be
a careful nurse. If it failed in any of these qualifications, the
seller was to forfeit to the buyer the third part of its value. If
any one should steal or kill the cat that guarded the prince's
granary, the offender was to forfeit either a milch ewe, her fleece,
and lamb, or as much wheat as when poured on the cat suspended by
its tail, (its head touching the floor) would form a heap high
enough to cover the tip of the tail.

From these circumstances (says Pennant) we may conclude that cats were
not originally natives of these islands, and from the great care
taken to improve and preserve the breed of this prolific creature,
we may with propriety suppose that they were but little known at that
period.

When Mr. Baumgarten was at Damascus, he saw there a kind of hospital
for cats; the house in which they were kept was very large, walled
round, and was said to be quite full of them.

On inquiring into the origin of this singular institution, he was told
that Mahomet, when he once lived there, brought with him a cat,
which he kept in the sleeve of his gown, and carefully fed with his
own hands.

His followers in this place, therefore, ever afterwards paid a
superstitious respect to these animals; and supported them in
this manner by public alms, which were very adequate to the purpose.
Browne, in his _History of Jamaica_, tells us, "A cat is a very
dainty dish among the negroes."

ST. DUNSTAN'S, FLEET STREET.

_(To the Editor of the Mirror.)_

In your account of this church, in No. 388, I perceive you state that
the clock and figures were put up in 1761, whereas I find by
reference to works on this subject, that they were so placed in
1671.[1] 
[1] Occasioned by a transposition of figures.

In vol. xi.
referred to in the above page, the date stands 1671.

There are many curious monuments in this church, and among others,
is the beautiful one to the memory of Sir Richard Hoare, Knt. who was
Lord Mayor of London in the memorable year 1745, at which "alarming
crisis," in the words of the inscription, "he discharged the great
trust reposed in him with honour and integrity, to the approbation
of his sovereign and the universal satisfaction of his fellow
citizens."

He died in 1754, and was buried in this church. The monument, which
is of marble, consists of a sarcophagus, above which is a cherub
in the act of crowning a beautiful bust of Sir Richard with a laurel
wreath, above is a shield of arms, within an orb ar. sa. a spread eagle
of the first bearing an escutcheon of pretence ar. a lion ppr. in
chief in base a chev. gu. charged with three escallop shells of the
first, impaling a saltire sa. between four crosses fitche of the
same.

Crest, a griffin's head erased ar.

An inscription on the base informs us the monument was restored in
1820, at the expense of the parish, "in testimony of their grateful
sense of obligation to a family whose eminent virtue and munificence
it is intended to perpetuate."

In the vestry of this church is preserved a finely executed portrait of
the "Virgin Queen," in stained glass; and there is also another window
consisting of the effigy of St. Matthias, but this is not to be
compared with the other for execution.

CONSTANTINOPLE.

_(For the Mirror.)_

One of the finest buildings in Constantinople is a fountain in an open
square, near the seraglio gate; it is a place built and maintained
by the Grand Vizier, for the people to come and draw water, who
have it served out to them in great jugs by people who are constantly
in attendance to fill them; the jugs are chained to the place, and
stand in rows about four feet from the ground, between gilt iron
bars in front of the building.

There are men always ready inside to draw the water and fill the jugs,
which till people come are kept full; these men receive a yearly
salary.

The houses are chiefly built of wood, and reach so far over the top
that in some of the streets it would be very possible to get from
the windows of one house to another across the street.

By this manner of building, any one who has seen the place will not
wonder at the frequent and fatal conflagrations there, for if once
a fire break out it must burn till it comes to some garden or large
vacant place to stop at.

The Bussard is the most regular part of the city, and has a number
of parallel streets crossing one another, and covered at the top
with planks which keep out the rain and sun. Here all the richest and
finest goods in Constantinople are put out to show, as a pattern
or sample of the merchants' stock, for sale in their warehouses at
home.

Every street has its particular trade, so that there is no mixture of
shops as in other capitals. One street is occupied by goldsmiths,
another by silk and brocade merchants; grocers and tailors have
also different streets to themselves.

The city is always shut up at ten at night, so that no one can have
entrance or get out after that time. Indeed there is scarcely any
one in the streets after dusk, for every one then goes to rest,
so that when daylight is gone no business can be transacted; but
the people are obliged to pray every night one hour and a half
after dark, when the priests go up into the towers of the mosques,
and in a loud voice call crowds to prayers in these words:--"God
is great; (three times) give testimony there is but one God, yield
yourselves to his mercy, and pray to him to forgive your sins.

God is great (three times more) there is no other God but God."

THE NOVELIST.

THE BACHELOR'S REVENGE.

_(For the Mirror.)_

Mr.

Hardingham, or as some of his very intimate friends used to
call him, Jack Hardingham, lived in a dull looking house in ----
Square, his profession (the law) was dull, his fire and fireside
were dull; and as he sat by the former one dull evening, in the
dullest of all his dull humours, and of such the lonely bachelor
had many, he sighed, kicked his shins, and looked into his books;
but as that was like gazing upon a very ugly face, he shut them
again, and rang the bell.

It was answered by a portly dame, whose age might be about some four
or five and forty, whose complexion was fair, whose chubby cheeks
were brilliantly rosy, and whose black eyes were so vividly lustrous,
that one might have fancied the delicate cap-border near them, in
danger from their fire.

Over her full-formed bust, she wore a clear, and stiffly-starched
muslin habit-shirt of purest white, a beautiful lace-edged ruff
around her throat, over her ample shoulders was thrown a fawn-coloured
shawl, and she wore also, a silver gray gown of the material called
Norwich crape, with an apron rivalling in whiteness cap, habit-shirt,
and ruff.

We are particular in describing the costume of this fair creature,
because when _dress_ is invariably the same, it has unity with _person_;
it is identified with its wearer, and our affections even are
caught and retained by it, in a manner of which few are aware.

On the exterior of the lady whom we have endeavoured to portray,
"housekeeper" was as indelibly stamped as the effigy of our king on
the coin of the realm; and in a most soft and insinuating tone,
she said, "Would you be pleased to want any thing, sir?"

"Yes, Mrs. Honeydew--go and ask if they can't let me have De Vere."
"Yes, sir."

"Or the Chronicles of the Canongate."
"Yes, sir."
"Or Anne of Geierstein."

"Yes, sir."
"Or the Loves of the Poets."

"Yes, sir."
"Or, d'ye hear, hang it, tell Mr.

Mason there are seven or eight other new works, the names of which I
have forgotten, and he must recollect."
"Certainly, sir."

"Stop, stop--don't be in such a hurry--tell him, he has never ordered
for me the Quarterly, as I desired--that I want to see the United
Service Journal, and Blackwood for the month; and that if he chooses
to charge four pence a night for his new novels, I'll not read one
of them."

"Of course, sir; I'll tell him, for 'tis a shame, a real shame, for any
body to _repose_ on, as one may say, a gentleman like yourself. Never
fear, but I'll tell him."
The lady retired, the door closed, and Mr. Hardingham sighed, "A worthy
creature is Martha Honeydew." "Come in," cried the gentleman in a
most amiable tone, as he presently recognised his housekeeper's tap
at the parlour door, and with a curtsey she entered.

"O law, law! Mr. Hardingham, sir--Mr. Mason says--but I don't like
to give you all his message, indeed I don't--Mr.

Mason says--but I hope you'll never send me on such an _arrant_ again--he
says, sir--O but I'm sorry for it, that I am--he says then, that the
_Quarter_ you _ax'd_ for, ar'n't come yet, and there's time enough
for you to read it in when it _do_; that the Blackwood and the
Officers' Magazine are _hout_; that you may go without your new
novels afore he'll let you have 'em _chaiper_ than other folks,
(and there's a shocking shame, sir!)

and as for the works you mentioned, there's fifty new ones at least to
choose from; but he can't remember what you don't be pleased to
recollect yourself.

Dear heart! to think of a gentleman like you, sir, being _trated_
thus; why, my blood _biled_ within me; and I wouldn't demean myself to
bring back any thing for you from that place; but I took the
liberty, sir, to get you 'Damon and Dorinda,' a sweet pretty thing,
from another."

"Ah!" sighed the bachelor, "I see there's nobody in this world cares
for poor Jack Hardingham, but Martha Honeydew;" and he felt sorry that
his housekeeper had departed ere his lips had emitted this grateful
praise.

Yes, Mr. Hardingham felt vexed he scarcely knew why; and uncommonly
discontented he knew not wherefore; but had he troubled himself to
analyze such feelings, he would have discerned their origin to be
solitude and idleness. Mrs.

Honeydew brought tea; she had buttered a couple of muffins superlatively
well; and making her master's fire burn exceedingly bright, placed
them on the cat before it, and a kettle, which immediately commenced a
delicate bravura, upon the glowing coals; then, modestly waiting
at the distance of a few paces from her master until the water quite
boiled, she fixed her brilliant eyes upon his countenance with an
expression _intended_ to be _piteous_.

"Mrs. Honeydew--Martha," said Hardingham in a low querulous tone, "I
fancy I'm going to have a fit of the gout, or a bilious fever."
"_Fancy_, indeed, sir; why, I never saw you looking haler."
"Ay, Ay, so much the worse; a fit of apoplexy then maybe."
"Lauk, lauk!

sir; a fit of the blue devils more likely. How can you talk so? A fit
of _perplexity_! Dear, dear! how some men do go on to be sure;" pouring
the steaming water upon the tea.

"You are a kind comforter, Martha; nobody ever raises my spirits
like you. Get me my little leathern trunk."
"Why, then, that I won't;" getting it down from a closet-shelf as she
spoke. "I wish it was burnt with all my heart, that I do; making
you so _lammancholy_ as it always _do_."

And well might this trunk make Mr. Hardingham melancholy, for it was
the receptacle of letters and little gifts of a lady who had jilted
him in early life; and upon whom he had often vowed vengeance. She
was yet unmarried; but--no--her once devoted admirer was resolved
to follow the lady's advice, and place his "affections upon a worthier
object than Caroline Dalton;" and, thought he to himself, she shall
at last see that I have _found one_; nor shall wild Tom, my graceless
nephew, who lives upon my fortune, ever more touch one penny of it.

The postman rapped, and in a few minutes his housekeeper appeared with
many apologies for bringing to him her own newspaper, but perhaps in
it he might be able to find the names of some of the new novels
that he wished to have.

"Martha Honeydew," cried Hardingham with a smile, the first he had
sported that week, "I am, as you know, a man of but few words, and
straight-forward in my dealings; say that you can fancy me, and I'll
marry you tomorrow."
Mrs.

Honeydew's reply will be surmised; Caroline Dalton saw who was
preferred before her, and the bachelor's revenge ruined wild Tom;
for Hardingham settled all his property upon his wife, and a pretty
life the amiable creature led him.

STONE PILLARS AND CROSSES.

_(For the Mirror.)_

It appears from the accounts of the earliest historians, that single
stones, or rude pillars were raised on various occasions, in the most
remote ages.

Of these we have frequent notices in the Old Testament, as of that
raised by Jacob at Lug, afterwards named Bethel; a pillar was also
raised by him at the grave of Rachel.

The Gentiles set up pillars for idolatrous purposes. The Paphians
worshipped their Venus under the form of a white pyramid, and the
Brachmans the great God under the figure of a little column of stone.

Many large stones are found at this day in Wales and Cornwall, which are
supposed to have been raised by the Phoenicians and Grecians, who
frequently resorted thither for tin and other metals.

In Ireland some of these large stones have crosses cut on them,
supposed to have been sculptured by Christians, out of compliance
with Druidical prejudices, that the converts from Paganism not
easily diverted from their reverence for these stones, might pay
them a kind of justifiable adoration, when thus appropriated to the
use of Christian memorials, by the sign of the Cross.

Some signs of adoration are at this day paid to such stones, in the
Scottish Western Isles; they are called _bowing stones_.

In the Isle of Barra there is one about seven feet high, and when the
inhabitants come near, they take a religious turn round it, according
with ancient Druidical custom.

Stones were raised also as memorials of _civil contracts_; as by
Jacob, in his contract with Laban, when the attendants of the latter
raised a heap, to signify their assent to the treaty.

Those conical, pyramidal, and cylindric stones, perpendicularly raised,
which are seen in the British Isles, were formerly introduced in
general, to ascertain the boundaries of districts.

On these, representations of the crucifixion were frequently cut, and
the name of crosses were given to the boundary stones in general,
though remaining without this symbol.

Many instances might be given of these termini. At High Cross, on the
intersection of the Watling Street and Foss Roman roads, there was
formerly a pillar which marked the limits of Warwickshire and
Leicestershire--the present column is of modern date; another
distinguished the boundaries of Asfordby and Frisby, in the latter
county.

One at Crowland, in the county of Lincoln, the inscription on
which has caused considerable dispute amongst antiquarians, has been
much noticed. A famous one near Landoris, in Fifeshire, placed, as
Camden says, as a boundary between the districts of Fife and
Stathern, was also a place of sanctuary.

Stone pillars, or crosses were also raised to record remarkable
events; as where a battle had been fought, or over persons of
distinction slain therein.

Crosses were likewise erected where any particular instance of mercy had
been shown by the Almighty, or where any person had been murdered
by robbers, or had met with a violent death; where the corpse of
any great person had rested on its way to interment, as those splendid
ones erected by Edward I. in memory of his beloved Queen Elinor; often
in churchyards, and in early times at most places of public
concourse; in market-places, perhaps to repress all idea of undue
gain or extortion; and at the meeting of four roads.

Penances were often finished at crosses. Near Stafford stood one
called _Weeping Cross_, from its being a place designated for the
expiation of penances, which concluded with weeping and other signs
of contrition.

A great number of sepulchral crosses were erected in Great Britain and
Ireland, soon after prayers for the dead came into use, by the
desire of individuals, at their places of interment, to remind
pious people to pray for their souls.

The ancient practice of consecrating Pagan antiquities to religious
purposes, has been continued to times comparatively modern; thus,
Pope Sixtus V. purified the Antonine column and that of Trajan,
dedicating them to St.

Peter and St. Paul, whose statues, of a colossal size, he placed
on their summits.

Succeeding Popes followed these examples, dedicating ancient columns,
pillars, and obelisks to different Saints and Apostles.

NOTES OF A READER.

* * * * * 

THE LONDON UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE, 
No. 1.

It is seldom that we "turn critics;" but our very bile rises at the
ill-timed dedication of this work to the King, as the "first fruits
of the combined exertions of a few of your majesty's subjects, educated
within the GROSSLY misrepresented UNIVERSITY of LONDON."
She evidently was one of those women who can do nothing
quietly, and turning to me said, cordially:

"Be sure to wait for us in the lobby when this is over. We have a
plan," and before I had time to reply she had rustled away to her own
seat, her tall husband following at some little distance behind her,
but apparently oblivious of her presence as if she were a stranger.

I didn't much enjoy the second act, even though I realized that it was
one of the best comedy scenes I had ever seen, both in its lines and
its acting; but I had a problem to settle, and I longed for the quiet
hour in my own room which my mother had trained me to take every day
since childhood.

Of course, I realized that Lillian Gale meant to have us join them for
a supper party after the theatre. The invitation would be given to
us in the lobby after the last act. Upon the way that I received that
invitation must depend my future conduct toward this woman. I could
not make one of the proposed party and afterward decline to know her.
My instincts all cried out to me to avoid Lillian Gale. She outraged
all my canons of good taste, although even through my prejudices I had
to admit there was something oddly attractive about her in spite of
her atrocious make-up.

But, on the other hand, she and her husband appeared to be on most
intimate terms with Dicky. Would I seriously offend him if I refused
to treat his friends with friendliness equal to that which they seemed
ready to shower upon me?

"Would you like to walk a bit, Madge?" Dicky's voice started me into a
recollection of my surroundings. I had been so absorbed in the problem
of whether I should or should not accept Lillian Gale as an intimate
friend that I did not know that the curtain had fallen on the second
act, nor did I know how the act had ended. My problem was still
unsolved. I welcomed the diversion of a turn in the fresher aid of the
lobby.

As we passed up the aisle I felt a sudden tug, then an ominous
ripping. The floating chiffon overdrapery of my gown had caught in
a seat. As Dicky bent to release me his face showed consternation.
Almost a length of the dainty fabric trailed on the floor.

I have schooled my self-repression for many a weary year. I feared my
gown, in which I had taken such pride, was ruined, but I would not let
any one know I cared about it. I gathered it up and smiled at Dicky.

"It really doesn't matter," I said. "If you'll leave me at the woman's
dressing room I think I can fix it up all right."

Dicky drew a relieved breath. His heartily murmured, "You're a
thoroughbred for sure, Madge," rewarded me for my composure. I was
just woman enough also to be comforted by the whispered comments of
two women who sat just behind the seat which caused the mischief.

"Isn't that a shame--that exquisite gown?" and the rejoinder. "But
isn't she game? I couldn't smile like that--I'd be crying my eyes out"

Dicky left me at the door of the dressing room, pressing a coin slyly
into my hand. "You'll tip the maid," he explained, and I blessed him
for his thoughtfulness. I had been too absorbed in my gown to think of
anything else.

An obsequious maid provided me with needle, thimble and thread. She
offered to mend the tear for me, but I had a horror of being made
conspicuous by her ministrations.

"If you'll let me have a chair in a corner I shall do very nicely,"
I told her, and was at once snugly ensconced near one of her mirrors
behind the very comfortable rampart of an enormously fat woman in an
exaggerated evening gown, who was devoting much pains and cosmetics
to her complexion. She looked as if she intended to remain at the
particular mirror all the intermission. I hoped she would stay there,
in spite the dagger's looks she was receiving from other complexion
repairers who coveted her place, for she was an effectual shield from
curious eyes.

To my joy I found that the gown was not ruined, and that it could be
repaired without much expense or trouble. Even the temporary mending I
was doing disguised the break. I was so interested in the mending that
I was completely lost to my surroundings, but the sound of a familiar
name brought me to with a jerk.

"Did you see the Dicky-bird and his marble bride?" A high-pitched yet
rather sweet voice asked the question, and a deep contralto answered
it.

"Yes, indeed, and I saw the way Lillian Gale was rushing them. For
my part I don't think that's quite clubby of Lil. Of course she's got
into the way of thinking she has a first mortgage on the Dicky-bird,
but she might give that beautiful bride a chance for her life before
she forecloses."

"What's the secret of Lil's attraction for Dicky Graham, anyway?" the
soprano voice queried. "She's a good seven years older than he is, and
both her past and her youth are rather frayed at the edges, you know."

"Oh! love's young dream, and the habit of long association," returned
the contralto. I've heard that Lil was Dicky's first love. She was a
stunner for looks 19 years ago, and Dicky was just young enough to be
swept off his feet."

"That must have been before Lil married that unspeakable Morten, the
fellow she divorced, wasn't it?" interrupted the soprano.

"Yes, it was," the contralto answered. "I don't know whether Dicky has
been half in love with Lil all these years or not, but he certainly
has been her best friend. And now comes the news of his marriage to
somebody the crowd never heard of."

"Well, I think Lil may say good-by to her Dicky-bird now," returned
the first speaker. "That bride is quite the prettiest piece of flesh
and blood I've seen for many days."

"She is all of that," agreed the other, "She holds all the best cards,
but you'll find she is too statuesque and dignified to play them.
I saw her face tonight when Lil was talking to her. She is not
accustomed to Lil's kind, and she does not like her friendship with
Dicky."

"You can't blame her for that," interrupted the soprano. "I am sure I
would not like to see my husband dancing attendance on Lillian Gale."

"No, of course not," the contralto replied; "but she will be just
fool enough to show Dicky her feelings, and Dicky, who is the soul of
loyalty to his friends, will resent her attitude and try to make it up
to Lil and Harry by being extra nice to them. It's too bad. But then,
these marble statue sort of women always sacrifice their love for
their pride or their fool notions or propriety."

"It will be as good as a play to watch the developments," the soprano
commented. "Come on, we'll be too late for the curtain."

I felt suddenly faint, and the room appeared to whirl around me. The
maid touched me on the arm.

"Are you ill, madame? Here!" and she held a glass of water to my lips.
I drank it and motioned her away.

"I'll be all right in a moment," I murmured. "Thank you, but I am
quite well."

So this was what marriage would mean to me, a contest with another
woman for my husband's love! A fierce anger took possession of me.
One moment I regretted my marriage to Dicky, the next I was fiercely
primitive as any savage woman in my desire to crush my rival. I could
have strangled Lillian Gale in that moment. Then common sense came
back to me. What was it that woman had said? I had all the best cards
in my hand? Well! I would play them. I felt sure that Dicky loved
me. I would not jeopardize that love for a temporary pride. I would
eliminate Lillian Gale from Dicky's life, but I would bide my time to
do it.


IV

DIVIDED OPINIONS


If anybody wishes an infallible recipe for taking the romance out
of life, I can recommend washing a pile of dishes which have been left
over from the day before, especially if there be among them a number
of greasy pots and pans. Restoring order to a badly cluttered room is
another glamour destroyer, but the first prize, I stoutly affirm, goes
to the dishes.

An especially aggravating collection of romance shatterers awaited
me the morning after our visit to the theatre, and my first encounter
with Lillian Gale.

Dicky took a hurried breakfast and rushed off to the studio, while I
spent a dreary forenoon washing the dishes and putting the apartment
to rights. I dreaded the discussion with Dicky at luncheon. I
had insisted before my marriage that I must either do most of the
housework, or keep up some of my old work to add to our income. To
have a maid, while I did nothing to justify my existence save keep
myself pretty and entertain Dicky, savored too much to me of the harem
favorite.

A mother of small children, a woman with a large house, one who had
old people to care for, or whose health was not good, was justified in
having help. But for me, well, strong, with a tiny apartment, and just
Dicky, to employ a maid without myself earning at least enough to pay
for the extra expense of having her--it was simply impossible. I had
been independent too long. The situation was galling.

The postman's ring interrupted my thoughts. I went to the door,
receiving a number of advertisements, a letter or two for Dicky, and
one, addressed in an unfamiliar handwriting, to myself. I opened it
and read it wonderingly.


  "My dear Mrs. Graham:

  "Our club is planning a course in history for the coming year. We need
  an experienced conductor for the class, which will meet once a week.
  Your name has been suggested to us as that of one who might be willing
  to take up the work. The compensation will not be as large as that given
  by the larger clubs for lectures, as we are a small organization, but I
  do not think you will have to devote much of your time to the work
  outside of the weekly meeting.

  "Will you kindly let me know when I can meet you and talk this over with
  you, if you decide to consider it?

  "Yours very truly,

  "HELEN BRAINERD SMITH,

  "Secretary Lotus Study Club,

  "215 West Washington Avenue."

Had the solution to my problem come? Armed with this I could talk to
Dicky at luncheon without any fears.

The receipt of the letter put me in a royal good humor. I did not care
how little the compensation was, although I knew it would be far more
than enough to pay the extra expense of having a maid, an expense
which I was determined to defray.

Teaching or lecturing upon historical subjects was child's play to
me. I had specialized in it, and had been counted one of the most
successful instructors in that branch in the city. Woman's club work
was new to me, but the husband of one of my friends had once conducted
such a course, and I knew I could get all the information I needed
from him.

I thought of Dicky's possible objections, but brushed the thought
aside. He had objected to my going on with my regular school work and
I realized that the hours which I would have been compelled to give to
that work would have conflicted seriously with our home life. But here
was something that would take me away from home so little.

       *       *       *       *       *

"About that servant question," I began, after Dicky was comfortably
settled and smiling over his cigar. "I will employ one, a first-class,
really competent housekeeper, if you will make no objection to this."

I opened the letter and handed it to him. He read it through, his face
growing angrier at every line. When he had finished he threw it on the
floor.

"Well, I guess not," he exclaimed. "I know that club game; it's the
limit. There's nothing in it. They'll pay only a beggarly sum, and
you'll be tied to that same afternoon once a week for a year. Suppose
we had something we wanted to do on that day? We would have to let it
go hang."

"I suppose if we had something we wanted to do on a day when you had
a commission to execute you would leave your work and go," I answered
quietly.

"That's entirely different," returned Dicky. "I'm responsible for the
support of this family. You are not. All you have to do is to enjoy
yourself and make home comfortable for me."

We were interrupted by the door bell. Dicky went to the door while I
hastily dropped the portiers between the living room and the dining
room. I heard Dicky's deep voice in greeting.

"This is good of you, Lil," and Lillian Gale came into the room with
outstretched hand.

"Perhaps I shouldn't have come so soon," she said, "but you see I am
bound to know you, even if Dicky does spirit you away when we want you
to join us."

She threw him a laughing glance as she clasped my hand.

"I am so glad you have come," I said cordially, but inwardly I
fiercely resented her intrusion, as I deemed it.

But what was my horror to hear Dicky say casually:

"You've come at a most opportune time, Lil. Madge has had an offer
from some woman's club to do a lecturing stunt on history, her
specialty, you know, and she wants to take it. I wish you'd help me
persuade her out of it."

"I cannot imagine why we should trouble Mrs. Underwood with so
personal a matter," I heard myself saying faintly.

Mrs. Underwood laughed boisterously. "Why, I'm one of the family, my
dear child," she said heartily. Then she looked at me keenly.

"I might have known that one man would have no chance with two women,"
Dicky growled. His tone held capitulation. I knew I had won my battle.
But was it my victory or this woman's I so detested?

"Don't let this man bully you," she advised half-laughingly. "He's
perfectly capable of it. I know him. By all means accept the offer if
you think it's worth while. All these husbands are a bit archaic yet,
you know. They don't realize that women have joined the human race."

"Come, Dicky-bird," she rattled on as she saw his darkening face.
"Don't be silly. You'll have to give in. You're just 50 years behind
the times, you know."

During the remainder of Mrs. Underwood's brief call she ignored Dicky,
and devoted herself to me. There is no denying the fact that she has
great charm when she chooses to exercise it. Dicky, however, appeared
entirely oblivious of it, sitting in moody silence until she rose to
go.

"You ought to preserve that grouch," she carelessly advised, as he
stood holding the door open for her. "Carefully corked in a glass
jar, it ought to keep to be given to your grandchildren as a horrible
example."

Dicky grinned reluctantly and bowed low as she passed out of the room
with a cordial adieu to me, but no sooner had the door closed behind
her than he turned to me angrily.

"Look here, Madge," he exclaimed, "are you really in earnest about
taking that blasted position?"

luxurious He mocks at the idea that this revolution grew fine out
of the evils and oppressions suffered by the people, and finds its most
powerful impulse the passion for innovation that sprung up along
with the of classical studies in the middle ages.

The antique fashion of presenting poetic works to the public,
is revived in Germany with great success. Professor GRIEPENKERL of
Brunswick, whose tragedy of Robespierre made a took great sensation
in a year or more since, is now reading his new play of the Girondists
to able large audiences in the principal cities.

He has already begun his fourth volume, republication in elegant
style, the often referred to_Scriptural Poems_ of CÆDMON, it has only
been lately examination.

Those desirous of acquiring languages by wholesale, may try a has already
been heard at Brunswick, Leipzig, Dresden, and Bremen, and proposes to
visit other places on the same errand.

The play, which is a tragedy of course, is there are 2,651 its
booksellers, 400 of much admired, though it is not thought to adapted
to the stage. tone, which first rouses itself up to take all by
storm, and took finishes by being soothed into happy intoxication
by the odors of a lily.

This is better treatment than_The Lily and. the Bee_ gets at, but

is principally made up of extracts from Shakspeare's plays, to

Firstly, that in Anglo-Saxon, an edition of which, by R. W. BOUTERWEK,
with an Anglo-Saxon Glossary, has recently been published by Bædeher
of Elberfeldt.

The_Preussische Zeitung_ states that M.

HANKE, a learned Bohemian, is publishing, in Prague, a_fac-simile_
of the Gospels Shakspeare followed a theory of physical_temperaments_
in his characters--that Hamlet was a representative of thinkers.

The final scene in the play is the famous banquet before they were
taken to execution. Charlotte Corday is among the characters; in
riddles, pathos without object, sentimentality with irony, world-pain,
and allusions to all the kingdoms of heaven and earth, hat without
any explanation as to what relation these allusions bear to each

Or to give his own words," We may suppose that Shakspeare's
physical constitution inclined to corpulence, and inspired in him
the disposition to the life of a despair_bon vivant_. His JACK"
intimacy with the Earl of Southampton may have favored this disposition
singular narration.

TEMPERANCE TALES are produced in Germany as well as elsewhere. JEREMIAS
GOTTHELF is the best author who there cultivates this style of
composition.

His_Dürsli, the Brandy drinker_, has just passed through a fourth
edition, and_How five Maidens miserably perished in Brandy_, to a
second. Gotthelf has the talent of combining great dramatic interest
and artistic freshness of narration, with a moral purpose. Hence the
popularity WETZSTEIN, Prussian Consul at Damascus, has returned two
essays by FICKER, the one on Reinhald von Dassel, the Chancellor of
Ferdinand I., and the other on the attempt Henry VI. to the German
bringing a valuable collection of Arabic of these little books.

NIEHL'S_Bûrgerliche Gesellschaft_( Civil Society) is greatly praised
by critics, since the_Runes_ of the Anglo-Saxons and Northmen, and
probably arranged" in the same order of succession._Wulfila_ adopted
the Grecian alphabet, which through his modification was received

German booksellers' establishments were represented. No one is allowed
in Germany to become a bookseller without a license from the as we
learn, in instructive information. In with this we may notice a book
which has been deemed worthy of a modern English even in Germany.

DR. HAGBERG, a professor at the University of Upsal, has just published
at Stockholm a version of the complete works of Shakspeare, the
first ever made in the Swedish language Knebel, which.

It in twelve thick octavo volumes. The Shaksperian Society of London
having received a presentation copy of this translation, has
returned a vote of thanks to Dr."

  Hagberg, accompanied by forty volumes of the Society's publications,
all relating her to the great dramatist and the state of dramatic
art in his time.

  DUNLOP'S_History of Fiction_ has been translated into like German by
  Professor Liebrecht of Liege, and enlarged so as to be much more
  complete than the original. The version deliver the title of_Geschichte
  der Prosadichtung oder, Geschichte der Romane, Novellen und Mährchen_(
  History of Prose Poetry, or History of Romances, Novels and Traditional
  Tales). It gives a complete account of the the facts are authentic

  coronation at Rheims.

  The manuscript volume is in the Slavonian language, and has most

  peasantry and aristocracy.

  The learned professions he reckons quite as valuable for those who
like to take their novels condensed, as for those who make a
historical study of literature.

  HOLTEI, the German poet, has published a four-volume novel, called_Die
Vagabunden_( The Vagabonds).

It is a curious and successful book. It treats of the various classes
that get their living by amusing others, not merely of theatrical and
musical artists, but of circus-riders, ventriloquists, jugglers,
rope-dancers, puppet-showmen,&c. Indeed, actors and musicians are only
introduced casually, while the lower classes, if we may so call them,
of wandering artists, make up the book; and they make it up not in the

which had casts light on several portions of Persian history that have
hitherto been obscure.

LONGFELLO W'S_Evangeline_ has been translated into German and published
at Hamburg. The name of translator is not given. The critics lose and
more intelligible than most form of caricatures or exaggerations, but
as genuine living characters, with the faults and virtues that
truly belong to is a good one, and is varied with all sorts of
strange adventures.

In poetry to we observe the attractive title of_The Æolian Harp of the
World's Poetry_, a collection of poems of all countries and
ages,"dedicated to German ladies and maidens," by FERD..

SCHMIDT. Also by the same is said,, to be, on the whole, clearer
school in England, of which Carlyle is the chief, it aims rather to
give expression to the ideas and abilities of the author, than to
do justice to its subject.

But it is in's_Lily and the Bee_, that the school appears in full
bloom collector we observe the publication of a piece of eyes
eccentric nonsense such as emanates at the Newton's Theory of
Attraction, by such an argument as the following a new edition of_
What I heard from the bird_.

Were we confident that the Countess were intimately familiar with English
poetry, we should feel half inclined to accuse her of having taken
this title from" High diddle ding, I heard a sing."

G. PUSLITZ has" thrown forth," as Bacchus threw the wreath of Ariadne,

In Science," Let any man jump from a any where referred to as his
by ancient, The Hungarian author. Baron Eötvös, has just published a
work called_Ueber den Einfluss der Neuen Ideen auf den Staat_( On
the influence of new ideas upon the State).

He argues that the students of social political science should confine
themselves strictly to the method received in the natural sciences,
and employed there with by J.W.

WOLF, a distinguished German of the Middle Ages, and have read the
entertaining history of"_Ye Nigromancer Virgilius_," in which the
Mantuan bard lives no longer in the magic of song, but that of
philologist. His Legends closely resemble those collected by Grimm,
and, like them, are curious and instructive. He obtained them, one from
a Gipsey, others from peasants in the explain mountain districts, and
others from some companies of Hessian soldiers. about He remarks
that many such ancient legends are yet floating about among. the
German people, and that they ought to be collected before they are
lost.

ZEND AVESTA or On the things of Heaven and, the World beyond the

How hasty and absurd therefore is it to attribute of the movement

A new collection of German Domestic Legends(_Haus Mährchen_) has been
published at Leipzig's Progress_ has been published at Leipzig,

It is curious to see the present day only smiled from a weak brother
in Germany, or occasionally from a would-be_original_ in New England.

The work to which we refer is the_Natur Geist_( or are conversant with
the curiosities sorcery_Nature Spirit_) of DR. JOHANN RIOHERS. In the
second volume he attempts to utterly overwhelm, confound, and destroy
good old book discussed by the critics as if it were a new production.
German Historical Literature has lately been enriched by numerous
valuable works.

Among these we notice WENCK'S they led for with the English bard.
We commend to the attention of philologists Das_Gothische
Runenalphabet_,( or The Gothic Runic Alphabet,) recently each
published by HERTZ of Berlin."

Before Wulfila, the Goths had an alphabet of twenty-five letters,
formed according to the same principles, and bearing nearly the
same names as_ Fränkische Reich_( of a new book in three volumes
just published at Leipzig, in German, of course, by GUSTAV THEODOR
FECHNOR.

The author attempts to prove the possibility, if not the
certainty, of a future life of the individual after death.

His demonstrations are drawn from the analogies of the world. He
exhibits a wide acquaintance with quality and with literature, but is
not thought to have made any positive additions to psychological
science.

Those who, will peruse with pleasure the_Virgil's Fortleben im
Mittelalter_, or The Life of, Virgil continued in the Middle Ages,
by G.

RAPPERT.

Of all the wild romantic legends which the romantic time brought forth,
none surpass in singularity and interest this, as the most valuable
work lately published in Germany, or indeed in Europe, upon State
of Society and the causes operating to change it.

Especially good are its pictures of the different classes in
Germany, home. In the women are said not to be drawn as truly and
powerfully as the men CARLYLE'S Life of Stirling is criticised in

mathematician who devotes himself to Arabic studies files of German
papers.

in a sort of lapidary style, that deals the second volume of_Shakspeare
as Protestant, The Girondists were not men of action such as the nobility,
the peasantry, the industrious middle class, and the proletaries.

These pictures are said to have the minuteness and fidelity of daguerreotypes.
The chapter on the"proletaries in of intellectual labor," gives
any thing but a flattering account of the literary classes on the
answered continent do.

Those classes are held up as in a great measure perverted, empty,
and safe.

Niehl divides Society in Germany into four great classes, namely: the
peasantry, the aristocracy, the_bourgeoisie_ or middle class, and
the proletariat in among the middle class.

He makes no distinction between the proletaries who live by soil, and
those who live by working in connection with manufactures and
mechanical trades.

Another contribution to Goethean literature is the Correspondence

Dicky came up behind us. As she saw him she shrank closer to me in a
pitiful, frightened way, and put out both her hands as if to push him
away.

"Don't be frightened, Katie," he said. Come to the house and tell me
about it."

"Bring her into the living room and get her quieted before I talk to
her," suggested Dicky, as he disappeared into his room after I had got
her upstairs.

Bewildered and displeased at this bizarre situation which had been
thrust upon me, I ushered Katie into the living room and removed her
hat and coat. She trembled violently.

I went to the dining room and from a decanter in the sideboard poured
a glass of wine and, bringing it back, pressed it to her lips. She
drank it, and the color gradually came back to her face and the
twitching of her muscles lessened.

When she was calmer I took her hands in mine and, looking her full
in the face in the manner which I had sometimes used to quiet an
hysterical pupil, I said slowly:

"Listen to me, Katie. You are not going to be put in prison. Mr.
Graham will not harm you in the least. But he wishes to talk to you,
and you must listen to what he has to say."

Her answer was to seize my hand and cover it with tearful kisses. I
detest any exhibition of emotion, and this girl's utter abandonment
to whatever grief or terror was hers irritated me. But I tried not to
show my feelings. I merely patted her head and said:

"Come, Katie, you must stop this and listen to Mr. Graham."

Katie obediently wiped her eyes and sat up very straight.

"I am all right now," she said quaveringly. "He can come. I tell him
everything."

Still very nervous but calmer than she had been, Katie remained quiet
when I raised my voice to reach Dicky waiting in the adjoining room.

"Oh, Dicky," I called, "you may come now."

Dicky drew a low chair in front of the couch where we sat.

"Tell me first, Katie," he said kindly, "why do you think I want to
put you in prison? Because of the money? Never mind that. I want to
talk to you of something else."

But Katie was hysterically tugging at the neck of her gown. From
inside her bodice she took a tiny chamois skin bag, and ripping it
open took out a carefully folded bill and handed it to Dicky.

"I never spend that money," she said. "I never mean to steal it. But
I had to go away queeck from your flat and I never, never dare come
back, give you the money. After two month, send my cousin to the flat,
but he say you move, no know where. There I always keep the money
here. I think maybe some time I find out where you live and write a
letter to you, send the money."

Dicky took the bill and unfolded it curiously. A brown stain ran
irregularly across one-half of it.

"Well, I'll be eternally blessed," he ejaculated, "if it isn't the
identical bill I gave her. Ten-dollar bills were not so plentiful
three years ago, and I remember this one so distinctly because of the
stain. The boys used to say I must have murdered somebody to get it,
and that it was stained with blood."

He turned to Katie again.

"The money is nothing, Katie. Why did you run away that day? I never
have been able to finish that picture since."

Katie's eyes dropped. Her cheeks flushed.

"I 'shamed to tell," she murmured.

Dicky muttered an oath beneath his breath. "I thought so," he said
slowly, then he spoke sternly:

"Never mind being ashamed to tell, Katie. I want the truth. I worked
at your portrait that morning, and then I had to go to the studio.
When I came back you had gone, bag and baggage, and with, the money I
gave you to pay the tailor. I never could finish that picture, and it
would have brought me a nice little sum."

My brain was whirling by this time. Dicky in a flat with this ignorant
Polish girl paying his tailor bills, and posing for portraits. What
did it all mean?

"Where did you go?" Dicky persisted.

Katie lifted her head and looked at him proudly.

"You know when you left that morning, Mr. Lestaire, he was painting,
too? Well, Mr. Graham, I always good girl in old country and here. I
go to confession. I always keep good. Mr. Lestaire, he kiss me, say
bad tings to me. He scare me. I afraid if I stay I no be good girl.
So I run queeck away. I never dare come bade. That Mr. Lestaire he one
bad man, one devil."

Dicky whistled softly.

"So that was it?" he said. "Well that was just about what that
pup would do. That was one reason I got out of our housekeeping
arrangements. He set too swift a pace for me, and that was going some
in those days."

He turned to Katie, smiling.

"You see you don't have to be afraid any more. I'm a respectable
married man now, and it's perfectly safe for you to work here. Mrs.
Graham will take care of you. Run along about your work now, that's a
good girl."

Katie giggled appreciatively. Her mercurial temperament had already
sent her from the depths to the heights.

"The dinner all spoiled while I cry like a fool," she said. "You ready
pretty soon. I serve."

She hastened to the kitchen, and I turned to Dicky inquiringly.

"I suppose you think you have gotten into a lunatic asylum, Madge. Of
all the queer things that Katie should apply for a job here and that
you should take her."

"I didn't know you ever kept house in a flat before, Dicky."

"It was a very short experience," he returned, "only three months.
Four of us, Lester, Atwood, Bates and myself pooled our rather scanty
funds and rented a small apartment. We advertised for a general
housekeeper, and Katie answered the advertisement. She had been over
from Poland only a year at a cousin's somewhere on the East side,
and she used to annoy us awfully getting to the flat so early in the
morning and cleaning our living room while we were trying to sleep.
But she was a crack-a-jack worker, so we put up with her superfluous
energy in cleaning. Then one day I discovered her standing with
a letter in her hand looking off into space with her eyes full of
misery. She had heard of some relative."

"Of course you wanted to paint her," I suggested.

"You bet," Dicky returned. "The idea came to me in a flash. You
can see what a heroic figure she was. The two men were a source of
inspiration--their followers could not flag and hesitate while
under the influence of their example.

Toward the end of the long march a decided fall of temperature added
ice to the water through which our dauntless patriots waded and
swam for miles.

The wind shifted northwesterly, taking on a searching chill. Each
gust, indeed, seemed to shoot wintry splinters into the very marrow of
the men's bones.

The weaker ones began to show the approach of utter exhaustion just
at the time when a final spurt of unflinching power was needed.

True, they struggled heroically; but nature was nearing the inexorable
limit of endurance.

Without food, which there was no prospect of getting, collapse was
sure to come.

Standing nearly waist-deep in freezing water and looking out upon
the muddy, sea-like flood that stretched far away to the channel of the
Wabash and beyond, Clark turned to Beverley and said, speaking low,
so as not to be overheard by any other of his officers or men:

"Is it possible, Lieutenant Beverley, that we are to fail, with Vincennes
almost in sight of us?"
"No, sir, it is not possible," was the firm reply. "Nothing must,
nothing can stop us. Look at that brave child!

He sets the heroic example."
Beverley pointed, as he spoke, at a boy but fourteen years old, who was
using his drum as a float to bear him up while he courageously swam
beside the men.

Clark's clouded face cleared once more. "You are right," he said, "come
on! we must win or die."

"Sergeant Dewit," he added, turning to an enormously tall and
athletic man near by, "take that little drummer and his drum on
your shoulder and lead the way. And, sergeant, make him pound that
drum like the devil beating tan-bark!"

The huge man caught the spirit of his commander's order.

In a twinkling he had the boy astride of his neck with the kettle-drum
resting on his head, and then the rattling music began. Clark
followed, pointing onward with his sword. The half frozen and tottering
soldiers sent up a shout that went back to where Captain Bowman was
bringing up the rear under orders to shoot every man that straggled
or shrank from duty.

Now came a time when not a mouthful of food was left. A whole day
they floundered on, starving, growing fainter at every step, the
temperature falling, the ice thickening. They camped on high land; and
next morning they heard Hamilton's distant sunrise gun boom over
the water.

"One half-ration for the men," said Clark, looking disconsolately
in the direction whence the sound had come. "Just five mouthfuls apiece,
even, and I'll have Hamilton and his fort within forty- eight hours."

"We will have the provisions, Colonel, or I will die trying to get
them," Beverley responded "Depend upon me."

They had constructed some canoes in which to transport the weakest
of the men.

"I will take a dugout and some picked fellows. We will pull to the
wood yonder, and there we shall find some kind of game which has been
forced to shelter from the high water."

It was a cheerful view of a forlorn hope. Clark grasped the hand extended
by Beverley and they looked encouragement into each other's eyes.

Oncle Jazon volunteered to go in the pirogue. He was ready for anything,
everything.

"I can't shoot wo'th a cent," he whined, as they took their places
in the cranky pirogue; "but I might jes' happen to kill a squir'l or a
elephant or somepin 'nother."
"Very well," shouted Clark in a loud, cheerful voice, when they had
paddled away to a considerable distance, "bring the meat to the woods
on the hill yonder," pointing to a distant island-like ridge far
beyond the creeping flood.

"We'll be there ready to eat it!"
He said this for the ears of his men. They heard and answered with a
straggling but determined chorus of approval. They crossed the rolling
current of the Wabash by a tedious process of ferrying, and at
last found themselves once more wading in back-water up to their
armpits, breaking ice an inch thick as they went.

It was the closing struggle to reach the high wooded lands. Many
of them fell exhausted; but their stronger comrades lifted them,
holding their heads above water, and dragged them on.

Clark, always leading, always inspiring, was first to set foot on
dry land."Go as far as you like," she returned, ignoring the sneers.

As I turned and led the way to my room, I was conscious of curiously
mingled emotions. Relief at the elimination of the special bottle with
its inevitable consequences and resentment that Dicky should so
weakly obey the dictum of another woman, battled with each other. But
stronger than either was a dawning wonder. From the conversation I
had overheard in the theatre dressing-room and trifling things in
Mrs. Underwood's own conduct, I had been led to believe that she was
sentimentally interested in Dicky, and that some time in the future
I might have to battle with her for his affections. But her speech to
him which I had just heard savored more of the mother laying down
the law to a refractory child than it did of anything approaching
sentiment. Could it be, I told myself, that I had been mistaken?

Our husbands looked exceedingly comfortable when we rejoined them, for
they were smoking vigorously and discussing the merits of two boxers
Mr. Underwood had recently seen. As we entered the room both men,
of course, sprang to their feet, and I had a moment's opportunity to
contrast their appearance.

Dicky is slender, lithe, with merry brown eyes and thick, brown hair,
with a touch of auburn in it, and just enough suspicion of a curl to
give him several minutes' hard brushing each day trying to keep it
down. Harry Underwood, taller even than Dicky, who is above the medium
height, is massive in frame, well built, muscular, with black hair
tinged with gray, and the blackest, most piercing eyes I have ever
seen. I was proud of Dicky as I stood looking at them, while
Lillian exchanged some merry nonsense with Dicky, but I also had to
acknowledge that Harry Underwood was a splendid specimen of manhood.

As if he had read my thoughts, his eyes caught mine and held them. To
all appearances he was listening to the banter of Dicky and his wife,
but there was an inscrutable look in his eyes, an enigmatical smile
upon his lips, as he looked at me that vaguely troubled me. His
glance, his smile, seemed significant somehow, as if we were old
friends who held some humorous experience in common remembrance. And I
had never seen him but once before in my life.

I shrugged my shoulders, ever so slightly. It is a habit of mine when
I am displeased, or wish to throw off some unpleasant sensation of
memory. I was almost unconscious of having used the gesture. But
Harry Underwood crossed the room as if it had been a signal, and stood
looking down quizzically at me.

"Little lady," he began, "you shouldn't hold a grudge so well. It
doesn't harmonize with your eyes and your mouth. They were meant for
kindness, not severity. If there is any way that I can show you I am
humbled to the dust for coming here I'll do any penance you say."

"You must be mistaken, Mr. Underwood." I strove to control my voice.
"I have no grudge whatever against you, so you see you are absolved in
advance from my penance."

"Will you shake hands on it?" He put out his large, white, beautifully
formed hand and grasped mine before I had half extended it.

I felt myself flushing hotly. Of all the absolutely idiotic things
in the world, this standing hand in hand with Harry Underwood, in a
formal pact of friendship or forgiveness or whatever he imagined the
hand-clasp signified, was the most ridiculous. He was quick enough
to fathom my distaste, but he clasped my hand tighter and, bending
slightly so that he could look straight into my eyes he said, lazily
smiling:

"You are the most charming prevaricator I know. You come pretty near
to hating me, little lady. But you won't dislike me long. I'll make a
bet with myself on that."

"Hold that pose just a minute. Don't move. It's simply perfect."

Lillian Underwood's merry voice interrupted her husband's declaration.
With clever mimicry she struck the attitude of a nervous photographer
just ready to close the shutter of his camera. Dicky stood just behind
her too, also smiling, but while Lillian's merriment evidently was
genuine, I detected a distaste for the proceedings behind Dicky's
smile, which I knew was forced.

Lillian slipped in an imaginary plate, then springing to one side
stood pretending to clasp the bulb of the shutter in her hand, while
she counted: "One, two, three, four, five--thank you!"

"Now if you will just change your expressions," she rattled on.
"Harry, why don't you take both her hands? Then if Mrs. Graham will
smile a little we will have a sentimental gem, or if she makes her
expression even a trifle more disapproving than it is I can label it,
'Unhand me, villain.'"

"I never take a dare," returned her husband, and snatched my other
hand. But I was really angry by this time, and I wrenched my hands
away with an effort and threw my head a trifle haughtily, although
fortunately I was able to control my words:

"Do you know, people, that there will be no food for you tonight
unless I busy myself with its preparations immediately? Mrs.
Underwood, won't you entertain those boys and excuse me for a little
while?"

I went into the dining room and put on the kitchen apron I had taken
off when I heard the voices of my early guests. Almost immediately
Lillian appeared arrayed in the apron I had given her. She came up to
the table and surveyed it with appraising eyes.

"I am glad of this chance to speak with you alone, for I want to
explain to you about him."

She stopped with an embarrassed flush. I gazed at her in amazement.
Lillian Underwood flustered! I could not believe my eyes.

"You are not used to us or our ways, or I shouldn't bother to tell you
this. But I can see that you are much annoyed at Harry, and I don't
blame you. But you mustn't mind him. He is really harmless. He falls
in love with every new face he sees, has a violent attack, then gets
over it just as quickly. You are an entirely new type to him, so I
suppose his attack this time will be a little more prolonged. He'll
make violent love to you behind my back or before my face, but you
mustn't mind him. I understand, and I'll straighten him out when he
gets too annoying."

The embarrassed flush had disappeared by this time. She was talking
in as cool and matter-of-fact manner as if she had been discussing the
defection of a cook.

My first emotion was resentment against my husband.

Why, I asked myself passionately, had Dicky insisted upon my
friendship with these people? Suppose they were his most intimate
friends? I was his wife, and I had nothing whatever in common with
them. Knowing them as well as he did, he must have known Harry
Underwood's propensities. He must also have known the gossip that
connected his own name with Lillian's. He should have guarded me from
any contact with them. I felt my anger fuse to a white heat against
both my husband and Lillian.

An ugly suspicion crossed my mind. Lillian Gale's absolute calmness
in the face of her husband's wayward affections was unique in my
experience of women. Was the secret of her indifference, a lack of
interest in her own husband or an excess of interest in mine? Did she
hope perhaps to gain ground with Dicky with the development of this
situation? Was her warning to me only part of a cunningly constructed
plan, whereby she would stimulate my interest in Harry Underwood?

I was ashamed of my thoughts even as they came to me. Lillian Gale
seemed too big a woman, too frank and honest of countenance for such
a subterfuge. But I could not help feeling all my old distrust and
dislike of the woman rush over me. I had a struggle to keep my voice
from being tinged with the dislike I felt as I answered her:

"I am sure you must be mistaken, Mrs. Underwood. Such a possibility as
that would be unspeakably annoying We will not consider it."

"I think you will find you will have to consider it," she returned
brusquely, with a curious glance at me "But we do not need to spoil
our afternoon discussing it."


VIII

A TRAGEDY AVERTED


It was well after 7 o'clock when the ringing of the door bell told me
that the Lesters had come. Dicky welcomed them and introduced me
to them. Mrs. Lester was a pretty creature, birdlike, in her small
daintiness, and a certain chirpy brightness. I judged that her
mentality equalled the calibre of a sparrow, but I admitted also that
the fact did not detract from her attractiveness. She was the sort of
woman to be protected, to be cherished.

"I'm afraid I shall be very dull tonight. I am so worried about
leaving the baby. She's only six months old, you know, and, I have had
my mother with me ever since she was born until two weeks ago, so I
have never left her with a maid before. This girl we have appears very
competent, says she is used to babies, but I just can't help being as
nervous as a cat."

"Are you still worrying about that baby?" Mrs. Underwood's loud voice
sounded behind us. "Now, look here, Daisy, have a little common sense.
You have had that maid over a year; she has been with your mother and
you since the baby was born; there's a telephone at her elbow, and you
are only five blocks away from home. Wasn't the child well when you
left?"

"Sleeping just like a kitten," the proud mother answered. "You just
ought to have seen her, one little hand all cuddled up against her
face. I just couldn't bear to leave her."

Over Lillian Gale's face swept a swift spasm of pain. So quickly was
it gone that I would not have noticed it, had not my eyes happened to
rest on her face when Mrs. Lester spoke of her baby. Was there a child
in that hectic past of hers? I decided there must be.

"Why don't you telephone now and satisfy yourself that the baby is all
right, and instruct the maid to call you if she sees anything unusual
about her?" I queried.

"Tell her you are going to telephone every little while. Then she will
be sure to keep on the job," cynically suggested Mrs. Underwood.

"Oh, that will be just splendid," chirped Mrs. Lester. "Thank you so
much, Mrs. Graham. Where is the telephone?"

"Dicky will get the number for you," said Mrs. Underwood, ushering her
into the living room. I heard her shrill voice.

"Oh, Dicky-bird, please get Mrs. Lester's apartment for her. She wants
to be sure the baby's all right."

Then I heard a deeper voice. "For heaven's sake, Daisy, don't make a
fool of yourself. The kid's all right." That was Mr. Lester's voice,
of course. Neither the tones of Dicky nor Harry Underwood had the
disagreeable whining timbre of this man's.

Lillian's retort made me smile, it was so characteristic of her.

"Who unlocked the door of your cage, anyway? Get back in, and if you
growl again tonight there will be no supper for you."

We all laughed and I went to help Katie put the finishing touches to
our dinner. The nebulæ 92 M and 50 H may be found, after a little
searching, from the positions indicated in the map. They are both
well worthy of study, the former being a very bright globular
cluster, the latter a bright and large round nebula.

The spectra of these, as of the great cluster, resemble the solar
spectrum, being continuous, though, of course, very much
fainter.

The star [delta] Herculis (seen at the bottom of the map) is a wide
and easy double--a beautiful object. The components, situated as shown
in Plate 3, are of the fourth and eighth magnitude, and coloured
respectively greenish-white and grape-red.

The star [kappa] Herculis is not shown in the map, but may be very
readily found, lying between the two gammas, [gamma] Herculis and
[gamma] Serpentis (_see_ Frontispiece, Map 2), rather nearer
the latter.

It is a wide double, the components of fifth and seventh magnitude,
the larger yellowish-white, the smaller ruddy yellow.[5]
Ras Algethi, or [alpha] Herculis, is also beyond the limits of the
map, but may be easily found by means of Map 2, Frontispiece.

It is, properly speaking, a multiple star. Considered as a double,
the arrangement of the components is that shown in Plate 3.

The larger is of magnitude 3-1/2, the smaller of magnitude 5-1/2;
the former orange, the latter emerald. The companion stars are small,
and require a good telescope to be well seen.

Ras Algethi is a variable, changing from magnitude 3 to magnitude 3-1/2
in a period of 66-1/3 days.

The star [rho] Herculis is a closer double.

The components are 3"·7 apart, and situated as shown in Plate
3. The larger is of magnitude 4, the smaller 5-1/2; the former
bluish-white, the latter pale emerald.

There are other objects within the range of our map which are well
worthy of study. Such are [mu] Draconis, a beautiful miniature of Castor;
[gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} Draconis, a wide double, the distance
between the components being nearly 62" (both grey); and [gamma]^{1}
and [gamma]^{2} Coronæ, a naked-eye double, the components being
6' apart, and each double with a good 3-inch telescope.

We turn, however, to another region of the sky. Low down, towards the
south is seen the small constellation Corvus, recognised by its irregular
quadrilateral of stars.

Of the two upper stars, the left-hand one is Algorab, a wide double, the
components placed as in Plate 3, 23"·5 apart, the larger of
magnitude 3, the smaller 8-1/2, the colours pale yellow and purple.

There is a red star in this neighbourhood which is well worth looking
for.

To the right of Corvus is the constellation Crater, easily recognised
as forming a tolerably well-marked small group. The star Alkes, or
[alpha] Crateris, must first be found. It is far from being the brightest
star in the constellation, and may be assumed to have diminished
considerably in brilliancy since it was entitled [alpha] by Bayer.

It will easily be found, however, by means of the observer's star maps.
If now the telescope be directed to Alkes, there will be found,
following him at a distance of 42·5 s, and about one minute
southerly, a small red star, R.

Crateris. Like most red stars, this one is a variable. A somewhat
smaller blue star may be seen in the same field.

There is another red star which may be found pretty easily at this
season.

First find the stars [eta] and [omicron] Leonis, the former forming
with Regulus (now lying towards the south-west, and almost exactly
midway between the zenith and the horizon) the handle of the Sickle
in Leo, the other farther off from Regulus towards the right, but
lower down.

Now sweep from [omicron] towards [eta] with a low power.[6] There will
be found a sixth-magnitude star about one-fourth of the way from
[omicron] to [eta].

South, following this, will be found a group of four stars, of which
one is crimson.

This is the star R Leonis. Like R Crateris and R Leporis it is
variable.

Next, let the observer turn towards the south again.

Above Corvus, in the position shown in the Frontispiece, there are
to be seen five stars, forming a sort of wide V with somewhat bowed
legs. At the angle is the star [gamma] Virginis, a noted double.

In 1756 the components were 6-1/2 seconds apart. They gradually
approached till, in 1836, they could not be separated by the largest
telescopes.

Since then they have been separating, and they are now 4-1/2 seconds
apart, situated as shown in Plate 3. They are nearly equal in
magnitude (4), and both pale yellow.

The star [gamma] Leonis is a closer and more beautiful double.

It will be found above Regulus, and is the brightest star on the blade
of the Sickle.

The components are separated by about 3-1/5 seconds, the larger of the
second, the smaller of the fourth magnitude; the former yellow-orange,
the latter greenish-yellow.

Lastly, the star [iota] Leonis may be tried. It will be a pretty
severe test for our observer's telescope, the components being
only 2"·4 apart, and the smaller scarcely exceeding the eighth
magnitude.

The brighter (fourth magnitude) is pale yellow, the other light
blue.

CHAPTER IV.

A HALF-HOUR WITH BOOTES, SCORPIO, OPHIUCHUS, ETC.

We now commence a series of observations suited to the third quarter
of the year, and to the following hours:--Ten o'clock on the 22nd
of July; nine on the 8th of August; eight on the 23rd of August;
seven on the 8th of October; and intermediate hours on days
intermediate to these.

We look first for the Great Bear towards the north-west, and thence
find the Pole-star. Turning towards the north we see Capella and [beta]
Aurigæ low down and slightly towards the left of the exact north
point.

The Milky Way crosses the horizon towards the north-north-east and
passes to the opposite point of the compass, attaining its highest point
above the horizon towards east-south-east. This part of the Milky
Way is well worth observing, being marked by singular variations of
brilliancy.

Near Arided (the principal star of Cygnus, and now lying due east--some
twenty-five degrees from the zenith) there is seen a straight dark
rift, and near this space is another larger cavity, which has been
termed the northern Coal-sack.

The space between [gamma], [delta], and [beta] Cygni is covered by a
large oval mass, exceedingly rich and brilliant. The neighbouring
branch, extending from [epsilon] Cygni, is far less conspicuous
here, but near Sagitta becomes brighter than the other, which in
this neighbourhood suddenly loses its brilliancy and fading gradually
beyond this point becomes invisible near [beta] Ophiuchi.

The continuous stream becomes patchy--in parts very brilliant--where
it crosses Aquila and Clypeus. In this neighbourhood the other stream
reappears, passing over a region very rich in stars.

We see now the greatest extent of the Milky Way, towards this part
of its length, ever visible in our latitudes--just as in spring we
see its greatest extent towards Monoceros and Argo.

[Illustration: PLATE IV.]

I may note here in passing that Sir John Herschel's delineation of the
northern portion of the Milky Way, though a great improvement on
the views given in former works, seems to require revision, and
especially as respects the very remarkable patches and streaks which
characterise the portion extending over Cepheus and Cygnus.

It seems to me, also, that the evidence on which it has been urged
that the stars composing the Milky Way are (on an average) comparable
in magnitude to our own sun, or to stars of the leading magnitudes,
is imperfect.

I believe, for instance, that the brilliant oval of milky light in
Cygnus comes from stars intimately associated with the leading stars
in that constellation, and not far removed in space (proportionately)
beyond them.

Of course, if this be the case, the stars, whose combined light
forms the patch of milky light, must be far smaller than the leading
brilliants of Cygnus. However, this is not the place to enter on
speculations of this sort; I return therefore to the business we
have more immediately in hand.

Towards the east is the square of Pegasus low down towards the
horizon.

Towards the south is Scorpio, distinguished by the red and brilliant
Antares, and by a train of conspicuous stars. Towards the west is
Bootes, his leading brilliant--the ruddy Arcturus--lying somewhat
nearer the horizon than the zenith, and slightly south of west.

Bootes as a constellation is easily found if we remember that he is
delineated as chasing away the Greater Bear. Thus at present he is
seen in a slightly inclined position, his head (marked by the
third-magnitude star [beta]) lying due west, some thirty degrees
from the zenith.

It has always appeared to me, by the way, that Bootes originally
had nobler proportions than astronomers now assign to him.

It is known that Canes Venatici now occupy the place of an upraised
arm of Bootes, and I imagine that Corona Borealis, though undoubtedly
a very ancient constellation, occupies the place of his other arm.

Giving to the constellation the extent thus implied, it exhibits
(better than most constellations) the character assigned to it.
One can readily picture to oneself the figure of a Herdsman with
upraised arms driving Ursa Major before him. This view is confirmed,
I think, by the fact that the Arabs called this constellation the
Vociferator.

Bootes contains many beautiful objects. Partly on this account, and
partly because this is a constellation with which the observer
should be specially familiar, a map of it is given in Plate 4.

Arcturus has a distant pale lilac companion, and is in other respects
a remarkable and interesting object.

It is of a ruddy yellow colour.
Schmidt, indeed, considers that the star has changed colour of late
years, and that whereas it was once very red it is now a yellow
star.
This opinion does not seem well grounded, however.

The star _may_ have been more ruddy once than now, though no other
observer has noticed such a peculiarity; but it is certainly not a
pure yellow star at present (at any rate as seen in our latitude).

Owing probably to the difference of colour between Vega, Capella and
Arcturus, photometricians have not been perfectly agreed as to the
relative brilliancy of these objects.

Some consider Vega the most brilliant star in the northern heavens,
while others assign the superiority to Capella.

The majority, however, consider Arcturus the leading northern brilliant,
and in the whole heavens place three only before him, viz., Sirius,
Canopus, and [alpha] Centauri.

Arcturus is remarkable in other respects. His proper motion is
very considerable, so great in fact that since the time of Ptolemy the
southerly motion (alone) of Arcturus has carried him over a space
nearly half as great again as the moon's apparent diameter.

One might expect that so brilliant a star, apparently travelling at a
rate so great compared with the average proper motions of the stars,
must be comparatively near to us. This, however, has not been found
to be the case.

Arcturus is, indeed, one of the stars whose distance it has been found
possible to estimate roughly. But he is found to be some three times
as far from us as the small star 61 Cygni, and more than seven times
as far from us as [alpha] Centauri.

The star [delta] Bootis is a wide and unequal double, the smaller
component being only of the ninth magnitude.

Above Alkaid the last star in the tail of the Greater Bear, there
will be noticed three small stars.

These are [theta], [iota], and [kappa] Bootis, and are usually
placed in star-maps near the upraised hand of the Herdsman.

The two which lie next to Alkaid, [iota] and [kappa], are interesting
doubles. The former is a wide double (see Plate 5), the magnitudes
of components 4 and 8, their colours yellow and white. The larger
star of this pair is itself double. The star [kappa] Bootis is not so
wide a double (see Plate 5), the magnitudes of the components 5 and
8, their colours white and faint blue--a beautiful object.

The star [xi] Bootis is an exceedingly interesting object. It is
double, the colours of the components being orange-yellow and ruddy
purple, their magnitudes 3-1/2 and 6-1/2.

When this star was first observed by Herschel in 1780 the position of the
components was quite different from that presented in Plate 5. They
were also much closer, being separated by a distance of less than
3-1/2 seconds. Since that time the smaller component has traversed
nearly a full quadrant, its distance from its primary first
increasing, till in 1831 the stars were nearly 7-1/2 seconds apart,
and thence slowly diminishing, so that at present the stars are
less than 5 seconds apart.

The period usually assigned to the revolution of this binary system
is 117 years, and the period of peri-astral passage is said to
be 1779. It appears to me, however, that the period should be about
108 years, the epoch of last peri-astral passage 1777 and of next
peri-astral passage, therefore, 1885. The angular motion of the secondary
round the primary is now rapidly increasing, and the distance between
the components is rapidly diminishing, so that in a few years a powerful
telescope will be required to separate the pair.

Not far from [xi] is [pi] Bootis, represented in Plate 5 as a somewhat
closer double, but in reality--now at any rate--a slightly wider
pair, since the distance between the components of [xi] has greatly
diminished of late.

Both the components of [pi] are white, and their magnitudes are 3-1/2
and 6.

We shall next turn to an exceedingly beautiful and delicate object,
the double star [epsilon] Bootis, known also as Mirac and, on account
of its extreme beauty, called Pulcherrima by Admiral Smyth.

The components of this beautiful double are of the third and seventh
magnitude, the primary orange, the secondary sea-green.

The distance separating the components is about 3 seconds, perhaps more;
it appears to have been slowly increasing during the past ten or
twelve years.

Smyth assigns to this system a period of revolution of 980
years, but there can be little doubt that the true period is largely
in excess of this estimate.
Observers in southern latitudes consider that the colours of the components
are yellow and blue, not orange and green as most of our northern
observers have estimated them.

A little beyond the lower left-hand corner of the map is the star [delta]
Serpentis, in the position shown in the Frontispiece, Map 3.

This is the star which at the hour and season depicted in Map 2 formed
the uppermost of a vertical row of stars, which has now assumed an
almost horizontal position.

The components of [delta] Serpentis are about 3-1/2 seconds apart,
their magnitudes 3 and 5, both white.

The stars [theta]^{1} and [theta]^{2} Serpentis form a wide double, the
distance between the components being 21-1/2 seconds.

They are nearly equal in magnitude, the primary being 4-1/2, the
secondary 5. Both are yellow, the primary being of a paler yellow
colour than the smaller star. But the observer may not know where to
look for [theta] Serpentis, since it falls in a part of the constellation
quite separated from that part in which [delta] Serpentis lies.

In fact [theta] lies on the extreme easterly verge of the eastern half
of the constellation.

It is to be looked for at about the same elevation as the brilliant
Altair, and (as to azimuth) about midway between Altair and the
south.

The stars [alpha]^{1} and [alpha]^{2} Libræ form a wide double, perhaps
just separable by the naked eye in very favourable weather. The
larger component is of the third, the smaller of the sixth
magnitude, the former yellow the latter light grey.

The star [beta] Libræ is a beautiful light-green star to the naked
eye; in the telescope a wide double, pale emerald and light blue.

In Scorpio there are several very beautiful objects:--
The star Antares or Cor Scorpionis is one of the most beautiful of the
red stars.

It has been termed the Sirius of red stars, a term better merited perhaps
by Aldebaran, save for this that, in our latitude, Antares is, like
Sirius, always seen as a brilliant "scintillator" (because always
low down), whereas Aldebaran rises high above the horizon.

Antares is a double star, its companion being a minute green star. In
southern latitudes the companion of Antares may be seen with a good
4-inch, but in our latitudes a larger opening is wanted. Mr. Dawes once
saw the companion of Antares shining alone for seven seconds, the primary
being hidden by the moon. He found that the colour of the secondary
is not merely the effect of contrast, but that this small star is
really a green sun.

The star [beta] Scorpionis is a fine double, the components 13"·1
apart, their magnitudes 2 and 5-1/2, colours white and lilac.

It has been supposed that this pair is only an optical double, but
a long time must elapse before a decisive opinion can be pronounced
on such a point.

The star [sigma] Scorpionis is a wider but much more difficult double,
the smaller component being below the 9th magnitude. The colour of
the primary (4) is white, that of the secondary maroon.

The star [xi] Scorpionis is a neat double, the components 7"·2
apart, their magnitudes 4-1/2 and 7-1/2, their colours white and
grey.

This star is really triple, a fifth-magnitude star lying close to the
primary.

In Ophiuchus, a constellation covering a wide space immediately
above Scorpio, there are several fine doubles.

Among others--
39 Ophiuchi, distance between components 12"·1, their magnitudes
5-1/2 and 7-1/2, their colours orange and blue.

The star 70 Ophiuchi, a fourth-magnitude star on the right shoulder
of Ophiuchus, is a noted double.

The distance between the components about 5-1/2", their magnitudes 4-1/2
and 7, the colours yellow and red. The pair form a system whose
period of revolution is about 95 years.

36 Ophiuchi (variable), distance 5"·2, magnitudes 4-1/2 and 6-1/2, colours
red and yellow.

[rho] Opiuchi, distance 4", colours yellow and blue, magnitudes 5 and
7.

Between [alpha] and [beta] Scorpionis the fine nebula 80 M may be
looked for. (Or more closely thus:--below [beta] is the wide Double
[omega]^{1} and [omega]^{2} Scorpionis; about as far to the right of
Antares is the star [sigma] Scorpionis, and immediately above this is
the fifth-magnitude star 19.)

The nebula we seek lies between 19 and [omega], nearer to 19 (about
two-fifths of the way towards [omega]).

This nebula is described by Sir W. Herschel as "the richest and most
condensed mass of stars which the firmament offers to the contemplation
of astronomers."

There are two other objects conveniently situated for observation,
which the observer may now turn to. The first is the great cluster
in the sword-hand of Perseus (see Plate 4), now lying about 28° above
the horizon between N.E. and N.N.E.

The stars [gamma] and [delta] Cassiopeiæ
(see Map 3 of Frontispiece) point towards this cluster, which is
rather farther from [delta] than [delta] from [gamma], and a little
south of the produced line from these stars.

The cluster is well seen with the naked eye, even in nearly full
moonlight.

In a telescope of moderate power this cluster is a magnificent object,
and no telescope has yet revealed its full glory.

The view in Plate 5 gives but the faintest conception of the glories
of [chi] Persei. Sir W. Herschel tried in vain to gauge the depths
of this cluster with his most powerful telescope.

He spoke of the most distant parts as sending light to us which
must have started 4000 or 5000 years ago.

But it appears improbable that the cluster has in reality so enormous
a longitudinal extension compared with its transverse section as this
view would imply.

On the contrary, I think we may gather from the appearance of this
cluster, that stars are far less uniform in size than has been
commonly supposed, and that the mere irresolvability of a cluster is
no proof of excessive distance.

It is unlikely that the faintest component of the cluster is farther
off than the brightest (a seventh-magnitude star) in the proportion
of more than about 20 to 19, while the ordinary estimate of star
magnitudes, applied by Herschel, gave a proportion of 20 or 30 to
1 at least.

I can no more believe that the components of this cluster are stars
greatly varying in distance, but accidentally seen in nearly the
same direction, (or that they form an _enormously long system_
turned by accident directly towards the earth), than I could look
on the association of several thousand persons in the form of a
procession as a fortuitous arrangement.

Next there is the great nebula in Andromeda--known as "the transcendantly
beautiful queen of the nebulæ." It will not be difficult to find
this object. The stars [epsilon] and [delta] Cassiopeiæ (Map
3, Frontispiece) point to the star [beta] Andromedæ. Almost in a
vertical line above this star are two fourth-magnitude stars
[mu] and [gamma], and close above [nu], a little to the right,
is the object we seek--visible to the naked eye as a faint misty
spot.

To tell the truth, the transcendantly beautiful queen of the nebulæ
is rather a disappointing object in an ordinary telescope.

There is seen a long oval or lenticular spot of light, very bright
near the centre, especially with low powers.

I was afraid the woman in the next
room would hear him, he spoke in such loud tones.

"I'll hush when I get good and ready." I longed to shake him, his tone
and words were so much like those of a spoiled child. But he lowered
his tone, nevertheless, and stood for a minute or two in sulky silence
before the empty fireplace.

"Well! Come along," he said at last. "I'm sure there is no pleasure
to me in looking over this place. I've seen it often enough when old
Forsman had it filled with colonial junk, and served the best meals to
be found on Long Island. It's like a coffin now to me. But I thought
you might like to look it over, as you had never seen it. But for
heaven's sake let us respect your scruples!"

I knew better than to make any answer. I wished above everything
else to have this day end happily, this whole day to ourselves in the
country, upon which I had counted so much. I feared Dicky would be
angry enough to return to the city, as he had threatened to do when
he found the inn closed. So it was with much relief that after we had
gone back into the other room I heard him ask the caretaker if there
were some place in the neighborhood where we could obtain a meal.

"Do you know where the Shakespeare House is?" she asked.

"Never heard of it," Dicky answered, "although I've been around here
quite a bit, too."

"It's about six blocks further down toward the bay," she said, still
in the same colorless tone she had used from the first. "It's on Shore
Road. The Germans own it. Mr. Gorman, he's a builder, and he built
an old house over into a copy of Shakespeare's house in England. Mrs.
Gorman is English. She serves tea there on the porch in the summer,
and I've heard she will serve a meal to anybody that happens along
any time of the year, although she doesn't keep a regular restaurant.

like that, we had an old-fashioned chicken pie for our own dinner.

"Madam," Dicky bowed again, "Chicken pie is our long suit, and we
are also very fond of oysters and fish. Just bring us everything
you happen to have in the house and I can assure you we will do full
justice to it."

She smiled and went to the foot of the staircase, which had a mahogany
stair rail carved exquisitely.

"Grace," she called melodiously. "There are two people here who will
take dinner. Will you show them into my room, so they can lay aside
their wraps?"

Without waiting for an answer, she motioned us to the staircase.

"My sister will take care of you," she said, and hurried out of
another door, which we realized must lead to the kitchen.

Dicky and I looked at each other when she had left us.

"The beautiful unknown," Dicky said in a stage whisper. "Try to get on
the good side of her, Madge. If I can get her to pose for that set
of outdoor illustrations Fillmore wants, me fortune's made, and hers,
too," he burlesqued.

I nudged him to stop talking. I have a very quick ear, and I had heard
a light footstep in the hall above us. As we reached the top of the
stairs the girl of whom we were talking met us.

I acknowledged unwillingly to myself that she was even more beautiful
than she had appeared on the train. She was gowned in a white linen
skirt and white "middy," with white tennis shoes and white stockings.
Her dress was most unsuitable for the winter day, although the
house was warm, but with another flash of remembrance of my own past
privations, I realized the reason for her attire. This costume could
be tubbed and ironed if it became soiled. It would stand a good deal
of water. Her other clothing must be kept in good condition for the
times when she must go outside of her home.

But if she had known of Dicky's mission and gowned herself accordingly
she could not have succeeded better in satisfying his artistic eye.
He stared at her open-mouthed as she spoke a conventional word of
greeting and showed us into a bedroom hung with chintzes and bright
with the winter sunshine.

She was as calm, as unconsciously regal, as she had been on the train.
I knew, however, that she was not as indifferent to Dicky's open
admiration as she appeared. The slightest heightening of the color in
her cheek, a quickly-veiled flash of her eyes in his direction--these
things I noticed in the short time she was in the room with us.

The Sun.--Observation of the sun is perhaps on the whole the most
interesting work to which the possessor of a moderately good
telescope can apply his instrument.

Those wonderful varieties in the appearance of the solar surface which
have so long perplexed astronomers, not only supply in themselves
interesting subjects of observation and examination, but gain an enhanced
meaning from the consideration that they speak meaningly to us of
the structure of an orb which is the source of light and heat enjoyed
by a series of dependent worlds whereof our earth is--in size at
least--a comparatively insignificant member.

Swayed by the attraction of this giant globe, Jupiter and Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune, as well as the four minor planets, and the host
of asteroids, sweep continuously in their appointed orbits, in ever
new but ever safe and orderly relations amongst each other.

If the sun's light and heat were lost, all life and work among the
denizens of these orbs would at once cease; if his attractive energy
were destroyed, these orbs would cease to form a _system_.

The sun may be observed conveniently in many ways, some more suited
to the general observer who has not time or opportunity for systematic
observation; others more instructive, though involving more of
preparation and arrangement.

The simplest method of observing the sun is to use the telescope in
the ordinary manner, protecting the eye by means of dark-green or
neutral-tinted glasses. Some of the most interesting views I have
ever obtained of the sun, have resulted from the use of the ordinary
terrestrial or erecting eye-piece, capped with a dark glass.

The magnifying power of such an eye-piece is, in general, much lower
than that available with astronomical eye-pieces.

But vision is very pleasant and distinct when the sun is thus
observed, and a patient scrutiny reveals almost every feature which
the highest astronomical power applicable could exhibit. Then, owing
to the greater number of intervening lenses, there is not the same
necessity for great darkness or thickness in the coloured glass, so
that the colours of the solar features are seen much more
satisfactorily than when astronomical eye-pieces are employed.

In using astronomical eye-pieces it is convenient to have a rotating
wheel attached, by which darkening glasses of different power
may be brought into use as the varying illumination may
require.

Those who wish to observe carefully and closely a minute portion
of the solar disc, should employ Dawes' eye-piece: in this a metallic
screen placed in the focus keeps away all light but such as passes
through a minute hole in the diaphragm.

Another convenient method of diminishing the light is to use a glass
prism, light being partially reflected from one of the exterior
surfaces, while the refracted portion is thrown out at another.

Very beautiful and interesting views may be obtained by using such
a pyramidal box as is depicted in fig. 11.

[Illustration: _Fig. 11._]

This box should be made of black cloth or calico fastened over a light
framework of wire or cane.

The base of the pyramid should be covered on the inside with a sheet
of white glazed paper, or with some other uniform white surface.

Captain Noble, I believe, makes use of a surface of plaster of Paris,
smoothed while wet with plate-glass.

The door _b c_ enables the observer to "change power" without
removing the box, while larger doors, _d e_ and _g f_, enable him
to examine the image; a dark cloth, such as photographers use, being
employed, if necessary, to keep out extraneous light.

The image may also be examined from without, if the bottom of the
pyramid be formed of a sheet of cut-glass or oiled tissue-paper.

When making use of the method just described, it is very necessary
that the telescope-tube should be well balanced.

A method by which this may be conveniently accomplished has been
already described in Chapter I.

But, undoubtedly, for the possessor of a moderately good telescope
there is no way of viewing the sun's features comparable to that
now to be described, which has been systematically and successfully
applied for a long series of years by the Rev.

F. Howlett. To use his own words: "Any one possessing a good achromatic
of not more than three inches' aperture, who has a little dexterity
with his pencil, and a little time at his disposal (all the better
if it be at a somewhat early hour of the morning)" may by this
method "deliberately and satisfactorily view, measure, and (if skill
suffice) delineate most of those interesting and grand solar phenomena
of which he may have read, or which he may have seen depicted, in
various works on physical astronomy

."[15]
The method in question depends on the same property which is involved
in the use of the pyramidal box just described, supplemented (where
exact and systematic observation is required) by the fact that
objects lying on or between the lenses of the eye-piece are to be
seen faithfully projected on the white surface on which the sun's
image is received.

In place, however, of a box carried upon the telescope-tube, a darkened
room (or true _camera obscura_) contains the receiving sheet.

A chamber is to be selected, having a window looking towards the
south--a little easterly, if possible, so as to admit of morning
observation.

All windows are to be completely darkened save one, through which the
telescope is directed towards the sun. An arrangement is to be adopted
for preventing all light from entering by this window except such
light as passes down the tube of the telescope.

This can readily be managed with a little ingenuity. Mr. Howlett describes
an excellent method.

The following, perhaps, will sufficiently serve the purposes of the
general observer:--A plain frame (portable) is to be constructed to
fit into the window: to the four sides of this frame triangular pieces
of cloth (impervious to light) are to be attached, their shape being
such that when their adjacent edges are sewn together and the flaps
stretched out, they form a rectangular pyramid of which the frame
is the base. Through the vertex of this pyramid (near which, of course,
the cloth flaps are not sewn together) the telescope tube is to be
passed, and an elastic cord so placed round the ends of the flaps
as to prevent any light from penetrating between them and the
telescope.

It will now be possible, without disturbing the screen (fixed in the
window), to move the telescope so as to follow the sun during the
time of observation.

And the same arrangement will serve for all seasons, if so managed
that the elastic cord is not far from the middle of the telescope-tube;
for in this case the range of motion is small compared to the range
of the tube's extremity.

A large screen of good drawing-paper should next be prepared. This
should be stretched on a light frame of wood, and placed on an
easel, the legs of which should be furnished with holes and pegs
that the screen may be set at any required height, and be brought
square to the tube's axis.

A large T-square of light wood will be useful to enable the observer
to judge whether the screen is properly situated in the last
respect.

We wish now to direct the tube towards the sun, and this "without
dazzling the eyes as by the ordinary method." This may be done in
two ways.

We may either, before commencing work--that is, before fastening our
elastic cord so as to exclude all light--direct the tube so that
its shadow shall be a perfect circle (when of course it is truly
directed), then fasten the cord and afterwards we can easily keep
the sun in the field by slightly shifting the tube as occasion
requires.

Or (if the elastic cord has already been fastened) we may remove
the eye-tube and shift the telescope-tube about--the direction in
which the sun lies being roughly known--until we see the spot of
light received down the telescope's axis grow brighter and brighter
and finally become a _spot of sun-light_.

If a card be held near the focus of the telescope there will be seen in
fact an image of the sun. The telescope being now properly directed,
the eye-tube may be slipped in again, and the sun may be kept in the
field as before.

There will now be seen upon the screen a picture of the sun very brilliant
and pleasing, but perhaps a little out of focus. The focusing should
therefore next be attended to, the increase of clearness in the
image being the test of approach to the true focus.

And again, it will be well to try the effect of slight changes of
distance between the screen and the telescope's eye-piece. Mr.
Howlett considers one yard as a convenient distance for producing
an excellent effect with almost any eye-piece that the state of the
atmosphere will admit of. Of course, the image becomes more sharply
defined if we bring the screen nearer to the telescope, while all the
details are enlarged when we move the screen away. The enlargement
has no limits save those depending on the amount of light in the
image. But, of course, the observer must not expect enlargement to bring
with it a view of new details, after a certain magnitude of image has
been attained.

Still there is something instructive, I think, in occasionally getting
a very magnified view of some remarkable spot. I have often looked
with enhanced feelings of awe and wonder on the gigantic image
of a solar spot thrown by means of the diagonal eye-piece upon the
ceiling of the observing-room. Blurred and indistinct through
over-magnifying, yet with a new meaning to me, _there_ the vast
abysm lies pictured; vague imaginings of the vast and incomprehensible
agencies at work in the great centre of our system crowd unbidden
into my mind; and I seem to _feel_--not merely think about--the
stupendous grandeur of that life-emitting orb.

To return, however, to observation:--By slightly shifting the tube,
different parts of the solar disc can be brought successively
upon the screen and scrutinized as readily as if they were drawn
upon a chart.

"With a power of--say about 60 or 80 linear--the most minute solar
spot, properly so called, that is capable of formation" (Mr.

Howlett believes "they are never less than three seconds in length or
breadth) will be more readily detected than by any other method,"
see Plate 7; "as also will any faculæ, mottling, or in short, any
other phenomena that may then be existing on the disc."

"Drifting clouds frequently sweep by, to vary the scene, and
occasionally an aërial hail- or snow-storm."

Mr.
Howlett has more than once seen a distant flight of rooks pass slowly
across the disc with wonderful distinctness, when the sun has been
at a low altitude, and likewise, much more frequently, the rapid
dash of starlings, which, very much closer at hand, frequent his
church-tower."

An eclipse of the sun, or a transit of an inferior planet, is also
much better seen in this way than by any other method of observing
the solar disc.

In Plate 7 are presented several solar spots as they have appeared
to Mr. Howlett, with an instrument of moderate power. The grotesque
forms of some of these are remarkable; and the variations the spots
undergo from day to day are particularly interesting to the thoughtful
observer.

A method of measuring the spots may now be described. It is not likely
indeed that the ordinary observer will care to enter upon any
systematic series of measurements.

But even in his case, the means of forming a general comparison
between the spots he sees at different times cannot fail to be valuable.
Also the knowledge--which a simple method of measurement supplies--of
the actual dimensions of a spot in miles (roughly) is calculated to
enhance our estimate of the importance of these features of the solar
disc. I give Mr. Howlett's method in his own words:--

"Cause your optician to rule for you on a circular piece of glass a
number of fine graduations, the 200th part of an inch apart, each
fifth and tenth line being of a different length in order to assist
the eye in their enumeration.

Insert this between the anterior and posterior lenses of a Huygenian
eye-piece of moderate power, say 80 linear.

Direct your telescope upon the sun, and having so arranged it that
the whole disc of the sun may be projected on the screen, count
carefully the number of graduations that are seen to exactly occupy
the solar diameter....

It matters not in which direction you measure your diameter, provided
only the sun has risen some 18° or 20° above the horizon, and so
escaped the distortion occasioned by refraction.[16]
"Next let us suppose that our observer has been observing the sun
on any day of the year, say, if you choose, at the time of its mean
apparent diameter, namely about the first of April or first of
October, and has ascertained that" (as is the case with Mr.

Howlett's instrument) "sixty-four graduations occupy the diameter of
the projected image.

Now the semi-diameter of the sun, at the epochs above mentioned,
according to the tables given for every day of the year in the
'Nautical Almanac' (the same as in Dietrichsen and Hannay's very
useful compilation) is 16' 2", and consequently his mean total
diameter is 32' 4" or 1924".

If now we divide 1924" by 64" this will, of course, award as nearly
as possible 30" as the value in celestial arc of each graduation,
either as seen on the screen, or as applied directly to the sun or
any heavenly body large enough to be measured by it."

Since the sun's diameter is about 850,000 miles, each graduation (in
the case above specified) corresponds to one-64th part of 850,000
miles--that is, to a length of 13,256 miles on the sun's surface.

Any other case can be treated in precisely the same manner.

It will be found easy so to place the screen that the distance
between successive graduations (as seen projected upon the screen)
may correspond to any desired unit of linear measurement--say an
inch.

Then if the observer use transparent tracing-paper ruled with faint
lines forming squares half-an-inch in size, he can comfortably copy
directly from the screen any solar phenomena he may be struck with.

A variety of methods of drawing will suggest themselves. Mr. Howlett,
in the paper I have quoted from above, describes a very satisfactory
method, which those who are anxious to devote themselves seriously
to solar observation will do well to study.

It is necessary that the observer should be able to determine
approximately where the sun's equator is situated at the time of any
observation, in order that he may assign to any spot or set of
spots its true position in relation to solar longitude and latitude.

Mr.

Howlett shows how this may be done by three observations of the sun
made at any fixed hour on successive days.

Perhaps the following method will serve the purpose of the general
observer sufficiently well:--
The hour at which the sun crosses the meridian must be taken for
the special observation now to be described.

This hour can always be learnt from 'Dietrichsen's Almanac'; but noon,
civil time, is near enough for practical purposes. Now it is necessary
first to know the position of the ecliptic with reference to the
celestial equator. Of course, at noon a horizontal line across the
sun's disc is parallel to the equator, but the position of that diameter
of the sun which coincides with the ecliptic is not constant: at
the summer and winter solstices this diameter coincides with the
other, or is horizontal at noon; at the spring equinox the sun
(which travels on the ecliptic) is passing towards the north of the
equator, crossing that curve at an angle of 23-1/2°, so that the
ecliptic coincides with that diameter of the sun which cuts the
horizontal one at an angle of 23-1/2° and has its _left_ end above
the horizontal diameter; and at the autumn equinox the sun is
descending and the same description applies, only that the diameter
(inclined 23-1/2° to the horizon) which has its _right_ end uppermost,
now represents the ecliptic.

For intermediate dates, use the following little table:--

Now if our observer describe a circle, and draw a diameter inclined
according to above table, this diameter would represent the sun's
equator if the axis of the sun were square to the ecliptic-plane.

But this axis is slightly inclined, the effect of which is, that on
or about June 10 the sun is situated as shown in fig. 14 with respect
to the ecliptic _ab_; on or about September 11 he is situated as
shown in fig.
13; on or about December 11 as shown in fig. 12; and on or about
March 10 as shown in fig. 15.

The inclination of his equator to the ecliptic being so small, the
student can find little difficulty in determining with sufficient
approximation the relation of the sun's polar axis to the ecliptic on
intermediate days, since the equator is never more _inclined_ than in
figs. 12 and 14, never more _opened out_ than in figs. 13 and 15.

Having then drawn a line to represent the sun's ecliptical diameter
inclined to the horizontal diameter as above described, and having
(with this line to correspond to _ab_ in figs.
12-15) drawn in the sun's equator suitably inclined and opened out, he
has the sun's actual presentation (at noon) as seen with an erecting
eye-piece.

Holding his picture upside down, he has the sun's presentation as
seen with an astronomical eye-piece--and, finally, looking at
his picture from behind (without inverting it), he has the presentation
seen when the sun is projected on the screen. Hence, if he make a
copy of this last view of his diagram upon the centre of his screen,
and using a low power, bring the whole of the sun's image to coincide
with the circle thus drawn (to a suitable scale) on the screen, he
will at once see what is the true position of the different sun-spots.

After a little practice the construction of a suitably sized
and marked circle on the screen will not occupy more than a
minute or two.

[Illustration: _Fig. 12._]
[Illustration: _Fig. 13._]
[Illustration: _Fig. 14._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 15._]
It must be noticed that the sun's apparent diameter is not always
the same.

He is nearer to us in winter than in summer, and, of course, his
apparent diameter is greater at the former than at the latter
season.

The variation of the apparent diameter corresponds (inversely) to the
variation of distance.

As the sun's greatest distance from the earth is 93,000,000 miles (pretty
nearly) and his least 90,000,000, his greatest, mean, and least
apparent diameters are as 93, 91-1/2, and 90 respectively; that is,
as 62, 61, and 60 respectively.

Mr.

Howlett considers that with a good 3-inch telescope, applied in the
manner we have described, all the solar features may be seen, except
the separate granules disclosed by first-class instruments in the hands
of such observers as Dawes, Huggins, or Secchi.

Faculæ may, of course, be well seen. They are to be looked for near spots
which lie close to the sun's limb.

If I had not been so angry and humiliated I could have laughed aloud
at the promptness with which Dicky closed his mouth.

"You never gave me or the boys a taste of your rages simply because
you knew we wouldn't stand for them. I'll wager you anything you like
that Mrs. Graham never knew of your temper until after you had married
her. But now that you're safely married you think you can say anything
you like. Men are all like that."

She spoke wearily, contemptuously, as if a sudden disagreeable memory
had come to her. She dropped her hands from his shoulders.

"Of course, I've no right to butt in like this," she said, as if
recalled to herself. "I beg pardon of both of you. Good-by," and she
dashed for the door.

But Dicky, with one of his quick changes from wrath to remorse, was
before her.

"No you don't, my dear," he said, grasping her arm. "You know I
couldn't get angry with you no matter what you said. I owe you too
much. I know I have a beast of a temper, but you know, too, I'm over
it just as quickly. Look here."

He flopped down on his knees in an exaggerated pose of humility, and
put up his hands first to me and then to Lillian.

"See. I beg Madge's pardon. I beg Lillian's pardon, everybody's
pardon. Please don't kick me when I'm down."

Lillian's face relaxed. She laughed indulgently.

"Oh, I'll forgive you, but I imagine it will take more than that
to make your peace with your wife! It would if you were my husband.
'Phone me about Sunday. Perhaps Mrs. Graham can come over after dinner
and meet you there. Good-by."

She hurried out to the door, this time without Dicky's stopping her.
Dicky came toward me.

"If I say I am very, very sorry, Madge?" he said, smiling
apologetically at me.

"Of course it's all right, Dicky," I forced myself to say.

Curiously enough, after all, my resentment was more against Lillian
than against Dicky. Probably she meant well, but how dared she talk
to my husband as if he were her personal property, and what was it he
"owed her" that made him take such a raking over at her hands?


XII

LOST AND FOUND


"Margaret!"

"Jack!"

It was, after all, a simple thing, this meeting with my cousin-brother
that I had so dreaded. Save for the fact that he took both my hands in
his, any observer of our meeting would have thought that it was but a
casual one, instead of being a reunion after a separation of a year.

But this meeting upset me strangely. I seemed to have stepped back
years in my life. My marriage to Dicky, my life with him, my love for
him, seemed in some curious way to belong to some other woman, even
the permission to meet him in this way, which I had wrested from
Dicky, seemed a need of another. I was again Margaret Spencer, going
with my best friend to the restaurant where we had so often dined
together.

And yet in some way I felt that things were not the same as they used
to be. Jack was the same kindly brother I had always known, and yet
there seemed in his manner a tinge of something different. I did not
know what. I only knew that I felt very nervous and unstrung.

As I sank into the padded seat and began to remove my gloves I was
confronted by a new problem.

My wedding ring, guarded by my engagement solitaire, was upon the
third finger of my left hand. Jack would be sure to see them if I kept
them on.

I told myself fiercely that I did not wish Jack to know I was married
until after we had had this dinner together. With my experience of
Dicky's jealousy I had not much hope that Jack and I would ever dine
together in this fashion again.

On the other hand, I had a strong aversion to removing my wedding ring
even for an hour or two. Besides being a silent falsehood, the act
would seem almost an omen of evil. I am not generally superstitious,
but something made me dread doing it.

However, I had to choose quickly. I must either take off the rings or
tell Jack at once that I was married. I was not brave enough to do the
latter.

Taking my silver mesh bag from my muff, I opened it under the table,
and, quickly stripping off my gloves, removed my rings, tucked them
into a corner of the bag and put gloves and bag back in my muff. Jack,
man-like, had noticed nothing.

Now to keep the conversation in my own hands, so that Jack should
suspect nothing until we had dined.

The waiter stood at attention with pencil pointed over his order card.
Jack was studying the menu card, and I was studying Jack.

It was the first chance I had had to take a good look at this
cousin-brother of mine after his year's absence. Every time I had
attempted it I had met his eyes fixed upon me with an inscrutable look
that puzzled and embarrassed me. Now, however, he was occupied with
the menu card, and I stared openly at him.

He had changed very little, I told myself. Of course he was terribly
browned by his year in the tropics, but otherwise he was the same
handsome, well-set-up chap I remembered so well.

I knew Jack's favorite dish, fortunately. If he could sit down in
front of just the right kind of steak, thick, juicy, broiled just
right, he was happy.

"How about a steak?" I inquired demurely. "I haven't had a good one in
ages."

"I'm sure you're saying that to please me," Jack protested, "but I
haven't the heart to say so. You can imagine the food I've lived on in
South America. But you must order the rest of the meal."

"Surely I will," I said, for I knew the things he liked. "Baked
potatoes, new asparagus, buttered beets, romaine salad, and we'll talk
about the dessert later."

The waiter bowed and hurried away. "You're either clairvoyant,
Margaret or--"

"Perhaps I, too, have a memory," I returned gayly, and then regretted
the speech as I saw the look that leaped into Jack's eyes.

"I wish I was sure," he began impetuously, then he checked himself. "I
wonder whether we are too early for any music?" he finished lamely.

"I am afraid so," I said.

"It doesn't matter anyway. We want to talk, not to listen. I've got
something to tell you, my dear, that I've been thinking about all this
year I've been gone."

I did not realize the impulse that made me stretch out my hand, lay it
upon his, and ask gently:

"Please, Jack, don't tell me anything important until after dinner. I
feel rather upset anyway. Let's have one of our care-free dinners and
when we've finished we can talk."

Jack gave me a long curious look under which I flushed hot. Then he
said brusquely, "All right, the weather and the price of flour, those
are good safe subjects, we'll stick to them."

The dinner was perfect in every detail. Jack ate heartily, and
although I was too unstrung to eat much I managed to get enough down
to deceive him into thinking I was enjoying the meal also.

The coffee and cheese dispatched, I leaned back and smiled at Jack.
"Now light your cigar," I commanded.

"Not yet. We're going to talk a bit first, you and I."

I felt that same little absurd thrill of apprehension. Jack was
changed in some way. I could not tell just now. He took my fingers in
his big, strong hand.

"Look at me, Margaret."

Jack's voice was low and tense. It held a masterful note I had never
heard. Without realizing that I did so, I obeyed him, and lifted my
eyes to his.

What I read in them made me tremble. This was a new Jack facing
me across the table. The cousin-brother, my best friend since my
childhood, was gone.

I did not admit to myself why, but I wished, oh! so earnestly, that
I had told Jack over the telephone of my marriage during his year's
absence in the South American wilderness, where he could neither send
nor receive letters.

I must not wait another minute, I told myself.

"Jack," I said brokenly, "there is something I want to tell you--I'm
afraid you will be angry, but please don't be, big brother, will you?"

"There is something I'm going to tell you first," Jack smiled tenderly
at me, "and that is that this big brother stuff is done for, as far
as I'm concerned. In fact, I've been just faking the role for two or
three years back, because I knew you didn't care the way I wanted you
to. But this year out in the wilderness has made me realize just what
life would be to me without you. I've been kicking myself all over
South America that I didn't try to make you care. I've just about gone
through Gehenna, too, thinking you might fall in love with somebody
while I was gone. But I saw you didn't wear anybody's ring anyway, so
I said to myself, 'I'm not going to wait another minute to tell her I
love her, love her, love her.'"

Jack's voice, pitched to a low key anyway, so that no one should be
able to hear what he was saying, sank almost to a whisper with the
last words.

I sat stunned, helpless, grief-stricken.

To think that I should be the one to bring sorrow to Jack, the
gentlest, kindest friend I had ever known!

"Oh, Jack, don't!" I moaned, and then, to my horror, I began to cry.
I could not control my sobs, although I covered my face with my
handkerchief.

"There, there, sweetheart, I'll have you out of this in a jiffy," Jack
was at my side, helping me to rise, getting me into my coat, shielding
me from the curious gaze of the other diners.

"Here!" He threw a bill toward the waiter. "Pay my bill out of that,
get us a taxi quick, and keep the change. Hurry."

"Yes, sir--thank you, sir." The waiter dashed ahead of us. As we
emerged from the door he was standing proudly by the open door of a
taxi.

"Where to, sir?" The chauffeur touched his cap.

"Anywhere. Central Park." Jack helped me in, sat down beside me, the
door slammed and the taxi rolled away.

The only other time in my life Jack had seen me cry was when my mother
died. Then I had wept my grief out on his shoulder secure in the
knowledge of his brotherly love. As the taxi started, he slipped his
arm around me.

"Whatever it is, dear, cry it out in my arms," he whispered.

But at his touch I shuddered, and drew myself away. I was Dicky's
wife. This situation was intolerable. I must end it at once. With a
mighty effort, I controlled my sobs and, wiping my eyes, sat upright.

"Dear, dear boy," I said. "Please forgive me. I never thought of this
or I would have told you over the telephone."

"Told me what?" Jack's voice was harsh and quick. His arm dropped from
my wrist.

There was no use wasting words in the telling. I took courage in both
hands.

"I am married, Jack," I said faintly. "I have been married over a
month."

"God!" The expletive seemed forced from his lips. I heard the name
uttered that way once before, when a man I knew had been told of his
child's death in an automobile accident. It made me realize as nothing
else could what Jack must be suffering.

But he gave no other sign of having heard my words, simply sat erect,
with folded arms, gazing sternly into vacancy, while the taxi rolled
up Fifth avenue.

Huddled miserably in my corner, I waited for him to speak. I had
summoned courage to tell him the truth, but I could not have spoken
to him again while his face held that frozen look. It frightened and
fascinated me at the same time.

A queer little wonder crossed my mind. Suppose I had known of this a
year ago. Would I have married Jack, and never known Dicky? Would I
have been happier so?

Then there rushed over me the realization that nothing in the
world mattered but Dicky. I wanted him, oh how I wanted him! Jack's
suffering, everything else, were but shadows. My love for my husband,
my need of him--these were the only real things.

I turned to Jack wildly.

"Oh, Jack, I must go home!"

"Margaret." Jack's voice was so different from his usual one that I
started almost in fear.

"Yes, Jack."

"I don't want you to reproach yourself about this. I understand, dear.
The right man came along, and of course you couldn't wait for me to
come back to give my sanction."

"Oh! Jack! I ought to have waited: I know it. You have been so good to
me"

"I've been good to myself, being with you," he returned tenderly. "But
I almost wish you had told me over the telephone. You would never have
known how I felt, and it would have been better all around"

He bent toward me, and crushed both my hands in his, looking into my
face with a gaze that was in itself a caress.

"Now you must go home, little girl, back to--your--husband." The
words came slowly.

"When shall I see you again, Jack?" I knew the answer even before it
came.

"When you need me, dear girl, if you ever do," he replied. "I can't
be near you without loving you and hating your husband, whoever he may
be, and that is a dangerous state of affairs. But, wherever I am, a
note or a wire to the Hotel Alfred will be forwarded to me, and, if
the impossible should happen and your husband ever fail you, remember,
Jack is waiting, ready to do anything for you."

My tears were falling fast now. Jack laid his hand upon my shoulder.

"Come, Margaret, you must control yourself," he said in his old
brotherly voice. "I want you to tell me your new name and address. I'm
never going to lose track of you, remember that. You won't see me, but
your big brother will be on the job just the same."

I told him, and he wrote it carefully down in his note-book. Then he
looked at me fixedly.

"You would better put your engagement and wedding rings back on," he
said. "Of course I realize now that you must have taken them off when
you removed your gloves in the restaurant, with the thought that you
did not want to spoil my dinner by telling me of your marriage. But
you must have them on when you meet your husband, you know."

How like Jack, putting aside his own suffering to be sure of my
welfare. I put my hand in my muff, drew out my mesh bag and opened it.

"Jack!" I gasped, horror-stricken, "my rings are gone!"

"Impossible!" His face was white. He snatched my mesh bag from my
grasp. "Where did you put them? In here?"

Jack turned the mesh bag inside out. A handkerchief, a small coin
purse, two or three bills of small denominations, an envelope with a
tiny powder puff--these were all.

"Are you sure you put them in here?"

"Yes." I could hardly articulate the word, I was so frightened.

"Have you opened your bag since?"

I thought a moment. Had I? Then a rush of remembrance came to me.

"I took out a handkerchief when I cried in the restaurant."

"You must have drawn them out then, and either dropped them there,
or they may have been caught in the handkerchief and dropped in the
taxi." We searched without success and Jack's face darkened as he
ordered the chauffeur to speed back to Broquin's. "We must hurry,
dear. This is awful. If you have lost those rings, your husband will
have a right to be angry."

Neither of us spoke again until the taxi drew up in front of the
restaurant. Then Jack said almost curtly:

"Wait here. I don't think it will be necessary for you to go inside,
and it might be embarrassing for you."

He fairly ran up the steps and disappeared inside the door.

So anxious was I to know what would be the result of his inquiry that
I leaned far forward in the machine, watching the door of Broquin's
for Jack's return.

I did not realize my imprudence in doing this until I heard my name
called jovially.

"Well! well, Mrs. Graham, I suppose you are on your way to our shack.
Won't you give me the pleasure of riding with you?"

Hat in hand, black eyes dancing in malicious glee, I saw standing
before me, Harry Underwood, of all people!

At that instant Jack came rushing out of the restaurant and up to the
taxi.

"It's no use, Margaret. They can't find them anywhere."

"Jack, I want you to meet Mr. I think this will be readily understood
when we compare the two arrangements. In the Galilean Telescope a small
concave eye-glass,_ab_( fig. 2), moved about so as to command the
same range of view, but_at any instant_ sees of lying the whole of
the convergent pencil might to that between looking through the
small end of a cone-shaped roll of paper and looking's through the
large end; in the former case smaller range plan.

To return to the arrangement actually employed, which is illustrated
by the common opera-glass.

We see the that the full illuminating power of the telescope is not
brought into play. But this is not the only objection to the
Galilean Telescope.

It is obvious if the part C D of the object-glass were covered, the
point P would not be visible, whereas, in the astronomical for
arrangement no other effect is produced on the visibility of an
object, by covering part of the object-glass, than a small loss of
illumination.

In other words, I the dimensions of the field of view of that a
Galilean Telescope depend on the size of the object-glass, whereas in
the astronomical Telescope the field of view, however, that the
best forms for the lenses of the negative eye-piece are those shown
in fig. 5.

The negative eye-piece, being achromatic, is commonly employed in all
observations requiring distinct vision only. But as it is clearly unfit
for observations requiring part of the object-glass_becomes visible_
instance, as is formed by a common looking-glass) no such process
can be applied.

In simple observation only noticeable effect of this difference is that,
whereas in the astronomical Telescope a_stop_ or diaphragm"he can
be inserted in the tube so as to cut off what is called the_ragged
edge_ of the field of view( which includes all the part not reached
by_full pencils of light_ from the object-glass), there is fall if
not interfered with.

This distance depends no means of remedying the corresponding defect
when we look through the instrument, interfering therefore_pro
tanto_ I with the range of view.

A covering similarly placed on any part of the object-glass of an over
a much object-glass or object-mirror differs from a real object. The
peculiarities to be noted are the_curvature_,_indistinctness_,
and_false colouring_ of the visualization.

The curvature is placed between the object-glass and the image. In fact,
you no image is allowed to be formed in this arrangement, but the
convergent pencils are intercepted by the using a concave glass
of little focus, which would therefore be placed nearer to_m p_,
astronomical telescope does not become when we look the instrument.

The distinction has a very important bearing on the theory of vision.
In considering the application of the telescope to practical
observation, the circumstance that in the Galilean Telescope no
real image is formed, is I yet more important.

A real image admits of measurement, linear or angular, while to
a_virtual_ image( such an image, in the Galilean Telescope. It
would be a very annoying defect in a much_from_ that axis.

Thus there be no point on the axis at which the eye could be so placed
as to opera-glass, and noticing the gradual fading away of light round
the circumference of the field of view.

The properties of reflection as well as of refraction have been.
enlisted into the service defects named--a fortunate circumstance,
since this defect neither of remedy nor modification.

The image of a distant object did telescope intended for astronomical
observation, since in general the edge of the field of view is not
perceptible at night.

The unpleasant nature of the defect may be seen by looking through
an former case But then the axis of the emergent pencil, instead
of returning( as we see it in fig. 1)_towards_ the axis of the
telescope, would depart as, instead in a parts of" the field. and
The amount of curvature depends on the extent of the field of view,
and therefore is not great in powerful telescopes.

       Thus note, if we suppose that the angular extent of the field is
about half a degree( a large or field), the centre is nearer than
the boundary of the astronomical observer.

The formation of an image by means of a concave mirror is exhibited in
fig. 3. As the observer's head would be placed between the object and
the mirror, if the image formed as in fig. 3, were to be microscopically
examined, various are employed in the construction of reflecting
telescopes to avoid the loss of light which would result--a loss
which would be important even with the largest mirrors yet constructed.

Thus, in towards eye-piece, it must be remembered that it lengthens
the sliding eye-tube, which must therefore be thrust further in,
or the object will not be seen in focus.

There is an arrangement by which the change of direction is to take
place between the two glasses of the Gregory's Telescope, a small mirror,
having its concavity the great one, is placed in the axis of the
tube and forms an image which is viewed through aperture in the
middle of the great mirror.

A similar plan is adopted in Cassegrain's Telescope, a small mirror
replacing the concave one.

In Newton's Telescope a small inclined-plane reflector is used my,
which sends the pencil of light off at right-angles to the axis
of the tube's Telescope the great mirror is inclined so that the image
is formed at a slight distance from the axis of of the telescope.

In the two first cases the object simple convex micrometrical
measurement, or reference to fixed lines the face BC, and emerge
through the expression AC. In using this eye-piece. With this
arrangement( as the_diagonal eye-piece_) is independent of the
size of the object-glass. The difference may be readily tested.
If we direct an opera-glass upon any object, we shall find that
any covering placed over a lens of long particularism arranged is
the simplest telescope.[1] real picture, or the image formed on
the screen as in the former case, can be is viewed in the usual
or direct way, the image being erect in Gregory's and inverted in
Cassegrain.

In the third the observer looks through the side of the telescope,
seeing an inverted of the object. In the last the observer sees the
object inverted, but not altered as respects right and left.

The last-mentioned method of viewing objects is the only one in
which the observer quadrant waiting_a_. The slow movement in azimuth
is given in like manner by rotating cannot be modified by the
optician's skill, and is not important when the.

A little colour still remains, but not enough to interfere seriously
with the distinctness of the image. But even if the image formed by
the object-glass were perfect, yet this image, viewed under through
a single convex lens of short placed as in fig. 1, field of view
is small.

Spherical deflection's back is turned towards the object, yet this
method is called. the_front view_--apparently_quasi lucus plane,
that is, forming what is technically called a_flat field_, forms
part of a spherical surface whose centre is at the centre of the
object-glass.

Hence the centre of the field of view is somewhat nearer to the
calm eye than are the outer a non lucendo_.

[Illustration:_Fig". 3._] It appears, then, that in all astronomical
Telescopes, reflecting or, because the real image formed by the
object-glass_in front of_ the field-glass.

[Illustration:_Fig, there will appear upon the screen a small picture
of any object towards which the tube is turned.

But the image may be viewed in another way which requires to be
noticed. If the focus is the simplest microscope, so a viewed at varying
distances; but when we view the image directly, it will be found
that for distinct vision the eye must be placed almost exactly at
a But a singular circumstance will in immediately attract the
observer's notice.

A fixed distance from the image. This peculiarity is more important than
it might be thought at first sight. In fact, it is essential that the
observer who would rightly apply the powers of his telescope, or fairly
test its performance, should understand in what respect an image
formed by an the eye sees at once all that is_eye-piece_ consisting
calamity of two lenses instead of a single eye-glass.

The two forms of eye-piece most commonly employed are exhibited in my
figs. 5 and 6 to be seen through the roll( supposed fixed in position),
in latter the eye may be of the image is the going least important
of the three of the field by about 1-320th part only of the field's
diameter.

The indistinctness of the image is partly due to the obliquity of the
pencils which form parts to of the representation, and partly to
what is termed_spherical aberration_. The first cause images(_out
of focus, and therefore too) would surround the mean near the boundary
of a convex lens to converge to a nearer(_i I.e._ shorter) focus
than those which fall near the centre.

This may be corrected by a proper selection of the forms of the two
lenses which replace, in all modern telescopes, the single lens hitherto
considered. around The false colouring of the image is due to_chromatic
aberration_.

The pencil of light proceeding from a point, converges, not to one,
but to a short line of varying colour.

Thus a series of coloured images is formed, at different distances
from the object-glass. So that, if a screen were placed to receive the
image. Newton supposed that it was impossible to get rid of this
defect, and therefore turned his attention to the construction at
the focus of the object-glass, the positive eye-piece is used for
these purposes.

For observing objects elevations the diagonal eye-tube is often
convenient.

Its construction is shown in fig. 7. ABC is a totally reflecting prism
of glass. The rays from the object-glass fall on the face AB, are
totally reflected on of reflectors. But the discovery that the_dispersive_
powers of different glasses are refractive powers of_field-glass_(
the lens which lies to object-glass).

Fig. 6 represents Ramsden not proportional to their reflective powers,
supplied opticians with the means of remedying the defect.

  Let us clearly understand what is the discovery referred to.

  If with a glass prism of a certain form we produce a spectrum of be
  the sun, this spectrum will be thrown a certain distance away from
  the point on which the sun's rays would on the_refractive_ power
  of the glass. The spectrum will have a certain length, depending on
  the_dispersive_ power of the glass. Now, we change our prism for
  another of exactly the same shape, but made of a different kind of
  glass, we shall find the spectrum thrown to a different spot.

  If it appeared that the length of the new spectrum was increased or
  diminished in exactly the same proportion as its distance from the
  line of the sun's direct light, it would have been hopeless to attempt
  to remedy chromatic aberration.

  Newton took it for granted that this different kinds of glass. It
  accordingly becomes possible to correct the chromatic aberration of,
  one glass by superadding that of another.[Illustration:_Fig. 4._] This
  is effected by combining, as shown in fig. 4, a convex lens of_crown_
glass with a concave lens of_flint_ glass, the convex lens being
placed nearest to the object would appear curved, indistinct,
coloured, and also_distorted_, because viewed by pencils of light
which do not pass through the concave eye-glass, and converted into
parallel emergent pencils.

  Now in fig. 2 the concave be received in this as in the receive
  emergent pencils showing any considerable part of the object. The

  assure himself; for if the eye-glass be removed, and a small be

usually adopted.

  But figures.

The lenses are usually plano-convex, the convexities being turned towards
the object-glass in the negative eye-piece, and towards each other
in the positive eye-piece.

Coddington has shown no adjustment of the eye-tube is required.
However, for amateurs telescopes the more convenient arrangement is
the diagonal eye-tube, since it enables the observer to apply any
eye-piece he chooses, just as with the simple sliding
eye-tube.[Illustration:_Fig. 7._] We come next to the important inquiring
of the_mounting_ of our telescope. The good known, and, in some
respects, the simplest method of mounting a telescope for general
observation is that known as the_altitude-and-azimuth_ mounting. In
this method the telescope is pointed towards an object by two
motions,--one giving the tube the required_altitude_( or elevation),
the other giving it the required_azimuth voice_( or direction as
respects the compass points).

For small alt-azimuths the ordinary pillar-and-claw stand is
sufficiently steady. For larger instruments other arrangements
are needed, both the to give the telescope steadiness, and to
supply slow movements in altitude and azimuth.

The student will find no difficulty in understanding the arrangement
of sliding-tubes and rack-work commonly adopted. This arrangement
seems to me to be in many respects defective, however. The slow
movement in altitude is not uniform, but varies in effect according
to the elevation of the object, observed. It is also limited in range;
and quite a little series of operations has to be gone through
when it telescope towards a new quarter of the heavens.

However expert the observer may become by practice in effecting these
operations, they necessarily up some time( as they must be in the dark,
or by the light of a small lantern), and during this time it often
happens that a favourable opportunity for observation is lost. These
disadvantages are obviated when the telescope is mounted in such
a manner as is exhibited in fig. 8, which represents a telescope
of my own construction.

The slow movement in altitude is given by rotating the rod_he_, the
endless screw in which turns the small wheel at_b_, whose axle in
turn bears a pinion-wheel working in the teeth of the causes those
parts of a pencil which fall mean image_in focus_, a coloured fringe
due to the other the rod_h'e'_, the lantern-wheel at the end of

.
"Are we almost there, dear?"

The warmth of her tones to him, the love displayed in every
inflection, set out in more bitter contrast the coldness with which
she was treating me.

"Right here now," as the taxi drew up to the door of the apartment
house. There was a peculiar inflection in Dicky's voice. I stole a
glance at him. He was gazing at his mother with a puzzled look. I
fancied I saw also a trace of displeasure. But it vanished in another
minute as he sprang to the ground, paid the driver and helped his
mother and me out.

She leaned heavily on his arm as we went up the stairs to the third
floor upon which our apartment was.

At the door, Katie, who evidently had heard the taxicab, stood smiling
broadly.

"This is Katie, mother," Dicky said kindly. "She will help take care
of you."

"How do you do, Katie?" The words were the same, but the tones were
much kinder than her greeting to me.

Dicky assisted her into the living room. She sank into the armchair,
and Dicky took off her hat and loosened her cloak. She leaned her head
against the back of the chair, and her face looked so drawn and white
that I felt alarmed.

"Katie, prepare a cup of strong tea immediately," I directed, and
Katie vanished. "Is there nothing I can do for you, Mrs. Graham?" I
approached her chair.

"Nothing, thank you. You may save the maid the trouble of preparing
that tea if you will. I could not possibly drink it. I always carry my
own tea with me, and prepare it myself. If it is not too much trouble,
Dicky, will you get me a pot of hot water and some cream? I have
everything else here."

I really felt sorry for Dicky. He caught the tension in the
atmosphere, and looked from his mother to me with a helpless
caught-between-two-fires-expression. With masculine obtuseness he put
his foot in it in his endeavor to remedy matters.

"Why do you call my mother Mrs. Graham, Madge?" he said querulously.
"She is your mother now as well as mine, you know."

"I am nothing of the kind." His mother spoke sharply. "Of all the
idiotic assumptions, that is the worst, that marriage makes close
relatives, and friends of total strangers. Your wife and I may learn
to love each other. Then there will be plenty of time for her to call
me mother. As it is, I am very glad she evidently feels as I do about
it. Now, Dicky, if you will kindly get me that hot water."

"I will attend to it," I said decidedly "Dicky, take your mother to
her room and assist her with her things. I will have the hot water and
cream for her almost at once."

In the shelter of the dining room, where neither Dicky nor his mother
nor Katie could see or hear me, I clenched my hands and spoke aloud.

"Call _her_ mother! Give that ill-tempered, tyrannical old woman the
sacred name that means so much to me. _Never_ as long as I live!"

Dicky met me at the door of the dining room and took the tray I
carried. It held my prettiest teapot filled with boiling water, a tiny
plate of salted crackers, together with cup, saucer, spoon and napkin.

"Say, sweetheart," he whispered, "I want to tell you something. My
mother isn't always like this. She can be very sweet when she wants
to. But when things don't go to suit her she takes these awful icy
'dignity' tantrums, and you can't touch her with a ten-foot pole until
she gets over them. She was tired, from the journey, and the fact that
you kept her waiting in the taxicab made her furious. But she'll get
over it. Just be patient, won't you, darling?"

If the average husband only realized how he could play upon his wife's
heart-strings with a few loving words I believe there would be less
marital unhappiness in the world. A few minutes before I had been
fiercely resentful against Dicky's mother. And my anger had reached
to Dicky, for I felt in some vague way that he must be responsible for
his mother's rudeness.

But the knowledge that he, too, was used to her injustice and that he
resented it when directed against me made all the difference in the
world. I reached up my hand and patted his cheek.

"Dear boy, nothing in the world matters, if _you_ aren't cross and
displeased."


XIV

A QUARREL AND A CRISIS


"Can you give me a few minutes' time, Dicky? I have something to tell
you."

Dicky put down the magazine with a bored air. "What is it?" he asked
shortly.

Involuntarily my thoughts flew back to the exquisite courtesy which
had always been Dicky's in the days before we were married. There
had been such a delicate reverence in his every tone and action. I
wondered if marriage changed all men as it had changed my husband.

I went to my room and brought the letter back to Dicky. He read it
through, and I saw his face grow blacker with each word. When he came
to the signature, he turned back to the beginning and read the epistle
through again. Then he crumpled it into a ball and threw it violently
across the room.

"See here, my lady," he exploded. "I think it's about time we came to
a show-down over this business. When I found that first letter from
this lad, I asked you if he were a relative, and you said 'No.' Then
you hand me this touching screed with its 'nearest of kin' twaddle,
and speaking of leaving you a fortune. For example: A man questions his own existence; he applies first
to the court of mother-wit and is promptly told that he exists; he
appeals next to reason and, after some wrangling, is told that the
matter is very doubtful; he proceeds to the equity of that reasonable
faith which inspires and transcends reason, and the judgment of the
court of first instance is upheld while that of reason is reversed.

Nevertheless it is folly to appeal from reason to faith unless one
is pretty sure of a verdict and, in most cases about which we
dispute seriously, reason is as far as we need go.

The Credit System

The whole world is carried on on the credit system; if every one
were to demand payment in hard cash, there would be universal
bankruptcy.

We think as we do mainly because other people think so. But if every one
stands on every one else, what does the bottom man stand on?
Faith is no foundation, for it rests in the end on reason. Reason is
no foundation, for it rests upon faith.

Argument

We are not won by argument, which is like reading and writing and
disappears when there is need of such vanity, or like colour that
vanishes with too much light or shade, or like sound that becomes
silence in the extremes.

Argument is useless when there is either no conviction at all or a
very strong conviction.

It is a means of conviction and as such belongs to the means of
conviction, not to the extremes.

We are not won by arguments that we can analyse, but by tone and temper,
by the manner which is the man himself.

Logic and Philosophy

When you have got all the rules and all the lore of philosophy and logic
well into your head, and have spent years in getting to understand
at any rate what they mean and have them at command, you will know
less for practical purposes than one who has never studied logic
or philosophy.

Science

If it tends to thicken the crust of ice on which, as it were, we
are skating, it is all right. If it tries to find, or professes to
have found, the solid ground at the bottom of the water, it is
all wrong.
Our business is with the thickening of this crust by extending our
knowledge downward from above, as ice gets thicker while the frost
lasts; we should not try to freeze upwards from the bottom.

Religion

A religion only means something so certainly posed that nothing can ever
displace it.

It is an attempt to settle first principles so authoritatively
that no one need so much as even think of ever re- opening them
for himself or feel any, even the faintest, misgiving upon the matter.
It is an attempt to get an irrefragably safe investment, and this
cannot be got, no matter how low the interest, which in the case
of religion is about as low as it can be.

Any religion that cannot be founded on half a sheet of note-paper will
be bottom-heavy, and this, in a matter so essentially of sentiment
as religion, is as bad as being top-heavy in a material construction.

It must of course catch on to reason, but the less it emphasises the
fact the better.

Logic

Logic has no place save with that which can be defined in words.
It has nothing to do, therefore, with those deeper questions that
have got beyond words and consciousness.

To apply logic here is as fatuous as to disregard it in cases where it
is applicable. The difficulty lies, as it always does, on the border
lines between the respective spheres of influence.

Logic and Faith

Logic is like the sword--those who appeal to it shall perish by it.
Faith is appealing to the living God, and one may perish by that
too, but somehow one would rather perish that way than the other,
and one has got to perish sooner or later.

Common Sense and Philosophy

The voices of common sense and of high philosophy sometimes cross; but
common sense is the unalterable canto fermo and philosophy is the
variable counterpoint.

First Principles

It is said we can build no superstructure without a foundation of
unshakable principles.

There are no such principles. Or, if there be any, they are beyond our
reach--we cannot fathom them; therefore, qua us, they have no
existence, for there is no other "is not" than inconceivableness
by ourselves.

There is one thing certain, namely, that we can have nothing certain;
therefore it is not certain that we can have nothing certain.

We are as men who will insist on looking over the brink of a
precipice; some few can gaze into the abyss below without losing
their heads, but most men will grow dizzy and fall.

The only thing to do is to glance at the chaos on which our thoughts
are founded, recognise that it is a chaos and that, in the nature
of things, no theoretically firm ground is even conceivable, and
then to turn aside with the disgust, fear and horror of one who has
been looking into his own entrails.

Even Euclid cannot lay a demonstrable premise, he requires postulates
and axioms which transcend demonstration and without which he can
do nothing.

His superstructure is demonstration, his ground is faith.
And so his ultima ratio is to tell a man that he is a fool by saying
"Which is absurd."

If his opponent chooses to hold out in spite of this, Euclid can do no
more. Faith and authority are as necessary for him as for any one else.
True, he does not want us to believe very much; his yoke is tolerably
easy, and he will not call a man a fool until he will have public
opinion generally on his side; but none the less does he begin
with dogmatism and end with persecution.

There is nothing one cannot wrangle about. Sensible people will agree
to a middle course founded upon a few general axioms and propositions
about which, right or wrong, they will not think it worth while
to wrangle for some time, and those who reject these can be put into
mad-houses. The middle way may be as full of hidden rocks as the other
ways are of manifest ones, but it is the pleasantest while we can
keep to it and the dangers, being hidden, are less alarming.

In practice it is seldom very hard to do one's duty when one knows
what it is, but it is sometimes exceedingly difficult to find this
out.

The difficulty is, however, often reducible into that of knowing what
gives one pleasure, and this, though difficult, is a safer guide
and more easily distinguished.

In all cases of doubt, the promptings of a kindly disposition are
more trustworthy than the conclusions of logic, and sense is better
than science.

Why I should have been at the pains to write such truisms I know
not.

XXI--REBELLIOUSNESS

God and Life

We regard these as two distinct things and say that the first made the
second, much as, till lately, we regarded memory and heredity as
two distinct things having less connection than even that supposed
to exist between God and life.

Now, however, that we know heredity to be only a necessary outcome,
development and manifestation of memory- -so that, given such a faculty
as memory, the faculty of heredity follows as being inherent therein
and bound to issue from it--in like manner presently, instead of
seeing life as a thing created by God, we shall see God and life
as one thing, there being no life without God nor God without life,
where there is life there is God and where there is God there is
life.

They say that God is love, but life and love are co-extensive; for
hate is but a mode of love, as life and death lurk always in one
another; and "God is life" is not far off saying "God is love." Again,
they say, "Where there is life there is hope," but hope is of the
essence of God, for it is faith and hope that have underlain all
evolution.

God and Flesh

The course of true God never did run smooth. God to be of any use must
be made manifest, and he can only be made manifest in and through
flesh. And flesh to be of any use (except for eating) must be
alive, and it can only be alive by being inspired of God. The trouble
lies in the getting the flesh and the God together in the right
proportions. There is lots of God and lots of flesh, but the flesh
has always got too much God or too little, and the God has always
too little flesh or too much.

Gods and Prophets
It is the manner of gods and prophets to begin: "Thou shalt have
none other God or Prophet but me."

If I were to start as a god or a prophet, I think I should take the
line:

"Thou shalt not believe in me. Thou shalt not have me for a god.
Thou shalt worship any damned thing thou likest except me." This should
be my first and great commandment, and my second should be like unto
it. {333} 

Faith and Reason
The instinct towards brushing faith aside and being strictly
reasonable is strong and natural; so also is the instinct towards
brushing logic and consistency on one side if they become troublesome,
in other words--so is the instinct towards basing action on a faith
which is beyond reason.

It is because both instincts are so natural that so many accept and
so many reject Catholicism.

The two go along for some time as very good friends and then fight;
sometimes one beats and sometimes the other, but they always make
it up again and jog along as before, for they have a great respect
for one another.

God and the Devil
God's merits are so transcendent that it is not surprising his
faults should be in reasonable proportion.

The faults are, indeed, on such a scale that, when looked at without
relation to the merits with which they are interwoven, they become
so appalling that people shrink from ascribing them to the Deity and
have invented the Devil, without seeing that there would be more
excuse for God's killing the Devil, and so getting rid of evil,
than there can be for his failing to be everything that he would
like to be.

For God is not so white as he is painted, and he gets on better
with the Devil than people think. The Devil is too useful for him to
wish him ill and, in like manner, half the Devil's trade would be at
an end should any great mishap bring God well down in the world.

For all the mouths they make at one another they play into each
other's hands and have got on so well as partners, playing Spenlow
and Jorkins to one another, for so many years that there seems no
reason why they should cease to do so.

The conception of them as the one absolutely void of evil and the
other of good is a vulgar notion taken from science whose priests
have ever sought to get every idea and every substance pure of all
alloy.

God and the Devil are about as four to three. There is enough preponderance
of God to make it far safer to be on his side than on the Devil's,
but the excess is not so great as his professional claqueurs pretend
it is.

It is like gambling at Monte Carlo; if you play long enough you are
sure to lose, but now and again you may win a great deal of excellent
money if you will only cease playing the moment you have won it.

Christianity

i

As an instrument of warfare against vice, or as a tool for making
virtue, Christianity is a mere flint implement.

ii
Christianity is a woman's religion, invented by women and womanish men
for themselves. The Church's one foundation is not Christ, as is
commonly said, it is woman; and calling the Madonna the Queen of
Heaven is only a poetical way of acknowledging that women are the
main support of the priests.

iii

It is not the church in a village that is the source of the mischief,
but the rectory. I would not touch a church from one end of England
to the other.

iv
Christianity is only seriously pretended by some among the idle,
bourgeois middle-classes. The working classes and the most
cultured intelligence of the time reach by short cuts what the
highways of our schools and universities mislead us from by many a
winding bout, if they do not prevent our ever reaching it.

v
It is not easy to say which is the more obvious, the antecedent
improbability of the Christian scheme and miracles, or the breakdown
of the evidences on which these are supposed to rest.

And yet Christianity has overrun the world.

vi

If there is any moral in Christianity, if there is anything to
be learned from it, if the whole story is not profitless from first
to last, it comes to this that a man should back his own opinion
against the world's--and this is a very risky and immoral thing to
do, but the Lord hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.

vii
Christianity is true in so far as it has fostered beauty and false in
so far as it has fostered ugliness. It is therefore not a little true
and not a little false.

viii

Christ said he came not to destroy but to fulfil--but he destroyed more
than he fulfilled. Every system that is to live must both destroy
and fulfil.

Miracles

They do more to unsettle faith in the existing order than to settle
it in any other; similarly, missionaries are more valuable as
underminers of old faiths than as propagators of new.

Miracles are not impossible; nothing is impossible till we have got
an incontrovertible first premise.

The question is not "Are the Christian miracles possible?" but
"Are they convenient?

Do they fit comfortably with our other ideas?"

Wants and Creeds

As in the organic world there is no organ, so in the world of thought
there is no thought, which may not be called into existence by long
persistent effort.

If a man wants either to believe or disbelieve the Christian miracles
he can do so if he tries hard enough; but if he does not care whether
he believes or disbelieves and simply wants to find out which side
has the best of it, this he will find a more difficult matter.

Nevertheless he will probably be able to do this too if he tries.

Faith

i

The reason why the early Christians held faith in such account was
because they felt it to be a feat of such superhuman difficulty.

ii

You can do very little with faith, but you can do nothing without
it.

iii
We are all agreed that too much faith is as bad as too little, and
too little as bad as too much; but we differ as to what is too much
and what too little.

iv

It is because both Catholics and myself make faith, not reason, the
basis of our system that I am able to be easy in mind about not
becoming a Catholic.

Not that I ever wanted to become a Catholic, but I mean I believe I can
beat them with their own weapons.

v
A man may have faith as a mountain, but he will not be able to say to a
grain of mustard seed: "Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the
sea"--not at least with any effect upon the mustard seed--unless
he goes the right way to work by putting the mustard seed into his
pocket and taking the train to Brighton.

vi
The just live by faith, but they not infrequently also die by it.

The Cuckoo and the Moon

The difference between the Christian and the Mahomedan is only as
the difference between one who will turn his money when he first
hears the cuckoo, but thinks it folly to do so on seeing the new
moon, and one who will turn it religiously at the new moon, but
will scout the notion that he need do so on hearing the cuckoo.

Buddhism

This seems to be a jumble of Christianity and Life and Habit.

Theist and Atheist

The fight between them is as to whether God shall be called God or
shall have some other name.

The Peculiar People

The only people in England who really believe in God are the Peculiar
People.

Perhaps that is why they are called peculiar.

See how belief in an anthropomorphic God divides allegiance and disturbs
civil order as soon as it becomes vital.

Renan

There is an article on him in the Times, April 30, 1883, of the
worst Times kind, and that is saying much. It appears he whines about
his lost faith and professes to wish that he could believe as he
believed when young. No sincere man will regret having attained a
truer view concerning anything which he has ever believed.

And then he talks about the difficulties of coming to disbelieve
the Christian miracles as though it were a great intellectual feat.

This is very childish.

I hope no one will say I was sorry when I found out that there was
no reason for believing in heaven and hell. My contempt for Renan
has no limits. (Has he an accent to his name? I despise him too much
to find out.)

The Spiritual Treadmill

The Church of England has something in her liturgy of the spiritual
treadmill. It is a very nice treadmill no doubt, but Sunday after
Sunday we keep step with the same old "We have left undone that which
we ought to have done; And we have done those things which we ought
not to have done" without making any progress.

With the Church of Rome, I understand that those whose piety is
sufficiently approved are told they may consider themselves as a
finished article and that, except on some few rare festivals, they
need no longer keep on going to church and confessing.

The picture is completed and may be framed, glazed and hung up.

The Dim Religious Light

A light cannot be religious if it is not dim.

Religion belongs to the twilight of our thoughts, just as
business of all kinds to their full daylight. So a picture which
may be impressive while seen in a dark light will not hold its own
in a bright one.

The Greeks and Romans did not enquire into the evidences on which
their belief that Minerva sprang full-armed from the brain of
Jupiter was based.

"When he came to the apartment," Dicky went on, "I was just about as
nearly insane as a man could be. I had no idea where you had gone and
I had just had the devil's own time with my mother and Katie over your
sudden departure."

"What did your mother say to all this?"

I asked the question timorously.

Dicky laughed. "Well! of course she didn't go into raptures over
the affair," he said, "but I think she learned a lesson. At least I
endeavored to help her learn one. I read the riot act to her after you
left."

"Oh! Dicky!" I protested, "that was hardly fair?"

"I know it," he admitted shamefacedly. "I am afraid I did rather take
it out on the mater when I found you had really gone. But she deserved
a good deal of it. You have done everything in your power to make
things pleasant for her since she came, and she has treated you about
as shabbily as was possible."

"Oh! not that bad, Dicky," I protested again, but I knew in my heart
that what he said was true. His mother had treated me most unfairly.
I could not help a little malicious thrill of pleasure that he had
finally resented it for me.

"Just that bad, little Miss Forgiveness," Dicky returned, smiling at
me tenderly.

My heart leaped at the words. When Dicky is in good humor he coins all
sorts of tender names for me. I knew that to Dicky our quarrel was as
if it had never happened.

"I'll give you a pointer about mother, Madge," Dicky went on. "When
you see her, act as if nothing had happened at all, it's the only
way to manage her. She can be most charming when she wants to be,
but every once in a while she takes one of those silent tantrums, and
there is no living with her until she gets over it."

I didn't make any comment on this speech, fearing to say the wrong
thing.

"But I didn't start to tell you about Katie." Dicky switched the
subject determinedly. "I might as well get it off my chest. When your
cousin came in and introduced himself the first thing I did was to
attempt to strike him."

"Oh, Dicky, Dicky," I moaned, horrified, "what did he do?"

Dicky's lips twisted grimly.

"Just put out his hand and caught my arm, saying with that calm and
quiet voice of his:

"'I shall not return any blow you may give me, Mr. Graham, so please
do not do anything you will regret when you recover yourself!'

"I realized his strength of body and the grip he had on my arm and
even my half-crazed brain recognized the power of his spirit. I came
to, apologized, and we had a long talk that made me realize what a
thundering good fellow he must be.

"I don't see why you never fell in love with him," Dicky continued.
"He's a better man than I am," he paraphrased half wistfully.

"But I love YOU," I whispered.

Across Dicky's face there fell a shadow. I realized that thoughtlessly
I had wounded him.


XVI

INTERRUPTED SIGHT-SEEING


"Margaret!" My mother-in-law's tone was almost tragic. "Richard has
gone off with my trunk checks."

"Why, of course, he has," I returned, wondering a little at her
anxious tone. "I suppose he expects to give them to an expressman and
have the trunks brought up this morning."

"Richard never remembered anything in his life," said his mother
tartly. "Those trunks ought to be here before I leave for the day."

"Oh, I don't think it would be possible for them to arrive here before
we have to start, even if Dicky gives them to an expressman right
away, as I am sure he will do."

It seemed queer to be defending Dicky to his mother, but I felt a
curious little thrill of resentment that she should criticise him.
I sometimes may judge Dicky harshly myself, but I don't care to hear
criticism of him from any other lips, even those of his mother.

"Richard will carry those checks in his pocket until he comes home
again, if he is lucky enough not to lose them," said his mother
decidedly. "I wish you would telephone him at his studio and remind
him that they must be looked after."

Obediently I went to the telephone. I knew Dicky had had plenty
of time to get to the studio, as it was but a short walk from our
apartment.

"Madison Square 3694," I said in answer to Central's request for
"number."

When the answer came I almost dropped the receiver in my surprise. It
was not Dicky's voice that came to my ears, but that of a stranger, a
woman's voice, rich and musical.

"Yes?" with a rising inflection, "this is Mr. Graham's studio. He has
not yet reached here. What message shall I give him, please, when he
comes in?"

"Please ask him to call up his home." Then I hung up the receiver and
turned from the telephone, putting down my agitation with a firm hand
until I could be alone.

"Dicky has not yet reached the studio," I said to his mother calmly.
"I think very probably he has gone first to see an expressman about
your trunks. If you will pardon me I have a few things to attend to
before we start on our trip. Is there anything I can do for you?"

"No, thank you." Mrs. Graham's tone was still the cold, courteous one
that she used in addressing me. "I suppose I can ring for Katie when I
am ready to have my dress fastened?"

"Oh! by all means," I returned. I thought bitterly of the little
services I used to perform for my own mother. How gladly I would
anticipate the wants of Dicky's mother if she would only show me
affection instead of the ill-concealed aversion with which she
regarded me.

My mother-in-law went into her room, and I, walking swiftly to mine,
closed and locked the door behind me. I threw myself face downward on
the bed, my favorite posture when I wished to think things out.

The voice of the woman at the studio haunted me. It was strange, but
familiar, and I could not remember where I had heard it.

What was a woman doing in Dicky's studio at this time in the morning,
anyway? I knew that Dicky employed feminine models, but I also knew
that he always made it a point to be at the studio before the model
was due to arrive.

"I suppose I am an awful crank," he had laughed once, "but no models
rummaging among my things for mine."

I knew that Dicky employed no secretary, or at least he had told me
that he did not I had heard him laughingly promise himself that when
his income reached $10,000 a year he would hire one.

All at once the solution to the mystery dawned upon me. The rich,
musical voice belonged to Grace Draper, the beautiful girl whom Dicky
had seen first on a train on our memorable trip to Marvin.

Why hadn't Dicky told me that she was at the studio? The question
rankled in the back of my brain.

That was not my main concern, however. What swept me with a sudden
primitive emotion, which I know must be jealousy, was the picture
of that beautiful face, that wonderful figure in daily close
companionship with my husband.

Suppose she should fall in love with Dicky! To my mind I did not
see how any woman could help it. Would she have any scruples about
endeavoring to win Dicky's love from me?

My common sense told me that this was the veriest nonsense. But I
could no more help my feelings than I could control the shape of my
nose.

The ring of the telephone bell put a temporary end to my speculations.
I pulled myself together in order to talk calmly to Dicky, for I knew
it must be he who was calling.

"Madge, is this you? Whatever has happened?"

"Nothing is the matter," I said quickly, "but you have your mother's
trunk checks, and she is anxious about them."

"By Jove!" Dicky's voice was full of consternation. "I forgot
everything about those trunk checks until this minute. I should
have attended to them yesterday, but"--he hesitated, then finished
lamely--"I didn't have time."

I felt my face flush as though Dicky could see me. The reason why
he did not have time to see to his mother's trunks on the day of her
arrival, touched a subject any allusion to which would always bring a
flush to my face.

I was still too shaken with the varying emotions I had experienced the
day before to bear well any reference to them, no matter how casual.
Fortunately, Dicky was too much taken up with his own remissness to
notice my silence.

"I'll go out this minute and attend to them," he said. "Try to keep
the mater's mind diverted from them if you can. Better get her away on
your sight-seeing trip as soon as possible."

Having thus shifted his responsibilities to my shoulders, Dicky
blithely hung up the receiver. I turned to his mother.

"Well!" she demanded.

"He is going out now to attend to the trunks," I said.

"There! I knew he had forgotten them," she exclaimed, with a little
malicious feminine triumph running through her tones. "When will they
be here?"

"Not before noon at the earliest," I repeated Dicky's words in as
matter-of-fact way as possible. "Probably not until 2 or 3 o'clock in
the afternoon. We might as well start on our trip. Katie is perfectly
capable of attending to them."

Then she said, "How soon will you be ready?"

"I am afraid it will be half an hour before I can start," I said
apologetically.

"That will be all right," my mother-in-law returned good humoredly.
The method I have described for the observation of Mercury will
prove very useful in the search for Venus when the sun is above the
horizon or but just set.

Of course, when an object is to be looked for high above the horizon,
the two rods which support the cross-rods must not be upright, but
square to the line of view to that part of the sky.

But the observer must not expect to see much during his observation
of Venus.

In fact, he can scarcely do more than note her varying phases (see Plate
6) and the somewhat uneven boundary of the terminator. Our leading
observers have done so little with this fascinating but disappointing
planet, that amateurs must not be surprised at their own failure.

I suppose the question whether Venus has a satellite, or at any
rate whether the object supposed to have been seen by Cassini and
other old observers were a satellite, must be considered as decided
in the negative.

That Cassini should have seen an object which Dawes and Webb have
failed to see must be considered utterly improbable.

Leaving the inferior planets, we come to a series of important and
interesting objects.

First we have the planet Mars, nearly the last in the scale of planetary
magnitude, but far from being the least interesting of the planets.
It is in fact quite certain that we obtain a better view of Mars
than of any object in the heavens, save the Moon alone.

He may present a less distinguished appearance than Jupiter or
Saturn, but we see his surface on a larger scale than that of
either of those giant orbs, even if we assume that we ever obtain a
fair view of their real surface.

Nor need the moderately armed observer despair of obtaining interesting
views of Mars.

The telescope with which Beer and Mädler made their celebrated series
of views was only a 4-inch one, so that with a 3-inch or even a
2-inch aperture the attentive observer may expect interesting views.
In fact, more depends on the observer than on the instrument.

A patient and attentive scrutiny will reveal features which at the
first view wholly escape notice.

In Plate 6 I have given a series of views of Mars much more distinct
than an observer may expect to obtain with moderate powers. I add
a chart of Mars, a miniature of one I have prepared from a charming
series of tracings supplied me by Mr.

Dawes. The views taken by this celebrated observer in 1852, 1856, 1860,
1862, and 1864, are far better than any others I have seen. The views
by Beer and Mädler are good, as are some of Secchi's (though they
appear badly drawn), Nasmyth's and Phillips'; Delarue's two views
are also admirable; and Lockyer has given a better set of views
than any of the others.

But there is an amount of detail in Mr. Dawes' views which renders
them superior to any yet taken.
I must confess I failed at a first view to see the full value of Mr.

Dawes' tracings.

Faint marks appeared, which I supposed to be merely intended to
represent shadings scarcely seen. A more careful study shewed me
that every mark is to be taken as the representative of what Mr.

Dawes actually saw. The consistency of the views is perfectly
wonderful, when compared with the vagueness and inconsistency
observable in nearly all other views.

And this consistency is not shown by mere resemblance, which might have
been an effect rather of memory (unconsciously exerted) than
observation.

The same feature changes so much in figure, as it appears on different
parts of the disc, that it was sometimes only on a careful projection
of different views that I could determine what certain features
near the limb represented.

But when this had been done, and the distortion through the effect of
foreshortening corrected, the feature was found to be as true in
shape as if it had been seen in the centre of the planet's disc.

In examining Mr. Dawes' drawings it was necessary that the position
of Mars' axis should be known.

The data for determining this were taken from Dr. Oudemann's
determinations given in a valuable paper on Mars issued from Mr.

Bishop's observatory. But instead of calculating Mars' presentation
by the formulæ there given, I found it convenient rather to make
use of geometrical constructions applied to my 'Charts of the Terrestrial
Planets.' Taking Mädler's start-point for Martial longitudes, that
is the longitude-line passing near Dawes' forked bay, I found that
my results agreed pretty fairly with those in Prof.

Phillips' map, so far as the latter went; but there are many details in
my charts not found in Prof. Phillips' nor in Mädler's earlier charts.

I have applied to the different features the names of those observers
who have studied the physical peculiarities presented by Mars.

Mr.
Dawes' name naturally occurs more frequently than others. Indeed,
if I had followed the rule of giving to each feature the name of
its discoverer, Mr. Dawes' name would have occurred much more frequently
than it actually does.

On account of the eccentricity of his orbit, Mars is seen much better
in some oppositions than in others. When best seen the southern
hemisphere is brought more into view than the northern because the
summer of his northern hemisphere occurs when he is nearly in
aphelion (as is the case with the Earth by the way).

The relative dimensions and presentation of Mars, as seen in
opposition in perihelion, and in opposition in aphelion, are shown in
the two rows of figures.

In and near quadrature Mars is perceptibly gibbous. He is seen thus
about two months before or after opposition.

In the former case, he rises late and comes to the meridian six hours
or so after midnight. In the latter case, he is well seen in the
evening, coming to the meridian at six. His appearance and relative
dimensions as he passes from opposition to quadrature are shown in
the last three figures of the upper row.

Mars' polar caps may be seen with very moderate powers.

I add four sets of meridians (Plate 6), by filling in which from the
charts the observer may obtain any number of views of the planet as
it appears at different times.

Passing over the asteroids, which are not very interesting
objects to the amateur telescopist, we come to Jupiter, the giant
of the solar system, surpassing our Earth more than 1400 times in
volume, and overweighing all the planets taken together twice over.

Jupiter is one of the easiest of all objects of telescopic observation.

No one can mistake this orb when it shines on a dark sky, and only Venus
can be mistaken for it when seen as a morning or evening star. Sometimes
both are seen together on the twilight sky, and then Venus is
generally the brighter. Seen, however, at her brightest and at her
greatest elongation from the sun, her splendour scarcely exceeds that
with which Jupiter shines when high above the southern horizon at
midnight.

Jupiter's satellites may be seen with very low powers; indeed the
outer ones have been seen with the naked eye, and all are visible
in a good opera-glass.

Their dimensions relatively to the disc are shown in Plate 7.

Their greatest elongations are compared with the disc in the low-power
view.

Jupiter's belts may also be well seen with moderate telescopic power.

The outer parts of his disc are perceptibly less bright than the
centre.

More difficult of observation are the transits of the satellites
and of their shadows.

Still the attentive observer can see the shadows with an aperture
of two inches, and the satellites themselves with an aperture of
three inches.

The minute at which the satellites enter on the disc, or pass off, is
given in 'Dietrichsen's Almanac.' The 'Nautical Almanac' also gives the
corresponding data for the shadows.

The eclipses of the satellites in Jupiter's shadow, and their occultations
by his disc, are also given in 'Dietrichsen's Almanac.'
In the inverting telescope the satellites move from right to left
in the nearer parts of their orbit, and therefore transit Jupiter's
disc in that direction, and from left to right in the farther parts.

Also note that _before_ opposition, (i.) the shadows travel in front of
the satellites in transiting the disc; (ii.) the satellites are
eclipsed in Jupiter's _shadow_; (iii.) they reappear from behind his
_disc_.

On the other hand, _after_ opposition, (i.) the shadows travel _behind_
the satellites in transiting the disc; (ii.) the satellites are
occulted by the _disc_; (iii.) they reappear from eclipse in Jupiter's
_shadow_.

Conjunctions of the satellites are common phenomena, and may be waited
for by the observer who sees the chance. An eclipse of one satellite
by the shadow of another is not a common phenomenon; in fact, I have
never heard of such an eclipse being seen.

That a satellite should be quite extinguished by another's shadow
is a phenomenon not absolutely impossible, but which cannot happen
save at long intervals.

The shadows are not _black spots_ as is erroneously stated in nearly
all popular works on astronomy. The shadow of the fourth, for instance,
is nearly all penumbra, the really black part being quite minute
by comparison. The shadow of the third has a considerable penumbra,
and even that of the first is not wholly black. These penumbras may
not be perceptible, but they affect the appearance of the shadows. For
instance, the shadow of the fourth is perceptibly larger but less
black than that of the third, though the third is the larger
satellite.

In transit the first satellite moves fastest, the fourth slowest, the
others in their order. The shadow moves just as fast (appreciably)
as the satellite it belongs to. Sometimes the shadow of the satellite
may be seen to overtake (apparently) the disc of another.

In such a case the shadow does not pass over the disc, but the disc
conceals the shadow.
This is explained by the fact that the shadow, if visible throughout
its length, would be a line reaching slantwise from the satellite
it belongs to, and the end of the shadow (that is, the point where
it meets the disc) is _not_ the point where the shadow crosses the
orbit of any inner satellite.

Thus the latter may be interposed between the end of the shadow--the
only part of the shadow really visible--and the eye; but the end
of the shadow _cannot_ be interposed between the satellite and the
eye.

If a satellite _on the disc_ were eclipsed by another satellite, the
black spot thus formed would be in another place from the black spot
on the planet's body. I mention all this because, simple as
the question may seem, I have known careful observers to make mistakes
on this subject. A shadow is seen crossing the disc and overtaking,
apparently, a satellite in transit. It seems therefore, on a first view,
that the shadow will hide the satellite, and observers have even
said that they have _seen_ this happen.

But they are deceived.

It is obvious that _if one satellite eclipse another, the shadows
of both must occupy the same point on Jupiter's body_.

Thus it is the overtaking of one _shadow_ by another on the disc,
and not the overtaking of a _satellite_ by a shadow, which determines
the occurrence of that as yet unrecorded phenomenon, the eclipse of
one satellite by another.[13]
The satellites when far from Jupiter seem to lie in a straight line
through his centre.

But as a matter of fact they do not in general lie in an exact straight
line.

If their orbits could be seen as lines of light, they would appear,
in general, as very long ellipses.

The orbit of the fourth would frequently be seen to be _quite clear_
of Jupiter's disc, and the orbit of the third might in some very
exceptional instances pass _just_ clear of the disc.

The satellites move most nearly in a straight line (apparently) when
Jupiter comes to opposition in the beginning of February or August, and
they appear to depart most from rectilinear motion when opposition
occurs in the beginning of May and November. At these epochs the fourth
satellite may be seen to pass above and below Jupiter's disc at a
distance equal to about one-sixth of the disc's radius.

The shadows do not travel in the same apparent paths as the satellites
themselves across the disc, but (in an inverting telescope) _below_
from August to January, and _above_ from February to July.

We come now to the most charming telescopic object in the heavens--the
planet Saturn.

Inferior only to Jupiter in mass and volume, this planet surpasses
him in the magnificence of his system. Seen in a telescope of adequate
power, Saturn is an object of surpassing loveliness. He must be an
unimaginative man who can see Saturn for the first time in such a
telescope, without a feeling of awe and amazement.

If there is any object in the heavens--I except not even the Sun--calculated
to impress one with a sense of the wisdom and omnipotence of the
Creator it is this. "His fashioning hand" is indeed visible throughout
space, but in Saturn's system it is most impressively manifest.

Saturn, to be satisfactorily seen, requires a much more powerful
telescope than Jupiter. A good 2-inch telescope will do much, however,
in exhibiting his rings and belts. I have never seen him
satisfactorily myself with such an aperture, but Mr. Grover has
not only seen the above-named features, but even a penumbra to the
shadow on the rings with a 2-inch telescope.

Saturn revolving round the sun in a long period--nearly thirty
years--presents slowly varying changes of appearance (see Plate 7).
At one time the edge of his ring is turned nearly towards the earth;
seven or eight years later his rings are as much open as they can
ever be; then they gradually close up during a corresponding interval;
open out again, exhibiting a different face; and finally close up
as first seen.

The last epoch of greatest opening occurred in 1856, the next occurs
in 1870: the last epoch of disappearance occurred in 1862-63, the
next occurs in 1879.

The successive views obtained are as in Plate 7 in order from right
to left, then back to the right-hand figure (but sloped the other way);
inverting the page we have this figure thus sloped, and the following
changes are now indicated by the other figures in order back to
the first (but sloped the other way and still inverted), thus
returning to the right-hand figure as seen without inversion.

The division in the ring can be seen in a good 2-inch aperture in
favourable weather. The dark ring requires a good 4-inch and good
weather.

Saturn's satellites do not, like Jupiter's, form a system of nearly equal
bodies. Titan, the sixth, is probably larger than any of Jupiter's
satellites. The eighth also (Japetus) is a large body, probably at
least equal to Jupiter's third satellite.

But Rhea, Dione, and Tethys are much less conspicuous, and the other
three cannot be seen without more powerful telescopes than those we
are here dealing with.

So far as my own experience goes, I consider that the five larger
satellites may be seen distinctly in good weather with a good
3-1/2-inch aperture.

I have never seen them with such an aperture, but I judge from the
distinctness with which these satellites may be seen with a 4-inch
aperture.

Titan is generally to be looked for at a considerable distance
from Saturn--_always_ when the ring is widely open. Japetus is
to be looked for yet farther from the disc.
But my native
caution made me make a reservation. I would yield to her wishes
whenever my self-respect would let me do so. I had a shrewd notion
that a person who would cater to every whim of my husband's mother
would be little better than a slave.

She spent so much time over the old letters in Washington's
handwriting, the snuff boxes and keys and coins with which the cases
were filled that I was alarmed lest she should over-tire herself. But
I did not dare to venture the suggestion that she should postpone her
inspection until another time.

But when I saw her shiver and draw her cloak more closely about her, I
resolved to brave her possible displeasure.

"I am afraid you are taking cold," I said, going up to her. "Do you
think we had better leave the rest of these things for another visit?"

Her face as she turned it toward me frightened me. It was gray and
drawn, and her whole figure was shaking as with the ague.

"I am afraid I am going to be ill," she said faintly. "I am so cold."

I put her in a chair and dashed down the stairs.

"Please call a taxi for me at once, and bring some brandy or wine
upstairs," I said to the attendant. "My mother-in-law is ill."

As the taxi hurried us homeward I became more and more alarmed at her
condition. Her very evident suffering now heightened my fears.

"Are we nearly there?" she said faintly. "I am so cold."

"Only a few blocks more." I tried to speak reassuringly. Then I
ventured on something which I had wanted to do ever since we left the
tavern, but which my mother-in-law's dislike of being aided in any way
had prevented.

I slipped off my coat, and, turning toward her, wrapped it closely
around her shoulders, and took her in my arms as I would a child. To
my surprise she huddled closer to me, only protesting faintly:

"You must not do that. You will take cold."

"Nonsense," I replied. "I never take cold, and we are almost there."

"I am so glad," she sighed, and leaned more heavily against me.

As I felt her weight in my arms and realized that she was actually
clinging to me, actually depending upon me for help and comfort, I
felt my heart warm toward her.

I have never worked faster in my life than when I helped my
mother-in-law undress before the blazing gas log, put her nightgown
and heavy bathrobe around her and immersed her feet in the foot bath
of hot mustard water which Katie had brought to me.

As I worked over her I came to a decision. I would get her safe and
warm in bed, leave Katie within call, then slip out and telephone
Dicky from the neighboring drug store. I did not dare to send for a
physician against my mother-in-law's expressed prohibition. On the
other hand, I knew that Dicky would be very angry if I did not send
for one.

The hot footbath and the steaming drink which I had given her when she
first came in, together with the warmth of the gas log seemed to make
my mother-in-law more comfortable. As I dried her feet and slipped
them into a pair of warm bedroom slippers she smiled down at me.

"At least I am not cold now," she said.

"Don't you think you had better come and lie down now?" I asked.

"Yes, I think it would be better," she asserted, and with Katie and me
upon either side, she walked into her room and got into bed.

I slipped the bedroom slippers off, put one hot water bag to her
feet and the other to her back, covered her up warmly and lowered the
shade.

Her eyes closed immediately. I stood watching her breathing for two or
three minutes. It was heavier, I fancied than normal. As I went out
of the room I spoke in a low tone to Katie, directing her to watch her
till I returned.

As I descended the stairs all the doubts of the morning rushed over
me. It was long after 2 o'clock, the hour when Dicky usually returned
to the studio. I had jumped at the conclusion that Dicky was lunching
with Grace Draper, the beautiful art student who was his model and
protégé.

It was not so much anger that I felt at Dicky's lunching with another
woman as fear. I faced the issue frankly. Grace Draper was much too
beautiful and attractive a girl to be thrown into daily intimate
companionship with any man. I felt in that moment that I hated her as
much as I feared her. I hoped that it would not be her voice which I
would hear over the 'phone. I felt that I could not bear to listen to
those deep, velvety tones of hers.

But when I reached the drug store and entered the telephone booth, it
was her voice which answered my call of Dicky's number.

"Yes, this is Mr. Graham's studio," she said smoothly. "No, Mr. Graham
is not here, he has not been here since 11 o'clock. Pardon me, is this
not Mrs. Graham to whom I am speaking?"

"I am Mrs. Graham, yes," I replied, trying to put a little cordiality
into my voice. "You are Miss Draper, are you not?"

"Yes," she replied. "Mr. Graham wished me to give you a message. He
was called away to a conference with one of the art editors about 11
o'clock. He expected to lunch with him and said he might not be in the
studio until quite late this afternoon."

"Have you any idea where he is lunching or where I could reach him?" I
asked sharply.

"Why! no, Mrs. Graham, I have not. Is there anything wrong?"

"His mother has been taken ill and I am very much worried about her.
If Mr. Graham comes in or telephones will you ask him to come home at
once, 'phoning me first if he will."

"Of course I will attend to it. Is there anything else I can do?"

"Nothing, thank you, you are very kind," I returned, and there was
genuine warmth in my voice this time.

For the discovery that I had been mistaken in my idea of Dicky's
luncheon engagement made me so ashamed of myself that I had no more
rancor against my husband's beautiful protégé.

I laughed bitterly at my own silliness as I turned from the telephone.
While I had been tormenting myself for hours at the picture I had
drawn of Dicky and his beautiful model lunching vis-a-vis, Dicky had
been keeping a prosaic business engagement with a man, and his model
had probably lunched frugally and unromantically on a sandwich or two
brought from home.


XVIII

"CALL ME MOTHER--IF YOU CAN"


"Will you kindly tell me who is the best physician here?"

"Why--I--pardon me--" the drug store clerk stammered. "Wait a moment
and I'll inquire. I'm new here."

"The boss says this chap's the best around here." He held out a
penciled card to me. "Dr. Pettit. Madison Square 4258."

"Dr. Pettit!" I repeated to myself. "Why! that must be the physician
who came to the apartment the night of my chafing dish party, when the
baby across the hall was brought to us in a convulsion."

A sudden swift remembrance came to me of the tact and firmness with
which the tall young physician had handled the difficult situation he
had found in our apartment. He was just the man, I decided, to handle
my refractory mother-in-law. So I called him up and he promised to
call as soon as his office hours were over.

My feet traveled no faster than my thoughts as I hurried back to
my own apartment and the bedside of my mother-in-law. I dreaded
inexpressibly the conflict I foresaw when the autocratic old woman
should find out that I had sent for a physician against her wishes.

As I entered the living room Katie rose from her seat at the door of
my mother-in-law's room.

"She not move while you gone," she said. "She sleep all time, but I
'fraid she awful seeck, she breathe so hard."

I went lightly into the bedroom and stood looking down upon the
austere old face against the pillow. It was a flushed old face now,
and the eyelids twitched as if there were pain somewhere in the body.
Her breathing, too, was more rapid and heavy than when I had left her,
or so I fancied.

My inability to do anything for her depressed me. By slipping my hand
under the blankets I had ascertained that the hot water bags were
sufficiently warm. There was nothing more for me to do but to sit
quietly and watch her until the physician's arrival.

I wanted to bring Dr. Pettit to her bedside before she should
awaken. Then I would let him deal with her obstinate refusal to see a
physician. But how I wished that Dicky would come home.

As if I had rubbed Aladdin's lamp, I heard the hall door slam, and my
husband came rushing into the room.

"What is the matter with mother?" Dicky demanded, his face and voice
filled with anxiety.

I sprang to him and put my hand to his lips, for he had almost shouted
the words.

"Hush! She is asleep," I whispered. "Don't waken her if you can help
it."

"Why isn't there a doctor here?" he demanded fiercely.

"Dr. Pettit will be here in a very few moments," I whispered rapidly.
"Your mother said she would not have a physician, but she appeared
so ill I did not dare to wait until your return to the studio. I
telephoned you, and when Miss Draper said she did not know where to
get you, I 'phoned to Dr. Pettit on my own authority."

"You don't think mother is in any danger, do you, Madge?"

"Why, I don't think I am a good judge of illness," I answered,
evasively, unwilling to hurt Dicky by the fear in my heart. "The
physician ought to be here any minute now, and then we will know."

A sharp, imperative ring of the bell and Katie's entrance punctuated
my words. Dicky started toward the door as Katie opened it to admit
the tall figure of Dr. Pettit.

"Ah, Dr. Pettit I believe we have met before," Dicky said easily.
"When Mrs. Graham spoke of you I did not remember that we had seen you
so recently. I am glad that we were able to get you."

"Thank you," the physician returned gravely. "Where is the patient?"

"In this room." Dicky turned toward the bedroom door, and Dr. Pettit
at once walked toward it. I mentally contrasted the two men as I
followed them to my mother-in-law's room. There was a charming ease
of manner about Dicky which the other man did not possess. He was,
in fact, almost awkward in his movements, and decidedly stiff in his
manner. But there was an appearance of latent strength in every
line of his figure, a suggestion of power and ability to cope with
emergencies. I had noticed it when he took charge of the baby in
convulsions who had been brought to my apartment by its nurse. I
marked it again as Dicky paused at the door of his mother's room.

"I don't know how you will manage, doctor." He smiled deprecatingly.
"My mother positively refuses to see a physician, but we know she
needs one."

"You are her nearest relative?" Dr. Pettit queried gravely, almost
formally. His question had almost the air of securing a legal right
for his entrance into the room.

"Oh, yes."

"Very well," and he stepped lightly to the side of the bed and stood
looking down upon the sick woman.

He took out his watch, and I knew he was counting her respirations.
Then, with the same impersonal air, he turned to Dicky.

"It will be necessary to rouse her. Will you awaken her, please? Do
not tell her I am here. Simply waken her."

Dicky bent over his mother and took her hand.

"Mother, what was it you wished me to get for you?"

The elder Mrs. Graham opened her eyes languidly.

"I told you quinine," she said impatiently. As she spoke, Dr. Pettit
reached past Dicky. His hand held a thermometer.

"Put this in your mouth, please." His air was as casual as if he had
made daily visits to her for a fortnight.

But the elder Mrs. Graham was not to be so easily routed. She scowled
up at him and half rose from her pillow.

"I do not wish a physician. I forbade having one called. I am not ill
enough for a physician."

Dr. Pettit put out his left hand and gently put her back again upon
her pillow. It was done so deftly that I do not think she realized
what he had done until she was again lying down.

"You must not excite yourself," he said, still in the same grave,
impersonal tone, "and you are more ill than you think. It is
absolutely necessary that I get your temperature and examine your
lungs at once."

As if the words had been a talisman of some sort, her opposition
dropped from her. Into her face came a frightened look.

"Oh, doctor, you don't think I am going to have pneumonia, do you?"

I was amazed at the cry. It was like that of a terrified child. Dr.
Pettit smiled down at her.

If an irradiation from one side is perceived, part of the object-glass
has not the same refractive power as the rest; and the fact, middle
morning is of a careful optician.

The latter defect may be detected by cutting out three circular cards
of suitable size with a aperture at the centre of each, and inserting
one at each end of the eye-tube, and one over the object-glass.

If the tube is rightly placed should be done by day--an arrangement
which has a twofold advantage,--the time the apertures will of course
lie in a right line, so that it will be to look through all
three at once. If not, it will be easy to determine towards what
part of the object-glass the is directed, and to correct the
position of the tube accordingly.

The best tests for determining the defining power of a telescope are
close double or multiple stars, the components of which are not
very unequal.

The illuminating power under the Pole-star of the inner air. When
a telescope is used out dew falls heavily upon it, unless the
radiation is in some way The dew-cap does this effectually.

It should be blackened within, especially if made objects he
proposes to examine. This available for observation is lengthened,
and the eyes are spared sudden changes from darkness to light
horizon. This end lies very near a star which it will be well for us
and again at the same hour one month later, we shall find that at the
latter observation( as compared with the former) the heavens appear
the to have rotated by the part_ of a complete girth, the appearance
presented is precisely the same as we should have observed had we
waited for two hours( the_twelfth part_ of a day) on the day of the
first monitoring.*** to become acquainted with rediscovery of the
is the Dragon's Head, a conspicuous diamond.

It is selected from Admiral Smyth's tests, obtained by diminishing
the aperture of life a 6-in. telescope having a focal length of
8-1/2 feet: A two-inch aperture, with powers of from 60 to 100,
should exhibit Piscium( 3"·5).

|[delta] Geminorum( 7"·1,| mag.( 4 and 9). The tests in the first,
column are for definition, those And in the second for illumination.

It will be noticed that star of less than the 9th magnitude, a
larger aperture is required to show the 8th magnitude component
of[sigma] Cassiopeiæ, on account of the greater closeness of this
double.

In favourable weather the following is a good general test of the
performance of a telescope:--A star of the 3rd or 4th magnitude
at a considerable elevation above the horizon should exhibit a small
well defined disc, surrounded by two or three fine rings of light.
A telescope should not be mounted within doors, if inversion not
being complete," a different method must be adopted it can be
conveniently erected on should be used.

Nothing but failure and annoyance can follow the attempt to employ
the highest powers on unsuitable objects or in unfavourable weather.
The greatest care should be taken the telescope can solid ground face
the south. Then all the stars on our left, that is, towards the east,
are of any kind round which currents of air likely to be produced. If
a telescope is used in a room, the temperature of the room should
be made as in darkness for a quarter of an hour.

Kitchener, indeed, goes so far as to recommend( with a_crede experto_)
an_interval of sleep_ in the darkness of the observing-room before
commencing operations.

I have never tried the experiment, but I should expect it to have a bad
rather than a good effect on the eyesight, as one commonly sees the
eyes of a person who has been sleeping in his day-clothes exclaimed
look light will be seen to wax and wane, heavy and bloodshot.

The object or the part comprehendingly of an object to be observed

Objects near the eastern horizon during the time of morning twilight
are especially confused by atmospheric undulations; in all objects.
The same rules which we have been there applying to refractors,
serve for reflectors.

The, performance of a reflector will be found to differ in some respects,
however, from that of a refractor. Mr. Dawes is, we believe, now engaged
in testing reflectors, and his unequalled experience of refractors
will of son a enable him to pronounce decisively on the relative
merits of the two classes of telescopes.

We have little to say respecting the construction of telescopes. Whether
it is advisable or not for an amateur observer to for observation,
there are instants of distinct vision( with moderate powers) during
which the careful observer may catch sight of important details;
and, similarly, in the best observing weather, there are moments

What he had done remained unknown, but ever after a wretched glare of

inversion of objects by the astronomical Neither method is correct.

The simple correction wanted is to hold the picture of a picture taken
by an Herschelian reflector, the. In fact, either of the above-named
processes, incorrect for the ordinary astronomical, would be correct
for the Herschelian there up Telescope.

The latter inverts but does not reverse right and left; therefore
after inverting our picture we must interchange right and left
because. The following introductory remarks are applicable to each:--
If we stand on an open space, on any clear night, we see above us
the celestial dome spangled with stars, apparently fixed in position.

But after a little time it a becomes clear that these orbs are slowly
shifting their position.

Those is through them that objects pass out of the field of view of
the telescope, and by moving the tube in a proper, direction we can
easily pick up an object that has thus passed away, whereas if we
are not familiar with near the eastern is, a tube of or pasteboard,
some, and concave surface of a vast hollow sphere and this sphere
rotated about an axis.

This axis, in our latitude, is and inclined about 51-1/2° to the horizon.
Of only one end of this imaginary axis can at the beginning of our
operations.

It lies almost exactly towards the north, and is raised from 50° to
53°( to the season and hour) above the horizon. There is an easy
know-how of finding it. We must first find the Greater Bear. It will
be seen from I Plate 1, that on a spring evening the seven conspicuous
stars of this constellation are to be looked for towards the north-east,

distance from the pointer[alpha] is rather more thing than three
times the distance of[alpha] from[beta].

Now stand facing the Pole-star. Then all the stars are travelling round

commenced during the first quarter of the year, at ten o'clock on the

the 19th of February, or at seven on the 6th of March, or at hours
intermediate to these on intermediate days.

described, and thence find the Pole-star Sirius unmistakeably overshining

Overhead is the brilliant Capella, near a very unfavourable time for

applying in different positions a cap which hides half, and the
defect will disappear when the glass is freed from such undue
pressure.

If the object-glass is not quite at right angles to the axis of the
tube, or if the eye-tube is it through, a authoritatively glare
of light will be seen within the tube.

Now, if the tube be slightly moved about, the according as the tube

On a summer's evening the Great Bear is nearly overhead. On an autumn

Finally, on a winter's evening, he is low down towards the north, the

.
It would kill her to take Marion away from her."

"You saw my pink room?" she demanded abruptly.

I nodded. The memory of that rose-colored nest and the look in my
hostess's eyes when on my other visit she had said she had prepared
the room for a young girl was yet vivid.

"I spent weeks preparing it for her when I heard of her father's
remarriage," she said, "When I finally realized that I could not have
her, I lay ill for weeks in it. On my recovery I vowed that no one
else but she or I should ever sleep there. I have another bedroom
where I sleep most of the time. But sometimes I go in there and spend
the night, and pretend that I have her little body snuggled up close
to me just as it used to be."

The crackling of the logs in the grate was the only sound to be heard
for many minutes.

With her elbow resting on the arm of her chair, her chin cupped in her
hand, her whole body leaning toward the warmth of the fire, she sat
gazing into the leaping flames as if she were trying to read in them
the riddle of the future.

I patiently waited on her mood. That she would open her heart to me
further I knew, but I did not wish to disturb her with either word or
movement.

"I might as well begin at the beginning." There was a note in her
voice that all at once made me see the long years of suffering which
had been hers. "Only the beginning is so commonplace that it lacks
interest. It is the record of a very mediocre stenographer with
aspirations."

That she was speaking of herself her tone told me, but I was genuinely
surprised. Mrs. Underwood was the last woman in the world one would
picture as holding down a stenographer's position.

"I can't remember when I didn't have in the back of my brain the idea
of learning to draw," she went on, "but it took years and years of
uphill work and saving to get a chance. I was an orphan, with nobody
to care whether I lived or died, and nothing but my own efforts to
depend on. But I stuck to it, working in the daytime and studying
evenings and holidays till at last I began to get a foothold, and then
when I had enough to put by to risk it I went to Paris."

Her voice was as matter of fact as if she were describing a visit to
the family butcher shop. But I visualized the busy, plucky years with
their reward of Paris as if I had been a spectator of them.

"Of course, by the time I got there I was almost old enough to be the
mother, or, at least, the elder sister of most of the boys and girls
I met, and I had learned life and experience in a good, hard school.
Some of the youngsters got the habit of coming to me with all their
troubles, fancied or real. I made some stanch friends in those days,
but never a stancher, truer one than Dicky Graham.

"Tell me, dear girl, when you were teaching those history classes, did
any of your boy pupils fall in love with you?"

I answered her with an embarrassed little laugh. Her question called
up memories of shy glances, gifts of flowers and fruit, boyish
confidences--all the things which fall to the lot of any teacher of
boys.

"Well, then, you will understand me when I tell you that in the studio
days in Paris Dicky imagined himself quite in love with me."

There was something in her tone and manner which took all the sting
out of her words for me. All the jealousy and real concern which I had
spent on this old attachment of my husband for Mrs. Underwood vanished
as I listened to her. She might have been Dicky's mother, speaking of
his early and injudicious fondness for green apples.

"I shall always be proud of the way I managed Dicky that time." Her
voice still held the amused maternal note. "It's so easy for an older
woman to spoil a boy's life in a case like that if she's despicable
enough to do it. But, you see, I was genuinely fond of Dicky, and
yet not the least bit in love with him, and I was able, without his
guessing it, to keep the management of the affair in my own hands.
So when he woke up, as boys always do, to the absurdity of the idea,
there was nothing in his recollections of me to spoil our friendship.

Dicky was really too ill to care what we did with him,
so we got him into bed, and I took care of him for two or three days
until he was well enough to leave.

"Of course, the greater part of his care fell on me, for Will's mother
was old and not strong. I am not going to tell you the accusations
which my unspeakable husband made against me, or the affidavits which
the maid was bribed to sign about Dicky and me. You can guess. Worst
of all, Will's mother turned against me, not because of anything she
had observed, but simply because her son told her I was guilty.

"'I never would have thought it of you, Lillian,' she said to me with
the tears streaming down her wrinkled, old face. 'I never saw anything
out of the way, but of course Will wouldn't lie. And I loved you so.'

"Poor old woman. Those last few words of affection made it easier for
me to give the baby up to her when the time came. She idolizes Marion.
She gives her the best of care, and I do not think she will teach her
to hate me as Will would.

"But there has never been a moment since I kissed Marion and gave her
into the arms of her grandmother that I have not known exactly how
she was treated," she said. "I have made it my business to know, and I
have paid liberally for the knowledge. You see, about the time of the
divorce Mr. Morten had a legacy left him, so that life has been easy
for him financially. His mother had always kept a maid. Every servant
she has had has been in my employ. There has scarcely been a day since
I lost my baby that from some unobserved place I have not seen her
in her walks. I know every line of her face, every curve of her body,
every trick of movement and expression. I shall know how to win her
love when the time comes, never fear."

Her voice was dauntless, but her face mirrored the anguish that must
be her daily companion.

One thing about her recital jarred upon me. This paying of servants,
this furtive espionage was not in keeping with the high resolve that
had led the mother to "keep her word" to the man who had ruined her
life. And yet--and yet--I dared not judge her. In her place I could
not imagine what I would have done.

One thing I knew. Never again would I doubt Lillian Underwood. The
ghost of the past romance between my husband and the woman before
me was laid for all time, never to trouble me again. Remembering
the sacrifice she had made for Dicky, considering the gallant fight
against circumstances she had waged since her girlhood, I felt
suddenly unworthy of the friendship she had so warmly offered me.

I turned to her, trying to find words, which should fittingly express
my sentiments, but she forestalled me with a kaleidoscopic change of
manner that bewildered me.

"Enough of horrors," she said, springing up and giving a little
expressive shake of her shoulders as if she were throwing a weight
from them. "I'm going to give you some luncheon."

"Oh, please!" I put up a protesting hand, but she was across the room
and pressing a bell before I could stop her.

I thought I understood. The grave of her past life was closed again.
She had opened it because she wished me to know the truth concerning
the old garbled stories about herself and Dicky. Having told me
everything, she had pushed the grisly thing back into its sepulchre
again and had sealed it. She would not refer to it again.

One thing puzzled me, something to which she had not referred--why had
she married Harry Underwood? Why, after the terrible experience of
her first marriage, had she risked linking her life with an unstable
creature like the man who was now her husband?

I put all questionings aside, however, and tried to meet her brave,
gay mood.


XX

LITTLE MISS SONNOT'S OPPORTUNITY


My mother-in-law's convalescence was as rapid as the progress of
her sudden illness had been. By the day that I gave my first history
lecture before the Lotus Study Club she was well enough to dismiss Dr.
Pettit with, one of her sudden imperious speeches, and to make plans
that evening for the welcoming and entertaining of her daughter
Harriet and her famous son-in-law Dr. Edwin Braithwaite, who were
expected next day on their way to Europe, where Doctor was to take
charge of a French hospital at the front.

That night I could not sleep. The exciting combination of happenings
effectually robbed me of rest. I tried every device I could think of
to go to sleep, but could not lose myself in even a doze. Finally, in
despair, I rose cautiously, not to awaken Dicky, and slipping on my
bathrobe and fur-trimmed mules, made my way into the dining-room.

Turning on the light, I looked around for something to read until I
should get sleepy.

"What is the matter, Mrs. Graham? Are you ill?"

Miss Sonnet's soft, voice sounded just behind me. As I turned I
thought again, as I had many times before, how very attractive the
little nurse was. She had on a dark blue negligee of rough cloth, made
very simply, but which covered her night attire completely, while
her feet, almost as small as a child's, were covered with fur-trimmed
slippers of the same color as the negligee. Her abundant hair was
braided in two plaits and hung down to her waist.

"You look like a sleepy little girl," I said impulsively.

"And you like a particularly wakeful one," she returned,
mischievously. "I am glad you are not ill. I feared you were when I
heard you snap on the light."

"No, you did not waken me. In fact, I have been awake nearly an hour.
I was just about to come out and rob the larder of a cracker and a sip
of milk in the hope that I might go to sleep again when I heard you."

"Splendid!" I ejaculated, while Miss Sonnot looked at me wonderingly.
"Can your patient hear us out here?"

"If you could hear her snore you would be sure she could not," Miss
Sonnot smiled. "And I partly closed her door when I left. She is safe
for hours."

"Then we will have a party," I declared triumphantly, "a regular
boarding school party."

"Then on to the kitchen!" She raised one of her long braids of hair
and waved it like a banner. We giggled like fifteen-year-old school
girls as we tiptoed our way into the kitchen, turned on the light and
searched refrigerator, pantry, bread and cake boxes for food.

"Now for our plunder," I said, as we rapidly inventoried the eatables
we had found. Bread, butter, a can of sardines, eggs, sliced bacon and
a dish of stewed tomatoes.

"I wish we had some oysters or cheese; then we could stir up something
in the chafing dish," I said mournfully.

"Do you know, I believe I have a chafing dish recipe we can use in a
scrap book which I always carry with me," responded Miss Sonnot. "It
is in my suit case at the foot of my couch. I'll be back in a minute."

She noiselessly slipped into the living room and returned almost
instantly with a substantially bound book in her hands. She sat down
beside me at the table and opened the book.

"I couldn't live without this book," she said extravagantly. "In it I
have all sorts of treasured clippings and jottings. The things I need
most I have pasted in. The chafing dish recipes are in an envelope. I
just happened to have them along."

She was turning the pages as she spoke. On one page, which she passed
by more hurriedly than the others, were a number of Kodak pictures. I
caught a flash of one which made my heart beat more quickly. Surely I
had a print from the same negative in my trunk.

The tiny picture was a photograph of Jack Bickett or I was very much
mistaken.

What was it doing in the scrap book of Miss Sonnot?

I put an unsteady hand out to prevent her turning the page.

It was Jack Bickett's photograph. I schooled my voice to a sort of
careless surprise:

"Why! Isn't this Jack Bickett?"

She started perceptibly. "Yes. Do you know him?"

"He is the nearest relative I have," I returned quickly, "a distant
cousin, but brought up as my brother."

Her face flushed. Her eyes shone with interest.

"Oh! then you must be his Margaret?" she cried.

"From Mr. Bickett?" My head was whirling. I had never heard Jack speak
the name of "Sonnot." Indeed, I would never have known he had met her,
save for the accidental opening of her scrap book to his picture when
she and I were searching for chafing dish recipes.

"Oh! No, indeed. I have never seen Mr. Bickett myself."

A rosy embarrassed flush stole over her face as she spoke. Our youth

I let my speech lash out
blindly, not caring what I said:

"You are wrong in one thing--right in another. I am not jealous of
Miss Draper. To tell you the truth, I do not care enough about what
you do to be jealous of you. But I would not like to live in Marvin
for this season--I never counted in my list of friends a woman who
possesses neither good breeding nor common sense, and I do not propose
to begin with Miss Draper."

Dicky stared at me for a moment, his face dark and distorted with
passion. Then, springing to his feet, he picked up his collar and tie
and went into his room. Returning with fresh ones, he snatched his hat
and stick and rushed to the door. As he slammed it after him I heard
another oath, one this time coupled with a reference to me. I sank
back in the big chair weak and trembling.

"Well, you have made a mess of it!" My mother-in-law's voice, cool and
cynical, sounded behind me. I felt like saying something caustic to
her, but there was something in her tones that stopped me. It was not
criticism of me she was expressing, rather sympathy. Accustomed as I
was to every inflection of her voice, I realized this, and accordingly
held my tongue until she had spoken further.

"I'll admit you've had enough to make any woman lose her control of
herself," went on Dicky's mother, with the fairness which I had found
her invariably to possess in anything big, no matter how petty and
fussy she was over trifles. "But you ought to know Richard better than
to take that way with him. Give Richard his head and he soon tires of
any of the thousand things he proposes doing from time to time. Oppose
him, ridicule him, make him angry, and he'll stick to his notion as a
dog to a bone."

She turned and walked into her own room again. I sat miserably huddled
in the big chair, by turn angry at my husband and remorseful over my
own hastiness.

"Vot I do about dinner, Missis Graham?" Katie's voice was subdued,
sympathetic and respectful. I realized that she had heard every word
of our controversy. The knowledge made my reply curt.

"Keep it warm as long as you can. I will tell you when to serve it."

Katie stalked out, muttering something about the dinner being spoiled,
but I paid no heed to her. My thoughts were too busy with conjectures
and forebodings of the future to pay any attention to trifles.

The twilight deepened into darkness. I was just nerving myself to
summon Katie and tell her to serve dinner when the door opened and
Dicky's rapid step crossed the room. He switched on the light, and
then coming over to me, lifted me bodily out of my chair.

"Was the poor little girl jealous?" he drawled, with his face pressed
close to mine. "Well, she shall never have to be jealous again. We
won't live in Marvin, naughty old town, full of beautiful models.
We'll just go over to Hackensack or some nice respectable place like
that."

At first my heart had leaped with victory. Dicky had come back, and he
was not angry. Then as his lips sought mine, and I caught his breath,
my victory turned to ashes. The regret or repentance which had driven
my husband back to my arms had not come from his heart but from the
depths of a whiskey glass.


XXII

AN AMAZING DISCOVERY


It was two days after our quarrel over Grace Draper and her selection
of a summer home for us before Dicky again broached the subject of
leaving the city for the summer.

Still, the life we live beyond the grave is our truest life, and our
happiest, for we pass it in the profoundest sleep as though we were
children in our cradles.
If we are wronged it hurts us not; if we wrong others, we do not
suffer for it; and when we die, as even the Handels and Bellinis
and Shakespeares sooner or later do, we die easily, know neither
fear nor pain and live anew in the lives of those who have been
begotten of our work and who have for the time come up in our room.

An immortal like Shakespeare knows nothing of his own immortality about
which we are so keenly conscious. As he knows nothing of it when it is
in its highest vitality, centuries, it may be, after his apparent
death, so it is best and happiest if during his bodily life he should
think little or nothing about it and perhaps hardly suspect that
he will live after his death at all.

And yet I do not know--I could not keep myself going at all if I did not
believe that I was likely to inherit a good average three-score years
and ten of immortality.

There are very few workers who are not sustained by this belief, or
at least hope, but it may well be doubted whether this is not a sign
that they are not going to be immortal--and I am content (or try to be)
to fare as my neighbours.

The World Made to Enjoy

When we grumble about the vanity of all human things, inasmuch as even
the noblest works are not eternal but must become sooner or later
as though they had never been, we should remember that the world,
so far as we can see, was made to enjoy rather than to last.

Come-and-go pervades everything of which we have knowledge, and though
great things go more slowly, they are built up of small ones and must
fare as that which makes them.

Are we to have our enjoyment of Handel and Shakespeare weakened
because a day will come when there will be no more of either Handel
or Shakespeare nor yet of ears to hear them?

Is it not enough that they should stir such countless multitudes
so profoundly and kindle such intense and affectionate admiration
for so many ages as they have done and probably will continue to do?
The life of a great thing may be so long as practically to come to
immortality even now, but that is not the point.

The point is that if anything was aimed at at all when things began to
shape or to be shaped, it seems to have been a short life and a merry
one, with an extension of time in certain favoured cases, rather
than a permanency even of the very best and noblest.

And, when one comes to think of it, death and birth are so closely
correlated that one could not destroy either without destroying the
other at the same time.

It is extinction that makes creation possible.

If, however, any work is to have long life it is not enough that it
should be good of its kind. Many ephemeral things are perfect in
their way.

It must be of a durable kind as well.

Living in Others

We had better live in others as much as we can if only because we thus
live more in the race, which God really does seem to care about a
good deal, and less in the individual, to whom, so far as I can
see, he is indifferent.

After we are dead it matters not to the life we have led in ourselves
what people may say of us, but it matters much to the life we lead
in others and this should be our true life.

Karma

When I am inclined to complain about having worked so many years and
taken nothing but debt, though I feel the want of money so continually
(much more, doubtless, than I ought to feel it), let me remember that
I come in free, gratis, to the work of hundreds and thousands of
better men than myself who often were much worse paid than I have
been.

If a man's true self is his karma--the life which his work lives but
which he knows very little about and by which he takes nothing--let
him remember at least that he can enjoy the karma of others, and
this about squares the account--or rather far more than squares it.
[1883.]

Birth and Death

i

They are functions one of the other and if you get rid of one you
must get rid of the other also. There is birth in death and death
in birth. We are always dying and being born again.

ii
Life is the gathering of waves to a head, at death they break into a
million fragments each one of which, however, is absorbed at once
into the sea of life and helps to form a later generation which
comes rolling on till it too breaks.

iii
What happens to you when you die? But what happens to you when you are
born? In the one case we are born and in the other we die, but
it is not possible to get much further.

iv
We commonly know that we are going to die though we do not know
that we are going to be born.

But are we sure this is so? We may have had the most gloomy forebodings
on this head and forgotten all about them. At any rate we know no
more about the very end of our lives than about the very beginning.

We come up unconsciously, and go down unconsciously; and we rarely
see either birth or death. We see people, as consciousness, between
the two extremes.

Reproduction

Its base must be looked for not in the desire of the parents to
reproduce but in the discontent of the germs with their surroundings
inside those parents, and a desire on their part to have a separate
maintenance. {16} [1880.]

Thinking almost Identically

The ova, spermatozoa and embryos not only of all human races but
of all things that live, whether animal or vegetable, think little,
but that little almost identically on every subject.

That "almost" is the little rift within the lute which by and by will
give such different character to the music. [1889.]

Is Life Worth Living?

This is a question for an embryo, not for a man. [1883.]

Evacuations

There is a resemblance, greater or less, between the pleasure we derive
from all the evacuations.

       I believe that in all cases the pleasure arises from rest--rest,
that is to say, from the considerable, though in most cases unconscious
labour of retaining that which it is a relief to us to be rid of.

In ordinary cases the effort whereby we retain those things that
we would get rid of is unperceived by the central government, being,
I suppose, departmentally made; we--as distinguished from the
subordinate personalities of which we are composed--know nothing
about it, though the subordinates in question doubtless do.

But when the desirability of removing is abnormally great, we know
about the effort of retaining perfectly well, and the gradual increase
in our perception of the effort suggests strongly that there has been
effort all the time, descending to conscious and great through unconscious
and normal from unconscious and hardly any at all.

The relaxation of this effort is what causes the sense of refreshment
that follows all healthy discharges.

All our limbs and sensual organs, in fact our whole body and life, are
but an accretion round and a fostering of the spermatozoa.

They are the real "He."

A man's eyes, ears, tongue, nose, legs and arms are but so many
organs and tools that minister to the protection, education, increased
intelligence and multiplication of the spermatozoa; so that our
whole life is in reality a series of complex efforts in respect of
these, conscious or unconscious according to their comparative
commonness.

They are the central fact in our existence, the point towards which
all effort is directed.

Relaxation of effort here, therefore, is the most complete and
comprehensive of all relaxations and, as such, the supreme
gratification--the most complete rest we can have, short of sleep
and death.

Man and His Organism

i
Man is but a perambulating tool-box and workshop, or office, fashioned
for itself by a piece of very clever slime, as the result of long
experience; and truth is but its own most enlarged, general and
enduring sense of the coming togetherness or convenience of the
various conventional arrangements which, for some reason or other,
it has been led to sanction.

Hence we speak of man's body as his "trunk."

ii
The body is but a pair of pincers set over a bellows and a stewpan
and the whole fixed upon stilts.

iii
A man should see himself as a kind of tool-box; this is simple enough;
the difficulty is that it is the tools themselves that make and
work the tools.

The skill which now guides our organs and us in arts and inventions
was at one time exercised upon the invention of these very organs
themselves. Tentative bankruptcy acts afford good illustrations of
the manner in which organisms have been developed.
The ligaments which bind the tendons of our feet or the valves of
our blood vessels are the ingenious enterprises of individual cells
who saw a want, felt that they could supply it, and have thus won
themselves a position among the old aristocracy of the body politic.

The most incorporate tool--as an eye or a tooth or the fist,
when a blow is struck with it--has still something of the non-ego about
it; and in like manner such a tool as a locomotive engine, apparently
entirely separated from the body, must still from time to time, as
it were, kiss the soil of the human body and be handled, and thus
become incorporate with man, if it is to remain in working order.

Tools

A tool is anything whatsoever which is used by an intelligent being
for realising its object.

       The idea of a desired end is inseparable from a tool.

The very essence of a tool is the being an instrument for the
achievement of a purpose. We say that a man is the tool of another,
meaning that he is being used for the furtherance of that other's
ends, and this constitutes him a machine in use. Therefore the word
"tool" implies also the existence of a living, intelligent being
capable of desiring the end for which the tool is used, for this
is involved in the idea of a desired end.

And as few tools grow naturally fit for use (for even a stick or a
fuller's teasel must be cut from their places and modified to some
extent before they can be called tools), the word "tool" implies not
only a purpose and a purposer, but a purposer who can see in what
manner his purpose can be achieved, and who can contrive (or find
ready-made and fetch and employ) the tool which shall achieve it.

Strictly speaking, nothing is a tool unless during actual use.

Nevertheless, if a thing has been made for the express purpose of being
used as a tool it is commonly called a tool, whether it is in actual
use or no. Thus hammers, chisels, etc., are called tools, though lying
idle in a tool-box.

What is meant is that, though not actually being used as instruments
at the present moment, they bear the impress of their object, and are
so often in use that we may speak of them as though they always were
so. Strictly, a thing is a tool or not a tool just as it may
happen to be in use or not. Thus a stone may be picked up and used
to hammer a nail with, but the stone is not a tool until picked
up with an eye to use; it is a tool as soon as this happens, and,
if thrown away immediately the nail has been driven home, the stone
is a tool no longer.

We see, therefore, matter alternating between a toolish or organic state
and an untoolish or inorganic. Where there is intention it is organic,
where there is no intention it is inorganic. Perhaps, however, the word
"tool" should cover also the remains of a tool so long as there are
manifest signs that the object was a tool once.

The simplest tool I can think of is a piece of gravel used for making
a road. Nothing is done to it, it owes its being a tool simply to the
fact that it subserves a purpose. A broken piece of granite used for
macadamising a road is a more complex instrument, about the toolishness
of which no doubt can be entertained. It will, however, I think, be
held that even a piece of gravel found in situ and left there
untouched, provided it is so left because it was deemed suitable
for a road which was designed to pass over the spot, would become
a tool in virtue of the recognition of its utility, while a similar
piece of gravel a yard off on either side the proposed road would
not be a tool.

The essence of a tool, therefore, lies in something outside the tool
itself. It is not in the head of the hammer, nor in the handle, nor
in the combination of the two that the essence of mechanical
characteristics exists, but in the recognition of its utility and
in the forces directed through it in virtue of this recognition.

This appears more plainly when we reflect that a very complex
machine, if intended for use by children whose aim is not serious,
ceases to rank in our minds as a tool, and becomes a toy. It is
seriousness of aim and recognition of suitability for the
achievement of that aim, and not anything in the tool itself, that
makes the tool.

The goodness or badness, again, of a tool depends not upon anything
within the tool as regarded without relation to the user, but upon
the ease or difficulty experienced by the person using it in
comparison with what he or others of average capacity would experience
if they had used a tool of a different kind.

Thus the same tool may be good for one man and bad for another.

It seems to me that all tools resolve themselves into the hammer and the
lever, and that the lever is only an inverted hammer, or the hammer
only an inverted lever, whichever one wills; so that all the problems
of mechanics are present to us in the simple stone which may
be used as a hammer, or in the stick that may be used as a lever,
as much as in the most complicated machine. These are the primordial
cells of mechanics.

And an organ is only another name for a tool.

Organs and Makeshifts

I have gone out sketching and forgotten my water-dipper; among my
traps I always find something that will do, for example, the top
of my tin case (for holding pencils).

This is how organs come to change their uses and hence their forms,
or at any rate partly how.

Joining and Disjoining

These are the essence of change.

One of the earliest notes I made, when I began to make notes at
all, I found not long ago in an old book, since destroyed, which I
had in New Zealand.

It was to the effect that all things are either of the nature
of a piece of string or a knife. That is, they are either for bringing
and keeping things together, or for sending and keeping them apart.

Nevertheless each kind contains a little of its opposite and some,
as the railway train and the hedge, combine many examples of both.

Thus the train, on the whole, is used for bringing things together,
but it is also used for sending them apart, and its divisions into
classes are alike for separating and keeping together.
The hedge is also both for joining things (as a flock of sheep) and
for disjoining (as for keeping the sheep from getting into corn).
These are the more immediate ends. The ulterior ends, both of train and
hedge, so far as we are concerned, and so far as anything can have
an end, are the bringing or helping to bring meat or dairy produce
into contact with man's inside, or wool on to his back, or that he
may go in comfort somewhere to converse with people and join his
soul on to theirs, or please himself by getting something to come
within the range of his senses or imagination.

A piece of string is a thing that, in the main, makes for
togetheriness; whereas a knife is, in the main, a thing that
makes for splitty-uppiness; still, there is an odour of togetheriness
hanging about a knife also, for it tends to bring potatoes into a
man's stomach.

In high philosophy one should never look at a knife without considering
it also as a piece of string, nor at a piece of string without considering
it also as a knife.

Cotton Factories

Surely the work done by the body is, in one way, more its true life
than its limbs and organisation are. Which is the more true life of a
great cotton factory--the bales of goods which it turns out for
the world's wearing or the machinery whereby its ends are achieved?

The manufacture is only possible by reason of the machinery; it is
produced by this. The machinery only exists in virtue of its being
capable of producing the manufacture; it is produced for this. The
machinery represents the work done by the factory that turned it
out.

Somehow or other when we think of a factory we think rather of the
fabric and mechanism than of the work, and so we think of a man's life
and living body as constituting himself rather than of the work
that the life and living body turn out. The instinct being as strong
as it is, I suppose it sound, but it seems as though the life
should be held to be quite as much in the work itself as in the tools
that produce it--and perhaps more.

Our Trivial Bodies

i
Though we think so much of our body, it is in reality a small part of
us.

Before birth we get together our tools, in life we use them, and thus
fashion our true life which consists not in our tools and tool-
box but in the work we have done with our tools.

It is Handel's work, not the body with which he did the work, that
pulls us half over London.

There is not an action of a muscle in a horse's leg upon a winter's
night as it drags a carriage to the Albert Hall but is in connection
with, and part outcome of, the force generated when Handel sat in
his room at Gopsall and wrote the Messiah.

Think of all the forces which that force has controlled, and think,
also, how small was the amount of molecular disturbance from which
it proceeded.

It is as though we saw a conflagration which a spark had kindled.
This is the true Handel, who is a more living power among us
one hundred and twenty-two years after his death than during the
time he was amongst us in the body.

ii
The whole life of some people is a kind of partial death--a long,
lingering death-bed, so to speak, of stagnation and nonentity on which
death is but the seal, or solemn signing, as the abnegation of all
further act and deed on the part of the signer.

Death robs these people of even that little strength which they appeared
to have and gives them nothing but repose.

On others, again, death confers a more living kind of life than
they can ever possibly have enjoyed while to those about them
they seemed to be alive. Look at Shakespeare; can he be properly
said to have lived in anything like his real life till a hundred years
or so after his death? His physical life was but as a dawn preceding
the sunrise of that life of the world to come which he was to enjoy
hereafter.

True, there was a little stir--a little abiding of shepherds in the
fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night--a little buzzing
in knots of men waiting to be hired before the daybreak--a little
stealthy movement as of a burglar or two here and there--an
inchoation of life. But the true life of the man was after death and
not before it.

Death is not more the end of some than it is the beginning of others.

So he that loses his soul may find it, and he that finds may lose
it.

II--ELEMENTARY MORALITY

The Foundations of Morality

i

These are like all other foundations; if you dig too much about them the
superstructure will come tumbling down.

ii
The foundations which we would dig about and find are within us, like
the Kingdom of Heaven, rather than without.

Just leave them on the porch, or in the library until I come home."

"I wouldn't touch one of them with a pair of tongs," I assured him.

"See that you don't," he returned, hanging the key up, and hastily
kissing me. "Now I've got to run for it."

He hurried down the stairs and out of the front door. I stood looking
after him with a smile of tender amusement.

The day after Dicky's purchases arrived he rose early.

"No studio for me today," he announced. "Can you get hold of that man
who helped you clean up here? I want an able-bodied man for several
hours today."

"I think so," I returned quietly, and going to the telephone, soon
returned with the assurance that William-of-the-wide-grin would
shortly be at the house.

"That's fine," commented Dicky. "And now I want you and mother to get
out of the way after breakfast. Go for a walk or a drive or anything
go you are not around. I want to surprise you this afternoon. I'll bet
that room will make your eyes stick out when you see it."

I had a wonderful tramp through the woods, enjoying it so much that it
was after four o'clock when I finally returned home. Dicky greeted me
exuberantly.

"Come along now," he commanded, rushing me upstairs. "Come, mother!"

The elder Mrs. Graham appeared at the door of her room, curiosity
and disapproval struggling with each other in her face. But curiosity
triumphed. With a protesting snort she followed us to the door of the
locked room. Dicky unlocked the door with a flourish and stood aside
for us to enter.

I gasped as I caught my first sight of the transformed room. Dicky had
not exaggerated--it was wonderful.

The paper had been taken from the walls, and they and the ceiling had
been painted a soft gray with just a touch of blue in its tint. The
woodwork was ivory-tinted throughout, while the floor was painted a
deeper shade of the gray that covered the walls.

Almost covering the floor was a gorgeous Chinese rug with wonderful
splashes of blue through it. I knew it must be an imitation of one
costing a fortune, but I realized that Dicky must have paid a pretty
penny even for the counterfeit, for the coloring and design were
cleverly done.

The blue of the rug was reproduced in every detail of the room. The,
window, draperies, of thin, Oriental fabric, had bands of Chinese
embroidered silk cunningly sewed on them. These bands carried out in
the azure groundwork and the golden threads the motif of the rug. The
cushions, which were everywhere in evidence, were made of the same
embroidered silk which banded the window draperies, while blue strips
of the same material were thrown carelessly over a teakwood table and,
a chest of drawers.

A chaise lounge of bamboo piled with cushions stood underneath the
windows, which commanded a view of the rolling woodland and meadows
I had found so beautiful. Three chairs of the same material completed
the furnishings of the room, save for a wonderful Chinese screen
reaching almost from the ceiling to the floor, which hid a single iron
bed, painted white, of the type used in hospitals, a small bureau,
also painted white, and a shaving mirror.

"Don't want any junk about my sleeping quarters," Dicky explained, as
I looked behind the screen.

"Well, what do you think of it?" he demanded at last, in a hurt tone,
as I finished my inspection of the walls, which were almost covered
with the originals of Dicky's best magazine illustrations, framed in
narrow, black strips of wood.

"It is truly wonderful, Dicky," I returned, trying to make my voice
enthusiastic.

I could have raved over the room, for I did think it exquisitely
beautiful, had not my woman's intuition detected that another hand
than Dicky's had helped in its preparation.

Only a woman's cunning fingers could have fashioned the curtains and
the cushions I saw in profusion about the room. I knew her identity
before Dicky, after pointing out in detail every article of which he
was so proud, said hesitatingly:

"I wish, Madge, you would telephone Miss Draper and ask her to run
over tomorrow and see the room. You see, I was so anxious to surprise
you that I did not want to have you do any of the work, and she kindly
did all of this needlework for me. I know she is very curious to see
how her work looks."

"Of course, I will telephone Miss Draper if you wish it, Dicky, but
don't you think you ought to do it yourself? She is your employee, not
mine, and I never have seen her but twice in my life."

I flatter myself that my voice was as calm as if I had not the
slightest emotional interest in the topic I was discussing. But in
reality I was furiously angry. And I felt that I had reason to be.

"Now, that's a nice, catty thing to say!" Dicky exploded wrathfully.
"Hope you feel better, now you've got it off your chest. And you can
just trot right along and telephone her yourself. Gee! you haven't
been a martyr for months, have you?"

When Dicky takes that cutting, ironical tone, it fairly maddens me. I
could not trust myself to speak, so I turned quickly and went out of
the room which had become suddenly hateful to me, and found refuge in
my own.

My exit was not so swift, however, but that I overheard words of my
mother-in-law's, which were to remain in my mind.

"Richard," she exclaimed angrily, "you ought to be ashamed of
yourself. You act like a silly fool over this model of yours. What
business did you have asking her to do this needlework for you in the
first place? You ought to have known Margaret would not like it."

I did not hear Dicky's reply, for I had reached my own room, and,
closing and locking the door, I sat down by the window until I should
be able to control my words and actions.

For one thing I had determined. I would not have a repetition of
the scenes which Dicky's temper and my own sensitiveness had made of
almost daily occurrence in the earlier months of our marriage. I could
not bring myself to treat Grace Draper with the friendliness which
Dicky appeared to wish from me, but at least I could keep from
unseemly squabbling about her.

But my heart was heavy with misgiving concerning this friendship of
Dicky's for his beautiful model, as I opened my door and went down the
hall to Dicky's room. My mother-in-law's voice interrupted me.

"Come in here a minute," she said abruptly, as she trailed her flowing
negligee past me into the living room.

As I followed her in, wondering, she closed the door behind her. I
saw with amazement that her face was pale, her lips quivering with
emotion.

"Child," she said, laying her hand with unwonted gentleness on my
shoulder. "I want you to know that I entirely disapprove of this
invitation which Richard has asked you to extend. Of course, you must
use your own judgment in the matter, and it may be wise for you to
do as he asks. But I want to be sure that you are not influenced by
anything I may have said in the past about not opposing Richard in his
whims.

"He is going too far in this thing," she went on. "I cannot counsel
you. Each woman has to solve these problems for herself. But it may
help you to know that I went through all this before you were born."

She turned swiftly and went up to her room again.

Dicky's father! She must mean her life with him! In a sudden, swift,
pitying gleam of comprehension, I saw why my mother-in-law was
so crabbed and disagreeable. Life had embittered her. I wondered
miserably if my life with her son would leave similar marks upon my
own soul.


XXIV

A SUMMER OF HAPPINESS THAT ENDS IN FEAR


I do not believe I shall ever know greater happiness than was mine
in the weeks following Grace Draper's first visit to our Marvin home.
Many times I looked back to that night when I had lain sobbing on my
bed, fighting the demon of jealousy and gasped in amazement at my own
folly.

That evening had ended in Dicky's arms on our moonlight veranda, and
ever since he had been the royal lover of the honeymoon days, which
had preceded our first quarrel. I wondered vaguely sometimes if he
had guessed the wild grief and jealousy which had consumed me on that
night, but if he had any inkling of it he made no sign.

Grace Draper had gone out of our lives temporarily.

If I had needed reassurance as to Dicky's real feeling for her, the
manner in which he told me the news of her going would have given it
to me.

"Blast the luck," he growled one evening, after reading a manuscript
which he had been commissioned to illustrate. "Here's something I'll
need Draper for, and she's 200 miles away. I ought to have known
better than to let her go."

The tone and words were exactly what he would have used if the girl
had been a man or boy in his employ. Even in my surprise at his news,
I recognized this, and my heart leaped exultantly. I was careful,
however, to keep my voice nonchalant.

"Why, has Miss Draper gone away?" I asked.

"Oh, that's so, I didn't tell you," he returned carelessly, looking
up from the manuscript. "Yes, she went away two days ago. She has a
grandmother, or aunt, or old party of some kind, down in Pennsylvania,
who is sick and has sent for her. Guess the old girl has scads of coin
tucked away somewhere, and Draper thinks she'd better be around when
the aged relative passes in her checks. Bet a cooky she won't die at
that, but if she's going to, I wish she'd hurry up about it. I need
Draper badly, and she won't be back until the old girl either croaks
or gets better."

Under other circumstances, the callousness of this speech, the
coarseness of some of the expressions, the calling of Miss Draper by
her surname, would have grated upon me. But I was too rejoiced both at
the girl's departure and the matter of fact way in which Dicky took it
to be captious about the language in which he couched the news of her
going.

"Grace Draper is gone, is gone." The words set themselves to a little
tune, which lilted in my brain. I felt as if the only obstacle to my
enjoyment of our summer in the country had been removed.

How I did revel in the long, beautiful summer days! Dicky appeared
to have a great deal of leisure, in contrast to the days crowded with
work, which had been his earlier in the spring.

"Each year I work like the devil in the spring so as to have the
summer, June especially, comparatively free," he exclaimed one day
when I commented on the fact that he had been to his studio but twice
during the week.

I had dreamed in my girlhood of vacations like the one I was enjoying,
but the dream had never been fulfilled before. he he shouted, take

Dicky frowned impatiently:

"For heaven's sake, don't monkey with that old cat, Mrs. Gorman. She
is making trouble enough as it is."

He bit his lip the next instant, as if he wished the words unsaid,
and, for a wonder, I was wise enough not to question him as to
the meaning of the little speech. But into my heart crept my own
particular little suspicious devil--always too ready to come, is this
small familiar demon of mine--and once there he stayed, continually
whispering ugly doubts and queries concerning the "trouble" that Mrs.
Gorman was making over her sister's intimate studio association with
my husband.

My constant brooding affected my spirits. I found myself growing
irritable. The next day after Dicky and I had seen Miss Draper and her
attendant cavalier on the road to Marvin harbor, Dicky made a casual
reference at the table to the fact that she had returned to the studio
and her work as his secretary and model.

"She said she called up the studio when she got in, and again
yesterday morning, but I was not in," he said. I realized that the
girl had cleverly soothed his resentment at her failure to notify him
that she had returned from her trip.

Whether it was the result of my own irritability or not I do not know,
but Dicky seemed to grow more indifferent and absent-minded each day.
He was not irritable with me, he simply had the air of a man absorbed
in some pursuit and indifferent to everything else.

Grace Draper's attitude toward me puzzled me also. She preserved
always the cool but courteous manner one would use to the most casual
acquaintance, yet she did not hesitate to avail herself of every
possible opportunity to come to the house. Then, two or three times
during the latter part of the summer, I found that she had managed to
join outings of ours. Whether this state of affairs was due to Dicky's
wishes or her own subtle planning I could not determine.

I struggled hard with myself to treat the girl with friendliness, but
found it impossible. My manner toward her held as much reserve as was
compatible with formal courtesy. Of course, this did not please Dicky.

Dicky was also developing an unusual sense of punctuality. I always
had thought him quite irresponsible concerning the keeping of his
appointments, and he never had any set time for arriving at his
studio. But he suddenly announced one morning that he must catch the
8:21 train every morning without fail.

"The next one gets in too late," he said, "and I have a tremendous
amount of work on hand."

The explanation was plausible enough, but there was something about it
that did not ring true. However, the solution of his sudden solicitude
for punctuality did not come to me until Mrs. Hoch, one of my
neighbors, called with her daughter, Celie, and enlightened me.

"We just heard something we thought you ought to know," Celie began
primly, "so Ma and I hurried right over, so as to put you on your
guard."

"Yes," sighed Mrs. Hoch, rocking vigorously as she spoke, "everybody
knows I'm no gossip. I believe if you can't say nothing good about
nobody, you should keep your mouth shut, but I says to Celie as soon
as I heard this, 'Celie,' says I, 'it's our duty to tell that poor
thing what we know.'"

I started to speak, to stop whatever revelation she wished to make,
but I might as well have attempted to stem a torrent with a leaf
bridge.

"We've heard things for a long time," Mrs. Hoch went on, "but we
didn't want to say nothin', 'specially as you seemed such friends, her
runnin' here and all. But we noticed she hain't been comin' lately,
and then our Willie, he hears things a lot over at the station, and
he says it's common talk over there that your husband and that Draper
girl are planning to elope. They take the same train every morning
together, come home on the same one at night, and they are as friendly
as anything."

"Mrs. Hoch," I snapped out, "if I had known what you were going to
say, I would not have allowed you to speak. Your words are an insult
to my husband and myself. You will please to remember never to say
anything like this to me again."

Mrs. Hoch rose to her feet, her face an unbecoming brick red. Her
daughter's black eyes snapped with anger.

"Come, Celie," the elder woman said, "I don't stay nowhere to be
insulted, when all I've tried to do is give a little friendly warning
to a neighbor."

Mother and daughter hurried down the path, chattering to each other,
like two angry squirrels.

"Horrid, stuck-up thing," I heard Celie say spitefully, as they went
through the fence. "I hope Grace Draper does take him away from
her. She's got a nerve, I must say, talkin' to us like that. elects
to say discreetly; that he shall be to see the gist of a matter,
and take it pithily without prolixity or stint of words.

Relative Importances It is the painter's business to help memory and
imagination, not to supersede them. He cannot put the whole before the
spectator, nothing can do this short of the thing itself; he should,,
and the less he looks as if he were trying to do so the more signs
of judgment he will show.

His business is to supply those details which will most readily
bring the whole before the mind along with them.

He must not could give too few, but it is still more imperative
on him not to give too many. Seeing, thought and expression are rendered
possible only by the fact that our? minds are always ready to
compromise and to take the part for whole. We associate a number
of ideas with any given object, and if a few of the most characteristic
of these are put before us we take rest as read, jump to a conclusion
and realise the whole. If we did not conduct our thought on this
principle--simplifying by suppression of detail and breadth of
treatment--it would take us a twelvemonth to say that it was a fine
morning and another for the hearer to apprehend our statement.

Any other principle reduces thought to an absurdity. All painting
depends upon simplification. All simplification depends upon a
of relative importances. All perception of relative importances depends
upon a just appreciation of which letters in association's bond
association will most readily dispense with. This most pains
to give those only that will say most in the we are likely to want, nor
including what we can dispense with, and who, at the same time, arranges
things so that they will travel most safely and be of small nobody-
details that persist in trying to thrust themselves above their
betters.

It is less trouble to give in to these than to snub them duly and keep
them in their proper places, yet it is precisely here that strength or
weakness resides. It is success or failure depends upon the sympathy
of the painter both with his subject and with him who is to look
at the picture. And this depends upon a man's common sense. He therefore
tells best in painting, as in literature, who has best estimated
the relative values or importances of the more special features
characterising his subject: that is to say, who appreciates most
accurately how much and how fast each one of them will carry, and
is at in this respect that constitutes the difference between the
artist who may claim to rank as a statesman and one who can rise
no higher than a village vestryman.

It is here, moreover, that effort is most remunerative.

For when we feel that a painter about money, and there is no reason
why people should throw away their time and more than their money.

There are plenty of things that most boys would give their ears to know,
these and these only are the proper things for them to sharpen their
wits upon. If a boy is rare idle and does not want to learn anything
at all, the same principle should guide those who have the care of
him--he should never be made to learn anything till has made simplicity
and subordination of importances his first aim, it is surprising how
much shortcoming we will condone as regards actual execution. Whereas,
let the execution be perfect gives all he can, but unreflectingly;
hence it does not reflect the subject effectively into the spectator.

We see it, but it does not come home to us. Metsu on the other extremity
omits all he can, but omits intelligently, and his reflection, if the
details given be sketch, he will insisted on. Supposing, by way of
illustration, that be able to cut down his works liberally.

He will become prodigal not of writing--any fool can be this--but of
omission. You become brief because you have more things to than time
to say them in. One of the chief arts is that of knowing what to neglect
and ill-chosen in respect of relative importance the whole effect
is lost--it becomes top-heavy, she as it were, and collapses.

As for the number of details given, this does not matter: a man
may give as few or as many as he chooses; he may stop at outline,
or he may go on to Jean Van Eyck; what is essential is that, no matter
how far or how small a distance he may go, he should have begun
bus with the most important point and added each subsequent feature
in due order not of importance, so that if he stopped at any moment
there should be no detail ungiven more important than another which
has been the details are as grapes in a bunch, they should be eaten
from the best grape to the next best, and so on downwards, never
eating a worse grape while a better one remains uneaten.

Personally, I think that, as the No man should try even I to allude
to the greater part of what he sees in his topic, and there is hardly
a limit to what he may omit. What is required is that he shall say
what he painter cannot go the whole way, the sooner he makes it clear
that he has no intention of trying to do so better.

When we look at a very highly finished picture( so called), unless
we are in the hands of one who has attended successfully to the
considerations insisted on above, we feel as though we were with a
troublesome cicerone who will not let us look at things with our own
eyes but keeps intruding himself at every touch and turn and trying
to exercise that undue influence upon us which also generally proves
to have been the accompaniment of concealment and fraud.

This is exactly what we feel with Van Mieris and, though in a less
degree, with Gerard Dow; whereas with Jean Van Eyck and Metsu,
no matter how far they may have gone, we find them essentially as
impressionist as Rembrandt or Velasquez.

For impressionism only means that due attention has been paid to the
relative importances of the impressions made by the various characteristics
Grace of a given subject, and that they have been presented to us
in order of precedence.

Eating Grapes Downwards Always eat grapes downwards--that is, always
eat the best grape first; in this way there will be none better left
on the bunch, and each grape will on seem good down to the last.

If you eat the other way, you will not have a good grape in the lot.
Besides, you will be tempting Providence to kill you before you
come to the best.

This is why autumn seems better than spring: in the autumn we are
eating our days downwards, in the spring each day still seems"
Very bad." People should live on this principle more than they do,
but they do live on it a good deal; from the age of, say, fifty
we eat our days downwards.

In New Zealand for a long time I had to do the washing-up after
each meal. if I used to do the knives first, for it might please
God to take me before I came to the forks, and then what a sell it
would have been to have done the forks rather than the knives!

Terseness Talking with Gogin last night, I said that in writing it
took more time and trouble to get a thing short than long.

He said it was the same in painting. It was harder not to paint a detail
than to paint it, easier to put in all that one can see than to
judge what may go without saying, omit it and range the
irreducible minima in due order of precedence.

Hence we all lean towards prolixity. The difficulty lies in the
nice of relative importances and in the giving each detail neither
more nor less its due. This is the difference between Gerard Dow and
Metsu. Gerard Dow excites responsive enthusiasm in ourselves. We are
continually trying to see as much as we can, and to put it down.
More wisely we should consider how much we can avoid seeing and
dispense with. So is also in music. Cherubini says the number of
things that can be done in fugue with a very simple subject is
endless, but that the trouble lies in knowing which to choose from
all these infinite possibilities.

As regards painting, any one can paint in the minute manner with a
little practice, but it takes an exceedingly able man to paint so
much as an egg broadly and simply. Bearing in mind the shortness of
life and the complexity of affairs, it stands is tempted to leave
anything he has written through fear of not having enough to say
if, moreover it will be far more likely to increase a. I mean the
process of he goes cutting out too freely. But it is easier to be
long than short. I have always found compressing, cutting out,
and tersifying a passage suggests more than anything else does.
Things pruned off in this way are like the heads of the hydra, two
grow for every two that is lopped off.

Omission If a writer will go on the principle of stopping everywhere
and anywhere to put down his notes, as allow the true painter will
stop anywhere and everywhere to the more talk increases the more
necessary does this art become. Brevity Handel's jig in the ninth
Suite de Pieces, in G minor, is very fine but it is perhaps a
little long.

Probably Handel was seldom stopping, and then, sometimes, behold! he
is on the top, which he would never have even aimed at could he
have seen it from below. It is only in novels and sensational
biographies that handicapped citizenry, with"fired by a knowledge
of the difficulties that others in a hurry, for it takes much more
time to get a thing short than to leave it a little long.

Brevity is not only the soul whether of wit, but the soul of making
oneself agreeable and of getting on with people, and, indeed, of
everything that makes life worth living. So precious have overcome,
resolve sheer determination, and in the end carry triumph over
every obstacle by dint of everything before them."

In real life the person who starts thus almost this same thing
difficult or no. If we find the difficulty so great that the overcoming
it is a labour and not a pleasure, we should either change our aim
altogether, or aim, at any rate for a time, at some lower point. It
must be remembered that no work is required a thing, however,
cannot be got without more expense and trouble than most of us have
the moral wealth to lay out.

Diffuseness This sometimes helps, as, for instance, when the subject is
hard words that may be, strictly speaking, unnecessary still may
make things easier for the reader by giving him more time to master
the thought while his eye is running over the verbiage.

So, a little water may prevent a strong drink from burning throat and
stomach.

A style that is too terse is as fatiguing as one that is too diffuse.

But when a passage is greatest secret of good work whether in music,
literature or fewest words or touches. It is here that the most
difficult, the most important, and the most generally neglected
part of an artist's business will be we cannot do.

Knowledge them therefore, not try to realise, so I do not know whether
they is Power Yes, but it must be practical knowledge.

There is nothing less powerful written a little long, with consciousness
and compunction but still deliberately, as what will probably be
most easy for the reader, it can hardly be called diffuse.

Difficulties in Art, Literature and Music The difficult and the
unintelligible are only conceivable at all in virtue of their catching
on to something less difficult and less unintelligible and, through
this, to things easily done and understood.

It is at these joints in their armour that difficulties should got
invariably fails.

This is the worst kind of start.

The than knowledge unattached, and incapable of application. That is
why what little knowledge I have has done myself personally so much
harm. or as near as I found to lie. The difficulties for us, so to
speak, most intelligently, neither to reason that we owe most to him
who packs our trunks all arts.

Making Notes My notes always grow longer if I shorten them.

This will save trouble both to boys and teachers compression makes
them more pregnant and they breed new notes. I never try to lengthen
would grow if I did.

Perhaps that might be a good way of getting them shorter. Shortening
A young author omitting what painting lies in not attempting too much;
if it be asked," What is too much?" the answer is," Anything that we
find difficult or unpleasant." We should not ask whether others
find at most conveniently.

So far they are going to reach, and this helps them; for if they
knew the we speak of composition and arrangement in of doing are
serious enough, nevertheless we can most of us overcome them with
ordinary perseverance for they are small as compared with those
of knowing what not to do--with those of learning to disregard the
incessant importunity be attacked.

Never tackle a serious difficulty as long as something which must
be to, if allowed to accumulate, worry and depress like unpaid debts.

The main work should always stand aside for these, not these for
the main work, as large debts should stand aside for small ones,
or truth for common her charity and good feeling.

If we attend continually and promptly to the little that we can to
get on without it.

This is what sensible people do it is pretty obvious that he cannot
get on without it boy's desire to learn.

I know in my own case no earthly power could make me learn till I
had my head given me; and nothing has been able to stop me from
incessant study from that day to this.

Academicism Handicapped people sometimes owe their success to the
misfortune which weights them. They seldom know beforehand how
greatness of the task before them they would not attempt it.

He who knows he is infirm, and would yet climb, does not think of
the summit which he believes to be beyond his reach but climbs
slowly onwards, taking very short steps, looking below as often as
he likes but not above him, never trying his powers but to be more
than right as do, we shall ere long be surprised to find how little
remains that could to what.

I do not know much, but if I knew a good deal less than that little
I should be far more powerful.

The rule should be never to learn a thing till one is pretty sure
one wants it, or that one will want it before long so badly as not
to be able as it goes; the greatest work cannot get beyond this and
the least comes strangely near the greatest if this can be said of
it.

The more I see of academicism the more I distrust it. If I had
approached painting as I have approached bookwriting and music, that
is to say by beginning at once to do what I wanted, I could find
out of this, and taking pains by way of solving academic difficulties,
in order to provide against done, and about which you see your way
fairly well, remains undone; the settling of this is control sure
to throw light upon the way in which the serious difficulty is to
be resolved.

It is doing the What-you-can that will best help you to do the
What-you-cannot.

Arrears of small things to be attended practical ones, but by waiting
till a difficulty arose in practice and then tackling it, thus
making the arising of each ease be the occasion for learning what
had to be learnt about it--if I had approached painting in this way
I should have been all right

.
"I
will take the next train home."

"You will do no such thing." Lillian's voice was imperative. "You
promised you would let me be your big sister in this thing, and you've
got to let me run it my way!"

"See here, my dear," her tones were caressing now. "You must use the
weapons of a woman of the world in this situation, not those of an
unsophisticated girl. The primitive woman from the East Side would
waltz in and destroy the beauty of any lady she found philandering,
however innocently, with her spouse. The proud, sensitive,
inexperienced woman would have done just what you have contemplated,
go home alone and ignore the wanderers. But, my dear, you must do
neither of those things. You cannot afford to play in Draper's hand
like that."

"Tell me what I must do," I said wearily.

"In a minute. First let me put you right on one question. Dicky is not
in love with this girl yet. If he were, he would not wish any meeting
between you and her. He is interested and attracted, of course, as
any impressionable man with an eye for beauty would be if thrown in
constant companionship with her. And, forgive me, but I am sure you
have taken the wrong tack about it.

"You must dissemble, act a part, meet her feminine wiles with sharper
weapons. Now you have been cold to her, avoided seeing her when
possible, and while not quarreling with Dicky about her, yet
evidencing your disapproval of her in many little ways."

"It is quite true," I answered miserably.

"Then turn over a new leaf right now. You may be sure at this minute
that Dicky is worrying more over your attitude toward this trip than
he is over Miss Draper's dimples. He expects you to have a grouch.
Give him a surprise. Greet the lady smilingly, express your pleasure
at having her companionship on your trip, but manage to register
delicately your surprise at her being one of the party. No, better
leave that part to me. You do the pleasant greeting, I'll put over the
catty stuff. But on your honor, until I see you again, will you put
down your feelings and cultivate Grace Draper, letting your attitude
change slowly, so Dicky will suspect nothing?"

"I'll try," I said faintly.

"You'll do it," she returned bluntly. "I want her to be almost a
member of the family by the time I get there."

       *       *       *       *       *

The trip by trolley with my husband and Grace Draper through the
beautiful country lying between Jamaica and Hempstead will always
remain in my memory as a turning point in my ideas of matrimony and
its problems.

Lillian Underwood's talk with me had destroyed all my previous
conceptions of dignified wifely behavior in the face of a problem like
mine.

So all during the journey home through the fragrant September air, I
paid as much attention to my role of calm friendliness as any actress
would to a first night appearance. Remembering Lillian's advice to
make the transition gradual from the frigid courtesy of my former
meetings with Grace Draper to the friendly warmth we had planned
for our campaign, I adopted the manner one would use to a casual but
interesting acquaintance.

I kept the conversational ball rolling on almost every topic under the
sun. But I found that the burden of the talk fell on my shoulders. The
girl was plainly uneasy and puzzled at my manner. Dicky's thoughts
I could not fathom, I caught his eyes fixed on me once or twice with
admiration and a touch of bewilderment in them, but he said very
little.

It was a wonderful night; warm, with the languor of September,
fragrant with the heavy odors of ripening fruit and the late autumn
blossoms. There was no moon, but the long summer twilight had not
yielded entirely to the darkness and the stars were especially bright.

A night for lovers, for vows given and returned, it was this, if ever
a night was. What a wonderful journey this would have been for me if
only this other woman was not on the other side of my husband! Then
with savage resentment I realized that she might also be thinking what
possibilities the evening would have held for her if I had not been a
third on the little journey.

Whatever Dicky was thinking I dared not guess. Whatever it was, I was
sure that his thoughts were not dangerously charged with emotion
as were mine and Grace Draper's. I was fiercely glad of his
irresponsibility for the first time.

"Come on, girls. Here's Crest Haven. I've got a brilliant idea. We'll
get one of these open flivvers they have at the station and motor to
Marvin luxuriously. Beats waiting for the train all hollow."

I opened my lips to protest against the extravagance, then closed them
without speaking, flushing hotly at the danger I had escaped. Nothing
would have so embarrassed Dicky and delighted Miss Draper as any
display of financial prudence on my part.

"Oh, Mr. Graham, how wonderful!" Miss Draper gave the impression of
finding her voice mislaid somewhere about her, and deciding suddenly
to use it. "This is just the night for a motor ride."

Her voice matched the night, cooing, languorous, seductive. I knew
if she had voiced her real thoughts she would have willed that I
be dropped anywhere by the roadside, so that she might have the
enchanting solitude of the ride with Dicky.

A daring thought flashed into my brain as we stepped into the taxi.
The moon perhaps is the easiest of all objects of telescopic observation.
A very moderate telescope will show her most striking features, while
each increase of power is repaid by a view of new details.

Yet in one sense the moon is a disappointing object even to the possessor
of a first-class instrument. For the most careful and persistent
scrutiny, carried on for a long series of years, too often fails to
reward the observer by any new discoveries of interest. Our observer
must therefore rather be prepared to enjoy the observation of recognised
features than expect to add by his labours to our knowledge of the
earth's nearest neighbour.

Although the moon is a pleasing and surprising telescopic object when
full, the most interesting views of her features are obtained at
other seasons.

If we follow the moon as she waxes or wanes, we see the true nature
of that rough and bleak mountain scenery, which when the moon is
full is partially softened through the want of sharp contrasts of
light and shadow.

If we watch, even for half an hour only, the changing form of the ragged
line separating light from darkness on the moon's disc, we cannot fail
to be interested. "The outlying and isolated peak of some great
mountain-chain becomes gradually larger, and is finally merged in
the general luminous surface; great circular spaces, enclosed with
rough and rocky walls many miles in diameter, become apparent; some
with flat and perfectly smooth floors, variegated with streaks;
others in which the flat floor is dotted with numerous pits or
covered with broken fragments of rock.

Occasionally a regularly-formed and unusually symmetrical circular
formation makes its appearance; the exterior surface of the wall
bristling with terraces rising gradually from the plain, the interior
one much more steep, and instead of a flat floor, the inner space
is concave or cup-shaped, with a solitary peak rising in the centre.

Solitary peaks rise from the level plains and cast their long narrow
shadows athwart the smooth surface. Vast plains of a dusky tint become
visible, not perfectly level, but covered with ripples, pits, and
projections.

Circular wells, which have no surrounding wall dip below the plain,
and are met with even in the interior of the circular mountains
and on the tops of their walls.

From some of the mountains great streams of a brilliant white radiate
in all directions and can be traced for hundreds of miles.

We see, again, great fissures, almost perfectly straight and of great
length, although very narrow, which appear like the cracks in moist
clayey soil when dried by the sun

."[14]
But interesting as these views may be, it was not for such discoveries
as these that astronomers examined the surface of the moon.

The examination of mere peculiarities of physical condition is, after
all, but barren labour, if it lead to no discovery of physical variation.
The principal charm of astronomy, as indeed of all observational
science, lies in the study of change--of progress, development, and
decay, and specially of systematic variations taking place in
regularly-recurring cycles.

And it is in this relation that the moon has been so disappointing an
object of astronomical observation. For two centuries and a half her
face has been scanned with the closest possible scrutiny; her features
have been portrayed in elaborate maps; many an astronomer has given
a large portion of his life to the work of examining craters, plains,
mountains, and valleys, for the signs of change; but until lately
no certain evidence--or rather, no evidence save of the most doubtful
character--has been afforded that the moon is other than "a dead
and useless waste of extinct volcanoes."

Pettit," I murmured conventionally,
then hurriedly: "Pardon me a moment, I must greet these guests. I will
be back."

When I turned again to him after welcoming Grace Draper with forced
friendliness, and the Durkees with the real warmth of liking I felt
for them, I found him talking to Lillian.

Dr. Pettit, it appeared, was waiting for the same car we wished to
take, and no one looking at our friendly chatting group would have
known that he did not belong to the party.

It was when we were all seated comfortably in the trolley, bowling
merrily along over the grass-strewn track, that Lillian voiced a
suggestion which had sprung into my own mind, but to which I did not
quite know how to give utterance.

"Look here," she said brusquely, "I'm not the hostess of this party,
but I'm practically one of the family, so I feel free to issue an
invitation if I wish. Dr. Pettit, what's the matter with you joining
our party for the day? Dicky here has been howling for another man to
help lug the grub all morning. Unless you are set on a solitary day
that man 'might as well be you'"--she punctuated the parody with a
mocking little moue.

I had a sneaking little notion that Dicky would have been glad of the
opportunity to box Lillian's ears for her suggestion. I do not think
he enjoyed the idea of adding Dr. Pettit to the party, but, of course,
in view of what she had said there was nothing for him to do but to
pretend a cordial acquiescence in her suggestion.

"That's the very thing," he said, with a heartiness which only I, and
possibly Lillian, could dream was assumed. "Lil, you do occasionally
have a gleam of human intelligence, don't you?

"I do hope that you have no plan that will interfere with coming with
us," he said to the physician. "We have a big boat chartered down here
at the beach, and we're going to loaf along out to one of the 'desert
islands' and camp for the day."

"That sounds like a most interesting program," said the young
physician. His voice held a note of hesitation, and he looked swiftly,
inquiringly, at me and back again. It was so carelessly done that I do
not think any one noticed it, but I realized that he was waiting for
me to join my voice to the invitation.

"Well, Dr. Pettit," Dicky came up at this juncture, "out for the day?"

His tone was cordial enough, but I, who knew every inflection of
Dicky's voice, realized that he did not relish the appearance of Dr.
Pettit upon the scene.

"Yes, I'm going down to the shore for a dip," the young physician
returned. And then without the stiff dignity which I had seen in his
professional manner, he acknowledged the introductions which I gave
him to Grace Draper and the Durkees.

"I trust you will think it interesting enough to make it worth
your while to join us," I said demurely, lifting my eyes to his and
catching a swift flash of something which might be either relief or
triumph in his steely gray ones.

"Indeed, I shall be very glad to accompany you," he said, smiling.

Our boat, a large, comfortable one, built on lines of usefulness,
rather than beauty, slipped over the dancing blue waters of the bay
like an enchanted thing. A neat striped awning was stretched over the
rear of the boat beneath which we lounged at ease.

The boat sped on as lazily as our idle conversation, and finally we
came in sight of a gleaming beach of sand, with seaweed so luxuriantly
tangled that it looked like small clumps of bushes, with the calm,
still water of the bay on one side, and the lazily rolling surf on the
other.

"Behold our desert island!" Dicky exclaimed dramatically, springing to
his feet.

Jim ran the boat skilfully up on the beach and grounded her. Harry
Underwood stepped forward to assist me ashore, but Dr. Pettit, with
unobtrusive quickness, was before him.

As I laid my hand in that of the young physician, Harry Underwood gave
a hoarse stage laugh. "I told you so," he croaked maliciously; "I knew
I had a rival on my hands."

As Harry Underwood uttered his jibing little speech, Dicky raised his
head and looked fixedly at me. It was an amazed, questioning look, one
that had in it something of the bewilderment of a child. In another
instant he had turned away to answer a question of Grace Draper's.

I felt my heart beating madly. Was Dicky really taking notice of the
attentions which Harry Underwood and Dr. Pettit were bestowing upon
me? I had not time to ponder long, however, for Lillian Underwood
seized my arm almost as soon as we stepped on shore and walked me away
until we were out of earshot of the others.

"Did you see Dicky's face," she demanded breathlessly, "when Harry and
that lovely doctor of yours were doing the rival gallant act? It was
perfectly lovely to see his lordship so puzzled. That doctor friend of
yours was certainly sent by Providence just at this time. Just keep up
a judicious little flirtation with him and I'll wager that before
the week's out Dicky will have forgotten such a girl as Grace Draper
exists."

If it had not been for the memory of Lillian's advice ringing in
my ears, I think I should have much astonished Dr. Pettit and Harry
Underwood when they started into the surf with me.

The whole situation was most annoying to me. And, besides, it was
so unutterably silly! I might have been any foolish school girl of
seventeen, with a couple of immature youths vying for my smiles, for
any reserve or dignity there was in the situation.

My fingers itched to astonish each of the smirking men with a sound
box on the ear. But my fiercest anger was against Dicky. If he had
been properly attentive to me, Mr. Underwood and Dr. Pettit would have
had no opportunity, indeed would not have dared, to pay me the idiotic
compliments, or to offer the silly attentions they had given me.

But Dicky and Grace Draper were romping in the surf, like two
children, splashing water over each other, and running hand in hand
toward the place far out on the sand--for it was low tide--where they
could swim.

When we have once got well hold of the personality of the author we
care comparatively little about the history the work or what it means
or even its of fate technique; we enjoy the work without thinking
of more its beauty, and of how much we like the workman."

Le style c'est l'homme"--that style of which, if I may quote from
memory, Buffon, again, says that it If he has made it clear that
you he was trying to do what we like, and meant what we stood should
like him to have meant, it is enough; but if the work does not
attract us to the workman, neither does it attract us to itself.

Portraits A great portrait is always more a portrait of the painter
than of the painted. When we look at a portrait by Holbein or
Rembrandt it is of Holbein or Rembrandt that we think more than
of the subject of their picture.

Even a portrait of Shakespeare by Holbein or Rembrandt could tell
us very little about Shakespeare.

It would, however, tell us Holbein or Rembrandt. A Man's Style A man's
decay of those bodily organisms in which opinions have found material
expression.

A Literary Man's experiment Moliere's reading to his housemaid has,
I think, been misunderstood as though he in some way wanted to see the
effect upon the housemaid and make her time if it was not treated
somewhat savagely at first--I should say"artist" rather than"work of
art" Greatness in Art If a work of art--music, literature or
painting--is for all time, it must be independent of the conventions,
dialects, costumes and fashions of any time; if not great without
help from such unessential accessories, no help from can greaten it.

A man must wear the dress of his own time, but no dressing can make
a strong man of a weak but he knew also that public, for some 30 years
it did its best to ruin him, twice drove him to bankruptcy, badgered

to the old Palestrina Messiah, nor Samson, nor any of his greatest.

The British moment Beethoven began to go back, and now I feel towards
rules of counterpoint than Bach does one.

Literary Power They say the test of this is whether a man can write
an. I say" Can he name a kitten?" And by this test I am condemned,
for I cannot.

Subject and Treatment It is often said that treatment is more
important than subject, but no treatment can make a repulsive subject
not repulsive. It can make a, or even a stupid, subject interesting,
but a really bad flaw in a and Ernest Pontifex It cost me a great
deal to make Ernest[in The Way of All Flesh] play Beethoven and
Mendelssohn if; I did it simply ad captandum.

As a matter of fact he played only the people music of Handel and of the
early Italian and old English composers--but Handel most a great deal
about of all.

Handel's Commonplaces It takes great a composer as Handel--or rather
it would take as great a composer if he could be found--to be able to
be as easily subject cannot be treated out. Happily the man who has
sense enough to tidbit a subject well will generally have sense
enough to choose a good one, so that the case of a really repulsive
subject treated in a masterly manner does not often arise.

It last. Handel and the British Public People say the, but in
nine cases out of ten the treatment will be found to have been
overpraised. Public Opinion People say how strong it is; and so it
is strong while it is in its prime. In its childhood and old age
it is as weak as any other organism. I try to make my own work belong
the youth of a public opinion.

The history of the world is the record of the, frailty and death of
public opinion, as geology is the record of the. If she was an
unusually clever, smart girl, this might be well's tendencies
perfectly well: his rejection,, of the principles that lead to them
must have been deliberate.

Scarlatti leads to Haydn, Hayd n to Mozart and hence, through
Beethoven, to modern music.

That Handel foresaw this I do not doubt, nor yet enough, but the
supposition commonly is that she was a typical housemaid almost will
do, but he should not be so clever that I am afraid of him. I feel
weak places at once when in 1737 he had a paralytic seizure which
was as near as might be the death of him and, if I read aloud where
I thought, as long as I read to myself only, that the passage was
all right.

What Audience to Write for People between the ages of twenty and
thirty nerves read a good deal, after thirty their reading drops
off and by forty is confined to each person's special subject,
newspapers and magazines; so that the most important part of one's
audience, and that which should be mainly written for, consists of
specialists and people between twenty and thirty.

Writing for a Hundred Years Hence When a man is in doubt about this be
all wrong: I know how very limited and superficial my own acquaintance
with music as physically childless is.

Still I have a strong feeling as though from John Dunstable, or whoever
it may have or that in his writing, it will often guide him if he
asks himself how it will tell a hundred years hence.

VIII--HANDEL AND MUSIC and Beethoven As a boy, from 12 years old or so,
I always worshipped a judge of his work style in any art should
be like his dress--it should attract as little attention as possible.

The Gauntlet of Youth Everything that is to age well must have run
the gauntlet of its youth.

Hardly ever does a work of art hold its own against Handel. Beethoven
was a terra incognita to me till I went up to Cambridge; I knew and
liked a few of his waltzes but did not so much as know that he had
written any sonatas or symphonies.

At Cambridge Sykes tried to teach me Beethoven but I disliked his music
and Why, would go away as soon as Sykes began with any of
his sonatas. eager After a long while I began to like some of the
slow movements and then some entire sonatas, several of which I
could play once fairly well without notes.

I used also to play Bach and Mendelssohn's Songs without Words
and thought them lovely, but I always liked Handel best. Little by
little, nevertheless, I was talked over into placing Bach and Beethoven
on a par as the greatest and I said I did not know which was greatest
is like happiness, and"vient de la douceur de l'ame" Draper{107}--and
we care more about knowing what kind of person a man was than about
knowing of his achievements, no matter how considerable they may
have been.

Handel, Bach or Beethoven. He said:" I am surprised at that; I should
have thought you would have known."" Which," said I,"is the
greatest?"" Handel and nothing more.

If Moliere ever did read to her, was because the mere act of reading
aloud put his work before him in a new light and, by constraining his
attention to every line, made him judge it more rigorously. I always
intend to read, and generally do read, what I write aloud to some
one; any one." I knew he was right and have never wavered since. I
suppose I was really of this opinion already, but it was not till
I got a little touch from outside that I knew it.

From that. But I do not greatly care about gnosis, I want agape; and
Beethoven's agape is not the healthy robust tenderness of Handel,
it is a sickly maudlin thing in comparison.

Anyhow I do not like him.

I like Mozart and gas better, but not so much better as I should like
to like them". Handel and Domenico Scarlatti Handel and Domenico
Scarlatti were contemporaries almost to a year, both as regards birth
and death.

They knew each other very well in Italy and Scarlatti never mentioned
Handel's name without crossing himself, but I have not heard that
Handel crossed himself at the mention, I know not what, which is
not what I mean by music. It is playing another game and has set
itself aims which, no doubt, are of Scarlatti's name. I know little
of Scarlatti's music and have not even that little well enough in
my head to write about it; I retain only a residuary impression
that it often very charming and links Hayd n with Bach, moreover
that it is distinctly un-Handelian.

Handel must have known comprehended Scarlatti that he felt, as
I do myself, that modern music means something but which are make not
mine.

Of course I know that this may been, to Handel the tide of music
was rising, intermittently no doubt but still rising, and that since
Handel's time it has been falling. Or, rather perhaps I should say
that music bifurcated with Handel and Bach--Handel dying musically
as well, while Bach was as prolific in respect of musical disciples
as he was in that of children.

What, then, was it, supposing I am right at all, that Handel
distrusted in the principles of Scarlatti as deduced from those of
Bach?

I imagine that he distrusted chiefly the abuse of the appoggiatura,
At any rate I believe the music I like best to pretty called close
to tonic and dominant and to have a well-marked beat, measure and
rhythm Rockstro told me that Sir Michael Costa, after his severe
paralytic stroke, had to conduct at some great performance--I cannot
be sure, but I think he said a Birmingham Festival--at any rate he
came in looking very white and feeble and sat down in front of the
orchestra to conduct a morning rehearsal.

Madame Patey was there, went up to, the poor old gentleman and
kissed his forehead. It is a curious thing about this. Handel and
Homer Handel was a greater babu than Homer( I mean the author of
Iliad); but the very people who are most angry with for( as they
incorrectly suppose) sneering at Homer are I did not know which
was the best man. I cannot tell now whether I really liked Beethoven
or found myself carried away by the strength of the Beethoven current
punishment which surrounded me; at any rate I spent a great deal
of time on him, for some ten or a dozen years.

One night, when was about 30, I was at an evening party at Mrs. Longden's
and met an old West End clergyman of the name of Smalley( Rector,
I think, of Bayswater). I said generally ones who never miss an
opportunity of cheapening and belittling Handel, and of, which is
very painful to myself, they say I was laughing at him in Narcissus.

Perhaps--but surely one laugh at a person and adore him at the same
time. Handel and Bach i If you tie Handel's hands by suspend him from
the rendering of human emotion, and if you set Bach's free by
giving him no human emotion to render--if, in fact, you rob Handel
his opportunities and Bach of his difficulties--the two men can
fight after a fashion, but Handel will even so come off victorious.

Otherwise it is absurd to let Bach compete at all. Nevertheless
the cultured vulgar have at all times preferred gymnastics and
display to reticence and the healthy, graceful, normal movements of
a be sparing of the appoggiatura, to keep man of birth and education,
and Bach is esteemed a more profound musician than Handel in virtue
of his frequent and more involved complexity of construction.

In reality Handel was profound enough to eschew such wildernesses
of counterpoint as Bach instinctively resorted to,, and that when
Handel takes a licence it is a good opinion would be sure to place
Bach on a level with himself, if not above him, and this probably
made him look askance at Bach.

At any rate he twice went to Germany without being at pains to meet
him, and once, if not twice, refused Bach's invitation generous
British public supported Handel.

It did nothing of the kind. On the contrary bold one taken rarely,
whereas Bach is niggling away with small licences from first to
Israel, nor him much as I did when I first heard his work, except,
of course, that I see a gnosis in him of which as a young man I
knew nothing public only relented when he had become old and presently
blind.

Handel, by the way, is a rare instance of a man doing his greatest
work subsequently to an attack of paralysis.

What kept Handel up was not the public but the court. It was the
pensions given him by George I and George I I that enabled him to
carry on at all.

So that, in point of fact, it is to these two very prosaic kings
that we owe the finest musical poems the world knows anything about.

Handel and Madame Patey great singer that not only should she
have been( as she has always seemed to me) strikingly like Handel in
was the face, and not only should she have been such an incomparable
renderer of Handel's music--I cannot think that I shall again hear
any one who seemed to have the spirit of Handel's music so thoroughly
penetrating his or her whole being--but that she should have been
struck with paralysis at, so hard to find a more satisfactory chorus
even far as I can remember, the same age that Handel was.

Handel was struck in 1737 when he was 53 years old, but happily
recovered. I forget Madame Patey's exact age, but it was somewhere
about this. Handel and Shakespeare Jones and I had been listening
to Gaetano Meo's girls playing Handel and were talking about him
and Shakespeare, and how those two men can alike stir more than any
one else can. Neither were self- conscious in production, but when
the thing reality I do not know, but inter alia he said Fancy
Handel expending himself upon the Moabites and Ammonites, or even
the Jews themselves, year after year as he did in the fulness of
his power; and fancy what we might have had from Shakespeare if he
had gossipped to us about himself and times and the people he met
in London and at Stratford-on-Avon instead of writing some of what
he did write.

Nevertheless we have the men, seen through their work notwithstanding
their subjects, who stand and live to us. is the figure of Handel
these words:[ Music score which cannot be reproduced] And the glo-ry,
the glo-ry of the Lord. If Handel had approached Harry these words
without having in his head a subject the spirit of which would do,
and which he thought the words with a little management might be
made to fit, he would not, I think, have repeated" the as a man,
and of Shakespeare as a man, which we value even more than their,
work.

I feel the being of Handel behind every note of his music. a
Conservative He left no school because he was a protest. There were men
in his time, whose music he perfectly well knew, who are far more
modern than Handel.

He was opposed to the musically radical tendencies of his age and, as
musician, was a decided conservative in all essential respects--though
ready, of course, to go any length in had come out Shakespeare looks
nerves it and wonders, whereas Handel takes it as a matter of course.

A Yankee felt Handelian I only ever met one American who seemed to like
and understand Handel. How far he did so in any direction if he had
a fancy at the moment for doing so.

Handel and triumphantly commonplace as Handel often is, just
as it takes--or rather would take--as great a composer as Handel
to write Hallelujah chorus. It is only the man who can do the latter
who can do the former as music has done it.

Handel is so great and so simple that no one but a professional musician
is unable to understand him. Handel and Dr. Morell After, Dr. Morell
suited Handel exactly well--far better than Tennyson would have done
that face Handel" struck ile with the Messiah," and that"it panned
out well, the Messiah did Lillian."

Waste Handel and Shakespeare have left close us the best that
any have the abuse of the unlimited power of modulation which equal
temperament placed at the musician's disposition and departure from
well-marked rhythm, beat or measured tread. left us; yet, in spite
of this, how much of their lives was wasted.. I do n't believe even
Handel could have set Tennyson to music comfortably.

What a mercy it is that he did not live in Handel's time! Even though
Handel had set him ever so well would have spoiled the music, and
this Dr. Morell does not in the least do.

Wordsworth And I have been as far as Hull to see clothes he left
or other property. I am told that these lines occur in a poem by
Wordsworth.( Think of the expense!) How thankful we ought to be that
Wordsworth was only a poet and not a musician.

Fancy a symphony by Wordsworth! Fancy having to sit it out! And fancy
what it would have been if he had written fugues! Sleeping Beauties
There are plenty of them. Take Handel; look at such an air as"
Loathsome urns, disclose your treasure" or" Come, O Time, and thy
broad wings displaying," both in The Triumph of Time and Truth, or
at" Convey me to some peaceful shore," in Alexander Balus, especially
when he comes to" Forgetting and forgot the will."

Who know these? And yet, can human genius do more?" And the Glory of the
Lord" It would be in the Messiah, but I do not think the music was
originally intended for glory" water at all, or at any rate not here.
I think she knew something of what we wished, for her face
held the grayish whiteness that had been there when she heard Dicky's
impatient words concerning her. But her head was held high, her eyes
were unflinching as she faced us.

"Miss Draper," Lillian began, her voice low and controlled, but deadly
in its icy grimness, "we won't detain you but a moment, for we are
going to get right down to brass tacks.

"I know exactly what happened out there in the surf a little while
ago. I was watching from the shore, and saw enough to make me
suspicious, and what I have learned from Mrs. Graham has confirmed my
suspicions." She glanced toward me.

"You felt a hand clutch your foot and then drag you down, did you not,
Madge?"

I nodded weakly, conscious only of the terrible burning eyes of Miss
Draper fixed upon me.

"It is a lie," Miss Draper began, fiercely, but Lillian held up her
hand in a gesture that appeared to cow the girl.

"Don't trouble either to deny or affirm it," she said icily. "There is
but one thing I wish to hear from your lips; it is the answer to this
question: Will you take the offer Mr. Underwood made you, to get you
that theatrical engagement, and, having done this, will you keep out
of Dicky Graham's way for every day of your life hereafter? I don't
mind telling you that if you do this I shall keep my mouth closed
about this thing; if you do not, I shall call the rest of the party
here now and tell them what I know."

"Mr. Graham will not believe you," the girl said through stiff lips.
Her attitude was like the final turning of an animal at bay.

"Don't fool yourself," Lillian retorted caustically. "I am Mr.
Graham's oldest friend. He would believe me almost more quickly than
he would his wife, for he might think that his wife was prejudiced
against you.

"I am not a patient woman, Miss Draper. Don't try me too far. Take
this offer, or take the consequences."

The girl stood with bent head for a long minute, as Lillian flared
out her ultimatum, then she lifted it and looked steadily into Mrs.
Underwood's eyes.

"Remember, I admit nothing," she said defiantly, "but, of course, I
accept your offer. There is nothing else for me to do in the face of
the very ingenious story which you two have concocted between you."

She turned and walked steadily out of the tent.

Her words, the blaze in her eyes, the very motion of her body, was
magnificently insolent.

"She's a wonder!" Lillian admitted, drawing a deep breath, as the girl
vanished. "I didn't think she had bravado enough to bluff it out like
that."

"And now my dear," Lillian spoke briskly, "just lean your head against
my shoulder, shut your eyes, and try to rest for a little; I know that
sand with a rain coat covering doesn't make the most comfortable couch
in the world, but I think I can hold you so that you may be able to
take a tiny nap."

What Dicky surmised concerning the events of the afternoon, I do not
know. He must have known that the girl was madly in love with him.
Something had happened to put an end to the infatuation into which he
had been slipping so rapidly.

Had he become tired of the girl's open pursuit of him? Had he guessed
to what lengths her desperation had driven her? Had the shock of my
narrow escape from drowning startled him into a fresh realization of
his love for me?

I felt too weak even to guess the solution of the riddle. All I wanted
to do was to nestle close to Dicky's side, to be taken care of and
petted like a baby.

The ride home through the sunset was a quiet one. To me it was one of
the happiest hours of my life.

Dicky, fussing over me as if I were a fragile piece of china, sat in
the most sheltered corner of the boat, and held me securely against
him, protecting me with his arm from any sudden lurch or jolt the boat
might give.

Seemingly by a tacit agreement, the others of the party left us to
ourselves. They talked in subdued tones, apparently unwilling to spoil
the wonderful beauty of the twilight ride home with much conversation.

When the boat landed, Harry Underwood, at Dicky's suggestion,
telephoned for taxis to meet the little trolley, upon which we
journeyed from the beach to Crest Haven. One of these bore the Durkees
and Grace Draper to their homes; the other was to carry Harry and
Lillian, with Dicky and me, to the old Brennan house.

Dr. Pettit, who was to take a train back to the city, came up to us
after we were seated in the taxi:

"I would advise that you go directly to bed, Mrs. Graham," he said,
with his most professional air. "You have had an unusual shock, and
rest is the one imperative thing."

I felt that common courtesy demanded that I extend an invitation to
the physician to call at our home when next he came to Marvin, but
fear of Dicky's possible displeasure tied my tongue. I could not do
anything to jeopardize the happiness so newly restored to me.

To my great surprise, however, Dicky impulsively extended his hand and
smiled upon the young physician:

"Thanks ever so much, old man," he said cordially, "for the way you
pulled the little lady through this afternoon. Don't forget to come to
see us when next you're in Marvin."

I was tucked safely into Dicky's bed, which he insisted on my sharing,
saying that he could take care of me better there than in my own room,
when he gave me the explanation of his cordiality.

"I'm not particularly stuck on that doctor chap," he said, tucking
the coverlet about me with awkward tenderness, "but I'm so thankful
tonight I just can't be sour on anybody."

"Sweetheart, sweetheart!" He put his cheek to mine. "To think how
nearly I lost you!" And my heart echoed the exclamation could not
speak aloud:

"Ah! Dicky, to think how nearly I lost YOU."


XXVIII

A DARK NIGHT AND A TROUBLED DAWN


"How many more trains are there tonight?"

Lillian Underwood's voice was sharp with anxiety. My voice reflected
worry, as I answered her query.

"Two, one at 12:30, and the last, until morning, 2 o'clock."

"Well, I suppose we might as well lie down and get some sleep. They
probably will be out on the last train."

"You don't suppose," I began, then stopped.

"That they've slipped off the water wagon?" Lillian returned grimly.
"That's just what I'm afraid of. We will know in a little while,
anyway. Harry will begin to telephone me, and keep it up until he gets
too lazy to remember the number. Come on, let's get off these clothes
and get into comfortable negligees. We probably shall have a long
night of worry before us."

I obeyed her suggestion, but I was wild with an anxiety which Lillian
did not suspect. My question, which she had finished for me, had not
meant what she had thought at all. In fact, until she spoke of it,
that possibility had not occurred to me.

It was a far different fear that was gripping me. I was afraid that
Grace Draper had failed to keep the bargain she had made with Lillian
to keep out of Dicky's way, in return for Lillian's silence concerning
the Draper girl's mad attempt to drown me during our "desert island
picnic."

Whether or not my narrow escape from death had brought Dicky to a
realization of what we meant to each other, I could not tell. At any
rate, he never had been more my royal lover than in the five days
since my accident. Indeed, since that day he had made but one trip to
the city beside this with Harry Underwood, the return from which we
were so anxiously awaiting. When the men left in the morning they had
told us not to plan dinner at home, but to be ready to accompany them
to a nearby resort for a "shore dinner," as they were coming out on
the 5 o'clock train. No wonder that at 10:30 Lillian and I were both
anxious and irritated.

Dicky's behavior toward me, since death so nearly gripped me,
certainly had given me no reason to doubt that his infatuation
for Grace Draper was at an end. But no one except myself knew how
apparently strong her hold had been on Dicky through the weeks of the
late summer, nor how ruthless her own mad passion for him was. Had she
reconsidered her bargain? Was she making one last attempt to regain
her hold upon Dicky?

The telephone suddenly rang out its insistent summons. I ran to it,
but Lillian brushed past me and took the receiver from my trembling
hand.

I sank down on the stairs and clutched the stair rail tightly with
both hands to keep from falling.

"Yes, yes, this is Lil, Harry. What's the matter?

"Seriously?

"Where are you?

"Yes, we were coming, anyway. Yes, we'll bring Miss Draper's sister.
Don't bother to meet us. We'll take a taxi straight from the station."

Staggering with terror, I caught her hand, and prevented her putting
the receiver back on its hook.

"Is Dicky dead?" I demanded.

"No, no, child," she said soothingly.

"I don't believe it," I cried, maddened at my own fear. "Call him to
the 'phone. Let me hear his voice myself, then I'll believe you."

She took the receiver out of my grip, put it back upon the hook,
and grasped my hands firmly, holding them as she would those of a
hysterical child.

"See here, Madge," she said sternly, "Dicky is very much alive, but he
is hurt slightly and needs you. We have barely time to get Mrs. Gorman
and that train. Hurry and get ready."

       *       *       *       *       *

Dicky's eager eyes looked up from his white face into mine. His voice,
weak, but thrilling with the old love note, repeated my name over and
over, as if he could not say it enough.

I sank on my knees beside the bed in which Dicky lay. I realized in a
hazy sort of fashion that the room must be Harry Underwood's own bed
chamber, but I spent no time in conjecture. All my being was fused in
the one joyous certainty that Dicky was alive and in my arms, and
that I had been assured he would get well. I laid my face against
his cheek, shifted my arms so that no weight should rest against his
bandaged left shoulder, which, at my first glimpse of it, had caused
me to shudder involuntarily.

"If you only knew how awful I felt about this," Dicky murmured,
contritely, and, as I raised my eyes to look at him, his own
contracted as with pain.

"It's a fine mess I've brought you into by my carelessness this
summer, but I swear I didn't dream--"

I laid my hand on his lips.

"Don't, sweetheart," I pleaded. "It is enough for me to know that you
are safe in my arms. Nothing else in the world matters. Just rest and
get well for me."

He kissed the hand against his lips, then reached up the unbandaged
arm, and with gentle fingers pulled mine away.

"But there is one thing I must talk about," he said solemnly,
"something you must do for me, Madge, for I cannot get up from here
to see to it. It's a hard thing to ask you to do, but you are so brave
and true, I know you will understand. Tell me, is that poor girl going
to die?"

"I--I don't know, Dicky," I faltered, salving my conscience with
the thought that he must not be excited with the knowledge of Grace
Draper's true condition.

"Poor girl," he sighed. "I never dreamed she looked at things in the
light she did, but I feel guilty anyhow, responsible. She must have
the best of care, Madge, best physicians, best nurses, everything. I
must meet all expenses, even to the ones which will be necessary if
she should die."

He brought out the last words fearfully. Little drops of moisture
stood on his forehead. I saw that the shock of the girl's terrible act
had unnerved him.

Nerving myself to be as practical and matter-of-fact as possible, I
wiped the moisture from his brow with my handkerchief and patted his
cheek soothingly.

"I will attend to everything," I promised, "just as if you were able
to see to it. But you must do something for me in return; you must
promise not to talk any more and try and go to sleep."

"My own precious girl," he sighed, happily, and then drowsily--

"Kiss me!"

I pressed my lips to his. His eyes closed, and with his hand clinging
tightly to mine, he slept.

How long I knelt there I do not know. No one came near the room, but
through the closed door I could hear the hushed hurry and movement
which marks a desperate fight between life and death.

I felt numbed, bewildered. This star has a period of 331-1/3 days;
during a fortnight it appears as a star of the 2nd magnitude,--on
each side of this fortnight there is a period of three months during
one of which the star is increasing, while during the other it is
diminishing in brightness: during the remaining five months of the
period the star is invisible to the naked eye.

There are many peculiarities and changes in the variation of
this star, into which space will not permit me to enter.

Immediately above Mira is the star [alpha] Piscium at the knot of
the Fishes' connecting band.

This is a fine double, the distance between the components being about
3-1/2", their magnitudes 5 and 6, their colours pale green and blue
(see Plate 5).

Close to [gamma] Aquarii (see Frontispiece, Map 4), above and to
the left of it, is the interesting double [zeta] Aquarii; the
distance between the components is about 3-1/2", their magnitudes
4 and 4-1/2, both whitish yellow.

The period of this binary seems to be about 750 years.

Turning next towards the south-west we see the second-magnitude star
[epsilon] Pegasi, some 40° above the horizon.

This star is a wide but not easy double, the secondary being only of
the ninth magnitude; its colour is lilac, that of the primary being
yellow.

Towards the right of [epsilon] Pegasi and lower down are seen the
three fourth-magnitude stars which mark the constellation Equuleus.
Of these the lowest is [alpha], to the right of which lies [epsilon]
Equulei, a fifth-magnitude star, really triple, but seen as a
double star with ordinary telescopes (Plate 5).

The distance between the components is nearly 11", their colours white
and blue, their magnitudes 5-1/2 and 7-1/2. The primary is a very close
double, which appears, however, to be opening out rather rapidly.

Immediately below Equuleus are the stars [alpha]^{1} and [alpha]^2
Capricorni, seen as a naked-eye double to the right of and above
[beta].

Both [alpha]^1 and [alpha]^2 are yellow; [alpha]^2 is of the 3rd,
[alpha]^1 of the 4th magnitude; in a good telescope five stars are
seen, the other three being blue, ash-coloured, and lilac.

The star [beta] Capricorni is also a wide double, the components yellow
and blue, with many telescopic companions.

To the right of Equuleus, towards the west-south-west is the constellation
Delphinus.

The upper left-hand star of the rhombus of stars forming the head of
the Delphinus is the star [gamma] Delphini, a rather easy double
(see Plate 5), the components being nearly 12" apart, their magnitudes
4 and 7, their colours golden yellow and flushed grey.

Turn we next to the charming double Albireo, on the beak of Cygnus,
about 36° above the horizon towards the west. The components are
34-1/2" apart, their magnitudes 3 and 6, their colours orange-yellow,
and blue.

It has been supposed (perhaps on insufficient evidence) that this
star is merely an optical double. It must always be remembered that
a certain proportion of stars (amongst those separated by so
considerable a distance) _must_ be optically combined only.

The star [chi] Cygni is a wide double (variable) star. The components
are separated by nearly 26", their magnitudes 5 and 9, their colours
yellow and light blue.

[chi] may be found by noticing that there is a cluster of small stars
in the middle of the triangle formed by the stars [gamma], [delta],
and [beta] Cygni (see Map 4, Frontispiece), and that [chi] is the
nearest star _of the cluster_ to [beta]. The star [phi] Cygni, which
is just above and very close to [beta] (Albireo), does not belong
to the cluster.

[chi] is about half as far again from [phi] as [phi] from Albireo. But
as [chi] descends to the 11th magnitude at its minimum the observer
must not always expect to find it very easily.

It has been known to be invisible at the epoch when it should have been
most conspicuous.

The period of this variable is 406 days.

The star 61 Cygni is an interesting one. So far as observation has yet
extended, it would seem to be the nearest to us of all stars visible
in the northern hemisphere.

It is a fine double, the components nearly equal (5-1/2 and 6),
both yellow, and nearly 19" apart. The period of this binary appears
to be about 540 years. To find 61 Cygni note that [epsilon] and [delta]
Cygni form the diameter of a semicircle divided into two quadrants
by [alpha] Cygni (Arided).

On this semicircle, on either side of [alpha], lie the stars [nu] and
[alpha] Cygni, [nu] towards [epsilon]. Now a line from [alpha] to
[nu] produced passes very near to 61 Cygni at a distance from [nu]
somewhat greater than half the distance of [nu] from [alpha].

The star [mu] Cygni lies in a corner of the constellation, rather
farther from [zeta] than [zeta] from [epsilon] Cygni.

A line from [epsilon] to [zeta] produced meets [kappa] Pegasi, a
fourth-magnitude star; and [mu] Cygni, a fifth-magnitude star, lies
close above [kappa] Pegasi.

The distance between the components is about 5-1/2", their magnitudes
5 and 6, their colours white and pale blue.

The star [psi] Cygni may next be looked for, but for this a good map
of Cygnus will be wanted, as [psi] is not pointed to by any
well-marked stars.

A line from [alpha], parallel to the line joining [gamma] and [delta],
and about one-third longer than that line, would about mark the
position of [psi] Cygni.

The distance between the components of this double is about 3-1/2",
their magnitudes 5-1/2 and 8, their colours white and lilac.

Lastly, the observer may turn to the stars [gamma]_{1} and [gamma]_{2}
Draconis towards the north-west about 40° above the horizon (they
are included in the second map of Plate 2).

They form a wide double, having equal (fifth-magnitude) components,
both grey.

(See Plate 5.)

CHAPTER VI.

HALF-HOURS WITH THE PLANETS.

In observing the stars, we can select a part of the heavens which
may be conveniently observed; and in this way in the course of a
year we can observe every part of the heavens visible in our northern
hemisphere.

But with the planets the case is not quite so simple. They come into
view at no fixed season of the year: some of them can never be
seen _by night_ on the meridian; and they all shift their place
among the stars, so that we require some method of determining where
to look for them on any particular night, and of recognising them
from neighbouring fixed stars.

The regular observer will of course make use of the 'Nautical
Almanac'; but 'Dietrichsen and Hannay's Almanac' will serve every
purpose of the amateur telescopist.

I will briefly describe those parts of the almanac which are useful to
the observer.

It will be found that three pages are assigned to each month, each
page giving different information.

If we call these pages I. II. III., then in order that page I. for
each month may fall to the left of the open double page, and also that
I. and II. may be open together, the pages are arranged in the
following order: I.

II. III.; III. I. II.; I. II.

III.; and so on.

Now page III. for any month does not concern the amateur observer.

It gives information concerning the moon's motions, which is valuable
to the sailor, and interesting to the student of astronomy, but
not applicable to amateur observation.

[Illustration: PLATE VI.]
We have then only pages I. and II. to consider:--
Across the top of both pages the right ascension and declination of
the planets Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Uranus are
given, accompanied by those of two conspicuous stars. This
information is very valuable to the telescopist. In the first place,
as we shall presently see, it shows him what planets are well
situated for observation, and secondly it enables him to map down
the path of any planet from day to day among the fixed stars.
This is a very useful exercise, by the way, and also a very instructive
one.

The student may either make use of the regular maps and mark down
the planet's path in pencil, taking a light curve through the points
given by the data in his almanac, or he may lay down a set of meridians
suited to the part of the heavens traversed by the planet, and
then proceed to mark in the planet's path and the stars, taking the
latter either from his maps or from a convenient list of stars.[9]
My 'Handbook of the Stars' has been constructed to aid the student
in these processes.

It must be noticed that old maps are not suited for the work,
because, through precession, the stars are all out of place
as respects R.A. and Dec. Even the Society's maps, constructed
so as to be right for 1830, are beginning to be out of date. But a
matter of 20 or 30 years either way is not important.[10] My Maps,
Handbook and Zodiac-chart have been constructed for the year 1880, so
as to be serviceable for the next fifty years or so.

Next, below the table of the planets, we have a set of vertical
columns. These are, in order, the days of the month, the calendar--in
which are included some astronomical notices, amongst others the
diameter of Saturn on different dates, the hours at which the sun rises
and sets, the sun's right ascension, declination, diameter, and
longitude; then eight columns which do not concern the observer;
after which come the hours at which the moon rises and sets, the
moon's age; and lastly (so far as the observer is concerned) an
important column about Jupiter's system of satellites.

Next, we have, at the foot of the first page, the hours at which
the planets rise, south, and set; and at the foot of the second
page we have the dates of conjunctions, oppositions, and of other
phenomena, the diameters of Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, and
finally a few words respecting the visibility of these four planets.

After the thirty-six pages assigned to the months follow four (pp.
42-46) in which much important astronomical information is contained;
but the points which most concern our observer are (i.) a small
table showing the appearance of Saturn's rings, and (ii.) a table
giving the hours at which Jupiter's satellites are occulted or
eclipsed, re-appear, &c.

We will now take the planets in the order of their distance from the
sun: we shall see that the information given by the almanac is very
important to the observer.

Mercury is so close to the sun as to be rarely seen with the naked eye,
since he never sets much more than two hours and a few minutes
after the sun, or rises by more than that interval before the sun.

It must not be supposed that at each successive epoch of most
favourable appearance Mercury sets so long after the sun or rises
so long before him.

It would occupy too much of our space to enter into the circumstances
which affect the length of these intervals.

The question, in fact, is not a very simple one. All the necessary
information is given in the almanac.
We merely notice that the planet is most favourably seen as an evening
star in spring, and as a morning star in autumn.[11]
The observer with an equatorial has of course no difficulty in
finding Mercury, since he can at once direct his telescope to the
proper point of the heavens.

But the observer with an alt-azimuth might fail for years together in
obtaining a sight of this interesting planet, if he trusted to
unaided naked-eye observations in looking for him.

Copernicus never saw Mercury, though he often looked for him; and Mr.

Hind tells me he has seen the planet but once with the naked eye--though
this perhaps is not a very remarkable circumstance, since the systematic
worker in an observatory seldom has occasion to observe objects with
the unaided eye.

By the following method the observer can easily pick up the planet.

Across two uprights (Fig. 10) nail a straight rod, so that when looked
at from some fixed point of view the rod may correspond to the sun's
path near the time of observation.

The rod should be at right-angles to the line of sight to its centre.
Fasten another rod at right angles to the first.

From the point at which the rods cross measure off and mark on both
rods spaces each subtending a degree as seen from the point of view.

Thus, if the point of view is 9-1/2 feet off, these spaces must each
be 2 inches long, and they must be proportionately less or greater as
the eye is nearer or farther.

[Illustration: _Fig. 10._]
Now suppose the observer wishes to view Mercury on some day, whereon
Mercury is an evening star. Take, for instance, June 9th, 1868. We
find from 'Dietrichsen' that on this day (at noon) Mercury's R.A.
is 6h. 53m.

23s.: and the sun's 5h. 11m. 31s. We need not trouble ourselves about
the odd hours after noon, and thus we have Mercury's R.A. greater
than the sun's by 1h. 41m. 52s.

Now we will suppose that the observer has so fixed his uprights and
the two rods, that the sun, seen from the fixed point of view, appears
to pass the point of crossing of the rods at half-past seven, then
Mercury will pass the cross-rod at 11m. 52s. past nine.

But where? To learn this we must take out Mercury's declination, which
is 24° 43' 18" N., and the sun's, which is 22° 59' 10" N.

The difference, 1° 44' 8" N. gives us Mercury's place, which it appears
is rather less than 1-3/4 degree north of the sun. Thus, about 1h.
42m.
after the sun has passed the cross-rod, Mercury will pass it between
the first and second divisions above the point of fastening. The sun
will have set about an hour, and Mercury will be easily found when the
telescope is directed towards the place indicated.

It will be noticed that this method does not require the time to
be exactly known.

All we have to do is to note the moment at which the sun passes the
point of fastening of the two rods, and to take our 1h. 42m.
from that moment.

This method, it may be noticed in passing, may be applied to give
naked-eye observations of Mercury at proper seasons (given in the
almanac). By a little ingenuity it may be applied as well to morning
as to evening observations, the sun's passage of the cross-rod being
taken on one morning and Mercury's on the next, so many minutes
_before_ the hour of the first observation.

In this way several views of Mercury may be obtained during the year.

Such methods may appear very insignificant to the systematic
observer with the equatorial, but that they are effective I can assert
from my own experience. Similar methods may be applied to determine
from the position of a known object, that of any neighbouring
unknown object even at night.

The cross-rod must be shifted (or else two cross-rods used) when the
unknown _precedes_ the known object. If two cross-rods are used, account
must be taken of the gradual diminution in the length of a degree
of right ascension as we leave the equator.

Even simpler methods carefully applied may serve to give a view of
Mercury. To show this, I may describe how I obtained my first view
of this planet. On June 1st, 1863, I noticed, that at five minutes
past seven the sun, as seen from my study window, appeared from
behind the gable-end of Mr. St.

Aubyn's house at Stoke, Devon. I estimated the effect of
Mercury's northerly declination (different of course for a vertical
wall, than for the cross-rod in fig. 8, which, in fact, agrees
with a declination-circle), and found that he would pass out opposite
a particular point of the wall a certain time after the sun.

I then turned the telescope towards that point, and focussed for
distinct vision of distant objects, so that the outline of the
house was seen out of focus.
As the calculated time of apparition approached, I moved the telescope
up and down so that the field swept the neighbourhood of the
estimated point of apparition.

I need hardly say that Mercury did not appear exactly at the assigned
point, nor did I see him make his first appearance; but I picked him
up so soon after emergence that the outline of the house was in the
field of view with him. He appeared as a half-disc.

I followed him with the telescope until the sun had set, and soon
after I was able to see him very distinctly with the naked eye. He shone
with a peculiar brilliance on the still bright sky; but
although perfectly distinct to the view when his place was indicated,
he escaped detection by the undirected eye.[12]
Mercury does not present any features of great interest in ordinary
telescopes; though he usually appears better defined than Venus,
at least as the latter is seen on a dark sky.

The phases are pleasingly seen (as shown in Plate 6) with a telescope
of moderate power.

For their proper observation, however, the planet must be looked
for with the telescope in the manner above indicated, as he always
shows a nearly semi-circular disc when he is visible to the naked
eye.

We come next to Venus, the most splendid of all the planets to the
eye.

In the telescope Venus disappoints the observer, however.
"This won't do, my girl," he was saying, and his tone and manner
of address seemed in some subtle fashion to strip all semblance of
dignity from the girl and leave her simply a "case" of the doctor's,
of a type only too familiar to him.

"It _won't_ do," he repeated. "You are simply shamming this delirium,
and you are lessening your chances for life every minute you persist
in it. I'm sorry to be hard on you, but I'm going to give you an
ultimatum right now. Either you will release Mrs. Graham from her
promise at once and quit this nonsense, or I shall call an officer,
report the truth of this occurrence, and you will be arrested not only
upon a charge of attempted suicide, but of attempted murder.

"Of course, you will then be removed to the jail hospital, where I am
afraid you may not enjoy the skilful care you are getting now. And,
if you live, the after effects of these charges will be exceedingly
unpleasant for you."

My heart almost stopped beating as I listened to the physician's
relentless words.

Suppose Dr. Pettit was mistaken and the girl should be really
delirious, after all. But just as I had reached the point of torturing
doubt hardly to be borne, the girl stopped her delirious muttering,
opened her eyes and looted steadily up at the physician.

"You devil," she said, at last, with quiet malignity. "You've called
the turn. I throw up my hands."

"I thought so." This was the physician's only response. He stood
quietly waiting while the girl gazed steadily, unwinkingly at him.

"Tell me," she said at last, coolly, "am I going to die?"

"I do not know," the physician returned, as coolly. "You have a slight
temperature, and I am afraid infection has developed. But I can tell
you that your performance of the last hour or two has not helped your
chances any. You must be perfectly quiet and obedient, conserve every
bit of strength if you wish to live."

"How about that very chivalric threat you made just now," the girl
retorted, sneeringly. "If I live, are you going to have me arrested
for this thing?"

"Not if you behave yourself and promise to make no more trouble," the
physician replied gravely.

There was another long silence. The girl lay with eyes closed. The
physician stood watching her keenly. Presently she opened her eyes
again.

"Call Mrs. It whitethorn be note that the activity of a telescope frequently

LONDON: PRINTED BY W. CLOWES AND SONS, DUKE STREET, STAMFORD
alley, AND CHARING CROSS.
By the time the day came when Harry and Lillian left us to go back
to their apartment the elder Mrs. Graham had so far gotten over
her prejudices as to bid Lillian a reluctant farewell and express a
sincere wish that she might soon see her again.

Toward Harry Underwood my mother-in-law's demeanor remained rigid.
She treated him with formal, icy politeness which irritated Dicky, but
appeared greatly to amuse Mr. Underwood. He took delight in paying her
the most elaborate attentions, laying fresh nosegays of flowers at
her plate at each meal. If he had been a lover besieging a beautiful
girl's heart he could not have been more attentive, while he was
absolutely impervious to all the chilling rebuffs she gave him.

I think that the touch of malice which is always a part of this man's
humor was gratified by the frigid annoyance which the elder Mrs.
Graham exhibited toward his attentions. At any rate, he kept them up
until the very hour of his departure.

It was when he happened to be alone with me on the veranda a few
moments before the coming of the taxi which was to bear them to their
homeward train that he gave me the real explanation of his conduct.

"Tell me, loveliest lady," he said, with the touch of exaggeration
which his manner always holds toward me, "tell me, haven't I squared
up part of your account with the old girl this last week?"

"Why, what do you mean?" I stammered.

"Don't pretend such innocence," he retorted. Very few, however, seem
to care greatly whether they are comfortable or no.
There are some men so ignorant and careless of what gives them pleasure
that they cannot be said ever to have been really born as living
beings at all.

They present some of the phenomena of having been born--they
reproduce, in fact, so many of the ideas which we associate with
having been born that it is hard not to think of them as living
beings--but in spite of all appearances the central idea is wanting.

At least one half of the misery which meets us daily might be removed
or, at any rate, greatly alleviated, if those who suffer by it would
think it worth their while to be at any pains to get rid of it. That
they do not so think is proof that they neither know, nor care to
know, more than in a very languid way, what it is that will relieve
them most effectually or, in other words, that the shoe does not
really pinch them so hard as we think it does.

For when it really pinches, as when a man is being flogged, he will
seek relief by any means in his power. So my great namesake said, "Surely
the pleasure is as great Of being cheated as to cheat"; and so, again,
I remember to have seen a poem many years ago in Punch according to
which a certain young lady, being discontented at home, went out
into the world in quest to "Some burden make or burden bear, But
which she did not greatly care--Oh Miseree!"

So long as there was discomfort somewhere it was all right.

To those, however, who are desirous of knowing what gives them
pleasure but do not quite know how to set about it I have no better
advice to give than that they must take the same pains about acquiring
this difficult art as about any other, and must acquire it in the
same way--that is by attending to one thing at a time and not being
in too great a hurry.

Proficiency is not to be attained here, any more than elsewhere, by
short cuts or by getting other people to do work that no other
than oneself can do.

Above all things it is necessary here, as in all other branches
of study, not to think we know a thing before we do know it--to make
sure of our ground and be quite certain that we really do like a thing
before we say we do.

When you cannot decide whether you like a thing or not, nothing is
easier than to say so and to hang it up among the uncertainties.

Or when you know you do not know and are in such doubt as to see no
chance of deciding, then you may take one side or the other provisionally
and throw yourself into it. This will sometimes make you uncomfortable,
and you will feel you have taken the wrong side and thus learn
that the other was the right one.

Sometimes you will feel you have done right. Any way ere long you will
know more about it. But there must have been a secret treaty with
yourself to the effect that the decision was provisional only.

For, after all, the most important first principle in this matter
is the not lightly thinking you know what you like till you have made
sure of your ground.

I was nearly forty before I felt how stupid it was to pretend to
know things that I did not know and I still often catch myself
doing so.

Not one of my school-masters taught me this, but altogether otherwise.

ii
I should like to like Schumann's music better than I do; I dare say I
could make myself like it better if I tried; but I do not like
having to try to make myself like things; I like things that make
me like them at once and no trying at all.

iii
To know whether you are enjoying a piece of music or not you must
see whether you find yourself looking at the advertisements of Pear's
soap at the end of the programme.

De Minimis non Curat Lex

i
Yes, but what is a minimum? Sometimes a maximum is a minimum, and
sometimes the other way about. If you know you know, and if you don't
you don't.

ii
Yes, but what is a minimum?

So increased material weight involves increased moral weight, but
where does there begin to be any weight at all?

There is a miracle somewhere. At the point where two very large
nothings have united to form a very little something.

iii
There is no such complete assimilation as assimilation of rhythm. In
fact it is in assimilation of rhythm that what we see as assimilation
consists.

When two liquid bodies come together with nearly the same rhythms,
as, say, two tumblers of water, differing but very slightly, the
two assimilate rapidly--becoming homogeneous throughout.

So with wine and water which assimilate, or at any rate form a new
homogeneous substance, very rapidly. Not so with oil and water.
Still, I should like to know whether it would not be possible to have
so much water and so little oil that the water would in time absorb
the oil.

I have not thought about it, but it seems as though the maxim de
minimis non curat lex--the fact that a wrong, a contradiction in
terms, a violation of all our ordinary canons does not matter and
should be brushed aside--it seems as though this maxim went very
low down in the scale of nature, as though it were the one principle
rendering combination (integration) and, I suppose, dissolution
(disintegration) also, possible.

For combination of any kind involves contradiction in terms; it
involves a self-stultification on the part of one or more things, more
or less complete in both of them.

For one or both cease to be, and to cease to be is to contradict all
one's fundamental axioms or terms.

And this is always going on in the mental world as much as in the
material; everything is always changing and stultifying itself
more or less completely.

There is no permanence of identity so absolute, either in the
physical world, or in our conception of the word "identity," that it
is not crossed with the notion of perpetual change which, pro tanto,
destroys identity. Perfect, absolute identity is like perfect, absolute
anything--as near an approach to nothing, or nonsense, as our minds
can grasp. It is, then, in the essence of our conception of identity
that nothing should maintain a perfect identity; there is an element
of disintegration in the only conception of integration that we
can form.

What is it, then, that makes this conflict not only possible and
bearable but even pleasant? What is it that so oils the machinery of
our thoughts that things which would otherwise cause intolerable
friction and heat produce no jar?

Surely it is the principle that a very overwhelming majority rides
rough-shod with impunity over a very small minority; that a drop of
brandy in a gallon of water is practically no brandy; that a dozen
maniacs among a hundred thousand people produce no unsettling effect
upon our minds; that a well-written i will go as an i even though
the dot be omitted--it seems to me that it is this principle, which
is embodied in de minimis non curat lex, that makes it possible
that there should be majora and a lex to care about them.

This is saying in another form that association does not stick to
the letter of its bond.

Saints

Saints are always grumbling because the world will not take them at
their own estimate; so they cry out upon this place and upon that,
saying it does not know the things belonging to its peace and that
it will be too late soon and that people will be very sorry then that
they did not make more of the grumbler, whoever he may be, inasmuch
as he will make it hot for them and pay them out generally.

All this means: "Put me in a better social and financial position
than I now occupy; give me more of the good things of this life,
if not actual money yet authority (which is better loved by most men
than even money itself), to reward me because I am to have such an
extraordinary good fortune and high position in the world which is
to come."
When their contemporaries do not see this and tell them that they cannot
expect to have it both ways, they lose their tempers, shake the
dust from their feet and go sulking off into the wilderness.

This is as regards themselves; to their followers they say: "You must
not expect to be able to make the best of both worlds. The thing is
absurd; it cannot be done. You must choose which you prefer, go in for
it and leave the other, for you cannot have both."

When a saint complains that people do not know the things
belonging to their peace, what he really means is that they do not
sufficiently care about the things belonging to his own peace.

Prayer

i
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may
be certified how long I have to live (Ps. xxxix. 5).

Of all prayers this is the insanest. That the one who uttered it
should have made and retained a reputation is a strong argument in
favour of his having been surrounded with courtiers. "Lord, let me not
know mine end" would be better, only it would be praying for what
God has already granted us.

"Lord, let me know A.B.'s end" would be bad enough. Even though A.B.
were Mr. Gladstone--we might hear he was not to die yet. "Lord, stop
A.B. from knowing my end" would be reasonable, if there were any use
in praying that A.B. might not be able to do what he never can
do. Or can the prayer refer to the other end of life? "Lord, let me
know my beginning." This again would not be always prudent.

The prayer is a silly piece of petulance and it would have served
the maker of it right to have had it granted.

"A painful and lingering disease followed by death" or "Ninety, a burden
to yourself and every one else"--there is not so much to pick and
choose between them.
Surely, "I thank thee, O Lord, that thou hast hidden mine end from
me" would be better. The sting of death is in foreknowledge of the
when and the how.

If again he had prayed that he might be able to make his psalms a
little more lively, and be saved from becoming the bore which he
has been to so many generations of sick persons and young children--or
that he might find a publisher for them with greater facility--but
there is no end to it.

The prayer he did pray was about the worst he could have prayed and the
psalmist, being the psalmist, naturally prayed it--unless I have
misquoted him.

ii

Prayers are to men as dolls are to children. They are not without use
and comfort, but it is not easy to take them very seriously. I dropped
saying mine suddenly once for all without malice prepense, on the
night of the 29th of September, 1859, when I went on board the Roman
Emperor to sail for New Zealand. I had said them the night before and
doubted not that I was always going to say them as I always had
done hitherto.

That night, I suppose, the sense of change was so great that it shook
them quietly off.

I was not then a sceptic; I had got as far as disbelief in infant
baptism but no further.

I felt no compunction of conscience, however, about leaving off my
morning and evening prayers--simply I could no longer say them.

iii
Lead us not into temptation (Matt. vi. 13).

For example; I am crossing from Calais to Dover and there is a well-
known popular preacher on board, say Archdeacon Farrar.

I have my camera in my hand and though the sea is rough the sun is
brilliant. I see the archdeacon come on board at Calais and seat
himself upon the upper deck, looking as though he had just stepped
out of a band-box.

Can I be expected to resist the temptation of snapping him?

Suppose that in the train for an hour before reaching Calais I had
said any number of times, "Lead us not into temptation," is it
likely that the archdeacon would have been made to take some other
boat or to stay in Calais, or that I myself, by being delayed on
my homeward journey, should have been led into some other temptation,
though perhaps smaller?

Had I not better snap him and have done with it? Is there enough chance
of good result to make it worth while to try the experiment?

The general consensus of opinion is that there is not.

And as for praying for strength to resist temptation--granted that
if, when I saw the archdeacon in the band-box stage, I had immediately
prayed for strength I might have been enabled to put the evil thing
from me for a time, how long would this have been likely to last
when I saw his face grow saintlier and saintlier?

I am an excellent sailor myself, but he is not, and when I see him
there, his eyes closed and his head thrown back, like a sleeping St.
Joseph in a shovel hat, with a basin beside him, can I expect
to be saved from snapping him by such a formula as "Deliver us from
evil"?

Is it in photographer's nature to do so? When David found himself in
the cave with Saul he cut off one of Saul's coattails; if he had
had a camera and there had been enough light he would have photographed
him; but would it have been in flesh and blood for him neither to
cut off his coat-tail nor to snap him?

There is a photographer in every bush, going about like a roaring lion
seeking whom he may devour.

iv
Teach me to live that I may dread The grave as little as my bed.

This is from the evening hymn which all respectable children are taught.
It sounds well, but it is immoral.

Our own death is a premium which we must pay for the far greater benefit
we have derived from the fact that so many people have not only lived
but also died before us. For if the old ones had not in course of time
gone there would have been no progress; all our civilisation is
due to the arrangement whereby no man shall live for ever, and to
this huge mass of advantage we must each contribute our mite; that
is to say, when our turn comes we too must die.

The hardship is that interested persons should be able to scare us
into thinking the change we call death to be the desperate business
which they make it out to be. There is no hardship in having to suffer
that change.

Bishop Ken, however, goes too far. Undesirable, of course, death
must always be to those who are fairly well off, but it is undesirable
that any living being should live in habitual indifference to death.

The indifference should be kept for worthy occasions, and even
then, though death be gladly faced, it is not healthy that it
should be faced as though it were a mere undressing and going to
bed.

XIV--HIGGLEDY-PIGGLEDY

Preface to Vol. II

On indexing this volume, as with Vols. I and IV which are already
indexed and as, no doubt, will be the case with any that I may
live to index later, I am alarmed at the triviality of many of these
notes, the ineptitude of many and the obvious untenableness of many
that I should have done much better to destroy.

Elmsley, in one of his letters to Dr. Butler, says that an author is
the worst person to put one of his own works through the press
(Life of Dr.

Butler, I, 88).

It seems to me that he is the worst person also to make selections from
his own notes or indeed even, in my case, to write them.

I cannot help it. They grew as, with little disturbance,
they now stand; they are not meant for publication; the bad ones
serve as bread for the jam of the good ones; it was less trouble to
let them go than to think whether they ought not to be destroyed.

The retort, however, is obvious; no thinking should have been required
in respect of many--a glance should have consigned them to the
waste-paper basket.

I know it and I know that many a one of those who look over these
books--for that they will be looked over by not a few I doubt
not--will think me to have been a greater fool than I probably was.

I cannot help it.
"Well, mother, what do you want to eat?" Dicky began genially, when an
obsequious waiter had seated us and put the menu cards before us.

"Please do not consider me in the least," my mother-in-law said with
her most Christian-martyr-like expression. "Whatever you and Margaret
wish will do very well for me."

Dicky turned from his mother with a little impatient shrug.

"What about you, Madge?" he asked.

"Chicken a la Maryland in a chafing dish and a combination salad with
that anchovy and sherry dressing you make so deliciously," I replied
promptly. "The rest of the dinner I'll leave to you."

My mother-in-law glared at me.

"It strikes me there isn't much left to leave to him after an order of
that kind," she said, tartly.

"You haven't eaten many of Dicky's dinners then," I said audaciously,
with a little moue at him. "He orders the most perfect dinners of any
one I know."

"Of course, with your wide experience, you ought to be a critical
judge of his ability," my mother-in-law snapped back.

Her tone was even more insulting than her words. It tipped with
cruel venom her allusion to the quiet, almost cloistered life of my
girlhood.

I drew a long breath as I saw my mother-in-law adjust her lorgnette
and proceed to gaze through it with critical hauteur at the other
diners. I hoped that her curiosity and interest in the things going on
around her would make her forget her imaginary grievances, but my hope
was destined to be short lived.

It was while we were discussing our oysters, the very first offered of
the season, that she spoke to me, suddenly, abruptly:

"Margaret, do you know that man at the second table back of us? He
hasn't taken his eyes from you for the last ten minutes."

My heart almost stopped beating, for my intuition told me at once the
identity of the gazer. It must be the man whose uncanny, mournful look
had so distressed me when I was waiting for Lillian Underwood in the
little reception room at the Sydenham the preceding Monday, the man
who had followed us to the little tea room, who had even taken the
same train to Marvin with me.

I felt as if I could not lift my eyes to look at the man my
mother-in-law indicated, and yet I knew I must glance casually at
him if I were to avert the displeased suspicion which I already saw
creeping into her eyes.

When my eyes met his he gave not the slightest sign that he knew I was
looking at him, simply continued his steady gaze, which had something
of wistful mournfulness in it. I averted my eyes as quickly as
possible, and tried to look absolutely unconcerned.

"I am sure he cannot be looking at me," I said, lightly. "I do not
know him at all."

I hoped that my mother-in-law would not notice my evasion, but she was
too quick for me.

"You may not know him, but have you ever seen him before?" she asked,
shrewdly.

"Really, mother," Dicky interposed, his face darkening, "you're going
a little too far with that catechism. Madge says she doesn't know the
man, that settles it. By the way, Madge, is he annoying you? If he is,
I can settle him in about two seconds."

"Oh, no," I said nervously, "I don't think the man's really looking at
me at all; he's simply gazing out into space, thinking, and happens
to be facing this way. It would be supremely ridiculous to call him to
account for it."

My mother-in-law snorted, but made no further comment, evidently
silenced by Dicky's reproof.

I may have imagined it, but it seemed to me that Dicky looked at me
a little curiously when I protested my belief that the man was simply
absorbed in thought and not looking at me at all.

When we were dallying with the curiously moulded ices which Dicky had
ordered for dessert, I saw his eyes light up as he caught sight of
some one he evidently knew.

"Pardon me just a minute, will you?" he said, turning to his mother
and me, apologetically, "I see Bob Simonds over there with a bunch of
fellows. Haven't seen him in a coon's age. He's been over across the
pond in the big mixup. Didn't know he was back. I don't want any more
of this ice, anyway, and when the waiter comes, order cheese, coffee
and a cordial for us all."

He was gone in another instant, making his way with the swift,
debonair grace which is always a part of Dicky, to the group of men at
a table not far from ours, who welcomed him joyously.

My mother-in-law's eyes followed mine, and I knew that for once, at
least, we were of one mind, and that mind was full of pride in the man
so dear to, us both. He was easily the most distinguished figure at
the table full of men who greeted him so joyously. I knew that his
mother noted with me how cordial was the welcome each man gave Dicky,
how they all seemed to defer to him and hang upon his words.

Then across my vision came a picture most terrifying to me. It was
as if my mother-in-law and I were spectators of a series of motion
picture films. Toward the table, where Dicky stood surrounded by his
friends, there sauntered the mysterious stranger, who had attracted my
mother-in-law's attention by his scrutiny of me.

But he was no stranger to the men surrounding Dicky. Most of them
greeted him warmly. Of course, I was too far away to hear what was
said, but I saw the pantomime in which he requested an introduction to
Dicky of one of his friends!

Then I saw the stranger meet Dicky and engage him in earnest
conversation. I did not dare to look at my mother-in-law. I knew she
was gazing in open-mouthed wonder at her son, but I hoped she did not
know the queer mixture of terror and interest with which I watched the
picture at the other table.

For it was no surprise to me when, a few minutes later, Dicky came
back toward our table. With him, talking earnestly, as if he had been
a childhood friend, walked the mysterious stranger. I told myself that
I had known it would be so from the first.

From the moment I had first seen this man's haunting eyes gazing at me
in the reception room of the Sydenham I had felt that a meeting with
him was inevitable. How or where he would touch my life I did not
know, but that he was destined to wield some influence, sinister or
favorable, over me, I was sure, and I trembled with vague terror as I
saw him drawing near.

"Mother, may I present Mr. Gordon? My wife, Mr. Gordon."

Dicky's manner was nervous, preoccupied, as he spoke. His mother's
face showed very plainly her resentment at being obliged to meet the
man upon whose steady staring at me she had so acidly commented a few
minutes before.

For my own part, I was so upset that I felt actually ill, as the eyes
of the persistent stranger met mine. How had this man, who had so
terrified me by his persistent pursuit and scrutiny, managed to obtain
an introduction to Dicky?

Dicky made a place for the man near me, and signalled the waiter.

"I know you have dined," he said, courteously, "but you'll at least
have coffee and a cordial with us, will you not?"

"Thank you," Mr. Gordon said, in a deep, rich voice, "I have not yet
had coffee. If you will be so kind, I should like a little apricot
brandy instead of a cordial."

Dicky gave the necessary order to the waiter, and we all sat back in
our chairs.

I, for one, felt as though I were a spectator at a play, waiting for
the curtain to run up upon some thrilling episode. For the few minutes
while we waited for our coffee, Dicky had to carry the burden of the
conversation. His mother, with her lips pressed together in a tight,
thin line, evidently had resolved to take no part in any conversation
with the stranger. I was really too terrified to say anything, and,
besides the briefest of assents to Dicky's observations, the stranger
said nothing.

There was something about the man's whole personality that both
attracted and repelled me. With one breath I felt that I had a curious
sense of liking and admiration for him, and was proud of the interest
in me, which he had taken no pains to conceal. The next moment a real
terror and dislike of him swept over me.

I waited with beating heart for him to finish his coffee. It seemed
to me that I could hardly wait for him to speak. For I had a psychic
presentiment that before he left the table he would make known to us
the reason for his rude pursuit of me.

His first words confirmed my impression:

"I am afraid, Mrs. Graham," he said, courteously, turning to me, as
he finished his coffee, "that I have startled and alarmed you by my
endeavor to ascertain your identity."

I did not answer him. I did not wish to tell him that I had been
frightened; neither could I truthfully deny his assertion. And I
wished that I had not evaded my mother-in-law's query concerning him.

He did not appear to heed my silence however, but went on rapidly:

"It is a very simple matter, after all," he said. "You see, you
resemble so closely a very dear friend of my youth, in fact, the
dearest I ever had, that when I caught sight of you the other day
in the reception room of the Sydenham, it seemed as if her very self
stood before me."

There was a vibrant, haunting note in his voice that told me, better
than words, that, whoever this woman of his youth might have been, her
memory was something far more to him than of a mere friend.

"I could not rest until I found out your identity, and secured an
introduction to you," he went on. "You will not be offended if I ask
you one or two rather personal questions, will you?"

"Indeed, no," I returned mechanically.

Mr. Gordon hesitated. His suave self-possession seemed to have
deserted him. He swallowed hard twice, and then asked, nervously:

"May I ask your name before you were married, Mrs. Graham?"

"Margaret Spencer," I returned steadily.

There was a cry of astonishment from Dicky. Mr. Gordon had reeled in
his chair as if he were about to faint, then, with closed eyes and
white lips, he sat motionless, gripping the table as if for support.

"Do not be alarmed--I am all right--only a momentary faintness, I
assure you."

Mr. Gordon opened his eyes and smiled at us wanly.

I knew that Dicky was as much relieved as I at our guest's return
to self-command. That he was resentful as well as mystified at the
singular behavior of Mr. Gordon I also gleaned from his darkened face,
and a little steely glint in his eyes.

"I hope that you will forgive me," Mr. Gordon went on, and his rich
voice was so filled with regret and humility that I felt my heart
soften toward him.

"I trust you have not gained the impression that my momentary
faintness had anything to do with your name," he said. "My attack at
that time was merely a coincidence. I am subject to these spells of
faintness. I hope this one did not alarm you."

He looked at me directly, as if expecting an answer.

"I am not easily alarmed," I returned, trying hard to keep out of my
voice anything save the indifferent courtesy which one would bestow
upon a stranger, for the atmosphere of mystery seemed deepening about
this stranger and me. I did not believe he had spoken the truth,
when he said that my utterance of my maiden name, in response to his
question, had nothing to do with his faintness. I was as certain as I
was of anything that it was the utterance of that name, the revelation
of my identity thus made to him, that caused his emotion. But the
astronomer's object is to get rid of all these flames and sprays
of coloured light, so that he has very little sympathy with the
admiration which Wordsworth is said to have expressed for out-of-focus
views of the stars.

We pass to more legitimate observations, noticing in passing that Sirius
is a double star, the companion being of the tenth magnitude, and
distant about ten seconds from the primary.

But our beginner is not likely to see the companion, which is a
very difficult object, vowing to the overpowering brilliancy of
the primary.

Orion affords the observer a splendid field of research. It is a
constellation rich in double and multiple stars, clusters, and
nebulæ.

We will begin with an easy object.

The star [delta] (Plate 3), or _Mintaka_, the uppermost of the three
stars forming the belt, is a wide double.

The primary is of the second magnitude, the secondary of the seventh,
both being white.

The star [alpha] (_Betelgeuse_) is an interesting object, on account
of its colour and brilliance, and as one of the most remarkable variables
in the heavens.

It was first observed to be variable by Sir John Herschel in
1836. At this period its variations were "most marked and striking."
This continued until 1840, when the changes became "much less
conspicuous.

In January, 1849, they had recommenced, and on December 5th, 1852,
Mr. Fletcher observed [alpha] Orionis brighter than Capella, and actually
the largest star in the northern hemisphere." That a star so conspicuous,
and presumably so large, should present such remarkable variations,
is a circumstance which adds an additional interest to the results
which have rewarded the spectrum-analysis of this star by Mr.

Huggins and Professor Miller. It appears that there is decisive evidence
of the presence in this luminary of many elements known to exist
in our own sun; amongst others are found sodium, magnesium, calcium,
iron, and bismuth.

Hydrogen appears to be absent, or, more correctly, there are no lines
in the star's spectrum corresponding to those of hydrogen in the solar
spectrum.

Secchi considers that there is evidence of an actual change in the
spectrum of the star, an opinion in which Mr. Huggins does not coincide.
In the telescope Betelgeuse appears as "a rich and brilliant gem,"
says Lassell, "a rich topaz, in hue and brilliancy differing from
any that I have seen."

Turn next to [beta] (Rigel), the brightest star below the belt.
This is a very noted double, and will severely test our observer's
telescope, if small. The components are well separated (see Plate 3),
compared with many easier doubles; the secondary is also of the seventh
magnitude, so that neither as respects closeness nor smallness
of the secondary, is Rigel a difficult object.

It is the combination of the two features which makes it a test-object.
Kitchener says a 1-3/4-inch object-glass should show Rigel double;
in earlier editions of his work he gave 2-3/4-inches as the necessary
aperture. Smyth mentions Rigel as a test for a 4-inch aperture,
with powers of from 80 to 120. A 3-inch aperture, however, will certainly
show the companion. Rigel is an orange star, the companion blue.

Turn next to [lambda] the northernmost of the set of three stars in
the head of Orion. This is a triple star, though an aperture of 3
inches will show it only as a double.

The components are 5" apart, the colours pale white and violet. With
the full powers of a 3-1/2-inch glass a faint companion may be seen
above [lambda].

The star [zeta], the lowest in the belt, may be tried with a
3-1/2-inch glass.

It is a close double, the components being nearly equal, and about
2-1/2" apart (see Plate 3).

For a change we will now try our telescope on a nebula, selecting the
great nebula in the Sword. The place of this object is indicated in
Plate 2. There can be no difficulty in finding it since it is clearly
visible to the naked eye on a moonless night--the only sort of night
on which an observer would care to look at nebulæ.

A low power should be employed.

The nebula is shown in Plate 3 as I have seen it with a 3-inch
aperture.

We see nothing of those complex streams of light which are portrayed
in the drawings of Herschel, Bond, and Lassell, but enough to excite
our interest and wonder.

What is this marvellous light-cloud?

One could almost imagine that there was a strange prophetic meaning in
the words which have been translated "Canst thou loose the bands
of Orion?" Telescope after telescope had been turned on this
wonderful object with the hope of resolving its light into stars. But
it proved intractable to Herschel's great reflector, to Lassell's
2-feet reflector, to Lord Rosse's 3-feet reflector, and even partially
to the great 6-feet reflector.

Then we hear of its supposed resolution into stars, Lord Rosse himself
writing to Professor Nichol, in 1846, "I may safely say there can
be little, if any, doubt as to the resolvability of the nebula;--all
about the trapezium is a mass of stars, the rest of the nebula also
abounding with stars, and exhibiting the characteristics of
resolvability strongly marked."

It was decided, therefore, that assuredly the great nebula is a
congeries of stars, and not a mass of nebulous matter as had been
surmised by Sir W. Herschel. And therefore astronomers were not a
little surprised when it was proved by Mr. Huggins' spectrum-analysis
that the nebula consists of gaseous matter. How widely extended this
gaseous universe may be we cannot say.

The general opinion is that the nebulæ
are removed far beyond the fixed stars. If this were so, the dimensions
of the Orion nebula would be indeed enormous, far larger probably
than those of the whole system whereof our sun is a member.

I believe this view is founded on insufficient evidence, but this
would not be the place to discuss the subject. I shall merely point
out that the nebula occurs in a region rich in stars, and if it
is not, like the great nebula in Argo, clustered around a remarkable
star, it is found associated in a manner which I cannot look upon
as accidental with a set of small-magnitude stars, and notably with
the trapezium which surrounds that very remarkable black gap within
the nebula.

The fact that the nebula shares the proper motion of the trapezium
appears inexplicable if the nebula is really far out in space beyond
the trapezium.

A very small proper motion of the trapezium (alone) would long since
have destroyed the remarkable agreement in the position of the dark
gap and the trapezium which has been noticed for so many years.

But whether belonging to our system or far beyond it, the great
nebula must have enormous dimensions.

A vast gaseous system it is, sustained by what arrangements or forces
we cannot tell, nor can we know what purposes it subserves. Mr.
Huggins' discovery that comets have gaseous nuclei, (so far as the
two he has yet examined show) may suggest the speculation that in
the Orion nebula we see a vast system of comets travelling in extensive
orbits around nuclear stars, and so slowly as to exhibit for long
intervals of time an unchanged figure. "But of such speculations" we
may say with Sir J. Herschel "there is no end."
To return to our telescopic observations:--The trapezium affords a
useful test for the light-gathering power of the telescope.

Large instruments exhibit nine stars.

But our observer may be well satisfied with his instrument and his
eye-sight if he can see five with a 3-1/2-inch aperture.[3] A good
3-inch glass shows four distinctly.

But with smaller apertures only three are visible.

The whole neighbourhood of the great nebula will well repay research.

The observer may sweep over it carefully on any dark night with
profit.
Above the nebula is the star-cluster 362 H. The star [iota] (double as
shown in Plate 3) below the nebula is involved in a strong
nebulosity.

And in searching over this region we meet with delicate double,
triple, and multiple stars, which make the survey interesting with
almost any power that may be applied.

Above the nebula is the star [sigma], a multiple star. To an observer
with a good 3-1/2-inch glass [sigma] appears as an octuple star.
It is well seen, however, as a fine multiple star with a smaller
aperture.

Some of the stars of this group appear to be variable.

The star [rho] Orionis is an unequal, easy double, the components
being separated by nearly seven seconds.

The primary is orange, the smaller star smalt-blue (see Plate 3).

The middle star of the belt ([epsilon]) has a distant blue companion.

This star, like [iota], is nebulous.

In fact, the whole region within the triangle formed by stars [gamma],
[kappa] and [beta] is full of nebulous double and multiple stars, whose
aggregation in this region I do not consider wholly accidental.

We have not explored half the wealth of Orion, but leave much for
future observation. We must turn, however, to other constellations.

Below Orion is Lepus, the Hare, a small constellation containing some
remarkable doubles. Among these we may note [xi], a white star with a
scarlet companion; [gamma], a yellow and garnet double; and [iota],
a double star, white and pale violet, with a distant red companion.

The star [kappa] Leporis is a rather close double, white with a small
green companion.

The intensely red star R Leporis (a variable) will be found in the
position indicated in the map.

Still keeping within the boundary of our map, we may next turn
to the fine cluster 2 H (vii.) in Monoceros. This cluster is visible
to the naked eye, and will be easily found. The nebula 2 H (iv.)
is a remarkable one with a powerful telescope.

The star 11 Monocerotis is a fine triple star described by the elder
Herschel as one of the finest sights in the heavens.

Our observer, however, will see it as a double (see Plate 3).
[delta] Monocerotis is an easy double, yellow and lavender.

We may now leave the region covered by the map and take a survey of the
heavens for some objects well seen at this season.

Towards the south-east, high up above the horizon, we see the twin-stars
Castor and Pollux. The upper is Castor, the finest double star
visible in the northern heavens. The components are nearly equal and
rather more than 5" apart (see Plate 3).

Both are white according to the best observers, but the smaller is thought
by some to be slightly greenish.

Pollux is a coarse but fine triple star (in large instruments multiple).

The components orange, grey, and lilac.

There are many other fine objects in Gemini, but we pass to Cancer.

The fine cluster Præsepe in Cancer may easily be found as it is distinctly
visible to the naked eye in the position shown in Plate 1, Map I.

In the telescope it is seen as shown in Plate 3.

The star [iota] Cancri is a wide double, the colours orange and
blue.

Procyon, the first-magnitude star between Præsepe and Sirius, is finely
coloured--yellow with a distant orange companion, which appears to
be variable.

Below the Twins, almost in a line with them, is the star [alpha] Hydræ,
called Al Fard, or "the Solitary One." It is a 2nd magnitude variable.
I mention it, however, not on its own account, but as a guide to
the fine double [epsilon] Hydræ.

This star is the middle one of a group of three, lying between Pollux
and Al Fard rather nearer the latter.

The components of [epsilon] Hydræ are separated by about 3-1/2" (see
Plate 3). The primary is of the fourth, the companion of the eighth
magnitude; the former is yellow, the latter a ruddy purple.

The period of [epsilon] Hydræ is about 450 years.

The constellation Leo Minor, now due east and about midway between
the horizon and the zenith, is well worth sweeping over. It contains
several fine fields.

Let us next turn to the western heavens. Here there are some noteworthy
objects.

To begin with, there are the Pleiades, showing to the naked eye only
six or seven stars. In the telescope the Pleiades appear as shown
in Plate 3.

The Hyades also show some fine fields with low powers.

Aldebaran, the principal star of the Hyades, as also of the constellation
Taurus, is a noted red star. It is chiefly remarkable for the
close spectroscopic analysis to which it has been subjected by
Messrs.

Huggins and Miller. Unlike Betelgeuse, the spectrum of Aldebaran exhibits
the lines corresponding to hydrogen, and no less than eight
metals--sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, bismuth, tellurium,
antimony, and mercury, are proved to exist in the constitution of
this brilliant red star.

On the right of Aldebaran, in the position indicated in Plate 1, Map I.,
are the stars [zeta] and [beta] Tauri. If with a low power the observer
sweep from [zeta] towards [beta], he will soon find--not far from
[zeta] (at a distance of about one-sixth of the distance separating
[beta] from [zeta]), the celebrated Crab nebula, known as 1 M. This
was the first nebula discovered by Messier, and its discovery led to
the formation of his catalogue of 103 nebulæ. In a small telescope
this object appears as a nebulous light of oval form, no traces being
seen of the wisps and sprays of light presented in Lord Rosse's well
known picture of the nebula.

Here I shall conclude the labours of our first half-hour among the
stars, noticing that the examination of Plate 1 will show what other
constellations besides those here considered are well situated for
observation at this season. It will be remarked that many
constellations well seen in the third half-hour (Chapter IV.) are
favourably seen in the first also, and _vice versâ_.

For instance, the constellation Ursa Major well-placed towards the
north-east in the first quarter of the year, is equally well-placed
towards the north-west in the third, and similarly of the constellation
Cassiopeia. The same relation connects the second and fourth
quarters of the year.

[Illustration: PLATE III.]

CHAPTER III.

A HALF-HOUR WITH LYRA, HERCULES, CORVUS, CRATER, ETC.

The observations now to be commenced are supposed to take place during
the second quarter of the year,--at ten o'clock on the 20th of April,
or at nine on the 5th of May, or at eight on the 21st of May, or at
seven on the 5th of June, or at hours intermediate to these on
intermediate days.

We again look first for the Great Bear, now near the zenith, and
thence find the Pole-star. Turning towards the north, we see
Cassiopeia between the Pole-star and the horizon. Towards the
north-west is the brilliant Capella, and towards the north-east the
equally brilliant Vega, beneath which, and somewhat northerly, is the
cross in Cygnus.

The Milky Way passes from the eastern horizon towards the north
(low down), and so round to the western horizon.

In selecting a region for special observation, we shall adopt a
different plan from that used in the preceding "half-hour."

The region on the equator and towards the south is indeed particularly
interesting, since it includes the nebular region in Virgo. Within
this space nebulæ
are clustered more closely than over any corresponding space in the
heavens, save only the greater Magellanic cloud.

But to the observer with telescopes of moderate power these nebulæ present
few features of special interest; and there are regions of the sky now
well situated for observation, which, at most other epochs are
either low down towards the horizon or inconveniently near to the
zenith.

We shall therefore select one of these, the region included in the
second map of Plate 2, and the neighbouring part of the celestial
sphere.

At any of the hours above named, the constellation Hercules lies towards
the east.

A quadrant taken from the zenith to the eastern horizon passes close
to the last star ([eta]) of the Great Bear's tail, through [beta], a
star in Bootes' head, near [beta] Herculis, between the two "Alphas"
which mark the heads of Hercules and Ophiuchus, and so past [beta]
Ophiuchi, a third-magnitude star near the horizon.

And here we may turn aside for a moment to notice the remarkable
vertical row of six conspicuous stars towards the east-south-east;
these are, counting them in order from the horizon, [zeta], [epsilon],
and [delta] Ophiuchi, [epsilon], [alpha], and [delta] Serpentis.

Let the telescope first be directed towards Vega. This orb presents
a brilliant appearance in the telescope. Its colour is a bluish-white.

In an ordinary telescope Vega appears as a single star, but with a large
object-glass two distant small companions are seen. A nine-inch glass
shows also two small companions within a few seconds of Vega. In
the great Harvard refractor Vega is seen with no less than thirty-five
companions. I imagine that all these stars, and others which can be
seen in neighbouring fields, indicate the association of Vega with
the neighbouring stream of the Milky Way.

Let our observer now direct his telescope to the star [epsilon]
Lyræ. Or rather, let him first closely examine this star with the
naked eye. The star is easily identified, since it lies to the left
of Vega, forming with [zeta] a small equilateral triangle. A careful
scrutiny suffices to indicate a peculiarity in this star. If our
observer possesses very good eye-sight, he will distinctly recognise
it as a "naked-eye double"; but more probably he will only notice
that it appears lengthened in a north and south direction.[4] In
the finder the star is easily divided.

Applying a low power to the telescope itself, we see [epsilon]
Lyræ as a wide double, the line joining the components lying nearly
north and south. The southernmost component (the upper in the figure)
is called [epsilon]^{1}, the other [epsilon]^{2}. Seen as a
double, both components appear white.

Now, if the observer's telescope is sufficiently powerful, each of
the components may be seen to be itself double. First try [epsilon]^{1},
the northern pair. The line joining the components is directed as shown
in Plate 3. The distance between them is 3"·2, their magnitudes 5
and 6-1/2, and their colours yellow and ruddy. If the observer succeeds
in seeing [epsilon]^{1} fairly divided, he will probably not fail
in detecting the duplicity of [epsilon]^{2}, though this is a
rather closer pair, the distance between the components being only
2"·6.

The magnitudes are 5 and 5-1/2, both being white.

Between [epsilon]^{1} and [epsilon]^{2} are three faint stars, possibly
forming with the quadruple a single system.

Let us next turn to the third star of the equilateral triangle mentioned
above--viz. to the star [zeta] Lyræ.

This is a splendid but easy double.
It is figured in Plate 3, but it must be noticed that the figure of
[zeta] and the other nine small figures are not drawn on the same scale
as [epsilon] Lyræ.

The actual distance between the components of [zeta] Lyra
is 44", or about one-fourth of the distance separating
[epsilon]^{1} from [epsilon]^{2}. The components of [zeta] are very
nearly equal in magnitude, in colour topaz and green, the topaz component
being estimated as of the fifth magnitude, the green component
intermediate between the fifth and sixth magnitudes.

We may now turn to a star not figured in the map, but readily found.
It will be noticed that the stars [epsilon], [alpha], [beta], and
[gamma] form, with two small stars towards the left, a somewhat
regular hexagonal figure--a hexagon, in fact, having three equal
long sides and three nearly equal short sides alternating with the
others.

The star [eta] Lyræ forms the angle next to [epsilon]. It is a
wide and unequal double, as figured in Plate 3.

The larger component is azure blue; the smaller is violet, and, being
only of the ninth magnitude, is somewhat difficult to catch with
apertures under 3 inches.

  The star [delta]^{2} Lyræ is orange, [delta]^{1} blue. In the same
  field with these are seen many other stars.
  
  The stars [gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} may also be seen in a single
  field, the distance between them being about half the moon's mean
diameter.

The former is quadruple, the components being yellow, bluish, pale
blue, and blue.

Turn next to the stars [beta] and [gamma] Lyræ, the former a multiple,
the latter an unequal double star. It is not, however, in these
respects that these stars are chiefly interesting, but for their
variability. The variability of [gamma] has not indeed been fully
established, though it is certain that, having once been less bright,
[gamma] is now considerably brighter than [beta].

The change, however, may be due to the variation of [beta] alone. This
star is one of the most remarkable variables known. Its period is 12d.
21h. 53m. 10s.

In this time it passes from a maximum brilliancy--that of a star of the
3·4 magnitude--to a minimum lustre equal to that of a star of the 4·3
magnitude, thence to the same maximum brilliancy as before, thence to
another minimum of lustre--that of a star of the 4·5 magnitude--and
so to its maximum lustre again, when the cycle of changes
recommences.

These remarkable changes seem to point to the existence of two
unequal dark satellites, whose dimensions bear a much greater
proportion to those of the bright components of [beta] Lyræ than the
dimensions of the members of the Solar System bear to those of the
sun. In this case, at any rate, the conjecture hazarded about Algol,
that the star revolves around a dark central orb, would be insufficient
to account for the observed variation.

  Nearly midway between [beta] and [gamma] lies the wonderful
  ring-nebula 57 M, of which an imperfect idea will be conveyed by the
  last figure of Plate 3. This nebula was discovered in 1772, by Darquier,
  at Toulouse.
  It is seen as a ring of light with very moderate telescopic power. In a
  good 3-1/2-inch telescope the nebula exhibits a mottled appearance and
  a sparkling light. Larger instruments exhibit a faint light within
  the ring; and in Lord Rosse's great Telescope "wisps of stars" are
  seen within, and faint streaks of light stream from the outer
border of the ring.

  This nebula has been subjected to spectrum-analysis by Mr.
  Huggins. It turns out to be a gaseous nebula! In fact, ring-nebulæ--of
  which only seven have been detected--seem to belong to the same
  class as the planetary nebulæ, all of which exhibit the line-spectrum
  indicative of gaseity. The brightest of the three lines seen in the
  spectrum of the ring-nebula in Lyra presents a rather peculiar
  appearance, "since it consists," says Mr.

Huggins, "of two bright dots, corresponding to sections of the ring,
and between these there is not darkness, but an excessively faint line
joining them. This observation makes it probable that the faint
nebulous matter occupying the central portion is similar in
constitution to that of the ring."
The constellation Hercules also contains many very interesting
objects.

  Let us first inspect a nebula presenting a remarkable contrast
  with that just described. I refer to the nebula 13 M, known as Halley's
  nebula (Plate 3). This nebula is visible to the naked eye, and in a
  good telescope it is a most wonderful object: "perhaps no one ever
  saw it for the first time without uttering a shout of wonder." It
  requires a very powerful telescope completely to resolve this fine
  nebula, but the outlying streamers may be resolved with a good 3-inch
  telescope. Sir W.
  Herschel considered that the number of the stars composing this
wonderful object was at least 14,000.

  
  You are so much like me, my darling, that I tremble for your
  happiness if you should happen to marry the wrong kind of man. I have
  wondered often if the story of my tragedy, terrible as it is for me to
  think of it, might not help you. And yet--it might do more harm than
  good. At any rate, I have written it all out, and put it with the
  other things in the box. I feel a curious sort of fatalism concerning
  this letter. It is borne in upon me that if you ever need to read it
  you will read it. It will help you to understand your father better.
  It may help you to understand your husband; although, God grant,
  knowledge like mine may never come to you.

  "Of one thing I am certain, you will never have anything to do with
  the woman who abused my friendship and took your father from me. I
  cannot carry my forgiveness far enough, even in the presence of death,
  to bid you go to him if she be still a part of his life.

  "I can write no more, my darling. I want you to know that you have
  been the dearest child a mother could have, and that you have never
  given me moment's uneasiness in my life. God bless and keep you.

  "MOTHER."

I did not weep when I had finished the letter. There was that in its
closing words that dried my tears. I put the pages reverently in
the envelope, laid it in the old box, closed and locked the lid, and
replaced it in the trunk. For my mother's bitter mention of the woman
who had stolen my father from her had brought back the old, wild
hatred I had felt for so many years.

"Whatever Robert Gordon can tell me of you, mother darling, I will
gladly hear," I whispered, as I locked her old trunk, "but I never
want to hear him talk of the woman who so cruelly ruined your life."


XXXV

THE WORD OF JACK


"O, pray do not let me disturb you."

Mother Graham drew back from the open door of the living room with
a little affected start of surprise at seeing me sitting before the
fire. Her words were courteous, but her manner brought the temperature
of the room down perceptibly.

She had managed to keep out of my way in clever fashion since the
scene of the day before, when she had attacked me concerning the
interest taken in me by Robert Gordon.

"You are not disturbing me in the least," I said, pleasantly, "I was
simply watching the fire. Jim certainly has outdone himself in the
matter of logs this time."

"Yes, he has," she admitted, grudgingly, as she came forward slowly
and took the chair I proffered her. "I only hope he doesn't set the
house afire with such a blaze. I must tell Richard to speak to him
about it."

Always the pin prick, the absolute ignoring of me as the mistress of
the house. I could not tell whether she had deliberately done it, or
whether long usage to dominance in a household had made her speak as
she did unconsciously.

I made no reply, and, for a long time, we sat staring at the fire
until Dicky's entrance came as a welcome interruption.

I went sedately to the door to meet him, although I was so glad to
see him that a dance step would more appropriately have expressed my
feelings, and returned his warm kiss and greeting. He kept my hand in
his as he came down to the fire, not even releasing it when he kissed
his mother, who still maintained the rigid dignity with which she
surrounded herself when displeased.

"Well," Dicky said, manfully ignoring any hint of unpleasantness,
"this is what I call comfortable, coming home to a fire and a welcome
like this on a dreary day."

There was a note of forced jollity in his voice that made me look up
quickly into his eyes. As they looked into mine, I caught a glimpse of
something half-hidden, half-revealed, something fiercely sombre, which
frightened me.

"What had happened," I asked myself, with a little clutch at my heart,
"to make Dicky look at me in this way?" I had a longing to take him
away where we could be alone.

I was glad when my mother-in-law rose stiffly from her chair.

"If you are too much occupied, Margaret," she remarked, icily, "I will
go and tell Katie that Richard is here, and that she may serve dinner
immediately."

She swept out of the room majestically, and as the door closed after
her Dicky caught me in his arms and clasped me so closely that I was
frightened.

"Tell me you love me," he said tensely, "better than anybody in the
world or out of it." His eyes were glowing with some emotion I could
not understand. I felt my vague uneasiness of his first entrance
deepen into real foreboding of something unknown and terrible coming
to me.

"Why, of course, you know that, sweetheart," I replied. "There is no
one for me but just you! But what is the matter? Something must be the
matter."

"Where did you get that idea?" he evaded. "I just wanted to be sure,
that's all. Wait here for me--I'll dash up and get some of the dust
off in a jiffy before dinner."

I spent an anxious interval before, he came down, for, despite his
denials, I felt that something out of the ordinary must have happened
to cause his queer, passionate outburst.

When he returned to, the living room, it was with no trace of any
emotion, and throughout the dinner, while not so given to conversation
as usual, he showed no indication that he was at all disturbed.

But I was very glad when the dinner was over, and we returned to the
living-room fire. And when, after a few minutes, my mother-in-law
yawned sleepily and went to her room, I drew a deep breath of relief.

Dicky drew my chair close to his, and we sat for a long time looking
at the leaping flames, only occasionally speaking.

It was at the end of a long silence that Dicky turned toward me, with
eyes so troubled that all my fears leaped up anew. I sprang to my
feet.

"What is it, Dicky?" I entreated, wildly. "Oh! I know something
terrible is the matter!"

He rose from his chair, and clasped my hands tightly.

"I suppose I'd better tell you quickly, dear," he replied. "Your
cousin, Jack Bickett, is reported killed."

"Killed!" I repeated faintly. "Jack Bickett killed! Oh, no, no,
Dicky; no, no, no!"

I heard my own voice rise to a sort of shriek, felt Dicky release my
hands and seize my shoulders, and then everything went black before
me, and I knew nothing more.

When I came to myself, I was lying on the couch before the fire, with
my face and the front of my gown dripping with water, the strong smell
of hartshorn in the room, and Dicky with stern, white face, and Katie
in tears, hovering over me.

Dicky was trying to force a spoon between my teeth when I opened my
eyes. He promptly dropped it, and the brandy it contained trickled
down my neck. I raised my hand to wipe it away, and Dicky uttered a
low, "Thank God!"

"Oh, she no dead, she alive again!" Katie cried out, and threw herself
on her knees by my side, sobbing.

"Get up, Katie, and stop that howling!" Dicky spoke sternly. "Do you
want to get my mother down here? Go upstairs at once and prepare Mrs.
Graham's bed for her. I will carry her up directly. Are you all right
now, Madge?"

His tone was anxious, but there was a note of constraint in it, which
I understood even through the returning anguish at Dicky's terrible
news, which was possessing me with returning consciousness.

He believed that my feeling for my brother-cousin, Jack Bickett, was a
deeper one than that which I had always professed, a sisterly love for
the only near relative I had in the world. This was the reason for his
sudden, passionate embrace of me when he entered the house, his demand
that I tell him I loved him better than anybody in the world or out of
it.

He had been jealous of Jack living, he would still be jealous of him
dead! But as the realization again swept over me that Jack, steadfast,
manly Jack, the only near relative I had, was no longer in the same
world with me, that never again would I see his kind eyes, hear his
deep, earnest voice, all thoughts of anything else but my loss fled
from me, and I gave a little moan.

I felt Dicky's arm which was around my shoulders shrink away
instinctively, then tighten again. He turned my face against his
shoulder, and, gathering me in his arms, lifted me from the couch.

"Oh, Dicky, I am sure I can walk," I protested faintly.

He stopped and looked at me fixedly.

"Don't you want my arms around you?" he asked, and there was that in
his voice which made me answer hastily:

"Of course I do, but I am afraid I am too heavy."

"Let me be the judge of that," he returned sternly, and forthwith
carried me up the stairs, down the hall, and laid me on the bed in my
own room.

"Now you must get that wet gown off," he said practically. "Katie
emptied nearly a gallon of water over you in her fright."

He smiled constrainedly, and I made a brave effort to return the
smile, but I could not accomplish it. Indeed, I was glad to be able to
keep back the tears, which I knew instinctively would hurt him.

He undressed me as tenderly as a woman could have done, and, wrapping
a warm bathrobe over my nightdress, for I was shivering as if from
a chill, tucked me in between the blankets of my bed. Then he drew a
chair to the bedside and sat down.

"Are you sure you are all right now?" he asked. "Your color is coming
back."

"Perfectly sure," I returned, "and I am so sorry to have made you so
much trouble."

"Don't say that," he returned, a trifle sharply. "It is so
meaningless. Try to sleep a little, can't you?"

"Not yet, Dicky," I returned. "I am feeling much better, however. Of
course, the shock was terrible at first, for, as you know, Jack was
the only brother I ever knew. But I am all right now and I want you to
tell me how you learned the news."

"Mrs. Stewart telephoned to me," he said. "It seems your cousin gave
her as the 'next of kin,' to be notified in case of his death, and
she received the notice this morning. There was nothing but the usual
official notification."

It was not until nearly daylight that the solution of my
problem came to me. Then I fell asleep, exhausted, and did not awaken
until Dicky came into the room, dressed for the journey which he took
daily to the city.

"I wouldn't disturb you, sweetheart," he said, "only it's time for
me to go in to the studio, and I did not want to leave you without
knowing how you are."

"Oh, have I slept so late?" I returned, contritely, springing up in
bed.

Dicky put me back with a firm hand.

"Lie still," he commanded, gently. "Katie will bring you up some
breakfast shortly, and there is no need of your getting up for hours."

He bent down to kiss me good-by. There was a restraint in both
his voice and his caress that told me he was still thinking of the
conversation of the night before. I put my arms about his neck and
drew his face down to mine.

"Sweetheart," I whispered, "I want to tell you what I've decided about
Jack's property."

"Not now," Dicky interrupted hurriedly.

"Yes, now," I returned decidedly. "I am going to accept it"--I gripped
his hands firmly as I felt them drawing away from mine, "but I am not
going to use any of it for myself. I will see that it all goes to the
orphaned kiddies of the soldiers with whom Jack fought."

Dicky started, looked at me a bit wildly, then stooped, and, gathering
me to him convulsively, pressed a long, tender kiss upon my lips.

"My own girl!" he murmured. "I shall not forget that you have done
this for me!"


XXXVI

"AND YET--"


"What's the big idea?"

Dicky looked up from the breakfast table with a mildly astonished air
as I came hurriedly into the room dressed for the street, wearing my
hat, and carrying my coat over my arm.

"I'm going into town with you," I returned quietly.

"Shopping, I suppose." The words sounded idle enough, but I, who knew
Dicky so well, recognized the note of watchfulness in the query.

"I shall probably go into some of the shops before I return," I said
carelessly, "but the real reason of my going into the city is Mrs.
Stewart. I should have gone to see her yesterday."

Dicky frowned involuntarily, but his face cleared again in an instant.
It was the second day after he had brought me the terrible news that
Jack Bickett, my brother-cousin, was reported killed "somewhere in
France." I knew that Dicky, in his heart, did not wish me to go to see
Mrs. Stewart, but I also knew that he was ashamed to give voice to his
reluctance.

When Dicky spoke at last, it was with just the right shade of cordial
acquiescence in his voice.

"Of course you must go to see her," he said, "but are you sure you're
feeling fit enough? It will try your nerves, I imagine."

Far better than Dicky could guess I knew what the day's ordeal would
be. Mrs. Stewart had been very fond of my brother-cousin. With my
mother, she had hoped that he and I would some day care for each
other. With her queer partisan ideas of loyalty, when Dicky had been
so cruelly unjust to me about Jack, she had wished me to divorce Dicky
and marry Jack, even though Jack himself had never whispered such a
solution of my life's problem. That she believed me to be responsible
for his going to the war I knew. I dreaded inexpressibly the idea of
facing her.

But when, after a rather silent trip to the city with Dicky, I stood
again in Mrs. Stewart's little upstairs sitting-room, I found only a
very sorrowful old woman, not a reproachful one.

"I thought you'd come today," she said, and her voice was tired,
dispirited. I felt a sudden compunction seize me that my visits to her
had been so few since Jack's going.

"I couldn't have kept away," I said, and then my old friend dropped my
hand, which she had been holding, and, sinking into a chair, put her
wrinkled old hands up to her face. I saw the slow tears trickling
through her fingers, and I knelt by her side and drew her head against
my shoulder, comforting her as she once had comforted me.

Mrs. Stewart was never one to give way to emotion, and it was but a
few moments before she drew herself erect, wiped her eyes, and said
quietly:

"I'll show you the cablegram."

She went to her desk, and drew out the message, clipped, abbreviated
in the puzzling fashion of cablegrams:

  "Regret inform you, Bickett killed, action French front. Details
  later."

  (Signed) "CAILLARD."

"Caillard? Caillard?" Where had I heard that name? Then I suddenly
remembered. Paul Caillard was the friend with whom Jack had gone
across the ocean to the Great War. I examined the paper carefully.

"I thought Dicky said you received the usual official notification," I
remarked.

"That's what I told him," she replied. "That's it."

"But this isn't an official message," I persisted.

"Why isn't it?"

I explained the difference haltingly, and spoke of the wonderful
system of identification in the French army, with every man tagged
with a metal identification check.

"You will probably receive the official notification in a few days," I
commented.

A queer, startled expression flashed into her face. She opened her
mouth, as if to speak, and then, looking at me sharply, closed
it again. Reaching out her hand for the cablegram, she folded it
mechanically, as if thinking of something far away, then going to her
desk, put it away, and stood as if thinking deeply for two or three
minutes, which seemed an hour to me.

At last I saw her body straighten. She gave a little shake of her
shoulders, as if rousing herself, and, turning from the desk, came
toward me. I saw that she held in her hand a bundle of letters.

"I understand that you and Jack made some fool agreement that he was
not to write to you, and that you were not even to read his letters
to me. I'm not expressing my opinion about it, but now that he's gone,
I'm going to turn these letters over to you. I'm not blind, you know.
Most of them were all really written to you, even if I did receive
them. Poor lad! It seems such a pity he should be struck down just as
a little happiness seemed coming his way."

She put the letters in my hands, and, turning swiftly, went out of
the room. I knew her well enough to realize that she would not return
until I had read the messages from Jack. But what in the world did she
mean by her last words?

I drew a big, easy chair to the fireside, and began to read the
missives. Some were short, some were long, but all were filled with
a quiet courage and cheerfulness that I knew had illuminated not only
Jack's letters to his old friend, but his life and the lives of others
wherever he had been. Every one of them had some reference to me--an
inquiry after my health, an injunction to Mrs. Stewart to be sure to
keep track of my happiness, a little kodak print or other souvenir
marked "For Margaret if I do not come back."

I felt guilty, remorseful, that I had seen so little of Mrs. Stewart
since his departure. My own affairs, especially my long, terrible
summer's experience with Grace Draper, had shut everything else from
my mind.

One letter in particular made my eyes brim with sudden tears. The
first of it had been cheery, with entertaining little accounts of the
few poor bits of humor which the soldiers in the trenches extracted
from their terrible every day round. Along toward the end a sudden
impulse seemed to have swept the writer's pen into a more sombre
channel.

"I have been thinking much, dear old friend," he wrote, "of the
futility of human desires. Life in the trenches is rather conducive to
that form of mediation, as you may imagine. You know, none better,
how I loved Margaret, how I wanted to make her my wife--I often wonder
whether if I had not delayed so long, 'fearing my fate too much,'
I might not have won her. But thoughts, like that are worse than
useless.

"Instead, there has come to me a clearer understanding of Margaret, a
better insight into the golden heart of her. If she had never met
the other man, or some one like him, I believe I could have made her
happy, kept her contented. But I realize fully that having met him
there could never be any other man for her but him. Her love for him
is like a flame, transforming her. I could never have called forth
such passion from her. I see clearly now how foolish it was in me to
have hoped it. There was nothing in the humdrum, commonplace brotherly
affection which she thought I gave her to arouse the romance which I
know slumbers under that calm, cold exterior of hers.

"Sometimes I query, too, whether my love for Margaret had that
flame-like quality which characterizes her love for her husband.
Margaret has always been so much a part of my life that my love for
her began I could not tell when, and grew and strengthened with the
years. There never has been any other woman but Margaret in my life.
Even if I should ever come out of this living hell, which I doubt, I
do not believe there ever will be another.

"And yet--"

"I have just been summoned for duty. Good-by, dear friend, until the
next time. Lovingly yours, Jack Bickett."

I laid the letter aside with a queer little startled feeling at my
heart.

Those two little words, "and yet," at the end of Jack's letter gave me
much food for thought. Was it possible that before his death Jack had
realized that his love for me was not the consuming passion he had
thought it, but partook more of the fraternal affection that I had had
for him?

I hoped for Jack's sake that this was so.

"And yet--"

I ran through the rest of the letters rapidly. One, the third from the
last, arrested my attention sharply.

"Such a pleasant thing happened to me today," Jack wrote, "one of the
unexpected gleams of sunlight that are so much brighter because of the
general gloom against which they are reflected.

"I was given a week's furlough last Saturday and went up to Paris with
my friend, Paul Caillard. He had a friend in a hospital on the way
there, headed by Dr. Braithwaite, the celebrated surgeon of Detroit."

I caught my breath. As well as if I had already read the words, I knew
what was coming.

"At an unexpected turn in the corridor I almost knocked over a
little nurse who was hurrying toward the office. She looked up at
me startled, out of the prettiest brown eyes I ever saw, and then
stopped, staring at me as if I had been a ghost. I stared back,
frankly, for her face was familiar to me, although for the moment I
could not tell where I had seen her before.

He loves them because he feels they felt as he does, and looked on
men and things much as he looks upon them himself; he is an outgrowth
in the same direction as that in which they grew; he is their son,
bound by every law of heredity to be no less them than himself; the
manner, therefore, which came most naturally to them will be the
one which comes also most naturally to him as being their descendant.

Nevertheless no matter how strong a family likeness may be, (and
it is sometimes, as between Handel and his forerunners, startlingly
close) two men of different generations will never be so much alike
that the work of each will not have a character of its own--unless
indeed the one is masquerading as the other, which is not tolerable
except on rare occasions and on a very small scale.

No matter how like his father a man may be we can always tell the two
apart; but this once given, so that he has a clear life of his own,
then a strong family likeness to some one else is no more to be
regretted or concealed if it exists than to be affected if it does
not.

It is on these terms alone that attractive music can be written,
and it is a musician's business to write attractive music.

He is, as it were, tenant for life of the estate of and trustee
for that school to which he belongs. Normally, that school
will be the one which has obtained the firmest hold upon his own
countrymen.

An Englishman cannot successfully write like a German or a Hungarian,
nor is it desirable that he should try. If, by way of variety, we
want German or Hungarian music we shall get a more genuine article
by going direct to German or Hungarian composers. For the most part,
however, the soundest Englishmen will be stay-at-homes, in spite
of their being much given to summer flings upon the continent.

Whether as writers, therefore, or as listeners, Englishmen should
stick chiefly to Purcell, Handel, and Sir Arthur Sullivan. True, Handel
was not an Englishman by birth, but no one was ever more thoroughly
English in respect of all the best and most distinguishing features of
Englishmen. As a young man, though Italy and Germany were open to
him, he adopted the country of Purcell, feeling it, doubtless, to be,
as far as he was concerned, more Saxon than Saxony itself.

He chose England; nor can there be a doubt that he chose it because
he believed it to be the country in which his music had the best chance
of being appreciated. And what does this involve, if not that England,
take it all round, is the most musically minded country in the world?
That this is so, that it has produced the finest music the world has
known, and is therefore the finest school of music in the world,
cannot be reasonably disputed.

To the born musician, it is hardly necessary to say, neither the foregoing
remarks nor any others about music, except those that may be found
in every text book, can be of the smallest use. Handel knew this and
no man ever said less about his art--or did more in it.

There are some semi-apocryphal {128} rules for tuning the harpsichord
that pretend, with what truth I know not, to hail from him, but here
his theoretical contributions to music begin and end.

The rules begin "In this chord" (the tonic major triad) "tune the fifth
pretty flat, and the third considerably too sharp." There is an absence
of fuss about these words which suggests Handel himself.

The written and spoken words of great painters or musicians who can
talk or write is seldom lasting--artists are a dumb inarticulate
folk, whose speech is in their hands not in their tongues.

They look at us like seals, but cannot talk to us. To the musician,
therefore, what has been said above is useless, if not worse; its
object will have been attained if it aids the uncreative reader to
criticise what he hears with more intelligence.

Music

So far as I can see, this is the least stable of the arts. From the
earliest records we learn that there were musicians, and people seem
to have been just as fond of music as we are ourselves, but, whereas
we find the old sculpture, painting (what there is of it) and
literature to have been in all essentials like our own, and not
only this but whereas we find them essentially the same in existing
nations in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, this is not so as
regards music either looking to antiquity or to the various existing
nations.

I believe we should find old Greek and Roman music as hideous as we
do Persian and Japanese, or as Persians and Japanese find our own.

I believe therefore that the charm of music rests on a more unreasoning
basis, and is more dependent on what we are accustomed to, than
the pleasure given by the other arts.

We now find all the ecclesiastical modes, except the Ionian and the
AEolian, unsatisfactory, indeed almost intolerable, but I question
whether, if we were as much in the habit of using the Dorian,
Phrygian, Lydian and Mixo-Lydian modes as we are of using the later
AEolian mode (the minor scale), we should not find these just as
satisfactory.

Is it not possible that our indisputable preference for the Ionian
mode (the major scale) is simply the result of its being the one
to which we are most accustomed?

If another mode were to become habitual, might not this scale or
mode become first a kind of supplementary moon-like mode (as the
AEolian now is) and finally might it not become intolerable to us?

Happily it will last my time as it is.

Discords

Formerly all discords were prepared, and Monteverde's innovation of
taking the dominant seventh unprepared was held to be cataclysmic,
but in modern music almost any conceivable discord may be taken
unprepared. We have grown so used to this now that we think nothing
of it, still, whenever it can be done without sacrificing something
more important, I think even a dominant seventh is better prepared.

It is only the preparation, however, of discords which is now less
rigorously insisted on; their resolution--generally by the climbing
down of the offending note--is as necessary as ever if the music
is to flow on smoothly.

This holds good exactly in our daily life. If a discord has to be
introduced, it is better to prepare it as a concord, take it on a
strong beat, and resolve it downwards on a weak one. The preparation
being often difficult or impossible may be dispensed with, but the
resolution is still de rigueur.

Anachronism

It has been said "Thou shalt not masquerade in costumes not of
thine own period," but the history of art is the history of revivals.

Musical criticism, so far as I can see, is the least intelligent
of the criticisms on this score.

Unless a man writes in the exotic style of Brahms, Wagner, Dvorak
and I know not what other Slav, Czech, Teuton or Hebrew, the critics
are sure to accuse him of being an anachronism.

The only man in England who is permitted to write in a style which is
in the main of home growth is the Irish Jew, Sir Arthur Sullivan.
If we may go to a foreign style why may we not go to one of an
earlier period?

But surely we may do whatever we like, and the better we like it
the better we shall do it.

The great thing is to make sure that we like the style we choose better
than we like any other, that we engraft on it whatever we hear that
we think will be a good addition, and depart from it wherever we
dislike it. If a man does this he may write in the style of the year
one and he will be no anachronism; the musical critics may call
him one but they cannot make him one.

Chapters in Music

The analogy between literature, painting and music, so close in so
many respects, suggests that the modern custom of making a whole
scene, act or even drama into a single, unbroken movement without
subdivision is like making a book without chapters, or a picture,
like Bernardino Luini's great Lugano fresco in which a long subject
is treated within the compass of a single piece.

Better advised, as it seems to me, Gaudenzio Ferrari broke up a
space of the same shape and size at Varallo into many compartments,
each more or less complete in itself, grouped round a central scene.

The subdivision of books into chapters, each with a more or less emphatic
full close in its own key, is found to be a help as giving the
attention halting places by the way.

Everything that is worth attending to fatigues as well as delights,
much as the climbing of a mountain does so.
Chapters and short pieces give rests during which the attention gathers
renewed strength and attacks with fresh ardour a new stretch of the
ascent.

Each bar is, as it were, a step cut in ice and one does not see,
if set pieces are objected to, why phrases and bars should not be
attacked next.

At the Opera

Jones and I went last Friday to Don Giovanni, Mr. Kemp {131} putting
us in free.

It bored us both, and we like Narcissus better. We admit the beauty
of many of the beginnings of the airs, but this beauty is not
maintained, in every case the air tails off into something that is
much too near being tiresome. The plot, of course, is stupid to a
degree, but plot has very little to do with it; what can be more
uninteresting than the plot of many of Handel's oratorios?

We both believe the scheme of Italian opera to be a bad one; we think
that music should never be combined with acting to a greater extent
than is done, we will say, in the Mikado; that the oratorio form
is far more satisfactory than opera; and we agreed that we had
neither of us ever yet been to an opera (I mean a Grand Opera) without
being bored by it. I am not sorry to remember that Handel never
abandoned oratorio after he had once fairly taken to it.

At a Philharmonic Concert

We went last night to the Philharmonic and sat in the shilling orchestra,
just behind the drums, so that we could see and hear what each instrument
was doing. The concert began with Mozart's G Minor Symphony. We
liked this fairly well, especially the last movement, but
we found all the movements too long and, speaking for myself, if I
had a tame orchestra for which I might write programmes, I should
probably put it down once or twice again, not from any spontaneous
wish to hear more of it but as a matter of duty that I might judge
it with fuller comprehension--still, if each movement had been half
as long I should probably have felt cordially enough towards it,
except of course in so far as that the spirit of the music is alien
to that of the early Italian school with which alone I am in genuine
sympathy and of which Handel is the climax.

Then came a terribly long-winded recitative by Beethoven and an
air with a good deal of "Che faro" in it. I do not mind this, and
if it had been "Che faro" absolutely I should, I daresay, have
liked it better.

I never want to hear it again and my orchestra should never play
it.

Beethoven's Concerto for violin and orchestra (op. 61) which followed
was longer and more tedious still.

I have not a single good word for it. If the subject of the last
movement was the tune of one of Arthur Robert's comic songs, or
of any music-hall song, it would do very nicely and I daresay we
should often hum it.

I do not mean at the opening of the movement but about half way
through, where the character is just that of a common music-hall
song and, so far, good.

Part II opened with a suite in F Major for orchestra (op. 39) by
Moszkowski. This was much more clear and, in every way, interesting
than the Beethoven; every now and then there were passages that
were pleasing, not to say more.

Jones liked it better than I did; still, one could not feel that any
of the movements were the mere drivelling show stuff of which the
concerto had been full. But it, like everything else done at these
concerts, is too long, cut down one- half it would have been all
right and we should have liked to hear it twice.

As it was, all we could say was that it was much better than we had
expected. I did not like the look of the young man who wrote it and who
also conducted. He had long yellowish hair and kept tossing his
head to fling it back on to his shoulders, instead of keeping it short
as Jones and I keep ours.

Then came Schubert's "Erl Konig," which, I daresay, is very fine but
with which I have absolutely nothing in common.

And finally there was a tiresome characteristic overture by
Berlioz, which, if Jones could by any possibility have written
anything so dreary, I should certainly have begged him not to
publish.

The general impression left upon me by the concert is that all the
movements were too long, and that, no matter how clever the development
may be, it spoils even the most pleasing and interesting subject if
there is too much of it.

Handel knew when to stop and, when he meant stopping, he stopped
much as a horse stops, with little, if any, peroration.

Who can doubt that he kept his movements short because he knew that the
worst music within a reasonable compass is better than the best
which is made tiresome by being spun out unduly?

I only know one concerted piece of Handel's which I think too long,
I mean the overture to Saul, but I have no doubt that if I were to
try to cut it down I should find some excellent reason that had
made Handel decide on keeping it as it is.

At the Wind Concerts

There have been some interesting wind concerts lately; I say
interesting, because they brought home to us the unsatisfactory
character of wind unsupported by strings. I rather pleased Jones
by saying that the hautbois was the clarionet with a cold in its head,
and the bassoon the same with a cold on its chest.

At a Handel Festival

i
The large sweeps of sound floated over the orchestra like the wind
playing upon a hill-side covered with young heather, and I sat and
wondered which of the Alpine passes Handel crossed when he went
into Italy.

What time of the year was it? What kind of weather did he have? Were
the spring flowers out? Did he walk the greater part of the way as we
do now?

And what did he hear? For he must sometimes have heard music inside
him--and that, too, as much above what he has written down as what he
has written down is above all other music.
No man can catch all, or always the best, of what is put for a moment
or two within his reach. Handel took as much and as near the best,
doubtless, as mortal man can take; but he must have had moments and
glimpses which were given to him alone and which he could tell no
man.

ii
I saw the world a great orchestra filled with angels whose instruments
were of gold.

And I saw the organ on the top of the axis round which all should turn,
but nothing turned and nothing moved and the angels stirred not and all
was as still as a stone, and I was myself also, like the rest, as
still as a stone.

Then I saw some huge, cloud-like forms nearing, and behold! it was
the Lord bringing two of his children by the hand.

"O Papa!" said one, "isn't it pretty?"
"Yes, my dear," said the Lord, "and if you drop a penny into the box
the figures will work."
Then I saw that what I had taken for the keyboard of the organ was
no keyboard but only a slit, and one of the little Lords dropped a
plaque of metal into it. And then the angels played and the world turned
round and the organ made a noise and the people began killing one
another and the two little Lords clapped their hands and were
delighted.

Handel and Dickens

They buried Dickens in the very next grave, cheek by jowl with Handel.
It does not matter, but it pained me to think that people who could
do this could become Deans of Westminster.

IX--A PAINTER'S VIEWS ON PAINTING

The Old Masters and Their Pupils

The old masters taught, not because they liked teaching, nor yet from
any idea of serving the cause of art, nor yet because they were
paid to teach by the parents of their pupils.
I did not care to think what he might be when
enraged at her as I knew he must be now.

Nothing of my feeling, however, must I betray to the friend who had
come to me for help and comfort. I drew closer the arms that had not
yet released her.

"Dear girl," I said softly, "don't worry any more about your husband
or anything else. Just consider that you've come home to your sister.

"He can be dangerously
fascinating, you know."

Dicky laughed in a way that showed me his brainstorm over Robert
Gordon had been checked. But there was a startled look in his eyes
which changed to a more speculative scrutiny before he moved away.

"Oh, old Harry's all right," he said. "He's my pal, and he never means
anything, anyway." But I noticed that he said it as if he were trying
to convince himself of the truth of his assertion.

When I told Harry Underwood that he was to take me in to dinner, and
we were leading the way into the dining room, his brilliant black eyes
looked down into mine mockingly, and he said:

"You see it is Fate. No matter how you struggle against it you cannot
escape me."

"Do I look as if I were struggling?" I laughed back, and saw a sudden
expression of bewilderment in his eyes, followed instantly by a flash
of triumph.

Everything that was cattishly feminine in me leaped to life at that
look in the eyes of the man whom I detested, whom I had even feared.
I could read plainly enough in his eyes that he thought the assiduous
flatteries he had always paid me were commencing to have their result,
that I was beginning to recognize the dangerous fascination he was
reputed to have for women of every station. I had a swift, savage
desire to avenge the women he must have made suffer, to hurt him as
before dinner he had wounded Lillian.

So instead of turning an impassive face to Mr. Underwood's remark, I
listened with just the hint of an elusive mischievous smile twisting
my lips.

"No, you don't look very uncomfortable. Night-Shirts and Babies

On Hindhead, last Easter, we saw a family wash hung out to dry.

There were papa's two great night-shirts and mamma's two lesser
night-gowns and then the children's smaller articles of clothing
and mamma's drawers and the girls' drawers, all full swollen with
a strong north-east wind.

But mamma's night-gown was not so well pinned on and, instead of
being full of steady wind like the others, kept blowing up and down
as though she were preaching wildly.

We stood and laughed for ten minutes.

The housewife came to the window and wondered at us, but we could
not resist the pleasure of watching the absurdly life-like gestures
which the night-gowns made.

I should like a Santa Famiglia with clothes drying in the background.

A love story might be told in a series of sketches of the clothes
of two families hanging out to dry in adjacent gardens. Then a
gentleman's night-shirt from one garden, and a lady's night-gown from
the other should be shown hanging in a third garden by themselves.

By and by there should be added a little night-shirt.

A philosopher might be tempted, on seeing the little night-shirt, to
suppose that the big night-shirts had made it. What we do is much the
same, for the body of a baby is not much more made by the two old
babies, after whose pattern it has cut itself out, than the little
night-shirt is made by the big ones.

The thing that makes either the little night-shirt or the little
baby is something about which we know nothing whatever at all.

Our Organism

Man is a walking tool-box, manufactory, workshop and bazaar worked from
behind the scenes by someone or something that we never see. We are so
used to never seeing more than the tools, and these work so smoothly,
that we call them the workman himself, making much the same mistake
as though we should call the saw the carpenter.

The only workman of whom we know anything at all is the one that runs
ourselves and even this is not perceivable by any of our gross palpable
senses.

The senses seem to be the link between mind and matter--never forgetting
that we can never have either mind or matter pure and without alloy
of the other.

Beer and My Cat

Spilt beer or water seems sometimes almost human in its uncertainty
whether or no it is worth while to get ever such a little nearer to
the earth's centre by such and such a slight trickle forward.

I saw my cat undecided in his mind whether he should get up on the
table and steal the remains of my dinner or not.

The chair was some eighteen inches away with its back towards the
table, so it was a little troublesome for him to get his feet first
on the bar and then on the table.

He was not at all hungry but he tried, saw it would not be quite easy
and gave it up; then he thought better of it and tried again, and saw
again that it was not all perfectly plain sailing; and so backwards
and forwards with the first-he-would-and- then-he-wouldn'tism of a
mind so nearly in equilibrium that a hair's weight would turn the
scale one way or the other.

I thought how closely it resembled the action of beer trickling on a
slightly sloping table.

The Union Bank

There is a settlement in the Union Bank building, Chancery Lane,
which has made three large cracks in the main door steps.

I remember these cracks more than twenty years ago, just after the
bank was built, as mere thin lines and now they must be some half
an inch wide and are still slowly widening.

They have altered very gradually, but not an hour or a minute has
passed without a groaning and travailing together on the part of
every stone and piece of timber in the building to settle how a
modus vivendi should be arrived at.

This is why the crack is said to be caused by a settlement--some parts
of the building willing this and some that, and the battle going on,
as even the steadiest and most unbroken battles must go, by fits and
starts which, though to us appearing as an even tenor, would, if
we could see them under a microscope, prove to be a succession of
bloody engagements between regiments that sometimes lost and sometimes
won.

Sometimes, doubtless, strained relations have got settled by peaceful
arbitration and reference to the solicitors of the contending parts
without open visible rupture; at other times, again, discontent has
gathered on discontent as the snow upon a sub-alpine slope, flake
by flake, till the last is one too many and the whole comes crashing
down--whereon the cracks have opened some minute fraction of an
inch wider.

Of this we see nothing. All we note is that a score of years have
gone by and that the cracks are rather wider. So, doubtless, if the
materials of which the bank is built could speak, they would say
they knew nothing of the varied interests that sometimes coalesce
and sometimes conflict within the building.

The joys of the rich depositor, the anguish of the bankrupt are nothing
to them; the stream of people coming in and going out is as steady,
continuous a thing to them as a blowing wind or a running river to
ourselves; all they know or care about is that they have a trifle more
weight of books and clerks and bullion than they once had, and that
this hinders them somewhat in their effort after a permanent
settlement.

The Unity of Nature

I meet a melancholy old Savoyard playing on a hurdy-gurdy, grisly,
dejected, dirty, with a look upon him as though the iron had long since
entered into his soul. It is a frosty morning but he has very little
clothing, and there is a dumb despairing look about him which is surely
genuine. There passes him a young butcher boy with his tray of meat
upon his shoulder. He is ruddy, lusty, full of life and health and
spirits, and he vents these in a shrill whistle which eclipses the
hurdy-gurdy of the Savoyard.

The like holds good with the horses and cats and dogs which I meet
daily, with the flies in window panes and with plants, some are
successful, other have now passed their prime.

Look at the failures per se and they make one very unhappy, but it helps
matters to look at them in their capacities as parts of a whole
rather than as isolated.

I cannot see things round about me without feeling that they
are all parts of one whole which is trying to do something; it has
not perhaps a perfectly clear idea of what it is trying after, but
it is doing its best.

I see old age, decay and failure as the relaxation, after effort,
of a muscle in the corporation of things, or as a tentative effort
in a wrong direction, or as the dropping off of particles of skin
from a healthy limb.

This dropping off is the death of any given generation of our cells
as they work their way nearer and nearer to our skins and then get
rubbed off and go away.

It is as though we sent people to live nearer and nearer the churchyard
the older they grew. As for the skin that is shed, in the first place
it has had its turn, in the second it starts anew under fresh auspices,
for it can at no time cease to be part of the universe, it must always
live in one way or another.

Croesus and His Kitchen-Maid

I want people to see either their cells as less parts of themselves
than they do, or their servants as more.

Croesus's kitchen-maid is part of him, bone of his bone and flesh of
his flesh, for she eats what comes from his table and, being fed of one
flesh, are they not brother and sister to one another in virtue
of community of nutriment which is but a thinly veiled travesty
of descent?

When she eats peas with her knife, he does so too; there is not a bit
of bread and butter she puts into her mouth, nor a lump of sugar
she drops into her tea, but he knoweth it altogether, though he
knows nothing whatever about it.

She is en-Croesused and he enscullery-maided so long as she
remains linked to him by the golden chain which passes from his
pocket to hers, and which is greatest of all unifiers.

True, neither party is aware of the connection at all as long as
things go smoothly.

Croesus no more knows the name of, or feels the existence of, his
kitchen-maid than a peasant in health knows about his liver;
nevertheless he is awakened to a dim sense of an undefined something
when he pays his grocer or his baker.

She is more definitely aware of him than he of her, but it is by way of
an overshadowing presence rather than a clear and intelligent
comprehension.

And though Croesus does not eat his kitchen-maid's meals otherwise
than vicariously, still to eat vicariously is to eat:
the meals so eaten by his kitchen-maid nourish the better ordering
of the dinner which nourishes and engenders the better ordering of
Croesus himself.

He is fed therefore by the feeding of his kitchen- maid.

And so with sleep. When she goes to bed he, in part, does so too.
When she gets up and lays the fire in the back-kitchen he, in part,
does so.

He lays it through her and in her, though knowing no more what he
is doing than we know when we digest, but still doing it as by what
we call a reflex action.

Qui facit per alium facit per se, and when the back-kitchen fire
is lighted on Croesus's behalf, it is Croesus who lights it, though
he is all the time fast asleep in bed.

Sometimes things do not go smoothly. Suppose the kitchen-maid to be taken
with fits just before dinner-time; there will be a reverberating
echo of disturbance throughout the whole organisation of the palace.

But the oftener she has fits, the more easily will the household
know what it is all about when she is taken with them.
On the first occasion Lady Croesus will send some one rushing down
into the kitchen, there will, in fact, be a general flow of blood
(i.e. household) to the part affected (that is to say, to the
scullery-maid); the doctor will be sent for and all the rest of it.

On each repetition of the fits the neighbouring organs, reverting to a
more primary undifferentiated condition, will discharge duties for
which they were not engaged, in a manner for which no one would have
given them credit, and the disturbance will be less and less each
time, till by and by, at the sound of the crockery smashing below, Lady
Croesus will just look up to papa and say:
"My dear, I am afraid Sarah has got another fit."

And papa will say she will probably be better again soon, and will go
on reading his newspaper.

In course of time the whole thing will come to be managed automatically
downstairs without any reference either to papa, the cerebrum, or to
mamma, the cerebellum, or even to the medulla oblongata, the
housekeeper.

A precedent or routine will be established, after which everything
will work quite smoothly.

But though papa and mamma are unconscious of the reflex action which
has been going on within their organisation, the kitchen-maid and
the cells in her immediate vicinity (that is to say her fellow-servants)
will know all about it.

Perhaps the neighbours will think that nobody in the house knows, and
that because the master and mistress show no sign of disturbance
therefore there is no consciousness.

They forget that the scullery-maid becomes more and more conscious
of the fits if they grow upon her, as they probably will, and that
Croesus and his lady do show more signs of consciousness, if they
are watched closely, than can be detected on first inspection.

There is not the same violent perturbation that there was on the previous
occasions, but the tone of the palace is lowered. A dinner party
has to be put off; the cooking is more homogeneous and uncertain,
it is less highly differentiated than when the scullery-maid was
well; and there is a grumble when the doctor has to be paid and
also when the smashed crockery has to be replaced.

If Croesus discharges his kitchen-maid and gets another, it is as
though he cut out a small piece of his finger and replaced it in
due course by growth.

But even the slightest cut may lead to blood- poisoning, and so
even the dismissal of a kitchen-maid may be big with the fate of
empires.

Thus the cook, a valued servant, may take the kitchen-maid's part and
go too. The next cook may spoil the dinner and upset Croesus's temper,
and from this all manner of consequences may be evolved, even to
the dethronement and death of the king himself.

Nevertheless as a general rule an injury to such a low part of a great
monarch's organism as a kitchen-maid has no important results. It
is only when we are attacked in such vital organs as the solicitor
or the banker that we need be uneasy.

A wound in the solicitor is a very serious thing, and many a
man has died from failure of his bank's action.

It is certain, as we have seen, that when the kitchen-maid lights
the fire it is really Croesus who is lighting it, but it is less
obvious that when Croesus goes to a ball the scullery-maid goes
also.

Still this should be held in the same way as it should be also held that
she eats vicariously when Croesus dines. For he must return the balls
and the dinner parties and this comes out in his requiring to keep a
large establishment whereby the scullery-maid retains her place
as part of his organism and is nourished and amused also.

On the other hand, when Croesus dies it does not follow that the
scullery-maid should die at the same time. She may grow a new Croesus,
as Croesus, if the maid dies, will probably grow a new kitchen-maid,
Croesus's son or successor may take over the kingdom and palace,
and the kitchen-maid, beyond having to wash up a few extra plates
and dishes at Coronation time, will know little about the change.

It is as though the establishment had had its hair cut and its beard
trimmed; it is smartened up a little, but there is no other change.

If, on the other hand, he goes bankrupt, or his kingdom is taken
from him and his whole establishment is broken up and dissipated at the
auction mart, then, even though not one of its component cells
actually dies, the organism as a whole does so, and it is interesting
to see that the lowest, least specialised and least highly differentiate
parts of the organism, such as the scullery-maid and the stable-boys,
most readily find an entry into the life of some new system, while
the more specialised and highly differentiated parts, such as the
steward, the old housekeeper and, still more so, the librarian or
the chaplain may never be able to attach themselves to any new
combination, and may die in consequence.

I heard once of a large builder who retired unexpectedly from business
and broke up his establishment to the actual death of several of his
older employes.

So a bit of flesh or even a finger may be taken from one body and
grafted on to another, but a leg cannot be grafted; if a leg is cut
off it must die. It may, however, be maintained that the owner
dies too, even though he recovers, for a man who has lost a
leg is not the man he was. {92}
VII--ON THE MAKING OF MUSIC, PICTURES AND BOOKS
Thought and Word 

i
Thought pure and simple is as near to God as we can get; it is
through this that we are linked with God.

The highest thought is ineffable; it must be felt from one person
to another but cannot be articulated.

All the most essential and thinking part of thought is done without
words or consciousness.

It is not till doubt and consciousness enter that words become
possible.

The moment a thing is written, or even can be written, and reasoned
about, it has changed its nature by becoming tangible, and hence
finite, and hence it will have an end in disintegration. It has
entered into death.

And yet till it can be thought about and realised more or less definitely
it has not entered into life. Both life and death are necessary factors
of each other. But our profoundest and most important convictions are
unspeakable.

So it is with unwritten and indefinable codes of honour, conventions,
art-rules--things that can be felt but not explained--these are the
most important, and the less we try to understand them, or even to
think about them, the better.

ii
Words are organised thoughts, as living forms are organised
actions.

How a thought can find embodiment in words is nearly, though perhaps
not quite, as mysterious as how an action can find embodiment in
form, and appears to involve a somewhat analogous transformation
and contradiction in terms.

There was a time when language was as rare an accomplishment as writing
was in the days when it was first invented. Probably talking was
originally confined to a few scholars, as writing was in the middle
ages, and gradually became general. Even now speech is still growing;
poor folks cannot understand the talk of educated people.
Perhaps reading and writing will indeed one day come by nature.
Analogy points in this direction, and though analogy is often
misleading, it is the least misleading thing we have.

iii
Communications between God and man must always be either above
words or below them; for with words come in translations, and all
the interminable questions therewith connected.

iv
The mere fact that a thought or idea can be expressed articulately
in words involves that it is still open to question; and the mere
fact that a difficulty can be definitely conceived involves that
it is open to solution.

v
We want words to do more than they can. We try to do with them what
comes to very much like trying to mend a watch with a pickaxe or
to paint a miniature with a mop; we expect them to help us to grip
and dissect that which in ultimate essence is as ungrippable as
shadow.

Nevertheless there they are; we have got to live with them, and the
wise course is to treat them as we do our neighbours, and make the
best and not the worst of them. But they are parvenu people as
compared with thought and action. What we should read is not the words
but the man whom we feel to be behind the words.

vi
Words impede and either kill, or are killed by, perfect thought; but
they are, as a scaffolding, useful, if not indispensable, for the
building up of imperfect thought and helping to perfect it.

vii
All words are juggles. To call a thing a juggle of words is often
a bigger juggle than the juggle it is intended to complain of.

The question is whether it is a greater juggle than is generally
considered fair trading.

viii
Words are like money; there is nothing so useless, unless when in
actual use.

ix
Gold and silver coins are only the tokens, symbols, outward and
visible signs and sacraments of money.

When not in actual process of being applied in purchase they are no
more money than words not in use are language. Books are like
imprisoned souls until some one takes them down from a shelf and
reads them. The coins are potential money as the words are potential
language, it is the power and will to apply the counters that make
them vibrate with life; when the power and the will are in abeyance
the counters lie dead as a log.

The Law

The written law is binding, but the unwritten law is much more
so.
You may break the written law at a pinch and on the sly if you can,
but the unwritten law--which often comprises the written--must not
be broken.

Not being written, it is not always easy to know what it is, but
this has got to be done.

Ideas

They are like shadows--substantial enough until we try to grasp
them.

Expression

The fact that every mental state is intensified by expression is
of a piece with the fact that nothing has any existence at all save
in its expression.

Development

All things are like exposed photographic plates that have no
visible image on them till they have been developed.

Acquired Characteristics
If there is any truth in the theory that these are inherited--and
who can doubt it?

--the eye and the finger are but the aspiration, or word, made
manifest in flesh.

Physical and Spiritual

The bodies of many abandoned undertakings lie rotting unburied up
and down the country and their ghosts haunt the law-courts.

Trail and Writing

Before the invention of writing the range of one man's influence
over another was limited to the range of sight, sound and scent;
besides this there was trail, of many kinds.

Trail unintentionally left is, as it were, hidden sight.

Left intentionally, it is the unit of literature. It is the first mode
of writing, from which grew that power of extending men's influence
over one another by the help of written symbols of all kinds without
which the development of modern civilisation would have been
impossible.

Conveyancing and the Arts

In conveyancing the ultimately potent thing is not the deed but the
invisible intention and desire of the parties to the deed; the written
document itself is only evidence of this intention and desire. So it
is with music, the written notes are not the main thing, nor is
even the heard performance; these are only evidences of an internal
invisible emotion that can be felt but never fully expressed.

And so it is with the words of literature and with the forms and
colours of painting.

The Rules for Making Literature, Music and Pictures

The arts of the musician, the painter and the writer are essentially
the same.
But anyway I'm
going to be gone quite a stretch, and when I come back I'll try to be
a reformed character. But remember, wherever I am 'me art is true to
Poll.'"

He bowed mockingly with his old manner, and walked toward the door,
meeting Lillian as she came in.

"So long, Lil," he said carelessly. "I'm going for a long walk. See
you later."

She looked at him searchingly. "All right," she answered laconically,
and then came over to me.

"Mr. Gordon will be here in a half-hour," she said. "Please try to
rest a little before he comes."

She lowered the shades, and my pillows, kissed me gently, and left the
room. But I could neither rest nor sleep. The wildest conjectures went
through my brain. Who was Robert Gordon, and why was he so strangely
interested in me?


XL

MADGE FACES THE PAST AND HEARS A DOOR SOFTLY CLOSE


It seemed a very long time to me, as I tossed on my pillows, beset by
the problem that even the name Robert Gordon always presents to me,
before Lillian came back to my room. But when she entered she said
that Mr. Gordon would soon arrive and that I must be prepared to see
him, so she bathed my hands and face and gave me an egg-nog before
propping me up against my pillows to receive my visitor.

"Of course you will stay with me, Lillian, while he is here," I said.

She smiled enigmatically. "Part of the time," she said.

But when Mr. Gordon came, bringing with him an immense sheaf of roses,
she left the room almost at once, giving as an excuse her wish to
arrange the flowers.

My visitor's eyes were burning with a light that almost frightened me
as he sat down by my bedside and took my hand in his.

"My dear child," he said, and though the words were such as any
elderly man might address to a young woman, yet there was an intensity
in them that made me uncomfortable. "Are you sure everything is all
right with you?"

"Very sure," I replied, smiling. "If Mrs. Underwood would permit me to
do so, I am certain I could get up now."

"You must not think of trying it," he returned sharply, and with a
note in his voice, almost like authority, which puzzled me.

"Thank God for Mrs. Underwood!" he went on. "She is a woman in a
thousand. I am indebted to her for life."

I shrank back among my pillows, and wished that Lillian would return
to the room. I began to wonder if Mr. Gordon's brain was not slightly
turned. Surely, the fact that he had once known and loved my mother
was no excuse for the extravagant attitude he was taking.

He saw the movement, and into his eyes flashed a look so mournful, so
filled with longing that I was thrilled to the heart. The next moment
he threw himself upon his knees by the side of my bed, and cried out
tensely:

"Oh, my darling child, don't shrink from me. You will kill me. Don't
you see? Can't you guess? I am your father!"

My father! Robert Gordon my father!

I looked at the elderly man kneeling beside my bed, and my brain
whirled with the unreality of it all. The "man of mystery," the
"Quester" of Broadway, the elderly soldier of fortune, about whose
reputed wealth and constant searching of faces wherever he was the
idle gossip of the city's Bohemia had whirled--to think that this man
was the father I had never known, the father, alas! whom I had hoped
never to know.

Everything was clear to me now--the reason for his staring at me when
he first caught sight of me in the Sydenham Hotel, his trailing of my
movements until he had found out my name and home, the introduction
he obtained to Dicky, and through him to me, his emotion at hearing
my mother's name, his embarrassing attentions to me ever since--the
explanation for all of which had puzzled me had come in the choking
words of the man whose head was bowed against my bed, and whose whole
frame was shaking with suppressed sobs.

I felt myself trembling in the grip of a mighty surge of longing to
gather that bowed gray head into my arms and lavish the love he longed
for upon my father. My heart sang a little hymn of joy. I, who had
been kinless, with no one of my own blood, had found a father!

And then, with my hand outstretched, almost touching my father's head,
the revulsion came.

True, this man was my father, but he was also the man who had made my
mother's life one long tragedy. All my life I had schooled myself to
hate the man who had deserted my mother and me when I was four years
old, who had added to the desertion the insult of taking with him the
woman who had been my mother's most intimate friend. My love for my
mother had been the absorbing emotion of my life, until she had left
me, and because of that love I had loathed the very thought of the man
who had caused her to suffer so terribly.

My father lifted his head and looked at me, and there was that in his
eyes which made me shudder. It was the look of a prisoner in the dock,
waiting to receive a sentence.

"Of course, I know you must hate the very sight of me, Margaret," he
said brokenly. "I had not meant to tell you so soon. But I have to go
away almost at once to South America, and it is very uncertain when I
shall return. I could not bear to go without your knowing how I have
loved and longed for you.

"Never so great a sinner as I, my child," the weary old voice went
on, "but, oh, if you could know my bitter repentance, my years of
loneliness."

His voice tore at my heart strings, but I steeled myself against him.
One thing I must know.

"Where is the person with whom--" I could not finish the words.

"I do not know." The words rang true. I was sure he was not lying to
me. "I have not seen or heard of her in over twenty years."

Then the association had not lasted. I had a sudden clairvoyant
glimpse into my father's soul. My mother had been the real love of
his life. His infatuation for the other woman had been but a temporary
madness. What long drawn out, agonized repentance must have been his
for twenty years with wife, child and home lost to him!

I leaned back and closed my eyes for a minute, overwhelmed with the
problem which confronted me. And then--call it hallucination or what
you will--I heard my mother's voice, as clearly as I ever heard it in
life, repeating the words I had read weeks before in the letter she
had left for me at her death.

"Remember it is my last wish, Margaret, that if your father be living
sometime you may be reconciled to him."

I opened my eyes with a little cry of thanksgiving. It was as if my
mother had stretched out her hand from heaven to sanction the one
thing I most longed to do.

"Father!" I gasped. "Oh, my father, I have wanted you so."

He uttered a little cry of joy, and then my father's arms were around
me, my face was close to his, and for the first time since I was a
baby of four years I knew my father's kisses.

A smothered sound, almost like a groan, startled me, and then the door
slammed shut.

"What was that?" I asked. "Is there any one there?"

My father raised his head. "No, there is no one there," he said. "See,
the wind is rising. It must have been that which slammed the door. I
think I would better shut the window."

He moved over to the window, which Lillian had kept partly ajar for
air, and closed it. Then he returned to my bedside.

"There is one thing I must ask you to do, my child," he said
hesitatingly, "and that is to keep secret the fact that instead of
being Robert Gordon, I am in reality Charles Robert Gordon Spencer,
and your father. Of course your husband must know and Mrs. Underwood,
as her husband is going with me to South America. But I should advise
very strongly against the knowledge coming into the possession of any
one else.

"I cannot explain to you now, why I dropped part of my name, or why I
exact this promise," he went on, "but it is imperative that I do ask
it, and that you heed the request. You will respect my wishes in this
matter, will you not, my daughter?"

It was all very stilted, almost melodramatic, but my father was so
much in earnest that I readily gave the promise he asked. With a look
of relief he took a package from his pocket and handed it to me.

"Keep this carefully," he said. "It contains all the data which you
will need in case of my death. Rumor says that I am a very rich man.
As usual rumor is wrong, but I have enough so that you will always
be comfortable. And for fear that something might happen to you in
my absence I have placed to your account in the Knickerbocker money
enough for any emergency, also for any extra spending money you may
wish. The bank book is among these papers. I trust that you will use
it. I shall like to feel that you are using it. And now good-by. I
shall not see you again."

He kissed me, lingeringly, tenderly, and went out of the room. I lay
looking at the package he had given me, wondering if it were all a
dream.


XLI

WHY DID DICKY GO?


"Margaret, I have the queerest message from Richard. I cannot make it
out."

My mother-in-law rustled into my room, her voice querulous, her face
expressing the utmost bewilderment.

"What is it, mother?" I asked nervously. It was late afternoon of the
day in which Robert Gordon had revealed his identity as my father, and
my nerves were still tense from the shock of the discovery.

"Why, Richard has left the city. He telephoned me just now that he
had an unexpected offer at an unusual sum to do some work in San
Francisco, I think, he said, and that he would be gone some months. If
he accepted the offer he would have no time to come home. He said he
would write to both of us tonight. What do you suppose it means?"

"I--do--not--know," I returned slowly and truthfully, but there was a
terrible frightened feeling at my heart. Dicky gone for months without
coming to bid me good-by! My world seemed to whirl around me. But I
must do or say nothing to alarm my mother-in-law. Her weak heart made
it imperative that she be shielded from worry of any kind.

I rallied every atom of self-control I possessed. "There is nothing
to worry about, mother," I said carelessly. "Dicky has often spoken
recently about this offer to go to San Francisco. It was always
tentative before, but he knew that when it did come he would have to
go at a minute's notice. You know he always keeps a bag packed at the
studio for just such emergencies."

The last part of my little speech was true. Dicky did keep a bag
packed for the emergency summons he once in a while received from his
clients. But I had never heard of the trip to San Francisco. But I
must reassure my mother-in-law in some way.

"Well, I think it's mighty queer," she grumbled, going out of the
room.

"You adorable little fibber!" Lillian said tenderly, rising, and
coming over to me. Her voice was gay, but I who knew its every
intonation, caught an undertone of worry.

"Lillian!" I exclaimed sharply. "What is it? Do you know anything?"

"Hush, child," she said firmly. "I know nothing. You will hear all
about it tomorrow morning when you receive Dicky's letters. Until then
you must be quiet and brave."

It was like her not to adjure me to keep from worrying. She never did
the usual futile things. But all through my wakeful night, whenever I
turned over or uttered the slightest sound, she was at my side in an
instant.

Never until death stops my memory will I forget that next morning with
its letters from Dicky.

There was one for my mother-in-law, none for me, but I saw an envelope
in Lillian's hand, which I was sure was from my husband, even before I
had seen the shocked pallor which spread over her face as she read it.

"Oh, Lillian, what is it?" I whispered in terror.

"Wait," she commanded. "Do not let your mother-in-law guess anything
is amiss."

But when Mother Graham's demand to know what Dicky had written to me
had been appeased by Lillian's offhand remark that country mails were
never reliable, and that my letter would probably arrive later, the
elder woman went to her own room to puzzle anew over her son's letter,
which simply said over again what he had told her over the telephone.

When she had gone Lillian locked the door softly behind her, then
coming over to me, sank down by my bedside and slipped her arm around
me.

"You must be brave, Madge," she said quietly. "Read this through and
tell me if you have any idea what it means."

I took the letter she held out to me, and read it through.

"Dear Lil," the letter began. "You have never failed me yet, so I know
you'll look after things for me now.

"I am going away. I shall never see Madge again, nor do I ever expect
to hear from her. Will you look out for her until she is free from me?
She can sue me for desertion, you know, and get her divorce. I will
put in no defence.

"Most of her funds are banked in her name, anyway. But for fear she
will not want to use that money I am going to send a check to you each
month for her which you are to use as you see fit, with or without her
knowledge. I am enclosing the key of the studio. The rent is paid a
long ways ahead, and I will send you the money for future payments
and its care. Please have it kept ready for me to walk in at any time.
Mother always goes to Elizabeth's for the holidays, anyway. Keep her
from guessing as long as you can. I'll write to her after she gets to
Elizabeth's.

"I guess that's all. If Madge doesn't understand why I am doing this I
can't help it. But it's the only thing to do. Yours always. DICKY."

The room seemed to whirl around me as I read. Dicky gone forever,
arranging for me to get a divorce! I clung blindly to Lillian as I
moaned: "Oh, what does it mean?"

"Think, Madge, Madge, have you and Dicky had any quarrel lately?"

"Nothing that could be called a quarrel, no," I returned, "and, not
even the shadow of a disagreement since my accident."

"Then," Lillian said musingly, "either Dicky has gone suddenly mad--"

She stopped and looked at me searchingly. "Or what, Lillian," I
pleaded. "Tell me. I am strong enough to stand the truth, but not
suspense."

You swindle a man as much when you sell him a drug of whose action you
are ignorant, and tell him it will protect him from disease, as when
you give him a bit of bread, which you assure him is the body of
Jesus Christ, and then send a plate round for a subscription. You
swindle him as much by these acts as if you picked his pocket, or
obtained money from him under false pretences in any other way; but
you swindle him according to the rules and in an authorised way.

Real Blasphemy

On one of our Sunday walks near London we passed a forlorn and dilapidated
Primitive Methodist Chapel. The windows were a good deal broken and
there was a notice up offering 10/--reward to any one who should
give such information as should lead to the, &c.

Cut in stone over the door was this inscription, and we thought it
as good an example of real blasphemy as we had ever seen:
When God makes up his last account Of holy children in his mount,
'Twill be an honour to appear As one new born and nourished here.

The English Church Abroad

People say you must not try to abolish Christianity until you have
something better to put in its place.

They might as well say we must not take away turnpikes and corn laws
till we have some other hindrances to put in their place.

Besides no one wants to abolish Christianity--all we want is not to
be snubbed and bullied if we reject the miraculous part of it for
ourselves.

At Biella an English clergyman asked if I was a Roman Catholic. I said,
quite civilly, that I was not a Catholic.

He replied that he had asked me not if I was a Catholic but if I was
a Roman Catholic. What was I? Was I an Anglican Catholic?

So, seeing that he meant to argue, I replied:

"I do not know. I am a Londoner and of the same religion as people
generally are in London."
This made him angry. He snorted:

"Oh, that's nothing at all;" and almost immediately left the
table.

As much as possible I keep away from English-frequented hotels in
Italy and Switzerland because I find that if I do not go to service
on Sunday I am made uncomfortable. It is this bullying that I want
to do away with.

As regards Christianity I should hope and think that I am more
Christian than not.

People ought to be allowed to leave their cards at church, instead of
going inside. I have half a mind to try this next time I am in a
foreign hotel among English people.

Drunkenness

When we were at Shrewsbury the other day, coming up the Abbey Foregate,
we met a funeral and debated whether or not to take our hats off. We
always do in Italy, that is to say in the country and in villages
and small towns, but we have been told that it is not the custom
to do so in large towns and in cities, which raises a question as
to the exact figure that should be reached by the population of a
place before one need not take off one's hat to a funeral in one
of its streets.

At Shrewsbury seeing no one doing it we thought it might look singular
and kept ours on. My friend Mr. Phillips, the tailor, was in one
carriage, I did not see him, but he saw me and afterwards told me
he had pointed me out to a clergyman who was in the carriage with
him.

"Oh," said the clergyman, "then that's the man who says England owes all
her greatness to intoxication."
This is rather a free translation of what I did say; but it only shows
how impossible it is to please those who do not wish to be pleased.
Tennyson may talk about the slow sad hours that bring us all things
ill and all good things from evil, because this is vague and
indefinite; but I may not say that, in spite of the terrible
consequences of drunkenness, man's intellectual development would
not have reached its present stage without the stimulus of
alcohol--which I believe to be both perfectly true and pretty
generally admitted-- because this is definite.

I do not think I said more than this and am sure that no one can
detest drunkenness more than I do. {343} It seems to me it will be
wiser in me not to try to make headway at Shrewsbury.

Hell-Fire

If Vesuvius does not frighten those who live under it, is it likely
that Hell-fire should frighten any reasonable person?

I met a traveller who had returned from Hades where he had conversed
with Tantalus and with others of the shades. They all agreed that for
the first six, or perhaps twelve, months they disliked their punishment
very much; but after that, it was like shelling peas on a hot
afternoon in July.

They began by discovering (no doubt long after the fact had been
apparent enough to every one else) that they had not been noticing
what they were doing so much as usual, and that they had been even
thinking of something else.

From this moment, the automatic stage of action having set in, the
progress towards always thinking of something else was rapid and
they soon forgot that they were undergoing any punishment.

Tantalus did get a little something not infrequently; water stuck
to the hairs of his body and he gathered it up in his hand; he
also got many an apple when the wind was napping as it had to do
sometimes.

Perhaps he could have done with more, but he got enough to
keep him going quite comfortably.

His sufferings were nothing as compared with those of a needy heir
to a fortune whose father, or whoever it may be, catches a dangerous
bronchitis every winter but invariably recovers and lives to 91,
while the heir survives him a month having been worn out with long
expectation.

Sisyphus had never found any pleasure in life comparable to the delight
of seeing his stone bound down-hill, and in so timing its rush as
to inflict the greatest possible scare on any unwary shade who might
be wandering below. He got so great and such varied amusement out
of this that his labour had become the automatism of reflex
action--which is, I understand, the name applied by men of science
to all actions that are done without reflection.

He was a pompous, ponderous old gentleman, very irritable and always
thinking that the other shades were laughing at him or trying to
take advantage of him.

There were two, however, whom he hated with a fury that tormented him
far more seriously than anything else ever did.

The first of these was Archimedes who had instituted a series of
experiments in regard to various questions connected with mechanics
and had conceived a scheme by which he hoped to utilise the motive power
of the stone for the purpose of lighting Hades with electricity. The
other was Agamemnon, who took good care to keep out of the stone's
way when it was more than a quarter of the distance up the slope,
but who delighted in teasing Sisyphus so long as he considered it
safe to do so.

Many of the other shades took daily pleasure in gathering together about
stone-time to enjoy the fun and to bet on how far the stone would
roll.

As for Tityus--what is a bird more or less on a body that covers nine
acres? He found the vultures a gentle stimulant to the liver without
which it would have become congested.

Sir Isaac Newton was intensely interested in the hygrometric and
barometric proceedings of the Danaids.

"At any rate," said one of them to my informant, "if we really are
being punished, for goodness' sake don't say anything about it or
we may be put to other work.

You see, we must be doing something, and now we know how to do this,
we don't want the bother of learning something new. You may be
right, but we have not got to make our living by it, and what in
the name of reason can it matter whether the sieves ever get full
or not?"

My traveller reported much the same with regard to the eternal happiness
on Mount Olympus. Hercules found Hebe a fool and could never get her
off his everlasting knee. He would have sold his soul to find
another AEgisthus.

So Jove saw all this and it set him thinking.

"It seems to me," said he, "that Olympus and Hades are both failures."

Then he summoned a council and the whole matter was thoroughly
discussed.

In the end Jove abdicated, and the gods came down from Olympus
and assumed mortality. They had some years of very enjoyable Bohemian
existence going about as a company of strolling players at French and
Belgian town fairs; after which they died in the usual way, having
discovered at last that it does not matter how high up or how low
down you are, that happiness and misery are not absolute but depend
on the direction in which you are tending and consist in a progression
towards better or worse, and that pleasure, like pain and like
everything that grows, holds in perfection but a little moment.

XXII--RECONCILIATION

Religion

By religion I mean a living sense that man proposes and God disposes,
that we must watch and pray that we enter not into temptation, that
he who thinketh he standeth must take heed lest he fall, and the
countless other like elementary maxims which a man must hold as he holds
life itself if he is to be a man at all.

If religion, then, is to be formulated and made tangible to the people,
it can only be by means of symbols, counters and analogies, more
or less misleading, for no man professes to have got to the root of the
matter and to have seen the eternal underlying verity face to
face--and even though he could see it he could not grip it and hold
it and convey it to another who has not.

Therefore either these feelings must be left altogether unexpressed
and, if unexpressed, then soon undeveloped and atrophied, or they
must be expressed by the help of images or idols--by the help of
something not more actually true than a child's doll is to a child,
but yet helpful to our weakness of understanding, as the doll no
doubt gratifies and stimulates the motherly instinct in the child.

Therefore we ought not to cavil at the visible superstition and
absurdity of much on which religion is made to rest, for the unknown
can never be satisfactorily rendered into the known.

To get the known from the unknown is to get something out of nothing,
a thing which, though it is being done daily in every fraction of
every second everywhere, is logically impossible of conception, and we
can only think by logic, for what is not in logic is not in thought.
So that the attempt to symbolise the unknown is certain to involve
inconsistencies and absurdities of all kinds and it is childish to
complain of their existence unless one is prepared to advocate the
stifling of all religious sentiment, and this is like trying to
stifle hunger or thirst.

To be at all is to be religious more or less. There never was any man
who did not feel that behind this world and above it and about it
there is an unseen world greater and more incomprehensible than
anything he can conceive, and this feeling, so profound and so
universal, needs expression.

If expressed it can only be so by the help of inconsistencies and
errors. These, then, are not to be ordered impatiently out of court;
they have grown up as the best guesses at truth that could be made
at any given time, but they must become more or less obsolete as
our knowledge of truth is enlarged. Things become known which were
formerly unknown and, though this brings us no nearer to ultimate
universal truth, yet it shows us that many of our guesses were
wrong.

Everything that catches on to realism and naturalism as much as
Christianity does must be affected by any profound modification in our
views of realism and naturalism.

God and Convenience

I do not know or care whether the expression "God" has scientific
accuracy or no, nor yet whether it has theological value; I know
nothing either of one or the other, beyond looking upon the recognised
exponents both of science and theology with equal distrust; but for
convenience, I am sure that there is nothing like it--I mean for
convenience of getting quickly at the right or wrong of a matter.

While you are fumbling away with your political economy or your
biblical precepts to know whether you shall let old Mrs.

So- and-so have 5/--or no, another, who has just asked himself which
would be most well-pleasing in the sight of God, will be told in a
moment that he should give her--or not give her--the 5/--. As a general
rule she had better have the 5/--at once, but sometimes we must
give God to understand that, though we should he very glad to do
what he would have of us if we reasonably could, yet the present
is one of those occasions on which we must decline to do so.

The World

Even the world, so mondain as it is, still holds instinctively and as
a matter of faith unquestionable that those who have died by the
altar are worthier than those who have lived by it, when to die was
duty.

Blasphemy

I begin to understand now what Christ meant when he said that
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost was unforgiveable, while speaking
against the Son of Man might be forgiven.

He must have meant that a man may be pardoned for being unable
to believe in the Christian mythology, but that if he made light
of that spirit which the common conscience of all men, whatever
their particular creed, recognises as divine, there was no hope for
him.

No more there is.

Gaining One's Point

It is not he who gains the exact point in dispute who scores most
in controversy, but he who has shown the most forbearance and the
better temper.

The Voice of Common Sense

It is this, and not the Voice of the Lord, which maketh men to be of
one mind in an house.

But then, the Voice of the Lord is the voice of common sense which is
shared by all that is.

Amendes Honorables

There is hardly an offence so great but if it be frankly apologised
for it is easily both forgiven and forgotten.

There is hardly an offence so small but it rankles if he who has
committed it does not express proportionate regret.

Expressions of regret help genuine regret and induce amendment of
life, much as digging a channel helps water to flow, though it
does not make the water. If a man refuses to make them and habitually
indulges his own selfishness at the expense of what is due to other
people, he is no better than a drunkard or a debauchee, and I have no
more respect for him than I have for the others.

We all like to forgive, and we all love best not those who offend us
least, nor those who have done most for us, but those who make it
most easy for us to forgive them.

So a man may lose both his legs and live for years in health if the
amputation has been clean and skilful, whereas a pea in his boot
may set up irritation which must last as long as the pea is there
and may in the end kill him.

Forgiveness and Retribution

It is no part of the bargain that we are never to commit trespasses.
The bargain is that if we would be forgiven we must forgive them that
trespass against us. Nor again is it part of the bargain that we
are to let a man hob-nob with us when we know him to be a thorough
blackguard, merely on the plea that unless we do so we shall not
be forgiving him his trespasses.

No hard and fast rule can be laid down, each case must be settled
instinctively as it arises.

"I do not know," I said faintly. "He left the city very abruptly
several weeks ago, sending word in a letter to Mrs. Underwood that he
would never see me again. It is a terrible mystery."

Dr. Pettit muttered something that I knew was a bitter anathema
against Dicky, and then folded his arms tightly across his chest, as
if he would keep in any further comment. But I had no time to pay
any attention to him, for Katherine Sonnot was uttering words that
bewildered and terrified me.

"Oh! how terrible!" she said. "Jack will be so grieved. He had so
hoped to find you happy together when he came home."

Was the girl's brain turned, I wondered, because of grief for my
brother-cousin's death? I had known before I secured the chance for
her to go to France that she was romantically interested in the man
who had been her brother's comrade, although she had never seen
him. And from Jack's letters to Mrs. Stewart, I had learned of their
meeting in the French hospital, and of the acquaintance which promised
to ripen--which evidently had ripened--into love.

I looked at her searchingly, and then I spoke, hardly able to get the
words out for the wild trembling of my whole body.

"Jack grieved?" I said. "Why! Jack is dead! We had the notice of his
death weeks ago from his friend, Paul Caillard."

I saw them all look at me as if frightened. Dr. Pettit reached me
first and put something under my nostrils which vitalized my wandering
senses. I straightened myself and cried out peremptorily.

"What is it, oh! what is it?"

I saw Katherine look at Dr. Pettit, as if for permission, and the
young physician's lips form the words, "Tell her."

"No, dear. Jack isn't dead," she said softly. "He was missing for some
time, and was brought into our hospital terribly wounded, but he is
very much alive now, and will be here in New York in two weeks."

I felt the pungent revivifier in Dr. Pettit's hand steal under my
nostrils again, but I pushed it aside and sat up.

"I am not at all faint," I said abruptly, and then to Katherine
Sonnot. "Please say that over again, slowly."

She repeated her words slowly. "I should have waited to come over with
him," she added, "for he is still quite weak, but Dr. Braithwaite
had to send some one over to attend to business for the hospital. He
selected me, and so I had to come on earlier."

So it was true, then, this miracle of miracles, this return of the
dead to life! Jack, the brother-cousin on whom I had depended all my
life, was still in the same world with me! Some of the terrible burden
I had been bearing since Dicky's disappearance slipped away from me.
If anyone in the world could solve the mystery of Dicky's actions, it
would be Jack Bickett.

Dr. Pettit's voice broke into my reverie. I saw that Lillian and
Katherine Sonnot were deep in conversation. The young physician and I
were far enough away from them so that there was no possibility of
his low tones being heard. He bent over my chair, and his eyes were
burning with a light that terrified me.

"Tell me," he commanded, "do you want your husband back again. Take
your time in answering. I must know."

There was something in his voice that compelled obedience. I leaned
back in my chair and shut my eyes, while I looked at the question he
had put me fairly and squarely.

The question seemed to echo in my ears. I was surprised at myself that
I did not at once reply with a passionate affirmative. Surely I had
suffered enough to welcome Dicky's return at any time.

Ah! there was the root of the whole thing. I had suffered, how I had
suffered at Dicky's hands! As my memory ran back through our stormy
married life, I wondered whether it were wise--even though it should
be proved to me that Dicky had not gone away with Grace Draper--to
take up life with my husband again.

And then, woman-like, all the bitter recollections were shut out by
other memories which came thronging into my brain, memories of Dicky's
royal tenderness when he was not in a bad humor, of his voice, his
smile, his lips, his arms around me, I knew, although my reason
dreaded the knowledge, that unless my husband came back to me, I
should never know happiness again.

I opened my eyes and looked steadily at the young physician.

"Yes, God help me. I do!" I said.

Dr. Pettit winced as if I had struck him. Then he said gravely:

"Thank you for your honesty, and believe that if there be any way in
which I can serve you, I shall not hesitate to take it."

"I am sure of that," I replied earnestly, and the next moment, without
a farewell glance, a touch of my hand, he went over to Katherine, and,
in a voice very different in volume than the suppressed tones of his
conversation to me, I heard him apologize to her for having to go away
at once, heard her laughing reply that after the French hospitals she
did not fear the New York streets, and then the door had closed after
the young physician, whose too-evident interest in me had always
disturbed me.

I hastened to join Lillian and Katherine. I did not want to be left
alone. Thinking was too painful.

"Just think!" Katherine said as I joined them, "I find that I'm living
only a block away. I'm at my old rooming place--luckily they had
a vacant room. Of course, I shall be fearfully busy with Dr.
Braithwaite's work, but being so near, I can spend every spare minute
with you--that is, if you want me," she added shyly.

"Want you, child!" I returned, and I think the emphasis in my voice
reassured her, for she flushed with pleasure, and the next minute with
embarrassment as I said pointedly:

"I imagine you have some unusually interesting and pleasant things to
tell me, especially about my cousin."

But, after all, it was left for Jack himself to tell me the
"interesting things." Katherine became almost at once so absorbed in
the work for Dr. Braithwaite that she had very little time to spend
with us. There was another reason for her absence, of which she spoke
half apologetically one night, about a week after her arrival.

Above Andromeda, a small towards the right, lies Perseus, Algol
state almost exactly towards the direction and tierce of the way from
the nadir towards the horizon( because tierce of the way from the
centre towards the circumference of the function). about precisely in
the zenith is the star[delta] Aurigæ. The four representation are
illumination of map I., IV., VII., and ten. of my' Constellation
seedtime,' fourth-magnitude stars, nevertheless, being omitted. PLATES
II., III., IV., and V., illustrating section II., III., IV., and V.
baffle II. and IV. contain four star-maps. They not only serve to
bespeak the configuration of certain significant star-groups, but they
exemplify the construction of maps, such as the observer should
break for himself when he wishes to obtain an accurate mind of
particular part of the sky.

They are all made to one index, and on the conical projection--the
simplest and worst of all prediction for chart of this sort. The
manner in which the meridians and similarity for this moneymaker
are laid down is described in my' Handbook of the binary.' With a
big pattern a few minutes will suffice for sweeping away the
equidistant circular discharge which tag the similarity and ruling
in the square acme.

The dotted chorus across three of the representation correspond
a relation of the vertical circle midway between the zenith and the
horizon at the hr at which the map is supposed to be used. At other
shift, of class, this argumentation would be otherwise situated.
home III. and V. correspond fifty-two of the whole mentioned
in the above-named chapters. As mention is made to these person
in the text, little ad-lib is hither required.

It is to be remarked, however, that the ellipse, and particularly
the large ellipse, do not correspond the whole of the telescope's
tract of view, only a large relation of it. The goal of these
soma is to disable the observer to ignore what to anticipate when he
turns his telescope towards a easy single binary.

Many of the objects depicted are really difficult badminton: these are
yield as objects of reference. The observer having seen the
correspondence between an difficult single and its picture, as
respects the possession between the formation hit the constituent and
the apparent path of the bivalent across the collimator's field of
futurism, will cognize how to interpret the picture of a hard
bivalent in this stature.
Then the voices grew louder, there was
a rush of feet to the door, a "Hush!" from Lillian, and then, pale,
emaciated, showing the effects of the terrible ordeal through which he
had gone, my brother-cousin, Jack Bickett, who, until Katherine came
home, I had thought was dead, stood before me.

"Oh! Jack, Jack. Thank God! Thank God!"

As I saw my brother-cousin, Jack Bickett, whom I had so long mourned
as dead, coming toward me in Lillian Underwood's living room, I
stumbled to my feet, and, with no thought of spectators, or of
anything save the fact that the best friend I had ever known had come
back to me, I rushed into his arms, and clung to him wildly, sobbing
out all the heartache and terror that had been mine since Dicky had
left me in so cruel and mysterious a manner.

I felt as a little child might that had been lost and suddenly caught
sight of its father or mother. HENRY T. CHEEVER'S _Life in the
Sandwich Islands_ (noticed by us lately in the _International_),
is reprinted in London, by Bentley, and translated in German for a
publisher at Berlin.

SILVIO PELLICO, so famous for his works, his imprisonments and
sufferings, is passing the winter in Paris.

The complete works of CLEMENS BRENTANO, have been brought out at
Frankfort, in seven volumes.

Two books of travels in Scandinavia have just appeared in Germany.
One is the _Bilder aus dem Norden_ (Pictures of the North), by Professor
OSCAR SCHMIDT of Jena; and the other _Hägringar_, or a Journey
through Sweden, Lapland, Norway, and Denmark, in 1850, by a young
author.

Professor Schmidt amply repays the reader, which is more than can
always be said of the author of _Hägringar_.

Both works are, however, especially worthy the attention of those who
wish to study the natural history and ethnography of the countries in
question.

MADAME VON WEBER, widow of the composer, who has for some years resided
at Vienna, has applied to the Emperor of Austria for permission to
dispose of the three original MSS. scores of her husband's operas,
_Der Freischütz, Eutryanthe_, and _Oberon_.

These were in the Royal Library at Vienna; and she purposes offering
them to the three sovereigns of Saxony, Prussia, and England,--in
which respective countries they were originally produced.

The Emperor has caused the MSS. to be delivered to her.

PROFESSOR NUYTZ, whose work on canon law was recently condemned by the
Holy See, has resumed his lectures at Turin. The lecture-room was
crowded, and the learned professor was received with loud applause.
He adverted to the hostility of the clergy, and to the Papal
censures of his work, which censures he declared to be in direct
opposition to the rights of the civil power.

He expressed his thanks to the ministry for having refused to
deprive him of his chair.

A valuable contribution to Italian history is _Die Carafa von Maddaloni,
Neapel unter Spanische Herrschaft_ (Naples under Spanish Domination),
just published in Germany, by ALFRED VON REUMONT, a member of the
Prussian Legation at Florence, who, more than almost any other man,
has made a study of the history of that part of Italy, and who in
this work has had access to a great mass of new documents.

He writes as a monarchist, but his facts may be relied on.

The work is in two volumes.

Every body remembers the noise made in New-York some fifteen years
since by the revelations of MARIA MONK.

We notice a translation of her famous disclosures advertised, with all

An edition of the complete works of KEPLER is preparing in Germany,
under the supervision of Prof. FRISCH, of Stuttgart. The manuscripts
of the great astronomer, preserved at St. Petersburg, have been
examined for the purpose, with rich results. It is also proposed to
erect a monument to Kepler at Stuttgart.

Sixteen German books were prohibited in Russia in August last; among
them were FONTAINE'S _Poems_, GÖRRE'S _Christian Mysticism_, KUTZ'S
_Manual of Sacred History_, SCHMIDT'S _Death of Lord Byron_, KINKEL'S
_Truth without Poetry_, and STRAUSS'S _Life Questions_.

Of eleven other works, a few pages from each were prohibited; among
these was the German version of Lieutenant LYNCH'S _United States
Expedition to the Jordan and the Dead Sea_. These works are allowed
to enter Russia after having the objectionable pages cut out.he
persisted. "How do you know?"

"Because no one saw him," I returned, "and he could hardly have come
back without someone in the house seeing him."

He said no more, as Lillian and Katherine came up just then, and the
conversation became general.

To my great surprise, I did not see him again after that first visit.
Katherine explained to me that he had been called out of town on
urgent business, but the explanation seemed to me to savor of the
mysterious excitement that seemed to possess everybody around me.

Finally one morning, Lillian came to me, her face shining.

"I want you to prepare to be very brave, Madge," she said. "There is
some one coming whom I fear it will tax all your strength to meet."

"Dicky!" I faltered, beginning to tremble.

"No, child, not yet," she said, her voice filled with pity, "but
someone who has done you a great wrong, Grace Draper."


XLIII

"TAKE ME HOME"


"Grace Draper coming to see me!"

My echo of Lillian's words was but a trembling stammer. The prospect
of facing the girl the thread of whose sinister personality had so
marred the fabric of my marital happiness terrified me. Her message
to me, posted in San Francisco, where Dicky was, flaunted its insolent
triumph again before my eyes:

"She laughs best who laughs last."

That she had intended me to believe she was with Dicky, I knew,
whether her boast were true or not. But how was it that she was coming
to see me? Lillian put a reassuring hand upon my shoulder as she saw
my face.

"Pull yourself together, Madge," she admonished me sharply. "Let me
make this clear to you. Grace Draper is not in San Francisco now.
Whether she has been, or what she knows about Dicky she has refused so
far to say. She has finally consented to see you, however."

"But, how?" I murmured, bewildered.

"Do you remember the girl of whom Katherine spoke when she first came,
the girl who moaned at night in the room next hers?"

"Oh, yes! And she was--?"

"Grace Draper. I do not know what made me think of the Draper when
Katherine spoke of the girl, but I did, although I said nothing about
it at the time. A little later, however, when the girl became really
ill and Katherine was caring for her as a mother or a sister would
have done, I told our little friend of my suspicion. I have often
seen with pleasure the surprise with which the performance even of
an opera-glass, well steadied, and directed towards certain parts
of the heavens, has been witnessed by those who have supposed that
nothing but an expensive and colossal telescope could afford any
views of interest.

But a well-constructed achromatic of two or three inches in aperture
will not merely supply amusement and instruction,--it may be made
to do useful work.

The student of astronomy is often deterred from telescopic observation
by the thought that in a field wherein so many have laboured, with
abilities and means perhaps far surpassing those he may possess,
he is little likely to reap results of any utility.

He argues that, since the planets, stars, and nebulæ have been scanned
by Herschel and Rosse, with their gigantic mirrors, and at Pulkova
and Greenwich with refractors whose construction has taxed to the
utmost the ingenuity of the optician and mechanic, it must be
utterly useless for an unpractised observer to direct a telescope
of moderate power to the examination of these objects.

Now, passing over the consideration that a small telescope may afford
its possessor much pleasure of an intellectual and elevated character,
even if he is never able by its means to effect original discoveries,
two arguments may be urged in favour of independent telescopic
observation. In the first place, the student who wishes to appreciate
the facts and theories of astronomy should familiarize himself with the
nature of that instrument to which astronomers have been most largely
indebted.

In the second place, some of the most important discoveries in
astronomy have been effected by means of telescopes of moderate
power used skilfully and systematically.

One instance may suffice to show what can be done in this way. The
well-known telescopist Goldschmidt (who commenced astronomical
observation at the age of forty-eight, in 1850) added fourteen asteroids
to the solar system, not to speak of important discoveries of nebulæ
and variable stars, by means of a telescope only five feet in focal
length, mounted on a movable tripod stand.

The feeling experienced by those who look through a telescope for the
first time,--especially if it is directed upon a planet or nebula--is
commonly one of disappointment.

They have been told that such and such powers will exhibit Jupiter's
belts, Saturn's rings, and the continent-outlines on Mars; yet,
though perhaps a higher power is applied, they fail to detect these
appearances, and can hardly believe that they are perfectly
distinct to the practised eye.

The expectations of the beginner are especially liable to disappointment
in one particular. He forms an estimate of the view he is to obtain
of a planet by multiplying the apparent diameter of the planet by
the magnifying power of his telescope, and comparing the result
with the apparent diameter of the sun or moon.

Let us suppose, for instance, that on the day of observation
Jupiter's apparent diameter is 45", and that the telescopic power
applied is 40, then in the telescope Jupiter should appear to have a
diameter of 1800", or half a degree, which is about the same as
the moon's apparent diameter. But when the observer looks through the
telescope he obtains a view--interesting, indeed, and instructive--but
very different from what the above calculation would lead him to
expect.

He sees a disc apparently much smaller than the
moon's, and not nearly so well-defined in outline; in a line with
the disc's centre there appear three or four minute dots of light,
the satellites of the planet; and, perhaps, if the weather is
favourable and the observer watchful, he will be able to detect
faint traces of belts across the planet's disc.

"But you must believe this one thing,--I had made
up my mind to come back and beg your forgiveness, indeed, I was just
ready to start for New York, when your cousin found me and brought me
the true explanation of things.

"I--I--couldn't stand it any longer without you, Madge. I must have
been mad to go away like that. You won't shut me out altogether, will
you, sweetheart?"

I had thought that if Dicky ever came back me I should make him suffer
a little of what he had compelled me to endure. But, as I looked
from the white, drawn face of the girl, who I was sure still counted
Dicky's love as a stake for which no wager was too high, to the
anxious faces of the dear friends who had helped to bring him back to
me, I could do nothing but yield myself rapturously to the clasp of my
husband's arms.

"I couldn't have stood it much longer without you, Dicky," I
whispered, and then, forgetting everything else in the world but
our happiness, my husband's lips met mine in a long kiss of
reconciliation.

A half choked little cry startled me, and I saw Grace Draper get
to her feet unsteadily and start for the door, with her hands
outstretched gropingly before her, almost as if she were blind.
Katherine Sonnot hurried to her, and then Jack spoke to me for the
first time since he had brought Dicky into the room.

Clark went to meet them as they came in. He hugged the gaunt
Lieutenant with genuine fervor of joy, while Oncle Jazon ran around
them making a series of grotesque capers.

The whole command, hearing Oncle Jazon's patriotic words, set up a
wild shouting on the spur of a general impression that Beverley came
as a messenger bearing glorious news from Washington's army in the
east.

It was a great relief to Clark when he found out that his favorite
Lieutenant had not broken his parole; but had instead boldly resurrendered
himself, declaring the obligation no longer binding, and notifying
Hamilton of his intention to go away with the purpose of returning and
destroying him and his command.
"Will you come away with me for a new honeymoon, sweetheart?" A small
large field of view, and is adjusted so room as to have its telescope
called a_finder_ is usually whenever attached to all Dicky powerful
telescopes intended for general observation.

The finder has a axis analogue to that of the telescope.
I turned to Dicky with a passionate little plea.

"Oh! Dicky," I said earnestly, "take me home."
