Thus the British had the priceless
advantage of a movable naval base at hand, while the
Americans had none at all within supporting distance.
Every step towards Lake Ontario hampered Izard more and
more, while it added corresponding strength to Drummond.
An American attempt to work round Drummond's flank, twelve
miles inland, was also foiled by a heavy skirmish on
October 19 at Cook's Mills; and Izard's definite abandonment
of the invasion was announced on November 5 by his blowing
up Fort Erie and retiring into winter quarters. This
ended the war along the whole Niagara.

The campaign on Lake Ontario was very different. It opened
two months earlier. The naval competition consisted rather
in building than in fighting. The British built ships in
Kingston, the Americans in Sackett's Harbour; and reports
of progress soon travelled across the intervening space
of less than forty miles. [Footnote 840: This favourite
apple, mentioned by Columella and Pliny, took its name from
C. Matius, a Roman knight, and friend of Augustus, who
first introduced it. Pliny tells us that Matius was
also the first who brought into vogue the practice of
clipping groves.]

[Footnote 843: Suetonius's account of the rude and
unlettered state of society in the early times of Rome, is consistent
with what we might infer, and with the accounts which have come
down to us, of a community composed of the most daring and adventurous
spirits thrown off by the neighbouring tribes, and whose sole
occupations were rapine and war.

But Cicero discovers the germs of mental cultivation among
the Romans long before the period assigned to it by
Suetonius, tracing them to the teaching of Pythagoras,
who visited the Greek cities on the coast of Italy in
the reign of Tarquinius Superbus.--Tusc. Quaest. iv. 1.]

[Footnote 844: Livius, whose cognomen Andronicus,
intimates his extraction, was born of Greek parents.
He began to teach at Rome in the consulship of Claudius
Cento, the son of Appius Caecus, and Sempronius Tuditanus,
A.U.C. 514. He must not be confounded with Titus
Livius, the historian, who flourished in the Augustan
age.]
[Footnote 845: Ennius was a native of Calabria. He was
born the year after the consulship mentioned in the
preceding note, and lived to see at least his
seventy-sixth year, for Gellius informs us that at that age he
wrote the twelfth book of his Annals.]

[Footnote 846: Porcius Cato found Ennius in Sardinia, when
he conquered that island during his praetorship. He
learnt Greek from Ennius there, and brought him to Rome
on his return. Ennius taught Greek at Rome for a long
course of years, having M. Cato among his pupils.]

was the son of Timocrates, a Stoic philosopher, who
for his critical skill had the surname of Homericus.]

the reign of Ptolemy Philometer, whose son he
educated.]

[Footnote 850: Cicero (De Clar. Orat. c. xx., De Senect.

which there are other authorities; but this differs from the account
given in a former note.]The Atlantic being barred by this Great Blockade, and
the Pacific being inaccessible, the only practical way
left open to American trade was through the British lines
by land or sea. Some American seamen shipped in British
vessels. Some American ships sailed under British colours.
But the chief external American trade was done illicitly,
by 'underground,' with the British West Indies and with
Canada itself. This was, of course, in direct defiance
of the American government, and to the direct detriment
of the United States as a nation. It was equally to the
direct benefit of the British colonies in general and of
Nova Scotia in particular. American harbours had never
been so dull. Quebec and Halifax had never been so
prosperous. American money was drained away from the
warlike South and West and either concentrated in the
Northern States--which were opposed to the war--or paid
over into British hands.

Nor was this all. The executive was gained, placing the
army, navy, appointments, and patronage in the hands of
the President, the people's representative by birth and
choice. The North had a majority of eight in the Senate
and sixty-five in the House of Representatives,
insuring a control of the foreign policy and the financial
affairs of the republic; while the Supreme Court, the
last bulwark of despotism, could be reconstructed
in the interest of the Constitution. It is true the
people did not appreciate the magnitude of the victory,
or realize what it implied.
They would probably have made no special use of it at
once, and the aristocracy might have outwitted them
again, as they had for three quarters of a century
past.

But the slaveholders knew that now was just the time to
strike. If they waited till the people understood themselves
better, and learned how to administer the Government
for liberty, it would be too late. They still had
possession of the executive, with all the departments, the Supreme
Court, army, and navy, for four precious months.

This was improved in inflicting as much damage on the
Government as possible, and organizing a confederacy
of revolted States. The people did not believe they would
fight, and offered them various compromises, _everything
except the thing they desired--unlimited power to control
the republic_. The aristocracy knew that no compromises
would do them good which proposed anything less than
a reconstruction of the Union which would insure their
perpetual supremacy. They even doubted if this could be
effectually accomplished in a peaceful way. The people
must first be subdued by arms, their Union destroyed,
and brought to the verge of anarchy by this mighty
power, backed by the whole despotism of Europe; then might
they be compelled to accept such terms as it chose to
dictate. It waited no longer than was necessary to
complete its preparations, and opened ed its guns in
Charleston harbor. When the smoke of that cannonade
drifted away, the people beheld with consternation
the Slave Powers arrayed in arms, from Baltimore and
St.
Louis to New Orleans and the Rio Grande, advancing to seize their
capital and overthrow the republic.

Barney had no choice but to retire before this
overwhelming force. As the British advanced up the
narrowing waters all chance of escape disappeared; so
Barney burnt his boats and little vessels and marched
his seamen in to join Winder's army. On August 24 Winder's
whole six thousand drew up in an exceedingly strong
position at Bladensburg, just north of Washington; and
the President rode out with his Cabinet to see a battle
which is best described by its derisive title of the
Bladensburg Races. Ross's four thousand came on and were
received by an accurate checking fire from the regular
artillery and from Barney's seamen gunners. But a total
loss of 8 killed and 11 wounded was more than the 5,000

He had a fair proportion
of trained seamen; but they consisted of scratch drafts
from different men-of-war, chosen in haste and hurried
to the front. Most of the men and officers were complete
strangers to one another; and they made such short-handed
crews that some soldiers had to be wheeled out of the
line of march and put on board at the very last minute.
There would have been grave difficulties with such a
flotilla under any circumstances. But Prevost had increased
them tenfold by giving no orders and making no preparations
while trying his hand at another abortive armistice--one,
moreover, which he had no authority even to propose.

in the words of Macomb's own official report, 'so undaunted
