[Illustration: "WHAT THE CHILD IMITATES, HE BEGINS TO
UNDERSTAND."--_Froebel._]


PREFACE.


"What the child imitates," says Froebel, "he begins to understand. Let
him represent the flying of birds and he enters partially into the
life of birds. Let him imitate the rapid motion of fishes in the water
and his sympathy with fishes is quickened. Let him reproduce the
activities of farmer, miller and baker, and his eyes open to the
meaning of their work. In one word let him reflect in his play the
varied aspects of life and his thought will begin to grapple with
their significance."

In all times and among all nations, finger-plays have been a delight
of childhood. Countless babies have laughed and crowed over
"Pat-a-cake" and other performances of the soft little hands; while
children of whatever age never fail to find amusement in playing

     "Here is the church,
       And here's the steeple,
     Open the doors,
       And here are the people!"

and others as well known.

Yet it is not solely upon the pleasure derived from them, that
finger-plays depend for their _raison d'etre_. By their judicious and
early use, the development of strength and flexibility in the tiny lax
fingers may be assisted, and dormant thought may receive its first
awakening call through the motions which interpret as well as
illustrate the phase of life or activity presented by the words.

The eighteen finger-plays contained in this book have already, through
publication in BABYLAND, been introduced to their especial public, and
have been much used in homes, though perhaps more in kindergartens. It
will readily be seen that while some of the plays are for the babies
in the nursery, others are more suitable for older children.

A baby-friend, ten months old, plays "All for Baby" throughout,
pounding and clapping gleefully with all his might--while children
seven or eight years of age play and sing "The Caterpillar," "How the
Corn Grew" and others with very evident enjoyment.

With a little study of the charming and expressive pictures with which
the artist, Mr. L.J. Bridgman, has so sympathetically illustrated the
rhymes, mothers and kindergartners have easily understood what motions
were intended. To elucidate still farther, however, the playing of
"The Merry Little Men" may be thus described:

During the singing of the first verse, the children look about in
every direction for the "little men," but keep the hands hidden. At
the beginning of the second verse, raise both hands to full view with
fingers outspread and quiet. At the words, "The first to come," etc.,
let the thumbs be shown alone, then the others as named in turn, till
all are again outspread as at the beginning of the second verse. In
the last verse the arms are moved from side to side, hands being
raised and fingers fluttering nimbly all the time. When displaying the
"busy little men," raise the hands as high as possible.

The music, composed by Miss Cornelia C. Roeske, will be found
melodious and attractive and especially suited to the voices and
abilities of the very young children for whom it is chiefly intended.

The harmonic arrangement is also purposely simple in consideration of
the many mothers and kindergartners who cannot devote time to
preparatory practice.

A little boy went walking
  One lovely summer's day:
He saw a little rabbit
  That quickly ran away;

[Illustration: THE RABBIT [index and middle finger in "V" sign]]

[Illustration: RAN AWAY [same, with arm moving behind back]]

He saw a shining river
  Go winding in and out,
And little fishes in it
  Were swimming all about;

[Illustration: SHINING RIVER [hands describing a long curve]]

[Illustration: THE FISHES [fingers waggling downward]]

And, slowly, slowly turning,
  The great wheel of the mill;
And then the tall church steeple,
  The little church so still;

[Illustration: MILL WHEEL [hands turning over each other]]

[Illustration: CHURCH STEEPLE [hands clasped upward, index fingers

The bridge above the water;
  And when he stopped to rest,
He saw among the bushes
  A wee ground-sparrow's nest.

[Illustration: THE BRIDGE [palms downward, fingers straight and

And as he watched the birdies

  Across the sunny sky.

4. "Well," said Mrs. Pussy then,
     "To the barn we'll go;

6. Home went hungry Mrs. Puss
     And her kittens four;
   Found their dinner on a plate

7. As they gathered round the plate,
     They agreed 'twas nice
   That it could not run away
     Like the birds and mice!

XIV.--HOW THE CORN GREW.


There was a field that waiting lay,
  All hard and brown and bare;
There was a thrifty farmer came
  And fenced it in with care.

[Illustration: THE FIELD. [two children facing each other with their
arms extended onto each other's shoulders]]

Then came a plowman with his plow;
  From early until late,
Across the field and back again,
  He plowed the furrows straight.

[Illustration: THE PLOW. [hands together sideways, thumbs extended
slightly upward]]

The harrow then was brought to make
  The ground more soft and loose;
And soon the farmer said with joy,
  "My field is fit for use."

[Illustration: THE HARROW. [palms downward, fingers curved and

For many days the farmer then
  Was working with his hoe;
And little Johnny brought the corn
  And dropped the kernels--so!

[Illustration: THE HOE. [palm downward, fingers together and bent at

[Illustration: DROPPED THE KERNELS--SO! [palm downward, fingers

And there they lay, until awaked

Then pushed their green plumes up to greet
  The sun they loved so well.

Then flocks and flocks of hungry crows
  Came down the corn to taste;
But ba-ang!--went the farmer's gun
  And off they flew in haste.

Then grew and grew the corn, until,

With sickles keen they cut it down,
  And sang the "Harvest Home."

XV.--THE MILL.


A merry little river
  Went singing day by day,
Until it reached a mill-dam
  That stretched across its way.

[Illustration: THE MILLDAM. [hand sideways, fingers straight]]

And there it spread its waters,
  A quiet pond, to wait
Until the busy miller
  Should lift the water-gate.

[Illustration: LIFT THE WATER-GATE. [hands sideways, bent at knuckles,

Then, hurrying through the gateway,
  The dashing waters found
A mighty millwheel waiting,
  And turned it swiftly round.

[Illustration: THE MILLWHEEL. [hands turning over one another]]

But faster turned the millstones
  Up in the dusty mill,
And quickly did the miller
  With corn the hopper fill.

[Illustration: THE MILLSTONES. [palms downward, fingers straight, one
hand moving in a circle on top of the other]]

And faster yet and faster
  The heavy stones went round,
Until the golden kernels
  To golden meal were ground.

"Now fill the empty hopper
  With _wheat_," the miller said;
"We'll grind this into flour
  To make the children's bread."

[Illustration: THE HOPPER. [hands cupped together]]

And still, as flowed the water,
  The mighty wheel went round;
And still, as turned the millstones,
  The corn and grain were ground.

And busy was the miller
  The livelong day, until
The water-gate he fastened,
  And silent grew the mill.

[Illustration: XVI. MAKING BREAD.]

XVI.--MAKING BREAD.


"The farmer and the miller
Have worked," the mother said,
"And got the flour ready,
So I will make the bread."
It is for this reason that I
devote my next chapter
chiefly to the stocking of
waters with food and to the improvement of the food supply in
waters where some food already exists.

CHAPTER II

STOCKING WATERS WITH FOOD

It may seem somewhat
superfluous to say that
fish cannot live in any
water unless that water
contains the food supply
necessary for them to thrive
upon, and yet this is the
point most often overlooked in stocking waters with fish.

Small attempts at stocking with creatures suitable for food,
particularly after the fish have been already introduced, are not
at all likely to succeed.

Such an important matter when treated as a small afterthought is
almost sure to end in failure of the whole business of stocking.

But a small amount of thought will convince any one that in order
that there may be a sufficient amount of animal life in a water,
there must be an adequate vegetable life, for weeds are almost
always necessary to the well-being of the creatures which serve as
food for fishes.

In the case of a pond it is generally fairly easy to introduce a
good stock of suitable weeds.

The best method is to let the pond down as low as possible, and
then to plant some weeds round the margin; the water is then allowed
to gradually fill up the pond, and as it rises weeds are planted
round the rising margin of the water.

In ponds which cannot be
emptied at all, or not
sufficiently to carry
out this plan, weeds may be
planted in an easy but not quite
so effectual a manner. They may
be planted in shallow
baskets containing some mud from the bottom of the pond, and then
lowered in suitable places from a boat, or bundles of the weed may
be tied to stones and dropped into the water in a similar manner.

These latter methods are, of course, not so good as actually planting
the weeds round the advancing margin of the water, for success
depends to a certain extent upon chance.

Some of the weeds thus planted are, however, sure to take root and
grow.

Plants of different kinds, of course, are necessary at different
depths and on different kinds of bottoms, and good kinds are necessary
at the margin of the water as well.

I give a list of some suitable plants of each kind at the end of
this chapter.

Similar methods are used in planting weeds in rivers and streams
to those used in ponds.

If the weeds are planted in
     baskets, the baskets must, of
   course, be weighted when
     put in a position where the
   current can act upon them.
     
   Besides vegetation in the
     water, vegetation on the bank is of considerable importance.

I shall deal with this at a
     later period more fully,
   as trees and bushes, besides
     harbouring many insects
   which serve as food for
     fish, have also considerable
   importance in giving cover
     to the fish and to the fisherman who is pursuing them.

I think that in the case of a
     bare water, a year at least
   should be devoted to
     developing a good supply of
   vegetation. This will generally
     produce a considerable amount of
   animal life, without any
     artificial help, but judicious help will be sure to accelerate
matters to a considerable extent.

  Skim, skim, skim,
     With the skimmer bright;
   Take the rich and yellow cream,
     Leave the milk so white.]

2. Churn, churn, churn,
     Now 'tis churning day;
   Till the cream to butter turn
     Dasher must not stay.

3. Press, press, press;
     All the milk must be
   From the golden butter now
     Pressed out carefully.

4. Pat, pat, pat,
     Make it smooth and round.
   See! the roll of butter's done--
     Won't you buy a pound?

5. Taste, oh! taste,
     This is very nice.
   Spread it on the children's bread,
     Give them each a slice.
