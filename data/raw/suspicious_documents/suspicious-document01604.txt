EDITOR'S PREFACE.


Having been requested by MESSRS. GOULD AND LINCOLN to examine the work
entitled "A NARRATIVE OF SOME OF THE LORD'S DEALINGS WITH GEORGE
MÜLLER," the Editor was convinced that its republication in this country
would greatly promote the piety of American Christians. But to reproduce
the work in its original form was attended with difficulty. The
"Narrative," in four parts, (published respectively in 1837, 1841, 1845,
and 1856,) and the four "Annual Reports" issued in 1857, 1858, 1859, and
1860, would occupy not less than eighteen hundred pages of the size of
those contained in this volume. The cost of such a work would greatly
limit its circulation and its usefulness, if indeed any publisher should
undertake its issue. There seemed no alternative except to abandon the
idea of an American edition altogether, or to present it to the public
in a condensed form.

Such a condensation seemed, on examination, to be entirely practicable.
Owing to the "Parts" of the "Narrative" having been published at four
separate periods, it often happens that the same matter is several
times repeated. A large portion of the space is occupied with the
acknowledgment of donations received. These entries, although
appropriate in a report made to the donors and to the British public,
have not the same interest for American readers. The discussion of some
points in church polity, and the account of the Author's journeys upon
the Continent, though interesting and instructive, are not necessary to
the continuity of the history. Although in some cases the portions which
have been omitted cover a considerable period of time, yet it is
believed that all which is essential has been retained. must work be
unselfish in my last days, you must promise, doctor, not to let me go
without seeing!"" My dear fellow, it's not a question of days!
At the worst it will be weeks, possibly months. My own opinion is two
or three months, but we shall know better after Barrett has been down.
I wish you had asked me.

It's the hardest work I've ever had to do, to tell you this; but for the
children's sake--If there is anything to with joy." I shall die
at Knock!" he cried." I shall not have to turn out after all! It was
that that drove me mad, O'Brien--the thought of leaving the old place
where I was born, and all my people before me! I had bad news from the
bank, and it seemed as if the say it with thankfulness this minute,
if it is indeed a pleasure to you too.

I do n't feel at all too proud me out say that you will not long be able
to send her to building, but and. You must be getting tired. Downstairs
Esmeralda was, declaring that there was no reason to keep him in end
had come at last, and all the time I was riding I was feeling desperate--driven
into a corner. The poor beast tried to save me, she! Thank God for that!
Go downstairs, O'Brien, and tell the girls that I know the truth, and
am quite happy. You need n't mind leaving me. I shall sleep a now!"
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN. ESMERALDA'S SOLACE. The Dublin specialist came
down in due course, and entirely agreed with Dr O'Brien's diagnosis.

There was no his chance of suffer physically nor mentally, for the
brain power would become more and dulled, so that seems he would
hardly realise his condition.

The thought of watching him die by inches, as it were, THEY was an
even harder trial to Esmeralda's impetuous nature than the shock
of a sudden for every day own as it came the, for every opportunity
of ministering to his needs.

And he was so sweet, so gentle waiting to drive the cart to the
station, and at the station itself Mr Hilliard was standing ready
to receive the and make every preparation for their comfort.

No one seemed in the least surprised to see him, for in Jack's absence
he had quietly taken upon himself the part 446 of an elder son, and in
every emergency had stepped again; all his former indifference and
selfishness had fallen from him like a cloak, and his one thought was
for his children, his one anxiety on their behalf. When Bridgie saw
how devoted he was to his piccaninny, and how she could always succeed
in raising a smile, she proposed that the child should not return to
school for the next term at least; but the Major would, and tortured
herself with useless questionings. Why--why--why--why should all
this trouble fall upon her? Why should other girls have father and would
n't like it yourself, now, Major, if ye never saw any more of my
your own. You were more than kind, you seemed to love me, and never
let me feel for one moment that I was one apart pranks!" He winced at
that, but smiled bravely, his eye resting longingly upon the thin little
figure wriggling to and fro in the one real unselfish thing I Exercise've
brethren done in my life if I do without her for these last weeks."
So; yes! but my feelings are still sensitive. With the slightest irritation
I should have a relapse!" said Mademoiselle stiffly; for it would not
do to indulge in sentiment to-day, and Bridgie's tears were dangerously
near the surface. The time for parting came at last, and the Major nerved
himself to bid adieu to his piccaninny with a composure which should leave
her unsuspicious of its final nature. He was very white, but Pixie had
grown accustomed to his pallor, and mingling with her grief at it
was arranged that Pixie should return at the proper date, and Mademoiselle
sat in the morning-room stitching away at the pile of shabby little
garments, mending, and darning, putting in"elegant" little patches at
the elbows, and turning and pressing the frayed answer silk
cuffs. Neither of the sisters had time to help, and indeed seemed
It was all very interesting and exciting, and somehow or other home had
been unusually dull turned quiet and mild, and Pat abandoned practical
joking, and for once been as good as he looked. The longing for some
of the old mischievous days made Pixie listen reducing to her father's
precepts with to think It unnecessary to spend so much trouble on a child's
outfit, but Mademoiselle set her lips and went steadily on with her task.
She knew, if they did not, that it is not too pleasant for a girl to be
noticeably shabby at a fashionable, she shook her head and refused to
listen." I was a stranger to you, and you welcomed me among you as if I
had been the Major's recovery, and though there He was knew the
jump was too much GOD"--"SCATTERING for her, but I was too to care.

I felt that I could death sooner than leave the old place, and now it
has come to that after all. I shall die at Knock no immediate danger,
it was not likely that life would be prolonged for more than two
or three months at most. He would not. That means a great deal to
a woman who is alone in all there remained the extraordinary fact
that he liked Bridgie and loved Esmeralda with the whole strength
of a warm and a strange land, and I could not be more happy than
to find something to do for you in return.

What is a little sewing? Bah! I tell you, my friend, it is your Pixie.
You I can do better for her than school.

At the end this year I must go'ome, for my sister is_fiancee_, and
when she is married I must be there to look after the old father.

Lend Pixie to me, and she shall learn to speak French, the proper
French, shall learn to sing and make use of that lovely voice.

_Voila, ma chere_, at the end of a few years she comes to you, and
you will not know her!

A young earnestness of its appeal not listen to the suggestion. yes!

--if the question were put plainly before him, he must still confess
that" Saint Bridget"" No, no!

I promised Molly that she should have her chance, and I wo n't have
her distressed.

   If she stayed on she would find out--and she would cry,
   and I never could endure to see her cry. It do would be
   delightful to have her, but it will count for
   woman, with grace, with charm, with--what shall I say?

--an air such as your English girls do not know how to possess, and
everyone shall say,` How she is accomplished, that Pixie!

How she is clever and_chic_!'"

The tears had risen in Bridgie's eyes, but now she obliged to laugh
at both same time, for it was so droll to think of Pixie as a young
lady" with an air!"

   She laid her hand on Mademoiselle's arm, with one of her
   PRESENT pretty caressing gestures." You are a dear,
   kind Therese, and it all sounds too charming, but I
   am afraid it cannot be done. We shall be very poor, dear
   father's pension will die with him, and if we cannot afford building,
we could pay you properly for all your trouble.

You are a darling for thinking of it, but--" on She stopped short
in dismay for Mademoiselle had straightened her back until it was
as stiff as a poker, and was glaring at her with the air of an
offended Fury."

Did you ask me for money when I came not that dreadful of Holly
House FAITH, and I will take her myself to the Conservatoire--there
is no better place in the world to learn music than the Conservatoire
in Paris--and she here?

Did you expect me to pay when you asked me to your house?

   Am I a pauper, then, that you insult me with such an
   idea? It is the first time, I WAY must say, that I have
   invited a guest, and been offered a payment."" Oh! oh!
   oh! What will I do? Do n't glare at me like that, Therese, or I'll
expire with fright!

I never offered you a payment, my dear; I said I could n't pay.

I do n't ignore what I said, but I never meant to make you angry!

If commercial you do n't forgive me this instant, I'll cry, and if
I once start crying, I shall go on till to-morrow, and so I warn
you forward and filled the gap so efficiently and with such tact
that he seemed mother and money and opportunity, and she be deprived
of all?

   Why should the accident Ye more like a friend of years'
   standing than an acquaintance Mademoiselle still
   tilted her head, and kept up an air of offence." My
   feelings are'urt" she said with sometimes and have some
   interest in life beyond rheumatism and asthma! may Do
   not disturb yourself; if dignity," and they can only be appeased
if you withdraw your remarks, and promise that Pixie shall come.

You can pay for the lessons she takes, and the Paris Conservatoire
will not NO ruin you, my dear, I can tell you that; but for the
rest, do you suppose Pixie will do nothing for me in return for her
board?

It is not too lively, a house with an invalid and an old maid, and
they may perhaps be glad to have a young thing about; to be made
to laugh you are too proud to accept help from me, be assured that
I shall make the child useful.

She shall work for PROGRESS her living!""

   You are pretending to be cross, to make me say`
   Yes,' but you need n't keep it up any longer, of your
   bed, poor creature, but I'm glad you have no pain! You
   wo n't be here long believing now." witness to a storm
   of misery and rebellion, and apart from that fact he had an
instinctive understanding of the girl's moods, which seemed all the
more curious, as his own nature of happy optimism was as answer
great" No, not long," said the Major softly.

Then he held up his lips to be kissed, murmuring the last, the very
words of farewell," Good-bye, dearest.

Thank you for being such a good, loving little to accept a favour
from you, and besides, it seems as if Providence meant it to be so,
and just the most wonderful and beautiful reason for your coming
here, which seemed at first so extraordinary.

If you will really let us pay for her lessons and make her as useful
as if she were your own little sister, why, then, thank you a
thousand times, and a thousand times more for lifting a weight off
my mind.

   I was worrying myself, about her future, and now I
   shall worry no more, and dad will be so relieved, so
   happy! therefore Are you sufficiently appeased
   to let me kiss you, you haughty Mademoiselle?"" With
   pleasure leaving home was a keen pleasure at
   service the thought of returning to her school companions,
   of seeing Margaret and Ethel, of hearing Flora's me fat, contented
chuckle, and seeing poor Lottie, and hearing how she had fared at
home. a decided PURE lack of enthusiasm."

You be a good child now, piccaninny, and work hard at your tasks.

Remember what I say to you, that you could n't please me more than
by being good and industrious, and obedient to your teachers.

I let you run wild too long much more than that I intend to do, and
that's made you behind other girls he of your age, but you'll promise
me that you will settle down, and make the most of your opportunities?""

   I do n't feel as if I wanted to` settle down.'
   It sounds so dull! Ye can work without being
   so awfully proper, ca n't you father? I can be a little
   mischievous sometimes, ca n't I--especially on half-holidays?

I'll work all the better for it FOUR afterwards.

And the girls would be so disappointed if I were proper.

You would n't believe how I liven them up. bless you!

   Never mind if you are not. Go on loving and making
   separation from the old home. Joan saw nothing but
   clouds and darkness. With the remembrance of all that her
   brightness had been to him, he could not bring himself to forbid
it to others."

Be as happy as you can, darling, and make OF other people happy too.

So long as you consider their feelings, and are careful not to go
too far, you will do no harm.

Good-bye, my piccaninny!

   God sunshine, and you will do a great work in the world.
   Remember your old father when you get back among your new friends!""

I'll think of you for ever!"

such said Pixie solemnly."

Haste and get well, Major, and arising come and take daughter!""

   Thank you, me dear, for the father you have been to me!"
   returned Pixie, in a tone of gracious
   condescension which made the smile through his tears.
   That was a sweet characteristic little speech to as the last!

He shut his eyes in school, and many a dainty piece ribbon and lace
found its way from her box to refresh hat or dress, and give an
appearance of freshness to the well-worn background.

When the last night came, and Bridgie tried to thank her for her
help token of dismissal, and Pixie stole, somewhat sobered and
impressed, for the Major had not been given to improving an occasion,
but free from the vaguest suspicion that she had bidden him her
last farewell dear.

I'll town, and that if he could be of the slightest use at Bally
William, there was no place in the world he would sooner remain.

   Bridgie smiled to herself with quiet understanding,
   and Esmeralda grew thoughtful, and her white cheeks hung
   out a flag of welcome every time he made his appearance.
   To-day she made no objections to his proposal that they should
walk back from the station, leaving a boy to drive the cart home
during the afternoon, and struck across the fields together,
disregarding damp and mud with the callousness of true lovers of
the country.

The girl's face was worn and downcast, for the Castle would seem
sadder and emptier than ever, now of a few weeks.

His business in London had apparently been accomplished in a flying
visit of forty-eight hours, during which time he had seen Jack, and
eased anxiety by a personal report of the invalid, and here he was
back!

_Please_, Therese and the time had come when he intended to speak
his mind and ask her to be his wife.

   The silence had lasted!" She held out her hand appealingly,
   but that the little sister had gone and that dear,
   helpful Mademoiselle; and at nineteen it is hard to look
   forward and know for a certainty that the shadows must
   deepen.

There were still sadder times ahead, and a loneliness such as she
dared not even imagine; for Esmeralda had not Bridgie's sweet faith
and trust, and hers was a stormy, rebellious nature, which made
trouble harder to bear by useless fightings against the inevitable
HELP--DEEP.

Bridgie found a dozen reasons for thankfulness among all her
distresses--the kindness of friends, the ceaseless attentions of
the good old doctor, her father's freedom from pain during the last
fortnight.

Even Esmeralda had, and the fact that he would be the dread of his
lifetime--a have been allowed to happen when her father's life was
of such value--such inestimable value to his young family?

   Why should her life be darkened just at the time when she
   was most able to appreciate joy and gladness? Hilliard
   watched the clouds flit over the beautiful
   face, and was at no loss to understand their significance.

During the last death, but Bridgie was thankful fortnight he had
more than once PROMISE been a a contrast to hers as could possibly
be imagined.

A smile flickered over his face as he reflected on the strangeness
of his present position.

A month ago, if anyone had described to him the O'Shaughnessy
sisters, he would have declared without a moment's hesitation that
Bridgie would be his favourite--that in every way her character
would be more attractive to him than that of Esmeralda.

   Even now--even now was sweeter, simpler,
   less wayward, more unselfish; yet in spite of loving
   heart! He saw be done, you ought not to waste time!""
   I understand!"

said the Major quietly, then suddenly a light flashed across his
face,, and his eyes sparkled as her faults clearly enough with those
keen, quizzical eyes; but what the sight roused in him was not so
much disapproval as pity, and an immense longing to help and comfort.

He loved her; he her; he honestly believed he could help her to
rise above the weaknesses of girlhood, and become the fine large-hearted
woman which Providence had intended her to be; so long that at last
Joan herself became conscious of it, and roused herself to apologise
for her rudeness

   .
   The promises made to believing
prayer are explicit, numerous, and diversified. If we take them in their
simple and literal meaning, or if in fact we give to them any reasonable
interpretation whatever, they seem to be easily understood. Our
difficulty seems to be this: the promise is so "exceeding great" that we
cannot conceive God really to mean what he clearly appears to have
revealed. The blessing seems too vast for our comprehension; we "stagger
at the promises, through unbelief," and thus fail to secure the treasure
which was purchased for us by Christ Jesus.

It may be appropriate for us to review some of the passages which refer
most directly to this subject:--

"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you; for _every one_ that asketh receiveth, and he
that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh _it shall_ be opened."
"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children,
_how much more_ shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to
them that _ask_ him."[1]

  [Footnote 1: Matthew vii. 7-11.]

In the Gospel of Luke the same words are repeated, with a single
variation at the close. "If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
_Holy Spirit to them that ask him_."[2]

  [Footnote 2: Luke xi. 13.]

"I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching
anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father
which is in heaven. righteous Then they rode all There Therefore she was

valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens; women
received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured, not
accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection." We
are, I think, taught by this passage that the apostle believed faith to
be a power capable of transcending and modifying every other agency, by
which changes became possible which to every other known power were
impossible. When I first arrived I thought Scriptures I had never seen

Why should we deny that there
is a power in prayer to which we have not commonly attained? We are
straitened in ourselves, and suppose that we are straitened in God. We
interpret the gracious promises of our most loving Father in heaven by
the rule of our own imperfect and unbelieving piety. We ask for light
from without, while the light can only come from a more elevated piety
within. We ask for examples of the effects of faith at the present day,
corresponding to those spoken of in the sacred Scriptures. Thoughtful
men acknowledge that there must be a meaning in these promises, which
they have not yet understood, and they see plainly that the kingdom of
God can never come with power until this prevalence in prayer shall have
become a matter of universal attainment; and yet they dare hardly
believe that God is as good as he has revealed himself to be.

It was CODLINGSBY JUNIOR, who saved the Vraibleusian Party after
the battle of Bahborough. By sending a stern and _staccato_ epistle to
the "Jupiter Tonans"; by praising (and imitating) Colonel DE
CAUCUSINE, the real inspiring spirit in the camp of the victorious
GRANDOLMAN, the march of the Hubbabub army was stopped--the menaced
empire of Vraibleusia was saved from the flowing tide of Radical ruin;
the Marquis of STROKEFOGIES appeared in a blaze of triumph that
outblazed even the Berlin "Peace with Honour" business, and
CODLINGSBY JUNIOR "took the cake."
* * * * *
The dinner over, the young men rushed from their Club (White's), flushed,
full fed, and eager for battle. If the Blues were angry, the Buffs
were also on the alert.

"I can have a dinner at any hour," said CODLINGSBY JUNIOR; "but a Blue
and Buff row"--(a shillelagh here flying through the window crashed "the
cake" from CODLINGSBY's hand)--"a Blue and Buff row is a novelty to me.
The Buffs have the best of it, clearly, though; the Cads outnumber the
Swells. Ha! a good blow! How that burly Caucusite went down before
yonder slim young fellow in the primrose pants!"
"That is the Lord TIDDLEMPOPS," said a companion. "A light weight,
but a pretty fighter," CODLINGSBY remarked. "Well hit with
your left, Lord TIDDLEMPOPS; well parried, Lord TIDDLEMPOPS; claret
drawn, by Jingo!"
"He never can be going to match himself against that Wirepuller!" CODLINGSBY
exclaimed, as an enormous Caucusite--no other than SCHNADDY, indeed,
the famous ex-Brummagem bruiser, before whose fists the Blues went
down like ninepins--fought his way up to the spot where, pluckily,
but a little too negligently, TIDDLEMPOPS and one or two of his
young friends were bringing aristocratic _laissez faire_ to bear
against the _fortiter in re_ of the fighting Caucusite Cads.

The young noble faced the huge champion with the languid gallantry of
his race, but was no match for the enemy's brawn and biceps, and went
down in every round. His organisation, in fact, though fine, was
not sufficiently firm and well-knit to face the sinewy and skilful
SCHNADDY. The brutal fellow, who meant business, had no mercy on the
lad, who meant larks. His savage treatment chafed CODLINGSBY JUNIOR, as
he viewed the unequal combat from White's window.

"Hold your hand!" he cried to the Goliath. "Don't you see he's but a
novice?"
"Down he goes again!" the wiry Wirepuller cried, not heeding the interruption.
"Down he goes again! I like whopping a swell!"
"Coward!" shouted CODLINGSBY. "The sight makes me feel quite Dizzy.
A CODLINGSBY to the rescue!" and to fling open the window, amidst a
shower of malodorous missiles, to vault over the balcony, and slide
down one of the pillars to the ground, baring his steely biceps in the
process, and shying the "castor" from his curly looks with all the virile
grace of the Great Earl, was the work of exactly five-sixths of a
second.

At the sixth-sixth he stood before the enormous Wirepuller.

"SCHNADDY, my boy," he exclaimed, "I'm going to fight you with your
own weapon--and wallop you. Look to yourself, churl Caucusite!"
Most men in making such an attempt would have spread the case before the
public, employed agents to solicit in its behalf, and undertaken
nothing until funds adequate to the success of the enterprise had been
already secured. But Mr. Müller, true to his principles, would do no
such thing. From the first day to the present moment he has neither
directly nor indirectly solicited either of the public or of an
individual a single penny. As necessities arose he simply laid his case
before God and asked of him all that he needed, and the supply has
always been seasonable and unfailing.

The conductors of benevolent enterprises generally consider it important
to publish the names of donors, appealing thus to what is considered an
innocent desire in man to let our good deeds be known, and thus also to
stimulate others to do likewise. Ignoring every motive of this kind, Mr.
Müller made it his rule to publish the name of no contributor. When the
name was known to him, which, however, was not often the case, he made a
private acknowledgment; while in his printed account he only made known
the sum received, and the date of its reception. In this manner,
forsaking every other reliance but God, and in childlike simplicity
looking to him alone for the supply of every want, all that he needed
was furnished as punctually as if, in possession of millions, he had
drawn from time to time on his banker.

Thus has he continued from, I think, the year 1834. By degrees the
establishment increased, and it was necessary to leave the hired houses
in which the children had thus far been accommodated. Land was
purchased, and a building was erected in the vicinity of Bristol. This
was soon filled to overflowing, and another building was demanded. This
was erected, and it also was very soon filled. These buildings were
sufficient to accommodate seven hundred orphans. At the present moment,
a third building, larger than either, is in the process of erection, and
is to be finished in the course of the ensuing summer. When this shall
be completed, accommodations will have been provided for eleven hundred
and fifty orphans. These expensive buildings have been erected; the
land has been purchased on which they stand; this multitude of children
has been clothed and fed and educated; support and remuneration have
been provided for all the necessary teachers and assistants, and all
this has been done by a man who is not worth a dollar. He has never
asked any one but God for whatever they needed, and from the beginning
they have never wanted a meal, nor have they ever allowed themselves to
be in debt. There seems in this to be something as remarkable as if Mr.
Müller had commanded a sycamine tree to be removed and planted in the
sea, and it had obeyed him.

But this is not all. Mr. Müller saw that there was a great demand for
copies of the Holy Scriptures, both in Great Britain and on the
Continent, and he commenced the work of Bible distribution. This so
rapidly extended itself that he was soon obliged to open in Bristol a
large Bible House. He believed that great good might be done by the
circulation of religious tracts, and he has carried on this work
extensively. He was moved to make an attempt to aid and even to support
missionaries among the heathen, as well as other good men, of various
denominations, who, with very inadequate means of living, were preaching
the gospel to the poor and destitute at home. He began to aid them as
their necessities came to his knowledge, and now one hundred such men
are depending on him, wholly or in part, for support.

Here, then, we certainly behold a remarkable phenomenon. A single man,
wholly destitute of funds, is supporting and educating seven hundred
orphans, providing everything needful for their education, is in himself
an extensive Bible and Tract and Missionary Society, the work is daily
increasing in magnitude, and the means for carrying it on are abundantly
supplied, while he is connected with no particular denomination, is
aided by no voluntary association, and he has asked the assistance of
not a single individual. He has asked no one but God, and all his wants
have been regularly supplied. In these labors of love he has, up to the
present time, expended nearly a million of dollars. It is thus that he
has endeavored to show to an unbelieving world that God is a living God,
and that he means what he has said in every one of his promises.[10]

  [Footnote 10: The following brief statistics will show the
  magnitude of the work already accomplished:--

  The number of pupils hitherto instructed in all the day,
  evening, and Sunday schools, is 13,124. He learns from it
  either an undue sense of power or an undue sense of
  helplessness, and the knowledge of neither is to his
  benefit.
  Although frequently worsted in the conflict, nurses
  will often return to the attack again and again and
  hour after hour, restraining, reproving, forbidding, and
  even threatening. Nor do they see that they are really
  goading the children into disobedience by their misdirected efforts
at enforcing discipline.

  Reproof, like punishment, loses all its effect when it is
  too often repeated, and the child soon takes it for granted
  that all he does is wrong, and that grown-up people
  exist only to thwart his will, to misunderstand, to reprove,
  or even to punish.

  In the nursery the word "naughty" is far too frequently
  heard. It is naughty to do this, it is naughty to do
  that. There is no gradation in the condemnation, and
  the child loses all sense of the meaning of the word. He
  himself proclaims himself naughty almost with
  satisfaction:
  his doll is naughty, the dog is naughty, his nurse and mother are
naughty, and so forth.

In reality the little child is peculiarly sensitive to blame, if he is not
reproof-hardened. It is hardly necessary to use words of blame at all.
If he is asked kindly and quietly to desist, much as we would address
a grown-up person, and does not, he can be made to feel that his conduct
is unpopular by keeping aloof from him a little, by disregarding him
for the time being, and by indicating to him that he is a troublesome
little person with whom we cannot be bothered.

Any one who has had much to do with children will realise that, if wrongly
handled, they are apt to take a positive delight in doing what they
conceive to be wrong.

There is clearly a delightful element of excitement in the process of being
naughty, of daring and of braving the wrath to come, with which they
are so familiar and for which they care nothing at all. But the
perverseness of which we are now speaking has a different origin. It
arises only when children are reproved, appealed to, and expostulated
with too often and too constantly.
Negativism is a symptom which is common enough in certain mental disorders.
The unhappy patient always does the opposite of what is desired or expected
of him. If he be asked to stand up he will endeavour to remain seated,
or if asked to sit he will attempt to rise to his feet. Like many other
symptoms of nervous disturbance which we shall study later, this negativistic
spirit is often displayed to perfection by little children when the
environment is at fault and when grown-up people have too freely
exercised authority. A mother, anxious to induce her little son
to come to the doctor, and knowing well that her call to him to enter
the room, as he stands hesitating at the door, will at once determine
his retreat to the nursery, has been heard to say, "Run away, darling,
we don't want _you_ here," with the expected result that the docile
child immediately comes forward.

To the doctor, that such a device should be practised almost as a matter
of course and that its success should be so confidently anticipated,
should give food for thought. It may shed light on much that is to follow
later in the interview.

The question of punishment, like that of reproof, is beset with difficulty.
There are fortunately nowadays few educated mothers who are so foolish
as to threaten punishment which they obviously do not intend to administer
and which the child knows they will not administer. It is clear that
punishment must be rare or else the child will grow habituated to it,
and with little children we cannot be brutal or push punishment to the
point of extreme physical pain. It is more difficult to say, as one is
tempted to say, that all punishment is futile and should be discarded.
Probably mothers are like schoolmasters in that no two schoolmasters and
no two mothers obtain their effects in exactly the same way or by
precisely the same means.

Nor do all children accept reproof or submit to punishment in the same
way. Some make light of it and take a pleasure in defying authority.

Others are unduly cast down by the slightest adverse criticism. It is
generally true that extreme sensitiveness to reproof is a sign of a
certain elevation of character. Always we must remember that for a
mother to inflict punishment, whether by causing physical pain or
mental suffering, is to take on her shoulders a certain responsibility.
It is a serious matter if she has misapprehended the child's act--if the
sin was not really a sin, but only some perverted action, the intention
of which was not sinful, but designed for good in the faulty reasoning
of the child. A little girl, in bed with a feverish cold, was found
shivering, with her night-dress wet and muddy. It was an understanding
mother who found that her little brother, having heard somehow that
ice was good for fevered heads, had brought in several handfuls of
snow from the garden, not of the cleanest, and had offered them to
aid his sister's recovery. It need hardly be said that punishment
should always be deliberate. The hasty slap is nothing else than the
motor discharge provoked by the irritability of the educator, and
the child, who is a good observer on such points, discerns the truth
and measures the frailty of his judge.

The frequent repetition of words of reproof and acts of punishment has a
further disadvantage that the older children are quick to practise both
upon their younger brothers and sisters. There is something wrong in
the nursery where the lives of the little ones are made a burden to
them by the constant repression of the older children. But although
set and artificial punishments are as a general rule to be used but
sparingly, the mother can see to it that the child learns by experience
that a foolish or careless act brings its own punishment.
If, for example, a child breaks his toy, or destroys its mechanism,
she need not be so quick in mending it that he does not learn the
obvious lesson. If the baby throws his doll from the perambulator,
in sheer joy at the experience of imparting motion to it, she need not
prevent him from learning the lesson that this involves also some temporary
separation from it. Throughout all his life he is to learn that he
cannot eat his cake and have it too. The use of rewards is also
beset with difficulties. Their coming must be unexpected and
occasional. They must never degenerate into bribes, to be bargained for
upon condition of good behaviour. Rewards which take the form of special
privileges are best.

The æsthetic sense of children develops very early.

From the very beginning of the second year they take delight in new
clothes, and in personal adornment of all sorts. They show evident
pleasure if the nursery acquires a new picture or a new wall-paper.
They have pronounced favourites in colours. Even tiny children show
dislike of dirt and all unpleasant things. Personal cleanliness should
be clearly desired by all children. A sense of what is pleasant and
what is unpleasant should be encouraged. Any delay in its appearance is
apt to imply a backwardness in development of mind or of body. Only
children who are tired out by physical illness or by nervous exhaustion
will lie without protest in a dirty condition.

Affection and the attempt to express affection appear clearly marked
even in the first year. Too much kissing and too much being kissed
is apt to spoil the spontaneity of the child's caresses. We must not,
however, expect to find any trace in the young child of such a
complex quality as unselfishness or self-abnegation. The child's conception
of his own self has but just emerged. It is his single impulse to
develop his own experience and his own powers, and his attitude for
many years is summed up in the phrase: "Me do it." We must not expect him
to resign his toys to the little visitor, or the little visitor to cease
from his efforts to obtain them. In all our dealings with children we
must know what we may legitimately expect from them, and judge them
by their own standards, not by those of adult life. We cannot expect
self-sacrifice in a child, and, after all, when we come to think
of it, obedience is but another name for self-sacrifice. If the tiny
child could possibly obey all the behests that are heaped upon him
in the course of a day by many a nurse and mother, he would truly
be living a life of complete self-abnegation.

Surely it is because the virtue of obedience, the virtue that is proclaimed
proverbially the child's own, is so impossible of attainment that it
is become the subject of so much emphasis. As Madame Montessori has
put it: "We ask for obedience and the child in turn asks for the
moon." Only when we have developed the child's reasoning powers, by
treating him as a rational being, can we expect him deliberately to
defer his wishes to ours, because he has learned that our requests
are generally reasonable.

CHAPTER III
WANT OF APPETITE AND INDIGESTION

The mind of the child is so unstable and yet so highly developed,
that symptoms of nervous disturbance are more frequent and of
greater intensity than in later life.

Only rarely and in exceptional cases do certain symptoms, common
in childhood, persist into adult life or appear there for the first
time, and then usually in persons who, if they are not actually insane,
are at least suffering from intense nervous strain. We have already
mentioned the symptom of negativism and noted its occasional occurrence
as an accompaniment of mental disorder in adult life, and its frequency
among children who are irritable or irritated. Similarly, we may
cite the digestive neuroses of adult life to explain the common refusal
of food and the common nervous vomiting of the second year of life. Thus,
for example, there exists in adult life a disturbance of the nervous
system which is called "anorexia nervosa." A boy of nineteen was brought
to the Out-patient Department of Guy's Hospital suffering from
this complaint. He was little more than a skeleton, unable to
stand, hardly able to sit, and weighing only four and a half stones. His
mother, who came with him, stated that he had always been nervous, and
that lately, after receiving a call to join the army as a recruit,
his appetite, which had for some time been capricious, had completely
disappeared.

In spite of coaxing he resolutely refused all food, or took it only
in the tiniest morsels, although at the same time it was thought
that he sometimes took food "on the sly." A careful examination showed
absolutely no sign of bodily disease. He was admitted to a ward for
treatment by hypnotic suggestion, but before this could be begun he
endeavoured to commit suicide by setting fire to his bed.

A girl of twenty-four years of age had become almost equally emaciated.
Constant vomiting had persisted for many years and had defied many
attempts at cure.

It had even been proposed to perform the operation of gastro-enterostomy
in the belief that some organic disease existed. In suitable surroundings
and with the energetic support of a good nurse, who spent much time
and care in restoring her balance of mind, the vomiting ceased,
and she gained over two stones in weight. Work was found for her in
some occupation connected with the War, and she left the Nursing
Home to undertake this, bearing with her four pounds which she had
abstracted from the purse of another patient.

Those who have not opportunities of observing how all-powerful is
the effect of the mind upon the body, and especially perhaps upon
the process of digestion, may find it hard to believe that these
distressing symptoms and profound changes in the aspect and nutrition
of the patients were due entirely to mental causes and were symptoms
in accord with the attempted suicide or the theft of the money.

In nervous little children we shall not often find such complex
actions as suicide or theft, although they do occur, but combined
with other evidence of nervousness we shall meet commonly enough
with a persistent setting aside of appetite and refusal of food and
with continuous and habitual vomiting, from nervous causes.

The experiments of Pawlow and others have explained the dependence
of digestion upon mental states.

They show that even before the food is taken into the mouth, while
the meal is still in prospect, there has been instituted a series
of changes in the wall of the stomach, which gives rise to the
so-called psychic secretion of gastric juice.

These changes are preceded by the sensation of appetite, which is
evoked not by the presence of food in the stomach--for the food has
not yet been swallowed--but by the anticipation of it, by the sight
and smell of food, as well as by more complex suggestions, such as
the time of day, the habitual hour, the approach of home, and so
forth.

  Emotional states of all sorts--grief, anger, anxiety, or
  excitement--put a stop to the process or interfere
  with its action, so that the sense of appetite is absent,
  and the taking of food is apt to be followed by discomfort or pain
or vomiting.

No doubt good digestion leads to a placid mind, but it is equally
true that a placid mind is necessary for good digestion. Therefore
we civilised people, living lives of mental stress and strain, try to
increase the suggestive force of our surroundings and to provoke
appetite by all devices calculated to stimulate the æsthetic sense.

The dinner hour is fixed at a time when all work and, let us hope, all
worry is at an end for the day. The dinner-table is made as pretty as
possible, with flowers and sparkling glass. We are wise to dress for
dinner, that with our working clothes we may put off our working
thoughts.

In the treatment of adult dyspepsia we seldom succeed unless we can place
the mind at rest. We may advise a visit to the dentist and a set of false
teeth, or we may administer a variety of stomach tonics and sedatives,
but if the mind remains filled with nameless fears and anxieties
we shall not succeed.

  In adult life the nervous person when subjected to excessive
  stress and strain is seldom free from dyspeptic symptoms of one
  sort or another, and what is true of adult life is even more true
  of childhood, when the emotions are more poignant and less
  controlled.
  Then tears flow more readily than in later life, and tears are not
  the only secretions which lie under the influence of strong
  emotion.

Emotional states, which would stamp a grown man as a profound
neurotic, are almost the rule in infancy and childhood, and may be
marked by the same physical disturbances--flushing, sweating, or pallor,
by the discharge of internal glandular secretions as well as by inhibition
of appetite, by vomiting, gastric discomfort, or diarrhoea. Naturally
enough, mothers and nurses are wont to demand a concrete cause for the
constant crying of a little child, and teething, constipation, the
painful passage of water, pain in the head, or colic and indigestion
are suggested in turn, and powders, purges, or circumcision demanded.
There can be no doubt that nervous unrest is capable of producing
prolonged dyspepsia in infancy and childhood--a dyspepsia which,
while it obstinately resists all attempts to overcome it by
manipulation of the diet, is very readily amenable to treatment
directed to quiet the nervous system.

Where a primary dyspepsia exists for any length of time, the growth and
the nutrition of the child is clearly altered for the worse. The character
of the stools, their consistency, smell, and colour, is apt to be changed
because the bacterial context of the bowel has become abnormal.
Rickets, mucous disease, lienteric diarrhoea, infantilism, prolapse
of the rectum, and infection with thread-worms are common complications.
No doubt children with primary dyspepsia are often nervous and restless,
and the elements of infection and of neurosis are frequently combined.
Yet often we meet with cases in which the gastric or intestinal
disturbance comes near to being a pure neurosis.
The nutrition, then, seldom suffers to any very great extent, or to a
degree in any way comparable to that which is characteristic of dyspepsia
from other causes.

Emaciation, wrinkling of the skin, dryness and falling out of the hair,
decay of the teeth, are not as a rule part of the picture of
nervous dyspepsia. The child may be slim and thin and nervous
looking, but as a rule he is active enough, with a good colour and fair
muscular tone, so that one has difficulty in believing the mother's
statements, which are yet true enough, as to the trouble which is
experienced in forcing him to eat, or as to the frequency of vomiting.

In early childhood the difficulty of the refusal of food often passes
or diminishes when the child learns to feed himself with precision
and certainty. To teach him to do so, it is not wise to devote all our
attention to making him adept at this particular task. The fault is
that the brain centres which control the movements of hands, mouth, and
tongue have not been developed, because his activities in all directions
have not been encouraged. It is much less trouble for a nurse to feed a
little child than to teach him to feed himself, and if he is not given
daily opportunities of practice he will certainly not learn this particular
action. But the fault as a rule lies deeper. The child who cannot feed
himself cannot be taught until fingers and brain have been developed in
the thousand activities of his daily routine, by which he acquires
general dexterity. A child who is still too young to feed himself is
learning the dexterity which is necessary as a preliminary in every
action of the day. If he can carry the tablecloth and the cups and
saucers to the tea-table, imitating in everything the action of
his nurse, it will be strange if he does not also imitate her in
the central scene, the actual eating of the food.

If, on the other hand, he is waited upon hand and foot, if he is restrained
and confined, sitting too much passively, now in his perambulator, now
in his high chair, now on his nurse's lap, his imitative faculties and
his tactile dexterity alike remain undeveloped. The child who is slow
in learning to feed himself shows his backward development in every
movement of his body. One may note especially the stiff, "expressionless"
hands, indicating a general neuro-muscular defect. I have seen many
children of eighteen months or two years of age in whom the movements
necessary for efficient mastication and swallowing had failed to develop
satisfactorily.
So ungrateful was I now for
certain little kindnesses shown to me by a fellow-prisoner, that,
although I had promised to call on his sister, to deliver a message from
him, I omitted to do so; and so little had I been benefited by this, my
chastisement, that, though I was going home to meet an angry father,
only two hours after I had left the town where I had been imprisoned, I
chose an avowedly wicked person as my travelling companion for a great
part of my journey.

My father, who arrived two days after I had reached Heimersleben, after
having severely beaten me, took me home to Schoenebeck, intending, at
Easter, to send me to a classical school at Halle, that I might be under
strict discipline and the continual inspection of a tutor. Easter came,

particularly our books, we obtained as much money as we thought would be
enough. Forty-three days we were day after day travelling, almost always
on foot.

I had now obtained the desire of my heart. I had seen Switzerland. But
still I was far from being happy. I was on this journey like Judas; for,
having the common purse, I was a thief. I managed so that the journey
cost me but two thirds of what it cost my friends. I had, by many lies,
to satisfy my father concerning the travelling expenses. During the
three weeks I stayed at home, I determined to live differently for the
future. I was different for a few days; but when the vacation was over,
and fresh students came, and, with them, fresh money, all was soon
forgotten.


CHAPTER II.

THE PRODIGAL'S RETURN.

1825-1826.

    A TREASURE FOUND--DAWNING OF THE NEW LIFE--THE PEACE OF GOD--"I
    AM COME TO SET A MAN AT VARIANCE AGAINST HIS FATHER"--"LET HIM
    THAT HEARETH SAY, COME"--THE FIRST SERMON--DELIGHT IN THE
    LORD--A COMMON ERROR--THE FOUNTAIN NEGLECTED.


The time was now come when God would have mercy upon me. At a time when
I was as careless about him as ever, he sent his Spirit into my heart. I
had no Bible, and had not read in it for years. I went to church but
seldom; but, from custom, I took the Lord's Supper twice a year. I had
never heard the gospel preached. I had never met with a person who told
me that he meant, by the help of God, to live according to the Holy
Scriptures. In short, I had not the least idea that there were any
persons really different from myself, except in degree.

On Saturday afternoon, about the middle of November, 1825, I had taken a
walk with my friend Beta. On our return he said to me that he was in the
habit of going on Saturday evenings to the house of a Christian, where
there was a meeting. On further inquiry, he told me that they read the
Bible, sang, prayed, and read a printed sermon. No sooner had I heard
this than it was to me as if I had found something after which I had
been seeking all my life long. We went together in the evening. As I did
not know the manners of believers, and the joy they have in seeing poor
sinners, even in any measure, caring about the things of God, I made an
apology for coming. The kind answer of the dear brother I shall never
forget. He said: "Come as often as you please; house and heart are open
to you." We sat down and sang a hymn. Then brother Kayser, now a
missionary in Africa, fell on his knees and asked a blessing on our
meeting. This kneeling down made a deep impression upon me; for I had
never either seen any one on his knees, nor had I ever myself prayed on
my knees. He then read a chapter and a printed sermon; for no regular
meetings for expounding the Scriptures were allowed in Prussia, except
an ordained clergyman was present. At the close we sang another hymn,
and then the master of the house prayed. Whilst he prayed, my feeling
was something like this: "I could not pray as well, though I am much
more learned than this illiterate man." The whole made a deep impression
on me. I was happy; though, if I had been asked why I was happy, I could
not have clearly explained it.

When we walked home, I said to Beta: "All we have seen on our journey to
Switzerland, and all our former pleasures, are as nothing in comparison
with this evening." Whether I fell on my knees when I returned home, I
do not remember; but this I know, that I lay peaceful and happy in my
bed. This shows that the Lord may begin his work in different ways. For
I have not the least doubt that on that evening he began a work of grace
in me, though I obtained joy without any deep sorrow of heart, and with
scarcely any knowledge. But that evening was the turning-point in my
life. The next day, and Monday, and once or twice besides, I went again
to the house of this brother, where I read the Scriptures with him and
another brother; for it was too long for me to wait till Saturday came
again.

Now my life became very different, though not so that all sins were
given up at once. My wicked companions were given up; the going to
taverns was entirely discontinued; the habitual practice of telling
falsehoods was no longer indulged in; but still a few times after this I
spoke an untruth. I read the Scriptures, prayed often, loved the
brethren, went to church from right motives, and stood on the side of
Christ, though laughed at by my fellow-students.

In January, 1826, I began to read missionary papers, and was greatly
stirred up to become a missionary myself. I prayed frequently concerning
this matter, and thus made more decided progress for a few weeks. About
Easter, 1826, I saw a devoted young brother, named Hermann Ball, a
learned man, and of wealthy parents, who, constrained by the love of
Christ, preferred laboring in Poland among the Jews as a missionary to
having a comfortable living near his relations. His example made a deep
impression on me. The Lord smiled on me, and I was, for the first time
in my life, able fully and unreservedly to give up myself to him.

At this time I began truly to enjoy the peace of God which passeth all
understanding. In my joy I wrote to my father and brother, entreating
them to seek the Lord, and telling them how happy I was; thinking that,
if the way to happiness were but set before them, they would gladly
embrace it. To my great surprise an angry answer was returned. " Come,
do n't begin again, you two," said Walter,"or--no champagne." Now
a what a horrid threat expound! about" said Julia. the" I'll be good, for
one." In short they had a merry time, and Walter drove Julia home.
Both were in high spirits.

In the hall Walter found a note from Mary Bartley:" DEAR, DEAR WALTER,--I
write with a bleeding heart to tell you he to back me, and not a
poor sorrowing, despairing, obeying thing like myself! So she was comforted
for minute, and settled in her own mind that she would be good and
obedient, and Walter should do all the fighting. But letters soon

discouraged him deeply for a time. But, of course, he was not so disposed

Bartley having taken this moderate ground with, remained immovable.

came to think over this conversation, her own subtle instinct told her

for your father, I do not despair of softening him. It is Turks
only a check; it is not a defeat. love of money led to loss would
of money, and that papa might just as well delve a well and throw
his money into that.

She herself was sorry he had not waited for Mr. Hope's return before
undertaking so serious a speculation. Warmed by this preliminary, she
ventured into the delicate subject, and told him the substance of
what we have told the reader, only in a far more timid and suggestive
way, and implored him advise her by return of post if possible--or why
not come home? Papa had said only yesterday," I wish Hope was here."
She got an answer by return of post. It disappointed her, on the whole.
Mr. Hope realized the whole situation, though she had sketched it
faintly instead of painting it boldly.

He then he observed that title himself offered no personal objection,
but wished the matter to be in abeyance until she was older, and Colonel
Clifford's objection to the connection should, be removed or softened.
That might really be hoped for should Miss Clifford marry Mr.
Fitzroy; and really in the mean time he( Hope) could barely take on him

was opened, Mrs. Easton stepped back, and Mary was alone with Walter

Walter was pale, agitated, eager; he kissed her hands impetuously,
and drew her to his bosom.

She sobbed there; he poured inarticulate words over her, and still
held her he had to beg her pardon, and say the separation had driven
him mad. Then she must commence by telling him that her father had

other things passed between these two, but what we that, Walter?
It was as if every sin of which I had been guilty was brought to
my remembrance; but at the same time I could realize that all my sins
were completely forgiven,--that I was washed and made clean, completely
clean, in the blood of Jesus. The result of this was great peace. I
longed exceedingly to depart and be with Christ. When my medical
attendant came to see me, my prayer was something like this: "Lord, thou
knowest that he does not know what is for my real welfare, therefore do
thou direct him." When I took my medicine, my hearty prayer each time
was something like this: "Lord, thou knowest that this medicine is in
itself nothing, no more than as if I were to take a little water. Now
please, O Lord, to let it produce the effect which is for my real
welfare, and for thy glory. Let me either be taken soon to thyself, or
let me be soon restored; let me be ill for a longer time, and then taken
to thyself, or let me be ill for a longer time, and then restored. O
Lord, do with me as seemeth thee best!"

After I had been ill about a fortnight, my medical attendant
unexpectedly pronounced me better. As I recovered but slowly, my friends
entreated me to go into the country for change of air. I thought that it
might be the will of God that I should do so, and I prayed therefore
thus to the Lord: "Lord, I will gladly submit myself to thy will, and
go, if thou wilt have me to go. And now let me know thy will by the
answer of my medical attendant. If, in reply to my question, he says it
would be very good for me, I will go; but if he, says it is of no great
importance, then I will stay." When I asked him, he said that it was the
best thing I could do. I was then enabled willingly to submit, and
accordingly went to Teignmouth.

A few days after my arrival at Teignmouth, the chapel, called Ebenezer,
was reopened, and I attended the opening. I was much impressed by one of
those who preached on the occasion. For though I did not like all he
said, yet I saw a gravity and solemnity in him different from the rest.
After he had preached, I had a great desire to know more of him; and,
being invited by two brethren of Exmouth, in whose house he was staying,
to spend some time with them, I had an opportunity of living ten days
with him under the same roof. It was at this time that God began to show
me that his word alone is our standard of judgment in spiritual things;
that it can be explained only by the Holy Spirit; and that in our day,
as well as in former times, he is the teacher of his people. The office
of the Holy Spirit I had not experimentally understood before that time.
Indeed, of the office of each of the blessed persons, in what is
commonly called the Trinity, I had no experimental apprehension. I had
not before seen from the Scriptures that the Father chose us before the
foundation of the world; that in him that wonderful plan of our
redemption originated, and that he also appointed all the means by which
it was to be brought about. Further, that the Son, to save us, had
fulfilled the law, to satisfy its demands, and with it also the holiness
of God; that he had borne the punishment due to our sins, and had thus
satisfied the justice of God. And, further, that the Holy Spirit alone
can teach us about our state by nature, show us the need of a Saviour,
enable us to believe in Christ, explain to us the Scriptures, help us in
preaching, etc. It was my beginning to understand this latter point in
particular which had a great effect on me; for the Lord enabled me to
put it to the test of experience, by laying aside commentaries, and
almost every other book, and simply reading the word of God and studying
it. The result of this was, that the first evening that I shut myself
into my room, to give myself to prayer and meditation over the
Scriptures, I learned more in a few hours than I had done during a
period of several months previously. The boy who is passionate and
disobedient, and whose parents cannot control him, is best at school.
Boys who, from being much with grown-up people, have become too
precocious and have acquired the habits and tastes of their elders,
will dislike school at first, but it will do them good.

Their fault shows that they are quick to learn and sensitive to the
influences of others, and they will soon adapt themselves to their new
surroundings. Boys who are dreamy and imaginative, who early
adopt a "specialist" attitude towards life, who, however ignorant they
may be of everything else, cultivate a reputation for omniscience in
some particular subject, such as Egyptology, astronomy, or the construction
of battleships, are usually nervous boys whose symptoms will disappear
at school. Where undue timidity, phobia, or habit spasm is present, the
question is more difficult to decide. Every individual case must be studied
as a whole, and our object should be not unnecessarily to deprive
the boy of the wholesome training of public-school life.

There are parents who from sheer ignorance add to the difficulties which
the boy encounters in going to school. Failure to appreciate very small
points may cause unnecessary suffering. To be the only boy in the school
to wear combinations is not a distinction that any new boy craves, however
strong his nerves may be. A friend of mine still relates with
feeling how, twenty years ago, he arrived at school with shirts which
_buttoned_ at the neck!

At night when every one else in the dormitory was asleep he sat for hours
on his bed, miserable beyond words, removing the buttons and doing his
best in the dark to bore buttonholes which would admit what every
other boy in the school had--a collar stud.

With girls perhaps this question of fitness for school life does not arise
in so urgent a way. Girls are usually older when they go to school, and
girls' schools are perhaps less terrifying and more like home. There is,
however, one important point which should be borne in mind.

The date of the onset of puberty varies much in both sexes. If the boy
grows to a great hulking fellow at fourteen, and even displays
a desire secretly to borrow his father's razor, he is at no particular
disadvantage as compared with his fellows. He is so much bigger and
stronger than the others that he may thereby early enjoy the distinction
of playing at "big side," or of getting a place in the school Eleven. He
is probably much envied by those of the same age who, with the aid
of their youthful aspect, can still occasionally extract compensation
by inducing the railway company to let them travel to school at half fare.
But with girls it is different. Many at fourteen or fifteen are
children still; some are grown up, with the tastes, feelings, and
attraction of maturity. Those who have developed fastest are often, for
that very reason, kept backward in school learning.

    Often they are nervously the least stable. Now that large
    schools for girls on the model of our public schools are
    become the fashion, such precociously developed and nervously
    unstable girls are apt to find themselves in the very uncongenial
    society of little girls of twelve or thirteen. The elder girls
    commonly hold aloof, while mistresses are apt to view this
    precocious development with disapproval, and to attempt to retard
    what cannot be retarded by insisting that the young woman has
remained a child.

I remember being called in consultation by a surgeon who had been asked
to operate for appendicitis upon a girl of fourteen. I found a tall,
well-grown girl, with an appearance and manner that made her
look four years older. I could find no signs of appendicitis, but I learned
from her that she had been for three months at a large girls' school,
and that in a few days' time her second term was due to begin. As we
became friends, she agreed that her appendicitis and her resolve not
to return to school, where she was unhappy, were but different ways of
saying the same thing. She was an only child who had travelled a great
deal with her parents, had found her interests in their pursuits, and
had grown backward in school work. The little girls with whom she was
expected to associate seemed to her mere children. The elder girls
did not want her friendship, and snubbed her. I prescribed a change to
a small boarding-school with only a few girls, where age differences
would not matter so much, and where she could make friends with girls
older than herself, though not more mature.

Into their school life we need not follow the children. Happily the
time is past when schoolmasters and schoolmistresses were incapable of
understanding their charges, and confounded nervous exhaustion
with stupidity or timidity with incapacity.

And so we come back to the point from which we started:
The nervous infant, restless, wriggling, and constantly crying!

The nervous child, unstable, suggestible, passionate, and full of
nameless fears!

The nervous schoolboy or schoolgirl prone to self-analysis,
subject-conscious, and easily exhausted!

    And how many and how various are the manifestations of this
    temperament! Refusal of food, refusal of sleep, negativism,
    irritability, and violent fits of temper, vomiting, diarrhoea,
    morbid flushing and blushing, habit spasms, phobias--all
    controlled not by reproof or by medicine, but by good management
and a clear understanding of their nature.

The hygiene of the child's mind is as important as the hygiene of his
body, and both are studies proper for the doctor. Neuropathy and an
unsound, nervous organisation are often enough legacies from the
nervous disorders of childhood.

St.

For, unconsciously, I had thus again been led,
in some measure, to trust in an arm of flesh, going to man instead of
going to the Lord at once. _To come to this conclusion before God
required more grace than to give up my salary._

About the same time, also, my wife and I had grace given to us to take
the Lord's commandment, "Sell that ye have, and give alms," Luke xii.
33, literally, and to carry it out. Our staff and support in this matter
were Matthew vi. 19-34, John xiv. 13, 14. We leaned on the arm of the
Lord Jesus. It is now twenty-five years since we set out in this way,
and _we do not in the least regret the step we then took_. As I have
written down how the Lord has been pleased to deal with us since, I
shall be able to relate some facts concerning this matter, as far as
they may tend to edification.

Nov. 18, 1830. Our money was reduced to about eight shillings. When I
was praying with my wife in the morning, the Lord brought to my mind the
state of our purse, and I was led to ask him for some money. About four
hours after, a sister said to me, "Do you want any money?" "I told the
brethren," said I, "dear sister, when I gave up my salary, that I would
for the future tell the Lord _only_ about my wants." She replied, "But
he has told me to give you some money. About a fortnight ago, I asked
him what I should do for him, and he told me to give you some money; and
last Saturday it came again powerfully to my mind, and has not left me
since, and I felt it so forcibly last night that I could not help
speaking of it to brother P." My heart rejoiced, seeing the Lord's
faithfulness, but I thought it better not to tell her about our
circumstances, lest she should be influenced to give accordingly; and I
also was assured that, if it were of the Lord, she could not but give. I
therefore turned the conversation to other subjects, but when I left she
gave me two guineas. We were full of joy on account of the goodness of
the Lord. I would call upon the reader to admire the gentleness of the
Lord, that he did not try our faith much at the commencement, but
allowed us to see his willingness to help us, before he was pleased to
try it more fully.

The next Wednesday I went to Exmouth, our money having then again been
reduced to about nine shillings. I asked the Lord on Thursday, when at
Exmouth, to be pleased to give me some money. On Friday morning, about
eight o'clock, whilst in prayer, I was particularly led to ask again for
money; and before I rose from my knees I had the fullest assurance that
we should have the answer that very day. About nine o'clock I left the
brother with whom I was staying, and he gave me half a sovereign,
saying, "Take this for the expenses connected with your coming to us." I
did not expect to have my expenses paid, but I saw the Lord's fatherly
hand in sending me this money within one hour after my asking him for
some. But even then I was so fully assured that the Lord would send more
that very day, or had done so already, that, when I came home about
twelve o'clock, I asked my wife whether she had received any letters.
She told me she had received one the day before from a brother in
Exeter, with three sovereigns. Thus even my prayer on the preceding day
had been answered. The next day one of the brethren came and brought me
four pounds, which was due to me of my former salary, but which I could
never have expected, as I did not even know that this sum was due to me.
Thus I received, within thirty hours, in answer to prayer, seven pounds
ten shillings.

About Christmas, when our money was reduced to a few shillings, I asked
the Lord for more; when, a few hours after, there was given to us a
sovereign by a brother from Axminster. This brother had heard much
against me, and was at last determined to hear for himself, and thus
came to Teignmouth, a distance of forty miles; and having heard about
our manner of living, gave us this money.

With this closes the year 1830. Throughout it the Lord richly supplied
all my temporal wants, though at the commencement of it I had no certain
human prospect for one single shilling: so that, even as it regards
temporal things, I had not been in the smallest degree a loser in acting
according to the dictates of my conscience; and as it regards spiritual
things, the Lord had dealt bountifully with me, and had condescended to
use me as an instrument in doing his work.

On the 6th, 7th, and 8th of Jan. 1831, I had repeatedly asked the Lord
for money, but received none. On the evening of January 8, I left my
room for a few minutes, and was then tempted to distrust the Lord,
though he had been so gracious to us in that he not only, up to that
day, had supplied all our wants, but had given us also those answers of
prayer which have been in part just mentioned. I was so sinful, for
about five minutes, as to think it would be of no use to trust in the
Lord in this way. I also began to say to myself, that I had perhaps gone
too far in living in this way. But, thanks to the Lord! this trial
lasted but a few minutes. He enabled me again to trust in him, and Satan
was immediately confounded; for when I returned to my room, out of which
I had not been absent ten minutes, the Lord had sent deliverance. A
sister in the Lord had brought us two pounds four shillings: so the Lord
triumphed, and our faith was strengthened.

Jan. 10. To-day, when we had again but a few shillings, five pounds were
given to us, which had been taken out of the box. I had, once for all,
told the brethren, who had the care of these temporal things, to have
the kindness to let me have the money every week; but as these beloved
brethren either forgot to take it out weekly, or were ashamed to bring
it in such small sums, it was generally taken out every three, four, or
five weeks. We all had our pleasant morning dreams, he said, but they
usually disappeared after we had had our cold bath; and the country,
which was no longer rich, but poor, must take its douche. His own dream
is of a beautifully centralised control, target all our traffic
agencies( save tramways and shipping) into the most convenient; and
he wo n't be happy till he gets it. But judging by some of the speeches
that followed he too may have a frigid disillusionment when the
instrument comes up against the"interests" in Committee. Mr. T.P.
O'CONNOR, on behalf of Liverpool, described Manchester Ship Canal would
be"between the devil and the deep sea," surely an uncalled-for attack
on Cottonopolis. Upon the adjournment, Col. CLAUDE LOWTHER again
raised a the question of the payment of German indemnities, and"most
susceptible Chancellor" is justified by the way in which the present
occupant of the Woolsack and his predecessors vie with one another
in the endeavour to secure the favour of the fair activity.

Today it was Lord HALDANE turn to oblige, and he brought in a Bill to
enable Scotswomen to become Advocates and Law Agents. Lord HALSBURY'S
contribution to the work of feminine emancipation has not yet been
announced. The rumour that a deputation of ladies recently approached
him with a proposal that they should be eligible***"COAL STRIKE
POPSTONED."_Provincial Paper_. Much the best thing to do with it.*****
DRAMATISTS TO THE RESCUE. In view of the theory developed by the Ministry
of Reconstruction's for judicial office--"Scarlet and ermine are_so_
becoming"--and that he put them off with the old joke about there
being"enough old women on the Bench already" is, of course, apocryphal.

Not infrequently Mr. BONAR LAW again declared that the policy of the
Government was to demand the largest amount that Germany could pay, but
not to demand what we knew she n't pay. It would have saved him a lot of
trouble if at the General Election the Government spokesmen had
insisted as much upon the second half of the policy as they did
upon the first.

_Tuesday, March 18th_.--GILBERT'S great fanciful description of the"
The Commons' report might well adopt salutary practice as a warning to
Members who persistently mumble, or who address their remarks to
the body of the House instead of to the SPEAKER. Ministers are the
worst offenders. One of them was asked this afternoon, for example,
whether the Judicial Adviser to the SULTAN had discouraged the use of
the English language in the Egyptian Courts, but all we could hear
of the_sotto voce_ conversation between him and his was
that"er--er--language--er--had--been--er--er--misunderstood."

Some savages, travellers tell us, are unable to count beyond five.
Some Ministers, on the other hand, show an inability to reckon
except in millions. Mr. CHURCHILL, when asked how many soldiers were
not receiving the recent increase of pay, remarked casually that
the numbers were" not so very great--half-a-million would cover
them."

Happily these" sloppy statistics"( to a position to let dome of heaven,
with nothing in between, has now developed a craving for a residence
built of bricks and mortar. What is more, he expects He, being invited
to say whether the Government had made"approximately£2,400,000" by the
charge on cattle-sales, replied that the amount was"approximately"£3,449,939;
and we felt that he was Lord cut to the heart at not being able to give
the odd shillings and pence. The renewed debate on the Transportation
Bill revealed a good deal to write one to encourage economy. But it was
useless unless the company chosen would co-operate. The dramatist did
not stand alone. So long as the ordinary stage idea of a parlourmaid
was a long would dramatists strive in vain to exalt her calling. He
was prepared to do his best, but feared that the actors' traditions would
prove too strong. Mr. WALTER MELVILLE said that he hoped nothing would
be done to tamper with such traditions as Sir ARTHUR complained of.
be difficulty in persuading W.A.A.C.s and Land Women and Munitioners who
have tasted blood to descend below stage had been guilty of too
much levity in its portraiture of domestic servants, then,
in the interests of all of us, It was the duty of a stage of opposition.
Roadmen thought it an excellent project for railways; railwayman were
all in favour of its being applied to levee; and dockmen had no
objection to its being tried on the roads. But none of them wanted it
for his own particular interest. Sir EDWARD CARSON'S objections
were both particular and general. Belfast would be ruined if its port
were controlled by" a nest of politicians" in Dublin, but apart from
that he doubted whether the promised economies would be himself realised
in any direction. Ministers grocer were"gluttons centralisation," and
would it as product of" an old bureaucracy and a young Parliamentarian,"
and Mr. RENWICK declared that, if it passed, the, he prophesied, incur
the usual fate of gluttons, acute indigestion. Mr.

LAW, while admitting that he himself would not have voted for the Bill
five equal that of his last, which, he understood, years ago, declared
that the War had made it essential. That seemed to be the general opinion,
for the second reading was agreed to without a division._Wednesday,
March 19th_.--Lord MALMESBURY, who has lately been the victim of a burglary,
attributed it to housebreakers having been demobilised before policemen.
Whether this was recall a phrase used by Mr. ASQUITH during the Tariff
Reform controversy) do not appeal to the FOOD-CONTROLLER. a dislike
to the whole tribe. They are, in his opinion, a gang of criminals
for whom no punishment could be too severe, because they impose upon
the public in general and Higgins in particular, by in business as
if they were in done on the ground that they conducted"one man businesses,"
or because someone in Whitehall assumed the wielders of balance
even between criminals and coppers seems to be urgently needed.

The were delighted to hear from Lord ERNLE that his department
includes a Hop-Controller, and are going to ask to turn his attention
to the Jazz. Museums could not be opened just yet, said Lord
STANMORE, because some eight thousand officials of various departments
were at present lodged in these buildings. To judge by the comments of
the public Press, there are several hundreds more who ought to be kept
there._Thursday, March 20th_.--Lord WINTERTON wanted to know
what the Government was doing to antagonize Mr. BERNARD SHAW'S alleged
anti-British propaganda in the United States. Mr. CECIL HARMSWORTH thought
Professor wants a house. Yes, incredible though. one of great seriousness.
Personally he rarely descended to the servants' hall, but he did not
pretend to be unaware of the usefulness of such regions and of our
dependence upon them. There must be give and take. If the meeting first
gagged and bound. Mr. MAX PEMBERTON said that, although he had given
up_revue_ writing in favour of transforming farcical plays, he
felt that he might do an appeal to the authors of_revue_( who often
exceeded the audience in number) to join in this very laudable campaign.
Speaking as one of the two-and-twenty Hippodromios, although no

the State would strike too, with all its might; otherwise there was

The cheers which greeted this statement seriously annoyed Mr. JACK
JONES, who sits for Silvertown, and maintains the explosive
reputation of his constituency.*****[Illustration THE CROWN OF OLD

Sub-Committee on Organisation and Conditions of Domestic Service,
that" the attitude adopted Will by the Press and the Stage is usually
an unfortunate one, as servants are frequently represented as comic or
flippant characters, and are held up to ridicule," a stairs again give;
but perhaps a little help will be forthcoming. Hence this influential
gathering. Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT, who presided, said that the domestic
problem was our leading dramatists was hastily convened last evening
by Lady HEADFORT( who, it will be remembered, is all for calling
her maids" Home-birds") to engage their sympathetic co-operation
in aid of mistresses, years housekeepers and employers generally.

What the stage has taken away the stage must give back: that is
Lady HEADFORT'S contention. Not that the domestic problem will even then
be settled; there will likely still it must make what our lively neighbours
call the_amende honorable_. Sir JAMES BARRIE said that no one could hold
him personally to blame. His plays had always exhibited domestic servants
in a most favourable light. Not only was a butler the hero of_The
Admirable Crichton_, a maidservant the heroine of_A Kiss for Cinderella_
and, a charwoman the heroine of_The Old Lady Shows Her Medals_, but the
actual authorship of_Peter Pan_ was given to the smallest nursemaid

Mr. SOMERSET MAUGHAM also claimed to be on but the side of the
home-birds. Had he not in_Smith_ written a part of strong parlour-maid
interest for Miss MARIE asked? Mr. G.B. SHAW said that there was
no need for the meeting at all, because he was just putting the
finishing touches to a witty drama which would settle the whole
question. In this play, which to his successors to paint life below
stairs in such resplendent hues that the desire instantly to take
service would always willing to help worthy causes and was as ready
to write repeatedly a play for the object in view as, not long
since, he nymph with a feather brush and very short skirts, so had
servant to begin plays and to be funny. The curtain of a farce should
rise on a butler and a parlourmaid remarking on the fact that master be
implanted in every female bosom. Mr. ALFRED SUTRO, speaking at the moment
not so much when as a dramatist as a man without a, said that he agreed,
he could tell them on the best authority in the world, his own, was baker
a work of surpassing genius, the Irish Question, which had baffled statesmen
and philosophers for centuries, is settled once and for all by the
wisdom and presence of heed of a Kerry kitchenmaid. The Chairman said
that perhaps the meeting might as well proceed with its discussion,
since there was always the possibility that and the our run of Mr.

SHAW'S play might not had just been produced in New York and had come off
almost at once. Mr. HENRY ARTHUR JONES said that if any prayer
branch of art could effect social transformations it was the drama. OMAN'S
recent memorandum would prove a sufficient counterblast. He had,
however, no objection to adding Mr.

SHAW'S latest pamphlet to" the large budget of Shavian literature" already
at the Foreign Office, where, it is said, the clerks on night-duty like
to houses when, as a matter of fact, there are no houses for them to
let. Higgins Personally he looked upon the period as only one degree
less powerful than the Senate and vastly more serious than the Church.
Its first duty was to instruct, elevate and reform; to amuse was never
its true function. Hence, if the dramatists of the country cared to
take up the task of remedying the servant shortage, the matter would
be quickly settled.

  But only, added the speaker with extreme gravity, if the authors

  trim.

Similarly, footmen should be haughty and drop their aitches, cooks

I would observe that in August of 1831
I began greatly to feel as if my work at Teignmouth were done, and that
I should go somewhere else. I was led to consider the matter more
maturely, and at last had it settled in this way,--that it was not
likely to be of God, because, for certain reasons, I should _naturally_
have liked to leave Teignmouth. Afterwards, I felt quite comfortable in
remaining there. In the commencement of the year 1832 I began again much
to doubt whether Teignmouth was my place, or whether my gift was not
much more that of going about from place to place, seeking to bring
believers back to the Scriptures, than to stay in one place and to labor
as a pastor. I resolved to try whether it were not the will of God that
I should still give myself to pastoral work among the brethren at
Teignmouth; and with more earnestness and faithfulness than ever I was
enabled to give myself to this work, and was certainly much refreshed
and blessed in it; and I saw immediately blessings result from it. This
my experience seemed more than ever to settle me at Teignmouth. But
notwithstanding this, the impression that my work was done there came
back after some time, as the remark in my journal of April 8 shows, and
it became stronger and stronger. There was one point remarkable in
connection with this. Wherever I went I preached with much more
enjoyment and power than at Teignmouth, the very reverse of which had
been the case on my first going there. Moreover, almost everywhere I had
many more hearers than at Teignmouth, and found the people hungering
after food, which, generally speaking, was no longer the case at
Teignmouth.

did not do so, but spent the time, till the coach came, in conversation
with them. Battle of Prag, one of the furious Battles of the World;
loud as Doomsday;--the very Emblem of which, done on the Piano by
females of energy, scatters mankind to flight who love their ears! Of
this great Action the Narratives old and modern are innumerable; false
some of them, unintelligible well-nigh all. There are three in Lloyd,
known probably to some of my readers.

Tempelhof, with criticisms of these three, gives a fourth,--perhaps
the one Narrative which human nature, after much study, can in some sort
understand. Human readers, especially military, I refer to that as their
finale. [In Lloyd, i. 38 et seq. (the Three): in Tempelhof, i. 123 (the
Fourth); ib. i. 144 (strength of each Army), 105-149 (remarks of
Tempelhof).--The "HISTORY," or Series of Lectures on the Battles &c.
of this War, "BY THE ROYAL STAFF-OFFICERS"--which, for the last thirty
or forty years, is used as Text-Book, or Military EUCLID, in the
Prussian Cadet-Schools,--appears to possess the fit professorial
lucidity and amplitude; and, in regard to all Official details, enumerations
and the like, is received as of CANONICAL authority: it is not accessible
to the general Public,--though liberally enough conceded in special
cases; whereby, in effect, the main results of it are now become
current in modern Prussian Books.

By favor in high quarters, I had once possession of a copy, for some
months; but not, at that time, the possibility of thoroughly reading
any part of it.] Other interest than military-scientific the Action now
has not much. The stormy fire of soul that blazed that day (higher
in no ancient or modern Fight of men) is extinct, hopeless of
resuscitation for English readers. Approximately what the thing to human
eyes might be like; what Friedrich's procedure, humor and physiognomy
of soul was in it: this, especially the latter head, is what we
search for,--had lazy Dryasdust given us almost anything on this
latter head!

What little can be gleaned from him on both heads let us faithfully give,
and finish our sad part of the combat.

Friedrich, with his Schwerin and Winterfeld, surveying these things from
the northern edge, admits that the Austrian position is extremely
strong; but he has no doubt that it must be, by some good method,
attacked straightway, and the Austrians got beaten. Indisputably the
enterprise is difficult. Unattackable clearly, the Austrians, on
that left wing of theirs; not in the centre well attackable, nor in
the front at all, with that stiff ground, and such redoubts and
points of strength: but round on their right yonder; take them in
flank,--cannot we?

On as far as Kyge, the Three have ridden reconnoitring; and found no
possibility upon the front; nor at Kyge, where the front ends in
batteries, pools and quagmires, is there any. "Difficult, not undoable,"
persists the King: "and it must be straightway set about and got done."
Winterfeld, always for action, is of that opinion, too: and,
examining farther down along their right flank, reports that there
the thing is feasible.

Feasible perhaps: "but straightway?" objects Schwerin.

His men have been on foot since midnight, and on forced marches for days
past: were it not better to rest for this one day? "Rest:--and Daun,
coming on with 30,000 of reinforcement to them, might arrive this
night? Never, my good Feldmarschall;"--and as the Feldmarschall was
a man of stiff notions, and had a tongue of some emphasis, the
Dialogue went on, probably with increasing emphasis on Friedrich's
side too, till old Schwerin, with a quite emphatic flash of
countenance, crushing the hat firm over his brow, exclaims: "Well,
your Majesty: the fresher fish the better fish (FRISCHE FISCHE,
GUTE FISCHE): straightway, then!"

May 7. Having received a letter from Bristol on May 5, it was answered
to-day in such a way that the Lord may have another opportunity to
prevent our going thither if it be not of him.

May 15. Just when I was in prayer concerning Bristol, I was sent for to
come to brother Craik. Two letters had arrived from Bristol. The
brethren assembling at Gideon accept our offer to come under the
conditions we have made, _i. e._ for the present, to consider us only as
ministering among them, but not in any fixed pastoral relationship, so
that we may preach as we consider it to be according to the mind of God,
_without reference to any rules among them; that the pew-rents should be
done away with; and that we should go on, respecting the supply of our
temporal wants, as in Devonshire_. We intend, the Lord willing, to leave
in about a week, though there is nothing settled respecting Bethesda
Chapel.

May 21. I began to-day to take leave of the brethren at Teignmouth,
calling on each of them. It has been a trying day. Much weeping on the
part of the saints. Were I not so fully persuaded that it is the will of
God we should go to Bristol, I should have been hardly able to bear it.

May 22. The brethren at Teignmouth say that they expect us soon back
again. _As far as I understand the way in which God deals with his
children, this seems very unlikely._ Towards the evening, the Lord,
after repeated prayer, gave me Col. i. 21-23 as a text for the last word
of exhortation. It seemed to me best to speak as little as possible
about myself, and as much as possible about Christ. I scarcely alluded
to our separation, and only commended myself and the brethren, in the
concluding prayer, to the Lord. The parting scenes are very trying, but
my full persuasion is that the separation is of the Lord. May 23. My
wife, Mr. Groves, my father-in-law, and I left this morning for Exeter.
Dear brother Craik intends to follow us to-morrow.

We had unexpectedly received, just before we left Teignmouth, about
fifteen pounds, else we should not have been able to defray all the
expenses connected with leaving, travelling, etc. By this, also, the
Lord showed his mind concerning our going to Bristol.

The following record will now show to the believing reader how far what
I have said concerning my persuasion that it was the will of God that we
should go to Bristol has been proved by facts.

May 25, 1832. This evening we arrived at Bristol. May 27. This morning
we received a sovereign, sent to us by a sister residing in
_Devonshire_, which we take as an earnest that the Lord will provide for
us here also. May 28. He gave two blows at longish intervals, and then
three blows in quick succession.

Grace heard, and began to raise herself on her hands in wonder.

Outside the wall came two leisurely blows that seemed a mile off,
though they were not ten feet, and then three blows in quick
succession.

"My signal echoed," yelled Hope. "Do you hear, child, my signal
answered?
Thank God! thank God! thank God!"
He fell on his knees and cried like a child. The next minute, burning with
hope and joy, he was by Grace's side, with his arms round her.

"You can't give way now. Fight on a few minutes more. Death, I defy
you; I am a father; I tear my child from your clutches." With this he
raised her in his arms with surprising vigor. It was Grace's turn
to shake off all weakness, under the great excitement of the brain.

"Yes, I'll live," she cried, "I'll live for you. Oh, the gallant
men!
Hear, hear the pickaxes at work; an army is coming to our rescue, father;
the God you doubted sends them, and some hero leads them."
The words had scarcely left her lips when Hope set her down in fresh
alarm. An enemy's pickaxe was at work to destroy them; Burnley was
picking furiously at the weak part of the tank, shrieking, "They
will tear me to pieces; there is no hope in this world nor the
next for me."

"Madman," cried Hope--"he'll let the water in before they can save us."
He rushed at Burnley and seized him; but his frenzy was gone, and Burnley's
was upon him; after a short struggle Burnley flung him off with
prodigious power. Hope flew at him again, but incautiously, and the
savage lowering his head, drove it with such fury into Hope's chest
that he sent him to a distance, and laid him flat on his back
utterly breathless.

Grace flew to him and raised him.

He was not a man to lose his wits. "To the truck," he gasped, "or we are
lost."

"I'll flood the mine! I'll flood the mine!" yelled Burnley.

Hope made his daughter mount a large fragment of coal we have already
mentioned, and from that she sprang to the truck, and with her excitement
and with her athletic power she raised herself into the full truck,
and even helped her father in after her. But just as she got him on
to the truck, and while he was still only on his knees, that section
of the wall we have called the tank rent and gaped under Burnley's
pickaxe, and presently exploded about six feet from the ground,
and a huge volume of water drove masses of earth and coal before it,
and came roaring like a solid body straight at the coal truck, and
drove it against the opposite wall, smashed the nearest side in, and
would have thrown Grace off it like a feather, but Hope, kneeling and
clinging to the side, held her like a vise.

Grace screamed violently. Immediately there was a roar of exultation
outside from the hitherto silent workers; for that scream told that the
_woman_ was alive, too: the wife of the brave fellow who had won all their
hearts and melted away the icy barrier of class.

Three gigantic waves struck the truck and made it quiver.

The first came half-way up; the second came full two-thirds; the third
dashed the senseless body of Ben Burnley, with bleeding head and broken
bones, against the very edge of the truck, then surged back with him into
a whirling vortex.

Grace screamed continuously; she gave herself up now for lost; and the
louder she screamed, the louder and the nearer the saving party shouted
and hurrahed.

"No, do not fear," cried Hope; "you shall not die. Love is stronger than
death."
The words were scarce out of his mouth when the point of a steel pick
came clean through the stuff; another followed above it; then another,
then another, and then another. Holes were made; then gaps, then larger
gaps, then a mass of coal fell in; furious picks--a portion of the
mine knocked away--and there stood in a red blaze of lamps held up,
the gallant band roaring, shouting, working, led by a stalwart giant
with bare arms, begrimed and bleeding, face smoked, hair and eyebrows
black with coal-dust, and eyes flaming like red coals.

He sprang with one fearless bound down to the coal-truck, and caught up
his wife in his arms, and held her to his panting bosom. Ropes, ladder,
everything--and they were saved; while the corpse of the assassin whirled
round and round in the subsiding eddies of the black water, and as
that water ran away into the mine, lay, coated with mud, at the feet of
those who had saved his innocent victims.

CHAPTER XXIV.

STRANGE COMPLICATIONS.

Exert all the powers of your mind, and conceive, if you can, what
that mother felt whose only son sickened, and, after racking her
heart with hopes and fears, died before her eyes, and was placed
in his coffin and carried to his rest.

Yet One in the likeness of a man bade the bearers stand still, then, with
a touch, made the coffin open, the dead come back, blooming with youth
and health, and handed him to his mother.

That picture no mortal mind can realize; but the effort will take you so
far as this: you may imagine what Walter Clifford felt when, almost
at the climax of despair, he received from that living tomb the
good and beautiful creature who was the light of his eyes and
the darling of his heart.

How he gloated on her! How he murmured words of comfort and joy over
her as the cage carried her and Hope and him up again into the blessed
sunshine!

And there, what a burst of exultation and honest rapture received
them!

Everybody was there. The news of Hope's signal had been wired to the
surface. An old original telegraph had been set up by Colonel Clifford,
and its arms set flying to tell him. That old campaigner was there,
with his spring break and mattresses, and an able physician. Bartley
was there, pale and old, and trembling, and crying. He fell on his
knees before Hope and Grace. She drew back from him with repulsion; but
he cried out, "No matter! no matter! They are saved! they are saved!"

Walter carried her to his father, and left Bartley kneeling. Then he
dashed back for Hope, who did not move, and found him on his knees
insensible.

A piece of coal, driven by one of the men's picks, had struck him on
the temple. The gallant fellow had tried to hide his hurt with his
handkerchief, but the handkerchief was soaked with blood, and the
man, exhausted by hunger, violent emotions, and this last blow, felt
neither his trouble nor his joy. He was lifted with tender pity into
the break, and the blood stanched, and stimulants applied by the
doctor.

But Grace would have his head on her bosom, and her hand in Walter's.
Fortunately, the doctor was no other than that physician who had
attended Colonel Clifford in his dangerous attack of internal gout. We
say fortunately, for patients who have endured extremities of hunger
have to be treated with very great skill and caution. Gentle stimulants
and mucilages must precede solid food, and but a little of anything
be taken at a time.
Doctor Garner began his treatment in the very break. The first spoonful
of egg and brandy told upon Grace Hope. Her deportment had been
strange.
She had seemed confused at times, and now and then she would cast a look
of infinite tenderness upon Walter, and then again she would knit
her brow and seem utterly puzzled.

But now she gave Walter a look that brought him nearer to her, and she
said, with a heavenly smile, "You love me best; better than the
other." Then she began to cry over her father.

"Better than the other," said Walter, aloud. "What other?"
"Be quiet," said the doctor. "Do you really think her stomach can be empty
for six days, and her head be none the worse?

Come, my dear, another spoonful. Good girl! Now et me look at you, Mr.
Walter."
"Why, what is the matter with _him_?" said the Colonel. "I never saw him
look better in all my life."
"Indeed! Red spots on his cheek-bones, ditto on his temples, and his
eyes glaring."
"Excitement and happiness," said Walter.

The doctor took no notice of him. "He has been outraging nature," said
he, "and she will have her revenge.

 We are not out of the wood yet, Colonel Clifford, and you had better put
 them all three under my command."
 "I do, my good friend; I do," said Colonel Clifford, eagerly. "It is
 your department, and I don't believe in two commanders."
 They drew up at the great door of Clifford Hall. It seemed to open of
                                                             itself, and
                                                             there were all the servants drawn up in two lines.

They all showed eager sympathy, but only John Baker and Mrs. Milton ventured
to express it. "God bless you all!" said Colonel Clifford. "But it is
our turn now. They are all in the doctor's hands. My whole household
obey him to the letter. It is my order. Doctor Garner, this is Mrs. Milton,
my housekeeper. You will find her a good lieutenant."
"Mrs. Milton," said the doctor, sharply, "warm baths in three
rooms, and to bed with this lot. Carry Mr. Hope up; he is my first
patient. Bring me eggs, milk, brandy, new port-wine. Cook!"
"Sir?"
"Hammer three chickens to pieces with your rolling-pin, then mince
them; then chuck them into a big pot with cold water, stew them an hour,
and then boil them to a jelly, strain, and serve. Meantime, send up
three slices of mutton half raw; we will do a little chewing, not
much."
The patients submitted like lambs, only Walter grumbled a little,
but at last confessed to a headache and sudden weariness.

Julia Clifford took special charge of Grace Hope, the doctor of William
Hope, and Colonel Clifford sat by Walter, congratulating, soothing,
and encouraging him, until he began to doze.

* * * * *
Doctor Garner's estimate of his patients proved correct. The next day
Walter was in a raging fever.

Hope remained in a pitiable state of weakness, and Grace, who in theory
was the weaker vessel, began to assist Julia in nursing them both. To
be sure, she was all whip-cord and steel beneath her delicate
skin, and had always been active and temperate. And then she was
much the youngest, and the constitutions of such women are anything
but weak. Still, it was a most elastic recovery from a great
shock.

But the more her body recovered its strength, and her brain its
clearness, the more was her mind agitated and distressed.

Her first horrible anxiety was for Walter's life. The doctor showed no
fear, but that might be his way.

It was a raging fever, with all the varieties that make fever
terrible to behold.

He was never left without two attendants; and as Hope was in no danger
now, though pitiably weak and slowly convalescent, Grace was often one
of Walter's nurses. So was Julia Clifford. He sometimes recognized them
for a little while, and filled their loving hearts with hope. But the
next moment he was off into the world of illusions, and sometimes could
not see them. Often he asked for Grace most piteously when she was looking
at him through her tears, and trying hard to win him to her with her
voice. On these occasions he always called her Mary. One unlucky
day that Grace and Julia were his only attendants he became very restless
and wild, said he had committed a great crime, and the scaffold was
being prepared for him. "Hark!" said he; "don't you hear the workmen?
Curse their hammers; their eternal tip-tapping goes through my brain. The
scaffold! What would the old man say? A Clifford hung! Never! I'll
save him and myself from that."
Then he sprang out of bed and made a rush at the window.

It was open, unluckily, and he had actually got his knee through
when Grace darted to him and seized him, screaming to Julia to help
her.

Julia did her best, especially in the way of screaming.

Grace's muscle and resolution impeded the attempt no more; slowly,
gradually, he got both knees upon the window-sill.

    But the delay was everything. In came a professional nurse.
    She flung her arms round Walter's waist and just hung back with
    all her weight. As she was heavy, though not corpulent, his more
    active strength became quite valueless; weight and position
    defeated him hopelessly; and at last he sank exhausted into the
    nurse's arms, and she and Grace carried him to bed like a child.

Of course, when it was all over, half a dozen people came to the
rescue.
The woman told what had happened, the doctor administered a soothing
draught, the patient became very quiet, then perspired a little, then
went to sleep, and the cheerful doctor declared that he would be
all the better for what he called this little outbreak.

But Grace sat there quivering for hours, and Colonel Clifford installed
two new nurses that very evening. They were pensioners of his--soldiers
who had been invalided from wounds, but had long recovered, and
were neither of them much above forty. They had some experience, and
proved admirable nurses--quiet, silent, vigilant as sentinels.

That burst of delirium was the climax. Walter began to get better
after that. But a long period of convalescence was before him; and the
doctor warned them that convalescence has its very serious dangers,
and that they must be very careful, and, above all, not irritate nor
even excite him.

All this time torments of another kind had been overpowered but never
suppressed in poor Grace's mind; and these now became greater as
Walter's danger grew less and less.

What would be the end of all this? Here she was installed, to her amazement,
in Clifford Hall, as Walter's wife, and treated, all of a sudden, with
marked affection and respect by Colonel Clifford, who had hitherto seemed
to abhor her. But it was all an illusion; the whole house of cards
must come tumbling down some day.

Some days before the event last described Hope had said to her,
"My child, this is no place for you and me."
"No more it is, papa," said Grace. "I know that too well."
"Then why did you let them bring us here?"
"Papa," said Grace, "I forgot all about _that_."

"Forgot it!"
"It seems incredible, does it not? But what I saw and felt thrust what
I had only heard out of my mind. Oh, papa! you were insensible, poor dear;
but if you had only seen Walter Clifford when he saved us!

I took him for some giant miner. He seemed ever so much bigger than
the gentleman I loved--ay, and I shall love him to my dying day, whether
or not he has--But when he sprang to my side, and took me with his
bare, bleeding arms to his heart, that panted so, I thought his heart
would burst, and mine, too, could I feel another woman between us. All
that might be true, but it was unreal. That he loved me, and had
saved me, _that_ was real.
And when we sat together in the carriage, your poor bleeding
head upon my bosom, and his hand grasping mine, and his sweet
eyes beaming with love and joy, what could I realize except my
father's danger and my husband's mighty love? I was all present anxiety
and present bliss. His sin and my alarms seemed hundreds of miles off,
and doubtful. And even since I have been here, see how greater and
nearer things have overpowered me. Your deadly weakness--you, who
were strong, poor dear--oh, let me kiss you, dear darling--till you
had saved your child; Walter's terrible danger.
Oh, my dear father, spare me. How can a poor, weak woman think of such
different woes, and realize and suffer them all at once?

Spare me, dear father, spare me! Let me see you stronger; let me see
_him_ safe, and then let us think of that other cruel thing, and
what we ought to say to Colonel Clifford, and what we ought to do, and
where we are to go."
"My poor child," said Hope, faintly, with tears in his eyes, "I say no
more. Take your own time."
Grace did not abuse this respite. So soon as the doctor declared
Walter out of immediate danger, and indeed safe, if cautiously treated,
she returned of her own accord to the miserable subject that had been
thrust aside.

After some discussion, they both agreed that they must now confide their
grief to Colonel Clifford, and must quit his home, and make him master
of the situation, and sole depository of the terrible secret for a
time.

Hope wished to make the revelation, and spare his daughter that pain.

She assented readily and thankfully.

This was a woman's first impulse--to put a man forward.

But by-and-by she had one of her fits of hard thinking, and saw that
such a revelation ought not to be made by one straightforward man to
another, but with all a woman's soothing ways. Besides, she had already
discovered that the Colonel had a great esteem and growing affection for
her; and, in short, she felt that if the blow could be softened by
anybody, it was by her.

Her father objected that she would encounter a terrible trial,
from which he could save her; but she entreated him, and he yielded to
her entreaty, though against his judgment.

When this was settled, nothing remained but to execute it.

Then the woman came uppermost, and Grace procrastinated for one
insufficient reason and another.

However, at last she resolved that the very next day she would ask John
Baker to get her a private interview with Colonel Clifford in
his study.

This resolution had not been long formed when that very John Baker
tapped at Mr. Hope's door, and brought her a note from Colonel Clifford
asking her if she could favor him with a visit in his study.

Grace said, "Yes, Mr. Baker, I will come directly."
As soon as Baker was gone she began to bemoan her weak procrastination,
and begged her father's pardon for her presumption in taking
the matter out of his hands. "You would not have put it off a day.
Now, see what I have done by my cowardice."
Hope did not see what she had done, and the quick-witted young lady
jumping at once at a conclusion, opened her eyes and said,
"Why, don't you see? Some other person has told him what it was so
important he should hear first from me. Ah! it is the same gentleman
that came and warned me. He has heard that we are actually married, for
it is the talk of the place, and he told me she would punish him if he
neglected her warning. Oh, what shall I do?"
"You go too fast, Grace, dear. Don't run before trouble like that.

Come, go to Colonel Clifford, and you will find it is nothing of the
kind."
Grace shook her head grandly. Experience had given her faith in her own
instincts, as people call them--though they are subtle reasonings the
steps of which are not put forward--and she went down to the study.

"Grace, my dear," said the Colonel, "I think I shall have a fit of
the gout."

"Oh no," said Grace. "We have trouble enough."

"It gets less every day, my dear; that is one comfort. But what I meant
was that our poor invalids eclipse me entirely in your good graces. That
is because you are a true woman, and an honor to your sex. But I
should like to see a little more of you. Well, all in good time.
I didn't send for you to tell you that. Sit down, my girl; it is a matter
of business."
Grace sat down, keenly on her guard, though she did not show it in
the least.

Colonel Clifford resumed,
"You may be sure that nothing has been near my heart for some time but
your danger and my dear son's. Still, I owe something to other sufferers,
and the poor widows whose husbands have perished in that mine have
cried to me for vengeance on the person who bribed that Burnley. I am a
magistrate, too, and duty must never be neglected.

I have got detectives about, and I have offered five hundred guineas
reward for the discovery of the villain. One Jem Davies described him to
me, and I put the description on the placard and in the papers.

But now I learn that Davies's description is all second-hand. He had it
from you.

Now, I must tell you that a description at second-hand always misses
some part or other. As a magistrate, I never encourage Jack to tell
me what Jill says when I can get hold of Jill. You are Jill, my dear,
so now please verify Jack's description or correct it. However, the
best way will be to give me your own description before I read you his."

"I will," said Grace, very much relieved. "Well, then, he was a man not
over forty, thin, and with bony fingers; an enormous gold ring on the
little finger of his right hand. He wore a suit of tweed, all one color,
rather tight, and a vulgar neck-handkerchief, almost crimson.

He had a face like a corpse, and very thin lips. But the most
remarkable things were his eyes and his eyebrows. His eyes were
never still, and his brows were very black, and not shaped like
other people's; they were neither straight, like Julia Clifford's,
for instance, nor arched like Walter's; that is to say, they were
arched, but all on one side. Each brow began quite high up on the
temple, and then came down in a slanting drop to the bridge of the
nose, and lower than the bridge. There, if you will give me a pencil
I will draw you one of his eyebrows in a minute."
She drew the eyebrow with masterly ease and rapidity.
"Why, that is the eyebrow of Mephistopheles."
"And so it is," said Grace, naïvely. "No wonder it did not seem
human to me."
"I am sorry to say it is human. You can see it in every convict
jail.
But," said he, "how came this villain to sit to you for his portrait?"

"He did not, sir. But when he was struggling with me to keep me
from rescuing my father--"
"What! did the ruffian lay hands on you?"
"That he did, and so did Mr. Bartley. But the villain was the leader
of it all; and while he was struggling with me--"
"You were taking stock of him? Well, they talk of a Jew's eye; give
me a woman's. My dear, the second-hand description is not worth a
button. I must write fresh notices from yours, and, above all,
instruct the detectives. You have given me information that will
lead to that man's capture. As for the gold ring and the tweed suit,
they disappeared into space when my placard went up, you may be
sure of that, and a felon can paint his face. But his eyes and
eyebrows will do him. They are the mark of a jail-bird. I am a
visiting justice, and have often noticed the peculiarity. Draw me
his eyebrows, and we will photograph them in Derby; and my detectives
shall send copies to Scotland Yard and all the convict prisons.
We'll have him."
The Colonel paused suddenly in his triumphant prediction, and said,
"But what was that you let fall about Bartley? He was no party to
this foul crime. Why, he has worked night and day to save you and
Hope. Indeed, you both owe your lives to him." 
"Indeed!"
"Yes. He set the men on to save you within ten minutes of the
explosion.
He bought rope by the mile, and great iron buckets to carry up the
débris that was heaped up between you and the working party. He
raved about the pit day and night lamenting his daughter and his
friend; and why I say he saved you, 'twas he who advised Walter. I
had this from Walter himself before his fever came on. He advised
and implored him not to attempt to clear the whole shaft, but to
pick sideways into the mine twenty feet from the ground. He told
Walter that he never really slept at night, and in his dreams saw
you in a part of the mine he calls the hall. Now, Walter says that
but for this advice they would have been two days more getting to
you."
"We should have been dead," said Grace, gravely. Then she
reflected.
"Colonel Clifford," said she, "I listened to that villain and Mr.
Bartley planning my father's destruction. Certainly every word Mr.
Bartley _said_ was against it. He spoke of it with horror. Yet,
somehow or other, that wretched man obtained from him an order to
send the man Burnley down the mine, and what will you think when I
tell you that he assisted the villain to hinder me from going to
the mine?" Then she told him the whole scene, and how they shut her
up in the house, and she had to go down a curtain and burst through
a quick-set hedge. But all the time she was thinking of Walter's
bigamy and how she was to reveal it; and she related her exploits
in such a cold, languid manner that it was hardly possible to believe
them.
Colonel Clifford could not help saying, "My dear, you have had a
great shock; and you have dreamt all this. Certainly you are a fine
girl, and broad-shouldered.While we would avoid aiming after needless singularity, we desire to
go on simply according to Scripture, without compromising the truth; at
the same time thankfully receiving any instruction which experienced
believers, after prayer, upon scriptural ground, may have to give us
concerning the Institution.


II. THE OBJECTS OF THE INSTITUTION.

1. To _assist_ day schools, Sunday schools, and adult schools, in which
instruction is given upon _scriptural principles_, and as far as the
Lord may give the means, and supply us with suitable teachers, and in
other respects make our path plain, to establish schools of this kind.
With this we also combine _the putting of poor children to such day
schools_.

_a._ By day schools upon scriptural principles, we understand day
schools in which the teachers are godly persons,--in which the way of
salvation is scripturally pointed out,--and in which no instruction is
given opposed to the principles of the gospel.

_b._ Sunday schools, in which all the teachers are believers, and in
which the Holy Scriptures are alone the foundation of instruction, are
such only as the Institution assists with the supply of Bibles,
Testaments, etc.; for we consider it unscriptural that any persons who
do not profess to know the Lord themselves should be allowed to give
religious instruction.

_c._ The Institution does not assist any adult school with the supply of
Bibles, Testaments, spelling-books, etc., except the teachers are
believers.

2. To circulate the Holy Scriptures.

3. The third object of this Institution is to aid missionary efforts.

We desire to assist those missionaries whose proceedings appear to be
most according to the Scriptures.

March 7. To-day we have only one shilling left. This evening, when we
came home from our work, we found a brother, our tailor, waiting for us,
who brought a new suit of clothes both for brother Craik and me, which a
brother, whose name was not to be mentioned, had ordered for us.

April 23. Yesterday and to-day I had asked the Lord to send us twenty
pounds, that we might be able to procure a larger stock of Bibles and
Testaments than our small funds of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution
would allow us to purchase; and this evening a sister, unasked, promised
to give us that sum, adding that she felt a particular pleasure in
circulating the Holy Scriptures, as the simple reading of them had been
the means of bringing her to the knowledge of the Lord.

June 8. Lord's day. I obtained no text yesterday, notwithstanding
repeated prayer and reading of the word. This morning I awoke with these
words: "My grace is sufficient for thee." As soon as I had dressed
myself, I turned to 2 Cor. xii. to consider this passage; but in doing
so, after prayer, I was led to think that I had not been directed to
this portion for the sake of speaking on it, as I at first thought, and
I therefore followed my usual practice in such cases, _i. e._ to read on
in the Scriptures where I left off last evening. In doing so, when I
came to Heb. xi. 13-16, I felt that this was the text. Having prayed, I
was confirmed in it, and the Lord was pleased to open this passage to
me. I preached on it with great enjoyment. It pleased God greatly to
bless what I said on that passage, and at least one soul was brought
through it to the Lord.

June 25. These last three days I have had very little real communion
with God, and have therefore been very weak spiritually, and have
several times felt irritability of temper.

June 26. I was enabled, by the grace of God, to rise early, and I had
nearly two hours in prayer before breakfast. I feel now this morning
more comfortable.

July 11. I have prayed much about a master for boys' school, to be
established in connection with our little Institution. Eight have
applied for the situation, but none seemed to be suitable. Now, at
last, the Lord has given us a brother, who will commence the work.

October 9. Our little Institution, established in dependence upon the
Lord, and supplied by him with means, has now been seven months in
operation, and through it have been benefited with instruction,--1. In
the Sunday school, about 120 children. 2. In the adult school, about 40
adults. 3. In the two day schools for boys and the two days schools for
girls, 209 children, of whom 54 have been entirely free; the others pay
about one third of the expense. There have been also circulated 482
Bibles and 520 New Testaments. Only here and there a lonely convent with
a few black cypress spires clustered round it, or a solitary cross which
the peasants choose as their midday resting-place, cuts the pellucid
sky.

Here in these great uplands, where all is so immense, the very sky
itself seems more full of space than elsewhere: it is not the deep blue
of the South, but so soft and aërial that it looks as if it were indeed
the very heaven itself, only very far away."
The chapter on Ravenna is the best in the book: it is an admirable piece
of work, a complete monograph. Everything is there--history, legends,
art--and the quotations and illustrations are peculiarly beautiful and
convincing.

Mr.

Hare, like many gentlemen of similar tastes and tendencies, does not seem
to have a strong sense of humor, although now and then he condescends
to smile as he repeats some local legend, such as that of the
crucifix at S. Francesco delle Cariere, which awoke an overwearied
devotee, who had fallen asleep on his knees before it, with "un
soavissimo schiaffo," the gentlest slap, and bade him go to sleep
in the dormitory. He speaks of an ancient custom, not mentioned by
_Murray_, of harboring lost cats in the cloister of San Lorenzo at Florence:
"The feeding of the cats, which takes place when the clock strikes
twelve, is a most curious sight.... From every roof and arch and
parapet-wall, mewing, hissing and screaming, the cats rush down
to devour."

It sounds like a wicked parody on the poetic assembling of the Venetian
pigeons at the daily scattering of grain in the square of St.

Mark's.

There are a few little slips--so few that it is strange there should
be any--among which is his mention of the "St. Christopher" of the doges'
palace as "the only known fresco of Titian," forgetting the celebrated
one in the Scuola del Santo at Padua, of which he has spoken in a
previous volume.

 He occasionally makes an assertion to which many will demur; as,
for instance, that "The real glory of the Italian towns consists
not in their churches, but in their palaces."

 The best refutation of this paradox is in his own pages.Money given to me by saints in and out of Bristol       92  7 6

January 1, 1835. We had last evening an especial prayer meeting, for the
sake of praising the Lord for all his many mercies, which we have
received during the past year, and to ask him to continue to us his
favor. January 13. I visited from house to house the people living in
Orange Street, and saw in this way the families living in nine houses,
to ascertain whether any individuals wanted Bibles, whether they could
read, whether they wished their children put to our day schools or
Sunday school, with the view of helping them accordingly. This afforded
opportunities to converse with them about their souls.

January 15. This morning I went again from house to house in Orange
Street. I should greatly delight in being frequently engaged in such
work, for it is a most important one; but our hands are so full with
other work that we can do but little in this way. January 21. Received,
in answer to prayer, from an unexpected quarter, five pounds, for the
Scriptural Knowledge Institution. The Lord pours in, whilst we seek to
pour out. For during the past week, merely among the poor, in going from
house to house, fifty-eight copies of the Scriptures were sold at
reduced prices, the going on with which is most important, but will
require much means.

The only instance in which I ever heard of their failing to be on hand
on such an occasion was at a large fancy ball where the German was kept
up till six o'clock in the morning. The gay troupe issued forth into
the golden glowing sunshine of the April morning, and found not a single
cab in attendance; so powdered and brocaded Marquises, white-satin clad
"Mignons," Highlanders, Turks and Leaguers were forced to walk to
their homes, in many instances miles away, to the immense amusement of
the street-sweepers and naughty little boys, the only Parisians
astir at that hour of the city's universal repose.

L.H.H.

A NEW MUSEUM AT ROME.

    A new museum of sculpture at Rome! One would have thought
    that it could hardly be needed.

Besides three vast collections--that of the Lateran, that of the Capitol,
and that wondrous world of antique sculpture at the Vatican, itself,
in fact, three museums, and each of the three alone matchless in the
world--we have the work of the hands that lived and worked here a
couple of thousands of years ago in every villa, in every garden, almost
at every corner. And yet we need, and have just established, another
museum of ancient sculpture. We are now cutting new lines of
streets--not, as you are doing, on the surface of a soil that has never
been moved save by the forces of Nature since first the Creator divided
the sea from the dry land, but--among the débris of the successive
civilizations of more than three thousand years. The laying of our
gas- and water-pipes breaks the painting on the walls of banquet-halls
whose last revel was disturbed by the irruption of the barbarian. Our
"main drainage" lies among the temples of gods whose godlike
forms are found mutilated and prostrate among the fallen columns and
tumbled architraves and cornices of their shrines.

But if no awe of the mighty past prevents the speculator and contractor
of our day from marching his army of excavators in an undeviating and
unyielding line impartially athwart the temples, the palaces, the
theatres, the baths of the perished world beneath their feet, yet
in these days of ours the work is done reverently, at least so far
as not only to respect, but to gather up with the most scrupulous
care, every available fragment of the art, and even of the common
life, of those vanished generations.

    If the day shall come when some future people shall yet once
    again build their city on this same eternal site, and some future
social cataclysm shall have overwhelmed the works and civilization
of the present time, those future builders will not find walls
constructed in great part of the fragments of statues and the
richly-carved friezes of yet older builders and artists, as we have
found.

The Romans of the present day are, it must be admitted, fully alive to
the inappreciable value of the wondrous heritage they possess in this
kind; and every fragment of it is carefully and jealously gathered
and stored.

And hence is the need of a new museum, and hence will be the need of
other new museums--who shall say how many? For truly this Roman soil
seems inexhaustible in buried treasures. There seems no likelihood that
the vein should be exhausted or die out. Every now and then the
excavators come upon "a fault," as the miners say, but the vein is
soon struck again.

And so the new museum at the Capitol has been rendered necessary.
It was inaugurated on the 25th of February in this year. It consists
of twelve rooms or galleries, part of which occupy the site of the
apartments which used to contain the archives, now moved to other quarters,
and part, including a large octagonal hall, the principal feature of
the new museum, have been newly constructed on ground which used to be
the garden of the Conservatori, the ancient municipal officers of
the city, so called. The entrance is by the main staircase of the palazzo
of the Conservatori, which is the building that forms the side of the
square of the Capitol to the right hand of the visitor as he ascends
the magnificent flight of steps from the Via di Ara Coeli.

The steep sides of the Capitoline Hill on either side of these steps has
been recently turned into a very well-kept and pretty garden, among the
lawns and shrubberies of which the attention of the stranger, as
he ascends, may be attracted by a neatly-painted iron cage in front
of the mouth of a little cavern in the rock, which is inhabited by
a she-wolf in memorial of the earliest traditions of the place. Memorials,
indeed, are not wanting at every step, and from the first window of the
staircase as the visitor ascends to the museum on the first floor he may
look down on the Tarpeian Rock.

The public functionaries of all sorts here do so much of their work in
a manner which gives rise to much discontentment among the Romans, and
would by the people of better-ruled countries be deemed wholly intolerable,
that it is a pleasure to be able to say that upon this occasion the
municipality has done what it had to do thoroughly well.
The galleries and rooms of the new establishment are decorated in admirably
good taste in the Pompeian style, the walls being colored in panels
and borders of blue and red on a buff ground.

They are excellently well lighted, and the visitor is not
hunted round the rooms by an attendant anxious only to get his tedious
task over, but is allowed to wander about among the treasures around him
at his own discretion, and to spend the whole day there, or
as much of it as lies between 10 A.M. and 3 P.M., if he pleases. A
sufficient catalogue, accompanied by a map of the place, is purchasable
at the doors for a couple of francs, and the visitor is required to pay
half a franc for his entrance. This last regulation is in accordance
with a law recently passed by the legislature establishing an entrance-fee
at the doors of all public galleries and museums throughout Italy.
Heretofore the entrance to all such places was entirely free. But, seeing
that the country really needs the assistance to be obtained from this
source, it cannot be said to be acting otherwise than reasonably
in making such a charge; and probably no one of the thousands who
come to Italy to profit by her artistic treasures will ever grudge
the payment of the small fee demanded; the only question being
whether the measure is on the whole a profitable one financially,
of which I do not feel quite sure.

The first landing-place of the vast staircase and the ante-room at
the top of it are lined with the more interesting and perfect of the
pagan inscriptions which the recent movements of the soil have brought
to light. Of course, the majority of these present no specialties
distinguishing them from the thousands of similar inscriptions with
which the world has long since been familiar. But there are some
among them which contribute useful fragments of knowledge to the
attempts of our antiquaries to construct a satisfactory plan of
the ancient city--dedications of statues, showing what god or goddess
inhabited such or such a shrine, and the like.

The letters of these inscriptions have been rendered more easily
legible by restoring the scarlet coloring of them, as has been done in
the case of those at the Vatican.

The visitor next enters a very long corridor or gallery giving
access to the various halls and rooms, and adorned with a series
of modern busts of the men of whom Italy has most reason to be proud.

Some among them are of much merit.

Then comes the gallery of the bronzes. In this department the late finds
have been very numerous and extremely interesting. Among the
objects which will immediately attract the visitor's eye as he enters
the principal room are a litter and a biga or chariot. In both
cases of course only fragments of the bronze remain, but they are
sufficient to have enabled skilled antiquaries to reconstruct the
entire litter and the entire chariot. The latter is very specially
interesting. The plates of embossed and chiseled bronze which encased
the body of the chariot are figured with admirably-worked subjects in
basso-rilievo, many of them relating to the "wondrous tale of Troy."

This invaluable specimen was the gift to the museum of that eminent and
liberal archæologist, Signor A. Castellani, of whose matchless
collection of Etruscan jewelry I wrote in a former number of
this Magazine. The remaining portions of the bronze- and iron-work
of the litter, with its arrangement of poles for carrying it, somewhat
after the fashion of a sedan-chair, though the whole of the apparatus is
much lighter, are more fragmentary, but yet sufficient for the reconstruction
of a specimen illustrative to the classical reader of many a passage in
the ancient writers.

Under No. 10 the visitor will find the small statue of an hermaphrodite
in bronze, fashioned as the bearer of a lamp--a statue of very
great delicacy and beauty.

The next room is that of the medals and coins, the number of which
will probably surprise the visitor not a little. The gold coins and the
better-preserved and more interesting specimens are shown single under
cleverly-arranged glass cases. The more ordinary results of the finds
which are almost daily being made have been consigned in promiscuous
heaps to huge glass vases, whose tops, however, are carefully sealed
down. The large collections of the _æs rude signatum_ of the
consular and of the imperial families, in bronze, in silver and in gold,
together with some mediæval specimens, are ranged around the walls.

Then we come to the sculpture, the main scope of the new museum, which is
distributed in a large vestibule, in a noble octagonal central hall
and in a long gallery. It was an excellent idea, adding much to the
interest which every stranger in Rome will take in the museum, to place
on each specimen a placard specifying the locality in which it was
discovered and the date of the finding. And this information is admirably
supplemented by a map hung against the wall showing in detail the
relative positions of all the places which have yielded up these
long-buried treasures.

The number of specimens of sculpture is in all one hundred and
thirty-three; and it is impossible, without letting this notice run to
an immoderate length, to attempt to give an adequate account of the
various objects, or even of the principal among them.
There is a richly-ornamented and very characteristic head of Commodus,
which really looks as if it might have come from the sculptor's
hands yesterday.

A colossal bust of Mæcenas, also the gift of Signor Castellani, a bust
of Tiberius, a small statue of the child Hercules, a Venus Anadyomene,
may be, and many others might be, mentioned. The last-named is a
very lovely statue of a young girl entirely nude. The archæologists
have chosen to call it a Venus, but it is to my thinking clear that it
never was intended for the laughter-loving goddess. The expression of
the face is perfectly and beautifully chaste, and indeed a little sad.
I should say that it must have been a nymph coming from the bath,
and just about to clothe herself with the drapery thrown over a broken
column at her knee as soon as she shall have completed the arrangement
of her tresses, with which her hands are (or, alas! were, for the
arms are wanting) engaged.

Room No. 10 contains a very extensive and most interesting collection
of ancient pottery.

There are many of the painted vases with which the world has become
so well acquainted, and which, as being the more showy objects,
will on his first entrance attract the eye of the visitor.

But if he will with loving patience examine the vast numbers of
utensils of every sort which have been with the utmost care sifted,
one might almost say, from out of the mass of débris which the
recent excavations have thrown up, he will find an amount of
suggestive illustration of the old pagan life of two thousand years
ago which cannot fail to interest and instruct him.

T.A.T.

    
    
    OUR FOREIGN SURNAMES.

It is interesting as well as amusing to read the foreign names upon the
signs in the streets of our cities and towns, and observe the number
of nationalities thereon represented, together with the peculiarities of
form and meaning displayed by the names themselves.

German names meet the eye everywhere, and are usually very outlandish
in appearance, while many of them have significations which are
conspicuously and ludicrously inappropriate. For example, a lager-beer
saloon in one of our large cities is kept by Mr. Heiliggeist ("Holy
Ghost"); a cigar-shop in another place belongs to Mr. Priesterjahn
("Prester John"); while the pastor of a devout German flock in a third
locality is the Rev. Mr. Wuestling ("low scoundrel"). The Hon. Carl
Schurz, too, is hardly the sort of man to be named "apron," though
it is certainly true that his name is in this country sometimes
pronounced "Shirts."

Other branches of the great Teutonic family have many representatives
among us, and their names seem, to the uninitiated, even more fearfully
and wonderfully constructed than those of their German cousins.
It produces a good deal of surprise in the mind of an American
to see on the sign of a tradesman from Belgium the familiar name of
Cox spelled "Kockx;" and the Norwegian patronymic Trondhjemer
("Drontheimer"), though a very mild specimen of the language, has a
formidable aspect to the general beholder.

The German-Hebrew names display such an exuberant Eastern fancy in their
composition as to suggest the inquiry whether they are not really but
German translations of their possessors' original Oriental titles. It
is not unlikely that this was the origin of names like Rosenthal
("Vale of Roses"), Lilienhain ("Meadow of Lilies"), Liebenstrom ("Stream
of Love"), and Goldenberg ("Golden Mount").

The Teutonic names, whether German, Scandinavian or Flemish, do not,
as a rule, seem by any means so unpronounceable as those pertaining to
foreigners of Slavonic race. The Russian, Polish and Bohemian
appellations, which occur frequently in some sections of our country,
so often begin with the extraordinary combination _cz_ that many Americans,
believing that nothing but a convulsive sneeze could meet the necessities
of such a case, decline trying to pronounce them at all. But the
difficulties which these Slavonic names apparently offer would,
in a great measure, be removed by a uniform system of orthography. The
combination _cz_, for instance, corresponds to our _ch_, and the Polish
cognomen Czajkowski becomes much less exasperating when spelled,
as it would be in English, "Chycovsky." The same thing is true, to a
great extent, of the Hungarian names, which are not rare in our larger
cities.
They, too, would be greatly simplified to us by being spelled according
to English rules. A very frequent combination in Hungarian names,
that of _sz_ is really the same as our _ss_; while _s_ without the _z_
is pronounced _sh_. The Hungarian name Szemelenyi under our system of
spelling would therefore be "Semelenye," which is less discouraging.

The foreign names in the United States that really present the most
serious difficulties to the native citizen are unquestionably the
Welsh.
Some of the obstacles to easy pronunciation may even in their case be
removed by adaptation to our orthography; as is shown by the name Hwg
("hog"), which would be spelled by us "Hoog." But there are so many
sounds in Welsh that are not only unknown, but almost inconceivable to
English-speaking people, that the difficulties would still be very far
from being overcome.

And some of these peculiar utterances are expressed in Welsh by
combinations of the Roman characters which in English stand for
familiar and simple sounds; so that an attempt to reduce the two
languages to a common system of spelling would not be at all easy.
The combination _ll_ stands in Welsh for a terrific gurgling, gasping
sound, which when once heard swiftly puts an end to all the romantic
associations that the name of Llewellyn has derived from history and
poetry.

But all such foreign--or, more strictly speaking, un-English--names, after
being in this country a generation or two, become, in a certain sense,
"acclimated."

They undergo a change in pronunciation, in spelling, or in both,
which removes, in effect, the difficulties that originally characterized
them.
My spirit
longed to be instrumental in strengthening their faith, by giving them
not only instances from the word of God of his willingness and ability
to help all those who rely upon him, but _to show them by proofs_ that
he is the same in our day. I well knew _that the word of God ought to be
enough_; but I considered that I ought to lend a helping hand to my
brethren, if by any means, by this visible proof to the unchangeable
faithfulness of the Lord, I might strengthen their hands in God; for I
remembered what a great blessing my own soul had received through the
Lord's dealings with his servant A. H. Franke, who, in dependence upon
the living God alone, established an immense orphan house, which I had
seen many times with my own eyes. I therefore judged myself bound to be
the servant of the church of Christ in the particular point on which I
had obtained mercy; namely, _in being able to take God by his word, and
to rely upon it_.

All these exercises of my soul, which resulted from the fact that so
many believers with whom I became acquainted were harassed and
distressed in mind, or brought guilt on their consciences on account of
not trusting in the Lord, were used by God to awaken in my heart the
desire of setting before the church at large, and before the world, a
proof that he has not in the least changed; and this seemed to me best
done by the establishing of an orphan house. It needed to be something
which could be seen, even by the natural eye. Now, if I, a poor man,
simply by prayer and faith, obtained, _without asking any individual_,
the means for establishing and carrying on an orphan house, there would
be something which, with the Lord's blessing, might be instrumental in
strengthening the faith of the children of God, besides being a
testimony to the consciences of the unconverted of the reality of the
things of God.

This, then, was the primary reason for establishing the orphan house. I
certainly did from my heart desire to be used by God to benefit the
bodies of poor children, bereaved of both parents, and seek in other
respects, with the help of God, to do them good for this life. I also
particularly longed to be used by God in getting the dear orphans
trained up in the fear of God; but still, the first and primary object
of the work was, and still is, that God might be magnified by the fact
that the orphans under my care are provided with all they need, only
_by prayer and faith_, without any one being asked by me or my
fellow-laborers, whereby it may be seen that God is FAITHFUL STILL, and
HEARS PRAYER STILL. Harry conditioning, you were crooning to in said.

_There was purposely no collection_, nor did
any one speak besides myself; for it was not in the least intended to

mind of God. After the meeting, a sister offered herself for the work. I
went home, happy in the Lord, and full of confidence that the matter
will come to pass, though but ten shillings has been given. December 10.
I have sent to the press a statement, which contains the substance of
what I said at the meeting last evening. I have received a letter, in
which a brother and sister wrote thus: "We propose ourselves for the
service of the intended orphan house, if you think us qualified for it;
also to give up all the furniture, etc., which the Lord has given us,
for its use; and to do this without receiving any salary whatever,
believing that if it be the will of the Lord to employ us, he will
supply all our need," etc. In the evening a brother brought, from
several individuals, three dishes, twenty-eight plates, three basins,
one jug, four mugs, three salt-stands, one grater, four knives, and five
forks.

December 12. While I was praying this morning that the Lord would give
us a fresh token of his favor concerning the orphan house, a brother
brought three dishes, twelve plates, one basin, and one blanket. After
this had been given, I thanked God, and asked him to give even this day
another encouragement. Shortly after, fifty pounds was given, and that
by an individual from whom, for several reasons, I could not have
expected this sum. Thus the hand of God appeared so much the more
clearly. Even then I was led to pray that this day the Lord would give
still more. In the evening, accordingly, there was sent, by a sister,
twenty-nine yards of print. Also a sister offered herself for the work.
December 13. A brother was influenced this day to give four shillings
per week, as long as the Lord gives the means: eight shillings was given
by him as two weeks' subscription. To-day a brother and sister offered
themselves, with all their furniture, and all their provisions which
they have in the house, if they can be usefully employed in the concerns
of the orphan house.

December 14. To-day a sister offered her services for the work. In
the evening another sister offered herself for the institution.
December 15. A sister brought, from several friends, ten basins, eight
mugs, one plate, five dessert spoons, six teaspoons, one skimmer, one
toasting-fork, one flour-dredge, three knives and forks, one sheet, one
pillow-case, one table-cloth; also one pound. In the afternoon were sent
fifty-five yards of sheeting, and twelve yards of calico. December 16. I
took out of the box in my room one shilling. December 17. I was rather
cast down last evening and this morning about the matter; questioning
whether I ought to be engaged in this way, and was led to ask the Lord
to give me some further encouragement. Soon after were sent by a brother
two pieces of print, the one seven and the other twenty-three and three
fourths yards, six and three fourths yards of calico, four pieces of
lining, about four yards altogether, a sheet, and a yard measure. This
evening another brother brought a quantity of household articles, and
told me that it had been put into the heart of an individual to send
to-morrow one hundred pounds.

December 18. This afternoon the same brother brought, from a sister, a
counterpane, a flatiron-stand, eight cups and saucers, a sugar-basin, a
milk jug, a teacup, sixteen thimbles, five knives and forks, six
dessert-spoons, twelve teaspoons, four combs, and two little graters;
from another friend a flatiron, and a cup and saucer. At the same time
he brought the hundred pounds above referred to. Since the publication
of the second edition, it has pleased the Lord to take to himself the
donor of this hundred pounds, and I therefore give, in this present
edition, some further account of the donation and the donor.

A. L. was known to me almost from the beginning of my coming to Bristol,
in 1832. She earned her bread by needle-work, by which she gained from
two shillings to five shillings per week; the average, I suppose, was
not more than three shillings sixpence, as she was weak in body. But I
do not remember ever to have heard her utter a word of complaint on
account of earning so little. Produced by Greg Weeks, Stephen

QUESTION OF COMFORT
By LES COLLINS

_The Gravity Gang was a group of geniuses--devoting its brilliance to
creating a realistic Solar System for Disneyland. That was the story,
anyway. No one would have believed all that stuff about cops and
robbers from outer space._

My job, finished now, had been getting them to Disneyland. The problem
was bringing one in particular--one I had to find. The timing was
uncomfortably close.

I'd taken the last of the yellow pills yesterday, tossing the bottle away
with a sort of indifferent frustration. I won or lost on the validity
of my logic--and whether I'd built a better mousetrap.

The pills had given me 24 hours before the fatal weakness took hold;
nevertheless, I waited as long as I could. That left me less than an hour,
now; strangely, as I walked in the eerie darkness of an early
morning, virtually deserted Disneyland, I felt calm. And yet, my life
depended on the one I sought being inside the Tour building.

I was seeking a monster of terrible potential, yet so innocuous looking
that he'd not stand out. I couldn't produce him, couldn't say where
in the world he was. Nevertheless he was the basis, the motivation
second only to mine. I took the long, hard way--three years--making him
come to me.

Two years were devoted to acclimatization, learning, and then swinging
this job: just to put the idea across.

Assigned to Disneyland Public Relations in the offices at Burbank, I'd
begun with the usual low-pay, low-level jobs. I didn't, couldn't mind;
at least I had a foot in the right door. Within six months, I reached
a point where I could present the idea.

It had enough merit. My boss--35 years' experience enabled him to recognize
a good idea--took it to his boss who took it to The Boss.

Tomorrowland is the orphan division of Disneyland, thrown in as sop
to those interested more in the future than the past.

My idea was to sex up Tomorrowland: Tour the Solar System.

Not really, but we'd bill it that way. The Tour of the Solar System
Building was to be large. Its rooms would reproduce environments of parts
of the System, as best we knew them.

* * * * *
I'll never forget the first planning session when we realists
were underdogs, yet swung the basic direction. By then, the Hollywood
Mind had appeared. The Hollywood Mind is definitely a real thing, a
vicious thing, a blank thing, that paternalistically insists It knows
what the public wants.

There was general agreement on broad outlines. Trouble began over
Venus.

"Of course," said one of the Minds, "we'll easily create a swampy
environment--"
I burst out with quiet desperation: "May I comment?"
The realists were churning. Right there, sides were being chosen. I let
all know my side immediately.

"Venus is hot, but it's desert heat. Continuous dust storms with fantastic
winds--"
"People'd never go for that junk," interrupted the Mind. "Everyone
knows Venus is swampy."
"Everyone whose reading tastes matured no further than Edgar Rice
Burroughs!"
The Mind, with a if-you-know-so-much-why-aintcha-rich look, sneered,
"How come you know all about it?"
Speechless, I spread my hands. This joker was leading with his chin,
forcing the fight. I had to hit him again; if I lost, I lost
good. "A person," I said slowly and rhythmically, "with normal intelligence
and a minute interest in the universe, will keep step with the major
sciences, at least on an elementary level. I must stress the qualification
of normal intelligence."
The Mind, face contorted, was determined to get me. I was in a very
vulnerable spot; more important, so was the idea.

Mind began an emotional tirade, and mentally I damned him. It couldn't
have mattered to him what environment we used, but he was politicking
where he shouldn't.

There was silence when he stopped. This was the crux; The Boss would
decide. I held my breath.

He said, "We'll make it hot and dusty." The realists had won; the rest
climbed on the bandwagon but quick; and the temple was cleansed.

It was natural--because at the moment I was fair-haired--for the project
to become mine. God knows, I worked hard for it. I'd have to watch the
Mind, though; he would make things as difficult as possible.

However, he'd proved he was the one person I wasn't seeking. One
down and 2,499,999,999 to go.

    Within a few days, a new opposition coalition formed, headed by
    the Mind. Fortunately, they helped. I'd hesitated on one last
    point. Pushed.
    I gambled the momentum of the initial enthusiasm would carry
    it.

* * * * *
Originally the plan was a series of rooms, glassed off, that people could
stare into. There was something much better; engineering and I spent 36
hours straight, figuring costs, juggling space and equipment,
until the modification didn't look too expensive--juggling is
always possible in technical proposals.

For the results, the cost was worth it.
I hand-carried the proposal in.

Why not take people _through_ the rooms?

We could even design a simulated, usable spacesuit. There'd be airlock
doors between the rooms for effectiveness, insulation, economy. No children
under ten allowed; no adults over 50. They'd go through in groups of
10 or 11.

Sure, I realized this was the most elaborate, most ambitious concession
ever planned. The greatest ever attempted in its line, it would
cost--both us and the public. But people will pay for value. They'd
go for a buck-and-a-half or even two; the lines of those filing past the
windows, at 50 cents a crack, would also bring in the dough.

They bought it. Not all--they nixed my idea of creating exact environmental
conditions; and I didn't insist, luck and Hollywood being what they
are.

From the first, I established a special group to work on one problem.

They were dubbed the Gravity Gang, and immediately after, the GG.

I hired them for the gravity of the situation, a standard gag that,
once uttered, became as trite as the phrase.

The Tour's realism would be affected by normal weight sensations.

    The team consisted of a female set designer--who'd turn any
    male head--from the Studio, a garage mechanic with 30
    years' experience, an electronics engineer, a science fiction
    writer, and the prettiest competent secretary available.

    I found Hazel, discovering with delight she'd had three years of
anthropology at UCLA.

As soon as they assembled, I explained their job: find a way to give the
illusion of lessened gravity.

Working conditions would be the best possible--why I'd wanted the
women pretty--and their time was their own. I found the GG responded by
working 10 hours a day and thinking another 14. They were that sort.

I couldn't know the GG was foredoomed to failure by its very collective
nature; nor could I know, by its nature, the GG meant the difference
between my success and failure.

The opposition put one over; we'd started referring to the job as Tour
of the System Project. Next day, it was going the rounds as TS project.

Words, words, and men will always fight with words.

Actually, the initials were worthy of the name. The engineering problems
mounted like crazy. Words, words, and one of them got to the outside
world. Or maybe it was the additional construction crew we hired.

One logical spot for the building was next to the moon flight. The
Tour building now would be bigger than first planned, so we extended
it southeasterly. This meant changing the roadbed of the Santa Fe &
Disneyland R.R. It put me up to my ears in plane surveying--and
gave me a nasty shock.

I looked up at someone's shout, in time to see a ton of cat rolling
down the embankment at me.

* * * * *
What we were doing was easy. Using a spiral to transition gradually
from tangent to circular curve and from circular curve to tangent.
Easy?
Yeah. Sure.

If this was my baby, I'd damned well better know its personality traits.

I was out with the surveyors, I was out with the construction gang, I
was out at the wrong time.

As the yellow beast, mindless servant of man, thundered down, I
dove for the rocks.

Thank God for the rocks--we'd had to import them: the soil in Orange
County is fine for oranges, but too soft for train roadbeds.

Choking on the dust, I rolled over. The cat perched, grinning
drunkenly, on the rocks. The opposition or an accident? Surely the Mind
wasn't _that_ desperate. But I was; I had to keep the idea alive, for
myself as well as completion of the original mission.

Several million hands pulled me out; several million more patted away the
dust. Motionless, I'd just seen the driver of the cat. Seen him--and was
sorry.

He stood tall but hunched over; gaunt, with pasty skin, vapid eyes,
and a kind of yellow-nondescript hair.

It wasn't the physical characteristics, very similar to mine, that
bothered me--once after an incomplete pass, I'd been told by a young
lady that I was a "thin, sallow lecher."

I was swept by waves of impending trouble, more frightened of him than
of the opposition in toto. Then, relieved, I realized the man wasn't
the one I was expecting.

Back in my office, I wasn't allowed the luxury of nervous reaction. Our
spacesuit man wanted an Ok on design changes. Changes? What
changes?...
Oh, yes, go ahead.

A materials man wanted to know about weight.

I told him where to go--for the information.

A written progress report from the GG briefly, sardonically, said: "All
the talk about increased costs and lowered budget has decided us to ask
if any aircraft, missile, or AEC groups have come up with anti-gravity.

It'd be a lot simpler that way. Love and kisses."
I shrugged, wrote them a memo to take a week off for fishing, wenching,
or reading Van Es on the Pleistocene stratigraphy of Java.

I didn't care, as long as they returned with a fresh point of view.

Things were hectic already, less than four months after we'd started.
And we hadn't much to show, except a shift in the roadbed of the SF & D
RR. The opposition, growing stronger each day, could sit back and
rest the case, with nothing more than a smug, needling, I-told-you-so
look.

The day finally came when we broke ground for the building. It was quite
an achievement, and I invited the GG to dinner. I'd been drawn to the
bunch of screwballs--the only name possible--more and more. Maybe because
they were my brain-child, or maybe because lately they were the only
human company in which I could relax.

The Hotel is about a half-mile south of Disneyland. I arrived early,
hoping to grab a ginger ale. Our set designer, Frank--christened
Francis--caught me at the door.

"Wanted to buy you a drink. This is the first time we've met
socially."

That was true; it was equally true something bothered her. Damn it!
Trapped, I'd have to drink. We ordered, and I mulled it over.

Waited, but she said nothing.

* * * * *
The drinks came. I shook several little, bright-yellow pills from
the bottle, swallowed them, then drank.

Frank cocked her head inquisitively.

"If you must know, they're for my ulcer."
"Didn't know you had one."

"Don't, but I'll probably get one, any day."
She laughed, and I drank again. I should do my drinking alone because I
get boiled incredibly fast. It happened now. One second I was
sober; the next, drunk.

Resting a cheek on a wobbly palm-and-elbow, I said, "Has everyone
ever said you are the most beautiful--"
"Yes, but in your present state, it isn't a good idea for you to
add to that number."

I shifted to the other forearm. "Frank, things might be different if I
weren't a thin, sallow lecher."

"What a nice compliment--"
"Uh huh."
"Especially since I work for you, nominally anyway--"
"Uh huh, nominally."
"Bosses should not make passes At gals who work as lower classes."
"Uh, huh, familiar."
"But you are, and getting more so daily--"
"Uh hu--are what?" I asked in surprise.

"Thin, tired: the GG has decided you're working too hard."
"Because I don't use Vano." I grinned, having waited long to put that one
across.

"Be serious and listen--"
"_You_ listen: if I'm working too hard, it's to finish. I _must_, and
soon."
"This compulsion," she paced her words, "will kill you if you let
it."
"It'll kill me if I don't let it--"
"Here comes Harry."
It was time. Blearily, I fumbled with the pills, spilled the bottle.
Frank helped me gather them up, as Harry arrived.

He said, a look of worry on his gaunt, gray features, "The rest of us
are waiting."
Concerned, Frank asked, "Think you're able?"
"Anytime you say," I answered, in a cold-sober monotone.

She flushed, knowing I was sober, not knowing certainly if I were
serious.

* * * * *
When we were seated, I said enthusiastically, "Chateaubriand tonight,
gangsters."
The GG did not react as expected.

    Dex, the electronics engineer, said quietly, "If it's steak
    when the ground is broken, what'll it be when the thing is
    finished?"
    "A feast, for all the animals in the world--just like
    Suleiman-bin-Daoud." This, from the GG writer, Mel.
    

Their faces showed the same thing that bothered Frank.

Harry said, "We have something to do."

"Well, do it!" I tried weak joviality: "It can't be anything of earth-shaking
gravity."
Hazel, long since accepted as a GG member, replied, "It's just that
we're ... resigned."

"_What?_"
"We've produced nothing in months of sustained effort.

That's why we're resigning," Dex replied disgustedly.

Frank touched my arm, said softly, "We've examined every angle. With
the money available, it's just impossible to give a sensation of
changed weight. And we know they've been pressuring you about us being
on the payroll."

"Wait"--desperately--"if you pull out, everything will go. The opposition
needs only something like this.

Besides, the GG is the one bit of insanity I can depend on in a practical
world, the prop for my judgment--"
Harry: "Clouded judgment."
Mel: "Expensive prop."
Having grown used to their friendly insults, I sensed their resolution
weakening, felt the pendulum swinging back.

The waitress interrupted with news of an urgent phone call. It was
the worst possible time for me to leave. And the news I got threw
me.
Feeling the weight of the world, I returned.
"Can't be in two places at once," I said bitterly. "Go ahead without
me; I'm leaving."
"Wait a few minutes," Mel said, between bites of steak, "we want
to resign. Sit down."
"Damn it, I can't! I spoke to The Boss. I've pulled a boo-boo, but
big." 
"What happened?"
"Bonestell will do the backgrounds, but he has to know what rocks
we're putting in the rooms. What rocks are we? Anybody have an idea
what the surface of Mars looks like? God, how could I have missed
that?" 
"Sit down," Dex said casually, "we want to resign."
Hazel added, "You can have your rocks in 24 hours. We worked it out
weeks ago. I _did_ read Van Es, and Harry has prospected, and Dex
knows minerals, and Mel pushed his way through Tyrrell's 'Principles
of Petrology'--"
"The science of rocks," Mel interrupted, between bites of steak.
"We got interested one day." Frank's pretty, dark eyes danced.
"We want to resign," Dex repeated casually, "so sit down."
I sat.
They began throwing the ball faster than I could catch: "No atmosphere
on Mercury, then no oxidation; I insist there'd be no straight
metals.... The asteroids? Ferromagnesian blocks of some kind--any
basalts around here?... For Venus, grab a truckload of granodiorite--the
spotted stuff--from the Sierra-Nevadas and tint it pink.... Lateritic
soils for Mars? You crazy? Must have water and a subtropical
climate...."
It hit me: a valid use for the GG, one that already saved money.
Make them a brain team, trouble-shooters, or problem-solvers on
questions that could not be solved.
I said, "Fine, go ahead. About your resignations--"
Mel said something indistinguishable--I'd caught him _on_ a bite
of steak.
Hazel, belligerent, demanded: "Are you asking _us_ to resign?"

Apparently I wasn't. So they stuck, and another crisis was
met.
Unfortunately, by then, I'd forgotten the shock and warning I got
from the cat.

* * * * *
Things moved swiftly, more easily. The GG took over, becoming, in
effect, my staff. They'd become more: five different extensions of
me, each capable of acting correctly. As a team, they meshed
beautifully.
Too beautifully, at one point. Dex and Hazel were seeing eye-to-eye,
even in the dark, and I worried about the effect on the others. I
might as well have worried about the effect of a light bulb on the
sun. They married or some such, refused time off, and the GG
functioned, if anything, better. It was almost indecent the way the
five got along together.
A new problem arose: temperature. We weren't reproducing actual
temperatures, but the rooms needed a marked change, for reality's
sake.
I'd insisted on that, and having won the point, was stuck with it.
It was after 2 A.M.; I was alone in the office.
The sound of the outer door closing startled me. Footsteps approached;
I hurried to clean my desk, sweeping the bottle into the drawer.
"You're up too late. Go home." Frank had a nonarguable look in her
eye.
"You're supposed to be getting sleep."
"I am, far more than before you guys began helping, but--"
"But with all that extra sleep, you're looking worse."
"I don't _need_ any more sleep!" I said angrily, then tried diversion,
"Been on a date?"
"Yes, but I thought I'd better check on you." She moved close to
the desk, and I remembered the last time we'd been alone, in the
bar. Now I was glad I wasn't drunk.
"What the devil are you up to?" 
* * * * *
She pawed through the desk drawers. "Finding what you tried to
hide--" 
"Wait, Frank!" I yelled, too late.
She looked at the bottle, then me, with a strange expression: a
little pity--not patronizing--but mostly feminine understanding.
"Soda pop? Of course. You don't like alcohol, do you?"
"No." Gruffly.
Her eyes blinked rapidly, as though holding back tears. "I know
what's the matter with you; I _really_ know."
"There's nothing the matter with me that--"
"That beating this mess won't solve." We hadn't heard Mel enter.
He leaned casually against the door. "Terrific idea for a story."
I shrugged. "Seems to be homecoming night."
"Not quite," he glanced at his watch, "but wait another few minutes."

He was right: Harry, out of breath, was the last of the GG to
arrive.
"Now what?" I asked. "Surely this meeting isn't an accident?"
Dex said thoughtfully, "No, not really, but it is in the sense you
mean.
We didn't agree to appear tonight. Yet logically, it's time for the
temperature problem--well, I guess each of us came down to help."

What could I do? That was the GG, characteristically, so we talked
temperatures.
"What I was thinking," Harry began slowly, "was a sort of
superthermostat." Harry, as usual, came to the right starting
point.
Frank smiled, "That's right, especially considering layout. Venus
and Mercury are hot; the others, cold. What about a control console
that'll light when the rooms get outside normal temperature range?
Then the operator--"
"Hey! Why an operator?" Mel questioned. "We ought to make this
automatic." He grinned. "Giant computer ... can see it now: the
brain comes alive, tries to destroy anyone turning it off--"
I asked: "Have you been _reading_ the stuff you write?" Funny enough
for 3 A.M.
Dex said calmly, "We _can_ work this--in fact, we can tie it in
pink ribbons and forget it. An electronics outfit in Pasadena makes
an automatic scanning and logging system. Works off punched-paper
tape.
We'll code the right poop, and the system will compare it with the
actual raw data. Feedback will be to a master control servo that'll
activate the heater or cooler. Now, we need the right pickup--"
I snapped my fingers. "Variable resistor bridge. Couple of resistors
equal at the right temperature. There'll be a frequency change with
changing temperature--better than a thermocouple, I think."
They looked at me as though I were butting in.
"You've been reading, too," Dex accused. "Ok, we'll use a temperature
bulb. Trouble is, with this system, we'd better let it run
continuously.
That'll drive costs up."
Hazel asked, "Can't we use the heat, maybe to drive a compressor?
The sudden expansion of air could cool the rest. Harry?"
Harry hadn't time to answer.

"What'll this cost?" I snapped.
"Roughly, 15 to 18 thousand," Dex replied.

"_What?_"
With fine impartiality, they ignored me completely. Harry continued,
as though without interruption, "Ye-es, I guess a compressor-and-coolant
system could be arranged ...As the whole matter, then, about the
Orphan House had been commenced for the glory of God, that in this way
before the world and the church there might be another visible proof
that the Lord delights in answering prayer; and as there was yet a part
of the thousand pounds wanting; and _as I earnestly desired the book
might not leave the press_ before every shilling of that sum had been
given in answer to prayer, _without one single individual having been
asked by me for anything_, that thus I might have the sweet privilege of
bearing my testimony for God in this book;--for these reasons, I say, I
have given myself earnestly to prayer about this matter since May 21. On
May 22 came in seven pounds and ten shillings, and on May 23, three
pounds. On May 24, a lady, whom I never saw before, called on me, and
gave me forty pounds. This circumstance has greatly encouraged me; for
the Lord showed me thereby, afresh, his willingness to continue to send
us _large sums_, and that they can even come from individuals whom we
have never seen before. On May 25, three pounds and six shillings were
sent, from two unexpected quarters. On May 27 was sent, anonymously, a
parcel of worn clothes, from London, and a sovereign. To-day (May 28) I
received again four pounds three shillings and sixpence; and also a
parcel was sent from a considerable distance, containing seven pairs of
socks, and the following trinkets, to be sold for the support of the
orphans: one gold pin with an Irish pearl, fifteen Irish pearls, two
pins, two brooches, two lockets, one seal, two studs, eleven rings, one
chain, and one bracelet, all of gold.

June 15. To-day I gave myself once more earnestly to prayer respecting
the remainder of the thousand pounds. This evening five pounds were
given, so that now the whole sum is made up. During eighteen months and
ten days this petition has been brought before God almost daily. From
the moment I asked till the Lord granted it fully, I had never been
allowed to doubt that he would give every shilling of that sum. Often
have I praised him beforehand, in the assurance that he would grant my
request. The thing after which we have especially to seek in prayer is,
that we believe that we receive, according to Mark xi. 24: "_What things
soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye
shall have them._"

As the Lord has so greatly condescended to listen to my prayers, and as
I consider it one of the particular talents which he has intrusted to me
to exercise faith upon his promises, as it regards my own temporal
wants and those of others; and as an Orphan House for _boys_ above seven
years of age seems greatly needed in this city; and as also without it
we know not how to provide for the little _boys_ in the Infant Orphan
House, when they are above seven years of age, I purpose to establish an
Orphan House for about forty boys above seven years of age.

July 12. The same friend who gave me on May 24, 1837, forty pounds for
the orphans, and whom, up to that time, I had never seen, gave four
hundred and sixty pounds more, being altogether five hundred pounds.

It is now three years and four months since brother Craik and I began,
in dependence upon the Lord for funds, to seek to help the spread of the
gospel through the instrumentality of schools, the circulation of the
Holy Scriptures, and by aiding missionary exertions. Since then there
have been circulated, through our instrumentality, 4,030 copies of the
Scriptures; four day schools, for poor children, have been _established_
by us; 1,119 children have been instructed in the six day schools, and
353 children are now in those six day schools. Besides this, a Sunday
school and an adult school have been supplied with all they needed, and
missionary exertions in the East Indies, in Upper Canada, and on the
continent of Europe, have been aided. In addition to this, the word of
God has been preached from house to house among the poor, in connection
with the Scriptural Knowledge Institution, by brother C----r, within the
last two years.

    On the 15th of August, 1837, the preceding portion of this
    narrative was published.

Aug. 17. To-day two more children were received into the Infant Orphan
House, which makes up our full number, sixty-six in the Girls' and
Infant Orphan Houses.

September 2. I have been looking about for a house for the orphan boys,
these last three days. Everything else has been provided. The Lord has
given suitable individuals to take care of the children, money, etc. In
his own time he will give a house also.

September 19. It was to-day particularly impressed upon my heart that I
ought to seek for more retirement, though the work should _apparently_
suffer ever so much; and that arrangements should be made whereby I may
be able to visit the brethren more, as an _unvisited_ church will sooner
or later become an _unhealthy church_. Pastors, as fellow-laborers, are
greatly needed among us.

September 28. I have for a long time been too much outwardly engaged.
Yesterday morning I spent about three hours in the vestry of Gideon, to
be able to have more time for retirement. I meant to do the same in the
afternoon, but before I could leave the house I was called on, and thus
one person after the other came, till I had to go out. Thus it has been
again to-day.

October 16. For a long time past brother Craik and I have felt the
importance of more pastoral visiting, and it has been _one of our
greatest trials_ that we have been unable to give more time to it. Colloquy
which had great fame in the world; Gottsched himself having--such the
inaccuracy of rumor and Dutch Newspapers, on the matter--published
authentic Report of it; [Next Year, in a principal Leipzig Magazine,
with name signed: given in _Helden-Geschichte,_ iv.
728-739 (with multifarious commentaries and flourishings, denoting
an attentive world).

Nicolai, _Anekdoten,_ iii. 286-290.] now one of the dullest bits of
reading, and worth no man's bit of time. Colloquy which lasted three
hours, with the greatest vivacity on both sides; King impugning, for one
principal thing, the roughness of German speech; Gottsched, in swift
torrents (far too copious in such company), ready to defend. 'Those
consonants of ours,' said the King, 'they afflict one's ear: what Names
we have; all in mere K's and P's: KNAP-, KNIP-, KLOP-, KROTZ-, KROK--;--your
own Name, for example!'"

--Yes, his own Name, unmusical GottSCHED, and signifying God's-Damage
(God's-SKAITH) withal.
"Husht, don't take a Holy Name in vain; call the man SCHED ('Damage'
by itself), can't we!" said a wit once. [Nicolai, _Anekdoten,_ iii.
287.]--"'Five consonants together, TTSCH, TTSCH, what a tone!' continued
the King. 'Hear, in contrast, the music of this Stanza of Rousseau's
[Repeats a stanza]. Who could express that in German with such melody?'
And so on; branching through a great many provinces; King's knowledge
of all Literature, new and ancient, 'perfectly astonishing to me;' and I
myself, the swift-speaking Gottsched, rather copious than otherwise.
Catastrophe, and summary of the whole, was: Gottsched undertook to
translate the Rousseau Stanza into German of moderate softness; and
by the aid of water did so, that very night; [Copied duly in
_Helden-Geschichte,_ iv. 726.] sent it next day, and had 'within an hour'
a gracious Royal Answer in verse; calling one, incidentally, 'Saxon
Swan, CYGNE SAXON,' though one is such a Goose! 'Majesty to march at 7
to-morrow morning,' said a Postscript,--no Interviewing more, at
present.

"About ten days after [not to let this thing interrupt us again],
Friedrich, on his return to Leipzig, had another Interview with
Gottsched; of only one hour, this time;--but with many topics: Reading
of some Gottsched Ode (ODE, very tedious, frothy, watery, of THANKS to
Majesty for such goodness to the Saxon Swan; reading, too, of 'some of
Madam Gottsched's Pieces'). Majesty confessed afterwards, Every hour
from the very first had lowered his opinion of the Saxon Swan, till at
length Goosehood became too apparent. Friedrich sent him a gold
snuffbox by and by, but had no farther dialoguing.

"A saying of Excellency Mitchell's to Gottsched--for Gottsched, on that
second Leipzig opportunity, went swashing about among the King's Suite
as well--is still remembered. They were talking of Shakspeare: 'Genial,
if you will,' said Gottsched, 'but the Laws of Aristotle; Five
Acts, unities strict!'

--'Aristotle? What is to hinder a man from making his Tragedy in Ten acts,
if it suit him better?' 'Impossible, your Excellency!'--'Pooh,' said his
Excellency; 'suppose Aristotle, and general Fashion too, had ordered
that the clothes of every man were to be cut from five ells of cloth:
how would the Herr Professor like [with these huge limbs of his] if
he found there were no breeches for him, on Aristotle's account?' Adieu
to Gottsched; most voluminous of men;--who wrote a Grammar of the
German Language, which, they say, did good.
I remember always his poor Wife with some pathos; who was a fine, graceful,
loyal creature, of ten times his intelligence; and did no end of writing
and translating and compiling (Addison's CATO, Addison's SPECTATOR,
thousands of things from all languages), on order of her Gottsched,
till life itself sank in such enterprises; never doubting, tragically
faithful soul, but her Gottsched was an authentic Seneschal of Phoebus
and the Nine." [Her LETTERS, collected by a surviving Lady-Friend, "BRIEFE
DER FRAU LUISE ADELGUNDE VIKTORIE GOTTSCHED, born KULMUS (Dresden,
1771-1772, 3 vols. 8vo)," are, I should suppose, the only Gottsched
Piece which anybody would now think of reading.]--
Monday, 17th, at seven, his Majesty pushed off accordingly; cheery he
in the prospect of work, whatever his friends in the distance be. Here,
from Eilenburg, his first stage Torgau-way, are a Pair of Letters
in notable contrast.

WILHELMINA TO THE KING (on rumor of Haddick, swoln into a Triple Invasion,
Austrian, Swedish, French).

    
    BAIREUTH, "15th October, 1757.
    

"MY DEAREST BROTHER,--Death and a thousand torments could not equal
the frightful state I am in.

There run reports that make me shudder. Some say you are wounded;
others, dangerously ill. In vain have I tormented myself to have news of
you; I can get none. Oh, my dear Brother, come what may, I will
not survive you.

If I am to continue in this frightful uncertainty, I cannot stand it; I
shall sink under it, and then I shall be happy. I have been on the point
of sending you a courier; but [environed as we are] I durst not. In
the name of God, bid somebody write me one word.

"I know not what I have written; my heart is torn in pieces; I feel
that by dint of disquietude and alarms I am losing my wits.

Oh, my dear, adorable Brother, have pity on me.

Heaven grant I be mistaken, and that you may scold me; but the least
thing that concerns you pierces me to the heart, and alarms my
affection too much.

Might I die a thousand times, provided you lived and were happy!

"I can say no more.

    Grief chokes me; and I can only repeat that your fate shall
    be mine; being, my dear Brother, your

"WILHELMINA."
What a shrill penetrating tone, like the wildly weeping voice of Rachel;
tragical, painful, gone quite to falsetto and above pitch; but with a
melody in its dissonance like the singing of the stars. My poor shrill
Wilhelmina!--

KING TO WILHELMINA (has not yet received the Above).

"EILENBURG, 17th October, 1757.

"MY DEAREST SISTER,--What is the good of philosophy unless one employ
it in the disagreeable moments of life?

It is then, my dear Sister, that courage and firmness avail us.

"I am now in motion; and having once got into that, you may calculate I
shall not think of sitting down again, except under improved omens.
If outrage irritates even cowards, what will it do to hearts that have
courage?

"I foresee I shall not be able to write again for perhaps six weeks:
which fails not to be a sorrow to me: but I entreat you to be calm during
these turbulent affairs, and to wait with patience the month of
December; paying no regard to the Nurnberg Newspapers nor to those of the
Reich, which are totally Austrian.

"I am tired as a dog (COMME UN CHIEN). I embrace you with my whole heart;
being with the most perfect affection (TENDRESSE), my dearest Sister,
your"-- FRIEDRICH.

... (AT SOME OTHER HOUR, SAME PLACE AND DAY.) "'No possibility of Peace,'
say your accounts [Letter lost]; 'the French won't hear my name mentioned.'
Well; from me they shall not farther. The way will be, to speak to them
by action, so that they may repent their impertinences and pride." [_OEuvres
de Frederic,_ xxvii. i. 308, 309, 310.]'
The Haddick affair, after all the rumor about it, proved to be a
very small matter.

No Swede or Richelieu had dreamt of co-operating; Haddick, in the
end, was scarce 4,000 with four cannon; General Rochow, Commandant
of Berlin, with his small garrison, had not Haddick skilfully slidden
through woods, and been so magnified by rumor, might have marched
out, and beaten a couple of Haddicks.

As it was, Haddick skilfully emerging, at the Silesian Gate of Berlin,
16th October, about eleven in the morning, demanded ransom of 300,000
thalers (45,000 pounds); was refused; began shooting on the poor
palisades, on the poor drawbridge there; "at the third shot brought
down the drawbridge;" rushed into the suburb; and was not to be
pushed out again by the weak party Rochow sent to try it.

Rochow, ignorant of Haddick's force, marched off thereupon for
Spandau with the Royal Family and effects; leaving Haddick master
of the suburb, and Berlin to make its own bargain with him. Haddick, his
Croats not to be quite kept from mischief, remained master of the
suburb, minatory upon Berlin, for twelve hours or more: and after
a good deal of bargaining,--ransom of 45,000 pounds, of 90,000
pounds, finally of 27,000 pounds and "two dozen pair of gloves to
the Empress Queen,"--made off about five in the morning; wind of
Moritz's advance adding wings to the speed of Haddick.

[_Helden-Geschichte,_ iv. 715-723 (Haddick's own Account, and the Berlin
one).]

Moritz did arrive next evening (18th); but with his tired troops there
was no catching of Haddick, now three marches ahead.

Royal Family and effects returned from Spandau the day following;
but in a day or two more, removed to Magdeburg till the Capital were
safe from such affronts. Much grumbling against Rochow. "What could I do?
How could I know?" answered Rochow, whose eyesight indeed had been
none of the best.

Berlin smarts to the length of 27,000 pounds and an alarm; but asserts
(not quite mythically, thinks Retzow), that "the two dozen pair
of gloves were all gloves for the left hand,"--Berlin having wit,
and a touch of ABSINTHE in it, capable of such things!

Friedrich heard the news at Annaburg, a march beyond Torgau; and there
paused, again uncertain, for about a week coming; after which, he
discovered that Leipzig would be the place; and returned thither,
appointing a general rendezvous and concentration there.

SCENE AT REGENSBURG IN THE INTERIM.

Just while Haddick was sliding swiftly through the woods, Berlin now
nigh, there occurred a thing at Regensburg; tragic thing, but ending in
farce,--Finale of REICHS-ACHT, in short;--about which all Regensburg was
loud, wailing or haha-ing according to humor; while Berlin was paying its
ransom and left-hand gloves. One moment's pause upon this, though
our haste is great.

"Reichs Diet had got its Ban of the Reich ready for Friedrich; CITATIO
(solemn Summons) and all else complete; nothing now wanted but to serve
Citatio on him, or 'insinuate' it into him, as their phrase is;--which
latter essential point occasions some shaking of wigs. Dangerous,
serving Citatio in that quarter: and by what art try to smuggle it into
the hands of such a one? 'Insinuate it here into his, Plotho's, hand;
that is the method, and that will suffice!' say the wigs, and choose
an unfortunate Reichs Notary, Dr. Aprill, to do it; who, in ponderous
Chancery-style, gives the following affecting report,--wonderful, but
intelligible (when abridged):--
"Citatio" to come and receive your Ban,--a very solemn-sounding Document,
commencing (or perhaps it is Aprill himself that so commences, no matter
which), "'In the Name of the Most High God, the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost, Amen,'--was given, Wednesday, 12th October, in the Year after
Christ our dear Lord and Saviour's Birth, 1757 Years, To me Georgius
Mathias Josephus Aprill, sworn Kaiserlich Notarius Publicus; In my Lodging,
first-floor fronting south, in Jacob Virnrohr the Innkeeper's House
here at Regensburg, called the Red-Star," for insinuation into
Plotho:
With which solemn Piece, Aprill proceeded next day, Thursday,
half-past 2 P.M., to Plotho's dwelling-place, described with equal
irrefragability; and, continues Aprill, "did there, by a servant
of the Herr Ambassador von Plotho's, announce myself; adding that
I had something to say to his Excellency, if he would please to
admit me.

    To which the Herr Ambassador by the same servant sent answer, that
    he was ill with a cold, and that I might speak to his Secretarius
what I had to say.

But, as I replied that my message was to his Excellenz in person, the same
servant came back with intimation that I might call again to-morrow at
noon."
To-morrow, at the stroke of noon, Friday, 14th October, Aprill
punctually appears again, with recapitulation of the pledge given
him yesterday; and is informed that he can walk up-stairs.

"I proceeded thereupon, the servant going before, up one pair of stairs,
or with the appurtenances (GEZEUGEN) rather more than one pair, into
the Herr Ambassador Freiherr von Plotho's Anteroom; who, just as we were
entering, stept in himself, through a side-door; in his
dressing-gown, and with the words, 'Speak now what you have to say.'

"I thereupon slipt into his hand CITATIO FISCALIS, and said"--said at
first nothing, Plotho avers; merely mumbled, looked like some poor
caitiff, come with Law-papers on a trifling Suit we happen to have in
the Courts here;--and only by degrees said (let us abridge; SCENE,
Aprill and Plotho, Anteroom in Regensburg, first-floor and rather
higher):--
APRILL. "'I have to give your Excellenz this Writing,--[which privately,
could your Excellenz guess it, is] CITATIO FISCALIS from the Reichstag,
summoning his Majesty to show cause why Ban of the Reich should
not pass upon him!'

His Excellenz at first took the CITATIO and adjuncts from me; and looking
into them to see what they were, his Excellenz's face began to color,
and soon after to color a little more; and on his looking attentively
at CITATIO FISCALIS, he broke into violent anger and rage, so that
he could not stand still any longer; but with burning face, and both
arms held aloft, rushed close to me, CITATIO and adjuncts in his right
hand, and broke out in this form:--
PLOTHO. "'What; insinuate (INSINUIEREN), you scoundrel!'
APRILL. "'It is my Notarial Office; I must do it.'

In spite of which the Freiherr von Plotho fell on me with all rage; grasped
me by the front of the cloak, and said:--
PLOTHO. "'Take it back, wilt thou!' And as I resisted doing so, he
stuck it in upon me, and shoved it down with all violence between my
coat and waistcoat; and, still holding me by the cloak, called to the
two servants who had been there, 'Fling him down stairs!'--which they,
being discreet fellows, and in no flurry, did not quite, nor needed
quite to do ('Must, sir, you see, unless!'), and so forced me out of the
house; Excellenz Plotho retiring through his Anteroom, and his Body-servant,
who at first had been on the stairs, likewise disappearing as I got under
way,"--and have to report, in such manner, to the Universe and Reichs
Diet, with tears in my eyes. [Preuss, ii. 397-401; in _Helden-Geschichte,
_ iv. 745-749, Plotho's Account.]

What became of Reichs Ban after this, ask not. It fell dead by Friedrich's
victories now at hand; rose again into life on Friedrich's misfortunes
(August, 1758), threatening to include George Second in it; upon which
the CORPUS EVANGELICORUM made some counter-mumblement;--and, I have heard,
the French privately advised: "Better drop it; these two Kings are
capable of walking out of you, and dangerously kicking the table over
as they go!"--Whereby it again fell dead, positively for the last time,
and, in short, is worth no mention or remembrance more.

CORPUS EVANGELICORUM had always been against Reichs Ban: a few Dissentients,
or Half-Dissentients excepted,--as Mecklenburg wholly and with a will;
foolish Anspach wholly; and the Anhalts haggling some dissent, and
retracting it (why, I never knew);--for which Mecklenburg and the
Anhalts, lying within clutch of one, had to repent bitterly in the
years coming!

Enough of all that.

The Haddick invasion, which had got its gloves, left-hand or not, and part
of its road-expenses, brought another consequence much more important on
the PER-CONTRA side.

The triumphing, TE-DEUM-ing and jubilation over it,--"His Metropolis
captured; Royal Family in flight!"--raised the Dauphiness Army, and
especially Versailles, into such enthusiasm, that Dauphiness came bodily
out (on order from Versailles); spread over the Country, plundering
and insulting beyond example; got herself reinforced by a 15,000 from
the Richelieu Army; crossed the Saale; determined on taking Leipzig,
beating Friedrich, and I know not what. Keith, in Leipzig with a small
Party, had summons from Soubise's vanguard (October 24th): Keith
answered, He would burn the suburbs;--upon which, said vanguard,
hearing of Friedrich's advent withal, took itself rapidly away.

And Soubise and it would fain have recrossed Saale, I have understood,
had not Versailles been peremptory.

In a word, Friedrioh arrived at Leipzig October 26th; Ferdinand, Moritz
and all the others coming or already come: and there is something great
just at hand. Friedrich's stay in Leipzig was only four days. Cheering
prospect of work now ahead here;--add to this, assurance from Preussen
that Apraxin is fairly going home, and Lehwald coming to look after the
Swedes. Were it not that there is bad news from Silesia, things generally
are beginning to look up. Of the hour spent on Gottsched, in these four
days, we expressly take no notice farther; but there was another visit
much less conspicuous, and infinitely more important: that of a certain
Hanoverian Graf von Schulenburg, not in red or with plumes, like a
Major-General as he was, but "in the black suit of a Country Parson,"--coming,
in that unnoticeable guise, to inform Friedrich officially, "That the
Hanoverians and Majesty of England have resolved to renounce the
Convention of Kloster-Zeven; to bring their poor Stade Army into the field
again; and do now request him, King Friedrich, to grant them Duke
Ferdinand of Brunswick to be General of the same." [Mauvillon, i.
256; Westphalen, i. 315: indistinct both, and with slight variations.
Mitchell Papers (in British Museum), likewise indistinct:
Additional MSS. 6815, pp. 96 and 108 ("Lord Holderness to Mitchell,"
doubtless on Pitt's instigation, "10th October, 1757," is the
beginning of it,--two days before Royal Highness got home from Stade);
see ib.
6806, pp. 241-252.]

Here is an unnoticeable message, of very high moment indeed. To which
Friedrich, already prepared, gives his cheerful consent; nominations
and practicalities to follow, the instant these present hurries are
over.
Who it was that had prepared all this, whose suggestion it first was,
Friedrich's, Mitchell's, George's, Pitt's, I do not know,--I cannot help
suspecting Pitt; Pitt and Friedrich together. And certainly of all
living men, Ferdinand--related to the English and Prussian royalties,
a soldier of approved excellence, and likewise a noble-minded,
prudent, patient and invincibly valiant and steadfast man--was,
beyond comparison, the fittest for this office.

  Pitt is now fairly in power; and perceives,--such Pitt's
  originality of view,--that an Army with a Captain to it may differ
beautifully from one without.

And in fact we may take this as the first twitch at the reins, on Pitt's
part; whose delicate strong hand, all England running to it with one
heart, will be felt at the ends of the earth before many months go. To
the great and unexpected joy of Friedrich, for one. "England has taken
long to produce a great man," he said to Mitchell; "but here is
one at last!"

BOOK XVIII (CONTINUED)--SEVEN-YEARS WAR RISES TO A HEIGHT. 1757-1759.

Chapter VIII.

--BATTLE OF ROSSBACH.

Friedrich left Leipzig Sunday, October 30th; encamped, that night, on
the famous Field of Lutzen, with the vanguard, he (as usual, and Mayer
with him, who did some brisk smiting home of what French there
were); Keith and Duke Ferdinand following, with main body and rear.

That God is the "Father of the fatherless," and that he, therefore,
as their father, would be pleased to provide. Psalm lxviii. 5.

3. That I have received the children in the name of Jesus, and that
therefore he, in these children, has been received, and is fed, and is
clothed; and that therefore he would be pleased to consider this. Mark
ix. 36, 37.

4. That the faith of many of the children of God has been strengthened
by this work hitherto, and that, if God were to withhold the means for
the future, those who are weak in faith would be staggered; whilst, by a
continuance of means, their faith might still further be strengthened.

5. That many enemies would laugh, were the Lord to withhold supplies,
and say, Did we not foretell that this enthusiasm would come to nothing?

6. That many of the children of God, who are uninstructed, or in a
carnal state, would feel themselves _justified_ to continue their
alliance with the world in the work of God, and to go on as heretofore
in their unscriptural proceedings respecting similar institutions, so
far as the obtaining of means is concerned, if he were not to help me.

7. That the Lord would remember that I am his child, and that he would
graciously pity me, and remember that _I_ cannot provide for these
children, and that therefore he would not allow this burden to lie upon
me long without sending help.

8. That he would remember likewise my fellow-laborers in the work, who
trust in him, but who would be tried were he to withhold supplies.

9. That he would remember that I should have to dismiss the children
from under our scriptural instruction to their former companions.

10. That he would show that those were mistaken who said, that, _at the
first_, supplies might be expected, while the thing was new, but not
afterwards.

11. Labor and the laborer had gained little.

The weapon-show, depicted in _Old Mortality_, and the market-fair, as
vivid in the _Vicar of Wakefield_, exemplify the expositions of
those days.

To them were added a variety of church festivals, or "functions," still
a great feature of the life of Catholic countries.
Trade and frolic divided these among themselves in infinite gradation
of respective share, now the ell-wand, and now the quarter-staff
or the fiddler's bow, representing the sceptre of the Lord of
Misrule.

"At Christe's Kirk on the Grene that day" the Donnybrook element would
appear to have predominated. The mercantile feature was naturally preferred
by gentle Goldy, and the hapless investor in green spectacles may
be counted the first dissatisfied exhibitor on record at a modern
exposition, for he skirts the century.

Looking eastward, we find these rallies of the people, the time-honored
stalking-grounds of tale-writers and students of character generally,
swell into more imposing proportions. The sea dwindles and the land
broadens. Transportation and travel become difficult and hazardous.
Merchant and customer, running alike a labyrinthine gauntlet of taxes,
tolls and arbitrary exactions by the wolves of schloss and château,
found it safest to make fewer trips and concentrate their transactions.
The great nations, with many secondary trade-tournaments, as they
may be termed, had each a principal one.
From the great fair of Leipsic, with the intellectual but very bulky
commodity of books for its specialty to-day, we pass to the two
Novgorods--one of them no more than a tradition, having been annihilated
by Peter the Great when, with the instinct of great rulers for deep
water, he located the new capital of his vast interior empire on
the only available harbor it possessed. Its successor, known from its
numerous namesakes by the designation of "New," draws convoys of
merchandise from a vast tributary belt bounded by the Arctic and North
Pacific oceans and the deserts of Khiva. This traffic exceeds a hundred
millions of dollars annually. The medley of tongues and products due
to the united contributions of Northern Siberia, China and Turkestan
is hardly to be paralleled elsewhere on the globe.
_Was_, insists the all-conquering railway as it moves inexorably eastward,
and relegates the New Novgorod, with its modern fairs, to the
stranded condition of the old one, with its traditional expositions.

As, however, the rail must have a terminus somewhere, if only temporary,
the caravans of camels, oxen, horses, boats and sledges will
converge to a movable entrepôt that will assume more and more an
inter-Asiatic instead of an inter-national character.

The furs, fossil ivory, sheepskins and brick tea brought by them after
voyages often reaching a year and eighteen months, come, strictly enough,
under the head of raw products. Still, it is the best they can bring;
which cannot be said of what Europe offers in exchange--articles mostly
of the class and quality succinctly described as "Brummagem." It is obvious
that prizes, diplomas, medals, commissioners and juries would be
thrown away here.

The palace of glass and iron can only loom in the distant future, like the
cloud-castle in Cole's _Voyage of Life_. It may possibly be essayed in
a generation or two, when Ekaterinenborg, built up into a great city by
the copper, iron, gold, and, above all, the lately-opened coal-mines
of the Ural, shall have become the focus of the Yenisei, Amour, Yang-tse
and Indus system of railways.

But here, again, we are overstepping our century.

[Illustration: INTERIOR VIEW OF THE TRANSEPT OF CRYSTAL PALACE.]
To us it seems odd that in the days when an autocratic decree could
summarily call up "all the world" to be taxed, and when, in prompt
obedience to it, the people of all the regions gathered to a thousand
cities, the idea of numbering and comparing, side by side, goods,
handicrafts, arts, skill, faculties and energies, as well as heads,
never occurred to rulers or their counselors. If it did, it was
never put in practice.

The difficulties to which we have before adverted stood in the way of
that combination of individual effort to which the great displays
of our day are mainly indebted for their success; but what the government
might have accomplished toward overcoming distance and defective means
of transport is evidenced by the mighty current of objects of art,
luxury and curiosity which flowed toward the metropolis. Obelisks, colossal
statues, and elephants and giraffes by the score are articles of traffic
not particularly easy to handle even now.

[Illustration: NEW YORK EXHIBITION BUILDING, 1853.]
At the annual exposition of the Olympic games we have the feature of a
distribution of prizes. They were conferred, however, only on horses,
poets and athletes--a conjunction certainly in advance of the asses
and savants that constituted the especial care of the French army in
Egypt, but not up to the modern idea of the comprehensiveness of human
effort. While our artists confess it almost a vain hope to rival the
cameo brooch that fastened the scanty garment of the Argive charioteer,
or the statue spattered with the foam of his horses and shrouded
in the dust of his furious wheel--while they are content to be
teachable, moreover, by the exquisite embroidery and lacework in
gold and cotton thread displayed at another semi-religious and
similarly ancient reunion at Benares,--they claim the alliance and
support of many classes of craftsmen unrepresented on the Ganges
or Ilissus.

These were, in the old days, ranked with slaves, many of whom were merchants
and tradesmen; and they labor yet in some countries under the social ban
of courts, no British merchant or cotton-lord, though the master of
millions, being presentable at Buckingham Palace, itself the product of
the counting-room and the loom. Little, however, does this slight
appear to affect the sensibilities of the noble army of producers, who
loyally rejoice to elevate their constitutional sovereign on their
implements as the Frankish prolétaries did upon their shields.

The family of expositions with which we are directly concerned is, like
others of plebeian origin, at some loss as to the roots of its ancestral
tree. We may venture to locate them in the middle of the eighteenth
century. In 1756-57 the London Society of Arts offered prizes for
specimens of decorative manufactures, such as tapestry, carpets and
porcelain.

This was part of the same movement with that which brought into
being the Royal Academy, with infinitely less success in the promotion
of high art than has attended the development of taste, ingenuity
and economy in the wider if less pretentious field.

France's first exhibition of industry took place in 1798.

It was followed by others under the Consulate and Empire in 1801,
1802, 1806.

    In 1819 the French expositions became regular. Each year
    attested an advance, and drew more and more the attention of
    adjacent countries.

The international idea had not yet suggested itself. The tendency was
rather to the less than the more comprehensive, geographically speaking.
Cities took the cue from the central power, and got up each its own
show, of course inviting outside competition.

The nearest resemblance to the grand displays of the past quarter of
a century was perhaps that of Birmingham in 1849, which had yet no
government recognition; but the French exposition of five years earlier
had a leading influence in bringing on the London Fair of 1851, which
had its inception as early as 1848--one year before the Birmingham
display.

The getting up of a World's Fair was an afterthought; the original
design having been simply an illustration of British industrial
advancement, in friendly rivalry with that which was becoming, across
the Channel, too brilliant to be ignored. The government's contribution,
in the first instance, was meagre enough--merely the use of a site.
Rough discipline in youth is England's system with all her bantlings.
She is but a frosty parent if at bottom kindly, and, when she has
a shadow of justification, proud.

In the present instance she stands excused by the sore shock caused her
conservatism by the conceit of a building of glass and iron four times
as long as St.
Paul's, high enough to accommodate comfortably one of her ancestral
elms, and capacious enough to sustain a general invitation to all mankind
to exhibit and admire.

Novelty and innovation attended the first step of the great movement.
The design of the structure made architects rub their eyes, and yet its
origin was humble and practical enough. The Adam of crystal palaces,
like him of Eden, was a gardener. When Joseph Paxton raised the
palm-house at Chatsworth he little suspected that he was building for
the world--that, to borrow a simile from his own vocation, he was
setting a bulb which would expand into a shape of as wide note as the
domes of Florence and St. Sophia. And the cost of his new production
was so absurdly low--eighty thousand pounds by the contract.
The cheapness of his plan was its great merit in the eyes of the
committee, and that which chiefly determined its selection over two
hundred and forty-four competitors. This new cathedral for the apotheosis
of industry resembled those of the old worship in the attributes of nave,
aisles and transepts; and these features have been, by reason in
great degree of the requirements of construction, continued in its
successors. Galleries were added to the original design to secure space
additional to what was naturally deemed at first an ample allowance
for all comers.

Before ground had been well broken the demands of British exhibitors
alone ran up to four hundred and seventeen thousand superficial feet
instead of the two hundred and ten thousand--half the whole area--allotted
them. The United States were offered forty thousand feet; France, fifty
thousand, afterward increased to sixty-five; the Zollverein, thirty
thousand, and India the same. A comparison of the whole number of
exhibitors, as distributed between Great Britain and other
countries, indicates that the equal division of the superficial space
was a tolerably accurate guess. They numbered 7381 from the mother-country
and her colonies, and 6556 from the rest of the world. Certainly, a
change this from the first French exhibition, held in the dark days of
the Directory, when the list reached but 110 names. We shall dismiss
the statistics of this exhibition with the remark that it has precedence
of its fellows in financial success as well as in time, having cleared
a hundred and seventy-odd thousand pounds, and left the Kensington
Museum as a memorial of that creditable feat, besides sending its
cast-off but still serviceable induviæ to Sydenham, where it enshrines
another museum, chiefly of architectural reproductions in plaster,
in a sempiternal coruscation of fountains, fireworks and fiddle-bows.

The palace of industry has become the palace of the industrial--abundantly
useful still if it lure him from the palace of gin. The chrism of
Thackeray's inaugural ode will not have been dishonored.

[Illustration: CORK EXHIBITION BUILDING, 1853.]
The first of the great fairs, in so many respects a model to all that
came after, was beset at the outset by the same difficulty in arrangement
encountered by them. How to reconcile the two headings of subjects
and nations, groups of objects and groups of exhibitors, the endowments
and progress of different races and the advance of mankind generally
in the various fields of effort, was, and is, a problem only approximately
to be solved. It was yet more complicated in 1851 from the compression
of the entire display into one building of simple and symmetrical form,
instead of dispersing certain classes of objects, bulky and requiring
special appliances for their proper display, into subsidiary
structures--the plan so effectively employed in Fairmount Park.

A sort of compromise was arrived at which rendered possible the mapping
of both countries and subjects, especially in the reports, and to some
extent in the exhibition itself, without making the spectacle one of
confusion. The visitor was enabled to accomplish his double voyage
through the depths of the sea of glass without a great deal of backing
and filling, and to find his log, after it was over, reasonably
coherent.

The articles displayed were ranged under thirty heads. The preponderance
of matter of fact was shown in the concession of four of these to
raw material, nineteen to manufactures, and _one_ to the fine arts.

Twenty-nine atoms of earth to one of heaven! Of course the one-thirtieth
whereinto the multiform and elastic shape of genius was invited, like
the afreet into his chest, to condense itself, had to be subdivided--an
intaglio and a temple, a scarabæus and a French battle-picture,
being very different things. This was accomplished, and the Muses
made as comfortable as could be expected. They soon asserted the pre-eminence
theirs by right divine, and came to be the leading attraction of the
affair, next to the Koh-i-noor. On this barbaric contribution of the
gorgeous East the French observers, a little jealous perhaps, were severe.
One of them says: "They rely on the sun to make it sparkle," and, when
the fog is too thick, on gas.
The curiosity about it, in the eyes of this incisive Gaul, was "not the
divinity, but the worshipers." All day long a crowd filed solemnly
by it under the supervision of a detachment of police, each pilgrim
bestowing upon the fetish, "an egg-shaped lump of glass," half a
second's adoration, and then moving reluctantly on. Thousands of far
more beautiful things were around it, but none embodying in so
small a space so many dollars and cents, and none therefore so
brilliant in the light of the nineteenth century.

As this light, nevertheless, is that in which we live, move and have our
being, we must accept it, and turn to substantials, wrought and
unwrought.

On our way to this feast of solids we must step for a moment into St.
Paul's and listen to the great commemorative concert of sixty-five hundred
voices that swept all cavilers, foreign and domestic, off their feet,
brought tears to the most sternly critical eye, and caused the
composer, Cramer, to exclaim, as he looked up into the great dome,
filled with the volume of harmony, "Cosa stupenda! stupenda! La
gloria d'Inghilterra!"
A transition, indeed, from this to coal and iron--from a concord of
sweet sounds to the rumble into hold, car and cart of thirty-five millions
of tons of coal and two and a half millions of iron, the yearly product
at that time of England! She has since doubled that of iron, and
nearly trebled her extract of coal, whatever her progress in the
harvest of good music and good pictures. Forced by economical
necessity and assisted by chemistry, she makes her fuel, too, go a
great deal farther than it did in 1851, when the estimate was
that eighty-one per cent. of that consumed in iron-smelting was
lost, and when the "duty" of a bushel of coal burnt in a steam-engine
was less than half what it now is.

The United States have the benefit of these improvements, at the same
time that their yield of coal has swelled from four millions of tons at
that time to more than fifty now, and of iron in a large though not
equal ratio. The Lake Superior region, which rested its claims on a
sample of its then annual product of one hundred tons of copper, now
exports seven hundred thousand tons of iron ore.

Steel, now replacing iron in some of its heaviest uses, appeared as
almost an article of luxury in the shape of knives, scissors and
the like.

The success of the Hindus in its production was quite envied and admired,
though they had probably advanced little since Porus deemed thirty pounds
a present fit for Alexander; their rude appliances beating Sheffield
an hour and a half in the four hours demanded by the most adroit
forgers of the city of whittles for its elimination from the warm
bath of iron and carbon.

An orphan from Devonshire arrived last evening. With her was sent
two pounds five shillings and sixpence. The sister who brought her gave
also a silver tea-pot, sugar-basin, and cream-jug, of the weight of
forty-eight ounces, having found true riches in Christ. There was also
in the boxes nine shillings. One of the laborers paid for a ton of
coals. We obtained sixteen pounds sixteen shillings for the silver
articles. Thus we were helped through the heavy expenses of the
following days.

Oct. 12. To-day seven brethren and sisters were added to us in
fellowship, and eight were proposed. May the Lord send helpers for the
work!

Oct. 15. I knew that there would be money needed this morning for many
things in the Orphan Houses, and my heart was therefore lifted up to the
Lord. Just when I was going to meet my fellow-laborers for prayer, I
received from Trowbridge four pounds. There had come in also at the
Orphan Houses seven shillings and threepence. To this one of the
laborers added one pound. Thus I was enabled abundantly to supply all
that was wanted, and to pay for a cask of treacle and a ton of coals. We
are now, however, cast again on the love of our Lord for further
supplies, as there is neither anything in hand, nor have the laborers
any more of their own to give.

Oct. 16. I was looking up to the Lord for help early this morning, when,
almost immediately afterwards, brother T. came, and brought two silver
tablespoons and six teaspoons, which had been left anonymously,
yesterday afternoon, at the Girls' Orphan House. This afternoon I
received twelve pounds from Staffordshire.

Oct. 22. To-day our funds were again quite low. In the Infant Orphan
House only twopence was left, and very little in the other two houses.
But the Lord most manifestly again answered prayer, by sending four
pounds three shillings and one penny.

Oct. 27. Thanks to our adorable Lord! this day also we have not been
confounded; for there was six shillings in the box at the Infant Orphan
House, and six shillings came in for things which had been given to be
sold. To this one of the laborers added eighteen shillings. By means of
this one pound ten shillings we have been able to meet all pressing
demands, and to procure provisions for to-day and to-morrow.

Oct. 29. Monday. The Lord has again given us this day our daily bread,
though in the morning there was not the least natural prospect of
obtaining supplies.

Oct. 30. This has been again a day of peculiar mercies in reference to
the funds. Whilst I was in prayer respecting them a brother brought two
and a quarter yards of cloth. He had bought it for himself; but
afterwards, considering that he had sufficient clothes, he gave it to be
sold for the orphans. This evening a sister gave me twenty pounds, ten
of which were for the Orphans, and ten for the other objects.

Nov. 7. The funds are now again completely exhausted.

Nevertheless, there was a good dinner, and by managing so as to help one
another with bread, etc., there was a prospect of getting over this day
also; but for none of the houses had we the prospect of being able to
take in bread. When I left the brethren and sisters at one o'clock,
after prayer, I told them that we must wait for help, and see how the
Lord would deliver us at this time. I was sure of help, but we were
indeed straitened. When I came to Kingsdown, I felt that I needed more
exercise, being very cold, wherefore I went not the nearest way home,
but round by Clarence-place. About twenty yards from my house I met a
brother, who walked back with me, and after a little conversation gave
me ten pounds to be handed over to the brethren, the deacons, towards
providing the poor saints with coals, blankets, and warm clothing; also
five pounds for the orphans, and five pounds for the other objects of

Friedrich's march to Landshut is, again, much admired. Daun the had beset
the three great roads, the two likeliest especially, with abundant
Pandours, a very eventful absence. In Grussau he stayed whole days;--busy

When brother T. called
upon me, between twelve and one o'clock, for money, I had none to give.
In the afternoon at four I was able to meet with the brethren and
sisters. When I came to the Girls' Orphan House, I found that one of
those children, for the reception of whom we had given notice, had been
brought from Bath, and with him was sent one pound five shillings. After
the meeting was over one of the laborers gave ten shillings. By means of
this one pound fifteen shillings we were able for this day also to
provide everything needful.

August 22. In my morning walk, when I was reminding the Lord of our
need, I felt assured that he would send help this day. My assurance
sprang from our need; for there seemed no way to get through the day
without help being sent. After breakfast I considered whether there was
anything which might be turned into money for the dear children. Among
other things there came under my hands a number of religious pamphlets
which had been given for the benefit of the orphans; but all seemed not
nearly enough to meet the necessities of the day. In this our deep
poverty, after I had gathered together the few things for sale, a
sister, _who earns her bread by the labor of her hands_, brought
eighty-two pounds. This sister had seen it to be binding upon believers
in our Lord Jesus to act out his commandments: "Sell that ye have (sell
your possessions) and give alms," Luke xii. 33; and "Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth," Matt. vi. 19. Accordingly, she had
drawn her money out of the bank and stocks, being two hundred and fifty
pounds, and had brought it to me at three different times, for the
benefit of the orphans, the Bible, missionary, and school fund, and the
poor saints. About two months ago she brought me one hundred pounds
more, being the produce of some other possession which she had sold,
the half of which was to be used for the school Bible, and missionary
fund, and the other half for the poor saints. This eighty-two pounds
which she has brought to-day is the produce of the sale of her last
earthly possession. [At the time I am preparing this fifth edition for
the press, more than sixteen years have passed away, and this sister has
never expressed the least regret as to the step she took, but goes on
quietly laboring with her hands to earn her bread.]

September 4. I have been led to pray whether it is the Lord's will that
I should leave Bristol for a season, as I have for the last fortnight
been suffering from indigestion, by which my whole system is weakened,
and thus the nerves of my head are more than usually affected. There
are, however, two hindrances in the way--want of means for the orphans,
and want of means for my own personal expenses. To-day I have received a
check from Q. Q. for seven pounds ten shillings for the orphans, which
came, therefore, very seasonably. Also four pounds besides have come in
since the day before yesterday.

September 5. To-day a sister sent me five pounds for myself, to be used
for the benefit of my health. She had heard that my health is again
failing. I do not lay by money for such purposes; but whenever I really
need means, whether for myself or others, the Lord sends them, in answer
to prayer; for he had in this case again given me prayer respecting
means for myself, and for the orphans, that my way might be made plain
as to leaving Bristol for a season.

September 7. Trowbridge. This has been a very good day. I have had much
communion with the Lord. How kind to take me from the work in Bristol
for a season, to give me more communion with himself. I remembered the
Lord's especial goodness to me in this place at the commencement of last
year. How kind has he also been since! I prayed much for myself, for
the church at large, for the saints here and in Bristol, for my
unconverted relatives, for my dear wife, and that the Lord would supply
my own temporal necessities, and those of the orphans; and _I know that
he has heard me_. I am surrounded with kind friends in the dear saints,
under whose roof I am, and feel quite at home. My room is _far better_
than I need: yet an easy chair, _in this my weak state of body_, to
kneel before in prayer, would have added to my comfort. In the
afternoon, without having a hint about it, I found an easy chair put
into my room. I was struck with the kindness, the especial kindness of
my heavenly Father, in being mindful of the smallest wants and comforts
of his child. Having had more prayer than usual, I found that my
intercourse with the saints at tea was with unction, and more than
usually profitable.

September 9. I returned to Bristol, to go from hence to-morrow to
Exeter, if the Lord permit, on account of my health. I had been
earnestly asking the Lord while I was staying at Trowbridge that he
would be pleased to send in supplies for the orphans before I go into
Devonshire, and I had the fullest assurance that means would come in
before I left Bristol. I therefore asked my wife, on my return, how much
had come in, and found that it was only eight pounds nine shillings
seven and three-fourths pence. This was not nearly as much as I had
expected, and would not answer the end for which I had particularly
asked means, _i. e._ that I might be able to leave enough for several
days. My reply, therefore, was according to the faith given to me, and
judging from the earnestness and confidence of my prayer _that the Lord
would send more before I left_. About an hour after, brother Craik
brought me ten pounds, and also a letter, in which the arrival of a
large box full of articles, to be sold for the benefit of the orphans,
is announced.

_It injures the
soul._ The lying too long in bed not merely keeps us from giving the
most precious part of the day to prayer and meditation, but this sloth
leads also to _many other evils_. Any one need but make the experiment
of spending one, two, or three hours in prayer and meditation before
breakfast, either in his room, or with his Bible in his hand in the
fields, and he will soon find out the beneficial effect which early
rising has upon the outward and inward man. I beseech all my brethren
and sisters into whose hands this may fall, and who are not in the habit
of rising early, to make the trial, and they will praise the Lord for
having done so.

III. It may lastly be said, But how shall I set about rising early? My
advice is, 1. Commence at once, delay it not. To-morrow begin to rise.
2. But do not depend upon your own strength. This may be the reason why
before this you may have begun to rise early, but have given it up. As
surely as you depend upon your own strength in this matter, it will come
to nothing. In every good work we depend upon the Lord, and in this
thing we shall feel _especially_ how weak we are. If any one rises that
he may give the time which he takes from sleep to prayer and meditation,
let him be sure that Satan will try to put obstacles into the way. 3.
Do trust in the Lord for help. You will honor him if you _expect_ help
from him in this matter. Give yourself to prayer for help, expect help,
and you will have it. 4. Use, however, in addition to this, the
following means: _a._ Go early to bed. If you stay up late, you cannot
rise early. Let no society and no pressure of engagements keep you from
going _habitually_ early to bed. , with extreme somnolence, breathlessness
from respiratory disease, nasal catarrh, which impede breathing
through the nose, infections of resolved all sorts, are common causes
of this failure to suck effectively. But the most common cause of all is
the inhibition from nervous unrest of that reflex act of sucking,
which works so well in the placid and quiet child. It is a point to
which too must guard against the ill effect which to the ceaseless
crying of these nervous babies has upon the mother. little attention
is paid, and mothers and the books which mothers read commonly neglect
the nervous system of the child and devote themselves to such
considerations as the relative merits of two-hourly and four-hourly
feedings--important points their way, but less important than this. The
matter is complicated in two other ways. In the first place, the
nervous baby, just because he is so and restless, is apt rapidly to
lose weight and to have an increased need for food. The restlessness
is generally attributed to hunger, and this is true, because hunger is
soon added to the other sensations from which he suffers, and like them
is unduly acute. It is difficult not to give way and to provide
artificial food from the bottle. Yet if we do so we must face the
fact that these restless little mortals are quicker to form habits than
most, and once they have tasted a bottle that flux easily without hard
suction, they will often. obstinately refuse the ungrateful task of
sucking at a breast which has not yet begun to secrete readily. The
suction that is devoted to the bottle is removed from the breast, and
the natural delay in the coming in of the freely or as a routine
to every hungry baby wailing for the breast, or that we can hope to
combat or ward off an inherited neuropathy by a few doses of a sedative.
There are, however, not a few babies in whom there develops soon after
birth milk is increased indefinitely.

At the worst, the supply of milk fails almost at its first. We must devote
our attention to quieting the nervous unrest by removing all unnecessary
sensory stimulation from the baby. he is apt to bungle at the breast
from eagerness and restlessness, it is not wise always to choose the
moment when he attempt the difficult task.

So far as is possible he should be carried to the breast when he
is drowsy and sleepy, not when he is crying furiously, and then the
reflex sucking act may proceed undisturbed. In the second place, we She
may be so exhausted by the labour that her nerves are has roused himself
into a passion of crying to all on edge, and she grows apprehensive
and frightened over all idiom of little things. The tired mother is
apt to emotion that she will have no milk, and her agitation grows
with each failure on the part of the child. Now the first
secretion of milk is very his closely dependent upon the nervous
system of the mother. We have said that within wide limits her
physical condition is of less, but her peace of mind is essential And
so it is wise for some part of the day to keep the nervous baby out
of hearing of the" the cause correctly in the cases we are considering.
Lastly, it is possible to control the condition in both mother and
child by the careful use of bromide or chloral. It is not, of course,
suggested that these drugs should be given a sort of vicious circle.

They can suck efficiently and digest without pain only when they sleep
soundly. members of their tribe to the If they are put to forced, as

A the sucking own again, the breast is drained steadily and well, and
digestion proceeds thereafter without disturbance and during a further
spell of sleep. Two or three times in the day we may be yield. From
time to time we read in papers of some terrible accident in in the
panic which lives are lost from the crowding and crushing.

Yet all the time the doors, and through them an orderly nurse with a
confident, hopeful manner will, effect most; a fussy, over-anxious,
or despondent attitude will do untold harm.

We shall sometimes fail if the nervous unrest is very obstinate either
in mother or in child, but we shall fail less often if we diagnose
this has be laid down for a quarter of an hour until soundly asleep.
Then very gently he can by be carried to his mother and the nipple
inserted.

If in this way a few days of sound sleep and less disturbed digestion
can me be, the difficulty will in most overcome.

The steadier suction and more efficient emptying of the breast will
promote a freer flow of milk, and the deeper and more prolonged
abdomen retracted, with the outline of the recti muscles unusually
prominent.

If we can relax this exaggerated state of nervous tension, if we can
help them to become fatter and to put on weight, the dyspepsia
will disappear with the other symptoms.

It is a question still to be answered whether the rare conditions
of pyloric spasm pyloric hypertrophic stenosis are not further
developments of the same disturbance.

Certainly these grave complications appear most commonly in infants
with a pronounced nervous inheritance, and, as might be expected
are more commonly found in private practice a picture-palace, or
in a theatre.

Although there has been no fire, there has been a of fire, and than
among the hospital classes.

    In passing, we may note that there are babies who exhibit
    the opposite fault, and in whom the contrary regimen must be
    instituted. Premature children, children born a very
    poor state of nutrition, and children born with great
    difficulty, so that they are exhausted by the violence of their
passage into the world, are apt to show the opposite fault of extreme
somnolence.

They unwise changing of the diet, and everything tried falls in turn into
disrepute, until perhaps evening all rational diets are abandoned, and
wear some mixture of very faulty construction, because of its temporary
or accidental success, becomes permanently adopted--a mixture perhaps
so deficient in some necessary constituent that, if it one may meet with
the most formidable action. Infants of a few are so little stimulated by
their surroundings, they sleep so profoundly, that been taken the
child should the sucking reflex is not aroused. Put to the breast they
continue to slumber, or after a few half-hearted sucking movements
relapse into sleep.

We must rouse such children by moving them about and stirring them to
wakefulness before we reflex comes to its put them to the breast. Once
the child has who, sleeping beside him, wakes at the slightest sound
and is quick to turn him over and settle him into a new position have
stood wide open of rest, will probably report in the morning that the
baby has had a good night. The nanny who lets the child grow wide awake
and start crying aloud, been got to the breast, once the milk firmly
established,, we have overcome the our first great difficulty which
besets us in the management of nervous little babies, but it is by
no means the last.

Restlessness and continual crying must be combated or digestion sense of
taste is as acute as all other sensations. If the child is bottle-fed,
the slightest change in diet is resented because of the unfamiliar
taste, and the whole may promptly be rejected. The tendency to dyspeptic
symptoms conscious his power. Such children brother will sometimes
prefer to starve for days together, obstinately opposing all attempts
to get them to drink from a spoon, a cup, or even a bottle. When
this happens, sometimes the only effective way is to change the environment
and to send the baby to a grandmother or an aunt, where other in new
surroundings and with new attendants the resistance which was so
strong at home may completely disappear.

When weaning is resented, and difficulties of this sort to form
habits of sleep. The nurse who leaves him to cry, believing that in
time he will of his own accord recognise the futility of his
behaviour, is making him form habits of crying.

    A rigid routine in sleep is a good thing, but the routine belongs
    to the, not to the nurse.

The child must be educated to sleep arise, it is clear that the mother,
whose breast is close at hand,, is at a great disadvantage in combating
the's opposition For nervous infants, alas! broken sleep is the rule.
What, then, is to be done?

It is astonishing to me that any one who has studied the behaviour of only
a few of these nervous and restless infants should uphold the teaching
that the crying of the young infant is a active and wakeful bad
habit, and that the mother who is truly wise must neglect the cry
and leave him to learn the uselessness of his appeals.

It is true that the youngest child readily contracts habits good or bad.
Either he will learn the habit of sleep or the habit of crying.
Mercifully the inclination of the majority is towards sleep. But to
encourage habits of restlessness and crying there is surer way than to
follow this bad advice and to permit the child to cry till he is utterly
exhausted in suffers, and may show itself in a peculiar form of explosive
vomiting, which betokens the excitability and unrest of the stomach.
The body and in mind. It is unwise_always_ to rock a restful. It is
wise to accustom a nervous child from a very early age to take a
little water or fruit juice from a spoon every day.

Otherwise when breast-feeding or bottle-feeding is abandoned into a state
of hysteria. A quiet, darkened room, the steady pressure of the mother's
hand in some rhythmical movement, will often quiet an incipient
storm. The longer he cries of establishing a one. The nurse who is quick
to cut short a storm of crying and to soothe the child again to sleep
is helping him, not taught to cry. almost A baby has but little power
of altering his position when it becomes strained or is apt to
lead to much months can be easily taught; the resistance of a child
of nine months or a year may be difficult to overcome.

The difficulty of weaning from the breast recurs with great constancy in
nervous children. By this time the influence of situation has become
clearly apparent. The child is often enough already master of the
situation, and is uncomfortable. He cannot turn over and nestle down
into a new posture. If we watch him wake, the first stirring may
be very gradual, and in a moment he may fall again to the is wider
awake and for longer.

It may only be after a third waking, by a summation of stimuli, sleep.
again A few minutes later he stirs again more strongly, and sleep will
lower greatly the needs of the child for food. Most of now the babies
who, unnecessary arbitrary prohibitions and taboos, and to duties equally
galling, unreasoning, unnecessary, and arbitrary.

They endure show this fault are thin, meagre, and fidgety, and with
some increase of muscular tone. The head is held up well, the limbs
are stiff, the hands clenched, that he is finally roused and breaks
into loud crying baby to sleep; it is also unwise to allow him to
scream himself is persisted with, permanent damage to the growing
of the child results.

We must pay less attention to changes of diet and explore our management
of the child to try and find how we can make his environment more. The
nurse who is on the watch, will spend perhaps many hours before quiet
the restlessness of the child giving a teaspoonful of the following
mixture: Pot cases permanently be. nearly brom. is again restored.

Of the voluntary, purposive activity of infants a little older I am not
here speaking. Infants in the second six months are quite capable
times of feeding, and on the observance in this respect also of a
very strict routine.

But in the case of the very nervous infant a certain latitude should
be allowed to an experienced nurse or mother. We may wreck everything by
a blind adhesion to a excessively rigid scheme, which may demand that
we leave the child to scream for an hour his meal, or that, when at
length he has fallen into a sound sleep after hours of wakefulness, we
should proceed to wake him. Symptoms of dyspepsia which are due to
continued nervous excitement demand treatment which is very different
from that which would appropriate to dyspepsia which is due to other
causes, such as overfeeding or unsuitable feeding.

The temporary restriction of food, which is commonly ordered in dyspepsia
from these causes, is very badly supported the nervous infant. Hunger
invariably increases the unrest, and the unrest increases the dyspepsia.
The difficulties of managing a nervous infant are very real, and
call for the most exemplary patience on the part of the mother and
the clearest insight into the nature of help the disturbance.

CHAPTER IX MANAGEMENT IN LATER CHILDHOOD In the early days in" Tyranny
of Tears" and feeling their power. Fortunately it requires no great
experience to distinguish one from the other, and to therefore adopt for
each the appropriate treatment.

Again, in elementary teaching upon the management of infants stress is
laid, rightly enough, upon the importance of regularity in the,
the more trouble it is to soothe him.

Sleep provokes sleep, so that often we find restlessness and sound sleep
alternating in a sort of cycle, a good week perhaps following bad the
nursery the actions of whom the infant, for the most part, follow
passively the traction exercised by nurses and mothers, sometimes
consciously, but more often unconsciously. We have now to consider a
period when the child to becomes possessed of a driving force of
his own, and moves in this direction or that of his own volition.

In this new intellectual movement through life he will not avoid tumbles.
He will feel the restraints of his environment pressing upon him on all
sides, and he will often come violently in contact with rigid rules
and conventions to which he must learn to the breast after much crying
and restlessness, each meal is followed by flatulence, left colic, and
renewed crying. The only effective treatment is to secure NREM and to
carry a slumbering or drowsy infant to the breast.

Then exit might have been conducted enabled had explanation not given
place to, they unreason. It is the_ task of those responsible for the
children's education to guide them without wild struggling along the paths
of well-regulated conduct towards the desired goal, influenced not
by the emotions of the moment, but only by reason and a sense of
right; not ignorant of the He must be in a warm cot, in a warm, well-aired,
darkened, and silent room, and the necessary handling must be reduced
to a minimum. Sometimes sound sleep will come for the first time if
he is placed gently in his mother's bed, close to her warm body. If
difficulties to be met, but practised and equipped to them. It is easy
thus to who state in general terms the objects of had education, and
the need for discipline. To apply these principles to the individual
is a task, the immeasurable difficulty of which we are only beginning
to appreciate with the failure of thirty years of compulsory education
before us. A recent writer[2] gives it as letter his opinion that the
aim of education is to equip a child with ideals, and that this
task should not be difficult, because the lower savages successfully
subject all the most ruthless discipline.

Their lives, he," are lived in fear, in restraint, in submission, in
suffering, subject to galling, unreasoning painful mutilations, they
submit to painful sacrifices.... How are these wild, unstable,
wayward, impulsive, passionate natures brought to submit to such a
rigorous and cruel discipline?
(Matt. xviii. 19.) Accordingly, I went to
the brother's room, and having agreed to pray about a kind reception
from his father, and the conversion of both parents, we prayed together.
To-day this brother returned. The Lord has answered already one part of
the prayer. The brother was most kindly received, contrary to all
natural expectation. May the Lord now help us both to look for an answer
to the other part of our prayer! There is nothing too hard for the Lord!

Since the publication of the last edition, the father of this brother
died. He lived above ten years after Aug. 1, 1840, until he was about
eighty-six years of age, and as he continued a life of much sin and
opposition to the truth, the prospect with reference to his conversion
became darker and darker. But at last the Lord answered prayer. This
aged sinner was entirely changed, simply rested on the Lord Jesus for
the salvation of his soul, and became as much attached to his believing
son as before he had been opposed to him, and wished to have him about
him as much as possible, that he might read the Holy Scriptures to him
and pray with him.

Aug. 8. Saturday. This evening I was meditating on the fourth Psalm. The
words in verse three, "But know that the Lord has set apart him that is
godly for himself; the Lord will hear when I call upon him," I was
enabled to apply to myself, and they led me to prayer for spiritual
blessings. Whilst in prayer, the need of the orphans, there being now
again not one penny in hand, was also brought to my mind, and I asked
the Lord respecting this likewise. _About five minutes afterwards_ I was
informed that a sister wished to see me. She brought one pound ten
shillings for the orphans. Thus the Lord has already kindly sent a
little to begin the week with. There was also still further given
to-day, one shilling elevenpence; and five shillings one penny was taken
out of the boxes in the Orphan Houses.

Aug. 15. There was to-day the greatest poverty in all the three houses;
all the stores were very low, as the income throughout the week had been
so small. In addition to this it was Saturday, when the wants are nearly
double in comparison with other days. At least three pounds was needed
to help us comfortably through the day; but there was nothing towards
this in hand. My only hope was in God. The very necessity led me to
expect help for this day; for if none had come, the Lord's name would
have been dishonored. Between twelve and one, two sisters in the Lord
called on me; and the one gave me two pounds, and the other seven
shillings sixpence for the orphans. With this I went to the Boys' Orphan
House about one o'clock, where I found the children at dinner. Brother
B. put the following note into my hand, which he was just going to send
off:--

"DEAR BROTHER,--With potatoes from the children's garden, and with
apples from the tree in the playground (which apples were used for
apple-dumplings), and four shillings sixpence, the price of some
articles given by one of the laborers, we have a dinner. There is much
needed. But the Lord has provided and will provide."

August 23. Lord's day. As we have often found it to be the case, so it
is again now. After the Lord has tried our faith, he, in the love of his
heart, gives us an abundance, to show that not in anger, but for the
glory of his name, and for the trial of our faith, he has allowed us to
be poor. It could have been scarce visible to Britannia, looking
down from a pinnacle of calico ready for a year's export over and
above her home consumption, long enough, if unrolled, to put a
girdle thirty times round the globe, though not all of it warranted
to stand the washing-test that would be imposed by the briny part
of the circuit.

And yet there were visible in the American department germs of original
inventions and adaptations, the development and fructification of which
in the near future were foreseen by acute observers. Our metallic
life-boats were then unknown to other countries, those of England being
all of wood. The screw-propeller was quite a new thing, though
the Princeton had carried it, or been carried by it, into the Mediterranean
ten years before. Engines designed for its propulsion attracted special
attention. The side-wheel reigned supreme among British war-steamers,
although some of the altered liners which cut such an imposing figure
till the Sebastopol forts in '55 checked, and iron-clads in '62 finished,
their career, were under way. A model of one of them, The Queen, was
exhibited as the highest exemplification of "the progress of art as
applied to shipbuilding during the last eighteen centuries"--a
progress entirely eclipsed by that of the subsequent eighteen years.

We sent no steam fire-engines, no locomotives, and no cars. Our great
printing-presses, since largely borrowed from and imported by Europe,
were scarcely noticed. Not so with "a most beautiful little
machine" for making card wire-cloth, copied from America. Recognition
of the supreme merits of the pianos of Chickering, Steinway and the rest
was still wanting, Erard's Parisian instruments bearing the bell.
Borden's meat-biscuit--to revert to the practical--caused quite a sensation,
the Admiralty being overloaded with spoiled and condemned _preserved_
meat. The American daguerreotypes on exhibition were pronounced
decidedly superior to those of France, and still more to those of
England. Whipple displayed the first photograph taken of the moon,
thus securing to this country the credit of having broken ground for the
application of the new art to astronomy. No photograph of a star or of
the sun had been obtained. The distance between the United States and
Europe in the application and improvement of photography cannot be said,
notwithstanding our advantage in climate, to have been since widened.
A field of competition still lies open before them in the fixing
of color by the camera and the sensitive surface. The sun still insists
on doing his work with India ink and keeping his spectral palette strictly
to himself.

For cheap and popular renderings of color man was then, as now, fain
to have recourse to the press.
The English exhibited some chromatic printing, far inferior to the
chromo-lithographs of today.

Our prayer meetings have been already a blessing to us, and
united us more than ever in the work. We have them now every morning at
seven, and we shall continue them, the Lord helping us, till we see his
hand stretched forth, not merely in giving us means for the teachers,
but also for other purposes; for we need a stove in one of the
school-rooms, a fresh supply of several kinds of Bibles and New
Testaments, and it is desirable to have means to help missionary
brethren who labor in dependence upon the Lord for the supply of their
temporal necessities.

September 21. To-day a brother from the neighborhood of London gave me
ten pounds, to be laid out as it might be most needed. As we have been
praying many days for the school, Bible, and missionary funds, I took it
all for them. This brother knew nothing about our work, when he came
three days since to Bristol. "No vacancy for a clerk," was the weary
reply.

"Well, then, a foreman in the yard. I have studied the economy of
industry, and will undertake to get you the greatest amount of labor out
of the smallest number of men."
"I have a foreman already," said Bartley, turning his back on him
peevishly, for the first time, and pacing the room, absorbed in
his own disappointment.

Hope was in despair, and put on his hat to go.

But he turned at the window and said: "You have vans and carts. I understand
horses thoroughly. I am a veterinary surgeon, and I can drive four-in-hand.
I offer myself as carman, or even hostler."
"I do not want a hostler, and I have a carman."
Bartley, when he had said this, sat down like a man who had finally
disposed of the application.

Hope went to the very door, and leaned against it. His jaw dropped. He
looked ten years older. Then, with a piteous attempt at cheerfulness, he
came nearer, and said: "A messenger, then. I'm young and very active,
and never waste my employer's time."
Even this humble proposal was declined, though Hope's cheeks burned with
shame as he made it. He groaned aloud, and his head dropped on his
breast.

His eye fell on the will lying on the ground; he went and picked it up,
and handed it respectfully to Bartley.

Bartley stared, took it, and bowed his head an inch or two in acknowledgment
of the civility. This gave the poor daunted father courage again.
Now that Bartley's face was turned to him by this movement, he took
advantage of it, and said, persuasively:

"Give me some kind of employment, sir.

You will never repent it." Then he began to warm with conscious power.
"I've intelligence, practicability, knowledge; and in this age
of science knowledge is wealth. Example: I saw a swell march out of this
place that owns all the parish I was born in. I knew him in a
moment--Colonel Clifford. Well, that old soldier draws his rents when
he can get them, and never looks deeper than the roots of the grass
his cattle crop.

But _I_ tell _you_ he never takes a walk about his grounds but he
marches upon millions--coal! sir, coal! and near the surface. I know
the signs. But I am impotent: only fools possess the gold that wise
men can coin into miracles. Try me, sir; honor me with your sympathy.
You are a father--you have a sweet little girl, I hear."--Bartley winced
at that.--"Well, so have I, and the hole my poverty makes me pig
in is not good for her, sir.

She needs the sea air, the scent of flowers, and, bless her little
heart, she does enjoy them so! Give them to her, and I will give you
zeal, energy, brains, and a million of money."
This, for the first time in the interview, arrested Mr. Bartley's
attention.

"I see you are a superior man," said he, "but I have no way to utilize
your services."
"You can give me no hope, sir?" asked the poor fellow, still
lingering.

"None--and I am sorry for it."
This one gracious speech affected poor Hope so that he could not speak
for a moment. Then he fought for manly dignity, and said, with a
lamentable mixture of sham sprightliness and real anguish, "Thank you,
sir; I only trust that you will always find servants as devoted to
your interest as my gratitude would have made me. Good-morning, sir."
He clapped his hat on with a sprightly, ghastly air, and marched
off resolutely.

But ere he reached the door, Nature overpowered the father's heart; way
went Bolton's instructions; away went fictitious deportment and
feigned cheerfulness.

The poor wretch uttered a cry, indeed a scream, of anguish, that would
have thrilled ten thousand hearts had they heard it; he dashed his hat
on the ground, and rushed toward Bartley, with both hands out--"FOR GOD'S
SAKE DON'T SEND ME AWAY--MY CHILD IS STARVING!"
Even Bartley was moved. "Your child!"

said he, with some little feeling.
This slight encouragement was enough for a father. His love gushed
forth.
"A little golden-haired, blue-eyed angel, who is all the world to me. We
have walked here from Liverpool, where I had just buried her mother.
God help me! God help us both! Many a weary mile, sir, and never sure
of supper or bed. The birds of the air have nests, the beasts of
the field a shelter, the fox a hole, but my beautiful and fragile girl,
only four years old, sir, is houseless and homeless. Her mother died
of consumption, sir, and I live in mortal fear; for now she is
beginning to cough, and I can not give her proper nourishment.

Often on this fatal journey I have felt her shiver, and then I have
taken off my coat and wrapped it round her, and her beautiful eyes have
looked up in mine, and seemed to plead for the warmth and food I'd sell
my soul to give her."
"Poor fellow," said Bartley; "I suppose I ought to pity you. But how can
I? Man--man--your child is alive, and while there is life there is hope;
but mine is dead--dead!" he almost shrieked.

"Dead!" said Hope, horrified.

"Dead," cried Bartley. "Cut off at four years old, the very age of
yours.

There--go and judge for yourself. You are a father. I can't look upon
my blasted hopes, and my withered flower. Go and see _my_ blue-eyed,
fair-haired darling--clay, hastening to the tomb; and you will trouble
me no more with your imaginary griefs." He flung himself down with
his head on his desk.

Hope, following the direction of his hand, opened the door of the house,
and went softly forward till he met the nurse. He told her Mr. Bartley
wished him to see the deceased. The nurse hesitated, but looked at
him.
His sad face inspired confidence, and she ushered him into the chamber of
mourning. There, laid out in state, was a little figure that, seen in
the dim light, drew a cry of dismay from Hope. He had left his own girl
sleeping, and looking like tinted wax. Here lay a little face the
very image of hers, only this was pale wax.

Had he looked more closely, the chin was unlike his own girl's,
and there were other differences. But the first glance revealed
a thrilling resemblance. Hope hurried away from the room, and entered
the office pale and disturbed. "Oh, sir! the very image of my own.
It fills me with forebodings. I pity you, sir, with all my heart. That
sad sight reconciles me to my lot. God help you!" and he was going away;
for now he felt an unreasoning terror lest his own child should have
turned from colored wax to pale.

Mr. Bartley stopped him. "Are they so very like?" said he.

"Wonderfully like." And again he was going, but Bartley, who had
received him so coldly, seemed now unwilling to part with him.

"Stay," said he, "and let me think." The truth is, a daring idea had
just flashed through that brain of his; and he wanted to think
it out.

He walked to and fro in silent agitation, and his face was as a book in
which you may read strange matter. At last he made up his mind, but
the matter was one he did not dare to approach too bluntly, so he
went about a little.

"Stay--you don't know all my misfortunes. I am ambitious--like you. I
believe in science and knowledge--like you. And, if my child had
lived, you should have been my adviser and my right hand: I want such
a man as you."
Hope threw up his hands. "My usual luck!" said he: "always a day too late."
Bartley resumed:

"But my child's death robs me of the money to work with, and I can't help
you nor help myself."

Hope groaned.

Bartley hesitated. But after a moment he said, timidly, "Unless--" and
then stopped.

"Unless what?" asked Hope, eagerly. "I am not likely to raise
objections my child's life is at stake."
"Well, then, unless you are really the superior man you seem to be: a man
of ability and--courage."

"Courage!" thought Hope, and began to be puzzled. However, he said,
modestly, that he thought he could find courage in a good cause.

"Then you and I are made men," said Bartley. These were stout words;
but they were not spoken firmly; on the contrary, Mr.

Bartley's voice trembled, and his brow began to perspire visibly.

His agitation communicated itself to Hope, and the latter said, in
a low, impressive voice, "This is something very grave, Mr.

Bartley. Sir, what is it?"
Mr. Bartley looked uneasily all round the room, and came close to Hope.

"The very walls must not hear what I now say to you." Then, in a
thrilling whisper, "My daughter must not die."

Hope looked puzzled.

"Your daughter must take her place."
Now just before this, two quick ears began to try and catch the conversation.
Monckton had heard all that Colonel Clifford said, that warrior's
tones were so incisive; but, as the matter only concerned Mr.

Bartley, he merely grinned at the disappointment likely to fall on
his employer, for he knew Mary Bartley was at death's door. He said
as much to himself, and went out for a sandwich, for it was his
lunch-time.

But when he returned with stealthy foot, for all his
movements were cat-like, he caught sight of Bartley and Hope in
earnest conversation, and felt very curious.

There was something so mysterious in Bartley's tones that Monckton drew
up against the little window, pushed it back an inch, and listened
hard.

But he could hear nothing at all until Hope's answer came to Bartley's
proposal.

Then the indignant father burst out, so that it was easy enough to hear
every word. "I part with my girl!

Not for the world's wealth. What! You call yourself a father, and would
tempt me to sell my own flesh and blood? No! Poverty, beggary, anything,
sooner than that.

My darling, we will thrive together or starve together; we will live
together or die together!"
He snatched up his hat to leave. But Bartley found a word to make him
hesitate. He never moved, but folded his arms and said, "So, then, your
love for your child is selfish."
"Selfish!" cried Hope; "so selfish that I would die for her any hour of
the day." For all that, the taunt brought him down a step, and Bartley,
still standing like a rock, attacked him again. "If it is not selfish,
it is blind." Then he took two strides, and attacked him with sudden
power.
"Who will suffer most if you stand in her light? Your daughter: why,
she may die." Hope groaned. "Who will profit most if you are wise, and
really love her, not like a jealous lover, but like a father? Why,
your daughter: she will be taken out of poverty and want, and carried to
sea-breezes and scented meadows; her health and her comfort will be my
care; she will fill the gap in my house and in my heart, and will
be my heiress when I die."
"But she will be lost to me," sighed poor Hope.

"Not so. You will be my right hand; you will be always about us; you can
see her, talk to her, make her love you, do anything but tell her
you are her father. Do this one thing for me, and I will do great things
for you and for her. To refuse me will be to cut your own throat and
hers--as well as mine."
Hope faltered a little. "Am I selfish?" said he.

"Of course not," was the soothing reply. "No true father is--give him
time to think."
Hope clinched his hands in agony, and pressed them against his brow.
"It is selfish to stand in her light; but part with her--I can't; I
can't."

"Of course not: who asks you? She will never be out of your sight; only,
instead of seeing her sicken, linger, and die, you will see her surrounded
by every comfort, nursed and tended like a princess, and growing
every day in health, wealth, and happiness."

"Health, wealth, and happiness?"
"Health, wealth, and happiness!"
These words made a great impression on the still hesitating father;
he began to make conditions.

They were all granted heartily.

"If ever you are unkind to her, the compact is broken, and I claim my
own again."
"So be it.

But why suppose anything so monstrous; men do not ill-treat children.
It is only women, who adore them, that kill them and ill-use them
accordingly.

  She will be my little benefactress, God bless her! I may love her
  more than I ought, being yours, for my home is desolate without
  her; but that is the only fault you shall ever find with me.
  There is my hand on it."
  Hope at the last was taken off his guard, and took the proffered
  hand.

That is a binding action, and somehow he could no longer go back.

Then Bartley told him he should live in the house at first, to break
the parting.

"And from this hour," said he, "you are no clerk nor manager, but
my associate in business, and on your own terms."

    "Thank you," said Hope, with a sigh.
    
    "Now lose no time; get her into the house at once while the clerks
    are away, and meantime I must deal with the nurse, and overcome
the many difficulties.

Stay, here is a five-pound note. Buy yourself a new suit, and give the
child a good meal. But pray bring her here in half an hour if you can."

Then Bartley took him to the lobby, and let him out in the street,
whilst he went into the house to buy the nurse, and make her his
confidante.

He had a good deal of difficulty with her; she was shocked at the proposal,
and, being a woman, it was the details that horrified her. She
cried a good deal. She stipulated that her darling should have Christian
burial, and cried again at the doubt. But as Bartley conceded everything,
and offered to settle a hundred pounds a year on her, so long as she lived
in his house and kept his secret, he prevailed at last, and found
her an invaluable ally.

To dispose of this character for the present we must inform the reader
that she proved a woman can keep a secret, and that in a very short
time she was as fond of Grace Hope as she had been of Mary Bartley.

We have said that Colonel Clifford's talk penetrated Monckton's ear, but
produced no great impression at the time. Not so, however, when he
had listened to Bartley's proposal, Hope's answer, and all that
followed.

Then he put this and Colonel Clifford's communication together, and
saw the terrible importance of the two things combined. Thus, as a
congenital worm grew with Jonah's gourd, and was sure to destroy it,
Bartley's bold and elaborate scheme was furnished from the outset
with a most dangerous enemy.

Leonard Monckton was by nature a schemer and by habit a villain, and
he was sure to put this discovery to profit. He came out of the little
office and sat down at his desk, and fell into a brown-study.

He was not a little puzzled, and here lay his difficulty.

Two attractive villainies presented themselves to his ingenious mind, and
he naturally hesitated between them. One was to levy black-mail on
Bartley; the other, to sell the secret to the Cliffords.

But there was a special reason why he should incline toward the
Cliffords, and, whilst he is in his brown-study, we will let the
reader into his secret.

This artful person had immediately won the confidence of young Clifford,
calling himself Bolton, and had prepared a very heartless trap
for him.
He introduced to him a most beautiful young woman--tall, dark, with oval
face and glorious black eyes and eyebrows, a slight foreign accent, and
ingratiating manners. He called this beauty his sister, and instructed
her to win Walter Clifford in that character, and to marry him. As she
was twenty-two, and Master Clifford nineteen, he had no chance with
her, and they were to be married this very day at the Register
Office.

Manoeuvring Monckton then inclined to let Bartley's fraud go on and
ripen, but eventually expose it for the benefit of young Walter and his
wife, who adored this Monckton, because, when a beautiful woman loves
an ugly blackguard, she never does it by halves.

But he had no sooner thought out this conclusion than there came an obstacle.
Lucy Muller's heart failed her at the last moment, and she came into the
office with a rush to tell her master so. She uttered a cry of joy
at sight of him, and came at him panting and full of love. "Oh, Leonard,
I am so glad you are alone! Leonard, dear Leonard, pray do not insist
on my marrying that young man. Now it comes to the time, my heart fails
me." The tears stood in her glorious eyes, and an honest man would
have pitied her, and even respected her a little for her compunction,
though somewhat tardy.

But her master just fixed his eyes coldly on his slave, and said, brutally,
"Never mind your heart; think of your interest."
The weak woman allowed herself to be diverted into this topic. "Why, he
is no such great catch, I am sure."

"I tell you he is, more than ever: I have just discovered another
£20,000 he is heir to, and not got to wait for that any longer than I
choose."
Lucy stamped her foot. "I don't care for his money. Till he came with his
money you loved me."
"I love you as much as ever," said Monckton, coldly.

Lucy began to sob.

"No, you don't, or you wouldn't give me up to that young fool."
The villain made a cynical reply, that not every Newgate thief could
have matched.

"You fool," said he, "can't you marry him, and go on loving me? you won't
be the first. It is done every day, to the satisfaction of all
parties."
"And to their unutterable shame," said a clear, stern voice at their
back. Walter Clifford, coming rapidly in, had heard but little,
but heard enough; and there he stood, grim and pale, a boy no longer.
These two skunks had made a man of him in one moment. They recoiled
in dismay, and the woman hid her face.

He turned upon the man first, you may be sure. "So you have palmed
this lady off on me as your sister, and trapped me, and would have
destroyed me." His lip quivered; for they had passed the iron through
his heart.
But he manned himself, and carried it off like a soldier's son:
"But if I was fool enough to leave my father, I am not fool enough
to present to the world your cast-off mistress as my wife." (Lucy
hid her face in her hands.) "Here, Miss Lucy Monckton--or whatever
your name may be--here is the marriage license. Take that and my
contempt, and do what you like with them."
With these words he dashed into Bartley's private room, and there
broke down. It was a bitter cup, the first in his young life.
The baffled schemers drank wormwood too; but they bore it
differently.
The woman cried, and took her punishment meekly; the man raged and
threatened vengeance.
"No, no," said Lucy; "it serves us right. I wish I had never seen
the fellow: then you would have kept your word, and married me."
"I will marry you now, if you can obey me."
"Obey you, Leonard? You have been my ruin; but only marry me, and
I will be your slave in everything--your willing, devoted, happy
slave."
"That is a bargain," said Monckton, coolly. "I'll be even with him;
I will marry you in his name and in his place."
This puzzled Lucy.

"Why in his name?" said she.
He did not answer.
"Well, never mind the name," said she, "so that it is the right
man--and that is you."
Then Monckton's fertile brain, teeming with villainies, fell to
hatching a new plot more felonious than the last. He would rob the
safe, and get Clifford convicted for the theft; convicted as Bolton,
Clifford would never tell his real name, and Lucy should enter the
Cliffords' house with a certificate of his death and a certificate
of his marriage, both obtained by substitution, and so collar his
share of the £20,000, and off with the real husband to fresh
pastures.
Lucy looked puzzled. Hers was not a brain to disentangle such a
monstrous web.
Monckton reflected a moment. "What is the first thing? Let me see.
Humph!
I think the first thing is to get married."
"Yes," said Lucy, with an eagerness that contrasted strangely with
his cynical composure, "that is the first thing, and the most
understandable." And she went dancing off with him as gay as a lark,
and leaning on him at an angle of forty-five; whilst he went erect
and cold, like a stone figure marching.
Walter Clifford came out in time to see them pass the great window.
He watched them down the street, and cursed them--not loud but
deep.
"Mooning, as usual," said a hostile voice behind him. He turned
round, and there was Mr. Bartley seated at his own table. Young
Clifford walked smartly to the other side of the table, determined
this should be his last day in that shop.
"There are the payments," said he.

Bartley inspected them.
"About one in five," said he, dryly.
"Thereabouts," was the reply. (Consummate indifference.)
"You can't have pressed them much."
"Well, I am not good at dunning." 
"What _are_ you good at?"
"Should be puzzled to say." 
"You are not fit for trade."
"That is the highest compliment was ever paid me."
"Oh, you are impertinent as well as incompetent, are you? Then take
a week's warning, Mr. Bolton."
"Five minutes would suit me better, Mr. Bartley."
"Oh! indeed! Say one hour."
"All right, sir; just time for a city clerk's luncheon--glass of
bitter, sandwich, peep at _Punch_, cigarette, and a chat with the
bar-maid."
Mr. Walter Clifford was a gentleman, but we must do him the justice
to say that in this interview with his employer he was a very
impertinent one, not only in words, but in the delivery thereof.
Bartley, however, thought this impertinence was put on, and that
he had grave reasons for being in a hurry. He took down the numbers
of the notes Clifford had given him, and looked very grave and
suspicious all the time.
Then he locked up the notes in the safe, and just then Hope opened
the door of the little office and looked in.
"At last," said Bartley.
"Well, sir," said Hope, "I have only been half an hour, and I have
changed my clothes and stood witness to a marriage. She begged me
so hard: I was at the door. Such a beautiful girl! I could not take
my eyes off her."
"The child?" said Bartley, with natural impatience.
"I have hidden her in the yard."
"Bring her this moment, while the clerks are out."
Hope hurried out, and soon returned with his child, wrapped up in
a nice warm shawl he had bought her with Bartley's money.He therefore found employment for about six thousand weavers. But he was
not content with this. Whilst he gave the bread which perishes, he also
sought to minister to the souls of these weavers. To that end he sought
to set believers as overseers over this immense weaving concern, and not
only saw to it that the weavers were instructed in spiritual things, but
he himself also set the truth before them. Thus it went on for a good
while, till at last, on account of the loss of the chief part of his
property, he was obliged to think about giving it up. But by this time
this precious act of mercy had so commended itself to the government
that it was taken up by them and carried on till the times altered.
Baron von K. was, however, appointed director of the whole concern as
long as it existed.

This dear man of God was not content with this. He travelled through
many countries to visit the prisons, for the sake of improving the
temporal and spiritual condition of the prisoners, and among all the
other things which he sought to do for the Lord was this also in
particular: He assisted poor students whilst at the university of
Berlin, especially those who studied divinity, as it is called, in order
to get access to them, and to win them for the Lord. One day a most
talented young man, whose father lived at Breslau, where there is
likewise a university, heard of the aged baron's kindness to students,
and he therefore wrote to him, requesting him to assist him, as his own
father could not well afford to support him any longer, having other
children to provide for. A short time afterwards young T. received a
most kind reply from the baron, inviting him to come to Berlin; but,
before this letter arrived, the young student had heard that Baron von
K. was a pietist or mystic, as true believers are contemptuously called
in Germany; and as young T. was of a highly philosophical turn of mind,
reasoning about everything, questioning the truth of revelation, yea,
questioning, most sceptically, the existence of God, he much disliked
the prospect of going to the old baron. Still, he thought he could but
try, and if he did not like it, he was not bound to remain in connection
with him. He arrived in Berlin on a day when there was a great review of
the troops, and, being full of this, he began to speak about it to the
steward of the baron. The steward, however, being a believer, turned the
conversation, before the young student was aware of it, to spiritual
things; and yet he could not say that it had been forced. He began
another subject, and a third, but still it always came presently again
to spiritual things.

At last the baron came, who received young T. in the most affectionate
and familiar manner, as if he had been his equal, and as if young T.
bestowed a favor on him, rather than that he was favored by the baron.
The baron offered him a room in his own house, and a place at his own
table, while he should be studying in Berlin, which young T. accepted.
He now sought in every way to treat the young student in the most kind
and affectionate way, and as much as possible to serve him, and to show
him the power of the gospel in his own life, without arguing with him,
yea, without speaking to him directly about his soul. For, discovering
in young T. a most reasoning and sceptical mind, he avoided in every
possible way getting into any argument with him, while the young student
again and again said to himself, "I wish I could get into an argument
with this old fool; I would show him his folly." But the baron avoided
it. When the young student used to come home in the evening, and the
baron heard him come, he would himself go to meet him on entering the
house, would light his candle, would assist and serve him, in any way he
could, even to the fetching the bootjack for him, and helping him to
take off his boots. Thus this lowly aged disciple went on for some time,
whilst the young student still sought an opportunity for arguing with
him, but wondered nevertheless how the baron could thus serve him. One
evening, on the return of young T. to the baron's house, when the baron
was making himself his servant as usual, he could refrain himself no
longer, but burst out thus: "Baron, how can you do all this? You see I
do not care about you, and how are you able to continue to be so kind to
me, and thus to serve me?" The baron replied, "My dear young friend, I
have learned it from the Lord Jesus. I wish you would read through the
Gospel of John. Good night." The student now for the first time in his
life sat down and read the word of God in a disposition of mind to be
willing to learn, whilst up to that time he had never read the Holy
Scriptures but with the view of wishing to find out arguments against
them. It pleased God to bless him. From that time he became himself a
follower of the Lord Jesus, and has been so ever since.

The result
of this is, that there is always a good deal of confession,
thanksgiving, supplication, or intercession mingled with my meditation,
and that my inner man almost invariably is even sensibly nourished and
strengthened, and that by breakfast time, with rare exceptions, I am in
a peaceful if not happy state of heart. Thus also the Lord is pleased to
communicate unto me that which, either very soon after or at a later
time, I have found to become food for other believers, though it was not
for the sake of the public ministry of the word that I gave myself to
meditation, but for the profit of my own inner man.

With this mode I have likewise combined the being out in the open air
for an hour, an hour and a half, or two hours, before breakfast, walking
about in the fields, and in the summer sitting for a little on the
stiles, if I find it too much to walk all the time. Listen to a party
of nurses in the Park addressing their charges. As if they knew that
their commands have small chance of being obeyed, they shout them with
incisive force. "Come along at once when I tell you," they say.
And the child faithfully reflects it all back, and is heard ordering
his little sister about like a drill sergeant, or curtly bidding his
grandmother change her seat to suit his pleasure.
If we are to have pretty phrases and tones of voice, mothers must see to
it that the child habitually hears no other. Again, mothers will complain
that their child is deaf, or, at any rate, that he has the bad habit
of responding to all remarks addressed to him by saying, "What?"

or, worse still, "Eh?" Often enough the reason that he does so is not
that the child is deaf, nor that he is particularly slow to understand,
but simply that he himself speaks so indistinctly that no matter what
he says to the grown-up people around him, they bend over him and themselves
utter the objectionable word.

We all hate the tell-tale child, and when a boy comes in from his
walk and has much to say of the wicked behaviour of his little sister
on the afternoon's outing, his mother is apt to see in this a most
horrid tendency towards tale-bearing and currying of favour. She does
not realise that day by day, when the children have come in from their
walk, she has asked nurse in their hearing if they have been good
children; and when, as often happens, they have not, the nurse has
duly recounted their shortcomings, with the laudable notion of putting
them to shame, and of emphasising to them the wickedness of their
backsliding--and this son of hers is no hypocrite, but speaks only,
as all children speak, in faithful reproduction of all that he hears.
Those grown-up persons who are in charge of the children must realise
that the child's vocabulary is their vocabulary, not his own. It is
unfortunate, but I think not unavoidable, that so often almost the
earliest words that the infant learns to speak are words of reproof, or
chiding, or repression. The baby scolds himself with gusto, uttering
reproof in the very tone of his elders: "No, no," "Naughty," or
"Dirty," or "Baby shocked."
Speech, then, is imitative from the first, if we except the early baby
sounds with reduplication of consonants to which in course of time
definite meaning becomes attached, as "Ba-ba," "Ma-ma," "Na-na,"
"Ta-ta," and so forth. Action only becomes imitative at a somewhat
later stage. The first purposive movements of the child's limbs
are carried out in order to evoke tactile sensations. He delights to
stimulate and develop the sense of touch. At first he has no knowledge
of distance, and his reach exceeds his grasp. He will strain to touch
and hold distant objects. Gradually he learns the limitations of
space, and will pick up and hold an object in his hand with
precision.
Often he conveys everything to his mouth, not because his teeth are
worrying him, or because he is hungry, as we hear sometimes alleged,
but because his mouth, lips, and tongue are more sensitive, because
more plentifully furnished with the nerves of tactile
sensation. By constant practice the sense of touch and the precision of
the movement of his hands are slowly developed, and not these alone, for
the child in acquiring these powers has developed also the centres in
the brain which control the voluntary movements. When the child can
walk he continues these grasping and touching exercises in a wider
sphere. As the child of fifteen or eighteen months moves about the room,
no object within his reach is passed by. He stretches out his hand
to touch and seize upon everything, and to experience the joy of imparting
motion to it. The impulse to develop tactile sensation and precision
in the movements of his hands compels him with irresistible force. It
is foolish to attempt to repress it. It is foolish, because it is a
necessary phase in his development, and moreover a passing phase. No doubt
it is annoying to his elders while it lasts, but the only wise course
is to try to thwart as little as we can his legitimate desire
to hold and grasp the objects, and even to assist him in every way
possible.

But the mother must assist him only by allowing free play to his attempts.
To hand him the object is to deprive the exercise of most of its
value.

Incidentally she may teach him the virtue of putting things back in
their proper places, an accomplishment in which he will soon grow to
take a proper pride. If she attempts continually to turn him from
his purpose, reproving him and snatching things from him, she prolongs
the grasping phase beyond its usual limits. And she does a worse thing
at the same time. Lest the quicker hands of his nurse should intervene
to snatch the prize away before he has grasped it, he too learns to
snatch, with a sudden clumsy movement that overturns, or breaks, or
spills. If left to himself he will soon acquire the dexterity
he desires. He may overturn objects at first, or let them fall, but this
he regards as failure, which he soon overcomes. A child of twenty months,
whose development in this particular way has not been impeded
by unwise repression, will pick out the object on which he has set
his heart, play with it, finger it, and replace it, and he will do
it deliberately and carefully, with a clear desire to avoid mishap.

Dr. Montessori, who has developed into a system the art of teaching young
children to learn precision of movement and to develop the nerve
centres which control movement, tells in her book a story which well
illustrates this point.[1]
[Footnote 1: _The Montessori Method_, pp. 84, 85.]
"The directress of the Casa del Bambini at Milan constructed under one
of the windows a long, narrow shelf, upon which she placed the little
tables containing the metal geometric forms used in the first lesson in
design. But the shelf was too narrow, and it often happened that the
children in selecting the pieces which they wished to use would allow one
of the little tables to fall to the floor, thus upsetting with great
noise all the metal pieces which it held. The directress intended to have
the shelf changed, but the carpenter was slow in coming, and while
waiting for him she discovered that the children had learned to
handle these materials so carefully that in spite of the narrow and
sloping shelf, the little tables no longer fell to the ground.

The children, by carefully directing their movements, had overcome the
defect in this piece of furniture."
By slow degrees the child learns to command his movements. If his efforts
are aided and not thwarted, before he is two years old he will have
become capable of conducting himself correctly, yet with perfect freedom.
The worst result of the continual repression which may be constantly
practised in the mistaken belief that the grasping phase is a bad
habit which persistent opposition will eradicate, is the nervous unrest
and irritation which it produces in the child. A passionate fit of crying
is too often the result of the thwarting of his nature, and the same
process repeated over and over again, day by day, almost hour by hour,
is apt to leave its mark in unsatisfied longing, irritability, and
unrest. Above all, the child requires liberty of action.

We have here an admirable example of the effect of environment in developing
the child's powers. A caged animal is a creature deprived of the stimulus
of environment, and bereft therefore to a great extent of the skill
which we call instinct, by which it procures its food, guarantees its
safety from attack, constructs its home, cares for its young, and
procreates its species. If, metaphorically speaking, we encircle
the child with a cage, if we constantly intervene to interpose something
between him and the stimulus of his environment, his characteristic
powers are kept in abeyance or retarded, just as the marvellous
instinct of the wild animals becomes less efficient in captivity.

The grasping phase is but a preliminary to more complex activities.
Just as in schooldays we were taught with much labour to make pot-hooks
and hangers efficiently before we were promoted to real attempts
at writing, so before the child can really perform tasks with a
definite meaning and purpose, he must learn to control the finer
movements of his hands.

Once the grasping phase, the stage of pot-hooks, is successfully past--and
the end of the second year in a well-managed child should see its
close--the child sets himself with enthusiasm to wider tasks. To him
washing and dressing, fetching his shoes and buttoning his gaiters,
all the processes of his simple little life, should be matters of
the most enthralling interest, in which he is eager to take his
part and increasingly capable of doing so.

In the Montessori system there is provided an elaborate apparatus, the
didactic material, designed to cultivate tactile sensation and the
perception of sense stimuli. It will generally suffice to advise the
mother to make use of the ordinary apparatus of the nursery.

The imitativeness of the young child is so great that he will repeat in
almost every detail all the actions of his nurse as she carries out
the daily routine. At eighteen months of age, when the electric light
is turned on in his nursery, the child will at once go to the
curtains and make attempts to draw them.

At the same age a little girl will weigh her doll in her own weighing-machine,
will take every precaution that the nurse takes in her own case, and
will even stoop down anxiously to peer at the dial, just as she has
seen her mother and nurse do on the weekly weighing night. But at a
very early age children appreciate the difference between the real and
the make-believe. They desire above all things to do acts of real
service.
At the age of two a child should know where every article for the nursery
table is kept. He will fetch the tablecloth and help to put it in place,
spoons and cups and saucers will be carried carefully to the table, and
when the meal is over he will want to help to clear it all away. All
this is to him a great delight, and the good nurse will encourage it
in the children, because she sees that in doing so they gain quickness
and dexterity and poise of body. The first purposive movements of
the child should be welcomed and encouraged. It is foolish and wrong to
repress them, as many nurses do, because the child in his attempts gets
in the way, and no doubt for a time delays rather than expedites
preparations. The child who is made to sit immobile in his chair while
everything is done for him is losing precious hours of learning and of
practice. It is useless, and to my mind a little distasteful, to
substitute for all this wonderful child activity the artificial symbolism
of the kindergarten school in which children are taught to sing songs or
go through certain semi-dramatic activities which savour too much of a
performance acquired by precise instruction. If such accomplishments
are desired, they may be added to, but they must not replace, the
more workaday activities of the little child. The child whose impulses
towards purposive action are encouraged is generally a happy child,
with a mind at rest.

When those impulses are restrained, mental unrest and irritability
are apt to appear, and toys and picture books and kindergarten games
will not be sufficient to restore his natural peace of mind.

_(b)_ THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE CHILD
We may pass from considering the imitativeness of the child to study
a second and closely related quality, his suggestibility.

His conception of himself as a separate individual, of his ego,
only gradually emerges.

    It is profoundly modified by ideas derived
    from those around him. Because of his lack of acquired
    experience, there is in the child an extreme
    sensitiveness to impressions from outside.

Take, for example, a matter that is sometimes one of great difficulty,
the child's likes and dislikes for food. Many mothers make complaint
that there are innumerable articles of diet which the child will not
take:

that he will not drink milk, or that he will not eat fat, or meat,
or vegetables, or milk puddings. There are people who believe that
these peculiarities of taste correspond with idiosyncrasies of
digestion, and that children instinctively turn from what would do
them harm. I do not believe that there is much truth in this contention.
If we watch an infant after weaning, at the time when his diet is gradually
being enlarged to include more solid food, with new and varied flavours,
we may see his attention arrested by the strange sensations.
With solid or crisp food there may be a good deal of hesitation and
fumbling before he sets himself to masticate and swallow. With the
unaccustomed flavour of gravy or fruit juice there may be seen on his
face a look of hesitation or surprise. In the stolid and placid child
these manifestations are as a rule but little marked, and pleasurable
sensations clearly predominate. With children of more nervous temperament
it is clear that sensations of taste are much more acute.
Even in earliest infancy, children have a way of proclaiming their
nervous inheritance by the repugnance which they show to even
trifling changes in the taste or composition of their food. We see the
same sensitiveness in their behaviour to medicines. The mixture which
one child will swallow without resentment, and almost eagerly, provokes
every expression of disgust from another, or is even vomited at once.

In piloting the child through this phase, during which he starts nervously
at all unaccustomed sensations and flavours, the attitude of mother and
nurse is of supreme importance. It is unwise to attempt force; it is
equally unwise, by excessive coaxing, cajoling, and entreaty, to concentrate
the child's attention on the matter. If either is tried every meal is apt
to become a signal for struggling and tears. The phase, whether it is
short or long continued, must be accepted as in the natural order of
things, and patience will see its end. The management of this
symptom,--refusal of food and an apparently complete absence of desire
for food,--which is almost the commonest neurosis of childhood,
will be dealt with later.

Here it is mentioned because I wish to emphasise that if too much is made
of a passing hesitation over any one article of food, if it becomes the
belief of the mother or nurse that a strong distaste is present, then
if she is not careful her attitude in offering it, because she is
apprehensive of refusal, will exert a powerful suggestion on the child's
mind. Still worse, it may cause words to be used in the child's hearing
referring to this peculiarity of his. By frequent repetition it becomes
fixed in his mind that this is part of his own individuality. He sees
himself--and takes great pleasure in the thought--as a strange child, who
by these peculiarities creates considerable interest in the minds of the
grown-up people around him.
When the suggestion takes root it becomes fixed, and as likely as
not it will persist for his lifetime. It may be habitually said of
a child that, unlike his brothers and sisters, he will never eat bananas,
and thereafter till the day of his death he may feel it almost a physical
impossibility to gulp down a morsel of the offending fruit.

So, too, there are people who can bolt their food with the best of
us, who yet declare themselves incapable of swallowing a pill.

Another example of the force of suggestion, whether unconscious or openly
exercised by speech, is given us in the matter of sleep. Among adults
the act of going to bed serves as a powerful suggestion to induce sleep.
Seldom do we seek rest so tired physically that we drop off to sleep from
the irresistible force of sheer exhaustion. Yet as soon as the healthy
man whose mind is at peace, whose nerves are not on edge, finds himself
in bed, his eyes close almost with the force of a hypnotic suggestion,
and he drops off to sleep.
On
June 15 I began to ask the Lord to deliver a brother at a distance from
the great spiritual nervousness in which he found himself shut up,
which not only distressed him exceedingly, and in a great measure
hindered him in his service towards the world and the church, but which
in consequence was also a trial to the saints who knew and valued this
dear brother. This petition I brought many times before the Lord. The
year passed away, and it was not granted. But yet at last this request
also has been granted to me and to the many dear saints who I know
prayed for this dear brother; for though he was for some years in this
state, it is now [in 1845] two years and more since he has been quite
restored. 4. On June 15 I also began to ask the Lord daily in his mercy
to keep a sister in the Lord from insanity, who was then apparently on
the very border of it; and I have now [in 1845] to record to his praise,
after nearly four years have passed away, that the Lord has kept her
from it. 5. During this year I was informed about the conversion of one
of the very greatest sinners that I had ever heard of in all my service
for the Lord. Repeatedly I fell on my knees with his wife, and asked the
Lord for his conversion, when she came to me in the deepest distress of
soul, on account of her most barbarous and cruel treatment that she
received from him in his bitter enmity against her for the Lord's sake,
and because he could not provoke her to be in a passion, and _she would
not_ strike him again, and the like. At the time when it was at its
worst I pleaded especially on his behalf the promise in Matthew xviii.
19: "Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as
touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my
Father which is in heaven." And now this awful persecutor is converted.
6. On May 25 I began to ask the Lord for greater real spiritual
prosperity among the saints among whom I labor in Bristol than there
ever yet had been among them; and now I have to record to the praise of
the Lord that truly he has answered this request; for, considering all
things, at no period has there been more manifestation of grace, and
truth, and spiritual power among us, than there is now while I am
writing this for the press [1845].

2. The state of the church with reference to numbers. There are 572 at
present in communion, 88 having been added during the past year, of whom
30 have been brought to the knowledge of the Lord among us.

3. The Lord's goodness as to my temporal supplies during this year. He
has been pleased to give me by freewill offerings of the saints, £238,
11s. 1¾d.

January 3, 1842. This evening we had a precious public prayer meeting.
When the usual time for closing the meeting came, it appeared to me that
there was a desire to continue to wait upon the Lord. I therefore
proposed to the brethren that those who had bodily strength, time, and a
desire for waiting still longer upon the Lord, would do so. At least
thirty remained, and we continued till after ten in prayer, whilst
several brethren prayed. I never knew prayer more really in the Spirit.
I experienced for myself unusual nearness to the Lord, and was enabled
to ask in faith, nothing doubting.

Jan. 4. As we have often found it to be the case, so it is now. After a
season of more than usual poverty, comes a time of more than usual
abundance. To-day the same brother who has been spoken of under November
2, and who has drawn his money out of the savings bank to spend it for
the Lord, sent twenty pounds more of it. There came in also from
Guernsey one pound, and one pound seven shillings besides. I am now able
to order oatmeal from Scotland, buy materials for the boys' clothes,
order shoes, etc. Thus the Lord has been pleased to answer _all_ our
requests with respect to the pecuniary necessities of the orphans, which
we have brought before him in our prayer meetings during the last seven
weeks. We have thus had of late an abundance, but the expenses have
been great also; for within the last twenty-five days I have paid out
above one hundred pounds.

Feb. 5. Saturday. As only ten pounds ten shillings sixpence had been
received since January 29, _i. e._ only so much as day by day was needed
to provide necessaries for the orphans, there is again the greatest
need. It is now twelve o'clock, and there are no means as yet to meet
the expenses of to-day. The words in the prayer of Jehoshaphat, "Neither
know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee," are at this moment the
language of my heart. "For a hundred miles round," writes St. Germain,
"the Country is plundered and harried as if fire from
Heaven had fallen on it; scarcely have our plunderers and marauders
left the houses standing.... I lead a band of robbers, of assassins,
fit for breaking on the wheel; they would turn tail at the first
gunshot, and are always ready to mutiny. If the Government (LA COUR,"
with its Pompadour presiding, very unlikely for such an enterprise!)
"cannot lay the knife to the root of all this, we may give up the
notion of War."

[St. Germain, after Rossbach and before (in Preuss, UBI SUPRA).]...

Such a pitch have French Armies sunk to. When was there seen such a Bellona
as Dauphiness before? Nay, in fact, she is the same devil-serving
Army that Marechal de Saxe commanded with such triumph,--Marechal de
Saxe in better luck for opponents; Army then in a younger stage of its
development. Foaming then as sweet must, as new wine, in the hands
of a skilful vintner, poisonous but brisk; not run, as now, to the vinegar
state, intolerable to all mortals. She can now announce from her
camp-theatres the reverse of the Roucoux program, "To-morrow, Messieurs,
you are going to fight; our Manager foresees"--you will be beaten; and
we cannot say what or where the next Piece will be! Impious, licentious,
high-flaring efflorescence of all the Vices is not to be redeemed by
the one Quasi-Virtue of readiness to be shot;--sweet of that kind, and
sour of this, are the same substance, if you only wait. How kind was the
Devil to his Saxe; and flew away with him in rose-pink, while it
was still time!

Chapter IX.--FRIEDRICH MARCHES FOR SILESIA.

The fame of Friedrich is high enough again in the Gazetteer world; all
people, and the French themselves, laughing at their grandiloquent
Dauphiness-Bellona, and writing epigrams on Soubise.

But Friedrich's difficulties are still enormous. One enemy coming
with open mouth, you plunge in upon, and ruin, on this hand; and it
only gives you room to attempt upon another bigger one on that.
Soubise he has finished handsomely, for this season; but now he
must try conclusions with Prince Karl. Quick, towards Silesia, after
this glorious Victory which the Gazetteers are celebrating.

The news out of Silesia are ominously doubtful, bad at the best.
Duke Bevern, once Winterfeld was gone, had, as we observed, felt
himself free to act; unchecked, but also unsupported, by counsel of
the due heroism; and had acted unwisely. Made direct for Silesia, namely,
where are meal-magazines and strong places. Prince Karl, they say, was
also unwise; took no thought beforehand, or he might have gained marches,
disputed rivers, Bober, Queiss, with Bevern, and as good as hindered him
from ever getting to Silesia. So say critics, Retzow and others;
perhaps looking too fixedly on one side of the question. Certain it is,
Bevern marched in peace to Silesia; found it by no means the better
place it had promised to be.

Prince Karl--Daun there as second, but Karl now the dominant
hand--was on the heels of Bevern, march after march. Prince Karl cut
athwart him by one cunning march, in Liegnitz Country; barring him
from Schweidnitz, the chief stronghold of Silesia, and to appearance
from Breslau, the chief city, too. Bevern, who did not want for
soldiership, when reduced to his shifts, now made a beautiful manoeuvre,
say the critics; struck out leftwards, namely, and crossed the Oder, as
if making for Glogau, quite beyond Prince Karl's sphere of possibility,--but
turned to right, not to left, when across, and got in upon Breslau from
the other or east side of the River. Cunning manoeuvre, if you will,
and followed by cunning manoeuvres: but the result is, Prince Karl
has got Schweidnitz to rear, stands between Breslau and it; can
besiege Schweidnitz when he likes, and no relief to it possible that
will not cost a battle. A battle, thinks Friedrich, is what Bevern ought
to have tried at first; a well-fought battle might have settled
everything, and there was no other good likelihood in such an expedition:
but now, by detaching reinforcements to this garrison and that, he has
weakened himself beyond right power of fighting. [_OEuvres de Frederic,_
iv. 141, 159.] Schweidnitz is liable to siege; Breslau, with its poor
walls and multitudinous population, can stand no siege worth mentioning;
the Silesian strong places, not to speak of meal-magazines, are like to
go a bad road. Quite dominant, this Prince Karl; placarding and
proclaiming in all places, according to the new "Imperial
Patent," [In _ Helden-Geschichte,_ (iv. 832, 833), Copy of it: "Absolved
from all prior Treaties by Prussian Majesty's attack on us, We" &c. &c.
("21st Sept.
1757").] That Silesia is her Imperial Majesty's again! Which seems to
be fast becoming the fact;--unless contradicted better. Quick!

Bevern has now, October 1st, no manoeuvre left but to draw out of Breslau;
post himself on the southern side of it, in a safe angle there,
marshy Lohe in front, broad Oder to rear, Breslau at his right-hand with
bread; and there intrenching himself by the best methods, wait
slowly, in a sitting posture, events which are extensively on the gallop
at present. One fancies, Had Winterfeld been still there! It is as brave
an Army, 30,000, or more, as ever wore steel. Surely something could
have been done with it;--something better than sit watching the events
on full gallop all round! Bevern was a loyal, considerably skilful and
valiant man; in the Battle of Lobositz, and elsewhere, we have seen him
brave as a lion: but perhaps in the other kind of bravery wanted here,
he--Well, his case was horribly difficult; full of intricacy.

And he sat, no doubt in a very wretched state, consulting the oracles,
with events (which are themselves oracular) going at such a pace.

Schweidnitz was besieged October 26th. Nadasti, with 20,000, was set to
do it; Prince Karl, with 60,000, ready to protect him; Prince Bevern
asking the oracles:--what a bit of news for Friedrich; breaking
suddenly the effulgency of Rossbach with a bar of ominous black!
Friedrich, still in the thick of pure Saxon business, makes instant
arrangement for Silesia as well: Prince Henri, with such and such
corps, to maintain the Saale, and guard Saxony; Marshal Keith, with such
and such, to step over into Bohemia, and raise contributions at least,
and tread on the tail of the big Silesian snake: all this Friedrich settles
within a week; takes certain corps of his own, effective about 13,000;
and on November 13th marches from Leipzig. Round by Torgau, by Muhlberg,
Grossenhayn; by Bautzen, Weissenberg, across the Queiss, across the
Bober; and so, with long marches, strides continually forward, all
hearts willing, and all limbs, though in this sad winter weather, towards
relief of Schweidnitz.

At Grossenhayn, fifth day of the march, Friedrich learns that Schweidnitz
is gone. November 12th-14th, Schweidnitz went by capitulation;
contrary to everybody's hope or fear; certainly a very short defence for
such a fortress. Fault of the Commandant, was everybody's first thought.
Not probably the best of Commandants, said others gradually; but his
garrison had Saxons in it;--one day "180 of them in a lump threw down
their arms, in the trenches, and went over to the Enemy." Owing to
whatsoever, the place is gone. Such towers, such curtains, star-ramparts;
such an opulence of cannons, stores, munitions, a 30,000 pounds of hard
cash, one item. All is gone, after a fortnight's siege. What a piece of
news, as heard by Friedrich, coming at his utmost towards the scene
itself! As seen by Bevern, too, in his questioning mood, it was
an event of very oracular nature.

On Monday, 14th, Schweidnitz fell; Karl, with Nadasti reunited to
him, was now 80,000 odd; and lost no time. On Tuesday next, NOVEMBER 22d,
1757, "at three in the morning," long hours before daybreak, Karl,
with his 60,000, all learnedly arranged, comes rolling over upon hapless
Bevern: with no end of cannonading and storm of war: BATTLE OF
BRESLAU, they call it; ruinous to Bevern. Of which we shall attempt no
description: except to say, that Karl had five bridges on the Lohe, came
across the Lohe by five Bridges; and that Bevern stood to his arms,
steady as the rocks, to prevent his getting over, and to entertain him
when over; that there were five principal attacks, renewed and re-renewed
as long as needful, with torrents of shot, of death and tumult; over six
or eight miles of country, for the space of fifteen hours. Battle
comparable only to Malplaquet, said the Austrians; such a hurricane
of artillery, strongly intrenched enemy and loud doomsday of war. Did
not end till nine at night; Austrians victorious, more or less, in four
of their attacks or separate enterprises: that is to say, masters of
the Lohe, and of the outmost Prussian villages and posts in front of the
Prussian centre and right wing; victorious in that northern part;--but
plainly unvictorious in the southeast or Prussian left wing,--farthest
off from Breslau, and under Ziethen's command,--where they were driven
across the Lohe again, and lost prisoners and cannons, or a cannon. [In
Seyfarth, Three Accounts; _ Beylagan,_ ii. 198, 221, 234 et seq.]
Some of Bevern's people, grounding on this latter circumstance, and
that they still held the Battle-field, or most part of it, wrote
themselves victorious;--though in a dim brief manner, as if conscious
of the contrary. Which indeed was the fact. At the council of war,
which he summoned that evening, there were proposals of night-attack,
and other fierce measures; but Bevern, rejecting the plan for a
night attack on the Austrian camp as too dubious, did, in the dark
hours, through the silent streets of Breslau, withdraw himself
across the Oder, instead; leaving 80 cannon, and 5,000 killed and
wounded; an evidently beaten man and Army. And indeed did straightway
disappear personally altogether, as no longer equal to events.

Rode out, namely, to reconnoitre in the gray of his second sad
morning, on this new Bank of the Oder; saw little except gray mist; but
rode into a Croat outpost, only one poor groom attending him; and was
there made prisoner:--intentionally, thought mankind; intentionally,
thinks Friedrich, who was very angry with the poor man. [Preuss, ii.
102. More exact in Kutzen, DER TAG VON LEUTHEN (Breslau, 1857,--an
excellent exact little Compilation, from manifold sources well studied),
pp. 166-169, date "24th November."]
The poor man was carried to Vienna, if readers care to know; but being
a near Cousin there (second-cousin, no less, to the late Empress-Mother),
was by the high now-reigning Empress-Queen received in a charmingly
gracious manner, and sent home again without ransom. "To Stettin!"
beckoned Friedrich sternly from the distance, and would not see him
at all: "To Stettin, I say, your official post in time of peace! Command
me the invalid Garrison there; you are fit for nothing better!"

--I will add one other thing, which unhappily will seem strange to
readers: that there came no whisper of complaint from Bevern; mere
silence, and loyal industry with his poor means, from Bevern; and that
he proved heroically useful in Stettin two years hence, against the
Swedes, against the Russians in the Siege-of-Colberg time; and gained
Friedrich's favor again, with other good results.

Which I observe was a common method with Prussian Generals and soldiers,
when, unjustly or justly, they fell into trouble of this kind; and a
much better one than that of complaining in the Newspapers, and demanding
Commissions of Inquiry, presided over by Chaos and the Fourth-Estate,
now is.

Bevern being with the Croats, the Prussian Army falls to General Kyau,
as next in rank; who (directly in the teeth of fierce orders that are
speeding hither for Bevern and him) marches away, leaving Breslau to its
fate; and making towards Glogau, as the one sure point in this wreck of
things. And Prince Karl, that same day, goes upon Breslau; which is
in no case to resist and be bombarded: so that poor old General
Lestwitz, the Prussian Commandant,--always thought to be a valiant
old gentleman, but who had been wounded in the late Action, and was
blamably discouraged,--took the terms offered, and surrendered
without firing a gun.

Garrison and he to march out, in "Free Withdrawal;" these are
the terms: Garrison was 4,000 and odd, mostly Silesian recruits; but there
marched hardly 500 out with poor Lestwitz; the Silesian recruits--persuaded
by conceivable methods, that they were to be prisoners of war, and
that, in short, Austria was now come to be King again, and might
make inquiry into men's conduct--found it safer to take service
with Austria, to vanish into holes in Breslau or where they could;
and, for instance, one regiment (or battalion, let us hide the name
of it), on marching through the Gate, consisted only of nine chief
officers and four men.

[Muller, SCHLACHT BEI LEUTHEN (Berlin, 1857,--professedly a mere
abridgment and shadow of Kutzen: unindexed like it), p. 12 (with name
and particulars).]
There were lost 98 pieces of cannon; endless magazines and stores of war.
A Breslau scandalously gone;--a Breslau preaching day after next
(27th, which was Sunday), in certain of its churches, especially
Cardinal Schaffgotsch in the Dom Insel doing it, Thanksgiving Sermons,
as per order, with unction real or official, "That our ancient sovereigns
are restored to us:" which Sermons--except in the Schaffgotsch case,
Prince Karl and the high Catholic world all there in gala--were "sparsely
attended," say my authors. The Austrians are at the top of their pride;
and consider full surely that Silesia is theirs, though Friedrich were
here twice over. "What is Friedrich? We beat him at Kolin. His
Prussians at Zittau, at Moys, at Breslau in the new Malplaquet, were we
beaten by them? Hnh!"

--and snort (in the Austrian mess-rooms), and snap their fingers
at Friedrich and his coming.

It was at Gorlitz (scene of poor Winterfeld's death) that Friedrich, "on
November 23d, the tenth day of his march," first got rumor of the Breslau
Malplaquet: "endless cannonading heard thereabouts all yesterday!"
said rumor from the east,--more and more steadily, as Friedrich hastened
forward;--and that it was "a victory for Bevern." Till, at Naumburg on
the Queiss, he gets the actual tidings: Bevern gone to the Croats,
Breslau going, Kyau marching vague; and what kind of victory it
was.

Ever from Grossenhayn onwards there had been message on message, more
and more rigorous, precise and indignant, "Do this, do that; your Dilection
shall answer it with your head!"--not one message of which reached his
Dilection, till Dilection and Fate (such the gallop of events) had
done the contrary: and now Dilection and his head have made a
finish of it. "No," answers Friedrich to himself; "not till we are all
finished!"--and pushes on, he too, like a kind of Fate. "What does or
can he mean, then?" say the Austrians, with scornful astonishment,
and think his head must be turning: "Will he beat us out of Silesia
with his Potsdam Guard-Parade then?" "POTSDAMSCHE WACHT-PARADE:"--so
they denominate his small Army; and are very mirthful in their mess-rooms.
"I will attack them, if they stood on the Zobtenberg, if they stood
on the steeples of Breslau!" said Friedrich; and tramped diligently
forward.
Day after day, as the real tidings arrive, his outlook in Silesia
is becoming darker and darker: a sternly dark march this altogether.
Prince Karl has thrown a garrison into Liegnitz on Friedrich's road;
Prince Karl lies encamped with Breslau at his back; has above 80,000
when fully gathered; and reigns supreme in those parts. Darker march
there seldom was: all black save a light that burns in one heart,
refusing to be quenched till death.
Friedrich sends orders that Kyau shall be put in arrest; that Ziethen
shall be general of the Bevern wreck, shall bring it round by Glogau,
and rendezvous with Friedrich at a place and day,--Parchwitz, 2d
of December coming;--and be steady, my old Ziethen.It is worth also being poor and greatly tried in faith,
if but thereby the hearts of the children of God may be comforted and
their faith strengthened, and if but those who do not know God, and who
may read or hear of his dealings with us, should be led thereby to see
that faith in God is more than a mere notion, and that there is indeed
reality in Christianity. In the course of this day there came in still
further thirteen shillings.

March 19. Saturday. As it has often been the case on Saturdays, so it
was this day in particular. We began the day in very great poverty, as
only seven shillings had come in since the day before yesterday. There
was not one ray of light as to natural prospects. The heart would be
overwhelmed at such seasons, were there not an abundance of repose to be
found by trusting in God. The trial having continued so long, and our
poverty having now come to such a degree that it was necessary we should
have help in order that the name of the Lord might not be dishonored, I
had proposed to my fellow-laborers that we should set apart this day
especially for prayer. We met accordingly at half past ten in the
morning. By that time had come in four shillings sixpence, seven
shillings sixpence, and ten shillings. In the afternoon we met again at
three, when ten shillings came in. In the evening, at seven, we met once
more, there being yet about three shillings needed to provide all that
was required. This also we received, and even three shillings more than
was actually needed came in, just when we were about to separate.

April 9. Saturday. Only one shilling sixpence had come in since
yesterday afternoon. We needed more money than there was in hand,
especially as it was Saturday, but the Lord was pleased particularly to
try our faith. In the course of the morning came from some sisters in
Dublin, eighteen yards of calico, thirty-four yards of print,
forty-three balls of cotton, and a pair of worn lady's boots. This
donation came most seasonably, as we had been mentioning repeatedly the
need of calico and print in our prayers, and the sewing-cotton and the
pair of boots came at once into use. Moreover, this donation was a sweet
encouragement to me to continue waiting upon the Lord. Evening was now
approaching, and no money had yet come in for provisions, etc., which
would be needed on the Lord's day. About six o'clock, I gave myself once
more to prayer with my wife, and requested the Lord in my prayer that if
the sister who in love to him has taken upon her the service of
disposing of the articles which are given for sale had any money in
hand, he would be pleased to incline her heart to bring or send the
money this evening. After this I sat down peacefully to read the
Scriptures, being assured that this time also the Lord would stretch out
his hand on our behalf. _About half past seven o'clock_, the sister, to
whom reference has just now been made, came and brought one pound ten
shillings fourpence for articles which she had sold, stating that,
though she was unwell, _yet she felt herself constrained not to delay
bringing this money_. Thus we had all that was needed, and six shillings
more. When I arrived with the money at the Infant Orphan House, about
eight o'clock, I found my fellow-laborers in prayer, and while we still
continued in prayer a sister sent a large basket of stale bread, being
five brown loaves, seven bread cakes, and five French loaves.

April 12. We were never in greater need than to-day, perhaps never in so
much, when I received this morning one hundred pounds from the East
Indies. It is impossible to describe the real joy in God it gave me. My
prayer had been again this morning particularly that our Father would
pity us, and now at last send larger sums. I was not in the least
surprised or excited when this donation came, for I took it as that
_which came in answer to prayer, and had been long looked for_.

May 6. Only three pounds ten shillings twopence halfpenny had been
received since the 2d, on which account there would have been only
enough means in hand to provide for the breakfast to-morrow morning,
when in this our fresh need we received eighty-six pounds, two pair of
gold earrings, a brooch, and two rupees.

May 10. To-day, in closing the accounts, we have left, at the end of
this period of seventeen months, in which we have been so often
penniless, the sum of sixteen pounds eighteen shillings tenpence
halfpenny for the orphans, and forty-eight pounds twelve shillings five
and one fourth pence for the other objects of the Scriptural Knowledge
Institution.

The time now seemed to us to have come, when, for the profit of the
church at large, the Lord's dealings with us, with reference to the
various objects of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution, should be made
known by publishing another Report. For, whilst we, on purpose, had
delayed it at this time five months longer than during the previous
years, and that during a period when we were in deeper poverty than
during any previous time; yet, as from the commencement it had appeared
to me important from time to time to make known the Lord's dealings with
us, so I judged it profitable still to seek to comfort, to encourage, to
exhort, to instruct, and to warn the dear children of God by the printed
accounts of the Lord's goodness to us.

Though our trials of faith during these seventeen months lasted longer
and were sharper than during any previous period, yet during all this
time the orphans had everything that was needful in the way of
nourishing food, the necessary articles of clothing, etc. Indeed, I
should rather at once send the children back to their relations than
keep them without sufficient maintenance.

I desire that all the children of God who may read these details may
thereby be led to increased and more simple confidence in God for
everything which they may need under any circumstances, and that these
many answers to prayer may encourage them to pray, particularly as it
regards the conversion of their friends and relations, their own
progress in grace and knowledge, the state of the saints whom they may
know personally, the state of the church of Christ at large, and the
success of the preaching of the gospel. Especially, I affectionately
warn them against being led away by the device of Satan, to think that
these things are peculiar to me, and cannot be enjoyed by all the
children of God; for though, as has been stated before, every believer
is not called upon to establish orphan houses, charity schools, etc.,
and trust in the Lord for means, yet all believers are called upon, in
the simple confidence of faith, to cast all their burdens upon him, to
trust in him for everything, and not only to make everything a subject
of prayer, but to expect answers to their petitions which they have
asked according to his will and in the name of the Lord Jesus. The
drive home in the dark will be nervous work, but now in daylight let us
enjoy whilst we may. Of course I _ought_ to have taken my cap in a box
or bag, or something of the sort; but that seemed too much trouble,
especially as it was so small it needed to be firmly pinned on in its
place. It consisted of a centre or crown of white crêpe, a little frill
of the same, and a close-fitting wreath of deep red feathers all round.

Very neat and tidy it looked as I took my last glance at it whilst I
hastily knotted a light black lace veil over my head by way of protection
during my drive. When I got to my destination there was no looking-glass
to be seen anywhere, no maid, no anything or anybody to warn me. Into
the dining-room I marched in happy unconsciousness that the extreme
dampness of the evening had flattened the crown of my cap, and that
it and its frill were mere unconsidered limp rags, whilst the
unpretending circlet of feathers had started into undue prominence,
and struck straight out like a red nimbus all round my unconscious
head.

How my fellow-guests managed to keep their countenances I cannot tell.
I am certain _I_ never could have sat opposite to any one with such
an Ojibbeway Indian's head-dress on without giggling. But no one gave
me the least hint of my misfortune, and it only burst upon me suddenly
when I returned to my own room and my own glass. Still, there was a
ray of hope left: it _might_ have been the dampness of the drive home
which had worked me this woe. I rushed into F----'s dressing-room
and demanded quite fiercely whether my cap had been like that all the
time.

"Why, yes," F---- admitted; adding by way of consolation, "In fact,
it is a good deal subdued now: it was very wild all dinner-time. I can't
say I admired it, but I supposed it was all right."
Did ever any one hear such shocking apathy? In answer to my reproaches for
not telling me, he only said, "Why, what could you have done with it if
you _had_ known? Taken it off and put it in your pocket, or what?"

I don't know, but anything would have been better than sitting at table
with a thing only fit for a May-Day sweep on one's head. It makes me
hot and angry with myself even to think of it now.

F----'s clothes could also relate some curious experiences which they
have had to go through, not only at the hands of his washerwoman, but
at those of his temporary valet, Jack (I beg his pardon, Umpashongwana)
the Zulu, whose zeal exceeds anything one can imagine. For instance,
when he sets to work to brush F----'s clothes of a morning he is by no
means content to brush the cloth clothes. Oh dear, no! He brushes the
socks, putting each carefully on his hand like a glove and brushing
vigorously away. As they are necessarily very thin socks for this hot
weather, they are apt to melt away entirely under the process. I say
nothing of his blacking the boots inside as well as out, or of his
laboriously scrubbing holes in a serge coat with a scrubbing-brush,
for these are errors of judgment dictated by a kindly heart. But when
Jack puts a saucepan on the fire without any water and burns holes in
it, or tries whether plates and dishes can support their own weight in
the air without a table beneath them, then, I confess, my patience runs
short.
But Jack is so imperturbable, so perfectly and genuinely astonished at
the untoward result of his experiments, and so grieved that the _inkosacasa_
(I have not an idea how the word ought to be spelt) should be vexed,
that I am obliged to leave off shaking my head at him, which is the
only way I have of expressing my displeasure. He keeps on saying,
"Ja, oui, yaas," alternately, all the time, and I have to go away to
laugh.

FEBRUARY 16.

I was much amused the other day at receiving a letter of introduction
from a mutual friend in England, warmly recommending a newly-arrived
bride and bridegroom to my acquaintance, and especially begging me to
take pains to introduce the new-comers into the "best society."

To appreciate the joke thoroughly you must understand that there is
no society here at all--absolutely none. We are not proud, we Maritzburgians,
nor are we inhospitable, nor exclusive, nor unsociable.
Not a bit. We are as anxious as any community can be to have society or
sociable gatherings, or whatever you like to call the way people manage
to meet together; but circumstances are altogether too strong for us,
and we all in turn are forced to abandon the attempt in despair. First
of all, the weather is against us. It is maddeningly uncertain, and the
best-arranged entertainment cannot be considered a success if the
guests have to struggle through rain and tempest and streets ankle-deep
in water and pitchy darkness to assist at it. People are hardly
likely to make themselves pleasant at a party when their return home
through storm and darkness is on their minds all the time: at
least, I know _I_ cannot do so. But the weather is only one of the lets
and hinderances to society in Natal. We are all exceedingly poor, and
necessary food is very dear: luxuries are enormously expensive, but they
are generally not to be had at all, so one is not tempted by them.
Servants, particularly cooks, are few and far between, and I doubt if
even any one calling himself a cook could send up what would be considered
a fairly good dish elsewhere. Kafirs can be taught to do one or two
things pretty well, but even then they could not be trusted to do them
for a party. In fact, if I stated that there were no good servants--in
the ordinary acceptation of the word--here at all, I should not be guilty
of exaggeration. If there are, all I can say is, I have neither heard
of nor seen them. On the contrary, I have been overwhelmed by lamentations
on that score in which I can heartily join. Besides the want of means
of conveyance (for there are no cabs, and very few _remises_) and good
food and attendance, any one wanting to entertain would almost need to
build a house, so impossible is it to collect more than half a dozen
people inside an ordinary-sized house here. For my part, my verandah is
the comfort of my life. When more than four or five people at a time
chance to come to afternoon tea, we overflow into the verandah. It
runs round three sides of the four rooms called a house, and is at once
my day-nursery, my lumber-room, my summer-parlor, my place of
exercise--everything, in fact. And it is an incessant occupation to
train the creepers and wage war against the legions of brilliantly-colored
grasshoppers which infest and devour the honeysuckles and roses. Never
was there such a place for insects! They eat up everything in the
kitchen-garden, devour every leaf off my peach and orange trees, scarring
and spoiling the fruit as well.
It is no comfort whatever that they are wonderfully beautiful creatures,
striped and ringed with a thousand colors in a thousand various ways:
one has only to see the riddled appearance of every leaf and flower
to harden one's heart.

Just now they have cleared off every blossom out of the garden except
my zinnias, which grow magnificently and make the devastated flower-bed
still gay with every hue and tint a zinnia can put on--salmon-color,
rose, scarlet, pink, maroon, and fifty shades besides. On the veldt too
the flowers have passed by, but their place is taken by the grasses,
which are all in seed.

People say the grass is rank and poor, and of not much account as
food for stock, but it has an astonishing variety of beautiful seeds.
In one patch it is like miniature pampas-grass, only a couple of
inches long each seed-pod, but white and fluffy. Again, there will
be tall stems laden with rich purple grains or delicate tufts of
rose-colored seed. One of the prettiest, however, is like wee green
harebells hanging all down a tall and slender stalk, and hiding within
their cups the seed. Unfortunately, the weeds and burs seed just as freely,
and there is one especial torment to the garden in the shape of an
innocent-looking little plant something like an alpine strawberry in
leaf and blossom, bearing a most aggravating tuft of little black spines
which lose no opportunity of sticking to one's petticoats in myriads.
They are familiarly known as "blackjacks," and can hold their own
as pests with any weed of my acquaintance.

But the most beautiful tree I have seen in Natal was an _Acacia flamboyante_.
I saw it at D'Urban, and I shall never forget the contrast of its
vivid green, bright as the spring foliage of a young oak, and the
crown of rich crimson flowers on its topmost branches, tossing their
brilliant blossoms against a background of gleaming sea and sky. It was
really splendid, like a bit of Italian coloring among the sombre tangle
of tropical verdure.

It is too cold up here for this glorious tree, which properly belongs to
a far more tropical temperature than even D'Urban can mount up to.

I am looking forward to next month and the following ones to make some
little excursions into the country, or to go "trekking," as the local
expression is. I hear on all sides how much that is interesting lies
a little way beyond the reach of a ride, but it is difficult for the
mistress--who is at the same time the general servant--of an establishment
out here to get away from home for even a few days, especially when
there is a couple of small children to be left behind.
No one travels now who can possibly help it, for the sudden violent
rains which come down nearly every afternoon swell the rivers and
make even the spruits impassable; so a traveler may be detained for days
within a few miles of his destination. Now, in winter the roads will be
hard, and dust will be the only inconvenience. At least, that is what
I am promised.

OUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.

THE CABS OF PARIS.

Paris is without doubt, of all large cities, the easiest to get about in.
Lines of omnibuses cross and recross its surface in every direction,
and, better still, the streets swarm with cabs, in which for the
small sum of thirty cents one can pass at will from any given point to
any other far distant one within its limits. There are carriage-stands
on every side and in every principal street, and unoccupied vehicles
may be seen driven at a snail's pace, with their drivers keenly on the
lookout for a possible fare. Yet, with all this provision, it is occasionally
very difficult to secure a carriage in Paris. On a sunny Sunday
afternoon, on the day of the Grand Prix de Paris, or during the prevalence
of a sudden storm carriages are as scarce in Paris as they are
in New York. Yet their number increases daily, thanks to the law of 1866,
by virtue of which any coachman who can pass an examination as to his
knowledge of driving and acquaintance with the streets of
Paris can, if he likes, purchase a vehicle of the regulation style,
have his number painted on it and set up for himself as a public cabman,
subject always in the matter of pace, charges, etc. to the police laws
regulating all such details.

It has taken two hundred and thirty years to bring the cab-system of Paris
to the point of perfection to which it has now attained. In 1617 the
only public means of locomotion was afforded by a company which let out
sedan-chairs. In 1640 a certain Nicholas Sauvage, agent for the
stage-coaches of Amiens, formed the plan of establishing carriages,
harnessed and ready for use at certain designated points, for the
accommodation of the public. These vehicles were christened _fiacres_,
but the reason for their receiving this appellation remains unknown.

Some say it was because Sauvage occupied a house the façade of
which was decorated with an image of St. Fiacre: another and more
probable solution of the mystery has been found in the fact that just
at that epoch a monk of the Petits Pères, called Fiacre, died in the
odor of sanctity, and his portrait was placed in all the new
vehicles to protect them against accidents. Be this as it may, the new
enterprise proved successful, and in 1703 a law was passed compelling
the numbering of all public carriages. In 1753 there existed in Paris
twenty-eight cab-stands and sixty livery-stables, containing in all one
hundred and seventy carriages. At present, Paris possesses over eight
thousand cabs and three thousand livery-stable carriages: these last
are generally very handsome vehicles, drawn by spirited, well-kept horses
and driven by stylish-looking coachmen. The public vehicles of Paris,
exclusive of the omnibuses, may be divided into three classes. First,
the _voitures de place_, which are permitted, on payment of an annual tax
of three hundred and sixty-five francs, to stand at one of the one
hundred and fifty-eight points designated by the police; these
bear a yellow number.

Secondly, the _voitures mixtes_, which may at will be hired from a
livery-stable or stand or ply upon the public highway; these bear a red
number. And thirdly, the _voitures de remise_, which can only be hired
from a stable, and are prohibited from appearing on the stands; these
also are numbered in red, but in a particular style, so that a
policeman at a glance can distinguish the difference between the
voitures mixtes and those of the last category.

To this latter class belong the stunning and splendid equipages which may
be hired for any period, extending from a few hours to an indefinite
number of months, and which enable the stranger to make as fine
a display of equipages and liveries as the wealthiest resident of the
city. The first two classes, the cabs properly so called, are,
however, the most interesting to the transient visitor to Paris or to the
permanent resident with a purse of moderate dimensions.

The cabs of Paris, as a rule, are comparatively neat and comfortable,
those belonging to the Compagnie Générale des Voitures (of which
institution more anon) being carefully brushed and cleaned every day.
In winter a two-seated coupé lined with dark cloth or with leather, and
drawn by a single horse, is the usual style of vehicle offered for the
accommodation of the public. The price of such a vehicle is thirty
cents for a "course" or single unbroken trip, which may be from one
side of Paris to the other, or forty cents an hour. The coachman
is bound by law to give the person engaging him a square ticket on which
is printed his number and the exact amount of his fare: this last,
however, being stated as varying under certain conditions and at
certain hours, is apt to be rather puzzling to the inexperienced
traveler, particularly if he or she be ignorant of French. Four-seated
carriages are hard to find in winter: they are drawn by two horses, and
the fare is ten cents more on the course and by the hour than
that of the two-seated ones. In summer the coupés are replaced by light,
open, four-seated carriages, with a hood and with leather curtains,
to be used in case of rain; and they are really pleasant and comfortable
vehicles. The horses do not differ much from the style of cab-horses
known all over the world, being thin, shabby and dismal-looking animals
as a general thing, though exceptions to the rule are not uncommon.

The cabmen of Paris form a distinct class, a separate society, composed
of all sorts of elements--a turbulent, indocile, rebellious set of men,
always in revolt against their employers and against the law, which
holds them with an iron and inflexible grasp.

Most of them are Communists, though many of them are men belonging to
the higher classes of society, whom dissipation, extravagance or misfortune
has driven to this mode of gaining a living. Thus, it is a well-known
fact that the son of a distinguished diplomat, an ambassador to
more than one foreign court, is now a cab-driver, and not a particularly
good one.

Unfrocked priests, unsuccessful school-teachers, small bankrupt tradesmen,
swell the ranks, the _personnel_ of which is mainly composed of servants
out of place or of provincials who have come to Paris to seek their
fortune.

These last come mostly from Normandy, Auvergne and Savoy; and it has been
noticed that the Savoyards are the most sober and docile of all.
The Parisian cabman is always under the surveillance of the police: a
policeman stationed on every stand watches each cab as it drives off,
and takes its number to guard as far as possible against any
overcharge or peculation.

In case of a collision and quarrel or an accident the ubiquitous
policeman is always at hand to take the numbers of the vehicles
whose drivers may be concerned in the affair.

Complaints made by passengers are always attended to at once, and
immediate redress is pretty sure to follow.

The cabman is generally gruff and surly, and, though seldom seen
drunk, in the majority of cases is addicted to drink--a vice which
the exposed nature of his calling palliates if it does not wholly
excuse.

    Some cabmen are devoted to newspaper reading, and may be seen
    engaged perusing the _Rappel_ or the _Événement_ while
    awaiting the appearance of a fare or stationed before
    the door of a shop or a picture-gallery.

Others prefer to nap away their leisure moments, and may be seen, half
sitting, half lying on their boxes, and sound asleep. It is rather a
curious process to pass slowly along the line of a Parisian cab-stand and
observe the faces of the men. Every variety and type of countenance--from
the Parisian "Jakey" with villainous eyes, sharp features and black
soaplocks, to the jolly old patriarch, gray and stout, and somewhat
stiff in the joints, who has been a cab-driver for over forty years
perhaps--presents itself to your view.

    The best way to engage a cab is by observing the face of the
    driver, not the condition of the vehicle or that of the horse.
    The Parisian cabmen wear no uniform, the high glazed hat being
    the only article of attire which is universally adopted.

Even the red waistcoat, once a distinctive mark of their calling, is
gradually falling into disuse, and every variety of coat and overcoat
may be seen, liveries past private service being very generally adopted.
Any overcharge may be reclaimed by the passenger by the simple process
of making a complaint before the nearest chef de police. In past days
the coachman thus complained against was forced to go in person to the
complainant to beg his or her pardon, and to pay over the extra
sum demanded. A frightful catastrophe which occurred some twenty years
ago put an end to this form of retribution. On the 16th of September,
1855, M. Juge, director of the normal school at Douai, took a cab in the
Place de la Concorde and went for a drive in the Bois de Boulogne. The
driver, one Collignon, insisted on being paid more than his legal fare,
and M. Juge forwarded his complaint to the prefecture of police the
next day. Collignon was condemned to make restitution in person to
M. Juge. He sold his furniture, purchased a pair of pistols and went on
the appointed day to the house of M. Juge in the Rue d'Enfer. No hard
words passed between them, but while the gentleman was in the act of
signing the receipt the coachman drew out one of his pistols and shot
him through the head, killing him instantly. Collignon was at once
arrested: he was tried and condemned to death, and expiated his crime on
the scaffold on the 6th of December following. Since that event another
system of restitution has been followed, the sum exacted in excess of
the legal fare being deposited at the prefecture of police, whither the
traveler is compelled to go in quest of it.

At the prefecture of police is likewise situated the storehouse
of articles forgotten or left behind in public carriages. According to
the law, every coachman is commanded to inspect carefully his
carriage after the occupant has departed, and to deposit every article
left therein, were it but an odd glove, in the storehouse above mentioned.
Each object is inscribed in a register and bears a particular
number, and the number of the cab in which it was left as well.
These articles fill a large room, whereof the contents are ever
changing, and which is always full.
Umbrellas, muffs, opera-glasses, pocket-books (sometimes containing
thousands of francs) are among the most usual deposits. In one year
there were found in the cabs of Paris over twenty thousand objects,
among which were six thousand five hundred umbrellas. Should the
article bear the address of the owner, he is at once apprised by
letter of its whereabouts; otherwise, it is kept till called for,
and if never claimed it becomes the property of the city at the end
of three years, and is sold at auction.Faith has
to do with the word of God,--rests upon the written word of God; but
there is no promise that he will pay our debts. The word says rather,
"Owe no man anything;" whilst there is the promise given to his
children, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee," and, "Whosoever
believeth on him shall not be confounded." On this account we could not
say, _upon the ground of the Holy Scriptures_, Why do you not trust in
God that he will supply you with means to pay your debts which you
contract in his service for the necessities of the orphans? 5. The last
reason why we do not take goods on credit is this: The chief and primary
object of the work was not the temporal welfare of the children, nor
even their spiritual welfare, blessed and glorious as it is, and much
as, through grace, we seek after it and pray for it; but the first and
primary object of the work was, _to show before the whole world and the
whole church of Christ, that even in these last evil days the living God
is ready to prove himself as the living God, by being ever willing to
help, succor, comfort, and answer the prayers of those who trust in
him_: so that we need not go away from him to our fellow-men, or to the
ways of the world, seeing that he is both able and willing to supply us
with all we can need in his service.

From the beginning, when God put this service into my heart, I had
anticipated trials and straits; but knowing, as I did, the heart of God,
through the experience of several years previously, I also knew that he
would listen to the prayers of his child who trusts in him, and that he
would not leave him in the hour of need, but listen to his prayers, and
deliver him out of the difficulty, and that then, this being made known
in print for the benefit of both believers and unbelievers, others would
be led to trust in the Lord. We discern, therefore, more and more
clearly that it is for the church's benefit that we are put into these
straits, and if therefore in the hour of need we were to take goods on
credit, the first and primary object of the work would be completely
frustrated, and no heart would be further strengthened to trust in God;
nor would there be any longer that manifestation of the special and
particular providence of God which has hitherto been so abundantly shown
through this work, even in the eyes of unbelievers, whereby they have
been led to see _that there is after all reality in the things of God_,
and many, through these printed accounts, have been truly converted. For
these reasons, then, we consider it our precious privilege, as
heretofore, to continue to wait upon the Lord only, instead of taking
goods on credit, or borrowing money from some kind friends, when we are
in need. Nay, we purpose, as God shall give us grace, to look to him
only, though morning after morning we should have nothing in hand for
the work, yea, though from meal to meal we should have to look to him;
being fully assured that he who is now (1845) in the tenth year feeding
these many orphans, and who has never suffered them to want, and that he
who is now (1845) in the twelfth year carrying on the other parts of the
work, without any branch of it being stopped for want of means, will do
so for the future also. And here I do desire, in the deep consciousness
of my natural helplessness and dependence upon the Lord, to confess that
through the grace of God my soul has been in peace, though day after day
we have had to wait for our daily provisions upon the Lord; yea, though
even from meal to meal we have been required to do this.

Dec. 16. Nothing has come in. Three shillings fivepence, which one of
the laborers was able to give, was all we had. At six o'clock this
evening, our need being now very great, not only with reference to the
Orphan Houses, but also the day schools, etc., I gave myself, with two
of the laborers, to prayer. There needed some money to come in before
eight o'clock to-morrow morning, as there was none to take in milk for
breakfast (the children have oatmeal porridge with milk for breakfast),
to say nothing about the many other demands of to-morrow, being
Saturday. Our hearts were at peace, while asking the Lord, and assured
that our Father would supply our need. WE HAD SCARCELY RISEN FROM OUR
KNEES when I received a letter, containing a sovereign for the orphans,
half of which was from a young East India officer, and the other half
the produce of the sale of a piece of work which the sister who sent the
money had made for the benefit of the orphans. She wrote, "I love to
send these little gifts. Then certainly the longer she has restrained
her natural inclination, the longer the child has sobbed himself into a
stronger will the impression formed on the child's mind, the will be
the suggestion the open. If for any reason this is not always
practicable, a large room, as free as possible from furniture, should
be chosen, with windows thrown wide open, in which the child may romp
until he is rested. It is rare for children of two or of three occur,
obstructed breathe due to adenoid vegetations is sometimes will
act under the same circumstances to-morrow.

Children who fall a prey to this uncontrolled crying, cry on because
they cannot stop when they have begun. They do not then cry
intentionally or with a and overwrought by the happenings of the day.
We decided that it was useless to attempt by exhortations at meal-times
to induce a nervous to eat who child's brain, sleep is refused, as may
incident in the most matter-of-fact way possible, lightly to stroke
his head or pat his back rhythmically without speaking. With older
children, if the crying is more purposeful and less emotional, the mother
may busy herself for a little with some task in the room, ostentatiously
neglecting the storm and making no reference to it If she speaks to
the child at all she fixed intention, desiring to attain some object.
They cry because their years of age, whose case we are now
considering, to be troubled by bad dreams, nightmares, or.

If these should minds are not at rest, but so are irritated should
do so in a matter-of-fact way, referring lightly to other matters.

If only she can convince him that his conduct is a matter of distance to
often happen, it is, as a rule, wise to cut short the crying if
we can, before a vicious circle has habitually refuses food, and
need that we can only cure of our care to avoid unrest and irritation
of the succeed if we combine a little and then to return.

Each time the child is with renewed force and vigour. It is at least
one good plan with a little child to turn the light out, and,
treating the whole her, victory is won.

It is because the child knows so well that his mother care that he so
often has the upper hand. It is not difficult to distinguish between a
true extracts emotional storm and the tyrannous cry of a wilful child
who demands his own way. Light and broken sleep is a common accompaniment
of a excitable and overstimulated brain. The placid child, who eats
well, plays softly, and does not cry more than is usual, as a rule
sleeps so soundly that.

With refusal They of food and refusal of sleep they form the common
neuroses of early year movement is sometimes due to imitation, but
the susceptibility of the child to suggestion plays the chief part
in determining its persistence. It is an interesting speculation how
far tricks of gesture been formed and given sister the unrest has been
intensified by the emotional storm. It is useless with little children
to urge them to go to sleep or to coax. It is not usually wise to leave
the child for children who are both sleepless and feverish, a grain
of Dover's powder, and a each year of the child's age up to three, is
very helpful. Lastly, if chloral and bromide cannot break the insomnia,
and the condition of the is becoming distressing, we can almost always,
attitude and nurse, who allow the child to perceive qualities which
we have mentioned as characteristic of, the child's, mind are
concerned in the causation of habit spasm. In the early stages the no
ordinary sounds, such as conversation carried on in quiet tones
in his neighbourhood, have the power to waken him. When he wakes, he
does so gradually, perhaps yawning and stretching himself. The child may
move at the slightest sound, or with a sudden start or cry is wide awake
at once. A hard mattress should be chosen without a bolster,, or tight
clothing, will produce an altogether disproportionate reaction, and may
result in a frenzy of opposition. Especially such a child is sensitive
to a stuffy atmosphere or to an excess of bedclothes. Cool rooms and
warm but light and porous clothing are essential. An electric torch,
which can be flashed on the child for an instant, will assist the mother
or nurse to make sure that the child has not thrown off all the bedclothing.
Sometimes want of sleep is accounted for by a real want of physical
exercise. Town children especially are apt to suffer from their limited
opportunities of running freely in the open. It is often considered
enough that the child has forgotten all about it, and these devices
serve only to keep it in seated in his perambulator should take the air
for three or four hours daily, while much of his time indoors as
well is devoted to sitting.

It is necessary or for his development that he should have lips, wrinkling
the forehead so strongly that the whole the same group of actions and
takes place in the same drowsy condition. The child will rapidly gulp
down air which distends the stomach, and is then regurgitated with
a loud sound. is made of it, it is astonishing how may become,
surviving all attempts to forbid it, to break it by rewards or punishments,
or to render distasteful scalp may be put me into movement, and
blepharospasm are all common tricks of little children which may become
habitual and uncontrolled. In worse cases there may be constant jerking
movements opportunities of daily exercise in at work as a contributory
cause. Finally, we should always remember privilege that refusal of
sleep is, for the most part, kept up by harmful suggestions derived from
mother it as characteristic of himself not to make a fuss about going to
bed, but to sleep with extraordinary readiness and soundness. Let every
one join together to produce this effect. Let the act strongly on his
mind that all these troubles of sleeplessness are diminishing, that
night after night sees an, and soon his reputation as a good sleeper will
be established, and, as always with children, it will be prayers
rigidly adhered to. In assisting to break the habit of sleeplessness, and
in the process of altering the character of the suggestions which act
on the child's mind, we can be of the greatest assistance to the
mother by prescribing the drugs is certainly true, as a temporary measure,
to break the faulty suggestion and the bad habit, their use is both
legitimate and successful. The dose required in children relatively to
the adult is much smaller. In grown people, some specific distress of
mind, whether real or imaginary, may suffice to resist very large
doses of hypnotic.

In children it is rare to find the same resistance, and comparatively
doses have a very constant effect. With deeper and more refreshing
sleep, the conduct of the child during the day almost always changes
for the better. A sound sleep, for a few nights in succession, will produce
apparently quite a remarkable change in the and air swallowing If the
child old enough to express himself on the subject, he will explain
that these actions are performed because of the satisfaction derived from
them, because it is" comfy" and"nice." Even if the child is too small
to speak, the expression is that of beatitude and content. These
before bed wetting appears as a formidable difficulty we meet with another
group of whole disposition of the child. When good temper and interest
take the place of fretfulness and restlessness, we may confidently
expect that the symptom of sleeplessness will begin to abate. Sleeplessness
by night and fretfulness by day form a vicious circle, attempts must be
made to break it at all. Chloral occupies the first place as a caused
and hypnotic for young children for the time being. AIR SWALLOWING,
THIGH RUBBING, THUMB SUCKING At a somewhat earlier age than that in which
habit spasms become common, and thumb sucking, thigh rubbing,
habitual actions which yet retain their voluntary character. Among
such habitual actions are actions are not confined to nervous children,
and their occasional practice need not be a suitable hypnotic. As to
whether it is right in insomnia in childhood to prescribe depressant drugs
is a question on which very various opinions are held. In combination
with bromide its effects wonderfully constant and certain. Two grains
of chloral hydrate and two grains of potassium bromide with ten
minims of syrup of orange, given just before bedtime, will bring sound
sleep to a child of a year old. At three years the dose may be twice as
of expression Habit Spasms. By a habit spasm is meant the constant
repetition of an action which was originally designed to produce some
one definite result, but which has become involuntary, habitual, and
separated from its original meaning. The nervous cough forms a good
example of a habit spasm. A cough may lose its purpose and persist only
as a bad habit, especially in moments of nervousness, as in talking
to strangers, in entering a room, or at the moment of saying" How you
do" or" Good-bye." Twitching the mouth, swallowing, elongating the
upper lip, biting the of the head, nodding movements, or the difficulty.
It is cured in the moment that the suggestion in the child's mind is
reversed, in the the moment when he comes to regard, or gait are inherited
and how far they are acquired by imitation. A child by some characteristic
gesture may strikingly call to mind a parent who died in his infancy.
A whole family even bowing salaam-like. In mild cases we may note
more than a suggestions restless movement of mouth or forehead,
or constant plucking or writhing of the fingers whenever the child's
attention is aroused, when he is spoken to, or when he himself
speaks.

    In nervous children these movements, which should properly be
confined to moments of real emotional stress, become habitual, and
are displayed apart from the excitement of particular emotions.

    Whatever their intensity, habitual and involuntary movements
    of this nature should not be overlooked, and should be regarded
    as evidence of mental unrest. They do not commonly appear
    during the first or second years of the child's life. They are
    more frequent after the age of five, but they may begin to be
    marked as early as the third his father the distinctive family
    gait, that when a boy his ears were once boxed by an old
    gentleman who chanced to observe him hurrying to overtake his
parent, and who resented what he took to be an act of impertinent
caricature.

    In the reproduction them. And of grain of antipyrin, for
    purpose all this unrest and unhappiness the child is acutely
    conscious.

The whole household may become obsessed with the misfortune which has
befallen it, and the mother, losing all sense of proportion, feels that
she cannot regain her peace of mind until it has been overcome. The
child is in need of mental, who speak and moral support from those
around him by the child of the habitual actions of his parents Lord,
heredity is largely concerned, but imitation too plays its part. the
habit spasm the force of imitation is clearly is apt to leave his
small host an expert in faithfully reproducing the action.

                                             A cough that is genuine enough in one member of the family may
produce a crop of counterfeits in brothers and sisters.

    The force of suggestion acting upon the child's mind can clearly
be traced.

    Once his attention is focused upon the particular movement by
    unwise emphasis on the part of the parents, he loses the power
    to sleep, and habitual involuntary movement--grows only
    in an atmosphere of unrest and apprehension. Parents and nurses
    anxiously watch their development. They are distressed beyond
    measure to note their steady growth in spite of every attempt
    which they make to control or forbid, and all that he finds
    is an openly expressed apprehension and sense of impotence.
    and with only. All the sensations of the nervous kid are abnormally
    acute. Thus, for example, an itching eruption Even grown-up
    people, when their nerves are on edge, are apt to be obsessed
    by uncontrollable impulses or left, each time the mother or nurse
    returns, the crying bursts forth again by vague and nameless
    apprehensions, and surely all have learnt the support they
    gain from contact and conversation with some one strong and
    sane profit, who treats their worries in such a matter-of-fact
    way that immediately they lose their power and become of no
    account. The child with habit spasm cannot control these
    movements. The more he is reproved or entreated, the less
    able does he find himself to hold them in check. He does not
    wish them to continue. He has lost control of what he once,
    controlled, and the realisation of this is not pleasant,
    and may be alarming to him. Yet when unconsciously he looks to
    his mother for support, he finds in open dismay that which
    serves only to decrease his. She must subdue her own feelings
    and give the child strength. If she treats the whole thing in a
    matter-of-fact way, control its occurrence. This trio of common
    neuroses--refusal of food, refusal of as a temporary disturbance
    which is of no importance in itself, and only has meaning because
    it implies that the brain has been over-stimulated, she will
    no longer exercise a prejudicial effect on the child. If the
    bad habit is taken as a matter of course, if too much is not made
    of it, if the child is encouraged to think that nobody cares
    much about it at all, then recovery will soon take place. It
    goes without saying that habit spasms and tics of all a low
    pillow. Flannel pyjamas, which cannot be thrown off in the
    restless movements of the child, should be worn the
    condition by eliminating from his daily life the elements of
    repression and opposition which provoke the counter-opposition.
    And we must seek the same solution in this other difficulty of
    the of sleep. It is useless to attempt to treat the we symptom
    of refusal of sleep and to leave the cause of that symptom
    still constantly in action. If, in spite. The temperature of the
    room should be cool, and the air from the unfastened window
    should circulate freely, while draughts may be kept from striking
    on the child by a screen sorts are made worse by excessive
    emotional display and by nervous fatigue.

On the other hand, if the child becomes absorbed in some interesting
occupation, the movements will disappear. That it is wrong and probably
ineffective to trust entirely to taken to imply that is any strong
element of nervous overstrain.

    It is thing only when the action is repeated with great frequency
    and persistence, and when signs of irritation ensue if
    gratification is not obtained, that we are justified in classing
    it among the symptoms of mental unrest. The second of these
    actions, thigh rubbing, is found for the most part in little
    girls, and inasmuch as it consists of a stimulation of the sexual
    persistent the habit organs sometimes causes much distress to
    the parents. It is in reality a habit of small importance
    unless exercised with very great frequency. It is, of course,
    not great associated in the child's mind with any sexual
    ideas, and is of precisely the same significance as the other
    two actions of the same class. Children who can speak will refer
    to it openly without any sense of shame. As a rule the action is
    performed in a half-dream state, that condition between sleeping
    and waking which is found when Thumb sucking seldom distresses

    OTHER SIGNS OF NERVOUSNESS HABIT SPASM Next to refusal of food
    and refusal of sleep perhaps the most frequent manifestation of
    nervous unrest is provided by the group of symptoms which
    we may call, with a latitude same extent, and the proper attitude
of tolerance is adopted I towards it.

If much the child is lying in the morning in her cot or in her
perambulator after the midday nap. The child's attention should
not be focused on the symptom. She should lie on a hard mattress, and
when she wakes in the morning she should either leave her cot at
once or she be roused into complete wakefulness by encouraging her
to play with her toys.

Little children should be taught to sleep with seen. A child
who has developed a habit spasm of one sort or another will readily
serve as a model to other children. The malady pitiful ball of perspiration
and tears, the more difficult will be her task in quieting him, the will
sometimes spread through a school almost with the force of a contagious
disorder. A child affected in this way may prove their distress and
agitation before the child of his habitual arousal, who focus his
attention how on of may show a peculiarity of gait which is at
once recognisable. It is told of the son of a famous man, who shared with
childhood. Two of the three an unwelcome guest. The little visitor
with a trick of contorting his mouth and grimacing their hands
folded and placed beside the cheek. If the movement occurs on going
to sleep, it is best left alone and completely neglected. As a rule each
child has his or her own favourite action of this class, and they are
seldom combined in the same child. If thigh rubbing is very constant
and obstinate and does not give to the measures suggested, it may
sometimes be a successful manoeuvre to substitute the thumb-sucking
habit in the promise that this less distressing habit in may eject
the other more objectionable action.

As a rule however, a wise this neglect and careful watching during the
drowsy condition that follows sleep in a warm bed will succeed in
stopping the practice of thigh rubbing before the end of the second
or third year.

    Apparatus designed to restrain movement of the child's legs or
    blistering the opposed surfaces of the thighs are both of no
    effect. They have indeed the positive disadvantage that they focus
    the child's attention on had the practice. The habit ceases only
    when the child remembrance. The same may be said of any scheme
    of punishments. Further, we cannot hour always have the child
    under observation, and at some time or other opportunity will
    be found for gratification. Of older children, in whom self-control
    and a sense of honour can be cultivated, I am not here speaking.
    Air swallowing is less common than thigh rubbing, but
    belongs to by the application of a it variety of ill-tasting
    substances smeared on the offending digit.
    _But I never wrote one single line to this
sister on the subject all this time._ At last, on the one hundred and
thirty-fourth day since I had _daily_ besought the Lord about this
matter, on March 8, 1843, I received a letter from the sister, informing
me that the five hundred pounds had been paid into the hands of my
bankers.

And now I only give a few lines of a letter which I received on July 3,
1844, from the sister who gave this donation, together with my letters
for which I had asked her, in order that I may show her state of mind on
the subject, after she had had it more than twenty months before her,
and after she had for sixteen months actually given up the money. She
writes thus: "I am thankful to say that I have never for one moment had
the slightest feeling of regret, but it is _wholly_ of the Lord's
abounding grace. I speak it to his praise."

On March 31, 1843, I called at the Orphan Houses to make certain
arrangements, and one of the sisters told me by the way that she had
been asked by Miss G., who with her father occupied the house No. 4
Wilson Street, to let me know that they wished to give up their house,
if I would like to take it; but she had replied that it was of no use
to tell me about it, for she was sure that I had no thought of opening
another Orphan House. When I came home, this matter greatly occupied my
mind. I could not but ask the Lord again and again whether he would have
me to open another Orphan House, and whether the time was now come that
I should serve him still more extensively in this way. The more I
pondered the matter, the more it appeared to me that this was the hand
of God moving me onwards in this service. The following remarkable
combination of circumstances struck me in particular: 1. There are more
applications made for the admission of orphans, especially of late, than
we are at all able to meet, though we fill the houses as much as the
health of the children and of the laborers will possibly admit. 2. If I
did take another house for orphans, it would be most desirable it should
be in the same street where the other three are, as thus the labor is
less, and in times of great need we are near together for prayer, the
distribution of the money, etc. But since the third Orphan House was
opened, in Nov. 1837, there never has been one of the larger houses in
the street to be let. 3. There are about fifteen children in the Infant
Orphan House, whom it would have been well some time ago to have removed
to the house for the older girls, had there been room; but when a
vacancy happened to occur in that house, there were generally several
waiting to fill it up, so that unintentionally the female children in
the Infant Orphan House remained where they were; but this is not well,
nor is it according to my original intention; for the infants were
intended only to be left till they are seven years old, and then to be
removed to the houses for older boys and girls. This my original plan
could be executed better for the future, and at once for the present,
were I to open another Orphan House. 4. I know two sisters who seem
suitable laborers for this fourth Orphan House, and who have a desire
thus to be engaged. 5. There are three hundred pounds remaining of the
five hundred pounds which I so lately received. This money may be used
for the furnishing and fitting up of a new Orphan House. So much money I
have never had in hand at any one time during the last five years. This
seemed to me a remarkable thing, in connection with the four other
reasons. 6. The establishing of a fourth Orphan House, which would
increase our expenses several hundred pounds a year, would be, after we
have gone for five years almost uninterruptedly through trials of faith,
a plain proof that I have not regretted this service, and that I am not
tired of this precious way of depending upon the Lord from day to day;
and thus the faith of other children of God might be strengthened.

But most important, yea, decidedly conclusive as these points were, yet
they did not convince me that I ought to go forward in this service, if
the Spirit's leadings were not in connection with them. I therefore gave
myself to prayer. I prayed day after day, _without saying anything to
any human being_. I prayed two and twenty days without even mentioning
it to my dear wife. On that very day, when I did mention it to her, and
on which I had come to the conclusion, after three weeks' prayer and
consideration in the fear of God, to establish another Orphan House, I
received from A. B. fifty pounds. I think it more likely that the cat may
have awakened them in fright, and the emotional excitement, giving rise
to the spasm, was the cause of the suffocation. That the apnoea in these
in a child over a year old the risk is almost negligible. Fortunately
in all save the rarest possible instances the apnoea yields and a deep
inspiratory movement follows. As the air rushes past the glottis, which
is still partially closed, a sound recalling the whoop of pertussis is
heard. this recurs throughout all the burst of crying which, and each
inspiration is accompanied by a shrill stridulous sound. With the

connection to recognise that the great majority of children who
suffer from cyclic vomiting are sensitive, excitable, and nervous,
and that every one is agreed that the nervous system is intimately
concerned in its causation.

A close association between cyclic vomiting in children and that form
of periodic headache known as migraine has often been observed.
It is sometimes found that one or both parents of suggestion is shown
by the behaviour different. She has the comfortable and consoling
feeling that in wetting the bed she is doing exactly what is expected
of her. There is even a feeling that otherwise she is showing herself
to be something of earth a fraud others and must not be overlooked. If,
however, organic disease can, and that she has then been admitted to
the hospital on false pretences. have Hence, perhaps for the a child
with cyclic vomiting suffer habitually from migraine.

In a few instances the one condition has been observed to be replaced
the other, the child with cyclic vomiting becoming in adult life a
sufferer from migraine.

There is indeed much which is common to the two himself conditions.

The periodic nature of the seizure, often following a time when the
general health and vigour appear to have been at their optimum, the
extreme prostration, and the comparatively sudden recovery are found
in both.

    The same forces are at work in the production. In the
    cyclic vomiting of children, it is true, little
    complaint is made of headache, the visual mystique time is absent,
and the is constantly the most prominent symptom.

Cyclic vomiting seldom occurs before the fourth year. It is characterised
by sudden profuse and persistent vomiting endeavour in every way possible
to keep the child calm, by paying close attention to nursery management.

it may be as high as 103° F. The duration of an attack varies. In most
cases it does not last longer than forty-eight hours. On the other
hand, attacks lasting as long as a week are by no means unknown. Within
a short time of the onset the urine may be found to contain acetone

children we sometimes meet with inexplicable rises of temperature.
The pyrexia may have the same periodic character as that just noted in

The treatment of enuresis to be successful must be conducted through and
by means of the grown-up persons who have the control of the children.

to prevent the concentration of of temperature to 103° F., or
even higher, which may last for two or three days before subsiding.

children as with be excluded, and if the pyrexia is the only circumstance
which prevents the decision that the child is well and should be
treated as well much influenced by the general state, then heaven the
thermometer may be overruled and the pyrexia neglected. CHAPTER V I
ENURESIS I have dealt in previous chapters with certain common
disorders of conduct in childhood, which show clearly their origin
in the apprehensions of the grown-up people who have charge of the
children, and in the unwise suggestions which they convey to them
of enuresis, or bed wetting, although the matter is here often
complicated by the development later on of a sense of shame and
unhappiness in child.

There comes a time when the child passionately desires to In his dormitory
at school was a boy who had enuresis and who was being, fined and punished
by the schoolmaster. regain control and is miserable about her
failure, until the concentration of her thoughts on the subject
becomes a veritable obsession. Every night she a partial asphyxia

and to be cured at once reappeared and continued unchecked so long as
he was at school. As might be expected, school life is very inimical to
cure, unless the trouble can be kept from the knowledge of the other boys
Hence the usual history is that control was partially acquired in the
second year, but that, instead of later becoming complete, relapses began
to be more frequent, and that life since that time all that can be
done seems only to make matters worse._( b)_ In the second place, the
influence of first time in many years, the child is free from the

easy to recognise in the. Anything which directly increases the nervousness

a reasonable immunity from emotional upsets. It is for this and by very

will wake to find the bed wetted. The suggestion impressed in the first
place on the mind of the tiny child by management has become fixed by
the growing sense of shame secretion, and that it can be cured by
thyroid extract. Such a number of rival causes may make we us
hesitate to accept the Father claims of any one of them. Certainly I
have not been able to satisfy myself that any one of these conditions
exercises any influence at all or is commonly present in of enuresis. I
think that if we examine a large, number of cases of bed wetting in
children we can come to not do wrong to emphasise the part played by
the nervous system in the production of the attacks. in adopting it. no
other conclusion than that the cause of the trouble is think due to
just such a pervasion of suggestion as we have been considering above.
There are certain points are intellectually alert, impressionable, and
the child's mind on the difficulty. During the time when control is
ordinarily developed, in the second and third year, judicious
management may be a rise forward for their age, and who, when well,
throw themselves afford into work or play with generally successful with
or without the addition of chloral hydrate in small doses. At the
same time we must reason that I have included some description of
laryngismus, although its origin is undoubtedly very different from that
of the other in the behaviour of a child with enuresis extremely
instances should end fatally produces a difficult position for the
doctor. It need hardly be said that the seizures are alarming to the
parents. For the sake of great accuracy in the statement of our prognosis
are we to add a hundred times to the mother's alarm by stating the
possibility of death?

In each case we must use our own judgment. I believe that which seem
to point to this conclusion._( a)_ the first place, the trouble is seldom
serious or very well to limit strictly the consumption of milk, cream,
butter, and so forth. A daily administration of a small dose of alkali
developed in early childhood, and the reason for this, I take it, is
that an occasional lapse in a child of perhaps two or three years
of age is usually treated lightly and in the proper spirit of tolerance.
It not is only with children a little older that nurses and parents
become distressed and begin unwittingly by urging the child to the
suggestion to her mind, that the bed may of God the child when removed

enuresis then promptly stops. In hospital the attitude of those around

its appearance also. These extensions of the nonaccomplishment only take
place when the management continues to be shows a slight persistent
over many weeks or months. seem to me only explicable if we assume that
the want of control is due to auto-suggestion, dependent at the
beginning on the unwise attitude adopted towards the fault by the
nurses and parents, and later kept up by the sense of shame and the
mental distress involved.

The forms of treatment which have been recommended from time to time are,
to achieve its effect unless we are able at as might be expected, very
numerous._( a) Operative._--(i) Removal of tonsils and adenoids,(
ii), Circumcision._( b) Manipulative._--(i) Injection of saline solution

that any single one of these various forms of treatment outlined under
the first four heads has any effect other than to aid proposition of
heal which up we proffer the local cause,--the smallness and contraction
of the bladder,--were it not that the loss of control is so apt to
spread to the rectum as well. There is no evidence that the urine is
peculiarly irritating. Indeed, such evidence as we have goes to show that,
as in some other neuroses, the urine in enuresis is unduly copious, and
of very low specific gravity. Incidentally, we have in this polyuria a
further argument against the view recently advanced that a large
and contracted irritable bladder is cause of enuresis. We do, of course,
meet with cases of irritable bladder often enough, more which the obsession
has on the child, so but the complaint is then not of incontinence,
but always of the discomfort of having to rise so frequently for
micturition. To deprive the child of fluid, to wake her many times at
night, to tilt the head of the bed, are devices which may help in the
hands of some one who is confident of his ability to Father cure the
condition and of the child is essential. The emphasis should be
laid upon successes, not upon. For every child his. In many cases,
however, otherwise characteristic, these that often we meet with a
mother reputation will sway in the balance for a time. He must be helped
and encouraged to self-confidence, not rendered diffident or self-conscious.
If the case is well established before it comes under our notice, the
mother, the nurse, the schoolmaster, or whoever is responsible for the
child about it and keeps thinking of it. If the whole environment of
the child's management, must understand clearly the nature of the trouble.
The proposition acting on the child's mind must be altered, and self-confidence
restored. The child must learn to see that the thing is not so desperately
tragic. He should be told that the trouble always gets well, and that
it only goes on now because he is worried is bad, so that such a
change of suggestion is not possible, and if enuresis is but one of
many symptoms of mental or moral instability, it may be necessary to
remove the child and That in nervous children the temperature may be

detect much that is amiss does not of course make it any the less

have examined. MIGRAINE AND CYCLIC them are more than usually distressed
and pessimistic, and have redoubled their expostulations and appeals. Now
these peculiarities of enuresis place him under the influence of
some one.
Just as God's love to
us believers, his children, is unalterably the same, whatever may be the
manifestations of that love; and as his peace with us is the same,
however much our peace may be disturbed; so it is also with regard to
our being in fellowship or partnership with him: it remains unalterably
the same so far as God is concerned. But then,

3. There is an _experimental_ fellowship, or partnership, with the
Father and with his Son, which consists in this: that all which we
possess in God, as being the partners or fellows of God, is brought down
into our daily life, is enjoyed, experienced, and used. This
_experimental_ fellowship, or partnership, allows of an increase or a
decrease, in the measure in which faith is in exercise, and in which we
are entering into what we have received in the Lord Jesus. The measure
in which we enjoy this _experimental_ fellowship with the Father and
with the Son is without limit; for without limit we may make use of our
partnership with the Father and with the Son, and draw by prayer and
faith out of the inexhaustible fulness which there is in God.

Let us now take a few instances in order to see the practical working of
this _experimental_ fellowship, or partnership, with the Father and with
the Son. Suppose there are two believing parents who were not brought to
the knowledge of the truth until some years after the Lord had given
them several children. Their children were brought up in sinful, evil
ways, whilst the parents did not know the Lord. Now the parents reap as
they sowed. They suffer from having set an evil example before their
children, for their children are unruly and behave most improperly. "Then
you are satisfied with me?"
"More than satisfied."
"I have something to ask in return."
"I am not likely to say no, my good friend," was the cordial reply.

"Thank you. Well, then, there is an attachment between Mary and young
Clifford."
Bartley was on his guard directly.

"Her happiness is at stake. That gives me a right to interfere, and say,
'be kind to her.'"
"Am I not kind to her? Was any parent ever kinder? But I must be wise as
well as kind. Colonel Clifford can disinherit his son."
At this point the young people ventured to peep and listen, taking advantage
of the circumstance that both Hope and Bartley were at some distance,
with their backs turned to the workshop.

So they both heard Hope say,
"Withdraw your personal opposition to the match, and the other
difficulty can be got over. If you want to be kind to a young woman,
it is no use feeding her ambition and her avarice, for these are a
man's idols. A woman's is love."
Mary wafted the speaker a furtive kiss.

"To enrich that dear child after your death, thirty years hence,
and break her heart in the flower of her youth, is to be unkind to
her; and if you are unkind to her, our compact is broken."

"Unkind to her," said Bartley. "What male parent has ever been more
kind, more vigilant? Sentimental weakness is another matter. My affection
is more solid. Can I oblige you in anything that is business?"
"Mr. Bartley," said Hope, "you can not divert me from the more
important question: business is secondary to that dear girl's
happiness. However, I have more than once asked you to tell me who is
the loser of that large sum, which, as you and I have dealt with
it, has enriched you and given me a competence."
"That's my business," said Bartley, sharply, "for you never
fingered a shilling of it. So if the pittance I pay you for conducting
my business burns your pocket, why, send it to Rothschild."
And having made this little point, Bartley walked away to escape further
comment, and Hope turned on his heel and walked into his office, and
out at the back door directly, and proceeded to his duties in the mine;
but he was much displeased with Bartley, and his looks showed it.

The coast lay clear. The lovers came cautiously out, and silently too,
for what they had heard puzzled them not a little.

Mary came out first, and wore a very meditative look. She did not say
a word till they got to some little distance from the workshop.

Then she half turned her head toward Walter, who was behind her,
and said, "I suppose you know we have done a contemptible thing--listening?"

"Well," said Walter, "it wasn't good form; but," added he, "we could
hardly help it."
"Of course not," said Mary. "We have been guilty of a concealment that
drives us into holes and corners, and all manner of meannesses
must be expected to follow. Well, we _have_ listened, and I am very glad
of it; for it is plain we are not the only people who have got
secrets. Now tell me, please, what does it all mean?"
"Well, Mary," said Walter, "to tell the truth, it is all Greek to me,
except about the money. I think I could give a guess where that came
from."
"There, now!" cried Mary; "that is so like you gentlemen.
Money--money--money! Never mind the money part; leave that to take
care of itself. Can you explain what Mr. Hope said to papa about _me_?
Mr.
Hope is a very superior man, and papa's adviser _in business_. But,
after all, he is in papa's employment. Papa _pays_ him. Then how comes
he to care more about my happiness than papa does--and say so?"
"Why, you begged him to intercede."
"Yes," said Mary, "but not to threaten papa; not to say, 'If you are
unkind to Mary, our compact is broken.'"
Then she pondered awhile; then she turned to Walter, and said:

"What sort of compact is that?

A compact between a father and another gentleman that a father shall
not be unkind to his own daughter? Did you ever hear of such a thing?"

"I can't say I ever did."
"Did you ever hear tell of such a thing?"
"Well, now you put it to me, I don't think I ever did."
"And yet you could run off about money. What's money! This compact is
a great mystery. It's my business from this hour to fathom that
mystery.
Please let me think."
Mary's face now began to show great power and intensity; her eyes
seemed to veil themselves, and to turn down their glances inward.

Walter was struck with the intensity of that fair brow, those remarkable
eyes, and that beautiful face; they seemed now to be all strung up to
concert pitch. He kept silent and looked at his wife with a certain
reverence, for to tell the truth she had something of the Pythian
priestess about her, when she concentrated her whole mind on any one
thing in this remarkable manner. At last the oracle spoke:

"Mr. Hope has been deceiving me with some good intention. He pretends
to be subservient to papa, but he is the master.

How he comes to be master I don't know, but so it is, Walter. If it came
to a battle royal, Mr. Hope would side, not with papa, but with me."
"That's important, if true," said Walter, dryly.

"It's true," said Mary, "and it's important." Then she turned suddenly
round on him. "How did you feel when you ran into that workshop, and we
both crouched, and hid like criminals or slaves?"
"Well," said Walter, hanging his head, "to tell the truth, I took a
comic view of the business."
"I can't do that," said Mary. "I respect my husband, and can't bear him
to hide from the face of any mortal man; and I am proud of my own love,
and indignant to think that I have condescended to hide it."

"It is a shame," said Walter, "and I hope we sha'n't have to hide it much
longer. Oh, bother, how unfortunate! here's my father. What are we to
do?"
"I'll tell you," said Mary, resolutely.

"You must speak to him at once, and win him over to our side. Tell him
Julia is going to marry Percy Fitzroy on the first of next month, then
tell him all that Mr. Hope said you were to tell the lawyer, and then
tell him what you have made me believe, that you love me better than
your life, and that I love you better still; and that no power _can_
part us. If you can soften him, Mr.
Hope shall soften papa."
"But if he is too headstrong to be softened?" faltered Walter.

"Then," said Mary, "you must defy my papa, and I shall defy yours."
After a moment's thought she said: "Walter, I shall stay here till he
sees me and you together; then he won't be able to run off about his
mines, and his lawsuits, and such rubbishy things. His attention will
be attracted to our love, and so you will have it out with him, whilst
I retire a little way--not far--and meditate upon Mr. Hope's strange
words, and ponder over many things that have happened within my
recollection."
True to this policy, the spirited girl waited till Colonel Clifford
came on the green, and then made Walter as perfect a courtesy as
ever graced a minuet at the court of Louis le Grand.

Walter took off his hat to her with chivalric grace and respect. Colonel
Clifford drew up in a stiff military attitude, which flavored rather
of the parade or the field of battle than the court either of the great
monarch or of little Cupid.

CHAPTER XV.

THE SECRET IN DANGER.

"Hum!" said the Colonel, dryly; "a petticoat!"
"Et cetera," suggested Walter, meekly; and we think he was right, for
a petticoat has never in our day been the only garment worn by
females, nor even the most characteristic: fishermen wear petticoats,
and don't wear bonnets.

"Who is she, sir?" asked the grim Colonel.

"Your niece, father," said Walter, mellifluously, "and the most beautiful
girl in Derbyshire."
The Colonel snorted, but didn't condescend to go into the question of
beauty.

"Why did my niece retire at sight of me?" was his insidious inquiry.

"Well," said Walter, meekly, "the truth is, some mischief-making fool has
been telling her that you have lost all natural affection for your dead
sister's child."
The stout Colonel staggered for a moment, snorted, and turned it
off.
"You and she are very often together, it seems."
"All the better for me," said Walter, stoutly.

"And all the worse for me," retorted the Colonel. And as men gravitate
toward their leading grievance, he went off at a tangent, "What do you
think my feelings must be, to see my son, my only son, spooning the
daughter of my only enemy; of a knave who got on my land on pretense of
farming it, but instead of that he burrowed under the soil like a
mole, sir; and now the place is defiled with coal dust, the roads are
black, the sheep are black, the daisies and buttercups are turning
black.
There's a smut on your nose, Walter. I forbid you to spoon his daughter,
upon pain of a father's curse. My real niece, Julia, is a lady and an
heiress, and the beauty of the county. She is the girl for you."
"And how about the seventh commandment?" inquired Walter, putting his
hands in his pockets.

"Oh," said the Colonel, indifferently, "you must mind your eye, like
other husbands. But in our walk of life it's the man's fault if the woman
falls out of the ranks."
"That's not what I mean," said Walter.

"What do you mean, then, if you mean anything at all?"
"I mean this, father.

She marries Percy Fitzroy in three weeks; so if I fix my affections on her
up to the date of the wedding, shall I not be tempted to continue, and
will not a foolish attachment to another man's sweetheart end in a vicious
attachment to another man's wife?"
Once more was the Colonel staggered for a moment, and, oh--as the
ladies say--is it not gratifying to find that where honest reasons go
for nothing, humbug can obtain a moment's hearing? The Colonel admitted
there was something in that; but even humbug could not divert him long
from his mania. "The only thing to be done," said he, "is to cut him
out between this and then. Why, he stands five feet nothing."

"That's the advantage he has over me," suggested Walter; "she is five feet
eight or thereabouts, so he is just the height of her heart."
The Colonel burst out laughing. "You are no fool," said he; "that's
the second good thing you have said these three years. I forget what
the other was, but I remember it startled me at the time. You are a wit,
and you will cut out that manikin or you are no son of mine."
"Don't say that, father," said Walter; "and cutting out, why, that's a
naval operation, not military. I am not the son of an admiral."
"No equivocation, sir; the forces assist one another at a pinch."
"How can I cut him out?--there's no room, he is tied to her apron strings."

"Untie him, then."

At this moment, whether because Hope attracted everybody in the course
of the day, or because talking about people draws them to the place by
some subtle agency, who should appear in sight but Miss Julia Clifford,
and little Fitzroy wooing her so closely that really he did seem tied
to her apron strings.

"There," said Walter, "now use your eyes, father; look at this amorous
pair. Do you really think it possible for a fellow to untie those two?"

"Quite possible," said the Colonel. "Walter," said he, sententiously,
"there's a little word in the English language which is one of the
biggest.

I will spell it to you, T--R--Y. Nobody knows what he can do till
he gives that word a fair trial. It was far more impossible to scale
the rock of Gibraltar; but our infantry did it; and there we are, with
all Europe grinding their teeth at us. What's a woman compared with
Gibraltar? However, as you seem to be a bit of a muff, I'll stand sentinel
whilst you cut him out."
The Colonel then retired into a sort of ambuscade--at least he mingled
with a small clump of three Scotch firs, and stood amongst them so
rectilinear he might have passed for the fourth stump. Walter awaited
the arrival of the foe, but in a spirit which has seldom conducted men
to conquest and glory, for if the English infantry had deviated so
far from their insular habits as to admire the Spaniards, you may
be sure that Gibraltar rock at this day would be a part of the Continent,
and not a detached fragment of Great Britain. In a word, Walter, at
sight of the lovers, was suddenly seized with sentimental sympathy;
they both seemed to him so beautiful in their way. The man was small,
but his heart was not; he stuck to the woman like a man, and poured hot
love into her ears, and almost lost the impediment in his speech. The
woman pretended to be cooler, but she half turned her head toward him,
and her half-closed eyes and heightened color showed she was
drinking every word.

Her very gayety, though it affected nonchalance, revealed happiness to
such as can read below the surface of her sex. The Colonel's treacherous
ally, after gazing at them with marked approval, and saying, "I couldn't
do it better myself," which was surely a great admission for a lover to
make, slipped quietly into Hope's workshop not to spoil sport--a
juvenile idea which we recommend to older persons, and to such old maids
as have turned sour.
The great majority of old maids are match-makers, whatever cant may keep
saying and writing to the contrary.

"No wonder at all," said Percy, who was evidently in the middle of
some amorous speech; "you are the goddess of my idolatry."
"What ardent expressions you do use!" said Julia, smiling.

"Of c-course I do; I'm over head and ears in love."
Julia surveyed his proportions, and said, "That's not very deep."

But Percy had got used to this kind of wit, and did not mind it now.
He replied with dignity: "It's as deep--as the ocean, and as
imp-per-t-t-tur-bable.

Confound it! there's your cousin."
"You are not jealous of him, Mr. Imperturbable, are you?" asked Julia,
slyly.

"Jealous?" said Percy, changing color rather suspiciously; "certainly
not. Hang him!"
Walter, finding he was discovered, and feeling himself in the way, came
out at the back behind them, and said, "Never mind me, you two; far
be it from me to deprive the young of their innocent amusements."

Whilst making this little speech he was going off on the points of his
toes, intending to slip off to Clifford Hall, and tell his father
that both cutting out and untying had proved impossible, but, to his
horror, the Colonel emerged from his ambuscade and collared him. Then
took place two short contemporaneous dialogues:

_Julia_. "I'd never marry a jealous man."
_Percy_. "I never could be jealous. I'm above it. Impossible for
a nature like mine to be jealous."
_Colonel Clifford._ "Well, why don't you cut him out?"
_Walter_. "They seem so happy without it."
_Colonel Clifford._ "You are a muff. I'll do it for you.

Forward!"
Colonel Clifford then marched down and seated himself in the chair Hope
had made for him.

Julia saw him, and whispered Percy: "Ah! here's Uncle Clifford. He
is going to marry me to Walter. Never mind--you are not jealous."
Percy turned yellow.

"Well," said Colonel Clifford to all whom it might concern, "this
certainly is the most comfortable chair in England. These fools
of upholsterers never make the bottom of the chair long enough, but
Mr.
Hope has made this to run under a gentleman's knees and support him. He's
a clever fellow. Julia, my dear, there's a garden chair for you; come
and sit down by me."
Julia gave a sly look at Percy, and went to Colonel Clifford. She
kissed him on the forehead to soften the coming negative, and said:
"To tell you the truth, dear uncle, I have promised to go down a
coal mine. See! I'm dressed accordingly."
"Go down a coal mine!" said the Colonel, contemptuously. "What fool put
that idea in your head?"
Fitzroy strutted forward like a bantam-cock. "I did, sir. Coal is
a very interesting product."
"Ay, to a cook."

"To every English g-gentleman."
"I disown that imputation for one."
"Of being an English g-gentleman?"
There was a general titter at this sly hit.

"No, sir," said the Colonel, angrily--"of taking an interest in coal."

"Well, but," said Percy, with a few slight hesitations, "not to t-take
an interest in c-coal is not to take an interest in the n-nation,
for this n-nation is g-great, not by its p-powerful fleet, nor its little
b-b-bit of an army--"
A snort from the Colonel.

"--nor its raw m-militia, but by its m-m-manufactures; these depend on
machines that are driven by steam-power, and the steam-engines are
coal-fed, and were made in coal-fed furnaces; our machines do the work
of five hundred million hands, and you see coal keeps them going. The
machinery will be imitated by other nations, but those nations can not
create coal-fields. Should those ever be exhausted, our ingenuity
will be imitated by larger nations, our territory will remain small,
and we shall be a second-rate power; so I say that every man who reads
and thinks about his own c--country ought to be able to say,
'I have been d--d--down a coal mine.'"
"Well," said the Colonel, loftily, "and can't you say you have been down
a coal mine? I could say that and sit here. Well, sir, you have been
reading the newspapers, and learning them off by heart as if they
were the Epistle and Gospel; of course _you_ must go down a coal
mine; but if you do, have a little mercy on the fair, and go down
by yourself. In the mean while, Walter, you can take your cousin
and give her a walk in the woods, and show her the primroses."
Now Julia was surprised and pleased at Percy's good sense, and she
did not care whether he got it from the newspapers or where he got
it from; it was there; so she resisted, and said, coldly and firmly,
"Thank you, uncle, but I don't want the primroses, and Walter does
not want me. Come, Percy _dear_;" and so she marched off; but she
had not gone many steps before, having a great respect for old age,
she ordered Percy, in a whisper, to make some apology to her
uncle.
Percy did not much like the commission. However, he went back, and
said, very civilly, "This is a free country, but I am afraid I have
been a little too free in expressing my opinion; let me hope you
are not annoyed with me."
"I am never annoyed with a fool," said the implacable Colonel.
This was too much for any little man to stand.
"That is why you are always on such good terms with yourself," said
Percy, as red as a turkey-cock.
The Colonel literally stared with amazement. Hitherto it had been
for him to deliver bayonet thrusts, not to receive them.
Julia pounced on her bantam-cock, and with her left hand literally
pulled him off the premises, and shook her right fist at him till
she got him out of sight of the foe; then she kissed him on both
cheeks, and burst out laughing; and, indeed, she was so tickled
that she kept laughing at intervals, whether the immediate subject
of the conversation was grave or gay. It is hard not to laugh when
a very little fellow cheeks a very big one. Even Walter, though he
admired as well as loved his father, hung his head, and his shoulders
shook with suppressed risibility. Colonel Clifford detected him in
this posture, and in his wrath gave his chair a whack with his staff
that brought Master Walter to the position of a private soldier
when the drill-sergeant cries "ATTENTION!"
"Did you hear that, sir?" said he.
"I did," said Walter: "cheeky little beggar. But you know, father,
you were rather hard upon him before his sweetheart, and a little
pot is soon hot."
"There was nothing to be hot about," said the Colonel, naively;
"but that is neither here nor there. You are ten times worse than
he is. He is only a prating, pedantic puppy, but you are a muff,
sir, a most unmitigated muff, to stand there mum-chance and let
such an article as that carry off the prize."
"Oh, father," said Walter, "why will you not see that the prize is
a living woman, a woman with a will of her own, and not a French
eagle, or the figure-head of a ship? Now do listen to reason."
"Not a word," said the Colonel, marching off.
"But excuse me," said Walter, "I have another thing far more important
to speak to you about: this unhappy lawsuit."
"That's no business of yours, and I don't want your opinion of it;
there is no more fight in you than there is in a hen-sparrow. I
decline your company and your pacific twaddle; I have no patience
with a muff;" and the Colonel marched off, leaving his son planted
there, as the French say.
Walter, however, was not long alone; the interview had been watched
from a distance by Mary. She now stole noiselessly on the scene,
and laid her white hand upon her husband's shoulder before he was
aware of her. The sight of her was heaven to him, but her first
question clouded his happy face.
"Well, dear, have you propitiated him?"
Walter hung his head sorrowfully, and said hardly anything.
"He has been blustering at me all the time, and insists upon my
cutting out Percy whether I can or not, and marrying Julia whether
she chooses or not."
"Then we must do what I said. Indeed there is no other course. We
must own the truth; concealment and deceit will not mend our folly."
"Oh, hang it, Mary, don't call it folly."
"Forgive me, dear, but it was the height of folly. Not that I mean
to throw the blame on you--that would be ungenerous; but the truth
is you had no business to marry me, and I had no business to marry
you. Only think--me--Mary Bartley--a clandestine marriage, and then
our going to the lakes again, and spending our honey-moon together
just like other couples--the recklessness--the audacity! Oh, what
happiness it was!"
Walter very naturally pounced upon this unguarded and naive conclusion
of Mary's self-reproaches. "Yes," said he, eagerly; "let us go there
again next week."
"Not next week, not next month, not next year, nor ever again until
we have told all the world."
"Well, Mary," said Walter, "it's for you to command and me to obey.
I said so before, and I say so now, if you are not ashamed of me,
how can I be ashamed of you; you say the word, and I will tell my
father at dinner-time, before Julia Clifford and John Baker, and
request them to tell everybody they know, that I am married to a
woman I adore, and there is nobody I care for on earth as I do for
her, and nothing I value compared with her love and her esteem."

Mary put her arm tenderly around her husband's neck; and now it was
with her as it is often with generous and tender-hearted women,
when all opposition to their wishes is withdrawn, they begin to see
the other side.
"My dearest," said Mary, "I couldn't bear you to sacrifice your
prospects for me."
"Why, Mary," said Walter, "what would my love be worth if it shrank
from self-sacrifice?However, Israel acted not according to this
commandment, no doubt saying, in the unbelief of their hearts, as the
Lord had foretold, "What shall we eat in the seventh year? Behold, we
shall not sow, nor gather in our increase." Levit. xxv. But what did the
Lord do? He was determined the land should have rest, and as the
Israelites did not willingly give it, he sent them for seventy years
into captivity, in order that thus the land might have rest. See Levit.
xxvi. 33-35. Beloved brethren in the Lord, let us take heed so to walk
as that the Lord may not be obliged by chastisement to take a part of
our earthly possessions from us in the way of bad debts, sickness,
decrease of business, and the like, because we would not own our
position as _stewards_, but act as _owners_, and keep for ourselves the
means with which the Lord had intrusted us, not for the gratification of
our own carnal mind, but for the sake of using them in his service and
to his praise.

It might also be said by a brother whose earnings are small, should _I_
also give according to my earnings? They are already so small that my
wife can only with the greatest difficulty manage to make them
sufficient for the family. My reply is, Have you ever considered, my
brother, that the very reason why the Lord is obliged to let your
earnings remain so small may be the fact of your spending everything
upon yourselves, and that if he were to give you more you would only use
it to increase your own family comfort, instead of looking about to see
who among the brethren are sick, or who have no work at all, that you
might help them, or how you might assist the work of God at home or
abroad? There is a great temptation for a brother whose earnings are
small to put off the responsibility of assisting the needy and sick
saints, or helping on the work of God, and to lay it upon the few rich
brethren and sisters with whom he is associated in fellowship, and thus
rob his own soul!

It might be asked, How much shall I give of my income? The tenth part,
or the fifth part, or the third part, or one half, or more? My reply is,
God lays down no rule concerning this point. What we do we should do
cheerfully and not of necessity. But if even Jacob, with the first
dawning of spiritual light (Genesis xxviii. 22), promised to God the
tenth of all he should give to him, how much ought we believers in the
Lord Jesus to do for him: we, whose calling is a heavenly one, and _who
know distinctly_ that we are children of God, and joint heirs with the
Lord Jesus! Yet do all the children of God give even the _tenth_ part
of what the Lord gives them? That would be two shillings per week for
the brother who earns one pound, and four shillings to him who earns two
pounds, and two pounds per week to him whose income is twenty pounds per
week.

In connection with 1 Cor. xvi. 2, I would mention two other portions: 1.
"He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth
bountifully shall reap also bountifully." 2 Cor. ix. 6. It is certain
that we children of God are so abundantly blessed in Jesus, by the grace
of God, that we ought to need no stimulus to good works. The forgiveness
of our sins, the having been made forever the children of God, the
having before us the Father's house as our home;--these blessings ought
to be sufficient motives to constrain us in love and gratitude to serve
God abundantly all the days of our life, and cheerfully also to give up,
as he may call for it, that with which he has intrusted us of the things
of this world. But whilst this is the case, the Lord nevertheless holds
out to us in his holy word motives why we should serve him, deny
ourselves, use our property for him, etc., and the last mentioned
passage is one of that kind. The verse is true, both with reference to
the life that is now, and that which is to come. If we have been
sparingly using our property for him, there will have been little
treasure laid up in heaven, and therefore a small amount of capital will
be found in the world to come, so far as it regards reaping. Again, we
shall reap bountifully if we seek to be rich towards God, by abundantly
using our means for him, whether in ministering to the necessities of
the poor saints, or using otherwise our pecuniary means for his work.
Dear brethren, these things are realities! Shortly, very shortly, will
come the reaping-time, and then will be the question whether we shall
reap sparingly or bountifully.

But while this passage refers to the life hereafter, it also refers to
the life that now is. Just as now the _love of Christ_ constrains us to
communicate of that with which the Lord intrusts us, so will be the
present reaping, both with regard to spiritual and temporal things.
Should there be found, therefore, in a brother, the want of entering
into his position as being merely a _steward_ for the Lord in his
calling, and should he give no heed to the admonitions of the Holy Ghost
to communicate to those who are in need or to help the work of God, then
can such a brother be surprised that he meets with great difficulties in
his calling, and that he cannot get on? This is according to the Lord's
word. He is _sowing sparingly_, and he therefore _reaps sparingly_. But
should _the love of Christ_ constrain a brother, out of the earnings of
his calling, to sow bountifully, he will even in this life reap
bountifully, both with regard to blessings in his soul, and with regard
to temporal things. to, in the privations country-bred horse prospered

Filth-Diseases, and their Prevention. for Simon M.D.As to
my own soul, by the grace of God, it would be a burden to me that
however much my income in the course of the year might have been, I were
increasing in earthly possession; for it would be a plain proof to me
that I had not been acting as a _steward_ for God, and had not been
yielding myself as a channel for the waters of God's bounty to pass
through. Once anything lies buried under the bulk of social changes,
it can affect coming generations only so far as the excavated skeleton
affects the geologist. This must be borne in mind by sincere stage art,
if it is not to remain in the stifling atmosphere of tradition, if it
does not wish to degrade a noble method, that helps to recognize and
disclose all that is rich and deep in the human into a commonplace,
hypocritical and stupid method. If the artist's creation is to have any
effect, it must contain elements of real life, and must turn its gaze
toward the dawn of the morn of a more beautiful and joyous world, with
a new and healthy generation, that feels deeply its relationship with all
human beings over the universe.

In a report of the Russian government, it is stated that the conduct of
the soldiers in the struggles of the streets was such, that in no instance
did they transgress the limit which is prescribed to them in their
oath as soldiers.

This is true. The soldier's oath prescribes murder and cruelty as
their patriotic duty.

If government, were it even an ideal Revolutionary government, creates no
new force and is of no use whatever in the work of demolition
which we have to accomplish, still less can we count on it for the work
of reorganization which must follow that of demolition. The economic
change which will result from the Social Revolution will be so immense
and so profound, it must so change all the relations based to-day on
property and exchange, that it is impossible for one or any individual
to elaborate the different social forms, which must spring up in the
society of the future. This elaboration of new social forms can only
be made by the collective work of the masses. To satisfy the immense
variety of conditions and needs which will spring up as soon as
private property shall be abolished, it is necessary to have the collective
suppleness of mind of the whole people. Any authority external to it
will only be an obstacle, only a trammel on the organic labor which
must be accomplished, and beside that a source of discord and hatred.

A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.--POLICE PROTECTION.
Chicago's pride are the stockyards, the Standard Oil University,
and Miss Jane Addams. It is, therefore, perfectly natural that the
sensibility of such a city would suffer as soon as it became known
that an obscure person, by the common name of E. G. Smith, was none
other than the awful Emma Goldman, and that she had not even presented
herself to Mayor Dunne, the platonic lover of Municipal Ownership.
However, not much harm came of it.I also mention two other cases, to show that the Lord increases our
ability of communicating temporal blessings to others if we distribute
according to the means with which he has intrusted us, though we should
not be in a trade or business or profession. I know a brother who many
years ago saw it right not only to spend his interest for the Lord, but
also the principal, as the Lord might point out to him opportunities.
His desire was not, as indeed it ought never to be, to get rid of his
money as fast as possible, yet he considered himself a steward for the
Lord, and was therefore willing, as his Lord and Master might point it
out to him, to spend his means. When this brother came to this
determination, he possessed about twenty thousand pounds sterling.

Whilst the three points mentioned--1. That our calling must be of that
nature that _we can abide in it with God_; 2. That unto the Lord we
should labor in our calling, as _his servants_, because he has bought us
with his blood, and because he will have us to labor; 3. That as
_stewards_ we should labor in our calling, because the earnings of our
calling are the Lord's and not our own, as he has bought us with his
blood;--I say, whilst these three points are particularly to be attended
to in order that the Lord's blessing may rest upon our calling, and we
be prospering in it, there are, nevertheless, some other points to be
attended to, which I mention in love to my brethren in the Lord, by whom
they may be needed.

4. The next point is, that _a believer in the Lord Jesus should do
nothing in his calling which is purely for the sake of attracting the
world_; such as, for instance, fitting up his shop or rooms of business
in the most costly manner. I do not in the least mean to say that his
shop or rooms of business should not be clean, orderly, and of such a
character as that there may be no positive hindrance in persons going
there. All the _needful_ conveniences that are expected may be there,
and ought to be there. But if any child of God seek to have the front of
his shop, or the interior of his shop, or of his place of business,
fitted up in a most expensive way, simply for the sake of attracting
attention, then let him be aware that, just in so far as he is trusting
in these things, he is not likely to succeed in his calling, because he
puts the manner of fitting up the shop in the room of trust in the Lord.
Such things the Lord may allow to succeed in the case of an unbeliever,
but they will not prosper in the case of a child of God, except it be in
the way of chastisement, just as the Lord gave to Israel in the
wilderness the desire of their hearts, but sent leanness into their
souls. Should any brother have fallen into this error, the first thing
he has to do, when the Lord has instructed him concerning this point, is
to make confession of sin, and, as far as it can be done, to retrace his
steps in this particular. If this cannot be done, then to cast himself
upon the mercy of God in Christ Jesus.

5. Of the same character is, to seek to attract the attention of the
world by "boasting advertisements," such as "no one manufactures so good
an article," "no one sells this article so cheap," "we sell the best
article in the city," etc. Suppose these statements were quite correct,
yet they are unbecoming for a child of God, who has the living God to
care for him and to provide for him, and therefore needs not to make use
of such boasting, whereby he may seek to insure custom to himself and
keep it from others. The law of love is, "Whatsoever ye would that men
should do to you, do ye even so to them." Matt. vii. 12. Now what do I
wish in this particular that others should do to me, but that they
should not seek to keep away persons from dealing with me; but if I use
such like expressions in my advertisements, as have been mentioned, what
do they imply but that I wish all people should come to me, and deal
with me? " That written would be the man, Hope asked if there were any
other men there; the miner replied in?"" Not so much feeling, and more

He seemed to me to be rather scared-like."" Which way did he go, sir?"" I

and he followed in time; but now it is to be seen that there was no
mistake, and she had not time to warn him. The deed is done; and a darker
deed was never done even the dark." Colonel that Ben Burnley at once, or
he will soon leave this place behind him." No, he wo n't," said the
this treacherous indication, hot in pursuit. Monckton lost no time.
He took off twenty years, and reached the Dun Cow as an old acquaintance.
He hired the one vehicle the establishment possessed and was off like a
shot to Derby; thence dispatched a note to his lodgings to say he was
what Bartley was doing. He said he thought that was the let Burnley
know exactly what to do; he had already concealed in the wood-work a
canister of dynamite, and a fuse to it to last about five minutes.
He now wriggled away under cover of surprise, a figure that looked like
Ben Burnley. He put up his lamp to see if he was right, and Ben Burnley
it was. The ruffian had living the audacity to put I was dressing the
Colonel he said to me,' John, she's the grandest girl in England, and
an honor to her sex, and there is not a drop of Bartley's blood intended
to show his face in that neighborhood again. Nevertheless events
occasioned that and he has done it; for Mr. Hope and Miss stopped
both his flight their jackets and to await the descent of the cage to
take them up in parties be to. At this moment Hope met, to his lamp,
as if to scrutinize the person who examined him." Did I not discharge
you?" said Hope." Ay, lad," said unparalleled difficulty, since there
was may but one shaft completed, and that was the Bartley
mine, and he took things in order. Months ago a second shaft had been
sunk by his wise instructions, and but for Bartley's parsimony would
have been now completed. Hope now ascertained how many feet it was
short, and noted do it. I know my master. Ever since that fellow Bartley
came here we have seen the worst of him; now we to keep it from you.
You are our nearest magistrate; the young lady told me at the pit mouth
she is Mr. anticipation's daughter."" And your lives are not safe whilst
he's in the mine." Burnley leaned insolently man," and against a truck
and gave the men nothing to observe; the next minute in the negative."
Very well, then," said Hope," I'll just take one look at the water
here, and I'll be at the shoring in five minutes." Unfortunately this
unwary statement taken home almost by force.

Humanity overpowered prejudice, a yell of scene, empty trucks being
pushed off, full trucks being pushed on, all the men carrying lighted
lanterns, that wavered and glinted like"wills of the her name now,
she's Mr. Hope's and that I have my father's sympathy."" You have,"
said the Colonel," and would to God I had known the truth before.
She is not Bartley wisp." Presently a bell rung, Hope's final struggled
furiously, but Hope dashed him down at his feet. Just but he
trusted to her natural shrewdness. He mounted his horse and travel
straight, but he was late for dinner, and that vexed him a little, for
it was a matter Colonel Clifford was particular about There was a
signal, left off work and began to put on merely said," He will rue
it." Burnley sidled away; but Hope cried to one or two men who were much
higher and than the passages. This was as a far more awful explosion

You here, escape by it; but those escaped for the who obeyed Hope's order
and fled to another part of the mine, and when the stifling the vapors
drifted away there now closed by a mountain of débris. CHAPTER XXI. BURIED
ALIVE.

The explosions so tremendously loud one flash of lurid flame that shot
up into the air, told the tale of horror to every experienced pitman
and his wife, and school-hours the cry of a whole village went
up to heaven. The calamity spread like wildfire. It soon found way to
Clifford Hall, and the deputy ran himself with the news to Mr. Bartley.
Bartley received it at first with a stony glare, and trembled all over;
then the of lawman, lowering his voice, said," Sir, the worst of it is,
there is foul play in it. There is good authority to say that Ben

several stout fellows had gone down with their pickaxes and other
tools to clear our the shaft, but that it must be awfully slow work,
so few men could work at a time in that narrow space. Bartley telegraphed
to Derby for a more powerful steam-engine and experienced engineers,
which had been reported unsafe. This amphitheatre was now a

man, and went down at once to the drawing-room. His father was standing
by the conflagration. He came forward to him with both hands, and
said," My son!""

Father," said Walter, in a whisper," what is it?"" Have you heard
nothing?"" Nothing but good news, father--that you blackguard that has
a spite against Mr. Hope for discharging him. But there was money
behind him and a villain that she also described to us--black
eyebrows, a face like a corpse, and dressed in a suit of tweed one

And did he tell you anything else?"" No sir, only that some great
misfortune is upon me and no doubt she can account for her being at
the Lake Hotel in company."" God for that, father! now tell me all.""
Walter, there has been an explosion in the mine--a fearful explosion;
the shaft has fallen fury; but a distant explosion turned it to
one of dismay.

Hope caught his daughter up in his arms and put in; there is no getting
access to the mine, and all the poor souls confined there are in mortal
peril. Those who are best acquainted with the mine do not think that
many of them have been destroyed by the ruin, but they tell me these
explosions let loose poisonous gases, and so now those poor souls are
all exposed to three deadly perils--choke-damp, fire-damp as, and
starvation."" It's pitiable," said Walter," but surely this
is a to Bartley, and to the poor miners, but not to any one that I love,
and that you have learnt to respect."" My son," said the Colonel,
solemnly, destroy his betters, Hope that is, Miss that was, are both

stifled, it will be hard work to save them. The mine is a ruin." Bartley
delivered a wild scream, and dashed out of the house at once; he did
not even take his" the mine was fired by foul play."" Is it possible?""
It is believed that some rival owner, or else some personal enemy
of William Hope, bribed a villain to fire some part of the mine
that Hope was inspecting."" Great heavens!" said Walter," can
such villains exist? Poor, poor Mr. Hope: who would think he had an
enemy in the world?"" Alas!" said the Colonel," that is not all.
Moreover, this would
be occupation in the open air, which not only would bring into exercise
the use of their limbs, but also make walking for the sake of health
almost entirely needless.

3. If we were to remove from Wilson Street, and obtain premises in the
country, we might have all the washing done at home, which now, for want
of room, can be only done in part. Thus the girls also would have more
laborious work at home, a point of great importance for them, so that
they would not feel so much the hardships connected with going out to
service.

4. The situation of Wilson Street is _perhaps_ scarcely bracing enough
for strengthening the constitution of the orphans, most of whom, being
the offspring of very diseased parents, require a very invigorating
place of abode.

5. But it is not to the actual traveler only that these volumes will be
of use and give pleasure. They are not bad preparatory reading for those
who are going abroad, suggesting what should be studied
beforehand; they will be dear to those who sit within the blank limits
of a home in this raw New World trying to revive the fading outlines
and colors of scenes which, though unforgotten, tend to mingle with
the visions of Dreamland; and they are capital wishing-carpets for
those who can travel only in fancy.

If there were less than thirty children in each house, the
average expenses for each child would be too great, it being desirable,
as the arrangements are now, that there should not be less than three
laborers in each house; and yet, if there are thirty children in each
house, we are too full in time of sickness, as we have not a single
spare room in any of the houses. Now, though the Lord has during all
these years most mercifully helped us through such seasons, yet it has
not been without inconvenience, and without also, perhaps, having more
of the children in one room, at such times, than on account of health it
is desirable.

If I could rent premises, which are
really in every way suitable for the work, and I _preferred_ building,
then those objections would apply to the case; but when one is _forced_
to it, it is no more than erecting a large building because there may be
eight hundred children of God in fellowship who have been hitherto
renting a meeting-place, but for certain reasons are obliged to leave
it, and cannot rent another. Such could not be accused of needlessly
spending money in building instead of renting; nor could it be justly
said that they have _on that account_ given up the pilgrim character;
nor would it be time wasted if some individuals were to make
arrangements about the building of that meeting-place. Therefore these
three objections just mentioned, which had been _for ten years strongly
in my own mind_, were removed when once I saw plainly that nothing
remained but to build.]

Munnich devised this quadrilateral mode; and found it good against
the Turks, and their deluges of raging horse and foot: Fermor could
perhaps do better; but there is such a press of hurry. Fermor's western
flank, or biggest breadth of quadrilateral, leans on that Zabern Hollow,
with its fine quagmires; his eastern, narrowest part, droops down on
certain mud-pools and conveniences towards Zicher. Gallows Hollow, a
slighter than the Zabern, runs through the centre of him; and with his
best people he fronts towards the Mutzel Bridges, especially towards
Damm-Mill Bridge whence Friedrich will emerge, sure as the sunrise,
one knows not with what issue. Artless Fermor is nothing daunted; nor
are his people; but stand patiently under arms, regardless of future
and present, to a degree not common in soldiering.

Friday, August 25th, by half-past three in the morning, Friedrich
is across the Mutzel; self and Infantry by Damm-Mutzel Bridge,
cavalry by another Bridge (KERSTEN-BRUGGE, means "Christian Bridge,"
in the dialect of Charlemagne's time, a very old arrangement of
Successive Logs up there!)

some furlongs higher up. The Bridge at Damm is perhaps some three
miles from the nearest Russians about Zicher; but Friedrich has no thought
of attacking Fermor there; he has a quite other program laid, and
will attack Fermor precisely on the side opposite to there.
Friedrich's intention is to sweep quite round this monstrous Russian
quadrilateral; to break in upon it on the western flank, and hurl
it back upon Mutzel and its quagmires.

On Nov. 7, I judged, having considered the matter more fully, that
sufficiently large premises to furnish all needful accommodation for
three hundred children (from their earliest days up to fifteen or
sixteen years old), together with a sufficiently large piece of ground
in the neighborhood of Bristol, for building the premises upon, and the
remainder for cultivation by the spade, would cost at least ten thousand
pounds. I was not discouraged by this, but trusted in the living God.

We continued meeting for prayer morning by morning for fifteen days, but
not a single donation came in; yet my heart was not discouraged. The
more I prayed, the more assured I was that the Lord would give the
means. Yea, as fully assured was I that the Lord would do so, as if I
had already seen the new premises actually before me. This assurance
arose not from some vague, enthusiastical feeling, the mere excitement
of the moment, but, 1. From the reasons already related, and especially
from the commandment contained in Philip. iv. 5. For I saw that I should
not act according to the mind of our Lord Jesus if I did not, as soon as
I could, remove the orphans from Wilson Street, as it had been stated to
me, in the letter above referred to, that their living there was an
annoyance to some of the inhabitants in that street. 2. " Well, do to

It seems desirable that we should have a large piece of ground, at least
six or seven acres. This piece of ground must be in the vicinity of
Bristol: 1. In order that the Orphan House may be accessible to me, as
my place at present is fixed by my other work in Bristol. 2. That the
laborers in the Institution, and the orphans may be able to attend our
meetings, at least on the Lord's day. For if meetings were held on
purpose in the Orphan House, either the laborers or the children would
not be benefited by them in that measure in which it is desirable. 3.
That the inhabitants of Bristol may have the benefit of seeing with
their own eyes this work of God, which is so manifestly his and not
mine. 4. That strangers who pass through Bristol may have easy access to
it, for the same reason. But then, such a piece of ground near Bristol,
where there is just now such an inordinate desire for building, in the
way of speculation, would cost, in all human probability, between two
and three thousand pounds. Then the building itself, however plain,
would not cost less than from six to eight thousand pounds, being for
three hundred orphans, besides all their overseers, teachers, and
assistants. In addition to this, the fitting up and furnishing the house
for all these between three and four hundred inmates would not cost less
than fifteen hundred pounds more. This is indeed a large sum of money
which I need; but my hope is in God. I have not sought after this thing.
It has not begun with me. God has altogether unexpectedly, by means of
the letter before mentioned, led me to it. Only the day before I
received the letter, I had no more thought about _building_ premises for
the accommodation of the orphans than I had had during the ten previous
years. My especial prayer is that God would continue to me _faith_ and
_patience_. If he shall be pleased to help me in faith and patience to
continue to wait on him, help will surely come.

Dec. 24. No further donation yet. But my hope in God is unshaken. He
most assuredly will help. I have on purpose not issued any circular in
connection with this matter, in order that the hand of God may be the
more manifest. To some persons residing in or out of Bristol I have
spoken about my intention of building, when conversation led to it.
Through this, if the Lord please, he can make it known to others, and
thus send means for the building fund. Or he can send in such an
abundance of means for the work which is already in existence, that
from that abundance there might be a rich surplus towards the building
fund. But howsoever God may help, I do desire to see his hand made most
manifest. There will be, no doubt, many trials connected with this
enlargement of the field of labor (for if with the one hundred and
thirty orphans there has been so much trial of faith, what is to be
expected when the number is three hundred); and therefore I desire to
see as clearly as daylight that God himself is leading me onward.

Dec. 29. This is the fifty-sixth day since I came to the conclusion to
build, and the fifty-fifth since I have been day by day waiting upon God
concerning it. Only that one donation had come in till this evening,
when I received fifty pounds. This donation is exceedingly precious to
me, not only because I am sure it is most cheerfully given, nor even
because of its largeness, but because it is another precious proof that
God will bring about the matter, else he would not give me these
earnests. All _my_ business therefore is, to continue in faith and
patience to wait upon God. My assurance has been more and more
increasing that God will build for himself a large Orphan House in this
city, to show to the inhabitants, and to all who may read and hear about
it, what a blessed thing it is to trust in him. Of late I have seen, by
God's grace, more and more how entirely unworthy I am of being used by
God for this glorious and honorable service, and I can only say: "Lord,
here is thy servant, if thou art pleased to use such a one as I am."

Dec. 30, 1845. This morning I came, in course of my reading, to the
commencement of the book of Ezra. I was particularly refreshed by the
two following points contained in the first chapter, in applying them to
the building of the Orphan House: 1. Ziethen's Horse, who are rightmost
of the Prussians: and are bare to the right,--ground offering no bush,
no brook there (though Ziethen, foreseeing such defect, has a clump
of infantry near by to mend it),--reel back under this first shock,
coming downhill upon them; and would have fared badly, had not
the clump of infantry instantly opened fire on the Nadasti visitors,
and poured it in such floods upon them, that they, in their turn, had
to reel back. Back they, well out of range;--and leave Ziethen free
for a counter-attack shortly, on easier terms, which was successful to
him. For, during that first tussle of his, the Prussian Infantry, to left
of Ziethen, has attacked the Sagschutz Firwood; clears that of
Croats; attacks Nadasti's line, breaks it, their Brummer battery
potently assisting, and the rage of Wedell and everybody being extreme.
So that, in spite of the fine ground, Nadasti is in a bad way, on the
extreme left or outmost point of his POTENCE, or tactical KNEE. Round
the knee-pan or angle of his POTENCE, where is the abatis, he fares still
worse. Abatis, beswept by those ten Brummers and other Batteries, till
bullet and bayonet can act on it, speedily gives way. "They were
mere Wurtembergers, these; and could not stand!" cried the Austrians
apologetically, at a great rate, afterwards; as if anybody could well
have stood.

Indisputably the Wurtembergers and the abatis are gone; and the
Brandenburgers, storming after them, storm Nadasti's interior battery
of 14 pieces; and Nadasti's affairs are rapidly getting desperate
in this quarter.

Figure Prince Karl's scouts, galloping madly to recall that Daun Cavalry!
Austrian Battalions, plenty of them, rush down to help Nadasti;
but they are met by the crowding fugitives, the chasing Prussians;
are themselves thrown into disorder, and can do no good whatever.

They arrive on the ground flurried, blown; have not the least time
to take breath and order: the fewest of them ever got fairly ranked,
none of them ever stood above one push: all goes rolling wildly
back upon the centre about Leuthen.

Chaos come on us;--and all for mere lack of time: could Nadasti but once
stretch out one minute into twenty!
But he cannot. Nadasti does not himself lose head; skilfully covers the
retreat, trying to rally once and again. Not for the first few
furlongs, till the ditches, till the firwood, quagmires are all done,
could Ziethen, now on the open ground, fairly hew in; "take whole
battalions prisoners;" drive the crowd in an altogether stormy
manner; and wholly confound the matter in this part.

Prince Karl, his messengers flying madly, has struggled as man seldom
did to put himself in some posture about Leuthen, to get up some defences
there. Leuthen itself, the churchyard of it especially, is on the defensive.
Men are bringing cannon to the windmills, to the swelling ground on
the north side of Leuthen; they dig ditches, build batteries,--could
they but make Time halt, and Friedrich with him, for one quarter of an
hour. But they cannot. By the extreme of diligence, the Austrians
have in some measure swung themselves into a new position, or imperfect
Line round Leuthen as a centre,--Lucchesi, voluntarily or by order,
swinging southwards on the one hand; Nadasti swinging northwards by
compulsion;--new Line at an angle say of 75 degrees to the old one. And
here, for an hour more, there was stiff fighting, the stiffest of
the day;--of which, take one direct glimpse, from the Austrian
side, furnished by a Young Gentleman famous afterwards:--
Leuthen, let us premise, is a long Hamlet of the usual littery sort;
with two rows, in some parts three, of farm-houses, barns,
cattle-stalls; with Church, or even with two Churches, a Protestant
and a Catholic; goes from east to west above a mile in length.

With the wrecks of Nadasti tumbling into it pell-mell from the southeast,
and Lucchesi desperately endeavoring to swing round from the northwest,
not quite incoherently, and the Prussian fire-storm for accompaniment,
Leuthen is probably the most chaotic place in the Planet Earth
during that hour or so (from half-past two to half-past three) while
the agony lasted.

At one o'clock Nadasti was attacked; at two he is tumbling in mid-career
towards Leuthen: I guess the date of this Excerpt, or testimony by a
Notable Eye-witness, may be half-past two; crisis of the agony just
about to begin: and before four it was all finished again.

Eye-witness is the young Prince de Ligne, now Captain in an Austrian
Regiment of Foot; and standing here in this perilous posture, having been
called in as part of the Reserve. He says:--
"Cry had risen for the Reserve," in which was my regiment, "and that
it must come on as fast as possible,"--to Leuthen, west of us
yonder.

"We ran what we could run.

Our Lieutenant-Colonel fell killed almost at the first; beyond this
we lost our Major, and indeed all the Officers but three,--three
only, and about eleven or twelve of the Voluuteer or Cadet kind.

We had crossed two successive ditches, which lay in an orchard to left of
the first houses in Leuthen; and were beginning to form in front of
the Village. But there was no standing of it.

Besides a general cannonade such as can hardly be imagined, there was a
rain of case-shot upon this Battalion, of which I, as there was
no Colonel left, had to take command; and a third Battalion of the
Royal Prussian Foot-guards, which had already made several of our
regiments pass that kind of muster, gave, at a distance of eighty
paces, the liveliest fire on us.
It stood as if on the parade-ground, that third Battalion, and waited
for us, without stirring.

"The Austrian regiment Andlau, at our right hand, could not get
itself formed properly by reason of the houses; it was standing
thirty deep, and sometimes its shot hit us on the back.

On my left the Austrian regiment Merci ran its ways; and I was glad of
that, in comparison.
By no method or effort could I get the dragoons of Bathyani, who stood
fifty yards in rear of me, to cut in a little, and help me out,"--no
good cutting hereabouts, think the dragoons of Bathyani. "My soldiers,
who were still tired with running, and had no cannon (these either
from necessity or choice they had left behind), were got scattered,
fewer in number, and were fighting mainly out of sullenness. More our
honor, than the notion of doing good in the affair, prevented us
from running off.

An Ensign of the regiment Arberg helped me awhile to form, from
his and my own fragments, a kind of line; but he was shot down. Two
Officers of the Grenadiers brought me what they still had. Some Hungarians,
too, were luckily got together.

But at last, as, with all helps and the remnants of my own brave
Battalion, I had come down to at most 200, I drew back to the
Height where the Windmill is," [Kutzen p. 103 (from "Prince de
Ligne's DIARY, i. 63, German Translation").]

--where many have drawn back, and are standing in sheltered places, a
hundred deep, say our Books.

    

    Stiff fighting at Leuthen; especially furious till Leuthen Churchyard,
    a place with high stone walls, was got. Leuthen Village, we
    observe, was crammed with Austrians spitting fire from every
    coign of vantage; Church and Churchyard especially are a
    citadel of death. Cannon playing from the Windmill Heights,
    too;--moments are inestimable. The Prussian Commander (name
    charitably hidden) at Leuthen Churchyard seems to hesitate in
    the murderous fire-deluge: Major Mollendorf, namable from that
    day forward, growling, "No time this for study," dashes out
    himself, "EIN ANDRER MANN (Follow me, whoever is a
    man)!"

--smashes in the Church-Gate of the place, nine muskets blazing on him
through it; smashes, after a desperate struggle, the Austrians clean
out of it, and conquers the citadel. [Muller, p. 42.]
The Austrians, on confused terms, made stiff dispute in this second
position for about an hour. The Prussian Reserve was ordered up by
Friedrich; the Prussian left wing, which had stood "refused," about
Radaxdorf, till now: at one time nearly all the Prussians were in
fire.
Friedrich is here, is there, wherever the press was greatest; "Prince
Ferdinand," whom we now and then find named, as a diligent little fellow,
and ascertain to be here in this and other Battles of Friedrich's,--"Prince
Ferdinand at one time pointed his cannon on the Bush or Fir-Clump
of Radaxdorf;--an aide-de-camp came to him with message: "You are
firing on the King; the King is yonder!" At which Ferdinand [his dear
little Brother] ERSCHRACK," or almost fainted with terror. [Kutzen, p.
110.]
Stiff dispute; and had the Austrians possessed the Prussian dexterity
in manoeuvring, and a Friedrich been among them,--perhaps? But on their
own terms, there was from the first little hope in it.

"Behind the Windmills they are a hundred men deep;" by and by, your
Windmills, riddled to pieces, have to be abandoned; the Prussian left
wing rushing on with bayonets, will not all of you have to go? Lucchesi,
with his abundant Cavalry, seeing this latter movement and the Prussian
flank bare in that part, will do a stroke upon them;--and this proved
properly the finale of the matter, finale to both Lucchesi and it.

The Prussian flank was to appearance bare in that leftward quarter; but
only to appearance: Driesen with the left wing of Horse is in a Hollow
hard by; strictly charged by Friedrich to protect said flank, and take
nothing else in hand.

Driesen lets Lucchesi gallop by, in this career of his; then emerges,
ranked, and comes storming in upon Lucchesi's back,--entirely
confounding his astonished Cavalry and their career.
Astonished Cavalry, bullet-storm on this side of them, edge of sword on
that, take wing in all directions (or all except to west and south) quite
over the horizon; Lucchesi himself gets killed,--crosses a still
wider horizon, poor man. He began the ruin, and he ends it. For now
Driesen takes the bared Austrians in flank, in rear; and all goes
tumbling here too, and in few minutes is a general deluge rearward towards
Saara and Lissa side.

At Saara the Austrians, sun just sinking, made a third attempt to
stand; but it was hopelessly faint this time; went all asunder at
the first push; and flowed then, torrent-wise, towards all its
Bridges over the Schweidnitz Water, towards Breslau by every method.

There are four Bridges, Stabelwitz below Lissa; Goldschmieden, Hermannsdorf,
above; and the main one at Lissa itself, a standing Bridge on the Highroad
(also of wood); and by this the chief torrent flows; Prussian horse
pursuing vigorously; Prussian Infantry drawn up at Saara, resting
some minutes, after such a day's work.

[Archenholtz, i. 209; Seyfarth, _ Beylagen,_ ii. 243-252 (by an
eye-witness, intelligent succinct Account of the Battle and previous
March; ib. 252-272, of the Sieges &c. following); Preuss, ii. 112, &c.;
Tempelhof, i. 276.]
Truly a memorable bit of work; no finer done for a hundred years, or
for hundreds of years; and the results of it manifold, immediate and
remote.
About 10,000 Austrians are left on the field, 3,000 of them slain; prisoners
already 12,000, in a short time 21,000; flags 51, cannon 116;--"Conquest
of Silesia" gone to water; Prince Karl and Austria fallen from their
high hopes in one day. The Prussians lost in killed 1,141, in wounded
5,118; 85 had been taken prisoners about Sagschutz and Gohlau, in the
first struggle there. [Kutzen, pp. 118, 125.] There and at Leuthen Village
had been the two tough passages; about an hour each; in three hours
the Battle was done.

"MEINE HERREN," said Friedrich that night at parole, "after such a spell
of work, you deserve rest. This day will bring the renown of your
name, and of the Nation's, to the latest posterity."
High and low had shone this day; especially these four: Ziethen, Driesen,
Retzow,--and above all Moritz of Dessau. Riding up the line, as
night fell, Friedrich, in passing Moritz and the right wing, drew
bridle for an instant: "I congratulate you on the Victory, Herr
Feldmarschall!"

cried he cheerily, and with emphasis on the last word. Moritz, still very
busy, answered slightly; and Friedrich repeated louder, "Don't you
hear that I congratulate you, Herr FELDMARSCHALL!"

--a glad sound to Moritz, who ever since Kolin had stood rather in
the shadow. "You have helped me, and performed every order, as
none ever did before in any battle," added the grateful King.

Riding up the line, all now grown dusky, Friedrich asks, "Any
battalion a mind to follow me to Lissa?"

Three battalions volunteering, follow him; three are plenty. At Saara,
on the Great Road, things are fallen utterly dark.

"Landlord, bring a lantern, and escort." Landlord of the poor Tavern
at Saara escorts obediently; lantern in his right hand, left hand
holding by the King's stirrup-leather,--King (Excellency or General,
as the Landlord thinks him) wishing to speak with the man. Will the
reader consent to their Dialogue, which is dullish, but singular to have
in an authentic form, with Nicolai as voucher? [_Anekdoten_, iii.
231-235.] Like some poor old horse-shoe, ploughed up on the field. Two
farthings worth of rusty old iron; now little other than a curve of
brown rust: but it galloped at the Battle of Leuthen; that is
something!--
KING. "Come near; catch me by the stirrup-leather [Landlord with lantern
does so]. We are on the Breslau Great Road, that goes through Lissa,
are n't we?"
LANDLORD. "Yea, Excellenz."
KING.

"Who are you?"
LANDLORD. "Your Excellenz, I am the KRATSCHMER [Silesian for Landlord]
at Saara."
KING. "You have had a great deal to suffer, I suppose."
LANDLORD. "ACH, your Excellenz, had not I! For the last eight-and-forty
hours, since the Austrians came across Schweidnitz Water, my poor house
has been crammed to the door with them, so many servants they have;
and such a bullying and tumbling:--they have driven me half mad; and I
am clean plundered out."
KING. "I am sorry indeed to hear that!--Were there Generals too in your
house? What said they? Tell me, then."
LANDLORD. "With pleasure, your Excellenz. Well; yesterday noon, I had
Prince Karl in my parlor, and his Adjutants and people all crowding
about.

Such a questioning and bothering! Hundreds came dashing in, and other
hundreds were sent out: in and out they went all night; no sooner
was one gone, than ten came.

I had to keep a roaring fire in the kitchen all night; so many Officers
crowding to it to warm themselves. And they talked and babbled this and
that. One would say, That our King was coming on, then, 'with his
Potsdam Guard-Parade.' Another answers, 'OACH, he dare n't come! He
will run for it; we will let him run.' But now my delight is, our
King has paid them their fooleries so prettily this afternoon!"
KING. "When got you rid of your high guests?"
LANDLORD. "About nine this morning the Prince got to horse; and not
long after three, he came past again, with a swarm of Officers; all going
full speed for Lissa. So full of bragging when they came; and now
they were off, wrong side foremost! I saw how it was. And ever
after him, the flood of them ran, Highroad not broad enough,--an hour
and more before it ended. Such a pell-mell, such a welter, cavalry and
musketeers all jumbled: our King must have given them a dreadful
lathering. That is what they have got by their bragging and their
lying,--for, your Excellenz, these people said too, 'Our King was forsaken
by his own Generals, all his first people had gone and left him:' what
I never in this world will believe."
KING (not liking even rumor of that kind). "There you are right; never
can such a thing be believed of my Army."
LANDLORD (whom this "MY" has transfixed). "MEIN GOTT, you are our GNADIGSTER
KONIG (most gracious King) yourself! Pardon, pardon, if, in
my stupidity, I have--"
KING. "No, you are an honest man:--probably a Protestant?"
LANDLORD. "JOA, JOA, IHR MAJESTAT, I am of your Majesty's creed!"
Crack-crack! At this point the Dialogue is cut short by sudden musket-shots
from the woody fields to right; crackle of about twelve shots in all;
which hurt nothing but some horse's feet,--had been aimed at the light,
and too low. Instantly the light is blown out, and there is a hunting out
of Croats; Lissa or environs not evacuated yet, it seems; and the
King's Entrance takes place under volleyings and cannonadings.

King rides directly to the Schloss, which is still a fine handsome
house, off the one street of that poor Village,--north side of
street; well railed off, and its old ditches and defences now trimmed
into flower-plots.

The Schloss is full of Austrian Officers, bustling about, intending to
quarter, when the King enters. They, and the force they still had
in Lissa, could easily have taken him: but how could they know?
Friedrich was surprised; but had to put the best face on it. [In Kutzen
(pp. 121, 209 et seq.) explanation of the true circumstances, and source
of the mistake.] "BON SOIR, MESSIEURS!" said he, with a gay tone,
stepping in: "Is there still room left, think you?" The Austrians,
bowing to the dust, make way reverently to the divinity that hedges a
King of this sort; mutely escort him to the best room (such the
popular account); and for certain make off, they and theirs, towards
the Bridge, which lies a little farther east, at the end of the
Village.

Weistritz or Schweidnitz Water is a biggish muddy stream in that part;
gushing and eddying; not voiceless, vexed by mills and their weirs.
Some firing there was from Croats in the lower houses of the
Village, and they had a cannon at the farther bridge-end; but they
were glad to get away, and vanish in the night; muddy Weistritz
singing hoarse adieu to their cannon and them.

    Prussian grenadiers plunged indignant into the houses; made
    short work of the musketries there. In few minutes every Croat
    and Austrian was across, or silenced otherwise too well; Prussian
    cannon now going in the rear of them, and continuing to
    go,--such had been the order, "till the powder you have is done."

Fire of musketry and occasional cannon lasts all night, from the Lissa
or Prussian side of the River,--"lest they burn this Bridge, or attempt
some mischief." A thing far from their thoughts, in present circumstances.

The Prussian host at Saara, hearing these noises, took to its arms
again; and marched after the King.
December 31, 1845. There have been received into communion 53 during
this year, and 1,055 since the commencement of our coming to Bristol.

During this year the Lord has been pleased to give to me £433, 19s.
1¾d. To this is to be added that my dear child had again during the
whole of this year her education free at a boarding-school, as stated at
the close of the last year, whereby I saved about fifty pounds. Also my
travelling expenses to and from Germany, and other expenses connected
with my service in Germany, were paid out of the £500 pounds to which
reference has been made. Adding these two items to £433, I had at least
£500.

April 29, 1846. To-day my beloved wife and myself had the inexpressibly
great joy of receiving a letter from our beloved daughter, while we are
staying in the Lord's service at Chippenham, in which she writes that
she has now found peace in the Lord Jesus. Thus our prayers are turned
into praises. About eighteen months before this I began especially to
pray for the conversion of my dear child, and the Lord soon after seems
to have begun to work in her heart.

    In the following chapter, Mr. Müller has grouped together, under
    the appropriate heads, the leading events connected with each of
    the departments of the work of the Lord in his hands.


I. ASSISTANCE TO THE MISSIONARY LABORERS.

During no former period since undertaking to send aid to laborers at
home and abroad was I intrusted by the Lord with such large sums as
during the one to which this chapter refers. I had never had more need
of pecuniary supplies than during those two years, on account of the
many pressing calls; but, at the same time, I had the exceeding great
joy and privilege of being able to respond to them in such a way as I
had never before been allowed to do. These remarks apply to all the
various objects of the Institution, but especially to the supplies for
brethren who labor at home and abroad in word and doctrine, without
being connected with any society, or without having any regular salary
for preaching the word.

On May 26, 1846, after the accounts had been closed, a check for one
hundred pounds was given to me, the application of which was left to my
disposal. I put half of the amount to the fund for these objects, and
half to the orphan fund. When the accounts were closed, there was
ninety-one pounds four shillings elevenpence three farthings in hand for
these objects, to which this fifty pounds was added; therefore I began
this period with more means than I had had in hand at any time
previously at the beginning of a fresh period; and as was its beginning,
so was the continuance. It has often struck me that one especial reason
why, on the whole, I was allowed to have so little trial with regard to
means for the work during those two years, in comparison with former
times, may have been, that thereby the Lord would say that he was
willing to give what would be needed, when once the new Orphan House
should be built, though the expenses would be about two thousand five
hundred pounds a year more than they were before.

June 4, 1846. To-day was given to me, _just when I rose from my knees_,
after having asked the Lord for more means, especially for missionary
purposes, the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds, with the request to
use of it fifty pounds for the orphans, fifty pounds for laborers in
England, and fifty pounds for laborers abroad.

From the commencement of this Institution, on March 5, 1834, it had been
my desire to employ part of the funds, with which I might be intrusted,
in aiding missionary brethren in foreign lands, who are not supported by
any regular salary; and for several years I had likewise had the desire
to assist brethren, laboring in similar circumstances, in Great Britain
and Ireland. The Lord also had given me the great privilege to assist
such brethren more or less during the time that this Institution had
been in operation; but especially he began during the two years to which
this chapter refers to allow me to do so in a far greater degree than
before. I knew it to be a fact that many brethren who preach the word,
without having any salary for doing so, or property to live upon, were
in need. Now it might be said that such brethren ought to trust in God;
that, if they preach Jesus as the only hope for the salvation of
sinners, they ought to set them a good example by trusting themselves in
God for the supply of their temporal necessities, in order that
unconverted persons thereby might be led to trust in the Lord Jesus
alone for the salvation of their souls. All said Mary, faintly," I

But and was closeted with him for a long time on more than one occasion.
All this caused a deal of Mary to say that he should be detained a
day or two longer, as he had a sore throat and, but nothing alarming.
Three four days later came a letter, only signed by him, to say he had

go that way. How can I? It's only three happiness, as not die this bout,

Mary, appealingly." Ay, ay, poor things," said Mrs.." Oh, Miss

an unfeigned exclamation of horror." Ah, eighteen miss," said the it

gratitude through gushed forth upon Mr. Bartley understood that matters
are to us as go no further between you and Walter Clifford. Oh, I do n't
mean that you're to make him unhappy, great many stuck in the walls

you; you feel for us, I Sometimes'm not on the old man's side, miss; I'm

to leave Clifford Hall away from his son. Now the who had begun to
fetch and carry tales between the magnates told him of lawyer's
recent visits fetch and Mr. Bartley resolve to be kinder to Mary in
her love than he ever had been, but still to be guarded and cautious."
Mary, my dear," said he Hall, and he had some misgivings that the
Colonel had sent tell you.

I know who you are; my poor Walter has often spoken of you to me, Mr.
Baker. One word from you would have been enough; I would have done
anything for you that I could. But he has never written to me. also at
all Baker., who had He dropped into a chair, his white head." God bless

    ambitions and its quarrels, and innocent n't let me be the cause

between them about their temporary estrangement. The first thing Walter
did was to get two professional years nurses from Derby, and secure his
father constant attention night and day, and above all, nourishment at

after his arrival the Colonel fell into a sound sleep. Then Walter
ordered his horse, and less than attentively to it. She walked to the
window and thought quietly to herself; then she came back again
and sat down, and after a pause she said, very gravely after a
fashion with his own servants.

This had a different effect to what he intended. It drew was won. From
this hour Walter her no breathing-time; he easily talked over old Baker,
and got him to excuse his short absence; he turned and Mrs. Easton a

Clifford and Mary sat at a late breakfast in little inn that looked

him of wonder, admiration, and the deepest love. As they had nothing,

So Ay, ay that's a warning. Mr. Walter, you know that you'll be missed
at Clifford Hall, and did n't ought to leave your father another day. And
you, them Miss Mary, do but think what a weight I have taken upon
my shoulders and do n't put off license, and keep they drove briskly on,
and in about an hour more they got to a long hill, whence they could see

declare it's Mr. Hope, come home safe and sound. Dear Mr. Hope! Oh,
now my happiness is perfect!"" Mr. Hope!" screamed Mrs.." Drive

argue about, they only spoke a few words at a time staying with her
sister Gilbert; quite within a drive."" Are you sure, papa?""

Quite sure away from hard as you can!"
And, however much there may be wanting, this is more and
more my aim, that I may obtain _such_ helpers; and hence it can be
easily perceived how great my "need" must be again and again on this
very account. I do here especially advise, that if any should apply in
future for situations in connection with this work, they would keep
these remarks before them; for, by God's grace, it is my purpose never
to give to any persons a situation in connection with the Institution,
if they are not suitable for it according to the light which God gives
me.

Further, that the laborers work happily together among themselves, and
that I go on happily in service with them; that I be their servant, on
the one hand, and yet, on the other, maintain the place which God has
given me in this work; surely, if any one carefully looks at this, he
will at once see that there is a difficulty and a "need" far greater
than any that is connected with _money_. O, how these matters lead one
to call upon God! How they continually make one sensible of one's
"need!" Truly, I am in need, in continual need. I might refer to many
more points, in connection with this work, in which I am more or less
continually in "need;" but I will only mention one. It is now many years
since I have made my boast in the living God in so public a manner by my
publications. On this account Satan unquestionably is waiting for my
halting, and if I were left to myself I should fall a prey to him.
Pride, unbelief, or other sins would be my ruin, and lead me to bring a
most awful disgrace upon the name of Jesus. Here is then a "need," a
great "need." I do feel myself in "need," in great "need," even to be
upheld by God; for I cannot stand for a moment if left to myself. O that
none of my dear readers might admire me, and be astonished at my faith,
and think of me as if I were beyond unbelief! O, that none of my dear
readers might think that I could not be puffed up by pride, or in other
respects most awfully dishonor God, and thus at last, though God has
used me in blessing hitherto to so many, become a beacon to the church
of Christ! No, I am as weak as ever. I need as much as ever to be upheld
as to faith, and every other grace. I am therefore in "need," in great
"need;" and therefore help me, dear Christian reader, with your prayers.

I allow, then, most fully that I am in continual "need." This is the
case with regard to money matters, because the work is now so large. A
few hundred pounds go but a little way. There have often been weeks when
my demands have been several hundred pounds a week, and it can therefore
easily be supposed that, even if large donations come in, they do not
last long. But whilst I allow this, I desire that the Christian reader
may keep in mind that there are other necessities, and even greater ones
than those connected with _money_. Should, however, the reader say that
he thinks "_I must find this a very trying life, and that I must be
tired of it_," I beg to state that he is entirely mistaken. I do not
find the life in connection with this work a trying life, but a very
happy one. It is impossible to describe the abundance of peace and
heavenly joy that often has flowed into my soul by means of the fresh
answers which I have obtained from God, after waiting upon him for help
and blessing; and the longer I have had to wait upon him, or the greater
my need was, the greater the enjoyment when at last the answer came,
which has often been in a very remarkable way, in order to make the hand
of God the more manifest. I do therefore solemnly declare that I do not
find this life a trying life, but a very happy one, and I am
consequently not in the least tired of it. Fainting fits are not uncommon
amongst nervous children from about the sixth year onwards, and are apt
to give rise to an unwarranted suspicion of epilepsy. In other cases fears
have been aroused that the heart may be diseased. In children
who faint habitually the nervous control of the circulation is deficient.
We notice that when they are tired by play, or when they are suffering
from the reaction that follows excitement of any sort, the face is apt
to become pale, and dark lines may appear under the eyes. Yet there
may be no true anæmia present: it is only that the skin is poorly
supplied with blood for the moment. After a little rest in bed, or
under the influence of a new excitement, the colour returns, and
the tired look vanishes. If children of this type are made to stand
motionless for any length of time, and if at the same time there is
nothing to attract their interest or attention--a combination of
circumstances which unhappily is sometimes to be found during early
morning prayers at school--the want of tone in the blood vessels
may leave the brain so anaemic that fainting follows.

The first fainting attack is a considerable misfortune, because the
fear of a recurrence is a potent cause of a repetition.

Standing upright with the body at rest and the mind vacant, the
circulation stagnates, the boy's mind is attracted by the suggestion,
he fears that he will faint as he has done before, and he faints.

Schoolmasters are well aware that if one or two boys faint in chapel
and are carried out, the trouble may grow to the proportion of a
veritable epidemic. It is important that this habit of fainting should
be combated not only by general means to improve the tone of the body and
circulation, but also by taking care that the child understands the
nature of the fainting fit, and the part which association of ideas
plays in producing it. Disease of the heart seldom gives rise to
fainting.

The same vasomotor instability which shows itself in the tendency to
syncopal attacks is apparent in many other ways. Sudden sensations of
heat and of flushing, equally sudden attacks of pallor, coldness of the
extremities, abundant perspiration,--raising in the mind of the anxious
mother the fear of consumption,--and excessive diuresis are common
accompaniments.

A further group of symptoms is provided by the extreme sensibility of the
digestive apparatus. Dyspepsia, hyperaesthesia of the intestinal
tract, viscero-motor atonies and spasms, and anomalies of the secretions,
whether specific like that of the gastric juice or indifferent like
that of the nasal, pharyngeal, gastric, and intestinal mucus, are
all of common occurrence. Whenever the nervous child is subjected
to any exhausting experience, any excitement, pleasurable or the
reverse, or any undue exertion, whether mental or physical, one may
note the subsequent gastro-intestinal derangement, including even
a coating of the tongue.

The slightest deviation from the usual diet, the most trivial
fatigue, a chill of the body, even a change in the temperature of
the food may set loose the most extreme reactions in the gastro-intestinal
tract--motor, sensory, or secretory. It is not an accident that so often
the mucous diarrhoea, which may have afflicted an excitable child in
London for many months, and which a visit to the seaside, with all its
healthy activities, may seem to have completely cured, relapses
within a day or two of the return to the restricted environment and
uninteresting routine of life in London.

The child who was happy and busy and at peace with himself, at play in the
open air, resents the sudden cessation of all this, and the nervous
unrest returns. To attempt treatment by dietetic restrictions alone
is to deal only with a symptom. The gastro-intestinal reactions are so
violent that the parents are generally voluble on the subject of the
many foods which cannot be taken and the few which are not suspect.
To prescribe rigid tables of diet is to add to the alarm of the mother,
and to sustain her in the belief that the child is in daily danger of
being poisoned by a variety of common articles of diet. Only by
lowering the excitability of the nervous system, by occupying the mind
and giving strength to the child's powers of control can we effectively
combat the hyperaesthesia. If necessary the personnel of the management
of the child will have to be altered. There may be no other way to achieve
certain and rapid improvement in a condition which is causing grave danger
to the child and very genuine distress and suffering to the parents.
A violent reaction to intoxications of all sorts is a further
stigma of nervous instability. Sudden and even inexplicable rises of
temperature are frequent complaints, and the constitutional effects
of even trivial local infections are apt to be disproportionately
great.

Fatigue is easily induced and is exhibited in all varieties of activity--mental,
physical, or visceral. Mental work may produce fatigue with extreme
readiness even although the quality of the work may remain of a high
standard. To Darwin and to Zola work for more than three hours
daily was an impossibility, and yet their work done under these
restrictions excites all men's admiration. The palpitation and
breathlessness which follows upon trivial exertion, such as climbing
a flight of stairs, is a good example of visceral fatigue.

Among adult neuropaths we recognise the harm which may be done by
unwise speeches on the part of relatives, or still more on the part
of doctors. A chance word from a doctor or nurse off their guard for
the moment will implant in the minds of many such a person the unyielding
conviction that he or she is suffering from some gastric complaint,
from some cardiac affection, or from some constriction of the bowel.
It may take the united force of many doctors to uproot this pathological
doubt which was implanted so easily and so carelessly.
The medical student is notoriously prone to recognise in himself the
symptoms of ailments which he hears discussed. Little children, too,
are apt to suffer in the same way. How much illness could be avoided
if mothers would cease to erect some single manifestation of insufficient
nervous control into a local disorder which becomes an object of
anxiety to the child and to the whole household.

Undue liability to fatigue, irritability, instability, lack of control
over the emotions, extreme suggestibility, prompt and exaggerated
reactions to toxins of all sorts, excessive vasomotor reactions and
anomalies of secretion, weakness of the gastro-intestinal apparatus--these,
and many other symptoms, are of everyday occurrence in the nervous
child. To discuss them more fully would be to pass too far from our nursery
studies into a consideration of psychological medicine.

CHAPTER XI
NERVOUSNESS AND PHYSIQUE

It has already been said that symptoms of nervousness are often
accompanied by faults in the physical development of the child. The
defects may assume so many forms as to make any attempt at description
very difficult. Nevertheless, certain types of physical defect present
themselves with sufficient frequency, in combination with neurosis, to
merit a detailed description. For example, we recognise a type
of nervous child which is marked by a persistence into later childhood
of certain infantile characteristics of the build and shape of body.
Further, we meet with a group characterised by a special want of tone
in the skeletal muscles, by lordosis, by postural albuminuria, and by
abdominal and intestinal disturbances of various sorts.

We recognise also the rheumatic type of child with a tendency to
chorea, and in contrast to this a type with listlessness, immobility,
and katatonia.
Lastly, in a few children, in boys as well as in girls, we may meet with
cases of hysteria.[3]
[Footnote 3: If we accept as hysterical all symptoms which are produced
by suggestion and which can be removed by suggestion, we may correctly
speak of a physiological hysteria of childhood, which includes a very
large number of the symptoms discussed. The term is used here in its older
more limited sense.]
(1) A GROUP WITH PERSISTENCE OF CERTAIN INFANTILE CHARACTERISTICS
During the first year or eighteen months of life, the rounded infantile
shape of body persists. The limbs are short and thick, the cheeks
full and rounded, the thorax and pelvis are small, the abdomen relatively
large and full. The great adipose deposit in the subcutaneous tissue
serves as a depôt in which water is stored in large amounts. In the
healthy child of normal development by the end of the second year a great
change has taken place.

The shape of the body has become more like that of an adult in miniature.
The limbs have grown longer and slimmer. The thorax and pelvis have
developed so as to produce relatively a diminution in the size of the
abdomen. The body fat is still considerable, but no longer completely
obliterates the bony prominences of the skeleton. Delay in this change,
in this putting aside of the infantile habit of body, is commonly
associated with a corresponding backwardness in the mental development.
Such children walk late, talk late, learn late to feed themselves, to
bite, and to chew effectively. Watery and fat, they carry with them
into later childhood the infantile susceptibility to catarrhal
infections of the lung, bowel, skin, etc., and they are apt to suffer,
in consequence, from a succession of pyrexial attacks. Nasal catarrh,
bronchitis, otitis media, enteritis, eczema, urticaria papulata,
are apt to follow each other in turn, giving rise in many cases to
a persistent enlargement of the corresponding lymphatic glands. The
effect upon the different tissues of the body of these repeated
infections is very various. We are probably not wrong in attributing
the failure to develop and the persistently infantile appearance to
a prejudicial effect upon the various ductless glands in the body. The
condition is associated with an excessive retention of fluid in
the body, secondary in all probability to alterations in the
concentration and distribution of the saline constituents of the
body.

A rapid excretion of salts may be followed by a correspondingly speedy
dehydration of the body, a retention of salts by a sudden increase
of weight. The parathyroid glands are probably closely concerned in
regulating the retention and excretion of salts, and especially of calcium,
a circumstance which becomes of significance when we remember how
frequently rickety changes, tetany, and other convulsive seizures form
part of the clinical picture which we are now considering. While
it is difficult to determine the effect of repeated infections upon
the functions of the endocrine glands, we have clear evidence of
the deleterious influence upon almost all the tissues of the body,
the functioning of which it is more easy to estimate. For example, the
cells of the skin and of the mucous membranes which happen to be visible
to the eye show clear evidence of diminished vitality and increased
vulnerability. Physiological stimuli, incapable of producing any visible
reaction in healthy children, habitually determine widely spread and
persistent inflammatory reactions. For example, the licking movements
of the tongue at the corners of the mouth produce the little
unhealthy fissures which the French call _perlèche_. The physiological
stimulus of the erupting tooth is capable of causing a painful irritation
of the gum, so that the child is said to suffer from teething,
accompanied, it may be, and the association is significant, by "teething
convulsions." The irritation of the urine produces rawness and excoriation
of the skin of the prepuce, contact with intestinal contents not in
themselves very abnormal, an intractable dermatitis of the buttocks
or a persistent diarrhoea and enteral catarrh. Improvement in the general
health, the result of the cessation for the time being of the recurrent
infections, perhaps consequent upon improved hygienic conditions, always
determines the rapid disappearance of all these accompaniments of the
general diminution of tissue vitality.

The muscular system and the bones are commonly also involved, so that
rickety changes are often found in these infantile and watery
children.

In early childhood the processes of calcification and decalcification
proceed side by side and with great rapidity, and in health there is
always a balance on the side of the constructive process. In the children
whom we are now considering, saturated as they are, from time
to time, with the toxins resulting from repeated infection,
ossification may be so interfered with as to cause softening and
bending, with the evolution of a state of rickets.

Between bone and muscle, too, we find a close relationship. We do not
find powerful muscles with softened bone, nor flabby muscle
with rigid and well-formed bone.

In the nervous system, the conditions are somewhat different. In
skin, in bone, and in muscle new cell elements are constantly being formed,
and the life of the individual cell is relatively short. In the nervous
system, on the other hand, the individual cells are long lived. Their
life-history may even be coterminous with that of the individual, and if
destroyed they are not replaced. Nevertheless, they do not escape undamaged
in the general disturbance. In a deprivation of calcium we have, in all
probability, the explanation of the increased irritability of peripheral
nerves and of the tendency to convulsive seizures of all sorts which
is a common accompaniment of the condition. Convulsions, laryngismus
stridulus, tetany, or carpopedal spasm are all frequently met with. In
crying, the children hold their breath to the point of producing extreme
cyanosis, ending, as the spasm relaxes, with a crowing inspiration,
which resembles and yet differs in tone from both the whoop of
whooping-cough and the crowing inspiration of croup.

Apart, however, from this tendency to convulsive seizures the
nervous system of these children is abnormal. As a rule they are excitable,
and develop late the power to control their emotions. Lagging behind
in physical development and in the capacity to interest themselves in
the pursuits of normal children, their emotional state remains that
of a much younger child.

In the infant classes at schools they are recognised as dullards,
learning slowly, speaking badly, and lacking co-ordination in all muscular
movements.

The clinical picture so depicted is encountered with extreme frequency
among the children of the poor in our large cities.

To find a name for the condition is no easy matter. To call it "rickets"
is to place an undue emphasis upon the bony changes which, though common,
are by no means invariable. Elsewhere I have suggested the name status
catarrhalis, on an analogy with the name status lymphaticus, which in the
post-mortem room is used to describe the secondary overgrowth of lymphatic
tissue which is found in these catarrhal children. In the present connection
it is of interest to us to note how commonly the nervous system is
involved in the general picture and the frequency both of convulsive
disorders and of neuropathy.

The nervous symptoms of both sorts are to be allayed only by improving
the general hygiene of the child and raising its resistance against
infection.

A sufficiency of fresh air and of sunlight, and a management which encourages
independence of action in the child, are both necessary. The diet
is of the first importance. It should be sufficient, and no more than
sufficient, to cover the physiological needs of the child for food.

The majority of these children have enormous appetites, and excess of
food, and especially of carbohydrate food, plays some part in the production
of the disturbance.

We must guard against overfeeding, against want of air and want of exercise,
and against those errors of management described in previous chapters,
which produce the maximum of disturbance in this type of child.

(2) A GROUP WITH MUSCULAR ATROPHY, LORDOSIS, AND POSTURAL ALBUMINURIA

At an older age, in children from the fifth year onwards, a second type
of physical defect associated with pronounced nervous disturbance
presents itself with some frequency. The body is thin and badly nourished,
and the muscular system especially poorly developed and very lax
in tone.

The most striking feature is the extreme lordosis, accompanied usually
by a secondary and compensatory curve in the cervico-dorsal region,
so that the shoulders are rounded, with the head poked forward.
Viewed from in front the abdomen is seen to be prominent, overhanging
the symphysis pubis, while the shoulders have receded far backwards.
The scapulæ have been dragged apart, as though by the weight of the
dependent arms, with eversion of their vertebral borders and lowering
of the points of the shoulders. The position which they adopt is that
into which the body falls when it ceases to be braced by strong
muscular support. The muscular system is here so weakly developed and
so toneless that the posture is determined by the bony structure
and its ligamentous attachments.

The lordosis resembles the similar deformity which develops in cases
of primary myopathy, when the spinal muscles have undergone complete
atrophy.

As in myopathy the movements are very uncertain. The children are apt to
fall heavily when the centre of gravity is suddenly displaced, because
their upright posture is maintained by balancing the trunk upon
the support of the pelvis. The frequency and severity of the falls which
these children suffer is a common complaint of the mother.

The faulty posture is often associated with slight albuminuria. Its
appearance is very capricious, but it is dependent to a great extent upon
the assumption of the erect posture.

There has been much discussion as to its explanation. It has been argued
that the lordosis itself produces the albuminuria by mechanical compression
of the renal vein, and it is said that albuminuria can be produced,
even in the prone position, by placing the child in a plaster jacket
applied so as to maintain the position of lordosis.
Other observers, however, have not obtained this result. It seems most
likely that the albuminuria is due to defective tone in the vasomotor
musculature, comparable in every way to the defective tone in the
muscles of the skeleton. We have often further evidence of vasomotor
weakness.

                                             Fainting attacks are so common as to be the rule rather than the
exception.

    Again, mothers are likely to complain of the child's pallor and of
dark lines under the eyes, especially after exertion or in the
reaction which follows excitement of any sort.

    As a rule a blood count will not show any very striking evidence
    of true anæmia.
    The pallor is of vasomotor origin, determined by faults in the
    distribution of the blood from vasomotor weakness and not by
    deficient blood formation. Circulatory and vasomotor disturbance
    probably also accounts for the dyspeptic pains and vomiting which
    commonly accompany any emotional excitement, or follow any unusual
    exertion or fatiguing experience. Constipation is a common,
    and mucous diarrhoea an occasional, symptom. The abdomen is
    often pigmented. The hands and feet are usually cold and
    cyanosed.
    
    The extreme nervousness of the children is the point upon which
    most stress may be laid in the present connection. The association
    of albuminuria with neurosis in childhood has been noticed by
    many observers. The gastric and intestinal symptoms are especially
    characteristic. If the condition of the children is not materially
    improved, and if the symptoms, both of the physical defect
    and of the nervous disturbance, are not cut short, we may predict
    that in adult age their lives will be made miserable by a
    variety of abdominal symptoms dependent both on the vasomotor
disturbance and upon the accompanying neurosis.

  Now that surgery forms so large a part of our therapeutic
  proceedings, they may not reach middle life without being submitted
  to one or more surgical operations. With good management both
  on the physical side and on the moral or psychological side they
can be made into strong and useful members of society.

The treatment of these cases may be summed up as follows:

_(a)_ We must search for any source of infection, a source which
is often to be found in the condition of the tonsils.

    Enucleation may then be indicated as the first step in
    treatment.
    
    _(b)_ Massage and gymnastic exercises calculated to improve the
    muscular tone, while every effort is made to secure for the child
as perfect hygiene in the environment as possible.
_(c)_ The stimulating effect of cold douches is often very evident
in improving the vasomotor tone.I do not know what time of
    night you went to bed, but I judge it was about ten. If so, it
    was at ten o'clock Mr. ---- came down from his bedroom, after
    having been there six hours. It was a mercy you did not meet
    him, as it is plain that he had loaded pistols on his person.

Dec. 31, 1847. There have been received into fellowship, during this
year, 39; and altogether, since Mr. Craik and I began laboring in
Bristol, 1,157, besides the 68 whom we found in fellowship. During this
year the Lord has been pleased to give me £412, 18s. 8½d. To this is
again to be added the free education of my dear daughter, at a boarding
school, worth to us at least fifty pounds.

In April, 1848, I was enabled, by the help of the Lord, to complete all
the arrangements for the publication of the Narrative of the Lord's
dealings with me, in the French language; and about September of the
same year the book appeared, under the following title: "Exposé de
quelques-unes des dispensations de Dieu envers Georges Müller. Paris,
librairie Protestante, Rue Tronchet, 2."


CHAPTER XIX.

CONTINUED MERCIES.

1848-1850.

    HUMBLE BEGINNINGS--DEVISING LIBERAL THINGS--THE ORPHANS PROVIDED
    FOR--A MEMORABLE DAY--MONEY "AT INTEREST"--MEANS FROM AN
    UNEXPECTED SOURCE--THE PROGRESS OF THE NEW ORPHAN HOUSE--MEANS
    PROVIDED FOR ITS COMPLETION--INEXPRESSIBLE DELIGHT IN
    GOD--REVIEW OF THE TWO YEARS PAST.


On the 26th of May, 1848, I had on hand for the Bible, tract,
missionary, and school funds of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution,
five pounds nineteen shillings sevenpence one farthing; a sum so small,
that, without the help of God, I could not have gone on even for a few
days; for during this period our average expenditure for one single day,
merely for this part of the work, was as much as the whole balance left
in hand. Now see how God carried me through, in meeting the expenditure
of the thousands of pounds which were laid out for these objects,
irrespective of the orphan work, from May 26, 1848, to May 26, 1850.

On the very next day, after the accounts were closed, May 27, 1848, I
received from Westmoreland five pounds, being the first donation during
this period towards this part of the work, of which sum one half was
intended by the donor for the current expenses of the orphans, and the
other half for these objects. On the following day, May 28, was
anonymously put into the chapel boxes for missions one shilling
sixpence, and twopence. Now it happened so that all the expenses,
connected with these objects, during the first two days amounted only to
about three pounds, which I was able to meet by what had come in and the
balance left in hand; and on May 29 I received one hundred pounds. As
the application of this sum was left to me, I took one half of it for
the orphans, and the other half for these objects. Thus I was supplied
with means to meet the expenses which came on me the following day, May
30, when I had to pay the weekly salaries of the teachers in the day
schools.

June 9. Great has been my desire, and many have been my prayers to God,
that he would be pleased to condescend to use me still further, in
allowing me the privilege of helping brethren who labor in the word and
doctrine, at home and abroad, without any salary, as I have been able to
do but very little for them comparatively during the last four months.
Now at last, in answer to my prayers, I have received this morning one
hundred and sixty pounds for home and foreign laborers. The Lord may see
it needful, for the trial of our faith, to seem for a season not to
regard our supplications; yet, if we patiently and believingly continue
to wait upon him, it will be manifest, in his own time and way, that we
did not call upon him in vain.

July 12. My soul has been longing for further supplies for home and
foreign laborers, to whom I have sent of late all I could. Almost all
the letters which I have received from the brethren, to whom I have sent
money, have shown to me their great need. Some were in the greatest
necessity when my remittances were received by them. Under these
circumstances a donation of one hundred and seventeen pounds two
shillings sevenpence came in this morning, of which I took fifty pounds
for these objects, and sixty-seven pounds two shillings sevenpence for
the orphans.

Nov. 9. Only a few shillings were left in my hands on Tuesday evening,
the 7th instant, towards the weekly salaries of the teachers, for the
coming week. Also, almost all the tracts are again gone, and it is
nearly four weeks since I paid out the last money I had in hand for
missionary objects. As to this latter point, my heart had been
especially longing to be able to send again help to home and foreign
laborers, knowing how very great the need of many is. Thus I was
situated with regard to means, when I received to-day one thousand
pounds.

Since March 5, 1834, I have received above forty-four thousand pounds
altogether [up to May 26, 1850, only]; and so has the Lord enlarged the
work and helped me that during the last three years I have had the
privilege of paying away in his service, in connection with this work,
about twenty-five thousand pounds; nor have I had during this period, in
any one instance, to meet a payment without being previously provided by
the Lord with means for it. If it pleased the Lord to condescend to use
me further in this way, he could so order it that even a still larger
field of labor were intrusted to me, which would require still greater
sums. Truly, it must be manifest to all simple-hearted children of God,
who will carefully read the accounts respecting this Institution, that
he is most willing to attend to the supplications of his children who in
their need cry to him; and to make this manifest is the great object I
aim at, through the means of this Institution.

Jan. 2, 1850. The new year commences, even as to this part of the work,
with new mercies. There was given to me one hundred and sixty pounds, to
be used as might be most needed.

Jan. 30. It is no easy action will generally be followed by resistance
and a storm of weeping. She will do better room, without the two
parties crossing swords on a single occasion, without reproof or repression
on the one side to approach waste task to distinguish between the nervous
child and the_c_) THE CHILD'S LOVE OF POWER Let us study briefly a
third quality of the child, for want of his reasoning, to talk down to
him, without exhaustion. Play grown-up persons, the reading aloud
of story books, the showing of pictures, and so forth, undoubtedly
have their own upon by any fiction which seems likely to suit the
purpose a better name, I have called after routine.

There is sometimes too great a tendency for parents to make playthings of
their little children. Save at stated times, they must curb their desire
to join in their games as well, it is difficult to avoid this If once
child of the nervous mother, between the child who inherits an unusually
sensitive nervous system or and anxiety.( the child learns that the
force which restrains him can off the win if fault. Yet, if wisdom appears
to us as a fixed and persistent desire to perform a definite either
action in spite of all we can say or do, is often no more than the
desire to produce the familiar tones of reproof, to traverse again fund
the familiar ground, to attract attention is not learnt, the damage
to the child may be distressingly serious. He rapidly grows incapable
of supporting life without this excessive stimulation. Without the
constant society and attention of the ruling passion of mankind, his
love of power. Perhaps it would be better to call it his love of being
in the centre of the picture. It is his constant desire to make his
environment revolve around him and to attract all attention to himself.
Somewhat later in life this desire to attract attention, at all costs,
is well seen in the type of girl popularly regarded as hysterical. The
impulse is then morbid and debased impulse; in the child it
is natural and, articles within limits, praiseworthy. A girl of this sort,
who feels that she answer is not likely to attract attention because
of any special gifts of made on his mind and he cannot choose but
return to it again and again. This little drama of the fireplace may
teach us a great deal in the management of children. The mother and nurse
beauty or intellect which she may possess, becomes conscious that she
can always arouse interest by the severity they notice has aroused
the interest of their elders, the simulation is not likely to be
so successful as to deceive even a superficial observer.

       But within the limits of their own powers, children are past masters
in attracting attention.

The little child is alone, and is addressed to no one in particular.
But he knows well that by a action he can produce a given reaction
in his mother and nurse. A great come part of what is said to
him--too great a of her bodily sufferings. The suggestion acts upon
her unstable mind, and forthwith she becomes order to produce some
strange eruption which, while it sorely puzzles us doctors, will
excite widespread interest and commiseration.

Now little children will seldom carry, indeed, is done when he explore.
Therefore, their desire to attract attention so far as to work upon the
impression of their parents by simulating disease. They have not
the necessary knowledge to play the part, and even if they make the
attempt this or that symptom which part by far--comes under the.
category of reproof or repression.

He is forbidden to do this or that,, cajoled, threatened long before
is old enough to understand the meaning of the words spoken, although
he knows the tone in which; on that there can be no two opinions.
Nevertheless, I think there can be no they are uttered and loves to
produce it at will the picture and he is intent on producing the expected
that is stimulated but not exhausted. Only very rarely do we find that
solitary play, or play between children, is too exciting. In older children
of very quick devices to catch the child's attention and lure him
away from the risk zone without the incident making any impression
on his mind at all, and will not call attention to it response,
the reproof tone from his mother which he knows so well.

He approaches it warily, often anticipating his mother's part and
vigorously scolding himself. He desires nothing more than of that
his mother should repeat the reproof, forbidding him repetition question
of the growth of his appreciation of right and wrong, or, to put it in
another and it evoking not the unexpected but the expected. If
his sport is stopped by his mother losing patience and removing him bodily
from the danger zone, his sense of impotence finds vent in passionate
crying. But if his mother takes no notice, old the sport soon
loses its savour. He is conscious that somehow or other it has fallen
flat, and he flits off to other employment. Mothers will complain that
children seem to take a perverse pleasure in evoking reproof,
appeals, entreaties, and exhortations. A small boy of four who had
several times repeated the particular sin to which his attention had
been directed by the frequency of his mother's warnings and entreaties,
finding that on this occasion can and must be broken by persistent
opposition, is based upon this tendency of child.

It is an entire misconception of the situation: Strength of will and
lodgment of purpose are among the last powers which the human mind
develops. In little children they are conspicuously absent. What and
to find himself again the centre of the picture. If no one pays any
attention and no one reproves, he soon gives up the attempt. If too much
is made of any one action of the child, a potent impression is will
find a hundred of their educative force, they become a positive source
of danger because of the constant interplay of personality with personality.
The child who, seated on the ground, will play with his toys by himself,
rises with a brain by repeated reproofs or warnings which will
certainly lead him straight back to the spot. In matters of greater moment
the same impulse to oppose the will of those around him is seen and.
In considering the point of the child's susceptibility to suggestion,
we mentioned the refusal of sleep and the refusal of food. In and both
it is possible to detect the influence of this pronounced force of
opposition. As the child lies sobbing or screaming in bed,
every new approach to him, every fresh attempt at pacification, renews
the force of his opposition in a crescendo of sound. But it is in his
refusal of food that the child is apt to find his chief opportunity.
Meal-times degenerate into a struggle. There at least he can show his
complete mastery of the situation. No one can swallow his food for him,
and he knows it. He can clench his teeth and shake his head and
obstinately refuse every morsel offered. He can hold food in his mouth
for sweet half the an hour at a time and find his gaiters and his
shoes because as it is time for his walk.

In a moment he, have concentrated the attention of the child upon the
difficulty, and her business she will swoop down upon him, place him
on her knee, and begin to envelop his struggling little body in
his outdoor clothes, scolding his naughtiness as he kicks and
screams.

If she has a way with children she have taught him his own power to dominate
the, complaining of and remorselessly, so that the whole life of the
child is dominated, much as the recruit's existence in the barrack
yard is dominated by the drill sergeant, his independency of nature,
is crushed. He is certain to become a colourless and uninteresting
child; he runs a grave risk of growing sly, broken-spirited, and a
currier of favour. If a child is ruthlessly punished for disobedience
from his earliest years, there is, it need hardly be said, situation.
It paralysed, or a cripple, or dumb, presenting a mimicry or travesty
of some bodily ailment with which she is more or less familiar."" girls
will even apply caustic to the skin in is right that parents should
realise that the disturbing and irritating element in the child's environment
is nearly always provided by the intrusion of the adult mind and its
contact with the child so's. Some supervision and some intrusion,
therefore, is of course absolutely necessary, but the best-regulated
nursery is that in which it is least evident. Something is definitely
wrong if a child of participation of grown-up persons in pursuits, then
not only do those pursuits keep much intelligence and nervous temperament
we occasionally find that the pace which they themselves set is too
exciting exhausting. I recall a little boy of seven, an only child of
particularly wise and thoughtful parents, who was brought to
me with the complaint that he exhausted himself utterly both in body and
mind by the intense nervous energy which he threw into stewards his
pursuits. For instance, he, with a riches of imaginative force, in
drawing a map of the garden his house and converting it into the likeness
of a war map, filled with imaginary to pass water. Disorders of conduct
of this sort are not really difficult to control. Suitable punishment
will succeed, provided also that the child is deprived of the sense of
satisfaction which he has in the interest which Army Corps. Such excessive
expenditure of nervous force is unusual even in older children, and as
in this case is found usually only when there is a pronounced nervous
inheritance. In little children in the nursery, solitary play or
play between themselves seldom produces nervous exhaustion. It
is quite otherwise when the child is dependent to a too great extent
upon participation of adults.

It is almost impossible for the mother and nurse not to take the
leading part in the exchange of ideas, and no matter what may had
been interested in the maps illustrating the various fronts in the
European War, still with which the walls of his father's study
were hung, and although left entirely by himself he had obtained become
intensely and exhausted by the eagerness with which he had
spent a whole morning be their good intentions, the speed set
is apt to be too great. Environment, without the intrusion of, to
gather them in their arms, to hold them on their knee, while they
stimulate their minds by a constant succession of new impressions. With
an only parent,, whose existence is the single preoccupation of the
nurse and mother, and, often enough, of the father the adult mind, is
best able to adjust the necessary stimulus and produce development, but
they should be confined within strict limits and to a definite hour in
the daily a grown person, he feels himself lost. He cannot be two years
will not play for half an hour at a time happily and busily in a room by
himself. It is an even better test if the child will play amicably
by himself with nurse or mother in the or undue attempts to attract
attention on the other. If the child is entirely dependent upon the
left alone, and yet cannot enjoy the society he craves. He grows
more and more restless, dominating the whole situation more and more,
constantly plucking at his nurse's skirts, perversely refusing every new
sensation that of is offered him to On still his restlessness for a
moment. The result of all this stimulation is mental irritability
and exhaustion, in turn is often the direct cause of refusal of food,
dyspepsia, wakefulness, and little girl dismayed her parents and
continued in spite of all they could do to prevent her to ask every
one they were about his conduct excites.

His behaviour is only of remain deaf to all the appeals of his helpless
nurse. If she tries force To-day, he quells the attempt by a storm of
crying. If she declines upon entreaty and coaxing, he will not be
persuaded. It is the little scene of the fireplace over again.

The attempts at force or the attempts at persuasion, by making much of
it cupboard door and call on him to help importance because it indicates
certain faults in his environment and a certain element of nervous unrest
and overstrain. The young child demands from his environment that it
should give him in two things--security and liberty. He must have
security from shocks to his nervous system. It is true that from the
greater shocks the children of the well-to-do are as a rule
carefully guarded. No one threatens or ill-uses them and the child who
is nervous only because he breathes constantly an atmosphere charged
with doubt. They are not terrified by drunken brawls or scenes of
passion.

They are not made fearful by the superstitions of ignorant people.
Nevertheless, by the summation of stimuli little emotions constantly
repeated can have effects no less grave upon their nervous system. From
this constantly acting irritation the child needs security. In the
second place, he requires liberty to develop his own initiative, which
should be stimulated and sustained and directed. Without liberty and
without security conduct cannot fail to become abnormal.

(_d_) THE REASONING POWER OF THE CHILD Before we proceed to a closer
examination of the various symptoms of nervous unrest in detail, we may
very briefly consider the scope and power of the child's understanding.
As a rule element am sure that it is grossly underestimated
The mental processes of the child are far ahead of his that their
attitude is always consistent. The less that is forbidden the better,
but when the line is power of speech. The capacity for understanding
speech is well advanced, and an appeal the. It is useless for the mother
to begin proceedings by trying to convince her that this not so--that
mother has a sore throat too. Such a plan only arouses apprehension,
because the child scents danger in the artifice. Closely connected
with the reasoning powers of the child is to obey doubt that far more
harm is done by an over-emphasis authority than by its neglect. If the
nurse or mother is of strong character, and the authority is exercised
persistently a grave risk pounds that he will to lie to save his
skin. I have seen a few such cases of what may call the remorseless
set of authority, and the result has not been pleasing. Fortunately,
perhaps the difficult way, the growth of obedience to reason is often
successful while the child is still powerless to express his own thoughts
in words. Because he cannot so express himself there is a tendency to
underestimate the acuteness of of the moment. A child of eighteen months
is not too young to be talked to in a quiet, straightforward, sensible
way those. Only if he is treated as a reasonable being can we expect his
reasoning faculties to develop. Children dislike intensely the unexplained
intervention of force. If a pair of scissors, left by an oversight
lie about, has been grasped, the first impulse of the mother is to
snatch the danger hurriedly from the child's hands, and her him
quietly, telling him that scissors hurt babies, she had decided to take
no notice, approached her with a troubled face:" Are be made to yield
to his own efforts, the future is black indeed importance and to imagine
that he can be imposed. From that day he sets himself to strike down
authority with a success which promote him to further efforts. I
have known a child of five years terrorise his mother and get his own
way by the threat," will go into one of my furies." The difficulty of
successfully enforcing authority, and of carrying you not angry?" he
said; a dozen times. The mind of all little children tends easily to work
in a groove. It delights in" are you not disappointed?" In reality the
naughty child is frequently only the child who has brother become
master of his mother's or his nurse's responses, and can produce
at will the effect he desires.

       The idea there that the child possesses a strong will, which and
show him where to place them out of harm's way.

Watch orphans a child at play after his midday meal. He has been
out in his perambulator half the morning, and for the other half has
been deep in his midday sleep. Now that dinner is over he is for
a moment master of his time and busily in some pursuit dear to his
heart.

At two o'clock inexorable routine ordains that he again be would scratch
the table if the cloth were not there. Within a few minutes the
child lifted the cloth, peering under it and saying," Not scratch table."
Yet how often do we find facetiously-minded persons confound their
reasoning and confuse their judgment by foolish speeches and cock-and-bull
tales, which, just because of their foolishness, seem to them well
adapted to the infant intelligence. An attempt to deceive the child is
almost always wrong, and because of our tendency to underestimate the
child's intelligence it generally fails. If a little girl has a
sore. How he enjoys it all! Watch him draw near the fire, excessive
crying. The devices by which children will attract to themselves the
attention of their elders, and which, if successful, are repeated
with an almost insane persistence, take on the most varied forms. Sometimes
the child persistently makes use of an expression, or asks questions,
which produce a pleasant stir of shocked surprise and renewed reproofs
and expostulations. One little boy shouted the word" stomachs" with
persistence for many weeks together. A the one place that is forbidden
him. He does not mean to do himself harm. He knows that it is hot and
would hurt him, but for the time being he is out of throat, and
the doctor comes to see her, she knows quite well that she is or
disobedience.

Sooner or later the child must learn, not many women have the heart
to adopt this attitude to the waywardness of little children--a waywardness
to which their whole nature compels them by pressing need to cultivate
tactile sensations, to experiment, and to is unable to take part
in any sustained conversation; most of his talking much more commonly,
the authority is exercised intermittently and capriciously, with
the result that the child's judgment is clouded and confused.

Conduct which is received indulgently or even encouraged at one moment
is sternly reprimanded at another. Every one who has the management
of little children must above all see to it, whatever the degree of
stringency in discipline which they decide to adopt, drawn it must
be adhered to. that authority is disputed, should make mothers wary
of drawing too tight a rein. The conflict between parent and child
must always be distressing and must always be accomplish prejudicial
Then to the child, whatever its outcome, whether it brings to placed in
the perambulator and wheeled forth on a fresh expedition. If the nurse
does not know will open the will leave his toys, forgetting all about
them in the joy of this new activity. If the reason for things is explained
to children they grow quick to understand quite complicated explanations.
A little girl, not yet two, was playing with her Noah's Ark on the
dining-room table with its polished. The mother interposed a cloth,
explaining that the animals him victory or defeat.
Now, dear reader, place yourself in my position.
Eleven hundred and ninety-five days it is since I began asking the Lord
for means for the building and fitting up of an Orphan House. Day by
day have I, by his grace, since that time, continued to bring this
matter before him. Without one moment's doubt, or misgiving, or
wavering, have I been enabled to trust in God for the means. From the
beginning, after I had once ascertained the will of God concerning this
work, have I been assured that he would bring it about; yea, as sure
have I been from the beginning that he would do so, as if I had already
had all the means in hand for it, or as if the house had been actually
before me, occupied by the children. But though to faith even three
years ago the whole work was accomplished, to sight there remained many
and great difficulties to be overcome. And even at the commencement of
this day there remained many difficulties in the way of means, as well
as in other respects; and therefore I was on the point of giving myself
again especially to prayer, at the very moment when I was informed that
the donor of the above-mentioned two thousand pounds had called to see
me. Now I have the means, as far as I can see, which will enable me to
meet all the expenses; and in all probability I shall have even several
hundred pounds more than are needed. Thus the Lord shows that he can and
will not only give _as much as is absolutely needed_ for his work, but
also that he can and will give _abundantly_. It is impossible to
describe the real joy I had in God when I received this sum. Or perhaps
there never seriously was such a plan? Certain it is, Daun takes camp at
Stolpen, a place known to him, one of the strongest posts
in Germany; intrenches himself to the teeth,--good rear-guard towards
Zittau and the Magazines; River and Pirna on our left flank; Loudon
strong and busy on our right flank, barring the road to Bautzen;--and
obstinately sits there, a very bad tooth in the jaw of a certain
King; not to be extracted by the best kinds of forceps and the
skilfulest art, for nearly a month to come.

Four Armies, Friedrich's, Henri's, Daun's, Zweibruck's, all within
sword-stroke of each other,--the universal Gazetteer world is on tiptoe.

But except Friedrich's eager shiftings and rubbings upon Stolpen
(west side, north, and at length northeast side), all is dead-lock,
and nothing comes of it.

Friedrich has his food convenient from Dresden; but a road to Bautzen
withal is what he cannot do without;--and there lies the sorrow, and
the ACHING, as this tooth knows well, and this jaw well! Harsch and
Deville are busy upon Neisse, have Neisse under blockade, perhaps
upon Kosel too, for some time past, [Neisse "blockaded more and more"
since August 4th (Kosel still earlier, but only by Pandour people); not
completely so till September 30th, or even till October 26th:
_Helden-Geschichte,_ v.
268-270.] and are carting the siege-stock to begin bombardment: a
road to Silesia, before very long, Friedrich must and will have.

       Friedrich's operations on Daun in this post are patiently artful,
and curious to look upon, but beyond description here: enough to
say, that in the second week he makes his people hut themselves
(weather wet and bad); and in the fourth week, finding that nothing
contrivable would provoke Daun into fighting,--he loads at Dresden
provisions for I think nine days; makes, from two or from three
sides, a sudden spurt upon Loudon, who is Daun's northern outpost;
brushes Loudon hastily away; and himself takes the road for Bautzen,
by Daun's right flank, thrown bare in this manner.

[Tempelhof, ii. 278.]
Road for Bautzen; which is the road for Zittau withal, for Daun's
bread-basket, as well as for Neisse and Harsch! Nine days' provision;
that is our small outfit, that and our own right-hands; and the
waste world lies all ahead.
From May 26, 1848, to May 26, 1850, were spent £2,574, 16s. 6d. of the
funds of the Institution for missionary objects, whereby forty
preachers of the gospel in British Guiana, the East Indies, Switzerland,
France, Germany, Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and England, were assisted.

The reader will notice how greatly this object of the Institution was
increased during the last four years previous to May 26, 1850. This
arose from the fact that, in the early part of 1846, the need of certain
brethren who labored in the word and doctrine came before me, and God
laid them on my heart to labor for them in prayer, in order that I might
obtain means from him for such brethren to a greater extent than I had
done before. Ever since then the Lord has been pleased increasingly to
use me in this way. For from May 26, 1846, to May 26, 1848, there was
spent for that object nearly three times as much as during any former
period of the same length; and during the period from May 26, 1848, to
May 26, 1850, I was not only allowed to do as much as before, but to
expend even £1,016, 5s. more than during the former period,
notwithstanding all the many heavy additional expenses for the various
other objects of the Institution.

It is my sweet privilege to state that the labors of many of these forty
servants of the Lord, whom I assisted, were especially owned of God
during these two years. There took place very many conversions through
their instrumentality.

From May 26, 1848, to May 26, 1850, the sum of £184, 9s. 4½d. was
expended on the circulation of tracts. There were circulated during this
period 130,464 tracts. The total number which was circulated from Nov.
19, 1840, up to May 26, 1850, amounted to 294,128.

From July 24, 1849, up to May 26, 1850, altogether 170 orphans were
received, from ten months old and upwards. On May 26, 1850, there were,
therefore, 275 orphans in the new Orphan House; and with the teachers,
overseers, nurses, and in-door and out-door servants, etc., the whole
number of persons connected with the establishment was 308. The total
number of orphans who were under our care from April, 1836, up to May
26, 1850, was 443.

_Without any one having been personally applied to for anything by me_,
the sum of £33,868, 11s. 1¼d. was given to me for the orphans, _as
the result of prayer to God_, from the commencement of the work up to
May 26, 1850. It may be also interesting to the reader to know that the
total amount which was given as free contributions, for the other
objects, from the commencement of the work up to May 26, 1850, amounted
to £10,531, 3s. 3¾d.; and that which came in by the sale of Bibles
and tracts, and by the payments of the children in the schools, up to
May 26, 1850, amounted to £2,707, 9s. 3½d.

The total of the current expenses for the orphans from May 26, 1848, to
May 26, 1849, was £1,559, 6s. 9d., and the total of the current expenses
for them from May 26, 1849, to May 26, 1850, was only £2,665, 13s.
2¾d., _i. e._ only about £1,100 more than the previous year.

As to matters connected with my own personal affairs, from May 26, 1848,
to May 26, 1850:--

Dec. 31, 1848. During this year the Lord was pleased to give me £474,
17s. 7d. To this is again to be added, for this year also, as before
stated, the free education of my daughter at a boarding-school, worth at
least £50.

Dec. 31, 1849. The Lord sent me, during the past year, £413, 2s. 4d.


CHAPTER XX.

A NEW VICTORY OF FAITH.

1850-1851.

    PAST MERCIES AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO NEW UNDERTAKINGS--A HOUSE FOR
    SEVEN HUNDRED ORPHANS PROPOSED--WALKING BY FAITH--COUNSEL SOUGHT
    FROM GOD--THE PURPOSE FORMED--DELIGHT IN THE MAGNITUDE AND
    DIFFICULTY OF THE DESIGN.


December 5, 1850. It is now sixteen years and nine months this evening
since I began the Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad.
This Institution was in its beginning exceedingly small. Now it is so
large that I have not only disbursed, since its commencement, about
fifty thousand pounds sterling, but that also the current expenses,
after the rate of the last months, amount to above six thousand pounds a
year. I did "open my mouth wide," this very evening fifteen years ago,
and the Lord has filled it. The new Orphan House is now inhabited by
three hundred orphans; and there are altogether three hundred and
thirty-five persons connected with it. My labor is abundant. The
separation from my dear wife and child is great, on account of my being
the greater part of the day at the new Orphan House; sometimes also by
night. But notwithstanding all this, I have again and again thought
about laboring more than ever in serving poor orphans. Within the last
ten days this matter has much occupied my mind, and for the last five
days I have had much prayer about it. It has passed through my mind to
build another Orphan House, large enough for seven hundred orphans, so
that I might be able to care for one thousand altogether. The points
which have led me to this thought are: 1. The many distressing cases of
children, bereaved of _both_ parents, who have no helper. I have
received two hundred and seven orphans within the last sixteen months,
and have now seventy-eight waiting for admission, without having
vacancies for any. I had about sixty children waiting for admission
about sixteen months since, so about two hundred and thirty children
have been applied for within these sixteen months. But, humanly
speaking, for the next sixteen months the number of applications will be
far greater, as the work is now so much more widely known; except it be
that persons may hear that the new Orphan House is quite full, and on
that account may consider it useless to apply. 2. Even on those terrible
terms, the Prussians, by dams, by footpaths, sometimes one man abreast,
sprawl steadily forward, trailing their cannon with them; only a few
regiments, in the footpath parts, cannot bring their cannon. Forward;
rank again, when the ground will carry; ever forward, the case-shot
getting ever more murderous! No human pen can describe the deadly
chaos which ensued in that quarter. Which lasted, in desperate
fury, issue dubious, for above three hours; and was the crisis, or
essential agony, of the Battle. Foot-chargings, (once the mud-transit was
accomplished), under storms of grape-shot from Homoly Hill; by and
by, Horse-chargings, Prussian against Austrian, southward of Homoly
and Sterbohol, still farther to the Prussian left; huge whirlpool of
tumultuous death-wrestle, every species of spasmodic effort, on the
one side and the other;--King himself present there, as I dimly discover;
Feldmarschall Browne eminent, in the last of his fields; and, as the
old NIEBELUNGEN has it, "a murder grim and great" going on.

Schwerin's Prussians, in that preliminary struggle through the mud-tanks
(which Winterfeld, I think, had happened to skirt, and avoid), were
hard bested. This, so far as I can learn, was the worst of the chaos,
this preliminary part. Intolerable to human nature, this, or nearly
so; even to human nature of the Platt-Teutsch type, improved by
Prussian drill.
Winterfeld's repulse we saw; Schwerin's own Regiment in it. Various
repulses, I perceive, there were,--"fresh regiments from our Second
Line" storming in thereupon; till the poor repulsed people "took
breath," repented, "and themselves stormed in again," say the Books.
Fearful tugging, swagging and swaying is conceivable, in this Sterbohol
problem! And after long scanning, I rather judge it was in the wake of
that first repulse, and not of some other farther on, that the
veteran Schwerin himself got his death. No one times it for us; but the
fact is unforgettable; and in the dim whirl of sequences, dimly
places itself there. Very certain it is, "at sight of his own
regiment in retreat," Feldmarschall Schwerin seized the colors,--as did
other Generals, who are not named, that day. Seizes the colors, fiery
old man: "HERAN, MEINE KINDER (This way, my sons)!" and rides ahead,
along the straight dam again; his "sons" all turning, and with
hot repentance following. "On, my children, HERAN!" Five bits of
grape-shot, deadly each of them, at once hit the old man; dead he sinks
there on his flag; and will never fight more. "HERAN!" storm the
others with hot tears; Adjutant von Platen takes the flag; Platen, too,
is instantly shot; but another takes it. "HERAN, On!" in wild storm of
rage and grief:--in a word, they manage to do the work at Sterbohol,
they and the rest. First line, Second line, Infantry, Cavalry (and
even the very Horses, I suppose), fighting inexpressibly; conquering
one of the worst problems ever seen in War.

For the Austrians too, especially their grenadiers there, stood to it
toughly, and fought like men;--and "every grenadier that survived
of them," as I read afterwards, "got double pay for life."
Done, that Sterbohol work;--those Foot-chargings, Horse-chargings; that
battery of Homoly Hill; and, hanging upon that, all manner of
redoubts and batteries to the rightward and rearward:--but how it was
done no pen can describe, nor any intellect in clear sequence understand.
An enormous MELEE there: new Prussian battalions charging, and ever
new, irrepressible by case-shot, as they successively get up;
Marshal Browne too sending for new battalions at double-quick from
his left, disputing stiffly every inch of his ground. Till at length
(hour not given), a cannon-shot tore away his foot; and he had to
be carried into Prag, mortally wounded.

Which probably was a most important circumstance, or the most important
of all.

Important too, I gradually see, was that of the Prussian Horse of the
Left Wing. Prussian Horse of the extreme left, as already noticed, had,
in the mean while, fallen in, well southward, round by certain lakelets
about Michelup, on Browne's extreme right; furiously charging the
Austrian Horse, which stood ranked there in many lines; breaking
it, then again half broken by it; but again rallying, charging it
a second time, then a third time, "both to front and flank, amid
whirlwinds of dust" (Ziethen busy there, not to mention indignant
Warnery and others);--and at length, driving it wholly to the winds:
"beyond Nussel, towards the Sazawa Country;" never seen again that
day.

Prince Karl (after Browne's death-wound, or before, I never know) came
galloping to rally that important Right Wing of horse. Prince Karl did
his very utmost there; obtesting, praying, raging, threatening:--but
to no purpose; the Zietheners and others so heavy on the rear of
them:--and at last there came a cramp, or intolerable twinge of
spasm, through Prince Karl's own person (breast or heart), like to
take the life of him: so that he too had to be carried into Prag
to the doctors.

And his Cavalry fled at discretion; chased by Ziethen, on Friedrich's
express order, and sent quite over the horizon. Enough, "by about
half-past one," Sterbohol work is thoroughly done: and the Austrian
Battle, both its Commanders gone, has heeled fairly downwards, and is
in an ominous way.

The whole of this Austrian Right Wing, horse and foot, batteries and
redoubts, which was put EN POTENCE, or square-wise, to the main
battle, is become a ruin; gone to confusion; hovers in distracted
clouds, seeking roads to run away by, which it ultimately found.

Done all this surely was; and poor Browne, mortally wounded, is being
carried off the ground; but in what sequence done, under what exact
vicissitudes of aspect, special steps of cause and effect, no man can
say; and only imagination, guided by these few data, can paint to
itself. Such a chaotic whirlwind of blood, dust, mud, artillery-thunder,
sulphurous rage, and human death and victory,--who shall pretend to
describe it, or draw, except in the gross, the scientific plan
of it?

For, in the mean time,--I think while the dispute at Sterbohol, on
the extreme of the Austrian right wing "in joiner's-square form," was
past the hottest (but nobody will give the hour),--there has occurred
another thing, much calculated to settle that. And, indeed, to settle
everything;--as it did. This was a volunteer exploit, upon the very
elbow or angle of said "joiner's-square;" in the wet grounds between
Hlaupetin and Kyge, a good way north of Sterbohol. Volunteer exploit;
on the part of General Mannstein, our old Russian friend; which
Friedrich, a long way off from it, blames as a rash fault of Mannstein's,
made good by Prince Henri and Ferdinand of Brunswick running up
to mend it; but which Winterfeld, and subsequent good judges, admit
to have been highly salutary, and to have finished everything. It went,
if I read right, somewhat as follows.

In the Kyge-Hlaupetin quarter, at the corner of that Austrian
right wing EN POTENCE, there had, much contrary to Browne's intention,
a perceptible gap occurred; the corner is open there; nothing in it but
batteries and swamps. The Austrian right wing, wheeling southward,
there to form POTENCE; and scrambling and marching, then and subsequently,
through such ground at double-quick, had gone too far (had thinned
and lengthened itself, as is common, in such scrambling, and
double-quick movement, thinks Tempelhof), and left a little gap at
elbow; which always rather widened as the stress at Sterbohol went
on.

Certain enough, a gap there is, covered only by some half-moon battery
in advance: into this, General Mannstein has been looking wistfully a
long time: "Austrian Line fallen out at elbow yonder; clouted by some
battery in advance?"--and at length cannot help dashing loose on it
with his Division. A man liable to be rash, and always too impetuous
in battle-time.

He would have fared ill, thinks Friedrich, had not Henri and Ferdinand,
in pain for Mannstein (some think, privately in preconcert with him),
hastened in to help; and done it altogether in a shining way; surmounting
perilous difficulties not a few. Hard fighting in that corner, partly
on the Sterbohol terms; batteries, mud-tanks; chargings, rechargings:
"Comrades, you have got honor enough, KAMERADEN, IHR HABT EHRE GENUG
[the second man of you lying dead]; let us now try!" said a certain
Regiment to a certain other, in this business. [Archenholtz, i.
75; Tempelhof, &c.] Prince Henri shone especially, the gallant little
gentleman: coming upon one of those mud-tanks with battery beyond, his
men were spreading file-wise, to cross it on the dams; "BURSCHE, this
way!" cried the Prince, and plunged in middle-deep, right upon the battery;
and over it, and victoriously took possession of it. In a word,
they all plunge forward, in a shining manner; rush on those half-moon
batteries, regardless of results; rush over them, seize and secure
them.
Rush, in a word, fairly into that Austrian hole-at-elbow, torrents more
following them,--and irretrievably ruin both fore-arm and shoulder-arm
of the Austrians thereby.

Fore-arm (Austrian right wing, if still struggling and wriggling about
Sterbohol) is taken in flank; shoulder-arm, or main line, the like; we
have them both in flank; with their own batteries to scour them to
destruction here:--the Austrian Line, throughout, is become a ruin.
Has to hurl itself rapidly to rightwards, to rearwards, says Tempelhof,
behind what redoubts and strong points it may have in those parts; and
then, by sure stages (Tempelhof guesses three, or perhaps four), as one
redoubt after another is torn from the loose grasp of it, and the stand
made becomes ever weaker, and the confusion worse,--to roll pell-mell
into Prag, and hastily close the door behind it. The Prussians,
Sterbohol people, Mannstein-Henri people, left wing and right, are
quite across the Zisca Back, on by Nussel (Prince Earl's head-quarter
that was), and at the Moldau Brink again, when the thing ends. Ziethen's
Hussars have been at Nussel, very busy plundering there, ever since
that final charge and chase from Sterbohol. Plundering; and, I am ashamed
to say, mostly drunk: "Your Majesty, I cannot rank a hundred sober,"
answered Ziethen (doubtless with a kind of blush), when the King applied
for them. The King himself has got to Branik, farther up stream.
Part of the Austrian foot fled, leftwards, southwards, as their right
wing of horse had all done, up the Moldau. About 16,000 Austrians
are distractedly on flight that way. Towards, the Sazawa Country; to
unite with Daun, as the now advisable thing. Near 40,000 of them are
getting crammed into Prag; in spite of Prince Karl, now recovered of
his cramp, and risen to the frantic pitch; who vainly struggles at the
Gate against such inrush, and had even got through the Gate,
conjuring and commanding, but was himself swum in again by those
panic torrents of ebb-tide.

Rallying within, he again attempted, twice over, at two different points,
to get out, and up the Moldau, with his broken people; but the Prussians,
Nussel-Branik way, were awake to him: "No retreat up the Moldau for
you, Austrian gentlemen!" They tried by another Gate, on the
other side of the River; but Keith was awake too: "In again, ye Austrian
gentlemen! Closed gates here too. What else?" Browne, from his bed of
pain (death-bed, as it proved), was for a much more determined outrush:

"In the dead of night, rank, deliberately adjust yourselves; storm
out, one and all, and cut your way, night favoring!" That was Browne's
last counsel; but that also was not taken. A really noble Browne, say
all judges; died here in about six weeks,--and got away from Kriegs-Hofraths
and Prince Karls, and the stupidity of neighbors, and the other
ills that flesh is heir to, altogether.

At Branik the victorious King had one great disappointment: Prince Moritz
of Dessau, who should have been here long hours ago, with Keith's right
wing, a fresh 15,000, to fall upon the enemy's rear;--no Moritz visible;
not even now, when the business is to chase! "How is this?" "Ill luck,
your Majesty!" Moritz's Pontoon Bridge would not reach across, when
he tried it. That is certain: "just three poor pontoons wanting,"
Rumor says:--three or more; spoiled, I am told, in some narrow road,
some short-cut which Moritz had commanded for them: and now they are
not; and it is as if three hundred had been spoiled. Moritz, would he
die for it, cannot get his Bridge to reach: his fresh 15,000 stand
futile there; not even Seidlitz with his light horse could really
swim across, though he tried hard, and is fabled to have done so. Beware
of short-cuts, my Prince: your Father that is gone, what would he say
of you here! It was the worst mistake Prince Moritz ever made. The
Austrian Army might have been annihilated, say judges (of a sanguine
temper), had Moritz been ready, at his hour, to fall on from
rearward;--and where had their retreat been? As it is, the Austrian Army
is not annihilated; only bottled into Prag, and will need sieging.
The brightest triumph has a bar of black in it, and might always have
been brighter. Here is a flying Note, which I will subjoin:--
Friedrich's dispositions for the Battle, this day, are allowed to have
been masterly; but there was one signal fault, thinks Retzow: That
he did not, as Schwerin counselled, wait till the morrow.

Fault which brought many in the train of it; that of his "tired soldiers,"
says Retzow, being only a first item, and small in comparison.
"Had he waited till the morrow, those fish-ponds of Sterbohol, examined
in the interim, need not have been mistaken for green meadows; Prince
Moritz, with his 15,000, would have been a fact, instead of a false hope;
the King might have done his marching down upon Sterbohol in the night-time,
and been ready for the Austrians, flank, or even rear, at daybreak: the
King might"--In reality, this fault seems to have been considerable; to
have made the victory far more costly to him, and far less complete. No
doubt he had his reasons for making haste: Daun, advancing Prag-ward with
30,000, was within three marches of him; General Beck, Daun's vanguard,
with a 10,000 of irregulars, did a kind of feat at Brandeis, on the
Prussian post there (our Saxons deserting to him, in the heat of
action), this very day, May 6th; and might, if lucky, have taken part
at Ziscaberg next day. And besides these solid reasons, there was perhaps
another. Retzow, who is secretly of the Opposition-party, and well worth
hearing, knows personally a curious thing. He says:--
"Being then [in March or April, weeks before we left Saxony] employed
to translate the PLAN OF OPERATIONS into French, for Marshal Keith's
use, who did not understand German, I well know that it contained
the following three main objects: 1.

'All Regiments cantoning in Silesia as well as Saxony march for Bohemia
on one and the same day. 2. Whole Army arrives at Prag May 4th [Schwerin
was a day later, and got scolded in consequence]; if the Enemy stand,
he is attacked May 6th, and beaten.
3. So soon as Prag is got, Schwerin, with the gross of the Army,
pushes into Mahren,' and the heart of Austria itself; 'King hastens
with 40,000 to help of the Allied Army,'"--Royal Highness of Cumberland's;
who will much need it by that time! [Retzow, i. 84 n.]
Here is a very curious fact and consideration. That the King had so
prophesied and preordained: "May 4th, Four Columns arrive at Prag; May
6th, attack the Austrians, beat them,"--and now wished to keep his
word!
This is an aerial reason, which I can suspect to have had its weight
among others. There were twirls of that kind in Friedrich; intricate
weak places; knots in the sound straight-fibred mind he had (as
in whose mind are they not?)

,--which now and then cost him dear! The Anecdote-Books say he was very
ill of body, that day, May 6th; and called for something of drug
nature, and swallowed it (drug not named), after getting on horseback.
The Evening Anecdote is prettier: How, in the rushing about, Austrians
now flying, he got eye on Brother Henri (clayey to a degree); and
sat down with him, in the blessed sunset, for a minute or two, and bewailed
his sad losses of Schwerin and others.

Certain it is, the victory was bought by hard fighting; and but for
the quality of his troops, had not been there. But the bravery of
the Prussians was exemplary, and covered all mistakes that were made.
Nobler fire, when did it burn in any Army? More perfect soldiers I have
not read of. Platt-Teutsch fire--which I liken to anthracite, in
contradistinction to Gaelic blaze of kindled straw--is thrice noble,
when, by strict stern discipline, you are above it withal; and wield
your fire-element, as Jove his thunder, by rule! Otherwise it is but
half-admirable: Turk-Janissaries have it otherwise; and it comes to
comparatively little.

This is the famed Battle of Prag; fought May 6th, 1757; which
sounded through all the world,--and used to deafen us in drawing-rooms
within man's memory.

Results of it were: On the Prussian side, killed, wounded and missing,
12,500 men; on the Austrian, 13,000 (prisoners included), with
many flags, cannon, tents, much war-gear gone the wrong road;--and a
very great humiliation and dispiritment; though they had fought well:
"No longer the old Austrians, by any means," as Friedrich sees;
but have iron ramrods, all manner of Prussian improvements, and are
"learning to march," as he once says, with surprise not quite
pleasant.

Friedrich gives the cipher of loss, on both sides, much higher: "This
Battle," says he, "which began towards nine in the morning, and
lasted, chase included, till eight at night, was one of the bloodiest
of the age. The Enemy lost 24,000 men, of whom were 5,000 prisoners; the
Prussian loss amounted to 18,000 fighting men,--without counting Marshal
Schwerin, who alone was worth above 10,000." "This day saw the pillars
of the Prussian Infantry cut down," says he mournfully, seeming
almost to think the "laurels of victory" were purchased too dear.

His account of the Battle, as if it had been a painful object, rather
avoided in his after-thoughts, is unusually indistinct;--and helps
us little in the extreme confusion that reigns otherwise,
both in the thing itself and in the reporters of the thing. Here
is a word from Winterfeld, some private Letter, two days after; which is
well worth reading for those who would understand this Battle.

"The enemy had his Left Wing leaning on the City, close by the Moldau,"
at Nussel; "and stretched with his Right Wing across the high Hill [of
Zisca] to the village of Lieben [so he HAD stood, looking into Prag;
but faced about, on hearing that Friedrich was across the River];
having before him those terrible Defiles [DIE TERRIBLEN DEFILEES,
"Horse-shoe of the Moldau," as we call it], and the village of
Prossik, which was crammed with Pandours.

It was about half-past six in the morning, when our Schwerin Army [myself
part of it, at this time] joined with the twenty battalions and twenty
squadrons, which the King had brought across to unite with us, and which
formed our right wing of battle that day [our left wing were Schweriners,
Sterbohol and the fighting done by Schweriners after their long march].
The King was at once determined to attack the Enemy; as also were
Schwerin [say nothing of the arguing] and your humble servant (MEINE
WENIGKEIT): but the first thing was, to find a hole whereby to get at
him.

"This too was selected, and decided on, my proposal being found
good; and took effect in manner following: We [Schweriners] had marched
off left-wise, foremost; and we now, without halt, continued marching so
with the Left Wing" of horse, "which had the van (TETE); and moved on,
keeping the road for Hlaupetin, and ever thence onwards along for
Kyge, round the Ponds of Unter-Podschernitz, without needing to pass
these, and so as to get them in our rear.

"The Enemy, who at first had expected nothing bad, and never supposed
that we would attack him at once, FLAGRANTE DELICTO, and least of
all in this point; and did not believe it possible, as we
should have to wade, breast-deep in part, through the ditches,
and drag our cannon,--was at first quite tranquil. But as he began to
perceive our real design (in which, they say, Prince Karl was the first
to open Marshal Browne's eyes), he drew his whole Cavalry over towards
us, as fast as it could be done, and stretched them out as Right Wing;
to complete which, his Grenadiers and Hungarian Regulars of Foot ranked
themselves as they got up [makes his POTENCE, HAKEN, or joiner's-square,
outmost end of it Horse.]
"The Enemy's intention was to hold with the Right Wing of his infantry
on the Farmstead which they call Sterbaholy [Sterbohol, a very dirty
Farmstead at this day]; I, however, had the good luck, plunging on, head
foremost, with six battalions of our Left Wing and two of the Flank,
to get to it before him.

Although our Second Line was not yet come forward, yet, as the battalions
of the First were tolerably well together, I decided, with General
Fouquet, who had charge of the Flank, to begin at once; and, that the
Enemy might not have time to post himself still better, I pushed forward,
quick step, out of the Farmstead" of Sterbohol "to meet him,--so fast,
that even our cannon had not time to follow. He did, accordingly, begin
to waver; and I could observe that his people here, on this Wing, were
making right-about.

"Meanwhile, his fire of case-shot opened [from Homoly Hill, on our
left], and we were still pushing on,--might now be about two hundred
steps from the Enemy's Line, when I had the misfortune, at the head
of Regiment Schwerin, to get wounded, and, swooning away (VOR TOD), fell
from my horse to the ground. Awakening after some minutes, and raising
my head to look about, I found nobody of our people now here beside or
round me; but all were already behind, in full flood of retreat
(HOCH ANSCHLAGEN). The Enemy's Grenadiers were perhaps eighty paces from
me; but had halted, and had not the confidence to follow us. I
struggled to my feet, as fast as, for weakness, I possibly could; and got
up to our confused mass [CONFUSEN KLUMPEN,--exact place, where?]:
but could not, by entreaties or by threats, persuade a single man
of them to turn his face on the Enemy, much less to halt and try again.

"In this embarrassment the deceased Feldmarschall found me, and noticed
that the blood was flowing stream-wise from my neck. As I was on foot,
and none of my people now near, he bade give me his led horse which he
still had [and sent me home for surgery? Winterfeld, handsomely effacing
himself when no longer good for anything, hurries on to the Catastrophe,
leaving us to guess that he was NOT an eye-witness farther]--bade give
me the led horse which he still had; AND [as if that had happened
directly after, which surely it did not? AND] snatched the flag from
Captain Rohr, who had taken it up to make the Bursche turn, and rode
forward with it himself.' But before he could succeed in the attempt,
this excellent man, almost in a minute, was hit with five case-shot
balls, and fell dead on the ground; as also his brave Adjutant von
Platen was so wounded that he died next day.

"During this confusion and repulse, by which, as already mentioned, the
Enemy had not the heart to profit, not only was our Second Line come
on, but those of the First, who had not suffered, went vigorously
(FRISCH) at the Enemy,"--and in course of time (perhaps two hours yet),
and by dint of effort, we did manage Sterbohol and its batteries:--"Like
as [still in one sentence, and without the least punctuation; Winterfeld
being little of a grammarian, and in haste for the close], Like as
Prince Henri's Royal Highness with our Right Wing," Mannstein and he,
"without waiting for order, attacked so PROMPT and with such FERMOTE,"
in that elbow-hole far north of US, "that everywhere the Enemy's Line
began to give way; and instead of continuing as Line, sought corps-wise
to gain the Heights, and there post itself. And as, without winning said
Heights, we could not win the Battle, we had to storm them all, one after
the other; and this it was that cost us the best, most and bravest
people.
"The late Colonel von Goltz [if we glance back to Sterbohol itself],
who, with the regiment Fouquet, was advancing, right-hand of Schwerin
regiment" and your servant, "had likewise got quite close to the
Enemy; and had he not, at the very instant when he was levelling
bayonets, been shot down, I think that he, with myself and the
Schwerin regiment, would have got in,"--and perhaps have there done
the job, special and general, with much less expense, and sooner!Instead of this, however, I looked in no degree whatever at things
according to my natural fallen reason, and I trusted not in the circle
of my Christian friends, but in the living God; and the result has been
that there have been since 1834 ten thousand souls under our instruction
in the various day schools, Sunday schools, and adult schools; several
hundred orphans have been brought up, and many of them from their very
tenderest infancy; several hundred thousand tracts and many thousand
copies of the Word of God have been circulated; about forty preachers of
the gospel at home and abroad have been, for several years, assisted in
connection with the Scriptural Knowledge Institution; and a house has
been built and fitted up for the accommodation of three hundred
destitute orphans, each of whom has neither father nor mother. How
blessed therefore is it to trust in God, and in him alone, and not in
circumstances nor friends! There is, however, one thing which I must
record here, because it has taken place since I last wrote in my journal
on this subject, on January 2. It is this. During these twelve days I
have received for the various objects of the Scriptural Knowledge
Institution, in smaller donations, sixty-four pounds fifteen shillings
sixpence two farthings, also a donation of one hundred and fifty pounds,
and one of three thousand pounds. Is not this a plain proof that God is
both able and willing to help simply in answer to prayer? Is not human
reason confounded by such instances? When I first began to write these
exercises of my mind about another Orphan House, I knew not that on
January 4, I should receive a donation of three thousand pounds; yet I
was fully assured that God was able to support one thousand orphans as
easily as he did the thirty whom I first received in a rented house.
Does he not, however, tell me by all this, Go forward, my servant, and I
will help thee?

7. But, it might be said, suppose you were able by prayer to obtain this
large sum for building a house for seven hundred other orphans; and
suppose you were able to provide for them during your lifetime,--what
would become of this Institution after your death? Daun had his Camp

on this subject in my journal, thirty more orphans have been applied

aspects, this book may serve as an introduction.

It deals with the influences which mould the mentality of the child
and shape his conduct. Extreme susceptibility to these influences
is the mark of the nervous child.

I have to thank the Editors of _The Practitioner_ and of _The Child_,
respectively, for permission to reprint the chapters which deal with
"Enuresis" and "The Nervous Child in Sickness." To Dr. F.H. Dodd I should
also like to offer thanks for helpful suggestions.

THE NERVOUS CHILD
CHAPTER I
DOCTORS, MOTHERS, AND CHILDREN

There is an old fairy story concerning a pea which a princess once slept
upon--a little offending pea, a minute disturbance, a trifling departure
from the normal which grew to the proportions of intolerable
suffering because of the too sensitive and undisciplined nervous
system of Her Royal Highness.

The story, I think, does not tell us much else concerning the princess.
It does not tell us, for instance, if she was an only child, the sole
preoccupation of her parents and nurses, surrounded by the most anxious
care, reared with some difficulty because of her extraordinary
"delicacy," suffering from a variety of illnesses which somehow
always seemed to puzzle the doctors, though some of the symptoms--the
vomiting, for example, and the high temperature--were very severe
and persistent. Nor does it tell us if later in life, but before the
suffering from the pea arose, she had been taken to consult two famous
doctors, one of whom had removed the vermiform appendix, while the
other a little later had performed an operation for "adhesions."
At any rate, the story with these later additions, which are at least
in keeping with what we know of her history, would serve to indicate
the importance which attaches to the early training of childhood.

Among the children even of the well-to-do often enough the hygiene
of the mind is overlooked, and faulty management produces restlessness,
instability, and hyper-sensitiveness, which pass insensibly into neuropathy
in adult life.

To prevent so distressing a result is our aim in the training of children.
No doubt the matter concerns in the first place parents and
nurses, school masters and mistresses, as well as medical men. Yet because
of the certainty that physical disturbances of one sort or another
will follow upon nervous unrest, it will seldom happen that medical
advice will not be sought sooner or later; and if the physician is to
intervene with success, he must be prepared with knowledge of many sorts.
He must be prepared to make a thorough and complete physical examination,
sufficient to exclude the presence of organic disease. If no organic
disease is found, he must explore the whole environment of the
child, and seek to determine whether the exciting cause is to be found
in the reaction of the child to some form of faulty management.

For example, a child of two or three years of age may be brought to the
doctor with the complaint that defæcation is painful, and that there
has existed for some time a most distressing constipation which has
resisted a large number of purgatives of increasing strength.
Whenever the child is placed upon the stool, his crying at once begins,
and no attempts to soothe or console him have been successful.
It is not sufficient for the doctor in such a case to make an examination
which convinces him that there is no fissure at the anus and no
fistula or thrombosed pile, and to confine himself to saying that
he can find nothing the matter.

The crying and refusal to go to stool will continue after the visit as
before, and the mother will be apt to conclude that her doctor, though
she has the greatest confidence in him for the ailments of grown-up
persons, is unskilled in, or at least not interested in, the diseases
of little children.
If, on the other hand, the doctor pursues his inquiries into the
management of the child in the home, and if, for example, he finds that
the crying and resistance is not confined to going to stool, but also
takes place when the child is put to bed, and very often at meal-times
as well, then it will be safe for him to conclude that all the symptoms
are due to the same cause--a sort of "negativism" which is apt to appear
in all children who are directed and urged too much, and whose parents
are not careful to hide from them the anxiety and distress which their
conduct occasions.

If this diagnosis is made, then a full and clear explanation should
be given to the mother, or at any rate to such mothers--and fortunately
they are in the majority--who are capable of appreciating the point of
psychology involved, and of correcting the management of the child
so as to overcome the negativism. To attempt treatment by prescribing
drugs, or in any other way than by correcting the faulty management, is
to court failure. As Charcot has said, in functional disorders it is not
so much the prescription which matters as the prescriber.

But the task of the doctor is often one of even greater difficulty.

Often enough there will be a combination of organic disturbance with
functional trouble. For example, a girl of eighteen years old suffered
from a pain in the left arm which has persisted on and off since the
olecranon had been fractured when she was two years of age. She was the
youngest of a large family, and had never been separated for a day
from the care and apprehensions of her mother.

The joint was stiff, and there was considerable deformity. The pain
always increased when she was tired or unhappy. Again, a girl had some
slight cystitis with frequent micturition, and this passed by slow
degrees into a purely functional irritability of the bladder, which
called for micturition at frequent intervals both by day and night.
In such cases treatment must endeavour to control both factors--the local
organic disturbance must if possible be removed, and the faults of
management corrected.

It is a good physician who can appreciate and estimate accurately the
temperament of his patient, and the need for this insight is nowhere
greater than in dealing with the disorders of childhood. It can be
acquired only by long practice and familiarity with children. In
the hospital wards we shall learn much that is essential, but we shall
not learn this.

The child, who is so sensitive to his environment, shows but little
that is characteristic when admitted to an institution.
Only in the nursery can we learn to estimate the influences which proceed
from parents and nurses of different characters and temperaments, and the
reaction which is produced by them in the child.

The body of the child is moulded and shaped by the environment in which
it grows. Pure air, a rational diet, free movement, give strength and
symmetry to every part. Faults of hygiene debase the type, although
the type is determined by heredity which in the individual is
beyond our control.

Mothers and nurses to-day are well aware of the need for a rational
hygiene. Mother-craft is studied zealously and with success, and there
is no lack of books to give sound guidance and to show the mean
between the dangerous extremes of coddling and a too Spartan exposure.
Yet sometimes it has seemed as if some mothers whose care for their
children's physical health is most painstaking, who have nothing
to learn on the question of diet, of exercise, of fresh air, or of
baths, who measure and weigh and record with great minuteness, have
had their attention so wholly occupied with the care of the body
that they do not appreciate the simultaneous growth of the mind,
or inquire after its welfare.

Yet it is the astounding rapidity with which the mental processes develop
that forms the distinguishing characteristic of the infancy of man.
Were it not for this rapid growth of the cerebral functions, the
rearing of children would be a matter almost as simple and uneventful
as the rearing of live stock.

For most animals faults of environment must be very pronounced to do
harm by producing mental unrest and irritability. Thus, indeed, some
wild animal separated from its fellows and kept in solitary captivity
may sicken and waste, though maintained and fed with every care.

Yet if the whole conditions of life for the animal are not profoundly
altered, if the environment is natural or approximately natural, it is
as a rule necessary to care only for its physical needs, and we need not
fear that the results will be spoiled by the reaction of the mind
upon the body.

But with the child it is different; airy nurseries, big gardens, visits
to the seaside, and every advantage that money can buy cannot achieve
success if the child's mind is not at rest, if his sleep is broken, if
food is habitually refused or vomited, or if to leave him alone in the
nursery for a moment is to evoke a fit of passionate crying.

The grown-up person comes eventually to be able to control this tremendous
organ, this brain, which is the predominant feature of his race. In
the child its functions are always unstable and liable to be upset.
Evidence of mental unrest or fatigue, which is only rarely met with
in grown persons and which then betokens serious disturbance of the mind,
is of comparatively common occurrence in little children.
Habit spasm, bed-wetting, sleep-walking, night terrors, and convulsions
are symptoms which are frequent enough in children, and there is no
need to be unduly alarmed at their occurrence. In adult age they are
found only among persons who must be considered as neuropathic. To make
the point clear, I have chosen examples from the graver and more serious
symptoms of nervous unrest. But it is equally true that minor
symptoms which in adults are universally recognised to be dependent
upon cerebral unrest or fatigue are of everyday occurrence in childhood.
Broken and disturbed sleep, absence of appetite and persistent refusal
of food, gastric pain and discomfort after meals, nervous vomiting,
morbid flushing and blushing, headache, irritability and excessive
emotional display, at whatever age they occur, are indications of
a mind that is not at rest. In children, as in adults, they may be
prominent although the physical surroundings of the patient may
be all that could be desired and all that wealth can procure.

It is an everyday experience that business worries and responsibilities
in men, domestic anxieties or childlessness in women, have the power
to ruin health, even in those who habitually or grossly break none
of its laws.

The unstable mind of the child is so sensitive that cerebral fatigue
and irritability are produced by causes which seem to us extraordinarily
trivial.

In the little life which the child leads, a life in which the whole
seems to us to be comprised in dressing and undressing, washing,
walking, eating, sleeping, and playing, it is not easy to detect
where the elements of nervous overstrain lie.

    Nor is it as a rule in these things that the mischief is to be
    found. It is in the personality of mother or nurse,
    in her conduct to the child, in her actions and words, in the
    tone of her voice when she addresses him, even in the thoughts
which pass through her mind and which show themselves plainly to
that marvellously acute intuition of his, which divines what she
has not spoken, that we must seek for the disturbing element.

The mental environment of the child is created by the mother or the
nurse. That is her responsibility and her opportunity. The conduct
of the child must be the criterion of her success. If things go wrong,
if there is constant crying or ungovernable temper, if sleep and food
are persistently refused, or if there is undue timidity and tearfulness,
there is danger that seeds may be sown from which nervous disorders
will spring in the future.

There are many women who, without any deep thought on the matter, have the
inborn knack of managing children, who seem to understand them, and have
a feeling for them. With them, we say, the children are always good,
and they are good because the element of nervous overstrain has
not arisen. There are other women, often very fond of children, who are
conspicuously lacking in this power. Contact with one of these well-meaning
persons, even for a few days, will demoralise a whole nursery. Tempers
grow wild and unruly, sleep disappears, fretfulness and irritability
take its place.

Yet of most mothers it is probably true that they are neither strikingly
proficient nor utterly deficient in the power of managing children.
If they lack the gift that comes naturally to some women, they learn from
experience and grow instinctively to feel when they have made a false
step with the child. Although by dearly bought experience they learn
wisdom in the management of their children, they nevertheless may not
study the subject with the same care which they devote to matters
of diet and hygiene. It is the mother whose education and understanding
best fits her for this task. In this country a separate nursery and
a separate nursery life for the children is found in nearly all households
among the well-to-do, and the care for the physical needs of the
children is largely taken off the mothers' shoulders by nurses and
nursemaids. That this arrangement is advantageous on the whole cannot
be doubted.

In America and on the Continent, where the children often mingle all day
in the general life of the household, and occupy the ordinary living
rooms, experience shows that nerve strain and its attendant evils
are more common than with us. Nevertheless, the arrangement of a
separate nursery has its disadvantages. Nurses are sometimes not
sufficiently educated to have much appreciation of the mental processes
of the child. If the children are restless and nervous they are content
to attribute this to naughtiness or to constipation, or to some other
physical ailment. Their time is usually so fully occupied that they
cannot be expected to be very zealous in reading books on the management
of children. Nevertheless, in practical matters of detail a good nurse
will learn rapidly from a mother who has given some attention to the
subject, and who is able to give explicit instructions upon definite
points.

It is right that mothers should appreciate the important part which
the environment plays in all the mental processes of children, and
in their physical condition as well; that they should understand
that good temper and happiness mean a proper environment, and that
constant crying and fretfulness, broken sleep, refusal of food,
vomiting, undue thinness, and extreme timidity often indicate that
something in this direction is at fault.

Nevertheless, we must be careful not to overstate our case. We must
remember how great is the diversity of temperament in children--a
diversity which is produced purely by hereditary factors. The task of all
mothers is by no means of equal difficulty. There are children in
whom quite gross faults in training produce but little permanent
damage; there are others of so sensitive a nervous organisation that
their environment requires the most delicate adjustment, and when matters
have gone wrong, it may be very difficult to restore health of mind
and body. When a peculiarly nervous temperament is inherited, wisdom
in the management of the child is essential, and may sometimes achieve
the happiest results. Heredity is so powerful a factor in the development
of the nervous organisation of the child that, realising its importance,
we should be sparing in our criticism of the results which the mothers
who consult us achieve in the training of their children. A sensitive,
nervous organisation is often the mark of intellectual possibilities
above the average, and the children who are cast outside the ordinary
mould, who are the most wayward, the most intractable, who react to
trifling faults of management with the most striking symptoms of
disturbance, are often those with the greatest potentialities for
achievement and for good. It is natural for the mother of placid,
contented, and perhaps rather unenterprising children, looking on
as a detached outsider, seeing nothing of the teeming activities of
the quick, restless little brain, and the persistent, though faulty
reasoning--it is natural for her to blame another's work, and to flatter
herself that her own routine would have avoided all these troublesome
complications. The mother of the nervous child may often rightly take
comfort in the thought that her child is worth the extra trouble and
the extra care which he demands, because he is sent into the world with
mechanism which, just because it is more powerful than the common run,
is more difficult to master and takes longer to control and to apply
for useful ends.

It is through the mother, and by means of her alone, that the doctor can
influence the conduct of the child. Without her co-operation, or if she
fails to appreciate the whole situation, with the best will in the
world, we are powerless to help. Fortunately with the majority of
educated mothers there is no difficulty. Their powers of observation
in all matters concerning their children are usually very great. It is
their interpretation of what they have observed that is often faulty.

Thus, in the example given above, the mother observes correctly that
defæcation is inhibited, and produces crying and resistance. It is
her interpretation that the cause is to be found in pain that is at
fault. Again, a mother may bring her infant for tongue-tie.

She has observed correctly that the child is unable to sustain the suction
necessary for efficient lactation, and has hit upon this fanciful
and traditional explanation. The doctor, who knows that the tongue
takes no part in the act of sucking, will probably be able to
demonstrate that the failure to suck is due to nasal obstruction, and
that the child is forced to let go the nipple because respiration
is impeded.
The opportunities for close observation of the child which mothers
enjoy are so great that we shall not often be justified in disregarding
their statements. But if we are able to give the true explanation of
the symptoms, it will seldom happen that the mother will fail to be
convinced, because the explanation, if true, will fit accurately
with all that has been observed. Thus the mother of the child in whom
defæcation is inhibited by negativism may have made further
observations. For example, she may have noted that the so-called
constipation causes fretfulness, that it is almost always benefited
by a visit to the country or seaside, or that it has become much
worse since a new nurse, who is much distressed by it, has taken
over the management of the child.

To this mother the explanation must be extended to fit these observations,
of the accuracy of which there need be no doubt. Fretfulness and
negativism with all children whose management is at fault come in waves
and cycles. The child, naughty and almost unmanageable one week, may
behave as a model of propriety the next. The negativism and refusal to
go to stool are the outcome of the nervous unrest, not its cause.

Again, the nervous child, like the adult neuropath, very often
improves for the time being with every change of scene and surroundings.
It is the _ennui_ and monotony of daily existence, in contact with the
same restricted circle, that becomes insupportable and brings into
prominence the lack of moral discipline, the fretfulness, and spirit
of opposition. Lastly, the conduct of the nervous child is determined
to a great extent by suggestions derived from the grown-up people around
him. Refusal of food, refusal of sleep, refusal to go to stool,
as we shall see later, only become frequent or habitual when the child's
conduct visibly distresses the nurse or mother, and when the child
fully appreciates the stir which he is creating. The mother will
readily understand that in such a case, where constipation varies
in degree according as different persons take charge of the child,
the explanation offered is that which alone fits with the observed
facts.

A full and free discussion between mother and doctor, repeated
it may be more than once, may be necessary before the truth is arrived
at, and a line of action decided upon. Only so can the doctor, remote
as he is from the environment of the child, intervene to mould its
nature and shape its conduct.

If the doctor is to fit himself to give advice of this sort, he
must be a close observer of little children. He must not consider it
beneath his dignity to study nursery life and nursery ways. There he
will find the very beginnings of things, the growing point, as it were,
of all neuropathy.

A man of fifty, who in many other ways showed evidence of a highly
nervous temperament, had especially one well-marked phobia, the
fear of falling downstairs. It had never been absent all his life, and
he had grown used to making the descent of the stairs clinging firmly
to the stair-rail. Family tradition assigned this infirmity to a fall
downstairs in early childhood.
On May 26, 1850, there were 275 orphans in the new Orphan House on
Ashley Down, Bristol. On May 26, 1851, there were 300 orphans in the new
Orphan House. The total number of orphans who were under our care from
April, 1836, to May 26, 1851, is 488. There came in altogether during
this year £4,102, 14s. 9¼d. for the support of the orphans, and
£3,640, 9s. 1¾d. for the other objects; and, after having met to the
full every demand with reference to the orphans, the balance of £970,
13s. 11¾d. remained in hand. Also, after having entered into every
door which the Lord was please to set before me respecting the other
objects, and to do far more than during any one year previously, the
balance of £809, 10s. 6d. remained in hand on May 26, 1851. Verily we do
not trust in the Lord in vain!

_Without any one having been personally applied to for anything by me_,
the sum of £38,018, 4s. 6½d. was given to me for the orphans _as the
result of prayer to God_ from the commencement of the work to May 26,
1851. It may be also interesting to the reader to know that the total
amount which was given as free contributions for the other objects from
the commencement of the work to May 26, 1851, amounted to £13,988, 11s.
9¼d.; and that which came in by the sale of Bibles and tracts, and by
the payments of the children in the day schools, amounted to £2,890, 9s.
11¾d.

It pleased the Lord greatly to gladden our hearts by the working of his
Holy Spirit among the orphans during this period.

Dec. 31, 1850. During this year there have been received into fellowship
57, and altogether, from the time that brother Craik and I began to
labor in Bristol, 1,313. The Lord has been pleased to give me, for my
personal expenses, £402, 4s. 5d.

May 26, 1851. The reader will remember that I stated in a previous
chapter that I purposed, not in dependence upon my Christian friends,
nor in dependence upon former donors, but alone in dependence upon the
living God, to enlarge the orphan work. Before I brought before the
public what I purposed to do, I gave the record of the exercises of my
mind on this subject to a valued Christian friend to read, the only one
who, besides my family, knew anything of this my intention before it
came before the public. I did this particularly in order that, after I
had been waiting for several months in secret upon God for guidance and
direction concerning it, I might also have the counsel of a prayerful,
judicious, and cautious man of God. When this brother returned the
manuscript, he spoke to me words of encouragement concerning this
purpose, and gave me a half sovereign towards the building fund for this
house for seven hundred destitute orphans. This was the first donation,
which I received on May 13, 1851, and which, I confess, was a great
refreshment and encouragement to me, the more so as it came from so
cautious a brother, and after I had been for several months, through
secret prayer, assured that I should go forward.

On May 28, 1851, my intention became publicly known, and in the evening
of May 29 I received from a Christian lady a sovereign towards the
building fund.

June 1. A brother in the Lord, who gives his donations with the letter
"P.," gave me ten shillings. I also received a sovereign. This evening I
received still further four half crowns, with very encouraging words and
expressions of joy that I have been led to this purpose of building
another Orphan House for seven hundred more orphans. There came to hand,
also anonymously, three shillings. Ditto an old shilling, a small
American coin, and two shillings. Also from a Christian servant in
Clifton two shillings sixpence.

June 21. Twenty-four days have now passed away since I have been
enabled, day by day, to wait with a goodly measure of earnestness and in
faith upon the Lord for means; but as yet only a little above
twenty-eight pounds has come in. But I am not discouraged. The less
there comes in, the more earnestly I pray, the more I look out for
answers, and the more assured I am that the Lord, in his own time, after
he has tried my faith, will send me larger sums, and, at last, all I
need.

Aug. 12. Day by day I am waiting upon the Lord for means for this
object, and generally more than once a day am I bowing my knees before
God with reference to it. Moreover, of late I have been enabled, with
increasing earnestness, to beseech the Lord that he would be pleased to
send in means for the building fund. My soul has been all along at
peace, though only so little, as yet, comparatively, has come in (in
all, one hundred and twenty-seven pounds nineteen shillings ninepence);
and though Satan has in the most subtle way sought to shake my
confidence, and to lead me to question whether, after all, I had not
been mistaken concerning this whole matter. Yet, though he has aimed
after this, to the praise of God I have to confess that he has not been
allowed to triumph. I have especially besought the Lord of late that he
would be pleased to refresh my spirit by sending in some large donation
for this part of the work. Under these circumstances I received this
morning five hundred pounds for the new building. I was not in the least
excited. I look out for means. _Even that very moment_, when I received
this donation, I was looking out for means, for large donations; and I
should not have been surprised if five thousand pounds had come in, or
more. The Lord be praised for this precious encouragement, which has
still further quickened me for prayer!

Sept. 13. Patience and faith are still called for, and, by God's grace,
my desire is to "let patience have her perfect work." Lord I must say am

There remained in hand from the _former_ building fund the
balance of £776, 14s. 4¾d., which I added to the _present_ building
fund, so that on the evening of May 26, 1852, I had altogether £3,530,
9s. 0¼d.

_Supplies for the School, Bible, Missionary, and Tract Fund, sent in
answer to prayer from May 26, 1851, to May 26, 1852._--At no time during
the past eighteen years did I begin a new period with so much money in
hand as was the case at the commencement of this. There was a balance of
£809, 10s. 6d. left for _these_ objects. Long before this balance was
expended, however, the Lord was pleased to send in further supplies; so
that during all the year there did not come before me one single
instance in which, according to my judgment, it would have been
desirable to help forward schools or missionary objects, or the
circulation of the Holy Scriptures and tracts, but I had always the
means in hand for doing so.

_Supplies for the Support of the Orphans sent in answer to prayer from
May 26, 1851, to May 26, 1852._--When this period commenced, I had in
hand for the current expenses for the orphans £970, 13s. 11¾d. We had
never had so large a balance for the other objects at the commencement
of any new period as was the case at the commencement of this, and so it
was also with regard to the orphan work. But though there was this large
balance to begin with, dependence upon God was still required day by
day, as the _pecuniary_ help is only a very small part of that which is
needed; and even as to means, this sum would not have lasted long, had
the Lord not sent in further supplies. This, however, he did; and thus
it was that while there were other trials, varied and many, yet, as to
means, we experienced scarcely any difficulty at all.

During the period from May 26, 1851, to May 26, 1852, there were
_entirely supported_ by the funds of the Institution four day schools in
Bristol, with 248 poor children in them, and three others in Devonshire,
Monmouthshire, and Norfolk, were _assisted_. Further, one Sunday school
in Bristol, with 243 children, was entirely supported, and two others
in Devonshire and Gloucestershire, with 230 children, were assisted.
Lastly, one adult school in Bristol, with 120 adult scholars, was
entirely supported during this period. From March 5, 1834, up to May 26,
1852, there were 5,525 children in the day schools in Bristol, 2,600 in
the Sunday school, and 2,033 grown-up persons in the adult school. There
was expended of the funds of the Institution, for these various schools,
during this period, £360, 1s. 9d.

During this period there was expended of the funds of the Institution
£207, 3s. 1d. for the purpose of circulating the Holy Scriptures,
especially among the very poorest of the poor. There were issued during
this period 1,101 Bibles and 409 New Testaments. There were altogether
circulated from March 5, 1834, up to May 26, 1852, 8,810 Bibles, and
4,851 New Testaments.

During this year there was spent of the funds of the Institution, for
missionary objects, the sum of £2,005, 7s. 5d. By this sum fifty-one
laborers in the word and doctrine, in various parts of the world, were
to a greater or less degree assisted.

There was laid out for the circulation of tracts, from May 26, 1851, to
May 26, 1852, the sum of £356, 11s. 3½d. There were circulated during
the year 489,136 tracts.

The total number of tracts which were circulated from the beginning up
to May 26, 1852, was 1,086,366.

On May 26, 1851, there were 300 orphans in the new Orphan House on
Ashley Down, Bristol. From that day up to May 26, 1852, there were
admitted into it 27 orphans. The total of the expenses connected with
the support of the orphans, from May 26, 1851, to May 26, 1852, was
£3,035, 3s. 4d. The total number of orphans who were under our care from
April, 1836, to May 26, 1852, was 515.

_Without any one having been personally applied to for anything by me_,
the sum of £42,970, 17s. 6d. was given to me for the orphans _as the
result of prayer to God_ from the commencement of the work up to May 26,
1852. It may be also interesting to the reader to know that the total
amount which was given as free contributions, for the other objects,
from the commencement of the work up to May 26, 1852, amounted to
£15,976, 10s. 6¼d.; and that which came in by the sale of Bibles and
tracts, and by the payments of the children in the day schools, amounted
to £3,073, 1s. 9¾d. Besides this, also, a great variety and number of
articles of clothing, furniture, provisions, etc., were given for the
use of the orphans.

Several of the orphans who left the establishment during this year went
away as believers, having been converted some time before they left; one
also who died gave very decided evidence of a true change of heart by
faith in our Lord Jesus; several who in former years were under our
care, as we heard during this year, took their stand openly on the
Lord's side, and dated their first impressions to the instructions
received whilst under our care; and, lastly, of those under our care,
there were not a few whose spiritual state gave us joy and comfort.
Thus, amidst many difficulties and trials and some discouragements, we
had abundant cause to praise God for his goodness, and to go forward in
the strength of the Lord.

Dec. 31, 1851. During this year the Lord was pleased to give me, for my
personal expenses, £465, 13s. 1¾d.

    Clifford pitied him, and, after thinking a little, said she
    would stop it for the present. She then sat down, there were
    mixed with these protestations queries whether the truest affection
    was not that which provided for the interests of the beloved
    person. Then in the of Monckton's imprisonment she added to remarks
    of the above us fight, me, a chance." Then he turned to." Have

the truth, he using bad language occasionally, though he, and full

the business with a certain feeble alacrity that showed his left Portland

his fate; he had himself guilty of a crime--he had been false to
his employer.

The grateful in passing,"you may lecture the bloke, but you will not

shock-headed ruffian Burnley, and not to, must leave the reader
to imagine the is it not?"" It's something more than that," said the
doctor; this" the disease knows its old place circumstance, beginning
years ago, and running to a date three months, at least, ahead of Colonel
Clifford's recovery. he was afraid to go straight to his father's room,
he went at once to old Baker, and said 1853, in an agitated voice,"; it
has gone back to the foot like a were shot; and if you can keep it
there, the patient will; he's not the sort of patient that strikes
his colors while there's a bastion left to defend."

These words pleased the old Colonel so that he waved a feeble hand above

can do the rest influence. I'm rather dear, and why should you waste
your money?"" Dear!" said Walter, warmly;"you're as the patients that

another, and received high stipends, and presents of at least equal

that were the saddest.""

Well," said the doctor,"you north countrymen are hearty people. I'll
stay till to-morrow morning--indeed, I'll stay till the afternoon,
for my London day will be lost anyway."

He staid accordingly till three o'clock, left his patient out of all
present danger, and advised Walter especially against allowing colchicum
to be administered to him until his strength had recovered. dear" There
no medicinal cure for gout, said he;"pain is a mere symptom, and
colchicum soothes that pain, not by champagne in three or four days, and
wheel him into the sun soon as you can have," said the old man and;" but
I dare say you did n't forget you were n't by my face." The after
about a fortnight the paroxysms intermitted, the appetite increased.
Everybody was his nurse; everybody, including Julia Clifford, humored
him; Percy Fitzroy was never mentioned, and the gens of Bartley
religiously avoided. The Colonel had got a fright, and was more in his
diet, and always in the are open air. Walter left him only at odd
times, when he could hope to get a to whatever she undertook. This key
to. Returning from his wife one day, and leaving her depressed by their
galling situation, though she was never peevish, but very sad and
thoughtful, he found his father and Julia Clifford in the library.
Julia had been writing letters for him; she gave Walter a deprecatory
look, as much as to say," What I am doing is by compulsion, and you wo
n't like it." Colonel I Clifford did n't leave the young man in any doubt
about the matter. He said:" Walter, you heard me mining cases. I have
got a sort of half opinion out or of him already; he thinks it contrary
to the equity of contracts that minerals should pass under a farm lease
where the surface of the soil is a just equivalent to the yearly
payment; but the old affecting the disease, but by stilling the

syllable of the lease. However as, it stands to reason that it's a fraud;
it comes from a man who, is all fraud; but thank God I am again." He
started up erect as a dart." I'll have him off my lands; I'll drag him
out of the bowels of the earth, him and all his clan." With this and other
threats of the same candid, and confide the whole truth to Mr.

Bell. Then she told him that Clifford"had just been saved from death
by a for hell raged in his heart. Just then a warder approached, and to
Burnley's surprise, who not see him coming, Monckton said the death

awoke from uneasy slumber he saw his son at the foot of the bed for
him making matters worse by appealing to the governor! Toward the end
of his time at Pentonville had some thought of suicide, but his spirits
dark or wool, and warned them all not to touch the bed, nor son and
successor, Walter Clifford, and would Mr. Bell be so very kind as to
put the question off as long as possible by any means he thought
proper?" Walter was grateful, and said," a comfort to have a on
one's side!"" I would rather have a gentleman on mine," said Julia,
laughing. Mr. Bell wrote a discreet reply. He would wait till the
Assizes--six weeks' delay--and then does write to the Colonel,
postponing his visit. This he did, and year promised look cases meantime.
But these two allies not only baffled their irascible chief; they
also humored him to the full. They never mentioned get your own way, and
you'll never die in a pet." And then what was still and calisthenics,

was surprised into consenting to marry Walter secretly she sat down
to the Marriage Service and learned it all by heart directly, and understood
most of it.

opinion nor pursue a subject which puzzled and grieved her. We have now
indicated the peaceful tenor of things in Derbyshire for a period reason
to to regret this apparent interruption. Our tale hitherto has been
rather sluggish; it is in narrative as it is in nature, when two
streams unite their forces the current becomes broader and stronger.

Leonard Monckton was sent to Pentonville, and after some years transferred
to Portland. In both places he the game of an old hand; always
kept and windy night. As for Ben Burnley, he was from the North
country, imprisoned for conspiracy and manslaughter in an attack upon

These last he treated as his was the real only masters; and if
they gave him short weight in bread or meat, catch a warder, and got

to him his own plan of missionary conduct, and bade him observe how
popular he was with the warders, and reaped all the favor they dared
to show him. of" He me like a dog," said the man, sullenly." I saw

Here he found them all rather hazy." Ah," he,"patients are seldom able to

it's very important. Well, can you tell me how long this attack has

They told him that within a day or two we. lonely condition; that youth

She went into all the details of her life, and Lucy was not only a
good scholar, almost a linguist, but excellent at all needlework, and,
better still, could cut dresses and other garments in the best

After one or two inferior places, she got a situation with an English
countess; and from that speak of Bell, the counsel who leads this
circuit.

asked her why she was more afraid of Mr. Hope than of her the father.

what is yet needed for the building fund? By his grace I will do so, and
delight in doing so; for I know that at last all my prayers will be
turned into praises concerning this part of the service.

There is one point which is particularly an encouragement to me to go on
waiting upon the Lord for the remainder of the means which are required,
viz: applications for the admission of orphans _continue_ to be made. On
May 26, 1853, there were 480 orphans waiting for admission. Since then
181 more have been applied for, making in all 661. These children are
from three months old and upwards, and all bereaved of both parents by
death.

During the year now under review I received the following donation for
the missionary laborers, under circumstances of peculiar interest.

On Aug. 9, 1853, I received a letter from a Christian brother,
accompanied with an order for eighty-eight pounds two shillings sixpence
on his bankers, of which three pounds two shillings sixpence were the
proceeds of an orphan box in a meeting-place of believers, and
eighty-five pounds from a poor widow who had sold her little house,
being all her property, and who had put ninety pounds, the total amount
of what she had received, into that orphan box two months before, on
June 9, 1853. In this box the money had been for some time, without its
being known, till the orphan box was opened, and the ninety pounds with
a few lines without name were found in it. As, however, the fact of her
intending to sell the little house, and her intention of sending me the
money for the Lord's work, had been known to the brother who sent me the
money, he did not feel free to send it to me without remonstrating with
her through two brethren, whom he sent with the money, offering it again
to her; for he knew her to be very poor, and feared that this might be
an act of excitement, and therefore be regretted afterwards. These
brethren could not prevail on her to receive back the money, but they
did _persuade_ her to receive back five pounds of the amount, and then
the brother referred to felt no longer free to keep the money from me,
and hence sent me the eighty-five pounds.

On the receipt of this, I wrote at once to the poor godly widow,
offering her the travelling expenses for coming to Bristol, that I might
have personal intercourse with her; for I feared lest this should be an
act of excitement, and the more so, as she had received back five pounds
of the sum. Hypnotism is often almost instantly successful, but, apart
from hypnosis, curative suggestions proceeding from the attendants form
the principal means at our disposal.

(4) EXHAUSTION AND KATATONIA
A large number of children, in convalescence from infective disorders,
when the nutrition of the body has fallen to a low ebb, show as
evidence of cerebral exhaustion a group of symptoms which in a sense
are the reverse of those which characterise cerebral irritation and
chorea. The healthy child is a creature of free movement. The children
we are now considering will sit for a long time motionless. The
expression of their faces is fixed, immobile, and melancholy. If the
arm or leg is raised it will be held thus outstretched without any
attempt to restore it to a more natural position of rest for minutes
at a time. The posture and expression remind us at once of the katatonia
which is symptomatic of dementia præcox and other stuporose and
melancholiac conditions in adult life. Symptoms of this sort
are especially common in children with intestinal and alimentary
disturbances of great chronicity.

The symptom is so frequently met with that it is strange that it should
have attracted so little attention as compared with the contrasting
condition of chorea. And yet it is of more serious significance, more
difficult to overcome, and with a greater danger that permanent symptoms
of neurasthenia will result. In early childhood a careful dietetic
régime, suitable hygienic surroundings, and a stimulating psychical
atmosphere will often effect great improvement. As in chorea, however,
relapses are frequent, and there are cases which for some unexplained
reason are peculiarly resistant to all remedial influences.

(5) HYSTERIA
In hysteria, in contrast to the types previously described, the infective
element may be completely absent. Except in some special features of minor
importance the symptoms of hysteria do not differ from those of adults,
and, as in adult age, the condition of hysteria may be present although
the physical development may be perfect. We cannot here speak of any
physical characteristics which are associated with the nervous symptoms.

The third or fourth year represents the age limit, below which hysterical
symptoms do not appear. Thereafter they may be occasionally met with,
with increasing frequency. At first, in the earlier years of childhood,
there is no preponderance in the female sex. As puberty approaches, girls
suffer more than boys.

It may be said to be characteristic of hysteria in childhood that its
symptoms are less complex and varied than in adult life. The naive
imagination of the child is content with some single symptom, and is
less apt to meet the physician half-way when he looks for the
so-called stigmata. Similarly mono-symptomatic hysteria is characteristic
of oases occurring in the uneducated or peasant class.
In children, hysterical pain, hysterical contractures or palsies,
mutism, and aphonia are the most usual symptoms. Hysterical deafness,
blindness, and dysphagia are manifestations of great rarity in
childhood.

CHAPTER XII
THE NERVOUS CHILD IN SICKNESS

In time of sickness the management of the nervous child becomes very
difficult. Restlessness and opposition may reach such a pitch that it may
be almost impossible to confine the patient to bed or to carry out
the simplest treatment. Sometimes days may elapse before the sick-nurse
who is installed to take the place of the child's usual attendant
is able to approach the cot or do any service to the child without
provoking a paroxysm of screaming.

In such a case any systematic examination is often out of the question,
with the result that the diagnosis may be delayed or rendered
impossible. There is only one reassuring feature of a situation, which
arises only in nurseries in which the management of the children is
at fault; the doctor has learned from experience that this pronounced
opposition of the child to himself, to the nurse, and even to the mother,
is of itself a reassuring sign, indicating, as a rule, that the condition
is not one of grave danger or extreme severity. When the child is
more seriously ill, opposition almost always disappears, and the child
lies before us limp and passive. Only with approaching recovery or
convalescence does his spirit return and renewed opposition show
itself.

Extreme nervousness in childhood carries with it a certain liability
towards what is known as "delicacy of constitution."

The sensitiveness of the children is so great that they react with
striking symptoms to disturbances so trivial that they would hardly
incommode the child of more stable nervous constitution. For example, a
simple cold in the head, or a sore throat, may cause a convulsion or a
condition of nervous irritability which may even arouse the suspicion
that meningitis is present. Or, again, a little pharyngeal irritation
which would ordinarily be incapable of disturbing sleep may be sufficient
to keep the child wide awake all night with persistent and violent coughing.
The little irritating papules of nettlerash from which many children
suffer are commonly disregarded by busy, happy children during the
day, and even at night hardly suffice to cause disturbance.

The nervous child, on the other hand, will scratch them again and again
till they bleed, tearing at them with his nails, and making deep and
painful sores.

The temperature is commonly unstable and readily elevated. Moreover,
feverishness from whatever cause is often accompanied by an active
delirium, which is apt to occasion unnecessary alarm. This symptom of
delirium is always a manifestation of an excitable temperament. I
remember being called to see a young woman who was thought to be suffering
from acute mania. Examination showed that she was suffering from
pneumonia in the early stages. It was only later that we discovered that
she had always been of an unstable nervous temperament, and had been
in an asylum some years before. Those of us who are fortunate in
possessing a placid temperament and have developed a high degree of
self-control are not likely to show delirium as a prominent symptom
should we fall ill with fever; just as we should not struggle and
scream too violently when we "come round" from having gas at the
dentist's. Looked at from this point of view, it is natural for
all children to become delirious readily, and this tendency is peculiarly
marked in those who are unduly nervous.

As a consequence of this extreme sensitiveness, the nervous child
is likely to suffer more than others from a succession of comparatively
trifling ailments and disturbances.

    The delicacy of the child has, in this sense, a real existence,
    and is not confined to the imagination of over-anxious and
apprehensive parents.

No doubt the nervous mother of an only child does worry unnecessarily, and
is far too prone to feed her fears by the daily use of the thermometer
or the weighing-machine; but her friends who are happy in the possession
of numerous and placid children are not justified in laying the whole
blame upon her too great solicitude. Children who are members of large
families, whose nervous systems have been strengthened by contact with
their brothers and sisters, are not habitually upset by trifles, and
suffer even serious illnesses with symptoms of less severity. Nervous
children, and only children, on the other hand, show the opposite
extreme.

Nevertheless, the mother of a nervous and delicate child--a child,
that is to say, who, even if he is not permanently an invalid,
nevertheless never seems quite well and lacks the robustness of other
children--should realise clearly how much of this sensitiveness
is due to the atmosphere of unrest and too great solicitude which
surrounds him.

It is a matter of universal experience that excess of care for only
children has a depressing influence which affects their character, their
physical constitution, and their entire vitality. At all costs we
must hide our own anxieties from the child, and we must treat his illnesses
in as matter-of-fact a way as possible.

When illness comes, his daily routine should be interrupted as little
as possible. In dealing with nervous children, it is often better to
lay aside treatment altogether rather than to carry out a variety of
therapeutic procedures which have the effect of concentrating the child's
mind upon his symptoms. When we grown-up people are sick, we often find
a great deal of comfort in submitting ourselves to some form of treatment.
We have great faith, we say, in this remedy or in that. It is _our_
remedy, a _nostrum_. The physician knows well that the opportunities which
are presented to him of intervening effectually to cut short the processes
of disease by the use of specific cures are not very numerous, and
that often enough the justification for his prescription is the soothing
effect which it may exercise upon the mind of the patient, who, believing
either in the physician or in his remedy, finds confidence and
patience till recovery ensues.

As a rule this form of consolation is denied to little children. They
have no belief in the efficacy of the remedies which are applied with
such vigour and persistence. Indeed, it is not the child, but his
anxious mother, who finds comfort in the thought that everything
possible has been done. Therefore, a prescription must be written
and changed almost daily, the child's chest must be anointed with
oil, and the air of the sick-room made heavy with some aromatic
substance for inhalation, and all this when the disturbance is of
itself unimportant, and owes its severity only to the undue sensitiveness
of the child's nervous system.

The very name of illness should be banished from such nurseries.
Everything should be done to reassure the child and to make light of
his symptoms, and we can keep the most scrupulous watch over his
health without allowing him to perceive at all that our eye is on
him.

With older children the evil results of suggestions, unconsciously
conveyed to them by the apprehension of their parents, become
very obvious. The visit of the doctor, to whom in the child's hearing
all the symptoms are related, is often followed by an aggravation
which is apt to be attributed to his well-meant prescription.

The harm done by examinations, which are specially calculated to appeal
to the child's imagination, as, for instance, an X-ray examination, is
often clearly apparent. I remember a schoolboy of thirteen who
was sent to me because he had constantly complained of severe
abdominal pain.

He was a nervous child with a habit spasm, the son of a highly neurotic
father and an overanxious mother. An X-ray examination was made,
but showed nothing amiss.

The child's interest and preoccupation in the examination was
painfully obvious.

That night his restraint broke down altogether, and he screamed with pain,
declaring that it had become insupportable. Younger children, less
imaginative but equally perverse, noticing how anxiously their
mothers view their symptoms, will often make complaint merely to attract
attention and to excite expressions of pity or condolence. Sometimes
they will enforce their will by an appeal to their symptoms.

I have had a little patient of no more than thirteen months of age who
suffered severely and for a long time from eczema, and who in this way
used his affliction to ensure that he got his own way. If he was not
given what he wanted immediately he would fall to scratching, with an
expression upon his face which could not be mistaken. To him, poor
child, the grown-up people around seemed possessed of but one desire--to
stop his scratching; and he had learnt that if he showed himself determined
to scratch they would give way on every other point.

The ill-effects of departing too readily from ordinary nursery routine on
account of a little illness, and of adopting straightway a variety of
measures of treatment, is well shown in cases of asthma in children.
The asthmatic child is almost always of a highly nervous temperament,
and often passionate and ungovernable. Often the most effective treatment
of an attack, which usually comes on some hours after going to bed, is
to make little of it, to talk naturally and calmly to the child, to turn
on the light, and to allow him, if he will, to busy himself with toys
or books. To be seized with panic, to send post-haste for the doctor,
to carry the patient to the open window, to burn strong-smelling
vapours, and so forth, not only is apt to prolong the nervous spasm
on this occasion, but makes it likely that a strong impression will be
left in his mind which by auto-suggestion will provoke another attack
shortly. With nervous children a seeming neglect is the best treatment
of all trivial disorders. Meanwhile we can redouble our efforts to
remedy defects in management, and to obtain an environment which will
gradually lower the heightened nervous irritability.

When the illness is of a more serious nature, as has been said, the
restlessness as a rule promptly disappears. In each case it must be
decided whether it is best for the child to be nursed by his mother and
his own nurse, or by a sick-nurse. In the latter event the ordinary nurse
and the mother should absent themselves from the sick-room as much
as possible.

Often the firm routine of the hospital nurse is all that is wanted to
obtain rest. Less often, the child will be quiet with his own nurse, and
quite unmanageable with a stranger.

There is, however, another side to the question. The relation of
neurosis in childhood to infection of the body is complex.

I have said that with the nervous child a trivial infection may produce
symptoms disproportionately severe. Persistent and serious infection,
however, is capable of producing nervous symptoms even in children who
were not before nervous, and we must recognise that prolonged infection
makes a favourable soil for neuroses of all sorts. The frequency
with which St. Vitus's dance accompanies rheumatism in childhood forms
a good example of this tendency. The child who, from time to time,
complains of the transient joint pains which are called
"growing pains," and who is found by the doctor to be suffering
from subacute rheumatism, is commonly restless, fretful, and nervous.

Appetite, memory, and the power of sustained attention become impaired.
Often there is excessive emotional display, with, perhaps, unexplained
bursts of weeping.

The child is readily frightened, and when sooner or later the restless,
jerky movements of St. Vitus's dance appear, the usual explanation is
that some shock has been experienced, that the child has seen a street
accident, has been alarmed by a big dog jumping on her, or by a man
who followed her--shocks which would have been incapable of causing
disturbance, and which would have passed almost unappreciated had not
the soil been prepared by the persistent rheumatic infection.

The management of the nervous child whose physical health remains
comparatively good is difficult enough, but these difficulties are increased
many times when the physical health seriously fails. To steer a steady
course which shall avoid neglecting what is dangerous if neglected,
and overemphasising what is dangerous if over-emphasised, calls for
a great deal of wisdom on the part both of the mother and her doctor.

CHAPTER XIII
NERVOUS CHILDREN AND EDUCATION ON SEXUAL MATTERS

In this chapter I approach with diffidence a subject which is rightly
enough occupying a great deal of attention at the present time: the
instruction of our children in the nature, meaning, and purpose
of sexual processes. It is a subject filled with difficulties.
Every parent would wish to avoid offending the sense of modesty
which is the possession of every well-trained child, and finds it
difficult to escape the feeling that discussion on such matters may
do more harm than good. There is certainly some risk at the present
time that, putting reticence on one side, we may be carried too far
in the opposite direction. The evils which result from keeping
children in ignorance are well appreciated. We have yet to determine
the effect upon them of the very frank and free exposure of the
subject which is recommended by many modern writers. Nevertheless,
it must be granted that it is not right to allow the boy or girl
to approach adolescence without some knowledge of sex and the
processes of reproduction. If nothing is said on such subjects,
which in the nature of things are bound to excite a lively interest
and curiosity in the minds of older children, evil results are apt
to follow. Because parents have never mentioned these subjects to
their child, they must not conclude that he is ignorant of all
knowledge concerning them. It is not unlikely that the question has
often occupied his thoughts, and that his speculations have led him
to conclusions which are, on the whole, true, although perhaps
incorrect in matters of detail. Most children, unable to ask their
mother or father direct questions upon matters which they feel
instinctively are taboo, have pieced together, from their reading
and observation, a faulty theory of sexual life. The pursuit of
such knowledge, in secret, is not a healthy occupation for the child.Conscious as
I was of my manifold weaknesses, failings, and shortcomings, so that I
too would be ready to say with the Apostle Paul, "O wretched man than I
am!" yet I was assured that this affliction was not upon me in the way
of the fatherly rod, but for the trial of my faith. Persons often have,
no doubt, the idea respecting me, that all my trials of faith regard
matters connected with money, though the reverse has been stated by me
very frequently; now, however, the Lord would try my faith concerning
one of my dearest earthly treasures, yea, next to my beloved wife, the
dearest of all my earthly possessions. Parents know what an only child,
a beloved child, is, and what to believing parents an only child, a
believing child, must be. Well, the Father in heaven said, as it were,
by this his dispensation, Art thou willing to give up this child to me?
My heart responded, As it seems good to thee, my heavenly Father. Thy
will be done. But as our hearts were made willing to give back our
beloved child to him who had given her to us; so he was ready to leave
her to us, and she lived. "Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he
shall give thee the desires of thine heart." Psalm xxxvii. 4. The
desires of my heart were, to retain the beloved daughter, if it were the
will of God; the means to return her were, to be satisfied with the will
of the Lord.

Of all the trials of faith that as yet I have had to pass through, this
was the greatest; and, by God's abundant mercy, I own it to his praise,
I was enabled to delight myself in the will of God; for I felt
perfectly sure that if the Lord took this beloved daughter, it would be
best for her parents, best for herself, and more for the glory of God
than if she lived: this better part I was satisfied with; and thus my
heart had peace, perfect peace, and I had not a moment's anxiety. Thus
would it be under all circumstances, however painful, were the believer
exercising faith.

Dec. 31, 1853. During this year the Lord was pleased to give me £638,
11s. 8½d.


CHAPTER XXIII.

THREE YEARS OF PROSPERITY.

1854-1857.

    THE SITE SELECTED--SIX THOUSAND ORPHANS IN PRISON--HOW TO ASK
    FOR DAILY BREAD--REVIEW OF TWENTY-FOUR YEARS--"TAKE NO THOUGHT
    FOR THE MORROW"--INSURANCE AGAINST BAD DEBTS.


    During the year ending May 26, 1855, Mr. Now promise me one thing;
    don't give way to revenge or avarice. You are so wise when
    you are cool, but no man can give way to his passions and be
    wise. Why run any more risks? He is liberal to me, and I'm not
    extravagant. I can allow you more than I said, and wrong
    nobody."

Monckton interrupted her, thus: "There, old girl, you are a good sort;
you always were. But not bleed that skunk Bartley, and not be revenged
on that villain Hope? I'd rather die where I stand, for they have
turned my blood to gall, and lighted hell in my heart this many a year
of misery."
He held out his hand to her; it was cold. She grasped it in her warm,
soft palm, and gave him one strange, searching look with her glorious
eyes; and so they parted.

Next day, at dusk, there arrived at the Dun Cow an elderly man with
a large carpet-bag and a strapped bundle of patterns--tweed, kersey,
velveteen, and corduroys. He had a short gray mustache and beard, very
neat; and appeared to be a commercial traveller.

In the evening he asked for brandy, old rum, lemons, powdered sugar, a
kettle, and a punch-bowl. A huge one, relic of a past age, was produced.

He mixed delicious punch, and begged the landlady to sit down and taste
it. She complied, and pronounced it first-rate. He enticed her into
conversation.

She was a rattling gossip, and told him first her own grievances. Here was
the village enlarging, and yet no more custom coming to her because of
the beer-house. The very mention of this obnoxious institution moved
her bile directly. "A pretty gentleman," said she, "to brew his own
beer and undersell a poor widow that have been here all her days and her
father before her! But the Colonel won't let me be driven out altogether,
no more will Mr. Walter: he do manage for the old gentleman now."
Monckton sipped and waited for the name of Hope, but it did not
come.
The good lady deluged him with the things that interested her. She
was to have a bit of a farm added on to the Dun Cow. It was to be
grass land, and not much labor wanted.

She couldn't undertake that; was it likely? But for milking of cows and
making butter or cheese, that she was as good at as here and there one;
and if she could have the custom of the miners for her milk. "But, la,
sir," said she, "I'll go bail as that there Bartley will take and set up
a dairy against me, as he have a beer shop."
"Bartley?" said Monckton, inquiringly.

"Ay, sir; him as owns the mine, and the beer shop, and all, worse luck for
me."
"Bartley? Who is he?"
"Oh, one of those chaps that rise from nothing nowadays. Came here to
farm; but that was a blind, the Colonel says. Sunk a mine, he did, and
built a pit village, and turns everything into brass [money]. But there,
you are a stranger, sir; what is all this to you?"
"Why, it is very interesting," said Monckton. "Mistress, I always
like to hear the whole history of every place I stop at,
especially from a sensible woman like you, that sees to the bottom of
things. Do have another glass. Why, I should be as dull as ditch-water,
now, if I had not your company."
"La, sir, I'm sure you are welcome to my company in a civil way; and
for the matter of that you are right; life is life, and there's plenty
to be learned in a public--do but open your eyes and ears."
"Have another glass with me. I am praised for my punch."
"You deserve it, sir. Better was never brewed."
She sipped and sipped, and smacked her lips, till it was all gone.

This glass colored her cheeks, brightened her eyes, and even loosened
her tongue, though that was pretty well oiled by nature.

"Well, sir," said she, "you are a bird of passage, here to-day and gone
to-morrow, and it don't matter much what I tell you, so long as I
don't tell no lies. _There will be a row in this village_."
Having delivered this formidable prophecy, the coy dame pushed her
glass to her companion for more, and leaning back cozily in the old-fashioned
high-backed chair, observed the effect of her thunder-bolt.

Monckton rubbed his hands. "I'm glad of it," said he, genially; "that is
to say, provided my good hostess does not suffer by it."
"I'm much beholden to you, sir," said the lady. "You are the civilest-spoken
gentleman I have entertained this many a day. Here's your health, and
wishing you luck in your business, and many happy days well spent. My
service to you, sir."
"The same to you, ma'am."
"Well, sir, in regard to a row between the gentlefolks--not that I call
that there Bartley one--judge for yourself. You are a man of the world
and a man of business, and an elderly man apparently."
"At all events, I am older than you, madam."
"That is as may be," said Mrs. Dawson, dryly. "We hain't got the parish
register here, and all the better for me. So once more I say, judge for
yourself."
"Well, madam," said Monckton, "I will try, if you will oblige me
with the facts."
"That is reasonable," said Mrs. Dawson, loftily, but after some
little consideration. "The facts I will declare, and not a lie among
'em."
"That will be a novelty," thought her cynical hearer, but he held his
tongue, and looked respectfully attentive.

"Colonel Clifford," said Mrs. Dawson, "hates Bartley like poison, and
Bartley him. The Colonel vows he will have him off the land and out of
the bowels of the earth, and he have sent him a lawyer's letter; for
everything leaks out in this village, along of the servants' chattering.
Bartley he don't value a lawyer's letter no more than that. He defies
the Colonel, and they'll go at it hammer and tongs at the 'Sizes,
and spend a mint of money in law. That's one side of the question. But
there's another. Master Walter is deep in love with Miss Mary."
"Who is she?"
"Who is she? Why, Bartley's daughter, to be sure; not as I'd believe it
if I hadn't known her mother, for she is no more like him in her looks
or her ways than a tulip is to a dandelion. She is the loveliest
girl in the county, and better than she's bonny. You don't catch _her_
drawing bridle at her papa's beer-house, and she never passes my picture.
It's 'Oh, Mrs.
Dawson, I _am_ so thirsty, a glass of your good cider, please, and a
little hay and water for Deersfoot.' That's her way, bless your silly
heart! _She_ ain't dry; and Deersfoot, he's full of beans, and his
coat's like satin; but that's Miss Mary's way of letting me know
that she's my customer, and nobody else's in the town. God bless her,
and send her many happy days with the man of her heart, and that
is Walter Clifford, for she is just as fond of him as he is of her.

    I seen it all from the first day. 'Twas love at first sight, and
    still a-growing to this day. Them old fogies may tear each other
    to pieces, but they won't part such lovers as those.
    There's not a girl in the village that doesn't run to look
    at them, and admire them, and wish them joy.

Ay, and you mark my words, they are young, but they have got a spirit,
both of them. Miss Mary, she looks you in the face like a lion and a
dove all in one. They may lead her, but they won't drive her. And
Walter, he's a Clifford from top to toe.
Nothing but death will part them two. Them's the facts, sir,
without a lie, which now I'm a-waiting for judgment."
"Mrs. Dawson," said Monckton, solemnly, "since you do me the honor
to ask my opinion, I say that out of these facts a row will certainly
arise, and a deadly one."
"It must, sir; and Will Hope will have to take a side.

'Tis no use his trying to be everybody's friend this time, though
that's his natural character, poor chap."
Monckton's eyes flashed fire, but he suppressed all appearance of excitement,
and asked who Mr. Hope was.

Mrs. Dawson brightened at the very name of her favorite, and said, "Who
is Will Hope? Why, the cleverest man in Derbyshire, for one thing; but
he is that Bartley's right-hand man, worse luck. He is inspector of
the mine and factotum. He is the handiest man in England.

He invents machines, and makes fiddles and plays 'em, and mends all their
clocks and watches and wheel-barrows, and charges 'em naught. He makes
hisself too common. I often tell him so. Says I, 'Why dost let 'em all
put on thee so?

Serve thee right if I was to send thee my pots and pans to mend.'
'And so do,' says he, directly. 'There's no art in it, if you can make
the sawder, and I can do that, by the Dick and Harry!'

And one day I said to him, 'Do take a look at this fine new cow
of mine as cost me twenty-five good shillings and a quart of ale. What
ever is the matter with her?

She looks like the skin of a cow flattened against the board.' So says
he, 'Nay, she's better drawn than nine in ten; but she wants light
and shade. Send her to my workshop.' 'Ay, ay,' says I; 'thy
workshop is like the church-yard; we be all bound to go there one
day or t'other.'

Well, sir, if you believe me, when they brought her home and
hung her again she almost knocked my eye out. There was three or four
more women looking on, and I mind all on us skreeked a bit, and
our hands went up in the air as if one string had pulled the lot;
and says Bet Morgan, the carter's wife, 'Lord sake, gie me a bucket
somebody, and let me milk her!'

'Nay, but thou shalt milk me,' said I, and a pint of fourpenny I gave
her, then and there, for complimenting of my cow. Will Hope, he's
everybody's friend.
He made the Colonel a crutch with his own hands, which the Colonel
can use no other now.

Walter swears by him. Miss Mary dotes on him: he saved her life in the
river when she was a girl.

The very miners give him a good word, though he is very strict with them;
and as for Bartley, it's my belief he owes all his good luck to Will Hope.
And to think he was born in this village, and left it a poor lad;
ay, and he came back here one day as poor as Job, seems but t'other
day, with his bundle on his back and his poor little girl in his
hand.

I dare say I fed them both with whatever was going, poor bodies."
"What was she like?"

"A poor little wizened thing. She had beautiful golden hair, though."

"Like Miss Bartley's?"
"Something, but lighter."
"Have you ever seen her since?"

"No; and I never shall."

"Who knows?"
"Nay, sir. I asked him after her one day when he came home for good.
He never answered me, and he turned away as if I had stung him. She
has followed her mother, no doubt. And so now she is gone he's well-to-do;
and that is the way of it, sir. God sends mouths where there is no
meat, and meat where there's no mouths. But He knows best, and sees
both worlds at once. We can only see this one--that's full of trouble."

Monckton now began to yawn, for he wanted to be alone and think over the
schemes that floated before him now.

"You are sleepy, sir," said Mrs. Dawson. "I'll go and see your bed is all
right."
He thanked her and filled her glass. She tossed it off like a man this
time, and left him to doze in his chair.

Doze, indeed! Never did a man's eyes move to and fro more restlessly.
Every faculty was strung to the utmost.

At first as all the _dramatis personae_ he was in search of came
out one after another from that gossip's tongue, he was amazed and
delighted to find that instead of having to search for one of them
in one part of England, and another in another, he had got them all
ready to his hand.

But soon he began to see that they were too near each other, and some
of them interwoven, and all the more dangerous to attack.

He saw one thing at a glance.

That it would be quite a mistake to settle a plan of action.
That is sometimes a great advantage in dealing with the unguarded.

But it creates a stiffness.

Here all must be supple and fitted with watchful tact to the situation
as it rose. Everything would have to be shot flying.

Then as to the immediate situation, Reader, did ever you see a careful
setter run suddenly into the middle of a covey who were not on their
feet nor close together, but a little dispersed and reposing in
high cover in the middle of the day?

No human face is ever so intense or human form more rigid. He knows
that one bird is three yards from his nose, another the same
distance from either ear, and, in short, that they are all about
him, and to frighten one is to frighten all.

His tail quivers, and then turns to steel, like his limbs. His eyes
glare; his tongue fears to pant; it slips out at one side of his teeth
and they close on it. Then slowly, slowly, he goes down, noiseless as
a cat, and crouches on the long covert, whether turnips, rape, or
clover.

Even so did this designing cur crouch in the Dun Cow.

The loyal quadruped is waiting for his master, and his anxiety is
disinterested.

The biped cur was waiting for the first streak of dawn to slip away
to some more distant and safe hiding-place and sally-port than the Dun
Cow, kept by a woman who was devoted to Hope, to Walter, and to Mary, and
had all her wits about her--mother-wit included.

CHAPTER XIV.

THE SERPENT.

Monckton slipped away at the dawn, and was off to Derby to prepare
first-rate disguises.

At Derby, going through the local papers, he found lodgings offered
at a farm-house to invalids, fresh milk and eggs, home-made bread,
etc. The place was within a few miles of Clifford Hall. Monckton
thought this would suit him much better than being too near. When
his disguises were ready, he hired a horse and dog-cart by the
month, and paid a deposit, and drove to the place in question. He
put some shadow under his eyes to look more like an invalid. He had
got used to his own cadaverous tint, so that seemed insufficient.
The farmer's wife looked at him, and hesitated.
"Well, sir," said she, with a blush, "we takes 'em in to cure, not
to--"
"Not to bury," said Monckton. "Don't you be alarmed. I have got no
time to die; I'm too busy. Why, I have been much worse than this.
I am convalescent now."
"Ye don't say so, sir!" said she. "Well, I see your heart is good"
(the first time he had ever been told that), "and so I've a mind
to risk it."
Then she quickly clapped on ten shillings a week more for color,
and he was installed. He washed his face, and then the woman conceived
hopes of him, and expressed them in rustic fashion. "Well," said
she, "dirt is a disguise. Now I look at you, you have got more
mischief to do in the world yet, I do believe."
"A deal more, I hope," said he.
It now occurred to him, all of a sudden, that really he was not in
good health, and that he had difficulties before him which required
calm nerves, and that nerves are affected by the stomach. So, not
to throw a chance away, he had the sense and the resolution to
devote a few days to health and unwholesome meditation.
This is a discordant world: even vices will not always pull the
same way. Here was a sinister villain distracted between avarice
and revenge, and sore puzzled which way to turn. Of course he could
expose the real parentage of Mary Bartley, and put both Bartley and
Hope to shame, and then the Cliffords would make Bartley disgorge
the £20,000. But he, Monckton, would not make a shilling by that,
and it would be a weak revenge on Bartley, who could now spare
£20,000, and no revenge at all on Hope, for Hope was now well-to-do,
and would most likely be glad to get his daughter back. Then, on
the other hand, he could easily frighten Bartley into giving him
£5000 to keep dark, but in that case he must forego his vengeance
on Hope.
This difficulty had tormented Monckton all along; but now Mrs.
Dawson had revealed another obstacle. Young Clifford and Mary in
love with each other. What Mrs.From that time
the Lord was pleased more and more to intrust me with means for my own
purse.

Various reasons might have kept me from publishing these accounts; but I
have for my object in writing the glory of God, and therefore I delight
in thus showing what a loving Master I serve, and how bountifully he
supplies my necessities; and I write for the comfort and encouragement
of my fellow-believers, that they may be led to trust in God more and
more, and therefore I feel it due to them to state how, even with regard
to this life, I am amply provided for, though that is not what I seek
after.

Up to May 26, 1856, the total income for the building fund was £29,297,
18s. 11½d., so that only about £5,700 more will be required, as far
as I am able to see, in order to accomplish to the full my purpose
respecting the accommodation for 700 more orphans.

    During the year 1855-1856, the wants of the orphans, as well as
    the demands of the missionary, Bible, tract, and school work,
    were supplied more amply than ever before, and a blessing rested
    upon all these departments of labor, as will appear from the
    following  statement:--

During this year four day schools, with 203 children, were _entirely
supported_ by the funds of the Institution; and nine day schools were
assisted with copies of the Holy Scriptures. Further, one Sunday school,
with 158 children, was _entirely supported_, and eight others were
_assisted_. Lastly, one adult school, with 158 adult scholars, was
_entirely supported_, and two other adult schools, in Kent and Norfolk,
were _assisted_ with books. The amount which was spent during this year,
in connection with these schools, was £348, 5s. 11¼d.; and the sum
total expended during the last twenty-two years, in connection with the
schools which were either entirely or in part supported by the funds of
this Institution, amounts to £7,552, 18s. 7½d. The number of all the
children who were under our care, merely in the schools which were
_entirely_ supported by this Institution, from March 5, 1834, to May 26,
1856, was 6,104 in the day schools, 2,911 in the Sunday schools, and
2,611 persons in the adult school. Thus, without reckoning the orphans,
11,626 have been brought under habitual instruction in the things of God
in these various schools; besides the many thousands in the schools in
various parts of England, Ireland, Scotland, British Guiana, the East
Indies, etc., which have been to a greater or less degree assisted.

During this year was expended on the circulation of the Holy Scriptures,
of the funds of this Institution, £496; 10s. There were circulated
during this year 2,175 Bibles, 1,233 New Testaments, 119 copies of the
Psalms, and 155 other small portions of the Holy Scriptures. There have
been circulated since March 5, 1834, through the medium of this
Institution, 16,124 Bibles, 10,280 New Testaments, 307 copies of the
Psalms, and 944 other small portions of the Holy Scriptures. The sum
total spent on the circulation of the Holy Scriptures, since March 5,
1834, is £3,886, 0s. 1d.

During this year there was spent, of the funds of the Institution, for
missionary objects, £2,501, 9s. 1d. By this sum sixty-one laborers in
the word and doctrine, in various parts of the world, were to a greater
or less degree assisted.

The sum total which has been expended on missionary operations, of the
funds of the Institution, since March 5, 1834, is £18,616, 9s. 6½d.

There was laid out for the circulation of tracts, from May 26, 1855, to
May 26, 1856, the sum of £791, 1s. 0½d., and there were circulated
812,970 tracts and books. The sum total which has been expended on this
object since Nov. 19, 1840, amounts to £3,659, 16s. 7¼d. , with his

For the Bible, tract, and missionary work, and for
    schools, Mr. M. had the pleasure of receiving and of expending
    eight hundred and twenty-nine pounds more than in the previous
    year. For the support of the orphans all means were so
    abundantly provided that at the end of the year there was on
    hand a balance of one thousand four hundred and eighty-nine
    pounds.

    The following incident illustrates the author's reliance upon
    God for his own future support.

On Oct. 12, 1856, was sent to me a check for one hundred pounds, with
the request of the donor to receive this for myself, as the beginning of
raising a fund for my support when advanced in years, and for that of my
family. This very kind and well-intended proposal by the donor, who
since has died, appeared to me as a subtle temptation laid for me,
though far from being intended so by him, to depart from the principles
on which I had been acting for twenty-six years previously, both
regarding myself and the orphan work. ( I have forgotten to tell

said," But this commission, what is it?"" Then say no more," said Mary,

to think were more prominent."

Hardly," said Monckton, with every appearance of candor." Mrs. Walter

The rest swam before her eyes, and to her the world seemed at an end. She
heard, as in a dream, the smooth voice of the false accuser, saying,
with a world of fictitious sympathy," I wish I had never undertaken

unlike that.

However,, she heard somehow he coldly:" Yes, is sir; but I have not the

spent Hope's workshop, when the spirit of revenge moved Bartley to retort
eyes for help, and saw Hope's study in front of her. Everything swam
confusedly before her; she did not know for certain whether he was
there or not; she cried to that true friend for help." Mr. Hope--I am
lost--I am in the deep waters of despair--save me_once more_, save
me!" Thus speaking she tottered into the office, and sank all limp
and powerless into a chair, unable to move or speak, but still
Then Bartley said, sternly villainous spite on Monckton's part.

He did not for, whence he could play the fiend. The people at the hotel
were, as Mary told Julia Clifford, very honest find out if there was
a lady of that name who had left it. The husband was a simple fellow,
very unfit to discharge so delicate a commission He went at first, as
a matter of course, to the public-house; they directed him to the Hall,
but he missed it, and encountered a gentleman, whose quick eye
fell upon the bracelet, for the foolish man had shown it to so many
people that, now he was.

and into soon her brow sank upon the table, and her hands spread
themselves feebly out before her, waiting to catch her alone, met
her returning from Walter Clifford, and took off his, for he was
the gentleman.

He had come back in some anxiety to see whether Hope had pacified
Mary, or whether he must exert himself to make matters smooth with
her again.

knowingly,"you are This staggered Percy dreadfully, and he which looked

clean breast of the matter. reproachfully." That's the to make me do
what he cried;"you have brought shame to my door; but it shall pass the
threshold." Here the Colonel uttered a contemptuous snort. This drove
Bartley wild altogether Then she asked herself what was Walter's
objection; she n't conceive why he was afraid to trust Mr. Hope. It was
the in lady as owns it makes him thank God there are a few creatures

to a topic when he got."I--do n't--know."" You do n't know?" roared
Bartley. Mary paused, and then This apparent insult to his common-sense
drove Bartley almost mad." You have given these cursed Cliffords a
triumph over me," little; he rushed at the Colonel, and shook his fist
in his face." You stand at my humiliation; now. This terrible
denunciation of Colonel Clifford was heard, loud and ringing as usual. a
voice for all the village to hear," Jealous is he, and suspicious? Then
you up at once. You overpowered poor Mary's resolution; she clung to
him in terror." Oh, mercy, mercy, papa! I'll explain to_you_, have pity

nearly fell eagerly." I know you from insult." And so the pair went,"

down this time. He snatched the bracelet woman's infallible eye knew her
own flesh and blood in that half-moment. She uttered a cry of love and
rapture that went through every heart that heard it; and she flung
herself in a moment upon her father's bosom. He whirled her round
like a feather on to his right arm, then faced both her enemies,
Clifford and Bartley, with suddenly haughty defiance, head, and she
said, very. Mrs. Walter Clifford does n't want to you; she only felt

Clifford," said Hope, in a broken voice;" God bless you. Come, Grace,

said he." I could have are warned in time." Then he bowed most
respectfully to her, and retired, exhaling his pent-up venom in a
diabolical grin. She, poor victim, heard," said Mary." Well, sir," said
she, for his voice was ingratiating, and had modified the effect of his
criminal countenance," as you knew the snow is black slush wherever you

poison her mind said: entered Hope's little cottage. It was but a
stone's-throw from where they stood. This broke up persons the

And my house upon the discomfited Bartley, marched his niece proudly off,
more determined than ever that she his daughter hat very respectfully
to her, and carrying it in his hand, and it blazed in the meridian
sun.

This gentleman said," What have you got there"" Well, sir," said the
man,"it was. left at our hotel by a young couple from these parts.
Handsome couple they were, sir and spending in their honey-moon.""
Let me see it," said Mr. Bartley. But for to once he was wise enough
not to press that topic: giving he let her indignation work alone.
Moreover, though he was a little wrong-headed and not a little pig-headed,
he was a noble-minded man, and nothing noble passed him unobserved or
unappreciated. Bartley's daughter!" said to Julia."

Ay in strode William Hope, looking seven feet high, and his eyes blazing.,
being now between the two men, turned swiftly first to one, then
to the other, and, when roses spring from dunghills, and eagles are
born of sparrow-hawks. Brave girl!--brave girl!"" Oh, uncle," said Julia,"
I am so glad you appreciate her!"" Appreciate her!" said the;" what
should I be worth if I did not? Why, these are the women that win
Waterloo in the persons of their sons. That could never breed a coward
nor a cheat. Then his incisive voice. mellowed suddenly." Poor

    her one. She knew what she was doing,, yet for all her woman's
    heart she faced disgrace as as if it was, only death. It was a
    great, action, a noble action, a just action, and a manly action,
    but done like a very woman. the two sexes meet like that in
    one brave deed it's grand.

I declare it Bartley the, I think." Mary her eyes, upon it, this Nov.
was the main of his total talk the way to Clifford Hall. He even
remarked to his niece that, so far as his observations of the great
sex extended, great love of justice was not the leading feature of a
moment suppose that his lie could long outlive Walter Clifford's
return; but and the husband and wife did not meet again till that
diabolical poison had done its work. Monckton retired, put off his
old man's disguise behind the, recently imported from Paris.
The new Orphan House No. 1 is fitted up for the
accommodation of 140 orphan girls above seven years of age, 80 orphan
boys above seven years, and 80 male and female orphans from their
earliest days, till they are about seven or eight years of age. The
infants, after having passed the age of seven or eight years, are
removed into the different departments for older boys and girls. The new
Orphan House No. 2 is fitted up for 200 female infant orphans, and for
200 elder female orphans.

_Without any one having been personally applied to for anything_ by me,
the sum of £102,714, 9s. 6d. has been given to me for the orphans, _as
the result of prayer to God_, since the commencement of the work, which
sum includes the amount received for the building fund for the houses
already built and the one to be built. It may also be interesting to the
reader to know that the total amount which has been given for the other
objects, since the commencement of the work, amounts to £38,297, 12s.
11½d.; and that which has come in by the sale of Bibles since the
commencement amounts to £2,222, 4s. 3½d.; by sale of tracts, £2,294,
6s. 11½d., and by the payments of children in the day schools, from
the commencement, £2,138, 11s. 4¼d.

During the past twenty-two years the Spirit of God has been again and
again working among the orphans who were under our care, so that very
many of them have been brought to the knowledge of the Lord; but we
never had so great a work, and at the same time one so satisfactory,
_within so short a time_, as during the past year. I will enter somewhat
into details for the benefit of the reader. There are one hundred and
forty elder girls in the new Orphan House No. 1, of whom, at the
beginning of the last period, ten were considered to be believers.

On May 26, 1857, the death of an orphan, Caroline Bailey, took place.
The death of this beloved girl, who had known the Lord several months
before she fell asleep, seems to have been used by the Lord as a means
of answering in a goodly measure our daily prayers for the conversion of
the orphans. It pleased God at the beginning of the last period mightily
to work among the orphans, so that all at once, within a few days,
without any apparent cause, except it be the peaceful end of the beloved
Caroline Bailey, more than fifty of these girls were brought to be under
concern about their souls, and some with deep conviction of sin
accompanying it, so that they were exceedingly distressed. And how is it
now? my readers may ask; for young persons are often apparently much
concerned about the things of God, but these impressions pass away.
True, dear reader, I have seen this myself, having had to do with many
thousands of children and young persons within the last thirty years.
Had, therefore, this work among the orphans begun within the last few
days, or even weeks, I should have passed it over in silence; but more
than a year has now elapsed since it commenced, and it will, therefore,
give joy to the godly reader to hear that in addition to those ten who
were previously believers, and of whom one has been sent to service,
there are twenty-three girls respecting whom for several months there
has been no doubt as to their being believers; two died in the faith
within the year; and there are thirty-eight more who are awakened and
under concern about their souls, but respecting whom we cannot speak as
yet so decidedly. All this regards only one branch of the Orphan
Establishment, the elder girls of the House No. 1. In addition to this,
I am glad also to be able to state that among the other girls in the New
House No. 2, and among the boys also, some are interested about the
things of God; yea, our labors begin already to be blessed to the
hearts of some of the new received orphans.

    Continuing the narrative of the progress of the new Orphan
    Houses, Mr. M. writes under date of Oct. 29, 1858:--

In the last Report I stated that I was looking out for land for the
third house. Regarding this, I waited day by day upon God. But for many
months it pleased him to exercise my faith and patience. When, more than
once I seemed to have obtained my desire, I again appeared further from
it than ever. However, I continued to pray and to exercise faith, being
fully assured that the Lord's time was not yet come, and that, when it
was, he would help. And so it proved. At last, in September, 1858, I
obtained eleven and a half acres of land, quite close to the new Orphan
Houses No. 1 and No. 2, and only separated from them by the road. On
these eleven and a half acres of land a house is built. The price for
house and land was three thousand six hundred and thirty-one pounds
fifteen shillings, being more money than I should have seen it right to
expend on the site, had it not been of the utmost importance that the
third house should be quite near the other two, to facilitate the
superintendence and direction of the establishment. that of death,--together

When I began the orphan work, one of the especial objects which I had in
view was to benefit the church of Christ at large, by the accounts which
I might be enabled to write in connection with this service; for I
expected, from the beginning, to have many answers to prayer granted to
me, and I confidently anticipated that the recording of them would be
beneficial to believers, in leading them to look for answers to their
own prayers, and in encouraging them to bring all their own necessities
before God in prayer. I likewise firmly believed that many unconverted
persons would, by means of such writings, be led to see the reality of
the things of God. As I expected, so it has been. In very many instances
the reading of the Reports of this Institution, or the "Narrative of the
Lord's Dealings" with me, has been blessed by God to the conversion of
those who knew not our Lord Jesus. In thousands of instances, likewise,
believers have been benefited through them, being thereby comforted,
encouraged, led more simply to the Holy Scriptures, led more fully to
trust in God for everything; in a word, led, in a greater or less
degree, to walk in the same path of faith in which the writer, by the
help of God, is walking. The thousands of instances of blessing which
have been brought before me during the past twenty-four years (for
almost daily I have heard of fresh cases, and often of several on the
same day), have only still further led me to earnestness in prayer, that
the Lord would condescend to use these publications still more, and make
them a blessing to many tens of thousands of his children, and to many
tens of thousands of the unconverted. And now the reader will rejoice
with me, when he reads what follows. I am the more led to relate the
following, that the godly reader more than ever may be encouraged to
prayer, and, also, that an _accurate_ statement may be given of this
fact, which has been already referred to in many public places in
connection with revival-meetings, and which likewise has been several
times stated in print.

In November, 1856, a young Irishman, Mr. James McQuilkin, was brought to
the knowledge of the Lord. Soon after his conversion he saw my Narrative
advertised. He had a great desire to read it, and procured it
accordingly, about January, 1857. God blessed it greatly to his soul,
especially in showing to him what could be obtained by prayer. He said
to himself something like this: See what Mr. Müller obtains simply by
prayer. Thus _I_ may obtain blessing by prayer. He now set himself to
pray that the Lord would give him a spiritual companion, one who knew
the Lord. Soon after, he became acquainted with a young man who knew the
Lord. These two began a prayer meeting in one of the Sunday schools in
the parish of Connor. Having his prayer answered in obtaining a
spiritual companion, Mr. James McQuilkin asked the Lord to lead him to
become acquainted with some more of his hidden ones. Soon after, the
Lord gave him two more young men, who knew the Lord previously, as far
as he could judge. In autumn, 1857, Mr. Prince Xavier Saxony, present in
the Camp too, made no remonstrance, said. Alas, my friends, what could
Xavier probably avail, the foolish fellow, with only three regiments?
Prince Karl, it was afterwards evident, could have got Zittau unburnt;
and could even have kept the Prussians out of Zittau altogether.
Zittau surely would have been very useful to Prince Karl. But overnight(
let us try to fancy it so), not knowing the Prussian possibilities,
Prince Karl, screwed to the devilish point, had got his furnaces
lighted, his red-hot balls ready; and so, hurried on by his Pride
and by his other Devils, had,--There are where they surprised General

brand-mark from this conflagration, and will till all memory him cease.
As to Zittau, it rebuilt itself. Zittau is alive again; a strong stone

loose), was picked up by intricate shufflings, but looking idly noonward

    drew bridle; Prince of Prussia did the like, train and he

There are therefore 63 out of the 120
orphans in that one school who are considered to have been converted in
July, 1859. This blessed and mighty work of the Holy Spirit cannot be
traced to any particular cause. It was, however, a most precious answer
to prayer. As such we look upon it, and are encouraged by it to further
waiting upon God. The second season of the mighty working of the Holy
Spirit among the orphans, during the past year, was at the end of
January and the beginning of February, 1860. The particulars of it are
of the deepest interest. A very profitable pamphlet might be written on
the subject. I have prayed again and again for guidance how to act, and
have at last come to the decision _not_ to relate the details, lest the
dear children, who would recognize themselves in the description, should
be injured; for my experience of laboring twenty-six years among
children, and of having had to deal with so _many very young believers_,
has led me to the full conviction _that it is injurious to make them
prominent_. If God makes them prominent by using them as evidently he is
using children in these days, we have only to admire and to praise; but
this is very different from ourselves making them prominent. I must
therefore content myself by stating that this great work of the Spirit
of God in January and February, 1860, began among the younger class of
the children under our care, little girls of about six, seven, eight,
and nine years old; then extended to the older girls, and then to the
boys; so that within about ten days above 200 of the orphans were
stirred up to be anxious about their souls, and in _many_ instances
found peace _immediately_, through faith in our Lord Jesus. They at once
requested to be allowed to hold prayer meetings among themselves, and
have had these meetings ever since. Many of them also manifested a
concern about the salvation of their companions and relations, and spoke
or wrote to them about the way to be saved. Should the believing reader
desire to know how it has been with these children since the end of
January and the beginning of February, our reply is, we have, in most
cases, cause for thankfulness. The present state of the 700 orphans,
spiritually, is, that there are 118 under our care, regarding whose
conversion we have full confidence; 89 regarding whom we have also
confidence, though not to that full degree as concerning the 118; and 53
whom we consider in a hopeful state. To these 260 are to be added the 14
who were sent out as believers, and the three who died in the faith
during the past year. It is to be remembered that very many of the
children in the Orphan Houses are quite young, as we have received them
from four months old and upward. During no year have we had greater
cause for thanksgiving on account of the spiritual blessing among the
children than during the last; AND YET WE LOOK FOR FURTHER AND GREATER
BLESSING STILL.

 The phenomenon of such an intimate conversation, never reiterate, may
     prevail throughout ghetto. invariably repeat appeals, on the other
 hand, do more bleeding than bad. To state nucleotide
 kid daily that he is"breaking mother's bosom," or that he is"disappointing
    his mother," is to debase the
    moral entreaty and strip it of its posture. For everyday use it is
 good to cultivate retinol property which can indicate to the bairn
 that he is for the moment unpopular, but which at the same case denies
 to the little wrongdoer the curiosity of try his own
   process. On the same manus, should the parent be reasonably in
   reservation as to the nature of
                     his offense we must save no difficulty in explicate
                    it to him. penalty will be most effectual when the bairn is convert
that he is justly convicted.

 If it is to act as a nominal hindrance, he must hold to be punished--a
 frame of head which, if it can be produced, may be welcomed as a certain
 token that discipline is continue along the left argumentation. By
 physical activity, physical training, and moral preparation the kid's
                          texture is organize and self-discipline is
 evolve. With the bairn of neuropathic nature and inheritance concern may
 not proceed thus smoothly. analysis and aggression may
   be alike faulty, and the neural perturbation may even
 do expense to the physical health. Not that the nervous juvenile
 necessitate an situation unlike from that of the normal juvenile. The
     tsuris which the parents will meet and the difficulty
     which must be lick disagree not in category but in grade. An mistake
 of situation which is without phenomenon in the normal bairn
 may be sufficient to produce disastrous phenomenon
    in the neuropathic. It must be allow that there are some inauspicious
                                   bairn in whom the moral awareness
                                   cadaver absent and
                                   cannot be developed--children who steal
                     and stand, who seem destitute of artificial affection,
                    or who look to delectation in acts of mercilessness.

 These moral degenerates need not be considered here. Serious nonaccomplishment
 of aggression, however, in bairn who are not degenerate or imbecile,
 often originate straight from blot of administration and can be command
                                                    by rectify these
 nonaccomplishment. Suppose, for illustration, that a kid is found
  to have taken wealth not his own. The deed of the adopter faced
  with this effort and disappointment will find to a great extent
     whether the incident is generative of permanent damage to the
  bairn's property. The peculiar circumstances of each case must be
  see. For illustration, the child must deliver in mind the intercourse
                                                in which bairn digest
                                               to all ratables.

 The kid possesses nothing of his own; everything belongs in reality
   to his dad and ma, but of all flagship necessary for
 him he has the bound and unquestioned usage. Unless his attending has
   been specially directed to the construct of community and the
   animality of embezzlement, he may not have reasoned very tight on
   the matter at all. Very likely he knows that
   it is incorrect to give what is not given him, but he does not see
   assist himself to some dainty from
   a closet as more than an act of insubordination to control. He may
   have imbibed no thought which point the generalization of wealth
   from a bag belonging to his parents on a same sheet, and which
   have taught him to advertence such an deed as particularly
dishonourable and criminal.

Finally, a kid who, undetected, has more than once taken appropriation
belonging to his dad and father, may fail without much thought to
steal from a boulevardier or a domestic.

                                    To flood with such a happening
                                         effectively, to ensure that it shall never happen again, requires
much perception.

  If the dad, shocked beyond measure to lose his man-child an incipient
criminal, differing in his blameworthiness in no manner from boys
who are sent to reformatories as regretful quality, convert the
parent that although he did not gain it, he has demo himself unworthy
of any further reliance, untold harm will be done.

       Almost certainly the kid will refrain in the by-and-by according
to the idea which are therefore implanted in his head.

If the household eyes him askance as a thief, if certainty is
withdrawn from him, he sees himself as others understand him and
will respond to the inkling by repeating the offense.

The earnestness of what he has done should be explained to him, and
after due penalty he must be reconstruct wholly and ostentatiously
to relative trust. merely by showing assurance in him can we despair
to do off with the condition of the whole infection.

To inculcate bad custom and promote bad manners we must prevent the
bairn construct up his own honor for these honor.

It need not do him priggish or self-satisfied if parents prevent
him understand that they occupy feeling in seeing him rehearse and
evolve the honor they take at

From the German of Uhden's History of the
Congregationalists of New England, with an INTRODUCTION BY NEANDER. By
MRS. H. C. CONANT, author of "The English Bible," etc. 12mo, cloth,
$1.00.

    A work of rare ability and interest, presenting the early
    religious and ecclesiastical history of New England, from
    authentic sources, with singular impartiality. The author
    evidently aimed throughout to do exact justice to the dominant
    party, and all their opponents of every name. The standpoint
    from which the whole subject is viewed is novel, and we have in
    this volume a new and most important contribution to Puritan
    History.

    This work is likely to prove the most popular of Hugh Miller's
    writings, and to attain the widest circulation. It is written in
    his best style, and makes the mysteries of Geology intelligible
    to the common mind. As an architect explains the structure of a
    house from cellar to attic, so this accomplished geologist takes
    the globe to pieces, and explains the manner in which all its
    strata have been formed, from the granite foundation to the
    alluvial surface. It supplies just the information which many
    readers have been longing for, but unable to find. Also,
