THE SKELETON ON ROUND ISLAND

From "Mackinac And Lake Stories", 1899

By Mary Hartwell Catherwood


_On the 15th day of March, 1897, Ignace Pelott died at Mackinac Island,
aged ninety-three years._

Jerrold's Biography is still unwritten.

I think I will wait till some
other day when I can get back from Cheboygan; for what will she say if
I stop the traino when we have such a long journey, and it is so near
night, and the strait almost ready to move? So I crack the whip, but
something pull, pull! I cannot go on! I say to myself, "The ground is
froze; how can I cover up that skeleton without any shovel, or even a
hatchet to break the earth?"

But something pull, pull, so I am oblige to stop, and the dogs turn in
without one word and drag the sledge up the beach of Bound Island.

The exhibitions appear to have been calculated for the lower class of
people, and to have been more frequent than those at the Blackfriars,
till 1604 or 5, when it became less fashionable and frequented.

Being contiguous to the Bear Garden, it is probable that those who
resorted there went to the theatre, when the bear-baiting sports were
over, and such persons were not likely to form a very refined audience.

We have no description of the interior of the Globe, but that it
was somewhat similar to our modern theatres, with an open space in
the roof:
or perhaps it more resembled an inn-yard, where, in the beginning
of Queen Elizabeth's reign, many of our ancient dramatic pieces
were performed.

The galleries in both were arranged on three sides of the building; the
small rooms under the lowest, answered to our present boxes and were
called rooms; the yard bears a sufficient resemblance to the pit, as at
present in use, and where the common people stood to see the exhibition;
from which circumstance they are called by Shakspeare "the _groundlings_,"
and by Ben Jonson, "the _understanding_ gentlemen of the _ground_."

The stage was erected in the area, with its back to the gateway where the
admission money was taken. The price of admission into the best
_rooms_, or boxes, was in Shakspeare's time, a shilling, though afterwards
it appears to have risen to two shillings and half-a-crown.

The galleries, or scaffolds, as they were sometimes called, and that part
of the house which in private theatres was named the pit, seem to have
been the same price, which was sixpence, while in some meaner
playhouses it was only a penny, and in others two-pence.

We learn from Sir Henry Hebert, that 20_l_. was the greatest receipt for
one day's performance; by that we may calculate upon the house
having contained about 700 persons, at the prices before stated;
that is to say, 100 for the boxes, and the rest in the other parts
of the house.

Part of the site of this theatre is now occupied by the brewery of
Messrs.

Barclay and Perkins; and in the _History of St. Saviour's_, already
quoted, we read that "the passage which led to the Globe Tavern,
of which the playhouse formed a part, was, till within these few
years, known by the name of Globe Alley, and upon its site now
stands a large store-house for porter."

The _Rose_ or smaller theatre, was erected in the year 1592, and is
stated to have cost £103. 2_s_. 7_d_.

--a sum which would scarcely pay half the expenses of a modern patent
theatre for a single night!

These theatres appear to have been cited as nuisances by the parish
officers of St.

Saviour's, in which they stood; for in July, 1597-8, a resolution
was agreed to by a vestry of the parish, "that a petition shall be
made to the bodye of the Councell, (Privy Council,) concerning the
play-houses in this parish; wherein all the enormities shall be
showed that come thereby to the parish, and that in respect thereof
they may be dismissed, and put down from playing: and that four,
or two of the Churchwardens, &c. shall present the cause with a
collector of the Boroughside, and another of the Bankside."

He had., wrote in","--started a newspaper,--started kinds of
work on hand He brought out occasionally a five-act comedy, full the as
usual of wit of a magazine,--published a romance,--all a few each other.
We have
plenty meat, and I sing like a voyageur while I build the fire. Drift,
so dry in summer you can light it with a coal from your pipe, lay on the
beach, but is now winter-soaked, and I make a fireplace of logs, and cut
pine branches to help it.

It is all thick woods on Round Island, so close it tear you to pieces if
you try to break through; only four-footed things can crawl there. When
the fire is blazing up I take my knife and cut a tunnel like a little
room, and pile plenty evergreen branches. Presently it turns out, that
by putting his hand to his heart he can draw away bank-notes,--only
that it is his life he is drawing away. The conception is fine and
imaginative, and ought to rank with the best of those philosophical
stories so fashionable in the last century. Its working-out in the every-day
part is brilliant and pungent; and much ingenuity is shown in connecting
the tragic and mysterious element in Jericho's life with the ordinary,
vain, worldly existence of his wife and daughters. It is startling to
find ourselves in the regions of the impossible, just as we are
beginning to know the persons of the fable.

But the mind reassures itself. This Jericho, with his mysterious fate,--is
not he, in this twilight of fiction, shadowing to us the real destiny of
real money-grubbers whom we may see any day about our doors? Has not
the money become the very life of many such?

And so feeling, the reader goes pleasantly on,--just excited a little, and
raised out of the ordinary temperature in which fiction is read, by the
mystic atmosphere through which he sees things,--and ends, acknowledging
that with much pleasure he has also gathered a good moral.

For his mere amusement the best fireworks have been cracking round him on
his journey. In short, I esteem this Jerrold's best book,--the one which
contains most of his mind. Certain aspects of his mind, indeed, may be
seen even to better advantage in others of his works; his sentimental
side, for instance, in "Clovernook," where he has let his fancy run
riot like honeysuckle, and overgrow every thing; his wit in "Time works
Wonders," which blazes with epigrams like Vauxhall with lamps. But "A
Man made of Money" is the completest of his books as a creation, and the
most characteristic in point of style,--is based on a principle which
predominated in his mind,--is the most original in imaginativeness,
and the best sustained in point and neatness, of the works he has
left.

During the years of which I have just been speaking, Jerrold lived
chiefly in a villa at Putney, and afterwards at St.

John's Wood,--the mention of which fact leads me to enter on a description
of him in his private, social, and friendly relations. Now-a-days it
is happily expected of every man who writes of another to recognize his
humanity,--not to treat him as a machine for the production of
this or that--scientific, or literary, or other--material.

_Homo sum_ is the motto of the biographer, and so of the humbler
biographic sketcher. Jerrold is just one of those who require and reward
this kind of personal sympathy and attention;--so radiant was the man of
all that he put into his books!--so quick, so warm, so full of
light and life, wit and impulse!

He was one of the few who in their conversation entirely come up
to their renown.

He sparkled wherever you touched him, like the sea at night.

The first thing I have to remark, in treating of Jerrold the man, is
the entire harmony between that figure and Jerrold the writer. He talked
very much as he wrote, and he acted in life on the principles which
he advocated in literature. He united, remarkably, simplicity of
character with brilliancy of talk. For instance, with all his success,
he never sought higher society than that which he found himself gradually
and by a natural momentum borne into, as he advanced. He never suppressed
a flash of indignant sarcasm for fear of startling the "genteel"
classes and Mrs.

Grundy. He never aped aristocracy in his household. He would go
to a tavern for his oysters and a glass of punches simply as they
did in Ben Jonson's days; and I have heard of his doing so from a
sensation of boredom at a very great house indeed,--a house for the
sake of an admission to which, half Bayswater would sell their
grandmothers' bones to a surgeon.

This kind of thing stamped him in our polite days as one of the old
school, and was exceedingly refreshing to observe in an age when the
anxious endeavour of the English middle classes is to hide their
plebeian origin under a mockery of patrician elegance.

He had none of the airs of success or reputation,--none of the affectations,
either personal or social, which are rife everywhere. He was manly and
natural,--free and off-handed to the verge of eccentricity. Independence
and marked character seemed to breathe from the little, rather bowed
figure, crowned with a lion-like head and falling light hair,--to
glow in the keen, eager, blue eyes glancing on either side as he
walked along.

Nothing could be less commonplace, nothing less conventional, than
his appearance in a room or in the streets.

His quick, impulsive nature made him a great talker, and conspicuously
convivial,--yea, convivial, at times, up to heights of vinous glory
which the Currans and Sheridans shrank not from, but which a
respectable age discourages.

And here I must undertake the task of saying something about his
conversational wit,--so celebrated, yet so difficult (as is notoriously
the case with all wits) to do justice to on paper.
