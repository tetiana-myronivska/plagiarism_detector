AND when the time of his
circumcision was come: namely,
the eighth day, on which the
law commanded the child to be
circumcised; they circumcised
him in the cave.

2  And the old Hebrew woman
took the foreskin (others say she
took the navel-string), and preserved
it in an alabaster-box of old oil
of spikenard.

3  And she had a son who was a
druggist, to whom she said, Take
heed thou sell not this alabaster-
box of spikenard-ointment, although
thou shouldst be offered three
hundred pence for it.

4  Now this is that alabaster-
box which Mary the sinner procured,
and poured forth the ointment out
of it upon the head and the feet
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and wiped
them off with the hairs of her head.

5  Then after ten days they
brought him to Jerusalem, and on
the fortieth day from his birth
they presented him in the temple
before the Lord, making the proper
offerings for him, according
to the requirement of the law of
Moses: namely, that every male
which opens the womb shall be
called holy unto God.

6  At that time old Simeon saw
him shining as a pillar of light,
when St. Mary the Virgin, his
mother, carried him in her arms,
and was filled with the greatest
pleasure at the sight.

7  And the angels stood around
him, adoring him, as a king's
guards stand around him.

8  Then Simeon going near to
St. Mary, and stretching forth his
hands towards her, said to the
Lord Christ, Now, O My Lord,
thy servant shall depart in peace,
according to thy word;

9  For mine eyes have seen thy
mercy, which thou hast prepared
for the salvation of all nations;
a light to all people, and the glory
of thy people Israel.

10  Hannah the prophetess was
also present, and drawing near,
she gave praises to God, and
celebrated the happiness of Mary.


CHAPTER III.

     1 The wise men visit Christ. Mary gives them
     one of his swaddling clothes.
     3 An angel appears to them in the form of a star.
     4 They return and make a fire, and worship the
     swaddling cloth, and put it in the fire where it
     remains unconsumed.

AND it came to pass, when the
Lord Jesus was born at Bethlehem,
a city of Judaea, in the time of Herod
the King;--the wise men came from the
East to Jerusalem, according to the
prophecy of Zoradascht, [Zoroaster]
and brought with them offerings:
namely, gold, frankincense, and myrrh,
and worshipped him, and offered to him
their gifts.

2  Then the Lady Mary took one
of his swaddling clothes in which
the infant was wrapped, and gave
it to them instead of a blessing,
which they received from her as a
most noble present.

3  And at the same time there
appeared to them an angel in the
form of that star which had before
been their guide in their journey;
the light of which they followed
till they returned into their own
country.

4  On their return their kings
and princes came to them inquiring,
whom they had seen and done?
What sort of journey and return
they had?  What Company
they had on the road?

5  But they produced the swaddling
cloth which St. Mary had given
them, on account whereof they kept
a feast.

6  And having, according to the
custom of their country, made
a fire, they worshipped it.

7  And casting the swaddling
cloth into it, the fire took it
and kept it.

8  And when the fire was put out,
they took forth the swaddling cloth
unhurt, as much as if the fire had
not touched it.

9  Then they began to kiss it,
and put it upon their heads and
their eyes saying, This is certainly
an undoubted truth, and it is really
surprising that the fire could not
burn it, and consume it.

10  Then they took it, and with
the greatest respect laid it up
among their treasures.


CHAPTER IV.

     1 Herod intends to put Christ to death.
     3 An angel warns Joseph to take the child
     and his mother into Egypt.
     6 Consternation on their arrival.
     13 The idols fall down.
     15 Mary washes Christ's swaddling clothes, hangs them to
     dry on a post, and the son of a priest puts one on his head;
     16 And being possessed of devils they leave him.

NOW Herod perceiving that the
wise men did delay and not return
to him, called together the priest
and wise men, and said, Tell me in
what place the Christ should be born.

2  And when they replied, in
Bethlehem,--a city of Judaea, he
began to contrive in his own mind
the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.

3  But an angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in his sleep,
and said, Arise, take the child and
his mother, and go into Egypt as soon
as the cock crows. So he arose,
and went.

4  And as he was considering
with himself about his journey,
the morning came upon him.

5  In the length of the journey
the girts of the saddle broke.

6  And now he drew near to a great
city, in which there was an idol,
to which the priests of the other
idols and gods of Egypt brought
their offerings and vows.

7  And there was by this idol a
priest ministering to it, who, as
often as Satan spoke out of that
idol, related the things he said to
the inhabitants of Egypt, and those
countries.

8  This priest had a son three
years old, who was possessed with
a great multitude of devils, who
uttered many strange things and
when the devils seized him, walked
about naked with his clothes torn,
throwing stones at those whom
he saw.

9  Near to that idol was the inn
of the city, into which when Joseph
and St. Mary were come, and had
turned into that inn, all the
inhabitants of the city were
astonished.

10  And all the magistrates and
priests of the idols assembled
before that idol, and made inquiry
there, saying, What means all this
consternation, and dread, which
has fallen upon all our country?

11  The idol answered them,
The unknown God is come thither,
who is truly God; nor is there any
one besides him, who is worthy of
divine worship for he is truly the
Son of God.

12  At the fame of him this
country trembled, and at his
coming it is under the present
commotion and consternation, and
we ourselves are afrighted by the
greatness of his power.

13  And at the same instant this
idol fell down, and at his fall all
the inhabitants of Egypt, besides
others ran together.

14  But the son of the priest,
when his usual disorder came upon
him going into the inn, found
there Joseph and St. Mary, whom
all the rest had left behind and
forsook.

15  And when the Lady St. Mary
had washed the swaddling clothes
of the Lord Christ, and hanged
them out to dry upon a post, the
boy possessed with the devil took
down one of them, and put it upon
his head.

16  And presently the devils
began to come out of his mouth,
and fly away in the shape of crows
and serpents.

17  From that time the boy was
healed by the power of the Lord
Christ and he began to sing
praises, and give thanks to the
Lord who had healed him.

18  When his father saw him
restored to his former state of
health, he said, My son, what has
happened to thee, and by what
means wert thou cured?

19  The son answered, When the
devils seized me, I went into the
inn, and there found a very
handsome woman with a boy, whose
swaddling clothes she had just
before washed, and hanged out upon
a post.

20  One of these I took, and put
it upon my head, and immediately
the devils left me, and fled away.

21  At this the father exceedingly
rejoiced, and said, My son,
perhaps this boy is the son of the
living God, who made the heavens
and the earth.

22  For as soon as he came
amongst us, the idol was broken,
and all the gods fell down, and
were destroyed by a greater power.

23  Then was fulfilled the prophecy
which saith, Out of Egypt I have
called my son.


CHAPTER V.

     1 Joseph and Mary leave Egypt.
     3 Go to the Haunts of robbers,
     4 Who hearing a mighty noise,
     as of a great army flee away.

NOW Joseph and Mary when
they heard that the idol was
fallen down and destroyed, were
seized with fear and, trembling,
and said, When we Were in the
land of Israel, Herod, intending
to kill Jesus, slew for that purpose
all the infants at Bethlehem, and
that neighbourhood.

2  And there is no doubt but
the Egyptians if they come to
hear that this idol is broken and
fallen down, will burn us with fire.

3  They went therefore hence to
the secret places of robbers, who
robbed travellers as they pass by,
of their carriages and their clothes
and carried them away bound.

4  These thieves upon their
coming heard a great noise such
as the noise of a king with a great
army, and many horse and the
trumpets sounding at his departure
from his own city, at which they
were so affrighted, as to leave
all their booty behind them and
fly away in haste.

5  Upon this the prisoners arose,
and loosed each other's bonds,
and taking each man his bags,
they went way, and saw Joseph
and Mary coming towards them,
and inquired, Where is that king,
the noise of whose approach the
robbers heard, and left us,
so that we are now come off safe?

6  Joseph answered, He will come
after us.


CHAPTER VI.

     1 Mary looks on a woman in whom Satan had taken
     up his abode, and she becomes dispossessed.
     5 Christ kissed by a bride made dumb by sorcerers,
     cures her.
     11 Miraculously cures a gentlewoman in whom Satan
     had taken up his abode.
     16 A leprous girl cured by the water in which he was
     washed, and becomes the servant of Joseph and Mary.
     20 The leprous son of a prince's wife cured in like manner.
     37 Has mother offers large gifts to Mary, and dismisses her.


THEN they went into another
city where there was a woman
possessed with a devil, and in
whom Satan, that cursed rebel,
had taken up his abode.

2  One night, when she went to
fetch water, she could neither
endure her clothes on, nor to be
in any house; but as often as they
tied her with chains or cords, she
brake them, and went out into desert
places, and sometimes standing
where roads crossed, and in
church yards, would throw stones
at men.

3  When St. Mary saw this
woman, she pitied her; where
upon Satan presently left her, and
fled away in the form of a young
man, saying, Wo to me, because
of thee, Mary, and thy son.

4  So the woman was delivered
from her torment; but considering
herself naked, she blushed,
and avoided seeing any man and
having put on her clothes, went
home, and gave an account of her
case to her father and relations
who, as they were the best of the
city, entertained St. Mary and
Joseph with the greatest respect.

5  The next morning having
received a sufficient supply of
provisions for the road, they went
from them, and about the evening of
the day arrived at another town,
where a marriage was then about
to be solemnized; but by the arts
of Satan and the practices of a
sorcerers, the bride was become
so dumb, that she could not so
much as open her mouth.

6  But when this dumb bride
saw the Lady St. Mary entering
into the town, and carrying
Lord Christ in her arms, she
stretched out her hands to the
Lord Christ, and-took him in her
arms, and closely hugging him,
very often kissed him, continually
moving him and, pressing him to
her body.

7  Straightway the string of her
tongue was loosed, and her ears
were opened, and she began to
sing praises unto God, who had
restored her.

8  So there was great joy among
the inhabitants of the town that
night, who thought that God and
his angels were come down among
them.

9  In this place they abode
three days, meeting with the greatest
respect and most splendid entertainment.

10  And being then furnished by
the people with provisions for the
road, they departed and went to
another city, in which they were
inclined to lodge, because it was a
famous place.

11  There was in this city a
gentlewoman, who, as she went down
one day to the river to bathe, behold
cursed Satan leaped upon her in the
form of a serpent.

12  And folded himself about her
belly, and every night lay upon
her.

13  This woman seeing the Lady
St. Mary, and the Lord Christ the
infant in her bosom, asked the
Lady St. Mary, that she would
give her the child to kiss, and
carry in her arms.

14  When she had consented,
and as soon as the woman had
moved the child, Satan left her,
and fled away, nor did the woman
ever afterwards see him.

15  Hereupon all the neighbors
praised the Supreme God, and the
woman reward them with ample,
beneficence.

16  On the morrow, the same
woman brought perfumed water to
wash the Lord Jesus; and when
she had washed him, she preserved
the water.

17  And there was a girl there,
whose body was white with a
leprosy, who being sprinkled with
this water, and washed, was
instantly cleansed from her leprosy.

18  The people therefore said
Without doubt Joseph and Mary,
and that boy are Gods, for they do
not look like mortals.

19  And when they were making
ready to go away, the girl, who
had been troubled with the leprosy,
came and desired they would
permit her to go along with them;
so they consented and the girl went
with them till they came to a city
in which was the palace of a great
king, and whose house was not far
from the inn.

20  Here they staid, and when
the girl went one day to the
prince's wife, and found her in a
sorrowful and mournful condition,
she asked her the reason of her
tears.

21  She replied, wonder not at
my groans, for I am under a great
misfortune, of which I dare not
tell any one.

22  But, says the, girl, if you
will entrust me with your private
grievance, perhaps I may find you
a remedy for it.

23  Thou, therefore, says the
prince's wife, shall keep the
secret, and not discover it to
any one alive.

24  I have been married to this
prince, who rules as king over
large dominions, and lived long
with him before he had any child
by me.

25  At length I conceived by
him, but alas! I brought forth a
leprous son; which, when he saw
him would not own to be his, but
said to me,

26  Either do thou kill him, or
send him to some nurse in such a
place, that he may be never heard
of; and now take care of yourself;
I will never see you more.

27  So here I pine, lamenting
my wretched and miserable
circumstances. Alas, my son! alas,
my husband; Have I disclosed it
to you?

28  The girl replied I have found
a remedy for your disease, which
I promise you, for I also was
leprous, but God hath cleansed
me, even he who is called Jesus
the son of the Lady Mary.

29  The woman inquiring where
that God was, whom she spake
of; the girl answered, He lodges
with you here, in the same house.

30  But how can this be? says
she; where is he? Behold, replied
the girl, Joseph and Mary; and
the infant who is, with them is
called Jesus; and it is he who
delivered me from my disease and
torment.

31  But by what means, says she,
were you cleansed from your leprosy?
Will not you tell me that?

32  Why not? says the girl; I
took the water with which his
body had been washed, and poured
it upon me, and my leprosy
vanished.

33  The prince's wife then arose
and entertained them, providing a
great feast for Joseph among a
large company of men.

34  And the next day took
perfumed water to wash the Lord
Jesus, and afterwards poured the
same water upon her son, whom
she had brought with her, and her
son was instantly cleansed from
his leprosy,

35  Then she sang thanks and
unto God, and said, Blessed
is the mother that bare thee,
O Jesus!

36  Dost thou thus cure men of
the same nature with thyself, with
the water with which thy body is
washed?

37 She then offered very large
gifts to the Lady Mary, and sent
her away with all imaginable
respect.


CHAPTER VII.

     1 A man who could not enjoy his wife, freed from his disorder.
     5 A young man who had been bewitched, and turned into a
     mule miraculously cured by Christ being put on his back,
     28 and is married to the girl who had been cured of leprosy.


THEY came afterwards to another
city, and had a mind to lodge there.


2  Accordingly they went to a man's
house, who was newly married
but by the influence of sorcerers
could not enjoy his wife.

3  But they lodging at his house
that night, the man was freed of
his disorder.

4  And when they were preparing
early in the morning to go forward
on their journey, the new-married
person hindered them, and
provided a noble entertainment
for them.

5  But going forward on the
morrow, they came to another
city, and saw three women going
from a certain grave with great
weeping.

6  When St. Mary saw them, she
spake to the girl who was their
companion, saying, Go and inquire
of them, what is the matter with
them, and what misfortune has
befallen them?

7  When the girl asked them,
they made her no answer, but
asked her again, Who are ye? and
where are you going? For the day
is far spent, and night is at hand.

8  We are travellers, saith the
girl, and we are seeking for an inn
to lodge at.

9  They replied, Go along with
us, and lodge with us.

10  They then followed them,
and were introduced into a new
house, well furnished with all
sorts of furniture.

11  Now it was winter-time, and
the girl went into the parlour
where these women were, and
found them weeping and lamenting
as before.

12  By them stood a mule, covered
over with silk, and an ebony collar
hanging down from his neck, whom
they kissed and were feeding.

13  But when the girl said, How
handsome, ladies, that mule is!
they replied with tears, and said,
This mule, which you see, was our
brother, born of this same mother
as we;

14  For when our father died,
and left us a very large estate, and
we had only this brother, and we
endeavoured to procure him a suitable
match, and thought he should
be married as other men, some
giddy and jealous women bewitched
him without our knowledge.

15  And we one night, a little before
day, while the doors of the house
were all shut fast, saw this our
brother was changed into a mule,
such as you now see him to be:

16  And we in the melancholy
condition in which you see us,
having no father to comfort us,
have applied to all the wise men,
magicians, and diviners in the
world, but they have been of no
service to us.

17  As often therefore as we find
ourselves oppressed with grief, we
rise and go with this our mother
to our father's tomb, where, when
we have cried sufficiently, we
return home.

18  When the girl had heard this
she said, Take courage, and cease
your fears, for you have a remedy
for your afflictions near at hand
even amoung you and in the midst
of your house.

19  For I was also leprous; but
when I saw this woman, and this
little infant with her, whose name
is Jesus, I sprinkled my body with
the water with which his mother
had washed him and I was
presently made well.

20  And I am certain that he is
also capable of relieving you under
your distress.  Wherefore arise,
go to my mistress Mary, and when
you have brought her into your
own parlour, disclose to her the
secret, at the same time earnestly
beseeching her to compassionate
your case.

21  As soon as the women had
heard the girl's discourse, they
hastened away to the Lady St.
Mary, introduced themselves to
her, and sitting down before her,
they wept.

22  And said, O our Lady St.
Mary, pity your handmaids, for
we have no head of our family, no
one elder than us; no father or
brother to go in or out before us.

23  But this mule, which you
see, was our brother, which some
women by witchcraft have brought
into this condition which you see:
we therefore entreat you to
compassionate us.

24  Hereupon St. Mary was
grieved at their case, and taking
the Lord Jesus, put him upon the
back of the mule.

25  And said to her son, O Jesus
Christ, restore (or heal) according
to thy extraordinary power this
mule, and grant him to have again
the shape of a man and a rational
creature, as he had formerly.

26  This was scarce said by the
Lady St. Mary, but the mule
immediately passed into a human
form, and became a young man
without any deformity.

27  Then he and his mother and
the sisters worshipped the Lady
St. Mary, and lifting the child
upon their heads, they kissed him,
and said, Blessed is thy mother,
O Jesus, O Saviour of the world!
Blessed are the eyes which are
so happy to see thee.

28  Then both the sisters told
their mother, saying, Of a truth,
our brother is restored to his former
shape by the help of the Lord
Jesus Christ, and the kindness
of that girl who told us of Mary
and her son.

29  And inasmuch as our brother
is unmarried, it is fit that we
marry him to this girl their
servant.

30  When they had consulted
Mary in this matter, and she had
given her consent, they made a
splendid wedding for this girl.

31  And so their sorrow being
turned into gladness, and their
mourning into mirth, they began
to rejoice, and to make merry,
and sing, being dressed in their
richest attire, with bracelets.

32  Afterwards they glorified and
praised God, saying, O Jesus, son
of David, who changest sorrow
into gladness, and mourning into
mirth!

33  After this Joseph and Mary
tarried there ten days, then went
away, having received great
respect from these people.

34  Who, when they took their
leave of them, and returned home,
cried,

35  But especially the girl.


CHAPTER VIII.

     1 Joseph and Mary pass through a country infested by robbers.
     3 Titus a humane thief, offers Dumachus, his comrade,
     forty groats to let Joseph and Mary pass unmolested.
     6 Jesus prophecies that the thieves Dumachus and Titus shall be
     crucified with him and that Titus shall go before him into paradise.
     10 Christ causes a well to spring from a sycamore tree, and Mary
     washes his coat in it.
     11 A balsam grows there from his sweat.  They go to Memphis, where
     Christ works more miracles. Return to Judea.
     15 Being warned, depart for Nazareth.


IN their journey from hence they
came into a desert country and
were told it was infested with
robbers; so Joseph and St. Mary
prepared to pass through it in the
night.

2  And as they were going along,
behold they saw two robbers asleep
in the road, and with them a great
number of robbers, who were their
confederates, also asleep.

3  The names of these two were
Titus and Dumachus; and Titus
said to Dumachus, I beseech thee
let these persons go along quietly,
that our company may not perceive
anything of them.

4  But Damachus refusing, Titus
again said, I will give thee forty
groats, and as a pledge take my
girdle, which he gave him before
he had done speaking, that he
might not open his mouth or make
a noise.

5  When the Lady St. Mary saw
the kindness which this robber did
shew them, she said to him, The
Lord God will receive thee to his
right hand and grant thee pardon
of thy sins.

6  Then the Lord Jesus answered,
and said to his mother, When
thirty years are expired, O mother,
the Jews will crucify me at
Jerusalem;

7  And these two thieves shall
be with me at the same time upon
the cross, Titus on my right hand,
and Dumachus on my left, and
from that time Titus shall go before
me into paradise;

8  And when she had said, God
forbid this should be thy lot, O
my son, they went on to a city in
which were several idols; which,
as soon as they came near to it,
was turned into hills of sand.

9  Hence they went to that
sycamore tree, which is now called
Matarea.

10  And in Materea the Lord
Jesus caused a well to spring
forth, in which St. Mary washed
his coat;

11  And a balsam is produced,
or grows, in that country, from
the sweat which ran down there
from the Lord Jesus.

12  Thence they proceeded to
Memphis, and saw Pharoah, and
abode three years in Egypt.

13  And the Lord Jesus did very
many miracles, in Egypt, which
are neither to be found in
Gospel of the Infancy nor in the
Gospel of Perfection.

14  At the end of three years
he returned out of Egypt, and
when he came near to Judea,
Joseph was afraid to enter;

15  For hearing that Herod was
dead, and that Archelaus his son
reigned in his stead, he was afraid.

16  And when he went to Judea,
an, angel of God appeared to
him, and said, O Joseph go
into the city of Nazareth, and
abide there.

17  It is strange indeed, that he,
who is the Lord of all countries,
should be thus carried backward and
forward, through so many countries.


CHAPTER IX.

2 Two sick children cured by water
wherein Christ was washed.

WHEN they came afterwards
into the city of Bethlehem,
they found there several very
desperate distempers, which became
so troublesome to children by seeing
them, that most of them died.

2  There was there a woman who
had a sick son, whom she brought,
when he was at the point of death,
to the Lady St. Mary, who saw
her when she was washing Jesus
Christ.

3  Then said the woman, O my
Lady Mary, look down upon this
my son, who is afflicted with most
dreadful pains.

4  St. Mary hearing her, said,
Take a little of that water with
which I have washed my son, and
sprinkle it upon him.

5  Then she took a little of that
water, as St. Mary had commanded,
and sprinkled it upon her son,
who being wearied with his violent
pains, was fallen asleep; and after
he had slept a little, awaked
perfectly well and recovered.

6  The mother being abundantly
glad of this success, went again to
St. Mary, and St. Mary said to
her, Give praise to God, who hath
cured this thy son.

7  There was in the same place
another woman, a neighbour of
her, whose son was now cured.

8  This woman's son was afflicted
with the same disease, and his eyes
were now almost quite shut, and
she was lamenting for him day
and night.

9  The mother of the child which
was cured, said to her, Why do
you not bring your son to St. Mary,
as I brought my son to her, when
he was in the agonies of death;
and he was cure by that water,
with which the body of her son
Jesus was washed?

10  When the woman heard her
say this, she also went, and having
procured the same water, washed
her son with it, whereupon his
body and his eyes were instantly
restored to their former state.

11  And when she brought her
son to St. Mary, and opened his
case to her, she commanded her to
give thanks to God for the recovery
of her son's health, and tell
no one what had happened.


CHAPTER X.

     1 Two wives of one man, each have a son sick.
     2 One of them named Mary, and whose son's name was Caleb,
     presents the Virgin with a handsome carpet, and Caleb is cured;
     but the son of the other wife dies,
     4 which occasions a difference between the women.
     5 The other wife puts Caleb into a hot oven, and he is
     miraculously preserved,
     9 she afterwards throws him into a well,
     and he is again preserved;
     11 his mother appeals to the Virgin against the other wife,
     12 whose downfall the Virgin prophecies,
     13 and who accordingly falls into the well,
     14 therein fulfilling a saying of old.

THERE were in the same city
two wives of one man, who
had each a son sick. One of them
was called Mary, and her son's
name was Caleb.

2  She arose, and taking her son,
went to the Lady St. Mary, the
mother of Jesus, and offered her a
very handsome carpet, saying, O
my Lady Mary accept this carpet
of me, and instead of it give me a
small swaddling cloth.

3  To this Mary agreed, and
when the mother of Caleb was
gone, she made a coat for her son
of the swaddling cloth, put it on
him, and his disease was cured;
but the son of the other wife died.

4  Hereupon there arose between
them a difference in doing
the business of the family by turns,
each her week;

5  And when the turn of Mary
the mother of Caleb came, and she
was heating the oven to bake
bread, and went away to fetch the
meal, she left her son Caleb by the
oven;

6  Whom the other wife, her
rival, seeing to be by himself,
took and cast him into the oven,
which was very hot, and then went
away.

7  Mary on her return saw her
son Caleb lying in the middle of
the oven laughing, and the oven
quite as cold as though it had not
been before heated, and knew that
her rival the other wife had thrown
him into the fire.

8  When she took him out, she
brought him to the Lady St. Mary,
and told her the story, to whom
she replied, Be quiet, I am
concerned lest thou shouldest make
this matter known.

9  After this her rival, the other
wife, as she was drawing water at
the well, and saw Caleb playing
by the well, and that no one was
near, took him, and threw him
into the well.

10  And when some men came to
fetch water from the well, they
saw the boy sitting on the
superficies of the water, and
drew him out with ropes, and were
exceedingly surprised at the child,
and praised God.

11 Then came the mother and
took him and carried him to the
Lady St. Mary, lamenting, and
saying, O my Lady, see what my
rival hath done to my son, and
how she hath cast him into the
well, and I do not question but
one time or other she will be the
occasion of his death.

12  St. Mary replied to her, God
will vindicate your injured cause.

13  Accordingly a few days after,
when the other wife came to the
well to draw water, her foot was
entangled in the rope, so that she
fell headlong into the well, and
they who ran to her assistance
found her skull broken, and bones
bruised.

14 So she came to a bad end,
and in her was fulfilled that saying
of the author, They digged a well,
and made it deep, but fell themselves
into the pit which they prepared.


CHAPTER XI.

     1 Bartholomew, when a child and sick, miraculously
     restored by being laid on Christ's bed.

ANOTHER woman in that city
had likewise two son's sick.

2  And when one was dead, the
other, who lay at the point of
death, she took in her arms to the
Lady St. Mary, and in a flood of
tears addressed herself to her,
saying,

3  O my Lady, help and relieve
me; for I had two sons, the one I
have just now buried, the other I
see is fast at the point of death
behold how I (earnestly) seek for
your from God, and pray to him.

4 Then she said, O Lord, thou
art gracious, and merciful, and
kind; thou, hast given me two
sons; one of them thou halt taken
to thyself, O spare me this other.

5  St. Mary then perceiving the
greatness of her sorrow, pitied her
and said, Do thou place thy son in
my son's bed, and cover him with
his clothes.

6  And when she had placed him
in the bed wherein Christ lay,
at the moment when his eyes were
just closed by death; as soon as
ever the small of the garments of
the Lord Jesus Christ reached the
boy, his eyes were opened, and
calling with a loud voice to his
mother, he asked for bread, and
when he had received it, he sucked
it.

7  Than his mother said, O Lady
Mary, now I am assured that the
powers of God do dwell in you, so
that thy son can cure children who
are of the same sort as himself, as
soon as they touch his garments.

8 This boy, who was thus cured,
is the same who in the Gospel is
called Bartholomew.


CHAPTER XII.

       A leprous woman healed by Christ's washing water.
     7 A princess healed by it and restored to her husband.


AGAIN, there was a leprous
woman who went to the Lady
St. Mary, the mother of Jesus,
and said, O my Lady, help me.

2  St. Mary replied, What help
does thou desire? Is it gold or
silver, or that thy body be cured
of its leprosy?

3  Who, says the woman, can
grant me this?

4  St. Mary replied to her, Wait
a little till I have washed my son
Jesus, and put him to bed.

5  The woman waited, as she
was commanded; and Mary when
she had put Jesus in bed, giving
her the water with which she had
washed his body, said, Take some
of the water, and pour it upon thy
body;

6  Which when she had done,
she instantly became clean, and
praised God, and gave thanks to
him.

7  Then she went away, after
she had abode with her three
days;

8  And going into the city, she
saw a certain prince, who had
married another princes daughter;

9  But when he came to see her,
he perceived between her eyes the
signs of leprosy like a star, and
thereupon declared the marriage
dissolved and void.

10  When the woman saw these
persons in this condition, exceeding
sorrowful, and shedding abundance
of tears, she inquired of them
the reason of their crying;

11  They replied, inquire not
into our circumstances; for we
are not able to declare our
misfortunes to any, person,
whatsoever.

12  But she still pressed and
desired them to communicate their
case to her; intimating, that she
might be able to direct them
to a remedy.

13  So when they showed the young
woman to her, and the signs
of the leprosy, which appeared
between her eyes;

14  She said, I also whom ye
see in this place, was afflicted
with the same distemper, and going
on some business to Bethlehem, I
went into a certain cave, and saw
a woman named Mary, who had a
son called Jesus.

15  She seeing me to be leprous,
was concerned for me, and gave
me some water with which she
had washed her son's body, with
that I sprinkled my body, and
became clean.

16  Then said these women, Will
you Mistress, go along with us,
and show the Lady St. Mary to
us?

17  To which she consenting,
they arose and went to the Lady
St. Mary, taking with them very
noble presents.

18  And when they came in and
offered their presents to her,
they showed the leprous young woman
whom they brought with them to
her.

19  Then said St. Mary, The
mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ
rest upon you;

20  And giving them a little of
that water, with which she had
washed the body of Jesus Christ,
she bade them wash the diseased
person with it, which when they
had done, she was presently
cured;

21 So they, and all who were
present, praised God; and being
filled with joy, they went back to
their own city, and gave praises to
God on that account.

22  Then the prince hearing that
his wife was cured, took her home
and made a second marriage, giving
thanks unto God for the recovery
of his wife's health.


CHAPTER XIII.

     1 A girl, whose blood Satan sucked receives one
     of Christ's swaddling clothes from the Virgin,
     14 Satan comes like a dragon, and she shews it to him;
     flames and burning coals proceed from it and fall upon him;
     19 he is miraculously discomfited, and leaves the girl.

THERE was also a girl, who
was afflicted by Satan,

2  For that cursed spirit did
frequently appear to her in the shape
of a dragon, and was inclined to
swallow her up, and had so sucked
out all her blood, that she looked
like a dead carcass.

3  As often as she came to herself,
with her hands wringed about
her head she would cry out, and
say, Wo, Wo is me, that there is
no one to be found, who can deliver
me from that impious dragon!

4  Her father and mother, and
all who were about her and saw
her, mourned and wept over her;

5  And all who were present
would especially be under sorrow
and in tears, when they heard her
bewailing and saying, My brethren
and friends, is here no one who can
deliver me from this murderer?

6  Then the prince's daughter,
who had been cured of her leprosy,
hearing the complaint of that girl,
went upon the top of her castle,
and saw her with her hands twisted
about her head, pouring out a flood
of tears, and all the people that
were about her in tears.

7  Then she asked the husband
of the possessed person, Whether
his wife's mother was alive? He
told her, That her father and
mother were both alive,

8  Then she ordered her mother
to be sent to her; to whom, when
she saw her coming, she said,
Is this possessed girl thy daughter?
She moaning and bewailing said,
Yes madam I bore her.

9  The prince's daughter answered,
Disclose the secret of her case to me,
for I confess to you that I was leprous,
but the Lady Mary, the mother of
Jesus Christ, healed me.

10  And if you desire your
daughter to be restored to her
former state, take her to Bethlehem,
and inquire for Mary the mother
of Jesus, and doubt not but your
daughter will be cured; for I do
not question but you will come
home with great joy at your
daughter's recovery.

11  As soon as ever she had done
speaking, she arose and went with
her daughter to the place appointed,
and to Mary, and told her the case
of her daughter.

12  When St. Mary had heard
her story, she gave her a little
of the water with which she had
washed the body of her son Jesus,
and bade her pour it upon the
body of her daughter.

13 Likewise she gave her one of
the swaddling cloths of the Lord
Jesus, and said, Take this swaddling
cloth, and shew it to thine
enemy as often as thou seest him
and she sent them away in
peace.

14  After they bad left that
city and returned home, and the
time was come in which Satan was
wont to seize her, in the same
moment this cursed spirit appeared
to her in the shape of a huge
dragon, and the girl seeing him
was afraid,

15  The mother said to her, Be
not afraid, daughter; let him alone
till he come nearer to thee! then
shew him the swaddling cloth,
which the Lady Mary gave us, and
we shall see the event.

16  Satan then coming like a
dreadful dragon, the body of the
girl trembled for fear.

17  But as soon as she had put
the swaddling cloth upon her
head, and about her eyes, and
chewed it to him, presently there
issued forth from the swaddling
cloth flames and burning coals,
and fell upon the dragon.

18  Oh! how great a miracle was
this, which was done: as soon as
the dragon saw the swaddling
cloth of the Lord Jesus, fire went
forth and was scattered upon his
head and eyes; so that he cried
out with a loud voice, What have
I to do with thee, Jesus, thou son
of Mary? Whither shall I flee
from thee?

19 So he drew back much
affrighted, and left the girl.

20 And she was delivered from
this trouble, and sang praises and
thanks to God, and with her all
who were present at the working
of the miracle.


CHAPTER XIV.

     1 Judas when a boy possessed by Satan, and brought up
     by his parents to Jesus to be cured, whom he tries to bite,
     7 but failing, strikes Jesus and makes him cry out.
     Whereupon Satan goes from Jesus in the shape of a dog.

ANOTHER woman likewise
lived there, whose son was
possessed by Satan,

2  This boy, named Judas, as
often as Satan seized him, was
inclined to bite all that were
present; and if he found no one else
near him, he would bite his own
hands and other parts.

3  But the mother of this miserable
boy, hearing of St. Mary and her son
Jesus, arose presently and taking
her son in her arms, brought him
to the Lady Mary.

4  In the meantime, James and
Joses had taken away the infant,
the Lord Jesus, to play at a proper
season with other children;
and when they went forth, they
sat down and the Lord Jesus with
them.

5  Then Judas, who was possessed,
came and sat down at the right hand
of Jesus.

6  When Satan was acting upon him
as usual, he went about to bite
the Lord Jesus.

7  And because he could not do
it, he struck Jesus on the right
side, so that he cried out.

8  And in the same moment Satan
went out of the boy, and ran
away like a mad dog.

9  This same boy who struck
Jesus, and out of whom Satan went
in the form of a dog, was Judas
Iscariot, who betrayed him to the
Jews.

10  And that same side, on which
Judas: struck him, the Jews
pierced with a spear.


CHAPTER XV.

     1 Jesus and other boys play together,
     and make clay figures of animals.
     4 Jesus causes them to walk,
     6 also makes clay birds, which he causes to fly,
     and eat and drink.
     7 The children's parents alarmed,
     and take Jesus for a sorcerer.
     8 He goes to a dyer's shop, and throws all the
     cloths into the furnace, and works a miracle therewith.
     15 Whereupon the Jews praise God.

AND when the Lord Jesus was
seven years of age, he was
on a certain day with other boys
his companions about the same
age;

2  Who, when they were at play,
made clay into several shapes,
namely--asses, oxen, birds, and
other figures;

3  Each boasting of his work,
and endeavouring to exceed the
rest.

4  Then the Lord Jesus said to
the boys, I will command these
figures which I have made to
walk.

5  And immediately they moved,
and when he commanded them to
return, they returned.

6  He had also made the figures
of birds and sparrows, which,
when he commanded to fly, did
fly, and when he commanded to
stand still, did stand still; and if
he gave them meat and drink, they
did eat and drink.

7  When at length the boys went
away, and related these things to
their parents, their fathers said to
them, Take heed, children, for the
future of his company, for he is a
sorcerer; shun and avoid him, and
from henceforth never play with
him.

8  On a certain day also, when
the Lord Jesus was playing with
the boys, and running about, he
passed by a dyer's shop, whose
name was Salem.

9  And there were in his shop
many pieces of cloth belonging to
the people of that city, which they
designed to dye of several colours.

10  Then the Lord Jesus going
into the dyer's shop, took all the
cloths, and threw them into the
furnace.

11  When Salem came home, and
saw the cloths spoiled, he began to
make a great noise, and to chide
the Lord Jesus, saying,

12  What hast thou done to me,
O thou son of Mary? Thou hast
injured both me and my neighbours;
they all desired their cloths
of a proper colour; but thou hast
come and spoiled them all.

13  The Lord Jesus replied, I
will change the colour of every
cloth to what colour thou desirest.

14  And then he presently began
to take the cloths out of the furnace,
and they were all dyed of those same
colours which the dyer desired.

15  And when the Jews saw this
surprising miracle, they praised
God.


CHAP. XVI.

     1 Christ miraculously widens or contracts the gates,
     milk pails, sieves, or boxes, not properly made by Joseph,
     4 he not being skilful at his carpenter's trade.
     5 The King of Jerusalem gives Joseph an order for a throne.
     6 Joseph works on it for two years in the king's palace,
     and makes it two spans too short. The king being angry with him,
     10 Jesus comforts him,
     13 commands him to pull one side of the throne, while he
     pulls the other, and brings it to its proper dimensions.
     14 Whereupon the bystanders praise God.

AND Joseph, wheresoever he
went in the city, took the
Lord Jesus with him, where he
was sent for to work to make
gates, or milk-pails, or sieves, or
boxes; the Lord Jesus was with
him, wheresoever he went.

2  And as often as Joseph had
anything in his work, to make
longer, or shorter, or wider, or
narrower, the Lord Jesus would
stretch his hand towards it.

3  And presently it became as
Joseph would have it:

4  So that he had no need to
finish anything with his own hands,
for he was not very skilful at his
carpenter's trade.

5  On a certain time the King
of Jerusalem sent for him, and
said, I would have thee make me
a throne of the same dimensions
with that place in which I
commonly sit.

6  Joseph obeyed, and forthwith
began the work, and continued two
years in the king's palace before
he finished it.

7  And when he came to fix it
in its place, he found it wanted
two spans on each side of the
appointed measure.

8  Which when the king saw,
he was very angry with Joseph;

9  And Joseph afraid of the
king's anger, went to bed without
his supper, taking not any thing
to eat.

10  Then the Lord Jesus asked
him, What he was afraid of?

11  Joseph replied, Because I
have lost my labour in the work
which I have been about these two
years.

12  Jesus said to him, Fear not,
neither be cast down;

13  Do thou lay hold on one side
of the throne, and I will the other,
and we will bring it to its just
dimensions.

14  And when Joseph had done
as the Lord Jesus said, and each
of them had with strength drawn
his side, the throne obeyed, and
was brought to the proper
dimensions of the place:

15 Which miracle when they
who stood by saw, they were
astonished, and praised God.

16 The throne was made of the
same wood which was in being
in Solomon's time, namely, wood
adorned with various shapes, and
figures.


CHAP. XVII.

     1 Jesus plays with boys at hide and seek.
     3 Some women put his playfellows in a furnace,
     7 where they are transformed by Jesus into kids.
     10 Jesus calls them to go and play, and they
     are restored to their former shape.

ON another day the Lord Jesus
going out into the street,
and seeing some boys who were
met to play, joined himself to their
company.

2 But when they saw him, they
hid themselves, and left him to
seek for them;

3 The Lord Jesus came to the
gate of a certain house, and asked
some women who were standing
there, Where the boys were gone?

4 And when they answered,
That there was no one there; the
Lord Jesus said, Who are those
whom ye see in the furnace?

5 They answered, They were
kids of three years old.

6 Then Jesus cried out aloud,
and said, Come out hither, O ye
kids, to your shepherd;

7 And presently the boys came
forth like kids, and leaped about
him; which when the women saw,
they were exceedingly amazed, and
trembled,

8 Then they immediately worshipped,
the Lord Jesus, and beseeched him,
saying, O our Lord Jesus, son of
Mary, thou art truly that good
shepherd of Israel! have mercy
on thy handmaids, who stand before
thee, who do not doubt, but that
thou, O Lord, art come to save,
and not to destroy.

9  After that, when the Lord
Jesus said, the children of Israel
are like Ethiopians among the
people; the women said, Thou,
Lord, knowest all things, nor is
any thing concealed from thee:
but now we entreat thee, and
beseech of thy mercy, that thou
wouldest restore those boys to
their former state.

10 Then Jesus said, Come hither,
O boys, that we may go and
play; and immediately, in the
presence of these women, the kids
were changed, and returned into
the shape of boys.


CHAPTER XVIII.

     1 Jesus becomes the king of his playfellows,
     and they crown him with flowers;
     4 miraculously causes a serpent who had
     bitten Simon the Canaanite, then a boy,
     to suck out all the poison again;
     16 the serpent bursts, and Christ restores the boy to health.


IN the month Adar Jesus
gathered together the boys, and
ranked them as though he had
been a king.

2  For they spread their garments
on the ground for him to sit
on; and having made a crown of
flowers, put it upon his head, and
stood on his right and left as the
guards of a king.

3  And if any one happened to
pass by, they took him by force,
and said, Come hither, and worship
the king, that you may have a
prosperous journey.

4  In the mean time, while
these things were doing, there
came certain men, carrying a boy
upon a couch;

5  For this boy having gone with
his companions to the mountain to
gather wood, and having found
there a partridge's nest, and put
his hand in to take out the eggs,
was stung by a poisonous serpent,
which leaped out of the nest; so
that he was forced to cry out for
the help of his companions; who,
when they came, found him lying
upon the earth like a dead person.

6  After which his neighbours
came and carried him back into
the city.

7  But when they came to the
place where the Lord Jesus, was
sitting like a king, and the other
boys stood around him like his
ministers, the boys made haste to
meet him, who was bitten by the
serpent, and said to his neighbours,
Come and pay your respects to the
king;

8  But when, by reason of their
sorrow, they refused to come, the
boys drew them, and forced them
against their wills to come.

9  And when they came to the
Lord Jesus, he inquired, On what
account they carried that boy?

10  And when they answered that
a serpent had bitten him, the Lord
Jesus said to the boys, Let us go
and kill that serpent.

11  But when the parents of the
boy desired to be excused, because
their son lay at the point of death;
the boys made answer, and said,
Did not ye hear what the king
said? Let us go and kill the serpent;
and will not ye obey him?

12  So they brought the couch
back again, whether they would
or not.

13  And when they were come to
the nest, the Lord Jesus said to
the boys, Is this the serpent's
lurking place? They said, It was.

14  Then the Lord Jesus calling
the serpent, it presently came forth
and submitted to him; to whom he
said, Go and suck out all the poison
which thou hast infused into that
boy:

15  So the serpent crept to the
boy, and took away all its poison
again.

16  Then the Lord Jesus cursed
the serpent, so that it immediately
burst asunder, and died;

17  And he touched the boy with
his hand to restore him to his
former health;

18  And when he began to cry,
the Lord Jesus said, Cease crying
for hereafter thou shall be my
disciple;

19 And this is that Simon the
Canaanite, who is mentioned in
the Gospel.


CHAPTER XIX.

     1 James being bitten by a viper,
     Jesus blows on the wound and cures him.
     4 Jesus charged with throwing a boy from
     the roof of a house,
     10 miraculously raises the dead boy to acquit him;
     12 fetches water for his mother, breaks the pitcher
     and miraculously gathers the water in his mantle
     and brings it home;
     16 makes fish pools on the Sabbath,
     20 causes a boy to die who broke them down,
     22 another boy runs against him,
     whom he also causes to die.

ON another day Joseph sent his
son James to gather wood,
and the Lord Jesus went with
him;

2  And when they came to the
place where the wood was, and
James began to gather it, behold,
a venomous viper bit him, so that
he began to cry, and make a
noise.

3  The Lord Jesus seeing him in
this condition, came to him, and
blowed upon the place where the
viper had bit him, and it was
instantly well.

4  On a certain day the Lord
Jesus was with some boys, who
were playing on the house-top,
and one of the boys fell down, and
presently died.

5  Upon which the other boys all
running away, the Lord Jesus was
left alone on the house-top.

6  And the boy's relations came
to him and said to the Lord Jesus,
Thou didst throw our son down
from the house-top.

7  But he denying it, they cried
out, Our son is dead, and this is
he who killed him.

8  The Lord Jesus replied to
them, Do not charge me with a
crime of which you are not able to
convict me, but let us go and ask
the boy himself, who will bring
the truth to light.

9  Then the Lord Jesus going
down stood over the head of the
dead boy, and said with a loud
voice, Zeinunus, Zeinunus, who
threw thee down from the housetop?

10  Then the dead boy answered,
thou didst not throw me down,
but such a one did.

11  And when the Lord Jesus
bade those who stood by to take
present praised God on account
of that miracle.

12  On a certain time the
Lady St. Mary had commanded
the Lord Jesus to fetch her some
water out of the well;

13  And when he had gone to
fetch the water, the pitcher, when
it was brought up full, brake;

14  But Jesus spreading his mantle
gathered up the water again,
and brought it in that to his
mother;

15  Who, being astonished at
this wonderful thing, laid up this,
and all the other things which she
had seen, in her memory.

16  Again on another day the
Lord Jesus was with some boys
by a river, and they drew water
out of the river by little channels,
and made little fish-pools.

17  But the Lord Jesus had
made twelve sparrows, and placed
them about his pool on each side,
three on a side.

18  But it was the Sabbath day,
and the son of Hanani a Jew came
by, and saw them making these
things, and said, Do ye thus make
figures of clay on the Sabbath?
And he ran to them, and broke
down their fish-pools.

19  But when the Lord Jesus
clapped his hands over the sparrows
which he had made, they fled away
chirping.

20  At length the son of Hanani
coming to the fish-pool of Jesus
to destroy it, the water vanished
away, and the Lord Jesus said to
him,

21  In like manner as this water
had vanished, so shall thy life
vanish; and presently the boy
died.

22  Another time, when the
Lord Jesus was coming home in
the evening with Joseph, he met
a boy, who ran so hard against
him, that he threw him down;

23  To whom the Lord Jesus
said, As thou hast thrown me
down, so shalt thou fall, nor ever
rise.

24 And that moment the boy
fell down and died.


CHAPTER XX.

     4 Christ sent to school to Zaccheus to learn
     his letters, and teaches Zaccheus.
     13 Sent to another schoolmaster,
     14 refuses to tell his letters, and the schoolmaster
     going to whip him, his hand withers and he dies.

THERE was also at Jerusalem
one named Zaccheus, who
was a schoolmaster:

2  And he said to Joseph, Joseph,
why dost thou not send Jesus to me,
that he may learn his letters?

3  Joseph agreed, and told St. Mary;

4  So they brought him to that
master; who, as soon as he saw
him, wrote out an alphabet for him,

5  And he bade him say Aleph;
and when he had said Aleph, the
master bade him pronounce Beth.

6  Then the Lord Jesus said to
him, Tell me first the meaning of
the letter Aleph, and then I will
pronounce Beth.

7  And when the master threatened
to whip him, the Lord Jesus
explained to him the meaning of
the letters Aleph and Beth;

8  Also which were the straight
figures of the letters, which the
oblique, and what letters had
double figures; which had points,
and which had none; why one
letter went before another; and
many other things he began to tell
him, and explain, of which the
master himself had never heard,
nor read in any book.

9  The Lord Jesus farther said
to the master, Take notice how I
say to thee; then he began clearly
and distinctly to say Aleph, Beth,
Gimel, Daleth, and so on to the
end of the alphabet.

10  At this the master was so
surprised, that he said, I believe
this boy was born before Noah;

11  And turning to Joseph, he
said, Thou hast brought a boy to
me to be taught, who is more
learned than any master.

12  He said also to St. Mary,
This your son has no need of any
learning.

13  They brought him then
to a more learned master, who,
when he saw him, said, say Aleph;

14  And when he had said Aleph,
the master bade him pronounce
Beth; to which the Lord Jesus
replied, Tell me first the meaning
of the letter Aleph, and then I
will pronounce Beth.

15  But this master, when he did
lift up his hand to whip him, had
his hand presently withered, and
he died.

16 Then said Joseph to St. Mary,
Henceforth we will not allow him
to go out of the house; for every
one who displeases him is killed.


CHAPTER XXI.

     [Compare Luke ii. 42, whose meagre account is deficient
     of the sublime details here given of the subjects disputed upon.]

     1 Disputes learnedly with the doctors in the temple,
     7 on law,
     9 on astronomy,
     12 on physics and metaphysics.
     21 Is worshipped by a philosopher,
     28 and fetched home by his mother.

AND when he was twelve years
old, they brought him to
Jerusalem to the feast; and when
the feast was over, they returned.

2  But the Lord Jesus continued
behind in the temple among the
doctors and elders, and learned
men of Israel; to whom he proposed
several questions of learning,
and also gave them answers:

3  For he said to them, Whose
son is the Messiah?  They answered,
the son of David.

4  Why then, said he, does he in
the spirit call him Lord? When he
saith, The Lord said to my Lord,
sit thou at my right hand, till I
have made thine enemies thy foot-
stool.

5  Then a certain principal Rabbi
asked him, Hast thou read books?

6  Jesus answered, he had read
both books, and the things which
were contained in books.

7  And he explained to them the
books of the law, and precepts,
and statutes: and the mysteries
which are contained in the books
of the prophets; things which
the mind of no creature could
reach.

8  Then said that Rabbi, I never
yet have seen or heard of such
knowledge! What do you think
that boy will be?

9  When a certain astronomer,
who was present, asked the Lord
Jesus, Whether he had studied
astronomy?

10  The Lord Jesus replied, and
told him the number of the spheres
and heavenly bodies, as also their
triangular, square, and sextile
aspect; their progressive and
retrograde motion; their size and
several prognostications; and other
things which the reason of man
had never discovered.

11  There was also among them
a philosopher well skilled in
physic and natural philosophy,
who asked the Lord Jesus, Whether
he had studied physic?

12  He replied, and explained to
him physics and metaphysics.

13  Also those things which were
above and below the power of nature;

14  The powers also of the body,
its humours, and their effects.

15  Also the number of its members,
and bones, veins, arteries,
and nerves;

16  The several constitutions of
body, hot and dry, cold and moist,
and the tendencies of them;

17  How the soul operated upon
the body;

18  What its various sensations
and faculties, were;

19  The faculty of speaking, anger,
desire;

20  And lastly the manner of its
composition and dissolution; and
other things, which the
understanding of no creature
had ever reached.

21  Then that philosopher arose,
and worshipped the Lord Jesus,
and said, O Lord Jesus, from
henceforth I will be thy disciple
and servant.

22  While they were discoursing
on these and such like things,
the Lady St. Mary came in, having
been three days walking about
with Joseph, seeking for him.

23  And when she saw him sitting
among the doctors, and in his turn
proposing questions to them, and
giving answers, she said to him,
My son, why hast thou done thus
by us? Behold I and thy father
have been at much pains in
seeking thee.

24  He replied, Why did ye seek
me? Did ye not know that I ought
to be employed in my father's
house?

25  But they understood not the
words which he said to them.

26  Then the doctors asked Mary,
Whether this were her son? And
when she said, He was, they said,
O happy Mary, who hast borne
such a son.

27  Then he returned with them
to Nazareth, and obeyed them in
all things.

28  And his mother kept all these
things in her mind;

29  And the Lord Jesus grew in
stature and wisdom, and favour
with God and man.


CHAPTER XXII.

     1 Jesus conceals his miracles,
     2 studies the law,
     3 and is baptized.

NOW from this time Jesus began
to conceal his miracles and
secret works,

2  And gave himself to the study
of the law, till he arrived to the
end of his thirtieth year;

3  At which time the Father publicly
owned him at Jordan, sending
down this voice from heaven, This
is my beloved son, in whom I am
well pleased;

4  The Holy Ghost being also
present in the form of a dove.

5  This is he whom we worship
with all reverence, because he gave
us our life and being, and brought
us from our mother's womb,
Glory to God,

6  Who, for our sakes, took a
human body, and hath redeemed
us, that so he might embrace
us with everlasting mercy, and
shew his free, large, bountiful
grace and goodness to us.

7  To him be glory and praise,
and power, and dominion, from
henceforth said for evermore.
Amen.

the Infancy, by the assistance of
the Supreme God, according to
what we found in the original.)


                   REFERENCES TO THE FIRST GOSPEL OF
                      THE INFANCY OF JESUS CHRIST

[Mr. Henry Sike, Professor of Oriental Languages at Cambridge, first
translated and published this Gospel in 1697. It was received by the
Gnostics, a sect of Christians in the second century; and several of its
relations were credited in the following ages by other Christians, viz.,
Eusebius, Athanasius, Epiphanius; Chrysostom. &c. Sozomen says, he was
told by many, and he credits the relations, of the idols in Egypt falling
down on Joseph, and Mary's flight thither with Christ; and of Christ
making a well to wash his clothes in a sycamore-tree, from whence balsam
afterwards proceeded; which stories are from this Gospel. Chemnitius, out
of Stipulensis, who had it from Peter Martyr, Bishop of Alexandria, in
the third century, says, that the place in Egypt where Christ was
banished is now called Matarea, about ten miles beyond Cairo; that the
inhabitants constantly burn a lamp in remembrance of it; and that there
is a garden of trees yielding a balsam, which were planted by Christ when
a boy.  M. La Crosse cites a synod at Angamala, in the Mountain of
Malabar, A. D.  1599, which shows this Gospel was commonly read by the
Nestorians in the country. Ahmed Ibu Idris, a Mahometan divine, says, it
was used by some Christians in common with the other four Gospels; and
Ocobius de Castro mentions a Gospel of Thomas, which he says, he saw and
had translated to him by an Armenian Archbishop at Amsterdam, that was
read in very many churches of Asia and Africa, as the only rule of their
faith. Fabricius takes it to be this Gospel. It has been supposed, that
Mahomet and his coadjutors used it in compiling the Koran. There are
several stories believed of Christ, proceeding from this Gospel; as that
which Mr. Sike relates out of La Brosse's Persic Lexicon, that Christ
practised the trade of a dyer, and his working a miracle with the
colours; from whence the Persian dyers honour him as their patron, and
call a dye-house the shop of Christ. Sir John Chardin mentions Persian
legends concerning Christ's dispute with his schoolmaster about his ABC;
and his lengthening the cedar-board which Joseph sawed too short.]


        Note on the Miracles of Christ in the preceding Gospels.

A great void in the early life of the Saviour is filled up by these
Gospels. In none of the Canonical Evangelists is any mention made of the
childhood of Jesus.  The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, more
rapidly than satisfactorily, pass over the period intervening between His
birth and ministry. It is natural to suppose that the Infant Redeemer's
earliest days were spent in the society of other young children, and it
is quite consistent with every sincere Christians faith to believe that
He had the power to perform the miracles here ascribed to him otherwise,
a limit will be set to His divine attributes, doubts raised against His
performance of the miracles related by the four Evangelists, in the
authorised version of the Testament, and a denial given of the
declaration therein, "With GOD nothing is impossible!"


                 THE SECOND, OR ST. THOMAS'S GOSPEL OF
                      THE INFANCY OF JESUS CHRIST.

    An Account of the ACTIONS and MIRACLES of our Lord and Saviour
                      JESUS CHRIST in his INFANCY.


CHAPTER I.

     2 Jesus miraculously clears the water after rain.
     4 Plays with clay sparrows, which he animates
     on the Sabbath day.

I THOMAS, an Israelite, judged
it necessary to make known to
our brethren among the Gentiles,
the actions and miracles of Christ
in his childhood, which our Lord
and God Jesus Christ wrought
after his birth in Bethlehem in our
country, at which I myself, was
astonished; the beginning of which
was as followeth.

2  When the child Jesus was
five years of age, and there had
been a shower of rain, which was
now over, Jesus was playing with
other Hebrew boys by a running
stream; and the water running
over the banks, stood in little
lakes;

3  But the water instantly became
clear and useful again; he
having smote them only by his
word, they readily obeyed him.

4  Then he took from the bank
of the stream some soft clay, and
formed out of it twelve sparrows;
and there were other boys playing
with him.

5  But a certain Jew seeing the
things which he was doing, namely,
his forming clay into the figures
of sparrows on the Sabbath day,
went presently away, and told
his father Joseph, and said,

6  Behold, thy boy is playing by
the river side, and has taken clay,
and formed it into twelve sparrows,
and profaneth the Sabbath.

7  Then Joseph came to the
place where he was, and when he
saw him, called to him, and said,
Why doest thou that which it is
not lawful to do on the Sabbath
day?

8  Then Jesus clapping together
the palms of his hands, called to
the sparrows, and said to them
Go, fly away; and while ye live
remember me.

9  So the sparrows fled away
making a noise.

10  The Jews seeing this, were
astonished, and went away, and
told their chief persons what a
strange miracle they had seen
wrought by Jesus.


CHAPTER II.

     2 Causes a boy to wither who broke down his fish-pools;
     6 Partly restores him.
     7 Kills another boy.
     16 causes blindness to fall on his accusers,
     18 for which, Joseph pulls him by the ear.

BESIDES this, the son of Annas
the scribe, was standing there
with Joseph, and took a bough
of a willow tree, and scattered
the waters which Jesus had
gathered into lakes.

2  But the boy Jesus seeing what
he had done, became angry, and
said to him, Thou fool, what harm
did the lake do thee, that thou
shouldest scatter the water?

3  Behold, now thou shalt wither
as a tree, and shalt not bring forth
either leaves, or branches, or fruit.

4  And immediately he became
withered all over.

5  Then Jesus went away home.
But the parents of the boy who
was withered, lamenting the
misfortune of his youth, took and
carried him to Joseph, accusing him,
and said, Why dost thou keep a
son who is guilty of such actions?

6  Then Jesus at the request of
all who were present did heal him,
leaving only some small member
to continue withered, that they
might take warning.

7  Another time Jesus went
forth into the street, and a boy
running by, rushed upon his
shoulder;

8  At which Jesus being angry,
said to him, Thou shalt go no
farther;

9  And he instantly fell down
dead:

10  Which when some persons
saw, they said, Where was this
boy born, that every thing which
he says presently cometh to pass?

11  Then the parents of the dead
boy going to Joseph, complained,
saying, You are not fit to live with
us, in our city, having such a boy
as that:

12  Either teach him that he
bless and not curse, or else depart
hence with him, for he kills our
children.

13  Then Joseph calling the
boy Jesus by himself, instructed
him, saying, Why doest thou such
things to injure the people so, that
they hate us and prosecute us?

14  But Jesus replied, I know
that what thou sayest is not of
thyself, but for thy sake I will
say nothing;

15  But they who have said these
things to thee, shall suffer
everlasting punishment.

16  And immediately they who
had accused him became blind,

17  And all they who saw it were
exceedingly afraid and confounded,
and said concerning him, Whatsoever
he saith, whether good or bad,
immediately cometh to pass and
they were amazed.

18  And when they saw this action
of Christ, Joseph arose, and
plucked him by the ear, at which
the boy was angry, and said to
him, Be easy;

19  For if they seek for us, they
shall not find us: thou hast done
very imprudently.

20  Dost thou not know that I
am thine? Trouble me no more.


CHAPTER III.

     1 Astonishes his schoolmaster by his learning.

A CERTAIN schoolmaster
named Zaccheaus, standing
in a certain place, heard Jesus
speaking these things to his father.

2  And he was much surprised,
that being a child he should speak
such things; and after a few days
he came to Joseph, and said,

3  Thou hast a wise and sensible
child, send him to me, that he may
learn to read.

4  When he sat down to teach
the letters to Jesus, he began with
the first letter Aleph;

5  But Jesus pronounced the
second letter Mpeth (Beth) Cghimel
(Gimel), and said over all the
letters to him to the end.

6  Then opening a book, he
taught his master the prophets
but he was ashamed, and was at a
loss to conceive how he came to
know the letters.

7  And he arose and went home,
wonderfully surprised at so strange
a thing.


CHAPTER IV.

     1 Fragment of an adventure at a dyer's.

AS Jesus was passing by a certain
shop, he saw a young man dipping
(or dyeing) some cloths and stockings
in a furnace, of a sad colour, doing
them according to every person's
particular order;

2  The boy Jesus going to the
young man who was doing this,
took also some of the cloths ......

                        THE GOSPEL OF NICODEMUS,
              FORMERLY CALLED THE ACTS OF PONTIUS PILATE.


The Gospel of NICODEMUS, the disciple,
concerning the Sufferings and Resurrection
of our Master and Saviour, JESUS CHRIST.


CHAPTER I.

     1 Christ accused to Pilate by the Jews
     of healing on the Sabbath.
     9 Summoned before Pilate by a messenger
     who does him honour.
     20 Worshipped by the standards bowing down to him.

ANNAS and Caiphas, and
Summas, and Datam, Gamaliel,
Judas, Levi, Nepthalim, Alexander,
Cyrus, and other Jews, went
to Pilate about Jesus, accusing
him with many bad crimes.

2  And said, We are assured that
Jesus is the son of Joseph, the
carpenter, and born of Mary, and
that he declares himself the Son of
God, and a king; and not only so,
but attempts the dissolution of the
Sabbath, and the laws of our
fathers.

3  Pilate replied, What is it
which he declares? and what is it
which he attempts dissolving?

4  The Jews told him, We have
a law which forbids doing cures
on the Sabbath day; but he cures
both the lame and the deaf, those
afflicted with the palsy, the blind,
the lepers, and demoniacs, on that
day, by wicked methods.

5  Pilate replied, How can he
do this by wicked methods? They
answered He is a conjurer, and
casts out devils by the prince of
the devils; and so all things,
become subject to him.

6  Then said Pilate, Casting out
devils seems not to be the work of
an unclean spirit, but to proceed
from the power of God.

7  The Jews replied to Pilate,
We entreat your highness to summon
him to appear before your tribunal,
and hear him yourself.

8  Then Pilate called a messenger,
and said to him, By what means
will Christ be brought hither?

9  Then went the messenger
forth, and knowing Christ,
worshipped him; and having spread
the cloak which he had in his hand
upon the ground, he said, Lord,
walk upon this, and go in, for the
governor calls thee.

10  When the Jews perceived
what the messenger had done,
they exclaimed (against him) to
Pilate, and said, Why did you not
give him his summons by a beadle,
and not by a messenger?--For the
messenger, when he saw him,
worshipped him, and spread the
cloak which he had in his hand
upon the ground before him, and
said to him, Lord, the governor
calls thee.

11  Then Pilate called the
messenger, and said, Why hast thou
done thus?

12  The messenger replied, When
thou sentest me from Jerusalem to
Alexander, I saw Jesus sitting in
a mean figure upon a she-ass, and
the children of the Hebrews cried
out, Hosannah, holding boughs of
trees in their hands.

13  Others spread their garments
in the way, and said, Save us, thou
who art in heaven; blessed is he
who cometh in the name of the
Lord.

14  Then the Jews cried out,
against the messenger, and said,
The children of the Hebrews made
their acclamations in the Hebrew
language; and how couldst thou,
who art a Greek, understand the
Hebrew?

15  The messenger answered
them and said, I asked one of the
Jews and said, What is this which
the children do cry out in the
Hebrew language?

16  And he explained it to me,
saying, they cry out, Hosannah,
which being interpreted, is, O
Lord, save me; or, O Lord, save.

17  Pilate then said to them,
Why do you yourselves testify to
the words spoken by the children,
namely, by your silence?  In what
has the messenger done amiss?
And they were silent.

18  Then the governor said unto
the messenger, Go forth and
endeavour by any means to bring
him in.

19  But the messenger went forth
and did as before; and said, Lord
come in, for the governor calleth
thee.

20  And as Jesus was going in
by the ensigns, who carried the
standards, the tops of them bowed
down and worshipped Jesus.

21  Whereupon the Jews exclaimed
more vehemently against the ensigns.

22  But Pilate said to the Jews,
I know it is not pleasing to you
that the tops of the standards did
of themselves bow and worship
Jesus; but why do ye exclaim
against the ensigns, as if they had
bowed and worshipped?

23  They replied to Pilate,
We saw the ensigns themselves
bowing and worshipping Jesus.

24  Then the governor called the
ensigns, and said unto them, Why
did you do thus?

25  The ensigns said to Pilate,
We are all Pagans and worship
the gods in temples; and how
should we think anything about
worshipping him?  We only held
the standards in our hands,
and they bowed themselves and
worshipped him.

26  Then said Pilate to the rulers
of the synagogue, Do ye yourselves
choose some strong men, and let
them hold the standards, and we
shall see whether they will then
bend of themselves.

27  So the elders of the Jews
sought out twelve of the most
strong and able old men, and made
them hold the standards, and they
stood in the presence of the governor.

28  Then Pilate said to the
messenger, Take Jesus out, and by
some means bring him in again.
And Jesus and the messenger went
out of the hall.

29  And Pilate called the ensigns
who before had borne the standards,
and swore to them, that if they
had not borne the standards in
that manner when Jesus before
entered in, he would cut off
their heads.

30  Then the governor commanded
Jesus to come in again.

31  And the messenger did as he
had done before, and very much
entreated Jesus that he would go
upon his cloak, and walk on it;
and he did walk upon it, and went
in.

32  And when Jesus went in,
the standards bowed themselves as
before, and worshipped him.


CHAPTER II.

     2 Is compassionated by Pilate's wife,
     7 charged with being born in fornication.
     12 Testimony to the betrothing of his parents.
     15 Hatred of the Jews to him.

NOW when Pilate saw this, he
was afraid, and was about to
rise from his seat.

2  But while he thought to rise,
his own wife who stood at a
distance, sent to him, saying, Have
thou nothing to do with that just
man; for I have suffered much
concerning him in a vision this
night.

3  When the Jews heard this
they said to Pilate, Did we not say
unto thee, He is a conjuror? Behold,
he hath caused thy wife to dream.

4  Pilate then calling Jesus, said,
thou hast heard what they testify
against thee, and makest no answer?

5  Jesus replied, If they had not
a power of speaking, they could
not have spoke; but because every
one has the command of his own
tongue, to speak both good and
bad, let him look to it.

6  But the elders of the Jews
answered, and said to Jesus, What
shall we look to?

7  In the first place, we know
this concerning thee, that thou
wast born through fornication;
secondly, that upon the account of
thy birth the infants were slain in
Bethlehem; thirdly, that thy father
and mother Mary fled into Egypt,
because they could not trust their
own people.

8  Some of the Jews who stood
by spake more favourably, We
cannot say that he was born
through fornication; but we know
that his mother Mary was betrothed
to Joseph, and so he was not born
through fornication.

9  Then said Pilate to the Jews
who affirmed him to be born
through fornication, This your
account is not true, seeing there was
a betrothment, as they testify who
are of your own nation.

10  Annas and Caiphas spake to
Pilate, All this multitude of people
is to be regarded, who cry out,
that he was born through fornication,
and is a conjurer; but they who deny
him to be born through fornication,
are his proselytes and disciples.

11  Pilate answered Annas and
Caiphas, Who are the proselytes?
They answered, They are those
who are the children of Pagans,
and are not become Jews, but
followers of him.

12  Then replied Eleazer, and
Asterius, and Antonius, and James,
Caras and Samuel, Isaac and Phinees,
Crispus and Agrippa, Annas and Judas,
We are not proselytes, but children
of Jews, and speak the truth,
and were present when Mary was
betrothed.

13  Then Pilate addressing
himself to the twelve men who
spake this, said to them, I conjure
you by the life of Caesar, that ye
faithfully declare whether he was
born through fornication, and those
things be true which ye have related.

14  They answered Pilate, We
have a law whereby we are forbid
to swear, it being a sin: Let them
swear by the life of Caesar that it
is not as we have said, and we will
be contented to be put to death.

15  Then said Annas and Caiphas
to Pilate, Those twelve men will
not believe that we know him to be
basely born, and to be a conjurer,
although he pretends that he is
the Son of God, and a king: which
we are so far from believing, that
we tremble to hear.

16  Then Pilate commanded
every one to go out except the
twelve men who said he was not
born through fornication, and
Jesus to withdraw to a distance,
and said to them, Why have the Jews
a mind to kill Jesus?

17  They answered him, They
are angry because he wrought
cures on the sabbath day. Pilate
said, Will they kill him for a
good work? They say unto him,
Yes, Sir.


CHAPTER III.

1 Is exonerated by Pilate.
11 Disputes with Pilate concerning truth.

THEN Pilate, filled with anger,
went out of the hall, and said
to the Jews, I call the whole
world to witness that I find no
fault in that man.

2  The Jews replied to Pilate,
If he had not been a wicked person,
we had not brought him before thee.

3  Pilate said to them, Do ye take
him and try him by your law.

4  Then the Jews said, It is not
lawful for us to put any one to
death.

5  Pilate said to the Jews, The
command, therefore, thou shalt
not kill, belongs to you, but
not to me.

6  And he went again into the
hall, and called Jesus by himself,
and said to him, Art thou the king
of the Jews?

7  And Jesus answering, said
to Pilate, Dost thou speak this
of thyself, or did the Jews tell
it thee concerning me?

8  Pilate answering, said to
Jesus, Am I a Jew? The whole
nation and rulers of the Jews have
delivered thee up to me. What
hast thou done?

9  Jesus answering, said, My
kingdom is not of this world:
if my kingdom were of this world,
then would my servants fight,
and I should not have been
delivered to the Jews: but now
my kingdom is not from hence.

10  Pilate said, Art thou a king
then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest
that I am a king: to this end
was I born, and for this end came
I into the world; and for this
purpose I came, that I should bear
witness to the truth; and every
one who is of the truth, heareth
my voice.

11  Pilate saith to him, What is
truth?

12  Jesus said, Truth is from
heaven.

13  Pilate said, Therefore truth
is not on earth.

14  Jesus saith to Pilate,
Believe that truth is on earth
among those, who when they have
the power of judgment, are governed
by truth, and form right judgment.


CHAPTER IV.

     1 Pilate finds no fault in Jesus.
     16 The Jews demand his crucifixion.

THEN Pilate left Jesus in the hall,
and went out to the Jews, and said,
I find not any one fault in Jesus.

2  The Jews say unto him, But
he said, I can destroy the temple
of God, and in three days build it
up again.

3  Pilate saith to them, What
sort of temple is that of which he
speaketh?

4  The Jews say unto him,
That which Solomon was forty-six
years in building, he said he
would destroy, and in three days
build up.

5  Pilate said to them again, I
am innocent from the blood of that
man! do ye look to it.

6  The Jews say to him, His
blood be upon us and our children.
Then Pilate calling together the
elders and scribes, priests and
Levites, saith to them privately,
Do not act thus; I have found
nothing in your charge (against
him) concerning his curing sick
persons, and breaking the sabbath,
worthy of death.

7  The priests and Levites replied
to Pilate, By the life of Caesar,
if any one be a blasphemer, he is
worthy of death; but this man hath
blasphemed against the Lord.

8  Then the governor again
commanded the Jews to depart out
of the hall; and calling Jesus,
said to him, What shall I do with
thee?

9  Jesus answered him, Do according
as it is written.

10  Pilate said to him, How is it
written?

11  Jesus saith to him, Moses
and the prophets have prophesied
concerning my suffering and
resurrection.

12  The Jews hearing this, were
provoked, and said to Pilate,
Why wilt thou any longer hear the
blasphemy of that man?

13  Pilate saith to them, If these
words seem to you blasphemy, do
ye take him, bring him to your
court, and try him according to
your law.

14  The Jews reply to Pilate,
Our law saith, he shall be obliged
to receive nine and thirty stripes,
but if after this manner he shall
blaspheme against the Lord, he
shall be stoned.

15  Pilate saith unto them, If
that speech of his was blasphemy,
do ye try him according to your
law.

16  The Jews say to Pilate, Our
law command us not to put any one
to death. We desire that he may be
crucified, because he deserves the
death of the cross.

17  Pilate saith to them, It is not
fit he should be crucified: let him
be only whipped and sent away.

18  But when the governor looked
upon the people that were present
and the Jews, he saw many of the
Jews in tears, and said to the
chief priests of the Jews, All
the people do not desire his death.

19  The elders of the Jews answered
to Pilate, We and all the people
came hither for this very purpose,
that he should die.

20  Pilate saith to them, Why should
he die?

21  They said to him, Because
he declares himself to be the Son
of God and a King.


CHAP. V.

     1 Nicodemus speaks in defence of Christ,
     and relates his miracles.
     12 Another Jew,
     26 with Veronica,
     34 Centurio, and others,
     testify of other miracles.

BUT Nicodemus, a certain Jew,
stood before the governor,
and said, I entreat thee,
O righteous judge, that thou
wouldst favour me with the
liberty of speaking a few words.

2  Pilate said to him, Speak on.

3  Nicodemus said, I spake to
the elders of the Jews, and the
scribes, and priests and Levites,
and all the multitude of the Jews,
in their assembly; What is it ye
would do with this man?

4  He is a man who hath wrought
many useful and glorious miracles,
such as no man on earth ever
wrought before, nor will ever
work.  Let him go, and do him
no harm; if he cometh from God,
his miracles, (his miraculous
cures) will continue; but if from
men, they will come to nought.

5  Thus Moses, when he was
sent by God into Egypt, wrought
the miracles which God commanded
him, before Pharaoh king of Egypt;
and though the magicians of that
country, Jannes and Jambres,
wrought by their magic the same
miracles which Moses did, yet they
could not work all which he did;

6  And the miracles which the
magicians wrought, were not of
God, as ye know, O Scribes and
Pharisees; but they who wrought
them perished, and all who
believed them.

7  And now let this man go;
because the very miracles for
which ye accuse him, are from
God; and he is not worthy of
death.

8  The Jews then said to Nicodemus,
Art thou become his disciple,
and making speeches in his favour?

9  Nicodemus said to them, Is
the governor become his disciple
also, and does he make speeches
for him? Did not Caesar place
him in that high post?

10  When the Jews heard this
they trembled, and gnashed their
teeth at Nicodemus, and said to
him, Mayest thou receive his
doctrine for truth, and have
thy lot with Christ!

11  Nicodemus replied, Amen;
I will receive his doctrine, and
my lot with him, as ye have said.

12  Then another certain Jew
rose up, and desired leave of the
governor to hear him a few words.

13  And the governor said,
Speak, what thou hast a mind.

14  And he said, I lay for thirty-
eight years by the sheep-pool at
Jerusalem, labouring under a great
infirmity, and waiting for a cure
which should be wrought by the
coming of an angel, who at a
certain time troubled the water: and
whosoever first after the troubling
of the water stepped in, was made
whole of whatsoever disease he had.

15  And when Jesus saw me languishing
there, he said to me, Wilt thou be
made whole? And I answered, Sir,
I have no man, when the water is
troubled, to put me into the pool.

16  And he said unto me, Rise,
take up thy bed and walk. And
I was immediately made whole,
and took up my bed and walked.

17  The Jews then said to Pilate,
Our Lord Governor, pray ask
him what day it was on which he
was cured of his infirmity.

18  The infirm person replied,
It was on the sabbath.

19  The Jews said to Pilate, Did
we not say that he wrought his
cures on the sabbath, and cast out
devils by the prince of devils?

20  Then another certain Jew
came forth, and said, I was blind,
could hear sounds, but could not
see any one; and as Jesus was
going along, I heard the multitude
passing by, and I asked what
was there?

21  They told me that Jesus was
passing by: then I cried out,
saying, Jesus, Son of David, have
mercy on me. And he stood still,
and commanded that I should be
brought to him, and said to me,
What wilt thou?

22  I said, Lord, that I may
receive my sight.

23  He said to me, Receive thy
sight: and presently I saw, and
followed him, rejoicing and giving
thanks,

24  Another Jew also came forth,
and said, I was a leper, and he
cured me by his word only, saying,
I will, be thou clean; and presently
I was cleansed from my leprosy.

25  And another Jew came
forth, and said I was crooked,
and he made me straight by his
word.

26  And a certain woman
named Veronica, said, I was
afflicted with an issue of blood
twelve years, and I touched the
hem of his garment, and presently
the issue of blood stopped.

27  The Jews then said, We
have a law, that a woman shall
not be allowed as an evidence.

28  And, after other things,
another Jew said, I saw Jesus
invited to a wedding with his
disciples, and there was a want
of wine in Cana of Galilee;

29  And when the wine was all
drank, he commanded the servants
that they should fill six pots which
were there with water, and they
filled them up to the brim, and he
blessed them and turned the water
into wine, and all the people drank,
being surprised at this miracle,

30 And another Jew stood forth,
and said, I saw Jesus teaching
in the synagogue at Capernaum;
and there was in the synagogue
a certain man who had a devil;
and he cried out, saying,
let me alone; what have we to
do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth?
Art thou come to destroy us?
I know that thou art the Holy One
of God.

31 And Jesus rebuked him, saying,
Hold thy peace, unclean spirit,
and come out of the man; and
presently he came out of him, and
did not at all hurt him.

32  The following things were
also said by a Pharisee: I saw
that a great company came to
Jesus from Galilee and Judea, and
the sea-cost, and many countries
about Jordan; and many infirm
persons came to him, and he healed
them all.

33  And I heard the unclean
spirits crying out, and saying,
Thou art the Son of God. And
Jesus strictly charged them, that
they should not make him known.

34  After this another person,
whose name was Centurio, said,
I saw Jesus in Capernaum, and I
entreated him, saying, Lord, my
servant lieth at home sick of the
palsy.

35  And Jesus said to me, I
will come and cure him.

36  But I said, Lord, I am not
worthy that thou shouldst come
under my roof; but only speak
the word, and my servant shall be
healed.

37  And Jesus said unto me, Go
thy way; and as thou hast believed
so be it done unto thee. And my
servant was healed from that same
hour.

38  Then a certain nobleman
said, I had a son in Capernaum,
who lay at the point of death; and
when I heard that Jesus was come
into Galilee, I went and besought
him that he would come down to
my house, and heal my son, for he
was at the point of death.

39  He said to me, Go thy way,
thy son liveth.

40  And my son was cured from
that hour.

41  Besides these, also many
others of the Jews, both men and
Women, cried out and said, He is
truly the Son of God, who cures
all diseases only by his word, and
to whom the devils are altogether
subject.

42  Some of them farther said,
This power can proceed from none
but God.

43  Pilate said to the Jews, Why
are not the devils subject to your
doctors?

44  Some of them said, The
power of subjecting devils cannot
proceed but from God.

45  But others said to Pilate,
That he had raised Lazarus from
the dead, after he had been four
days in his grave.

46  The governor hearing this,
trembling, said to the multitude of
the Jews, What will it profit you
to shed innocent blood?


CHAPTER VI.

     1 Pilate dismayed by the turbulence of the Jews,
     5 who demand Barabbas to be released, and Christ
     to be crucified.
     9 Pilate warmly expostulates with them,
     20 washes his hands of Christ's blood,
     23 and sentences him to be whipped and crucified.

THEN Pilate having called
together Nicodemus, and the
fifteen men who said that Jesus
was not born through fornication,
said to them, What shall I do,
seeing there is like to be a tumult
among the people.

2  They say unto him, We know
not; let them look to it who raise
the tumult.

3  Pilate then called the
multitude again, and said to them,
Ye know that ye have a custom, that
I should release to you one prisoner
at the feast of the passover:

4  I have a noted prisoner, a
murderer, who is called Barabbas,
and Jesus who is called Christ, in
whom I find nothing that deserves
death; which of them, therefore,
have you a mind that I should
release to you?

5  They all cry out, and say,
Release to us Barabbas.

6  Pilate saith to them, What
then shall I do with Jesus who is
called Christ?

7  They all answer, Let him be
crucified.

8  Again they cry out and say to
Pilate, You are not the friend of
Caesar, if you release this man;
for he hath declared that he is the
Son of God, and a king.  But are
you inclined that he should be
king, and not Caesar?

9  Then Pilate filled with anger
said to them, Your nation hath
always been seditious, and you are
always against those who have
been serviceable to you.

10  The Jews replied, Who are those
who have been serviceable to us?

11  Pilate answered them, Your
God who delivered you from the
hard bondage of the Egyptians,
and brought you over the Red Sea
as though it had been dry land,
and fed you in the wilderness with
manna and the flesh of quails, and
brought water out of the rock, and
gave you a law from heaven.

12  Ye provoked him all ways,
and desired for yourselves a
molten calf, and worshipped it,
and sacrificed to it, and said,
These are thy Gods, O Israel,
which brought thee out of the
land of Egypt:

13  On account of which your
God was inclined to destroy you;
but Moses interceded for you, and
your God heard him, and forgave
your iniquity.

14  Afterwards ye were enraged
against, and would have killed
your prophets, Moses and Aaron,
when they fled to the tabernacle,
and ye were always murmuring
against God and his prophets.

15  And arising from his
judgment seat, he would have gone
out; but the Jews all cried out,
We acknowledge Caesar to be king,
and not Jesus;

16  Whereas this person, as
soon as he was born, the wise
men came and offered gifts unto
him; which when Herod heard,
he was exceedingly troubled,
and would have killed him:

17  When his father knew this,
he fled with him and his mother
Mary into Egypt. Herod, when
he heard he was born, would have
slain him; and accordingly sent
and slew all the children which
were in Bethlehem, and in all the
coasts thereof, from two years old
and under.

18  When Pilate heard this
account, he was afraid; and
commanding silence among the
people, who made a noise, he said
to Jesus, Art thou therefore a king?

19  All the Jews replied to
Pilate, he is the very person
whom Herod sought to have slain.

20  Then Pilate taking water,
washed his hands before the people
and said, I am innocent of the
blood of this just person; look ye
to it.

21  The Jews answered and said,
His blood be upon us and our
children.

22  Then Pilate commanded Jesus
to be brought before him, and
spake to him in the following
words;

23  Thy own nation hath charged
thee as making thyself a king;
wherefore I, Pilate, sentence thee
to be whipped according to the
laws of former governors; and
that thou be first bound, then
hanged upon a cross in that place
where thou art now a prisoner;
and also two criminals with thee,
whose names are Dimas and Gestas.


CHAP. VII.

     1 Manner of Christ's crucifixion
     with the two thieves.

THEN Jesus went out of the
hall, and the two thieves
with him.

2  And when they came to the
place which is called Golgotha,
they stript him of his raiment, and
girt him about with a linen cloth,
and put a crown of thorns upon his
head, and put a reed in his hand.

3  And in like manner did they
to the two thieves who were
crucified with him, Dimas on his
right hand and Gestas on his left.

4  But Jesus said, My Father,
forgive them, For they know not
what they do.

5  And they divided his garments,
and upon his vesture they cast lots.

6  The people in the mean time
stood by, and the chief priests
and elders of the Jews mocked him,
saying, He saved others, let him
now save himself if he can; if he
be the son of God, let him now
come down from the cross.

7  The soldiers also mocked him,
and taking vinegar and gall, offered
it to him to drink, and said to him,
If thou art king of the Jews,
deliver thyself.

8  Then Longinus, a certain soldier,
taking a spear, pierced his side,
and presently there came forth blood
and water.

9  And Pilate wrote the title
upon the cross in Hebrew, Latin,
and Greek letters, viz., THIS IS
THE KING OF THE JEWS.

10  But one of the two thieves
who were crucified with Jesus,
whose name was Gestas, said to
Jesus, If thou art the Christ,
deliver thyself and us.

11 But the thief who was
crucified on his right hand,
whose name was Dimas, answering,
rebuked him, and said, Dost not
thou fear God, who art condemned
to this punishment? We indeed
receive rightly and justly the
demerit of our actions; but this
Jesus, what evil hath he done.

12  After this, groaning, he said
to Jesus, Lord, remember me
when thou comest into thy kingdom.

13  Jesus answering, said to
him, Verily I say unto thee, that
this day thou shalt be with me in
Paradise.


CHAPTER VIII.

     1 Miraculous appearance at his death.
     10 The Jews say the eclipse was natural.
     12 Joseph of Arimathaea embalms Christ's
     body and buries it.

AND it was about the sixth
hour, and darkness was upon
the face of the whole earth until
the ninth hour.

2  And while the sun was eclipsed,
behold the veil of the temple was
rent from the top, to the bottom;
and the rocks also were rent, and
the graves opened, and many
bodies of saints, which slept,
arose.

3  And about the ninth hour
Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani? which
being interpreted is, My God, My
God, why hast thou forsaken me?

4  And after these things, Jesus
said, Father, into thy hands I
commend my spirit; and having
said this, he gave up the ghost.

5  But when the centurion saw
that Jesus thus crying out gave up
the ghost, he glorified God, and
said, Of a truth this was a just
man.

6  And all the people who stood
by, were exceedingly troubled at
the sight; and reflecting upon
what had passed, smote upon their
breasts, and then returned to the
city of Jerusalem.

7  The centurion went to the
governor, and related to him all
that had passed:

8  And when he had heard all
these things, he was exceedingly
sorrowful;

9  And calling the Jews together,
said to them, Have ye seen the
miracle of the sun's eclipse, and
the other things which came to
pass, while Jesus was dying?

10  Which when the Jews heard,
they answered to the governor,
The eclipse of the sun happened
according to its usual custom.

11  But all those who were the
acquaintance of Christ, stood at
a distance, as did the women who
had followed Jesus from Galilee,
observing all these things.

12  And behold a certain man
of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who
was also a disciple of Jesus, but
not openly so, for fear of the Jews,
came to the governor, and entreated
the governor that he would give him
leave to take away the body of Jesus
from the cross.

13  And the governor gave him leave.

14  And Nicodemus came, bringing
with him a mixture of myrrh and
aloes about a hundred pounds
weight; and they took down Jesus
from the cross with tears, and
bound him in linen cloths with
spices, according to the custom of
burying among the Jews;

15  And placed him in a new
tomb, which Joseph had built,
and caused to be cut out of a rock,
in which never any man had been
put; and they rolled a great stone
to the door of the sepulchre.


CHAPTER IX.

     1 The Jews angry with Nicodemus:
     5 and with, Joseph of Arimathaea,
     7 whom they imprison.

WHEN the unjust Jews heard
that Joseph had begged and buried
the body of Jesus, they sought
after Nicodemus, and those fifteen
men who had testified before the
governor, that Jesus was not born
through fornication, and other
good persons who had shown any
good actions towards him.

2  But when they all concealed
themselves through fear of the
Jews, Nicodemus alone showed
himself to them, and said, How
can such persons as these enter
into the synagogue?

3  The Jews answered him, But
how durst thou enter into the
synagogue, who wast a confederate
with Christ? Let thy lot be along
with him in the other world.

4  Nicodemus answered, Amen;
so may it be, that I may have
my lot with him in his kingdom.

5  In like manner Joseph, when
he came to the Jews, said to them,
Why are ye angry with me for
desiring the body of Jesus of
Pilate? Behold, I have put him in
my tomb, and wrapped him up in
clean linen, and put a stone at the
door of the sepulchre:

6  I have acted rightly towards
him; but ye have acted unjustly
against that just person, in
crucifying him, giving him vinegar
to drink, crowning him with thorns,
tearing his body with whips, and
praying down the guilt of his blood
upon you.

7  The Jews at the hearing of
this were disquieted and troubled;
and they seized Joseph, and
commanded him to be put in custody
before the Sabbath, and kept there
till the Sabbath was over.

8  And they said to him, Make
confession; for at this time it is
not lawful to do thee any harm,
till the first day of the week come.
But we know that thou wilt not be
thought worthy of a burial; but
we will give thy flesh to the birds
of the air, and the beasts of the
earth.

9  Joseph answered, That speech
is like the speech of proud Goliath,
who reproached the living God in
speaking against David. But ye
scribes and doctors know that God
saith by the prophet, Vengeance is
mine, and I will repay to you evil
equal to that which ye have
threatened to me.

10  The God whom you have
hanged upon the cross, is able to
deliver me out of your hands. All
your wickedness will return upon
you.

11  For the governor, when he
washed his hands, said, I am clear
from the blood of this just person.
But ye answered and cried out,
His blood be upon us and our
children. According as ye have
said, may ye perish for ever.

12  The elders of the Jews hearing
these words, were exceedingly
enraged; and seizing Joseph, they
put him into a chamber where
there was no window; they fastened
the door, and put a seal upon
the lock;

13  And Annas and Caiaphas placed
a guard upon it, and took counsel
with the priests and Levites,
that they should all meet after
the Sabbath, and they contrived
to what death they should put Joseph.

14  When they had done this, the
rulers, Annas and Caiaphas,
ordered Joseph to be brought
forth.

(In this place there is a portion
of the Gospel lost or omitted.
which cannot be supplied. It
may, nevertheless, be surmised
from the occurrence related in
the next chapter, that the order
of Annas and Caiaphas were rendered
unnecessary by Joseph's miraculous
escape, and which was announced
to an assembly of people.)


CHAPTER X.

     1 Joseph's escape.
     2 The soldiers relate Christ's resurrection.
     18 Christ is seen preaching in Galilee.
     21 The Jews repent of their cruelty to him.

WHEN all the assembly heard
this (about Joseph's escape),
they admired and were astonished,
because they found the same seal
upon the lock of the chamber, and
could not find Joseph.

2 Then Annas and Caiaphas went
forth, and while they were all
admiring at Joseph's being gone,
behold one of the soldiers, who
kept the sepulchre of Jesus, spake
in the assembly,

3  That while they were guarding
the sepulchre of Jesus, there was
an earthquake; and we saw an angel
of God roll away the stone of the
sepulchre and sit upon it;

4  And his countenance was like
lightning and his garment like
snow; and we became through fear
like persons dead.

5  And we heard an angel saying
to the women at the sepulchre of
Jesus, Do not fear; I know that
you seek Jesus who was crucified;
he is risen as he foretold;

6  Come and see the place where
he was laid; and go presently, and
tell his disciples that he is risen
from the dead; and he will go before
you into Galilee; there ye shall
see him as he told you.

7  Then the Jews called together
all the soldiers who kept the sepulchre
of Jesus, and said to them, Who are
those women, to whom the angel spoke?
Why did ye not seize them.

8  The soldiers answered and said,
We know not who the women were;
besides we became as dead persons
through fear, and how could we
seize those women?

9  The Jews said to them, As the
Lord liveth, we do not believe you;

10  The soldiers answering said to
the Jews, when ye saw and heard
Jesus working so many miracles,
and did not believe him, how should
ye believe us? Ye well said,
As the Lord liveth, for the Lord
truly does live.

11  We have heard that ye shut
up Joseph, who buried the body of
Jesus, in a chamber, under a lock
which was sealed; and when ye
opened it, found him not there.

12  Do ye then produce Joseph
whom ye put under guard in the
chamber, and we will produce
Jesus whom we guarded in the
sepulchre.

13  The Jews answered and said,
We will produce Joseph, do ye
produce Jesus. But Joseph is in
his own city of Arimathaea.

14  The soldiers replied,
If Joseph be in Arimathaea,
and Jesus in Galilee, we heard
the angel inform the women.

15  The Jews hearing this, were
afraid, and said among themselves,
If by any means these things
should become public, then
everybody will believe in Jesus.

16  Then they gathered a large
sum of money, and gave it to the
soldiers, saying, Do ye tell the
people that the disciples of Jesus
came in the night when ye were
asleep, and stole away the body of
Jesus; and if Pilate the governor
should hear of this, we will satisfy
him and secure you.

17  The soldiers accordingly took
the money, and said as they were
instructed by the Jews; and their
report was spread abroad among
all the people.

18  But a certain priest Phinees,
Ada a schoolmaster, and a Levite,
named Ageus, they three came from
Galilee to Jerusalem, and told
the chief priests and all who
were in the synagogues, saying,

19  We have seen Jesus, whom
ye crucified, talking with his
eleven disciples, and sitting in the
midst of them in Mount Olivet,
and saying to them,

20  Go forth into the whole world,
preach the Gospel to all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost; and whosoever shall believe
and be baptized, shall be saved.

21  And when he had said these
things to his disciples, we saw him
ascending up to heaven.

22  When the chief priests and
elders, and Levites heard these
things, they said to these three
men, Give glory to the God of
Israel, and make confession to
him, whether those things are true,
which ye say ye have seen and heard.

23  They answering said, As the
Lord of our fathers liveth, the
God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
according as we heard Jesus talking
with his disciples, and according
as we saw him ascending up to
heaven, so we have related the
truth to you.

24  And the three men farther
answered, and said, adding these
words, If we should not own the
words which we heard Jesus speak,
and that we saw him ascending
into heaven, we should be guilty
of sin.

25  Then the chief priests
immediately rose up, and holding
the book of the law in their hands,
conjured these men, saying, Ye
shall no more hereafter declare
those things which ye have spoken
concerning Jesus.

26  And they gave them a large
sum of money, and sent other
persons along with them, who
should conduct them to their own
country, that they might not by any
means make any stay at Jerusalem.

27  Then the Jews did assemble
all together, and having expressed
the most lamentable concern said,
What is this extraordinary thing
which is come to pass in Jerusalem?

28  But Annas and Caiaphas comforted
them, saying, Why should we believe
the soldiers who guarded the sepulchre
of Jesus, in telling us, that an angel
rolled away the stone from the door
of the sepulchre?

29  Perhaps his own disciples told
them this, and gave them money
that they should say so, and they
themselves took away the body of Jesus.

30  Besides, consider this, that
there is no credit to be given to
foreigners, because they also took
a large sum of us, and they have
declared to us according to the
instructions which we gave them.
They must either be faithful to us
or to the disciples of Jesus.


CHAPTER XI.

     1 Nicodemus counsels the Jews.
     6 Joseph found.
     11 Invited by the Jews to return.
     19 Relates the manner of his miraculous escape.

THEN Nicodemus arose, and
said, Ye say right, O sons of
Israel; ye have heard what those
three men have sworn by the Law
of God, who said, We have seen
Jesus speaking with his disciples
upon mount Olivet, and we saw
him ascending up to heaven.

2  And the scripture teacheth
us that the blessed prophet Elijah
was taken up to heaven, and Elisha
being asked by the sons of the
prophets, Where is our father Elijah?
He said to them, that he is taken up
to heaven.

3  And the sons of the prophets
said to him, Perhaps the spirit
hath carried him into one of the
mountains of Israel, there perhaps
we shall find him. And they besought
Elisha, and he walked about with
them three days, and they could
not find him.

4  And now hear me, O sons of
Israel, and let us send men into
the mountains of Israel, lest
perhaps the spirit hath carried
away Jesus, and there perhaps we
shall find him, and be satisfied.

5  And the counsel of Nicodemus
pleased all the people; and they
sent forth men who sought for Jesus,
but could not find him; and they
returning, said, We went all about,
but could not find Jesus, but we
have found Joseph in his city of
Arimathaea.

6  The rulers hearing this, and
all the people, were glad, and
praised the God of Israel, because
Joseph was found, whom they had
shut up in a chamber, and could
not find.

7  And when they had formed a
large assembly, the chief priests
said, By what means shall we bring
Joseph to us to speak with him?

8  And taking a piece of paper,
they wrote to him, and said, Peace
be with thee, and all thy family,
We know that we have offended
against God and thee. Be pleased
to give a visit to us, your fathers,
for we were perfectly surprised at
your escape from prison.

9  We know that it was malicious
counsel which we took against
thee, and that the Lord took care
of thee, and the Lord himself
delivered thee from our designs.
Peace be unto thee, Joseph, who
art honourable among all the
people.

10  And they chose seven of
Joseph's friends, and said to them,
When ye come to Joseph, salute
him in peace, and give him this
letter.

11  Accordingly, when the men
came to Joseph, they did salute
him in peace, and gave him the
letter.

12  And when Joseph had read it,
he said, Blessed be the Lord God,
who didst deliver me from the
Israelites, that they could not
shed my blood. Blessed be God,
who hast protected me under thy
wings.

13  And Joseph kissed them, and
took them into his house. And on
the morrow, Joseph mounted his
ass, and went along with them to
Jerusalem.

14  And when all the Jews heard
these things, they went out to
meet him, and cried out, saying,
Peace attend thy coming hither,
father Joseph.

15  To which he answered,
Prosperity from the Lord attend
all the people.

13  And they all kissed him; and
Nicodemus took him to his house,
having prepared a large
entertainment.

17  But on the morrow, being
a preparation-day, Annas, and
Caiaphas, and Nicodemus, said to
Joseph, Make confession to the
God of Israel, and answer to us
all those questions which we shall
ask thee;

18  For we have been very much
troubled, that thou didst bury the
body of Jesus; and that when we
had locked thee in a chamber, we
could not find thee; and we have
been afraid ever since, till this
time of thy appearing among us.
Tell us therefore before God, all
that came to pass.

19  Then Joseph answering,
said Ye did indeed put me under
confinement, on the day of
preparation, till the morning.

20  But while I was standing at
prayer in the middle of the night,
the house was surrounded with
four angels; and I saw Jesus as
the brightness of the sun, and fell
down upon the earth for fear.

21  But Jesus laying hold on my
hand, lifted me from the ground,
and the dew was then sprinkled
upon me; but he, wiping my face,
kissed me, and said unto me, Fear
not, Joseph; look upon me for
it is I.

22  Then I looked upon him, and
said, Rabboni Elias! He answered
me, I am not Elias, but Jesus of
Nazareth, whose body thou didst
bury.

23  I said to him, show me the
tomb in which I laid thee.

24  Then Jesus, taking me by the
hand, led me unto the place where
I laid him, and showed me the
linen clothes, and napkin which I
put round his head. Then I knew
that it was Jesus, and worshipped
him, and said; Blessed be he who
cometh in the name of the Lord.

25  Jesus again taking me by the
hand, led me to Arimathaea, to my
own house, and said to me, Peace
be to thee; but go not out of thy
house till the fortieth day; but
I must go to my disciples.


CHAPTER XII.

     1 The Jews astonished and confounded.
     16 Simeon's two sons, Charinus and Lenthius,
     rise from the dead at Christ's crucifixion.
     19 Joseph proposes to get them to relate the
     mysteries of their resurrection.
     21 They are sought and found,
     22 brought to the synagogue,
     23 privately sworn to secrecy,
     25 and undertake to write what they had seen.

WHEN the chief priests and
Levites heard all these
things, they were astonished, and
fell down with their faces on the
ground as dead men, and crying
out to one another, said, What is
this extraordinary sign which is
come to pass in Jerusalem? We
know the father and mother of
Jesus.

2  And a certain Levite said,
I know many of his relations,
religions persons, who are wont to
offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings
to the God of Israel, in the temple,
with prayers.

3  And when the high-priest
Simeon took him up in his arms,
he said to him, Lord, now lettest
thou thy servant depart in peace,
according to thy word; for mine
eyes have seen thy salvation,
which then halt prepared before
the face of all people; a light to
enlighten the Gentiles, and the
glory of thy people Israel.

4  Simeon in like manner blessed
Mary the Mother of Jesus, and
said to her, I declare to thee
concerning that child; He is
appointed for the fall and rising
again of many, and for a sign
which shall be spoken against;

5  Yea, a sword shall pierce
through thine own soul also, and
the thoughts of many hearts shall
be revealed.

6  Then said all the Jews, Let
us send to those three men, who
said they saw him talking with
his disciples in mount Olivet.

7  After this, they asked them
what they had seen; who answered
with one accord, In the presence
of the God of Israel we affirm,
that we plainly saw Jesus talking
with his disciples in Mount Olivet,
and ascending up to heaven.

8  Then Annas and Caiaphas took
them into separate places, and
examined them separately; who
unanimously confessed the truth,
and said, they had seen Jesus.

9  Then Annas and Caiaphas said
"Our law saith, By the mouth of
two or three witnesses every word
shall be established."

10  But what have we said?
The blessed Enoch pleased God,
and was translated by the word of
God; and the burying-place of the
blessed Moses is known.

11  But Jesus was delivered to
Pilate, whipped, crowned with
thorns, spit upon, pierced with a
spear, crucified, died upon the
cross, and was buried, and his
body the honourable Joseph buried
in a new sepulchre, and he testifies
that he saw him alive.

12  And besides, these men have
declared, that they saw him talking
with his disciples in Mount Olivet,
and ascending up to heaven.

13  Then Joseph rising up, said
to Annas and Caiaphas, Ye may be
justly under a great surprise,
that you have been told, that
Jesus is alive, and gone up to
heaven.

14  It is indeed a thing really
surprising, that he should not
only himself arise from the dead,
but also raise others from their
graves, who have been seen by
many in Jerusalem.

15  And now hear me a little
We all knew the blessed Simeon,
the high-priest, who took Jesus
when an infant into his arms in
the temple.

16  This same Simeon had two sons
of his own, and we were all present
at their death and funeral.

17  Go therefore and see their
tombs, for these are open, and
they are risen: and behold, they
are in the city of Arimathaea,
spending their time together in
offices of devotion.

18  Some, indeed, have heard
the sound of their voices in prayer,
but they will not discourse with
anyone, but they continue as mute
as dead men.

19  But come, let us go to them,
and behave ourselves towards them
with all due respect and caution.
And if we can bring them to swear,
perhaps they will tell us some of
the mysteries of their resurrection.

20  When the Jews heard this
they were exceedingly rejoiced.

21  Then Annas and Caiaphas,
Nicodemus, Joseph, and Gamaliel,
went to Arimathaea, but did not
find them in their graves; but
walking about the city, they found
them on their bended knees at
their devotions:

22  Then saluting them with all
respect and deference to God, they
brought them to the synagogue at
Jerusalem; and having shut the
gates, they took the book of the
law of the Lord,

23  And putting it in their hands,
swore them by God Adonai, and
the God of Israel, who spake to
our fathers by the law and the
prophets, saying, If ye believe
him who raised you from the dead,
to be Jesus, tell us what ye have
seen, and how ye were raised from
the dead.

24 Charinus and Lenthius, the
two sons of Simeon, trembled
when they heard these things, and
were disturbed, and groaned; and
at the same time looking up to
heaven, they made the sign of the
cross with their fingers on their
tongues,

25  And immediately they spake,
and said, Give each of us some
paper, and we will write down for
you all those things which we have
seen. And they each sat down
and wrote, saying:--


CHAPTER XIII.

     1 The narrative of Charinus and Lenthius commences.
     3 A great light in hell.
     7 Simeon arrives, and announces the coming of Christ.

O LORD Jesus and Father, who
art God, also the resurrection
and life of the dead, give us
leave to declare thy mysteries,
which we saw after death, belonging
to thy cross; for we are sworn by
thy name.

2  For thou hast forbidden thy
servants to declare the secret
things, which were wrought by
thy divine power in hell.

3  When we were Placed with
our fathers in the dept of hell,
in the blackness of darkness,
on a sudden there appeared the
colour of the sun like gold,
and a substantial purple-coloured
light enlightening the place.

4  Presently upon this, Adam,
the father of all mankind, with
all the patriarchs and prophets,
rejoiced and said, That light is the
author of everlasting light, who
hath promised to translate us to
everlasting light.

5  Then Isaiah the prophet cried
out and said, This is the light
of the Father, and the Son of God,
according to my prophecy, when I
was alive upon earth.

6  The land of Zabulon, and the
land of Nephthalim, beyond Jordan,
a people who walked in darkness,
saw a great light; and to them
who dwelled in the region of the
shadow of death, light is arisen.
And now he is come, and hath
enlightened us who sat in death.

7  And while we were all rejoicing
in the light which shone upon us,
our father Simeon came among us,
and congratulating all the company,
said, Glorify the Lord Jesus Christ
the Son of God.

8 Whom I took up in my arms when
an infant in the temple, and
being moved by the Holy Ghost,
said to him, and acknowledged,
That now mine eyes have seen thy
salvation, which thou hast prepared
before the face of all people; a
light to enlighten the Gentiles,
and the glory of thy people Israel.

9  All the saints who were in
the depth of hell, hearing this,
rejoiced the more.

10  Afterwards there came forth
one like a little hermit, and was
asked by every one, Who art thou?

11  To which he replied, I am
the voice of one crying in the
wilderness, John the Baptist, and
the prophet of the Most High, who
went before his coming to prepare
his way, to give the knowledge of
salvation to his people for the
forgiveness of sins.

12  And I, John, when I saw
Jesus coming to me, being moved
by the Holy Ghost, I said, Behold
the Lamb of God, behold him who
takes away the sins of the world.

13  And I baptized him in the
river Jordan, and saw the Holy
Ghost descending upon him in the
form of a dove, and heard a voice
from heaven saying, This is my
beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased.

14  And now while I was going
before him, I came down hither to
acquaint you, that the Son of God
will next visit us, and, as the
day-spring from on high, will come to
us, who are in darkness and the
shadow of death.


CHAPTER XIV.

     1 Adam causes Seth to relate what he heard
     from Michael the archangel, when he sent him
     to Paradise to entreat God to anoint his
     head in his sickness.

BUT when the first man our father
Adam heard these things, that
Jesus was baptized in Jordan,
he called out to his son Seth,
and said,

2  Declare to your sons, the
patriarchs and prophets, all those
things, which thou didst hear from
Michael, the archangel, when I
sent thee to the gates of Paradise,
to entreat God that he would
anoint my head when I was sick.

3  Then Seth, coming near to the
patriarchs and prophets, said, I,
Seth, when I was praying to God
at the gates of Paradise, beheld
the angel of the Lord, Michael,
appear unto me, saying, I am sent
unto thee from the Lord; I am
appointed to preside over human
bodies.

4  I tell thee, Seth, do not pray
to God in tears, and entreat him
for the oil of the tree of mercy
wherewith to anoint thy father
Adam for his head-ache;

5  Because thou canst not by any
means obtain it till the last day
and times, namely, till five thousand
and five hundred years be past.

6  Then will Christ, the most
merciful Son of God, come on
earth to raise again the human
body of Adam, and at the same
time to raise the bodies of the
dead, and when he cometh he will
be baptized in Jordan;

7  Then with the oil of his
mercy he will anoint all those
who believe in him; and the oil
of his mercy will continue to
future generations, for those
who shall be born of the water
and the Holy Ghost unto eternal
life.

8  And when at that time the
most merciful Son of God, Christ
Jesus, shall come down on earth,
he will introduce our father Adam
into Paradise, to the tree of mercy.

9 When all the patriarchs and
prophets heard all these things
from Seth, they rejoiced more.


CHAPTER XV.

     1 Quarrel between Satan and the prince of hell,
     concerning the expected arrival of Christ in hell.

WHILE all the saints were
rejoicing, behold Satan, the
prince and captain of death, said
to the prince of hell,

2  Prepare to receive Jesus of
Nazareth himself, who boasted
that he was the Son of God, and
yet was a man afraid of death, and
said, My soul is sorrowful even to
death.

3  Besides he did many injuries
to me and to many others; for
those whom I made blind and lame
and those also whom I tormented
with several devils, he cured by
his word; yea, and those whom I
brought dead to thee, he by force
takes away from thee.

4  To this the prince of hell
replied to Satan, Who is that so
powerful prince, and yet a man who
is afraid of death?

5  For all the potentates of the
earth are subject to my power,
whom thou broughtest to subjection
by thy power.

6  But if he be so powerful in his
human nature, I affirm to thee for
truth, that he is almighty in his
divine nature, and no man can
resist his power:

7  When therefore he said he was
afraid of death, he designed to
ensnare thee, and unhappy it will be
to thee for everlasting ages,

8  Then Satan replying, said to
the prince of hell, Why didst thou
express a doubt, and wast afraid to
receive that Jesus of Nazareth,
both thy adversary and mine?

9  As for me, I tempted him and
stirred up my old people the Jews
with zeal and anger against him;

10  I sharpened the spear for his
suffering; I mixed the gall and
vinegar, and commanded that he
should drink it; I prepared the
cross to crucify him, and the nails
to pierce through his hands and
feet; and now his death is near
at hand, I will bring him hither,
subject both to thee and me.

11  Then the prince of hell
answering, said, Thou saidst to me
just now, that he took away the
dead from me by force.

12  They who have been kept here
till they should live again upon
earth, were taken away hence,
not by their own power, but by
prayers made to God, and their
almighty God took them from me.

13  Who then is that Jesus of
Nazareth that by his word hath
taken away the dead from me
without prayer to God?

14  Perhaps it is the same who
took away from me Lazarus, after
he had been four days dead, and
did both stink and was rotten, and
of whom I had possession as a dead
person, yet he brought him to life
again by his power.

15  Satan answering, replied to
the prince of hell, It is the very
same person, Jesus of Nazareth.

16  Which when the prince of hell
heard, he said to him, I adjure
thee by the powers which belong
to thee and me, that thou bring
him not to me.

17  For when I heard of the power
of his word, I trembled for fear,
and all my impious company were
at the same disturbed;

18  And we were not able to detain
Lazarus, but he gave himself a
shake, and with all the signs of
malice he immediately went away
from us; and the very earth, in
which the dead body of Lazarus
was lodged, presently turned him
out alive.

19  And I know now that he is
Almighty God who could perform
such things, who is mighty in his
dominion, and mighty in his human
nature, who is the Saviour of
mankind.

20  Bring not therefore this person
hither, for he will set at liberty
all those whom I hold in prison
under unbelief, and bound with
the fetters of their sins, and will
conduct them to everlasting life.


CHAPTER XVI.

     1 Christ's arrival at hell-gates;
     the confusion thereupon.
     19 He descends into hell.

AND while Satan and the Prince
of hell were discoursing thus
to each other, on a sudden there
was a voice as of thunder, and the
rushing of winds, saying, Lift up
your gates, O ye princes; and be
ye lift up, O everlasting gates,
and the King of Glory shall come in.

2  When the prince of hell heard
this, he said to Satan, Depart from
me, and begone out of my habitations;
if thou art a powerful warrior,
fight with the King of Glory.
But what hast thou to do with
him?

3  And he cast him forth from his
habitations.

4  And the prince said to his
impious officers, Shut the brass gates
of cruelty, and make them fast with
iron bars, and fight courageously,
lest we be taken captives.

5  But when all the company of
the saints heard this they spake
with a loud voice of anger to the
prince of hell,

6  Open thy gates, that the King
of Glory may come in.

7  And the divine prophet David
cried out, saying, Did not I, when
on earth, truly prophesy and say,
O that men would praise the Lord
for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children
of men!

8  For he hath broken the gates
of brass, and cut the bars of iron
in sunder. He hath taken them
because of their iniquity, and
because of their unrighteousness
they are afflicted.

9  After this, another prophet,
namely, holy Isaiah, spake in like
manner to all the saints, Did not
I rightly prophesy to you when I
was alive on earth?

10  The dead men shall live, and
they shall rise again who are in
their graves, and they shall rejoice
who are in the earth; for the dew
which is from the Lord, shall
bring deliverance to them.

11  And I said in another place,
O grave, where is thy victory?
O death, where is thy sting?

12  When all the saints heard
these things spoken by Isaiah,
they said to the prince of hell,
Open now thy gates, and take
away thine iron bars; for thou
wilt now be bound, and have no
power.

13  Then was there a great voice,
as of the sound of thunder, saying,
Lift up your gates, O princes; and
be ye lifted up, ye gates of hell,
and the King of Glory will enter
in.

14  The prince of hell perceiving
the same voice repeated, cried out,
as though he had been ignorant,
Who is that King of Glory?

15  David replied to the prince
of hell, and said, I understand the
words of that voice, because I
spake them in his spirit. And now,
as I have before said, I say unto
thee, the Lord strong and powerful,
the Lord mighty in battle: he is
the King of Glory, and he is the
Lord in heaven and in earth.

16  He hath looked down to hear
the groans of the prisoners, and to
set loose those that are appointed
to death.

17  And now, thou filthy and
stinking prince of hell, open thy
gates, that the King of Glory may
enter in; for he is the Lord of
heaven and earth.

18  While David was saying this,
the mighty Lord appeared in the
form of a man, and enlightened
those places which had ever before
been in darkness.

19  And broke asunder the fetters
which before could not be broken;
and with his invincible power
visited those who sate in the deep
darkness by iniquity, and the shadow
of death by sin.


CHAPTER XVII.

     1 Death and the devils in great horror
     at Christ's coming.
     13 He tramples on death, seizes the prince
     of hell, and takes Adam with him to Heaven.

IMPIOUS death and her cruel
officers hearing these things,
were seized with fear in their
several kingdoms, when they saw
the clearness of the light,

2  And Christ himself on a sudden
appearing in their habitations,
they cried out therefore, and said,
We are bound by thee; thou seemest
to intend our confusion before
the Lord.

3  Who art thou, who has no signs
of corruption, but that bright
appearance which is a full proof of
thy greatness, of which yet thou
seemest to take no notice?

4  Who art thou, so powerful,
and so weak, so great and so little;
mean, and yet a soldier of the first
rank, who can command in the form
of a servant and a common soldier?

5  The king of Glory, dead and
alive, though once slain upon the
cross?

6  Who layest dead in the grave,
and art come down alive to us,
and in thy death all the creatures
trembled, and all the stars were
moved; and now hast thy liberty
among the dead, and givest
disturbance to our legions?

7  Who art thou, who dost release
the captives that were held
in chains by original sin, and
bringest them into their former
liberty?

8  Who art thou, who dost spread
so glorious and divine a light over
those who were made blind by the
darkness of sin?

9  In like manner all the legions
of devils were seized with the like
horror, and with the most submissive
fear cried out, and said,

10  Whence comes it, O thou
Jesus Christ, that thou art a man
so powerful and glorious in majesty
so bright as to have no spot, and
so pure as to have no crime? For
that lower world of earth, which
was ever till now subject to us,
and from whence we received
tribute, never sent us such a
dead man before, never sent such
presents as these to the princes of
hell.

11  Who therefore art thou, who
with such courage enterest among
our abodes, and art not only not
afraid to threaten us with the
greatest punishments, but also
endeavourest to rescue all others
from the chains in which we hold
them?

12  Perhaps thou art that Jesus,
of whom Satan just now spoke to
our prince, that by the death of
the cross thou wert about to
receive the power of death.

13  Then the King of Glory
trampling upon death, seized the
prince of hell, deprived him of all
his power, and took our earthly
father Adam with him to his glory.


CHAPTER XVIII.

     1 Beelzebub, prince of hell, vehemently upbraids Satan for
     persecuting Christ and bringing him to hell.
     14 Christ gives Beelzebub dominion over Satan forever,
     as a recompence for taking away Adam and his sons.

THEN the prince of hell took
Satan, and with great indignation
said to him, O thou prince of
destruction, author of Beelzebub's
defeat and banishment, the scorn
of God's angels and loathed by all
righteous persons! What inclined
thee to act thus?

2  Thou wouldst crucify the King
of Glory, and by his destruction,
hast made us promises of very
large advantages, but as a fool
wert ignorant of what thou wast
about.

3  For behold now that Jesus of
Nazareth, with the brightness of
his glorious divinity, puts to flight
all the horrid powers of darkness
and death;

4  He has broke down our prisons
from top to bottom, dismissed
all the captives, released all
who were bound, and all who were
wont formerly to groan under the
weight of their torments, have
now insulted us, and we are like
to be defeated by their prayers.

5  Our impious dominions are
subdued, and no part of mankind
is now left in our subjection, but
on the other hand, they all boldly
defy us;

6  Though, before, the dead never
durst behave themselves insolently
towards us, nor being prisoners,
could ever on any occasion be
merry.

7  O Satan, thou prince of all
the wicked, father of the impious
and abandoned, why wouldest thou
attempt this exploit, seeing our
prisoners were hitherto always
without the least hope of
salvation and life?

8  But now there is not one of
them does ever groan, nor is there
the least appearance of a tear in
any of their faces.

9  O prince Satan, thou great
keeper of the infernal regions,
all thy advantages which thou didst
acquire by the forbidden tree, and
the loss of Paradise, thou hast
now lost by the wood of the
cross;

10  And thy happiness all then
expired, when thou didst crucify
Jesus Christ the King of Glory.

11  Thou hast acted against thine
own interest and mine, as thou
wilt presently perceive by those
large torments and infinite
punishments which thou art
about to suffer.

12 O Satan, prince of all evil,
author of death, and source of all
pride, thou shouldest first have
inquired into the evil crimes of
Jesus of Nazareth, and then thou
wouldest have found that he was
guilty of no fault worthy of death.

13  Why didst thou venture,
without either reason or justice,
to crucify him, and hast brought
down to our regions a person
innocent and righteous, and thereby
hast lost all the sinners, impious
and unrighteous persons in the
whole world?

14  While the prince of hell was
thus speaking to Satan, the King
of Glory said to Beelzebub the
prince of hell, Satan the prince
shall be subject to thy dominions
for ever, in the room of Adam and
his righteous sons, who are mine,


CHAPTER XIX.

     1 Christ takes Adam by the hand,
     the rest of the saints join hands,
     and they all ascend with him to Paradise.

THEN Jesus stretched forth his
hand, and said, Come to me,
all ye my saints, who were created
in my image, who were condemned
by the tree of the forbidden fruit,
and by the devil and death;

2  Live now by the wood of my
cross; the devil, the prince of this
world, is overcome, and death is
conquered,

3  Then presently all the saints
were joined together under the
hand of the most high God; and
the Lord Jesus laid hold on Adam's
hand, and said to him, Peace be
to thee, and all thy righteous
posterity, which is mine.

4  Then Adam, casting himself
at the feet of Jesus, addressed
himself to him with tears, in
humble language, and a loud voice,
saying,

5  "I will extol thee, O Lord, for
thou halt lifted me up, and hast
not made my foes to rejoice over
me. O Lord my God, I cried
unto thee, and thou hast healed
me."

6  "O Lord thou hast brought up
my soul from the grave; thou
hast kept me alive, that I should
not go down to the pit."

7  "Sing unto the Lord, all ye
saints of his, and give thanks at
the remembrance of his holiness,
for his anger endureth but for a
moment; in his favour is life."

8  In like manner all the saints,
prostrate at the feet of Jesus,
said with one voice, Thou art come,
O Redeemer of the world, and hast
actually accomplished all things,
which thou didst foretell by the
law and thy holy prophets.

9  Thou hast redeemed the living
by thy cross, and art come down
to us, that by the death of the
cross thou mightest deliver us
from hell, and by thy power from
death.

10  O Lord, as thou hast put the
ensigns of thy glory in heaven,
and hast set up the sign of thy
redemption, even thy cross on earth;
so, Lord, set the sign of the victory
of thy cross in hell, that death
may have dominion no longer.

11  Then the Lord stretching
forth his hand, made the sign of
the cross upon Adam, and upon
all his saints.

12  And taking hold of Adam by
his right hand, he ascended from
hell, and all the saints of God
followed him.

13  Then the royal prophet, David,
boldly cried, and said, O sing
unto the Lord a new song, for he
hath done marvellous things; his
right hand and his holy arm have
gotten him the victory.

14  The Lord hath made known
his salvation, his righteousness
hath he openly shewn in the sight
of the heathen.

15  And the whole multitude of
saints answered, saying, This
honour have all his saints, Amen,
Praise ye the Lord.

16  Afterwards, the prophet
Habbakuk cried out, and said,
Thou wentest forth for the salvation
of thy people, even for salvation
with thine anointed.

17  And all the saints said,
Blessed is he who cometh in the
name of the Lord; for the Lord
hath enlightened us. This is our
God for ever and ever; he shall
reign over us to everlasting ages.
Amen.

18  In like manner all the prophets
spake the sacred things of his
praise, and followed the Lord.


CHAPTER XX.

     1 Christ delivers Adam to Michael the archangel.
     3 They meet Enoch and Elijah in heaven,
     5 and also the blessed thief, who relates
     how he came to Paradise.

THEN the Lord, holding Adam
by the hand, delivered him
to Michael the archangel; and he
led them into Paradise, filled with
mercy and glory;

2  And two very ancient men
met them, and were asked by the
saints, Who are ye, who have not
yet been with us in hell, and have
had your bodies placed in Paradise?

3  One of them answering, said,
I am Enoch, who was translated
by the word of God: and this man
who is with me, is Elijah the
Tishbite, who was translated in a
fiery chariot.

4  Here we have hitherto been,
and have not tasted death, but are
now about to return at the coming
of Antichrist, being armed with
divine signs and miracles, to
engage with him in battle, and to be
slain by him at Jerusalem, and to
be taken up alive again into the
clouds, after three days and a
half.

5  And while the holy Enoch
and Elias were relating this,
behold there came another man in a
miserable figure, carrying the sign
of the cross upon his shoulders.

6  And when all the saints saw
him, they said to him, Who art
thou? For thy countenance is like
a thief's; and why dost thou carry
a cross upon thy shoulders?

7  To which he answering, said,
Ye say right, for I was a thief,
who committed all sorts of wickedness
upon earth.

8  And the Jews crucified me
with Jesus; and I observed the
surprising things which happened
in the creation at the crucifixion
of the Lord Jesus.

9  And I believed him to be the
Creator of all things, and the
Almighty King; and I prayed to
him, saying, Lord remember me,
when thou comest into thy kingdom.

10  He presently regarded my
supplication, and said to me,
Verily I say unto thee, this day
thou shalt be with me in Paradise.

11  And he gave me this sign of
the cross, saying, Carry this, and
go to Paradise; and if the angel
who is the guard of Paradise will
not admit thee, show him the sign
of the cross, and say unto him
Jesus Christ who is now crucified,
hath sent me hither to thee.

12  When I did this and told the
angel who is the guard of Paradise
all these things, and he heard
them, he presently opened the
gates, introduced me, and placed
me on the right hand in Paradise,

13  Saying, Stay here a little
time, till Adam, the father of all
mankind, shall enter in, with all
his sons, who are the holy and
righteous servants of Jesus Christ,
who was crucified.

14  When they heard all this
account from the thief, all the
patriarchs said with one voice,
Blessed be thou, O Almighty God,
the Father of everlasting goodness,
and the Father of mercies, who hast
shown such favour to those who were
sinners against him, and hast
brought them to the mercy of
Paradise, and hast placed them
amidst thy large and spiritual
provisions, in a spiritual and
holy life.  Amen.


CHAPTER XXI.

     1 Charinus and Lenthius being only allowed
     three days to remain on earth,
     7 deliver in their narratives, which miraculously
     correspond; they vanish,
     13 and Pilate records these transactions.

THESE are the divine and
sacred mysteries which we saw
and heard. We, Charinus and
Lenthius are not allowed to declare
the other mysteries of God, as the
archangel Michael ordered us,

2  Saying, ye shall go with my
brethren to Jerusalem, and shall
continue in prayers, declaring and
glorifying the resurrection of
Jesus Christ, seeing he hath raised
you from the dead at the same
time with himself.

3  And ye shall not talk with
any man, but sit as dumb persons
till the time come when the Lord
will allow you to relate the
mysteries of his divinity.

4  The archangel Michael farther
commanded us to go beyond Jordan,
to an excellent and fat country,
where there are many who rose
from the dead along with us
for the proof of the resurrection
of Christ.

5  For we have only three days
allowed us from the dead, who
arose to celebrate the passover of
our Lord with our parents, and to
bear our testimony for Christ the
Lord, and we have been baptized
in the holy river of Jordan. And
now they are not seen by any one.

6  This is as much as God allowed
us to relate to you; give ye
therefore praise and honour to
him, and repent, and he will have
mercy upon you. Peace be to you
from the Lord God Jesus Christ,
and the Saviour of us all. Amen,
Amen, Amen.

7  And after they had made an
end of writing, and had written
on two distinct pieces of paper,
Charinus gave what he wrote into the
hands of Annas, and Caiaphas, and
Gamaliel.

8  Lenthius likewise gave what
he wrote into the hands of Nicodemus
and Joseph; and immediately they
were changed into exceeding white
forms and were seen no more.

9  But what they had written
was found perfectly to agree, the
one not containing one letter more
or less than the other.

10  When all the assembly of the
Jews heard all these surprising
relations of Charinus and Lenthius,
they said to each other, Truly all
these things were wrought by
God, and blessed be the Lord Jesus
for ever and ever, Amen.

11  And they went all out with
great concern, and fear, and
trembling, and smote upon their
breasts and went away every one
to his home.

12  But immediately all these
things which were related by the
Jews in their synagogues concerning
Jesus, were presently told by Joseph
and Nicodemus to the governor.

13  And Pilate wrote down all
these transactions, and placed all
these accounts in the public records
of his hall.


CHAPTER XXII.

     1 Pilate goes to the temple; calls together
     the rulers, and scribes, and doctors.
     2 Commands the gates to be shut;
     orders the book of the Scriptures; and
     causes the Jews to relate what they really
     knew concerning Christ.
     14 They declare that they crucified Christ
     in ignorance, and that they now know him
     to be the Son of God, according to the
     testimony of the Scriptures; which,
     after they put him to death, were examined.

AFTER these things Pilate went
to the temple of the Jews,
and called together all the rulers
and scribes, and doctors of the
law, and went with them into a
chapel of the temple.

2  And commanding that all the
gates should be shut, said to them,
I have heard that ye have a certain
large book in this temple; I desire
you, therefore, that it may be
brought before me.

3  And when the great book,
carried by four ministers of the
temple, and adorned with gold and
precious stones, was brought,
Pilate said to them all, I adjure
you by the God of your Fathers,
who made and commanded this temple
to be built, that ye conceal not the
truth from me.

4  Ye know all the things which
are written in that book; tell me
therefore now, if ye in the
Scriptures have found any thing of
that Jesus whom ye crucified, and at
what time of the world he, ought
to have come: show it me.

5  Then having sworn Annas and
Caiaphas, they commanded all the
rest who were with them to go out
of the chapel.

6  And they shut the gates of the
temple and of the chapel, and said
to Pilate, Thou hast made us to
swear, O judge, by the building of
this temple, to declare to thee that
which is true and right.

7  After we had crucified Jesus,
not knowing that he was the Son
of God, but supposing he wrought
his miracles by some magical arts,
we summoned a large assembly in
this temple.

8  And when we were deliberating
among one another about the
miracles which Jesus had wrought,
we found many witnesses of our
own country, who declared that
they had seen him alive after his
death, and that they heard him
discoursing with his disciples, and
saw him ascending into the height
of the heavens, and entering into
them;

9  And we saw two witnesses,
whose bodies Jesus raised from the
dead, who told us of many strange
things which Jesus did among the
dead, of which we have a written
account in our hands.

10  And it is our custom annually
to open this holy book before an
assembly, and to search there for
the counsel of God.

11  And we found in the first of
the seventy books, where Michael
the archangel is speaking to the
third son of Adam the first man,
an account that after five thousand
five hundred years, Christ the
most beloved son of God was to
come on earth,

12  And we further considered,
that perhaps he was the very God
of Israel who spoke to Moses,
Thou shalt make the ark of the
testimony; two cubits and a half
shall be the length thereof, and a
cubit and a half the breadth thereof,
and a cubit and a half the height
thereof.

13  By these five cubits and a
half for the building of the ark
of the Old Testament, we perceived
and knew that in five thousand
years and half (one thousand) years,
Jesus Christ was to come in the
ark or tabernacle of a body;

14  And so our Scriptures testify
that he is the Son of God, and the
Lord and King of Israel.

15  And because after his suffering,
our chief priests were surprised
at the signs which were wrought
by his means, we opened that book
to search all the generations down
to the generation of Joseph and
Mary the mother of Jesus,
supposing him to be of the
seed of David;

16  And we found the account of
the creation, and at what time he
made the heaven and the earth,
and the first man Adam, and that
from thence to the flood, were two
thousand seven hundred and forty-
eight years.

17  And from the flood to Abraham,
nine hundred and twelve.
And from Abraham to Moses, four
hundred and thirty. And from
Moses to David the King, five
hundred and ten.

18  And from David to the Babylonish
captivity five hundred years.
And from the Babylonish captivity
to the incarnation of Christ, four
hundred years.

19  The sum of all which amounts
to five thousand and half (a thousand.)

20  And so it appears, that Jesus
whom we crucified, is Jesus Christ
the Son of God, and true Almighty
God. Amen.

(In the name of the Holy Trinity,
thus end the acts of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, which the Emperor
Theodosius the Great found at
Jerusalem, in the hall of Pontius
Pilate, among the public records;
the things were acted in the
nineteenth year of Tiberius Caesar,
Emperor of the Romans, and in
the seventeenth year of the
government of Herod, the son of
Herod and of Galilee, on the
eighth of the calends of April,
which is the twenty-third day of
the month of March, in the CCIId
Olympiad, when Joseph and Caiaphas
were rulers of the Jews; being a
History written in Hebrew by
Nicodemus, of what happened after
our Saviour's crucifixion.)


            REFERENCES TO THE GOSPEL OF NICODEMUS, FORMERLY
                   CALLED THE ACTS OF PONTIUS PILATE.

[Although this Gospel is, by some among the learned, supposed to have
been really written by Nicodemus, who became a disciple of Jesus Christ,
and conversed with him; others conjecture that it was a forgery towards
the close of the third century by some zealous believer, who, observing
that there had been appeals made by the Christians of the former age,
to the acts of Pilate,  but that such acts could not be produced,
imagined it would be of service to Christianity to fabricate and publish
this Gospel; as it would both confirm the Christians under persecution,
and convince the Heathens of the truth of the Christian religion. The
Rev. Jeremiah Jones says, that such pious frauds were very common among
Christians even in the first three centuries; and that a forgery of this
nature, with the view above-mentioned, seems natural and probable. The
same author, in noticing that Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History,
charges the Pagans with having forged and published a book,  called "The
Acts of Pilate," takes occasion to observe that the internal evidence of
this Gospel shows it was not the work of any Heathen, but that if in the
latter end of the third century we find it in use among Christians (as
it was then certainly in some churches), and about the same time find a
forgery of the Heathens under the same title, it seems exceedingly
probable that some Christians, at that time, should publish such a piece
as this, in order partly to confront the spurious one of the Pagans, and
partly to support those appeals which had been made by former Christians
to the Acts of Pilate; and Mr. Jones says, he thinks so more particularly
as we have innumerable instances of forgeries by the faithful in the
primitive ages, grounded on less plausible reasons. Whether it be
canonical or not, it is of very great antiquity, and is appealed to by
several of the ancient Christians. The present translation is made from
the Gospel, published by Grynaeus in the Orthodoxographa, vol. i,  tom,
ii, p. 613.]

Notwithstanding the diversity of opinions here alluded to, the majority
of the learned believe that the internal evidence of the authenticity of
this Gospel is manifested in the correct details of that period of
Christ's life on which it treats, while it far excels the canonical
Evangelists narrative of the trial of our Saviour before Pilate, with
more minute particulars of persons, evidence, circumstance, &c.


                            THE EPISTLES OF
                 JESUS CHRIST & ABGARUS KING OF EDESSA.


CHAPTER I.

     A copy of a letter written by King Abgarus to Jesus;
     and sent to him by Ananius, his footman, to Jerusalem,
     5 inviting him to Edessa.

ABGARUS, king of Edessa, to
Jesus the good Saviour, who
appears at Jerusalem, greeting.

2  I have been informed concerning
you and your cures, which are
performed without the use of
medicines and herbs.

3  For it is reported, that you
cause the blind to see, the lame to
walk, do both cleanse lepers, and
cast out unclean spirits and devils,
and restore them to health who have
been long diseased; and raiseth up
the dead;

4  All which when I heard, I was
persuaded of one of these two,
namely, either that you are God
himself descended from heaven;
who do these things, or the Son
of God.

5  On this account therefore I
have written to you, earnestly to
desire you would take the trouble
of a journey hither, and cure a
disease which I am under.

6  For I hear the Jews ridicule
you and, intend you mischief.

7  My city is indeed small, but
neat, and large enough for us
both.


CHAPTER II.

     The answer of Jesus by Ananias the footman
     to Abgarus the king,
     3 declining to visit Edessa.

ABGARUS, you are happy,
forasmuch as you have
believed on me, whom you
have not seen.

2  For it is written concerning
me, that those who have seen me
should not believe on me, that
they who have not seen might
believe and live.

3  As to that part of your letter,
which relates to my giving you a
visit, I must inform you, that I
must fulfil all the ends of my
mission in this country, and after
that be received up again to him
who sent me.

4  But after my ascension I will
send one of my disciples, who will
cure your disease, and give life to
you, and all that are with you.


            REFERENCES TO THE EPISTLES OF JESUS CHRIST AND
                        ABGARUS KING OF EDESSA.

[The first writer who makes any mention of the Epistles that passed
between Jesus Christ and Abgarus, is Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, in
Palestine, who flourished in the early part of the fourth century. For
their genuineness, he appeals to the public registers and records of the
City of Edessa in Mesopotamia, where Abgarus reigned, and where he
affirms that he found them written in the Syriac language. He published a
Greek translation of them, in his Ecclesiastical History. The learned
world has been much divided on this subject; but, notwithstanding the
erudite Grabe, with Archbishop Cave, Dr, Parker, and other divines, have
strenuously contended for their admission into the canon of Scripture,
they are deemed apocryphal. The Rev. Jeremiah Jones observes, that the
common people in England have this Epistle in their houses in many
places, fixed in a frame, with the picture of Christ before it; and that
they generally, with much honesty and devotion, regard it as the word of
God, and the genuine Epistle of Christ.]


                             THE EPISTLE OF
                ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE LAODICEANS.

     1 He salutes the brethren;
     3 exhorts them to persevere in good works,
     4 and not to be moved by vain speaking.
     6 Rejoices in his bonds,
     10 desires them to live in the fear of the Lord.

PAUL an Apostle, not of men,
neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ, to the brethren which are
at Laodicea.

2  Grace be to you, and peace
from God the Father and our Lord
Jesus Christ.

3  I thank Christ in every prayer
of mine, that ye may continue and
persevere in good works, looking
for that which is promised in the
day of judgment.

4  Let not the vain speeches of
any trouble you, who pervert the
truth, that they may draw you
aside from the truth of the Gospel
which I have preached.

5  And now may God grant, that
my converts may attain to a
perfect knowledge of the truth
of the Gospel, be beneficent,
and doing good works which
accompany salvation.

6  And now my bonds, which I
suffer in Christ, are manifest,
in which I rejoice and am glad.
For I know that this shall
turn to my salvation for ever,
which shall be through your
prayer, and the supply of the
Holy Spirit.

8  Whether I live or die, to live
shall be a life to Christ, to die
will be joy.

9  And our Lord will grant us
his mercy, that ye may have the
same love, and be like-minded.

10  Wherefore, my beloved, as
ye have heard of the coming of
the Lord, so think and act in fear,
and it shall be to you life eternal;

11  For it is God, who worketh
in you:

12  And do all things without
sin.

13  And what is best, my beloved
rejoice in the Lord Jesus Christ
and avoid all filthy lucre.

14  Let all your requests be made
known to God, and be steady in
the doctrine of Christ.

15  And whatsoever things are
sound and true, and of good report,
and chaste, and just, and lovely,
these things do.

16  Those things which ye have
heard, and received, think on these
things, and peace shall be with
you.

17  All the saints salute you.

18  The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

19  Cause this Epistle to be read
to the Colossians, and the Epistle
of the Colossians to be read among
you.

[This Epistle has been highly esteemed by several learned men of the
church of Rome and others. The Quakers have printed a translation, and
plead for it,  as the reader may see, by consulting Poole's Annotation on
Col. vi. 16. Sixtus Senensis mentions two MSS., the one in the Sorbonne

                            THE EPISTLES OF
                 ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO SENECA, WITH
                           SENECA'S TO PAUL.

CHAPTER I.

ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

I SUPPOSE, Paul, you have been
informed of that conversation,
which passed yesterday between
me and my Lucilius, concerning
hypocrisy and other subjects; for
there were some of your disciples
in company with us;

2  For when we were retired into
the Sallustian gardens, through
which they were also passing, and
would have gone another way, by
our persuasion they joined
company with us.

3  I desire you to believe, that
we much wish for your conversation;

4  We were much delighted with
your book of many Epistles, which
you have written to some cities
and chief towns of provinces, and
contain wonderful instructions for
moral conduct:

5  Such sentiments, as I suppose
you were not the author of, but
only the instrument of conveying,
though sometimes both the author
and the instrument,

6  For such is the sublimity of
those, doctrines, and their grandeur,
that I suppose the age of a man
is scarce sufficient to be instructed
and perfected in the knowledge of
them. I wish your welfare, my brother.
Farewell.


CHAPTER II.

PAUL to SENECA Greeting.

I RECEIVED your letter yesterday
with pleasure, to which I could
immediately have written an answer,
had the young man been at home,
whom I intended to have sent to you:

2  For you know when, and by whom,
at what seasons, and to whom I must
deliver everything which I send.

3  I desire therefore you would
not charge me with negligence, if
I wait for a proper person.

4  I reckon myself very happy in
having the judgment of so valuable
a person, that you are delighted
with my Epistles:

5  For you would not be esteemed
a censor, a philosopher, or be the
tutor of so great a prince, and a
master of everything, if you were
not sincere.   I wish you a lasting
prosperity.


CHAPTER III.

ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

I HAVE completed some volumes
and divided them into their
proper parts.

2  I am determined to read them
to Caesar, and if any favourable
opportunity happens, you also
shall be present, when they are
read;

3  But if that cannot be, I will
appoint and give you notice of a
day, when we will together read
over the performance.

4 I had determined, if I could
with safety, first to have your
opinion of it, before I published
it to Caesar, that you might be
convinced of my affection to you.
Farewell, dearest Paul.


CHAP. IV.
PAUL to SENECA Greeting.

AS often as I read your letters,
I imagine you present with
me; nor indeed do I think any
other, than that you are always
with us.

2  As soon therefore as you begin
to come, we shall presently see
each other. I wish you all
prosperity.


CHAPTER V.

ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

WE are very much concerned
at your too long absence
from us.

2  What is it, or what affairs are
they, which obstructs your coming?

3  If you fear the anger of
Caesar because you have abandoned
your former religion, and made
proselytes also of others, you
have this to plead, that your
acting thus proceeded not from
inconstancy, but judgment.
Farewell.


CHAPTER VI.

PAUL to SENECA and LUCILIUS
Greeting.

CONCERNING those things,
about which ye wrote to me,
it is not proper for me to mention
anything in writing with pen and
ink: the one of which leaves
marks, and the other evidently
declares things.

2  Especially since I know that
there are near you, as well as me,
those who will understand my
meaning.

3  Deference is to be paid to
all men, and so much the more,
as they are more likely to take
occasions of quarrelling.

4  And if we show a submissive
temper, we shall overcome
effectually in all points, if so
be they are, who are capable of
seeing and acknowledging themselves
to have been in the wrong. Farewell.


CHAPTER VII.

ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

I PROFESS myself extremely
pleased with the reading your
letters to the Galatians,
Corinthians, and people of Achaia.

2  For the Holy Ghost has in
them by you delivered those
sentiments which are very lofty,
sublime, deserving of all respect,
and beyond your own invention.

3  I could wish therefore, that
when you are writing things so
extraordinary, there might not
be wanting an elegancy of speech
agreeable to their majesty.

4  And I must own, my brother,
that I may not at once dishonestly
conceal anything from you, and be
unfaithful to my own conscience,
that the emperor is extremely
pleased with the sentiments of
your Epistles;

5  For when he heard the beginning
of them read, he declared, that he
was surprised to find such notions
in a person, who had not had a
regular education.

6  To which I replied, That the
Gods sometimes made use of mean
(innocent) persons to speak by, and
gave him an instance of this in a
mean countryman named Vatienus,
who, when he was in the country
of Reate, had two men appeared
to him, called Castor and Pollux,
and received a revelation from the
gods. Farewell.


CHAPTER VIII.

PAUL to SENECA Greeting.

ALTHOUGH I know the emperor is
both an admirer and favourer of
our religion, yet give me leave
to advise you against your suffering
any injury (by showing favour to us).

2  I think indeed you ventured
upon a very dangerous attempt,
when you would declare (to the
emperor) that which is so very
contrary to his religion, and way
of worship; seeing he is a
worshipper of the heathen gods.

3  I know not what you particularly
had in view, when you told him of
this; but I suppose you did it out
of too great respect for me.

4  But I desire that for the future
you would not do so; for you had
need be careful, lest by showing
your affection for me, you should
offend your master:

5  His anger indeed will do us no
harm, if he continue a heathen;
nor will his not being angry be
of any service to us:

6  And if the empress act worthy
of her character, she will not be
angry; but if she act as a woman,
she will be affronted. Farewell.


CHAPTER IX.

ANNEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

KNOW that my letter, wherein
I acquainted you, that I had
read to the Emperor your Epistles,
does not so much affect you as the
nature of the things (contained
in them.)

2  Which do so powerfully divert
men's minds from their former
manners and practices, that I have
always been surprised, and have
been fully convinced of it by many
arguments heretofore.

3  Let us therefore begin afresh;
and if any thing heretofore has
been imprudently acted, do you
forgive.

4  I have sent you a book decopia
verborum. Farewell, dearest Paul.


CHAPTER X.

PAUL to SENECA Greeting.

AS often as I write to you,
and place my name before yours,
I do a thing both disagreeable
to myself, and contrary to our
religion:

2  For I ought, as I have often
declared, to become all things to
all men, and to have that regard
to your quality, which the Roman
law has honoured all senators with;
namely, to put my name last in the
(inscription of the) Epistle, that
I may not at length with uneasiness
and shame be obliged to do that
which it was always my inclination
to do. Farewell, most respected
master. Dated the fifth of the
calends of July, in the fourth
Consulship of Nero, and Messala.


CHAPTER XI.

ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

ALL happiness to you,
my dearest Paul.

2  If a person so great, and
every way agreeable as you are,
become not only a common, but
a most intimate friend to me,
how happy will be the case of
Seneca!

3  You therefore, who are so
eminent, and so far exalted above
all, even the greatest, do not think
yourself unfit to be first named in
the inscription of an Epistle;

4  Lest I should suspect you intend
not so much to try me, as to banter
me; for you know yourself to be a
Roman citizen.

5  And I could wish to be in that
circumstance or station which you
are, and that you were in the same
that I am. Farewell, dearest Paul.
Dated the tenth of the calends of
April, in the Consulship of Aprianus
and Capito.


CHAPTER XII.

ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

ALL happiness to you, my dearest
Paul. Do you not suppose I am
extremely concerned and grieved
that your innocence should bring
you into sufferings?

2  And that all the people should
suppose you (Christians) so criminal,
and imagine all the misfortunes
that happen to the city, to be
caused by you?

3  But let us bear the charge
with a patient temper, appealing
for our innocence to the court
above, which is the only one our
hard fortune will allow us to address
to, till at length our misfortunes
shall end in unalterable happiness.

4  Former ages have produced
(tyrants) Alexander the son of
Philip, and Dionysius; ours also
has produced Caius Caesar; whose
inclinations were their only laws.

5  As to the frequent burnings
of the city of Rome, the cause is
manifest; and if a person in my
mean circumstances might be allowed
to speak, and one might declare
these dark things without danger,
every one should see the whole of
the matter.

6  The Christians and Jews are
indeed commonly punished for the
crime of burning the city; but that
impious miscreant, who delights
in murders and butcheries, and
disguises his villainies with lies,
is appointed to, or reserved till,
his proper time.

7  And as the life of every
excellent person is now sacrificed
instead of that one person (who is
the author of the mischief), so this
one shall be sacrificed for many,
and he shall be devoted to be burnt
with fire instead of all.

8  One hundred and thirty-two houses,
and four whole squares (or islands)
were burnt down in six days: the
seventh put an end to the burning.
I wish you all happiness.

9 Dated the fifth of the calends
of April, in the Consulship of
Frigius and Bassus.


CHAPTER XIII.

ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.

ALL happiness to you, my dearest
Paul.

2  You have written many volumes in
an allegorical and mystical style,
and therefore such mighty matters
and business being committed to you,
require not to be set off with any
rhetorical flourishes of speech,
but only with some proper elegance.

3  I remember you often said,
that many by affecting such a style
do injury to their subjects, and
lose the force of the matters they
treat of.

4  But in this I desire you to
regard me, namely, to have respect
to true Latin, and to choose just
words, that so you may the better
manage the noble trust which is
reposed in you.

5  Farewell. Dated the fifth of
the nones of July, Leo and Savinus
Consuls.


CHAPTER XIV.

PAUL to SENECA Greeting.

YOUR serious consideration is
requited with those discoveries,
which the Divine Being has
granted but to few;

2  I am thereby assured that
I sow the most strong seed in a
fertile soil, not anything material,
which is subject to corruption, but
the durable word of God, which
shall increase and bring forth fruit
to eternity.

3  That which by your wisdom you
have attained to, shall abide
without decay for ever.

4  Believe that you ought to
avoid the superstitions of Jews
and Gentiles.

5  The things which you have in
some measure arrived to, prudently
make known to the emperor, his
family, and to faithful friends;

6  And though your sentiments
will seem disagreeable, and not
be comprehended by them, seeing
most of them will not regard your
discourses, yet the Word of God
once infused into them, will at
length make them become new men,
aspiring towards God.

7  Farewell Seneca, who art
most dear to us. Dated on the
calends of August, in the
Consulship of Leo and Savinus.


          REFERENCES TO THE EPISTLES OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE
                   TO SENECA, WITH SENECA'S TO PAUL.

[Several very learned writers have entertained a favourable opinion of
these Epistles. They are undoubtedly of high antiquity. Salmeron cites
them to prove that Seneca was one of Caesar's household, referred to by
Paul, Philip iv. 22, as saluting the brethren at Philippi. In Jerome's
enumeration of illustrious men, he places Seneca, on account of these
Epistles, amongst the ecclesiastical and holy writers of the Christian
Church. Sixtus Senensis has published them in his Bibliotheque, p 89, 90;
and it is from thence that the present translation is made. Baronius,
Bellarmine, Dr. Cave, Spanheim, and others, contend that they are not
genuine.]


                     THE ACTS OF ST. PAUL AND THECLA.

     The martyrdom of the holy and glorious
     first Martyr and Apostle Thecla.


CHAPTER I.

     1 Demas and Hermogenes become Paul's companions.
     4 Paul visits Onesiphorus.
     8 Invited by Demos and Hermogenes.
     11 Preaches to the household of Onesiphorus.
     12 His sermon.

WHEN Paul went up to Iconium,
after his flight from Antioch,
Demas and Hermogenes became
his companions, who were then
full of hypocrisy.

2  But Paul looking only at the
goodness of God, did them no
harm, but loved them greatly.

3  Accordingly he endeavoured
to make agreeable to them all the
oracles and doctrines of Christ,
and the design of the Gospel of
God's well-beloved son; instructing
them in the knowledge of Christ,
as it was revealed to him.

4  And a certain man named
Onesiphorus, hearing that Paul
was come to Iconium, went out
speedily to meet him, together
with his wife Lectra, and his sons
Simmia and Zeno, to invite him to
their house.

5  For Titus had given them a
description of Paul's personage,
they as yet not knowing him in
person, but only being acquainted
with his character.

6  They went in the king's highway
to Lystra, and stood there waiting
for him, comparing all who passed
by with that description which
Titus had given them.

7  At length they saw a man coming
(namely Paul), of a low stature,
bald on the head; with crooked thighs,
handsome legs, hollow-eyes; and a
crooked nose; full of grace, for
sometimes he appeared as a man,
sometimes he had the countenance
of an angel. And Paul saw Onesiphorus,
and was glad.

8  And Onesiphorus said:
Hail, thou servant of the blessed
God. Paul replied, The grace of
God be with thee and thy family.

9  But Denies and Hermogenes
were moved with envy, and, under
a show of great religion, Demas
said, And are not we also servants
of the blessed God? Why didst
thou not salute us?

10  Onesiphorus replied, Because
I have not perceived in you the
fruits of righteousness; nevertheless,
if ye are of that sort, ye shall be
welcome to my house also.

11  Then Paul went into the house
of Onesiphorus, and there was great
joy among the family on that account:
and they employed themselves in prayer,
breaking of bread, and hearing Paul
preach the word of God concerning
temperance and the resurrection,
in the following manner:

12  Blessed are the pure in
heart; for they shall see God.

13  Blessed are they who keep
their flesh undefiled (or pure);
for they shall be the temple of God.

14  Blessed are the temperate
(or chaste); for God will reveal
himself to them.

15  Blessed are they who abandon
their worldly enjoyments; for they
shall be accepted of God.

16  Blessed are they who have
wives, as though they had them
not; for they shall be made angels
of God.

17  Blessed are they who tremble
at the word of God; for they
shall be comforted.

18  Blessed are they who keep
their baptism pure; for they shall
find peace with the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost.

19  Blessed are they who pursue
the wisdom or doctrine of Jesus
Christ; for they shall be called
the sons of the Most High.

20  Blessed are they who observe
the instructions of Jesus Christ;
for they shall dwell in eternal
light.

21  Blessed are they, who for the
love of Christ abandon the glories
of the world, for they shall judge
angels, and be placed at the right
hand of Christ, and shall not suffer
the bitterness of the last judgment.

22  Blessed are the bodies and souls
of virgins; for they are acceptable
to God, and shall not lose the reward
of their virginity; for the word of
their (heavenly) Father shall prove
effectual to their salvation in the
day of his Son, and they shall enjoy
rest for evermore.


CHAPTER II.

     1 Thecla listens anxiously to Paul's preaching.
     5 Thamyris, her admirer, concerts with Theoclia
     her mother to dissuade her,
     12 in vain.
     14 Demas and Hermogenes vilify Paul to Thamyris.

WHILE Paul was preaching
this sermon in the church
which was in the house of
Onesiphorus, a certain virgin
named Thecla (whose mother's
name was Theoclia, and who was
betrothed to a man named Thamyris)
sat at a certain window in her house.

2  From whence, by the advantage
of a window in the house where
Paul was, she both night and day
heard Paul's sermons concerning
God, concerning charity, concerning
faith in Christ, and concerning
prayer;

3  Nor would she depart from
the window, till with exceeding
joy she was subdued to the
doctrines of faith.

4  At length, when she saw many
women and virgins going into
Paul, she earnestly desired that
she might be thought worthy to
appear in his presence, and hear
the word of Christ; for she had
not yet seen Paul's person, but only
heard his sermons, and that alone.

5  But when she would not be
prevailed upon to depart from the
window, her mother sent to Thamyris,
who came with the greatest pleasure,
as hoping now, to marry her.
Accordingly he said to Theoclia,
Where is my Thecla?

6  Theoclia replied, Thamyris,
I have something very strange to
tell you; for Thecla, for the space
of three days, will not move from
the window, not so much as to eat
or drink, but is so intent in
hearing the artful and delusive
discourses of a certain foreigner,
that I perfectly wonder Thamyris,
that a young woman of her known
modesty, will suffer herself to be
so prevailed upon.

7  For that man has disturbed
the whole city of Iconium, and
even your Thecla, among others.
All the women and young men
flock to him to receive his
doctrine; who, besides all the
rest, tells them that there is
but one God, who alone is to be
worshipped, and that we ought
to live in chastity.

8  Notwithstanding this, my
daughter Thecla, like a spider's
web fastened to the window, is
captivated, by the discourses of
Paul, and attends' upon them with
prodigious eagerness, and vast
delight; and thus, by attending
on what he says, the young woman
is seduced.    Now then do you go,
and speak to her, for she is
betrothed to you.

9  Accordingly Thamyris went,
and having saluted her, and taking
care not to surprise her, he said,
Thecla, my spouse, why sittest
thou in this melancholy posture?
What strange impressions are
made upon thee? Turn to Thamyris,
and blush.

10  Her mother also spake to her
after the same manner, and said,
Child, why dost thou sit so
melancholy, and, like one
astonished, makest no reply?

11  Then they wept exceedingly,
Thamyris, that he had lost his
spouse; Theoclia, that she had
lost her daughter; and the maids,
that they had lost their mistress;
and there was an universal
mourning in the family.

12  But all these things made no
impression upon Thecla, so as to
incline her so much as to turn to
them, and take notice of them;
for she still regarded the
discourses of Paul.

13  Then Thamyris ran forth into
the street to observe who they
were that went in to Paul, and
came out from him; and he saw
two men engaged in a very warm
dispute, and said to them;

14  Sirs, what business have
you here? and who is that man
within, belonging to you, who
deludes the minds of men, both
young men and virgins, persuading
them, that they ought not to marry,
but continue as they are?

15  I promise to give you a
considerable sum, if ye will give
me a just account of him; for I am
the chief person of this city.

16  Demas and Hermogenes replied,
We cannot so exactly tell who he
is; but this we know, that he
deprives young men of their
(intended) wives, and virgins of
their (intended) husbands, by
teaching, There can be no future
resurrection, unless ye continue
in chastity, and do not defile your
flesh.


CHAPTER III.

1 They betray Paul.
7 Thamyris arrests him with officers.

THEN said Thamyris, Come along
with me to my house, and refresh
yourselves. So they went to a very
splendid entertainment, where
there was wine in abundance,
and very rich provision.

2  They were brought to a table
richly spread, and made to drink
plentifully by Thamyris, on account
of the love he had for Thecla
and his desire to marry her.

3  Then Thamyris said, I desire
ye would inform me what the
doctrines of this Paul are, that
I may understand them; for I am
under no small concern about Thecla,
seeing she so delights in that
stranger's discourses, that I am in
danger of losing my intended wife.

4  Then Demas and Hermogenes
answered both together, and said,
Let him be brought before the
governor Castellius, as one who
endeavours to persuade the people
into the new religion of the
Christians, and he, according to
the order of Caesar, will put him
to death, by which means you will
obtain your wife;

5  While we at the same time will
teach her, that the resurrection
which he speaks of is already come,
and consists in our having children;
and that we then arose again,
when we came to the knowledge of God.

6  Thamyris having this account
from them, was filled with hot
resentment:

7  And rising early in the morning
he went to the house of Onesiphorus,
attended by the magistrates, the
Jailor, and a great multitude of
people with staves, and said to Paul;

8  Thou hast perverted the city
of Iconium, and among the rest,
Thecla, who is betrothed to me,
so that now she will not marry
me. Thou shalt therefore go with
us to the governor Castellius.

9  And all the multitude cried
out, Away with this imposter, for
he has perverted the minds of our
wives, and all the people hearken
to him.


CHAPTER IV.

     1 Paul accused before the governor by Thamyris.
     5 Defends himself.
     9 Is committed to prison,
     10 and visited by Thecla.

THEN Thamyris standing before
the governor's judgment-seat,
spake with a loud voice in the
following manner.

2 O governor, I know not whence
this man cometh; but he is one
who teaches that matrimony is
unlawful. Command him therefore
to declare before you for what
reason he publishes such doctrines.

3  While he was saying thus,
Demas and Hermogenes (whispered to
Thamyris, and) said; Say that he
is a Christian, and he will
presently be put to death.

4  But the governor was more
deliberate, and calling to Paul,
he said, Who art thou? What dost
thou teach? They seem to lay
gross crimes to thy charge.

5  Paul then spake with a loud
voice, saying, As I am now called
to give an account, O governor,
of my doctrines, I desire your
audience.

6  That God, who is a God of
vengeance, and who strands in need
of nothing but the salvation of his
creatures, has sent me to reclaim
them from their wickedness, and
corruptions; from all (sinful)
pleasures, and from death; and to
persuade them to sin no more.

7  On this account, God sent his
Son Jesus Christ, whom I preach,
and in whom I instruct men to
place their hopes, as that person
who only had such compassion on
the deluded world, that it might
not, O governor, be condemned,
but have faith, the fear of God,
the knowledge of religion, and the
love of truth.

8  So that if I only teach those
things which I have received by
revelation from God, where is my
crime?

9  When the governor heard this,
he ordered Paul to be bound,
and to be put in prison, till he
should be more at leisure to hear
him more fully.

10  But in the night, Thecla
taking off her ear-rings, gave them
to the turnkey of the prison, who
then opened the door to her, and
let her in;

11  And when she made a present
of a silver looking-glass to the
jailor, was allowed to go into the
room where Paul was; then she set
down at his feet, and heard from
him the great things of God.

12  And as she perceived Paul
not to be afraid of suffering,
but that by divine assistance
he behaved himself with courage,
her faith so far increased that
she kissed his chains.


CHAPTER V.

1 Thecla sought and found by her relations.
4 Brought with Paul before the governor.
9 Ordered to be burnt, and Paul to be whipt.
15 Thecla miraculously saved.

AT length Thecla was missed
and sought for by the family
and by Thamyris in every street,
as though she had been lost; till
one of the porter's fellow-servants
told them, that she had gone out
in the night-time.

2  Then they examined the porter,
and he told them, that she was
gone to the prison to the strange
man.

3  They went therefore according
to his direction, and there found
her; and when they came out, they
got a mob together, and went and
told the governor all that had
happened.

4  Upon which he ordered Paul
to be brought before his judgment
seat.

5  Thecla in the mean time lay
wallowing on the ground in the
prison, in that same place where
Paul had sat to teach her; upon
which the governor also ordered
her to be brought before his
judgment-seat; which summons she
received with joy, and went.

6  When Paul was brought thither,
the mob with more vehemence cried
out, He is a magician, let him die.

7  Nevertheless the governor
attended with pleasure upon Paul's
discourses of the holy works of
Christ; and, after a council called,
he summoned Thecla, and said to
her, Why do you not, according
to the law of the Iconians, marry
Thamyris?

8  She stood still, with her eyes
fixed upon Paul; and finding she
made no reply, Theoclia, her
mother cried out saying, Let the
unjust creature be burnt; let her
be burnt in the midst of the theatre,
for refusing Thamyris, that all
women may learn from her to avoid
such practices.

9  Then the governor was exceedingly
concerned, and ordered Paul to be
whipt out of the city, and Thecla
to be burnt.

10  So the governor arose, and went
immediately into the theatre; and
all the people went forth to see
the dismal sight.

11  But Thecla, just as a lamb in
the wilderness looks every way to
see his shepherd, looked around
for Paul;

12  And as she was looking upon
the multitude, she saw the Lord
Jesus in the likeness of Paul, and
said to herself, Paul is come to see
me in my distressed circumstances.
And she fixed her eyes upon him;
but he instantly ascended up to
heaven, while she looked on him.

13  Then the young men and women
brought wood and straw for the
burning of Thecla; who being brought
naked to the stake, extorted tears
from the governor, with surprise
beholding the greatness of her beauty.

14  And when they had placed
the wood in order, the people
commanded her to go upon it; which
she did, first making the sign of
the cross.

15  Then the people set fire to
the pile; though the flame was
exceeding large, it did not touch
her; for God took compassion on
her, and caused a great eruption
from the earth beneath, and a
cloud from above to pour down
great quantities of rain and hail;

16  Insomuch that by the rupture
of the earth, very many were
in great danger, and some were
killed, the fire was extinguished,
and Thecla preserved.


CHAPTER VI.

1 Paul with Onesiphorus in a cave.
7 Thecla discovers Paul;
12 proffers to follow him:
13 he exhorts her not for fear of fornication.

IN the mean time Paul, together
with Onesiphorus, his wife and
children, was keeping a fast in a
certain cave, which was in the
road from Iconium to Daphne.

2  And when they had fasted for
several days, the children said to
Paul, Father, we are hungry, and
have not wherewithal to buy bread;
for Onesiphorus had left all his
substance to follow Paul with his
family.

3  Then Paul, taking off his coat,
said to the boy, Go, child, and buy
bread, and bring it hither.

4  But while the boy was buying
the bread, he saw his neighbour
Thecla, and was surprised, and
said to her, Thecla, where are you
going?

5  She replied, I am in pursuit
of Paul, having been delivered
from the flames.

6  The boy then said, I will bring
you to him, for he is under great
concern on your account, and has
been in prayer and fasting these
six days.

7  When Thecla came to the cave,
she found Paul upon his knees
praying and saying, O holy Father,
O Lord Jesus Christ, grant that
the fire may not touch Thecla;
but be her helper, for she is
thy servant.

8  Thecla then standing behind
him, cried out in the following
words: O sovereign Lord Creator
of heaven and earth, the Father of
thy beloved and holy Son, I praise
thee that thou hast preserved me
from the fire, to see Paul again.

9  Paul then arose, and when he
saw her, said, O God, who searchest
the heart, Father of my Lord Jesus
Christ, I praise thee that thou hast
answered my prayer.

10  And there prevailed among them
in the cave an entire affection to
each other; Paul, Onesiphorus,
and all that were with them being
filled with joy.

11  They had five loaves, some
herbs and water, and they solaced
each other in reflections upon the
holy works of Christ.

12  Then said Thecla to Paul,
If you be pleased with it, I will
follow you whithersoever you go.

13  He replied to her, Persons
are now much given to fornication,
and you being handsome, I am
afraid lest you should meet with
greater temptation than the former,
and should Not withstand, but be
overcome by it.

14  Thecla replied, Grant me
only the seal of Christ, and no
temptation shall affect me.

15  Paul answered, Thecla, wait
with patience, and you shall
receive the gift of Christ.


CHAPTER VII.

     1 Paul and Thecla go to Antioch.
     2 Alexander, a magistrate, falls in love with Thecla:
     4 kisses her by force:
     5 she resists him:
     6 is carried before the governor, and condemned
     to be thrown to wild beasts.

THEN Paul sent back Onesiphorus
and his family to their own home,
and taking Thecla along with him,
went for Antioch;

2  And as soon as they came in.
to the city, a certain Syrian,
named Alexander, a magistrate in
the city, who had done many
considerable services for the city
during his magistracy, saw Thecla,
and fell in love with her, and
endeavoured by many rich presents
to engage Paul in his interest.

3  But Paul told him, I know not
the woman of whom you speak, nor
does she belong to me.

4  But he being a person of great
power in, Antioch, seized her in
the street and kissed her: which
Thecla would not bear, but looking
about for Paul, cried out in a
distressed loud tone, Force me not,
who am a stranger; force me not,
who am a servant of God; I am
one of the principal persons of
Iconium, and was obliged to leave
that city because I would not be
married to Thamyris.

5  Then she laid hold on Alexander,
tore his coat, and took his crown
off his head, and made him appear
ridiculous before all the people.

6 But Alexander, partly as he
loved her, and partly being ashamed
of what had been done, led her to
the governor, and upon her confession
of what she had done, he condemned
her to be thrown among the beasts.


CHAPTER VIII.

     2 Thecla entertained by Trifina;
     3 brought out to the wild beasts;
     a she-lion licks her feet.
     5 Trifina upon a vision of her deceased
     daughter, adopts Thecla,
     11 who is taken to the amphitheatre again.

WHICH when the people saw, they
said: The judgments passed in this
city are unjust. But Thecla desired
the favour of the governor, that
her chastity might not be attacked,
but preserved till she should be
cast to the beasts.

2  The governor then inquired,
Who would entertain her; upon
which a certain very rich widow,
named Trifina, whose daughter
was lately dead, desired that she
might have the keeping of her;
and she began to treat her in her
house as her own daughter.

3  At length a day came, when
the beasts were to be brought forth
to be seen; and Thecla was brought
to the amphitheatre, and put into
a den in which was an exceeding
fierce she-lion, in the presence of
a multitude of spectators.

4  Trifina; without any surprise,
accompanied Thecla, and the
she-lion licked the feet of Thecla.
The title written which denoted
her crime, was Sacrilege. Then
the women cried out, O God, the
judgments of this city are
unrighteous.

5  After the beasts had been
shown, Trifina took Thecla home
with her, and they went to bed;
and behold, the daughter of Trifina,
who was dead, appeared to her
mother, and said; Mother, let the
young woman, Thecla, be reputed
by you as your daughter in my
stead; and desire her that she
should pray for me, that I may be
translated to a state of happiness.

6  Upon which Trifina, with a
mournful air, said, My daughter
Falconilla has appeared to me, and
ordered me to receive you in her
room; wherefore I desire, Thecla,
that you would pray for my daughter,
that she may be translated into
a state of happiness, and to life
eternal.

7  When Thecla heard this, she
immediately prayed to the Lord,
and said: O Lord God of heaven and
earth, Jesus Christ, thou Son of
the Most High, grant that her
daughter Falconilla may live forever.
Trifina hearing this, groaned again,
and said: O unrighteous judgments!
O unreasonable wickedness! that
such a creature should (again)
be cast to the beasts!

8  On the morrow, at break of day,
Alexander came to Trifina's house,
and said: The governor and the
people are waiting; bring the
criminal forth.

9  But Trifina ran in so violently
upon him, that he was affrighted,
and ran away. Trifina was one of
the royal family; and she thus
expressed her sorrow, and said;
Alas! I have trouble in my house
on two accounts, and there is no
one who will relieve me, either
under the loss of my daughter, or
my being unable to save Thecla.
But now, O Lord God, be thou the
helper of Thecla thy servant.

10  While she was thus engaged.
the governor sent one of his own
officers to bring Thecla. Trifina
took her by the hand, and, going
with her, said: I went with
Falconilla to her grave, and now
must go with Thecla to the beasts.

11  When Thecla heard this, she
weeping prayed, and said: O Lord
God, whom I have made my confidence
and refuge, reward Trifina for her
compassion to me, and preserving
my chastity.

12  Upon this there was a great
noise in the amphitheatre; the
beasts roared, and the people
cried out, Bring in the criminal.

13  But the women cried out,
and said: Let the whole city
suffer for such crimes; and
order all of us, O governor,
to the same punishment. O unjust
judgment! O cruel sight!

14  Others said, Let the whole
city be destroyed for this vile
action. Kill us all, O governor.
O cruel sight! O unrighteous
judgment.


CHAPTER IX.

     1 Thecla thrown naked to the wild beasts;
     2 but they all refuse to attack her.
     8 She baptizes herself in a pit of water.
     10 Other wild beasts refuse to injure her.
     11 Tied to wild bulls.
     13 Miraculously saved.
     21. Released.
     24 Entertained by Trifina,

THEN Thecla was taken out of
the hand of Trifina, stripped
naked, had a girdle put on, and
thrown into the place appointed
for fighting with the beasts: and
the lions and the bears were let
loose upon her.

2  But a she-lion, which was of
all the most fierce, ran to Thecla,
and fell down at her feet. Upon
which the multitude of women
shouted aloud.

3  Then a she-bear ran fiercely
towards her, but the she lion met
the bear, and tore it in pieces.

4  Again a he-lion, who had been
wont to devour men, and which
belonged to Alexander, ran towards
her; but the she-lion encountered
the he-lion, and they killed each
other.

5  Then the women were under
a greater concern, because the
she-lion, which had helped Thecla,
was dead.

6  Afterwards they brought out
many other wild beasts; but Thecla
stood with her hands stretched
towards heaven, and prayed; and
when she had done praying, she
turned about, and saw a pit of
water, and said, Now it is a proper
time for me to be baptized.

7  Accordingly she threw herself
into the water, and said, In thy
name, O my Lord Jesus Christ, I
am this last day baptized. The
women and the people seeing this,
cried out and said, Do not throw
yourself into the water. And the
governor himself cried out, to
think that the fish (sea-calves)
were like to devour so much
beauty.

8  Notwithstanding all this,
Thecla threw herself into the water,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9  But the fish (sea-calves) when
they saw the lightning and fire,
were killed, and swam dead upon
the surface of the water, and a
cloud of fire surrounded Thecla;
so that as the beasts could not
come near her, so the people could
not see her nakedness.

10  Yet they turned other wild
beasts upon her; upon which they
made a very mournful outcry; and
some of them scattered spikenard,
others cassia, others amomus (a
sort of spikenard, or the herb of
Jerusalem, or ladies rose), others
ointment; so that the quantity of
ointment was large, in proportion
to the number of people; and upon
this all the beasts lay as though
they had been fast asleep, and did
not touch Thecla.

11  Whereupon Alexander said
to the governor, I have some very
terrible bulls; let us bind her to
them. To which the governor, with
concern, replied, You may do what
you think fit.

12  Then they put a cord round
Thecla's waist, which bound also
her feet, and with it tied her to
the bulls, to whose privy-parts they
applied red-hot irons, that so they
being the more tormented, might
more violently drag Thecla about,
till they had killed her.

13  The bulls accordingly tore
about, making a most hideous noise;
but the flame which was about Thecla,
burnt off the cords which were
fastened to the members of the
bulls, and she stood in the middle
of the stage, as unconcerned as
if she had not been bound.

14  But in the mean time Trifina,
who sat upon one of the benches,
fainted away and died; upon which
the whole city was under a very
great concern.

15  And Alexander himself was
afraid, and desired the governor,
saying: I entreat you, take
compassion on me and the city,
and release this woman, who has
fought with the beasts; lest both
you and I, and the whole city,
be destroyed;

16  For if Caesar should have any
account of what has passed now,
he will certainly immediately
destroy the city, because Trifina,
a person of royal extract, and a
relation of his, is dead upon her
seat.

17  Upon this the governor called
Thecla from among the beasts to him,
and said to her, Who art thou? and
what are thy circumstances, that not
one of the beasts will touch thee?

18  Thecla replied to him; I am
a servant of the living God; and
as to my state, I am a believer on
Jesus Christ his Son, in whom
God is well pleased; and for that
reason none of the beasts could
touch me.

19  He alone is the way to eternal
salvation, and the foundation of
eternal life. He is a refuge to
those who are in distress; a support
to the afflicted, hope and defence
to those who are hopeless; and in
a word, all those who do not
believe on him, shall not live,
but suffer eternal death.

20  When the governor heard these
things, he ordered her clothes
to be brought, and said to her,
Put on your clothes.

21  Thecla replied: May that God
who clothed me when I was naked
among the beasts, in the day of
judgment clothe your soul with
the robe of salvation. Then she
took her clothes, and put them
on; and the governor immediately
published an order in these words:
I release to you Thecla the servant
of God.

22  Upon which the women cried
out together with a loud voice,
and with one accord gave praise
unto God, and said; There is but
one God, who is the God of Thecla;
the one God who hath delivered
Thecla.

23  So loud were their voices,
that the whole city seemed to be
shaken; and Trifina herself heard
the glad tidings, and arose again,
and ran with the multitude to
meet Thecla; and embracing her,
said: Now I believe there shall
be a resurrection of the dead;
now I am persuaded that my daughter
is alive. Come therefore home
with me, my daughter Thecla, and
I will make all over that I have
to you.

24  So Thecla went with Trifina,
and was entertained there a few
days, teaching her the word of the
Lord, whereby many young women
were converted; and there was
great joy in the family of Trifina.

25  But Thecla longed to see Paul,
and inquired and sent every where
to find him; and when at length
she was informed that he was at
Myra, in Lycia, she took with her
many young men and women; and
putting on a girdle, and dressing
herself in the habit of a man,
she went to him to Myra in Lycia,
and there found Paul preaching
the word of God; and she stood
by him among the throng.


CHAPTER X.

     1 Thecla visits Paul;
     6 visits Onesiphorus;
     8 and visits her Mother
     9 who repulses her.
     14 Is tempted by the devil.
     16 Works miracles.

BUT it was no small surprise
to Paul when he saw her and the
people with her; for he imagined
some fresh trial was coming upon them;

2  Which when Thecla perceived,
she said to him: I have been baptized,
O Paul; for he who assists you in
preaching, has assisted me to baptize.

3  Then Paul took her, and led her
to the house of Hermes; and Thecla
related to Paul all that had
befallen her in Antioch, insomuch
that Paul exceedingly wondered,
and all who heard were confirmed
in the faith, and prayed for
Trifina's happiness.

4  Then Thecla arose, and said
to Paul, I am going to Iconium.
Paul replied to her: Go and teach
the word of the Lord.

5  But Trifina had sent large sums
of money to Paul, and also clothing
by the hands of Thecla, for the
relief of the poor.

6  So Thecla went to Iconium.
And when she came to the house
of Onesiphorus, she fell down upon
the floor where Paul had sat and
preached, and, mixing tears with
her prayers, she praised and
glorified God in the following
words:

7 O Lord the God of this house,
in which I was first enlightened by
thee; O Jesus, son of the living
God, who wast my helper before
the governor, my helper in the
fire, and my helper among the
beasts; thou alone art God for
ever and ever, Amen.

8  Thecla now (on her return)
found Thamyris dead, but her
mother living. So calling her
mother, she said to her: Theoclia,
my mother, is it possible for you
to be brought to a belief, that
there is but one Lord God, who
dwells in the heavens? If you
desire great riches, God will
give them to you by me; if you
want your daughter again, here
I am.

9  These and many other things
she represented to her mother,
(endeavouring) to persuade her
(to her own opinion). But her
mother Theoclia gave no credit to
the things which were said by the
martyr Thecla.

10  So that Thecla perceiving,
she discoursed to no purpose,
signing her whole body with the
sign (of the cross), left the house
and went to Daphne; and when
she came there, she went to the
cave, where she had found Paul
with Onesiphorus, and fell down
upon the ground; and wept before
God.

11  When she departed thence,
she went to Seleucia, and
enlightened many in the knowledge
of Christ.

12  And a bright cloud conducted
her in her journey.

13  And after she had arrived at
Seleucia she went-to a place out
of the city, about the distance
of a furlong, being afraid of the
inhabitants, because they were
worshippers of idols.

14  And she was lead (by the
cloud) into a mountain called
Calamon, or Rodeon. There she
abode many years, and underwent
a great many grievous temptations
of the devil, which she bore in a
becoming manner, by the assistance
which she had from Christ.

15  At length certain gentle-women
hearing of the virgin Thecla, went
to her, and were instructed by her
in the oracles of God, and many of
them abandoned this world, and led
a monastic life with her.

16  Hereby a good report was
spread everywhere of Thecla, and
she wrought several (miraculous)
cures, so that all the city and
adjacent countries brought their
sick to that mountain, and before
they came as far as the door of
the cave, they were instantly cured
of whatsoever distemper they had.

17  The unclean spirits were cast
out, making a noise; all received
their sick made whole, and glorified
God, who had bestowed such power
on the virgin Thecla;

18  Insomuch that the physicians
of Seleucia were now of no more
account, and lost all the profit
of their trade, because no one
regarded them; upon which they
were filled with envy, and began
to contrive what methods to take
with this servant of Christ.


CHAPTER XI.

     1 Thecla is attempted to be ravished,
     12 escapes by a rock opening,
     17 and closing miraculously.

THE devil then suggested bad
advice to their minds; and
being on a certain day met together
to consult, they reasoned among
each other thus: The virgin is a
priestess of the great goddess
Diana, and whatsoever she requests
from her, is granted, because she
is a virgin, and so is beloved
by all the gods.

2  Now then let us procure some
rakish fellows, and after we have
made them sufficiently drunk, and
given them a good sum of money,
let us order them to go and debauch
this virgin, promising them, if
they do it, a larger reward.

3 (For they thus concluded among
themselves, that if they be able
to debauch her, the gods will no
more regard her nor Diana cure
the sick for her).

4  They proceeded according to
this resolution, and the fellows
went to the mountain, and as fierce
as lions to the cave, knocking at
the door.

5  The holy martyr Thecla relying
upon the God in whom she believed,
opened the door, although she was
before apprised of their design,
and said to them, Young men,
what is your business?

6  They replied, Is there any
one within, whose name is Thecla?
She answered, What would you
have with her? They said, We
have a mind to lie with her.

7  The blessed Thecla answered,
Though I am a mean old woman,
I am the servant of my Lord Jesus
Christ; and though you have a
vile design against me, ye shall
not be able to accomplish it. They
replied, Is it impossible? but we
must be able to do with you what
we have a mind,

8  And while they were saying
this, they laid hold on her by main
force, and would have ravished her.
Then she with the (greatest)
mildness said to them: Young men
have patience, and see the glory
of the Lord.

9  And while they held her, she
looked up to heaven and said: O
God most reverend, to whom none
can be likened; who makest thyself
glorious over thine enemies; who
didst deliver me from the fire,
didst not give me up to Thamyris,
and didst not give me up to
Alexander: who deliveredst me
from the wild beasts; who didst
preserve me in the deep waters;
who hast everywhere been my
helper, and hast glorified thy
name in me;

10  Now also deliver me from
the hands of these wicked and
unreasonable men nor suffer them
to debauch my chastity which I
have hitherto preserved for thy
honour; for I love thee, and long
for thee, and worship thee,
O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
for evermore. Amen.

11  Then came a voice from
heaven, saying, Fear not Thecla,
my faithful servant, for I am with
thee. Look and see the place
which is opened for thee; there thy
eternal abode shall be; there thou
shalt receive the (beatific) vision.

12  The blessed Thecla observing,
saw the rock opened to as large
a degree as that a man might enter
in; she did as she was commanded,
bravely fled from the vile crew,
and went into the rock, which
instantly so closed, that there
was not any crack visible where
it had opened.

13  The men stood perfectly
astonished at so prodigious a
miracle, and had no power to detain
the servant of God; but only
catching hold of her veil (or hood),
they tore off a piece of it;

14  And even that was by the
permission of God, for the
confirmation of their faith,
who should come to see this
venerable place; and to convey
blessings to those in succeeding
ages, who should believe on our
Lord Jesus Christ from a pure heart.

15  Thus suffered that first
martyr and apostle of God, and
virgin, Thecla, who came from
Iconium at eighteen years of age;
afterwards, partly in journeys and
travels, and partly in a monastic
life in the cave, she lived seventy-
two years; so that she was ninety
years old when the Lord translated
her.

16  Thus ends her life.

17  The day which is kept sacred
to her memory, is the twenty-fourth
of September, to the glory of the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, now and for evermore. Amen.


              REFERENCES TO THE ACTS OF ST. PAUL AND THECLA.

[Tertullian says that this piece was forged by a Presbyter of Asia, who
being convicted, "confessed that he did it out of respect to Paul," and
Pope Gelasius, in his Decree against apocryphal books, inserted it among
them.  Notwithstanding this, a large part of the history was credited and
looked upon as genuine among the primitive Christians. Cyprian,
Eusebius, Epiphanius, Austin, Gregory, Nagianzen. Chrysostom, and Severus
Sulpitius, who all lived within the fourth century mention Thecla or
refer to her history.  Basil of Seleucia wrote her acts, sufferings and
victories, in verse; and Euagrius Scholasticus an ecclesiastical
historian, about 590, relates that "after the Emperor Zeno, had
abdicated his empire, and Basilik had taken possession of it, he had a
vision of the holy and excellent martyr Thecla, who promised him the
restoration of his empire; for which, when it was brought about, he
erected and dedicated a most noble and sumptuous temple to this famous
martyr, Thecla, at Seleucia, a city of Isauria, and bestowed upon it very
noble endowments, which (says the author) are preserved even till this
day." Hist. Ecel. lib. 3 cap. 8.--Cardinal Barenius, Locrinus, Archbishop
Wake, and others; and also the learned Grabe, who edited the Septuagint,
and revived the Acts of Paul and Thecla, consider them as having been
written in the Apostolic age; as containing nothing superstitious, or
disagreeing from the opinions and belief of those times; and, in short,
as a genuine and authentic history. Again, it is said, that this is not
the original book of the early Christians; but however that may be, it
is published from the Greek MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, which
Dr. Mills copied and transmitted to Dr. Grabe.]


                         THE FIRST EPISTLE OF
                      CLEMENT TO THE CORINTHIANS.


CHAPTER I.

     Clement commends them for their excellent order
     and piety in Christ, before their schism broke out.

THE Church of God which is
at Rome, to the Church of God
which is at Corinth, elect,
sanctified by the will of God,
through Jesus Christ our Lord:
grace and peace from the Almighty
God, by Jesus Christ, be multiplied
unto you.

2  Brethren, the sudden and
unexpected dangers and calamities
that have fallen upon us, have, we
fear, made us the more slow in our
consideration of those things which
you inquired of us:

3  As also of that wicked and
detestable sedition, so unbecoming
the elect of God, which a few
headstrong and self-willed men
have fomented to such a degree of
madness, that your venerable and
renowned name, so worthy of all
men to be beloved, is greatly
blasphemed thereby.

4  For who that has ever been
among you has not experienced
the firmness of your faith, and
its fruitfulness in all good works;
and admired the temper and
moderation of your religion in
Christ; and published abroad the
magnificence of your hospitality;
and thought you happy in your
perfect and certain knowledge of
the Gospel?

5  For ye did all things without
respect of persons, and walked
according to the laws of God;
being subject to those who had
the rule over you, and giving the
honour that was fitting to the aged
among you.

6  Ye commanded the young men
to think those things that were
modest and grave.

7  The women ye exhorted to do
all things with an unblameable,
and seemly, and pure conscience;
loving their own husbands, as was
fitting: and that keeping themselves
within the bounds of a due obedience,
they should order their houses
gravely, with all discretion.

8  Ye were all of you humble-
minded, not boasting of anything
desiring rather to be subject than
to govern; to give than to receive;
being a content with the portion
God hath dispensed to you:

9  And hearkening diligently to
his word, ye were enlarged in
your bowels, having his sufferings
always before your eyes.

10  Thus a firm, and blessed,
and profitable peace was given
unto you: and an unsatiable desire
of doing good; and a plentiful
effusion of the Holy Ghost was
upon all of you.

11  And being full of good
designs, ye did with, great
readiness of mind, and with
a religious confidence stretch
forth your hands to God Almighty;
beseeching him to be merciful
unto you, if in anything ye had
unwillingly sinned against him.

12  Ye contended day and night
for the whole brotherhood; that
with compassion and a good
conscience, the number of his
elect might be saved.

13  Ye were sincere, and without
offence towards each other; not
mindful of injuries; all sedition
and schism was an abomination
unto you.

14  Ye bewailed every one his
neighbours' sins, esteeming their
defects your own.

15 Ye were kind one to another
without grudging; being ready to
every good work. And being
adorned with a conversation
altogether virtuous and religious,
ye did all things in the fear of
God; whose I commandments were
written upon the tables of your
heart.


CHAPTER II.

     How their divisions began.

ALL honour and enlargement
was given unto you; and so
was fulfilled that which is written,
my beloved did eat and drink, he
was enlarged and waxed fat, and
he kicked.

2  From hence came emulation,
and envy, and strife, and sedition;
persecution and disorder, war and
captivity.

3  So they who were of no renown,
lifted up themselves against
the honourable; those of no
reputation against those who were
in respect; the foolish against the
wise; the young men against the
aged.

4  Therefore righteousness and
peace are departed from you,
because every one hath forsaken
the fear of God; and is grown blind
in his faith; nor walketh by the
rule of God's commandments nor
liveth as is fitting in Christ:

5  But every one follows his
own wicked lusts: having taken
up an unjust and wicked envy, by
which death first entered into the
world.


CHAPTER III.

     Envy and emulation the original of all
     strife and disorder.  Examples of the
     mischiefs they have occasioned.

FOR thus it is written,
And in process of time it came to
pass, that Cain brought of the fruit
of the ground an offering unto the
Lord. And Abel, he also brought
of the firstlings of his flock,
and of the fat thereof:

2  And the Lord had respect unto
Abel, and to his offering. But
unto Cain and unto his offering he
had not respect. And Cain was
very sorrowful, and his countenance
fell.

3  And the Lord said unto Cain,
Why art thou sorrowful? And
why is thy countenance fallen?
If thou shalt offer aright, but not
divide aright, hast thou not sinned?
Hold thy peace: unto thee shall
be his desire, and thou shalt rule
over him.

4  And Cain said unto Abel his
brother, Let us go down into the
field. And it came to pass, as
they were in the field, that Cain
rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.

5  Ye see, brethren, how envy
and emulation wrought the death
of a brother. For this, our father
Jacob fled from the face of his
brother Esau.

6  It was this that caused Joseph
to be persecuted even unto death,
and to come into bondage. Envy
forced Moses to flee from the
face of Pharoah king of Egypt,
when he heard his own countryman
ask him, "Who made thee a Judge,
and a ruler over us? Wilt thou
kill me as thou didst the
Egyptian yesterday?"

7  Through envy Aaron and Miriam
were shut out of the camp, from
the rest of the congregation
seven days.

8  Emulation's sent Dathan and
Abiram quick into the grave because
they raised up a sedition against
Moses the servant of God.

9  For this, David was not
only hated of strangers, but was
persecuted even by Saul the king
of Israel.

10  But not to insist upon ancient
examples, let us come to those
worthies that have been nearest
to us; and take the brave
examples of our own age.

11  Through zeal and envy, the
most faithful and righteous pillars
of the church have been persecuted
even to the most grievous deaths.

12  Let us set before our eyes,
the holy Apostles; Peter by unjust
envy underwent not one or two,
but many sufferings; till at last
being martyred, he went to the
place of glory that was due unto
him.

13  For the same cause did
Paul in like manner receive the
reward of his patience. Seven
times he was in bonds; he was
whipped, was stoned; he preached
both in the East and in the West;
leaving behind him the glorious
report of his faith:

14  And so having taught the
whole world righteousness, and
for that end travelled even to
the utmost bounds of the West;
he at last suffered martyrdom
by the command of the governors,

15  And departed out of the
world, and went unto his holy
place; having become a most
eminent pattern of patience
unto all ages.

16  To these Holy Apostles
were joined a very great number
of others, who having through
envy undergone in like manner
many pains and torments, have
left a glorious example to us.

17  For this, not only men but
women have been persecuted;
and having suffered very grievous
and cruel punishments, have
finished the course of their faith
with firmness; and though weak
in body, yet received a glorious
reward.

18  This has alienated the
minds even of women from their
husbands; and changed what was
once said by our father Adam;
This is now bone of my bones,
and flesh of my flesh.

19  In a word, envy and strife,
have overturned whole cities, and
rooted out great nations from off
the earth.


CHAPTER IV.

     4 He exhorts them to live by holy rules, and repent
     of their divisions, and they shall be forgiven.

THESE things, beloved, we
write unto you, not only for
your instruction, but also for our
own remembrance.

2  For we are all in the same
lists, and the same combat is
prepared for us all.

3  Wherefore let us lay aside all
vain and empty cares; and let us
come up to the glorious and
venerable rule of our holy calling.

4  Let us consider what is good,
and acceptable and well-pleasing
in the sight of him that made us.

5  Let us look steadfastly to the
blood of Christ, and see how
precious his blood is in the sight
of God: which being shed for our
salvation, has obtained the grace
of repentance for all the world.

6  Let us search into all the
ages that have gone before us;
and learn that our Lord has in
every one of them still given place
for repentance to all such as would
turn to him.

7  Noah preached repentance;
and as many as hearkened to him
were saved. Jonah denounced
destruction against the Ninevites.

8  Howbeit they repenting of
their sins, appeased God by their
prayers: and were saved, though
they were strangers to the covenant
of God.

9  Hence we find how all the
ministers of the grace of God
have spoken by the Holy Spirit of
repentance. And even the Lord of
all, has himself declared with an
oath concerning it;

10  As I live, saith the Lord,
I desire not the death of a sinner,
but that he should repent. Adding
farther this good sentence, saying
Turn from your iniquity, O house
of Israel.

11  Say unto the children of
my people, though your sins should
reach from earth to heaven; and
though they shall be redder than
scarlet, and blacker than sackcloth
yet if ye shall turn to me with all
your heart, and shall call me
father, I will hearken to you, as
to a holy people.

12  And in another place he saith
on this wise: wash ye, make you
clean; put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes;
cease to do evil, learn to do well;
seek judgment, relieve the
oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow.

13  Come now and let us reason
together, saith the Lord: though
your sins be as scarlet, they shall
be as white as snow; though they
be as red as crimson, they shall
be as wool.

14  If ye be willing and obedient
ye shall eat the good of the land
but, if ye refuse and rebel, ye
shall be devoured with the sword;
for the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it.

15  These things has God
established by his Almighty will,
desiring that all his beloved
should come to repentance.


CHAPTER V.

     1 He sets before them the examples of holy men,
     whose piety is recorded in the Scripture.

WHEREFORE let us obey his
excellent and glorious will;
and imploring his mercy and
goodness, let us fall down upon
our faces before him, and cast
ourselves upon his mercy; laying
aside all vanity, and contention,
and envy which leads unto death.

2  Let us look up to those who
have the most perfectly ministered
to his excellent glory. Let us
take Enoch for our example;
who being found righteous in
obedience, was translated, and
his death was not known.

3  Noah being proved to be
faithful, did by his ministry,
preach regeneration to the world;
and the Lord saved by him all the
living creatures, that went with
one accord into the ark.

4  Abraham, who was called
God's friend, was in like manner
found faithful; inasmuch as he
obeyed the commands of God.

5  By obedience he went out of
his own country, and from his
own kindred, and from his father's
house; that so forsaking a small
country, and a weak affinity, and
a little house, he might inherit
the promises of God.

6  For thus God said unto him;
"get thee out of thy country, and
from thy kindred, and from thy
father's house, unto a land that
I will show thee."

7  "And, I will make thee a great
nation, and will bless thee, and
make thy name great, and thou
shalt be blessed.   And I will
bless them that bless thee, and
curse them that curse thee; and
in thee shall all families of the
earth be blessed,"

8  And again when he separated
himself from Lot, God said unto
him; I Lift up now thine eyes, and
look from the place where thou
art northward, and southward, and
eastward, and westward, for all
the land which thou seest, to thee
will I give it, and to thy seed for
ever.

9  And I will make thy seed as
the dust of the earth, so that if a
man can number the dust of the
earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered.

10  And again he saith: and
God brought forth Abraham, and
said unto him; look now toward
heaven, and tell the stars, if thou
be able to number them: so shall
thy seed be.

11  And Abraham believed God,
and it was counted to him for
righteousness.

12  Through faith and hospitality
he had a son given him in his
old age; and through obedience
he offered him up in sacrifice to
God, upon one of the mountains
which God showed into him.


CHAPTER VI.

     1  Redemption for such as have been eminent for their
     faith, kindness, and charity to their neighbours.

BY hospitality and goodliness
was Lot saved out of Sodom,
when all the country round about
was destroyed by fire and brimstone.

2  The Lord thereby making it
manifest, that he will not forsake
those that trust in him; but will
bring the disobedient to punishment
and correction.

3  For his wife who went out
with him, being of a different
mind, and not continuing in the
same obedience, was for that reason
set forth for an example, being
turned into a pillar of salt
unto this day.

4  That so all men may know,
that those who are double minded,
and distrustful of the power of
God, are prepared for condemnation,
and to be a sign to all succeeding
ages.

5  By faith and hospitality was
Rahab the harlot saved. For when
the spies were sent by Joshua the
son of Nun to search out Jericho,
and the king of Jericho knew that
they were come to spy out his
country, he sent men to take them,
so that they might be put to
death.

6  Rahab therefore, being hospitable,
received them, and hid them under
the stalks of flax, on the top of
her house.

7  And when the messengers that
were sent by the king came unto
her, and asked her, saying,
There came men unto thee to spy
out the land, bring them forth, for
so hath the king commanded: She
answered, The two men whom ye
seek came unto me, but presently
they departed, and are gone: Not
discovering them unto them.

8  Then she said to the spies,
I know that the Lord your God has
given this city into your hands;
for the fear of you is fallen upon
all that dwell therein. When,
therefore, ye shall have taken it,
ye shall save me and my father's
house.

9  And they answered her, saying,
It shall be as thou hast spoken
unto us, Therefore, when thou
shalt know that we are near, thou
shalt gather all thy family together,
upon the house-top and they shall
be saved: but all that shall be
found without thy house shall
be destroyed.

10  And they gave her moreover
a sign, that she should hang
out of her house a scarlet rope,
showing thereby, that by the
blood of our Lord, there should be
redemption to all that believe and
hope in God. Ye see, beloved,
how there was not only faith, but
prophesy too in this woman.


CHAPTER VII.

     1 What rules are given for leading a holy life.

LET us, therefore, humble ourselves,
brethren, laying aside all pride,
and boasting, and foolishness,
and anger: And let us do as it
is written.

2  For thus saith the Holy Spirit;
Let not the wise man glory in his
wisdom, nor the strong man in
his strength, nor the rich man
in his riches; but let him that
glorieth, glory in the Lord, to seek
him, and to do judgment and justice.

3  Above all, remembering the
words of the Lord Jesus, which he
spake concerning equity and long
suffering, saying,

4  Be ye merciful, and ye shall
obtain mercy; forgive, and ye
shall be forgiven; as ye do, so
shall it be done unto you; as ye
give, so shall it be given unto
you; as ye judge, so shall ye be
judged; as ye are kind to others,
so shall God be kind to you; with
what measure ye mete, with the
same shall it be measured to you
again.

5  By this command, and by
these rules, let us establish
ourselves, that so we may always
walk obediently to his holy words;
being humble minded:

6  For so says the Holy Scripture;
upon whom shall I look, even upon
him that is poor and of a contrite
spirit, and that trembles at my word.

7  It is, therefore, just and
righteous, men and brethren, that
we should become obedient unto God,
rather than follow such as through
pride and sedition, have made
themselves the ring-leaders of
a detestable emulation.

8  For it is not an ordinary harm
that we shall do ourselves, but
rather a very great danger that we
shall run, if we shall rashly give
up ourselves to the wills of men,
who promote strife and seditions,
to turn us aside from that which is
fitting.

9  But let us be kind to one
another, according to the compassion
and sweetness of him that made us.

10  For it is written, The merciful
shall inherit the earth; and they
that are without evil shall be left
upon it: but the transgressors shall
perish from off the face of it.

11  And again he saith, I have
seen the wicked in great power
and spreading himself like the
cedar of Libanus. I passed by,
and lo! he was not; I sought his
place, but it could not be found.

12  Keep innocently, and do the
thing that is right, for there shall
be a remnant to the peaceable
man.

13  Let us, therefore, hold fast
to those who religiously follow
peace; and not to such as only
pretend to desire.

14  For he saith in a certain
place, This people honoureth me
with their lips, but their heart
is far from me.

15  And again, They bless with
their mouths, but curse in their
hearts.

16  And again he saith, They
loved him with their mouths, and
with their tongues they lied to
him. For their heart was not right
with him, neither were they
faithful in his covenant.

17  Let all deceitful lips become
dumb, and the tongue that speaketh
proud things. Who have said, with
our tongue will we prevail; our lips
are our own, who is Lord over us?

18  For the oppression of the
poor, for the sighing of the needy,
now will I arise saith the Lord;
I will set him in safety, I will
deal confidently with him.


CHAPTER VIII.

     He advises then, to be humble, and, follow the
     examples of Jesus, and of holy men in all ages.

FOR Christ is theirs who are
humble, and not who exalt
themselves over his flock. The
sceptre of the majesty of God, our
Lord Jesus Christ, came not in
the show of pride and arrogance,
though he could have done so;
but with humility as the Holy
Ghost had before spoken
concerning him.

2  For thus he saith, Lord, who
hath believed our report, and to
whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed; For he shall grow up
before him as a tender plant, and
as a root out of a dry ground;

3  He hath no form or comeliness,
and when we shall see him, there
is no beauty that we should desire
him.

4  He is despised and rejected of
men; a man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief.

5  And we hid, as it were, our
faces from him; he was despised,
and we esteemed him not.

6  Surely he hath borne our
griefs, and carried our sorrows
yet we did esteem him stricken,
smitten of God, and afflicted.

7  But he was wounded for our
transgressions; he was bruised for
our iniquities; the chastisement
of our peace was upon him; and
with his stripes we are healed.

8  All we like sheep have gone
astray; we have turned every one
to his own way; and the Lord hath
laid on him the iniquity of us all.

9  He was oppressed, and he was
afflicted, yet he opened not his
mouth: he is brought as a lamb to
the slaughter; and as a sheep
before her shearers is dumb,
so he openeth not his mouth.

10  He was taken from prison
and from judgment; and who shall
declare this generation? For he
was cut off out of the land of the
living: for the transgression of my
people was he stricken.

11  And he made his grave with
the wicked, and with the rich in
his death; because he had done no
violence, neither was any deceit
in his mouth.

12  Yet it pleased the Lord to
bruise him; he hath put him to
grief: when thou shalt make his
soul an offering for sin, he shall
see his seed, he shall prolong his
days, and the pleasure of the Lord
shall prosper in his hand.

13  He shall see of the travail
of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
by his knowledge shall my righteous
servant justify many; for he shall
bear their iniquities.

14  Therefore will I divide him
a portion with the great, and he
shall divide the spoil with the
strong; because he hath poured
out his soul unto death; and he
was numbered with the transgressors,
and he bare the sin of many, and
made intercession for the
transgressors.

15  And again he himself saith,
I am a worm and no man, a reproach
of men, and despised of the people.
All they that see me laugh me to
scorn; they shoot out their lips,
they shake their heads, saying;
He trusted in the Lord that he
would deliver him, let him
deliver him seeing he delighted
in him.

16  Ye see, beloved, what the
pattern is that has been given to
us.  For if the Lord thus humbled
himself, what should we do who
are brought by him under the
yoke of his grace?

17  Let us be followers of those
who went about in goat-skins, and
sheep-skins; preaching the coming
of Christ.

18  Such were Elias, and Eliaxus,
and Ezekiel, the prophets,
And let us add to these, such
others as have received the like
testimony.

19  Abraham has been greatly
witnessed of; having been called
the friend of God. And yet he
steadfastly beholding the glory of
God, says with all humility, I am
dust and ashes.

20  Again of Job, it is thus
written, That he was just, and
without blame, true; one that served
God, and abstained from all evil.
Yet he accusing himself, said, No
man is free from pollution, no,
not though he should live but one
day.

21  Moses was called faithful in
all God's House; and by his conduct
the Lord punished Israel by stripes
and plagues.

22  And even this man, though
thus greatly honoured, spake not
greatly of himself; but when the
oracle of God was delivered to him
out of the bush, he said, Who
am I, that thou dost send me? I
am of a slender voice, and a slow
tongue.

23  And again he saith, I am as
the smoke of the pot.

24  And what shall we say of
David, so highly testified of in the
Holy Scriptures? To whom God said,
I have found a man after my own
heart, David the son of Jesse,
with my holy oil have I anointed
him.

25  But yet he himself saith unto
God, Have mercy upon me, O God,
according to thy loving kindness;
according unto the multitude of
thy tender mercies, blot out my
transgressions.

26  Wash me thoroughly from
mine iniquity, and cleanse me
from my sin. For I acknowledge
my transgressions, and my sin is
ever before me.

27  Against Thee only have I
sinned, and done this evil in
thy sight; that thou mightest
be justified when thou speakest;
and be clear when thou judgest.

28  Behold I was shapen in
iniquity, and in sin did my mother
conceive me.

29  Behold, thou desirest truth
in the inward parts; and in the
hidden part thou shalt make me to
know wisdom.

30  Purge me with hyssop, and
I shall be clean: wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.

31  Make me to hear joy and
gladness, that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoice.

32  Hide thy face from my sins,
and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart O God;
and renew a right spirit
within me.

34  Cast me not away from thy
presence, and take not thy holy
spirit from me.

35  Restore unto me the joy of
thy salvation, and uphold me with
thy free spirit.

36  Then will I teach transgressors
thy ways, and sinners shall be
converted unto thee.

37  Deliver me from blood-guiltiness,
O God, thou God of my salvation;
and my tongue shall sing aloud
of thy righteousness.

38  O Lord open thou my lips,
and my mouth shall show forth
thy praise.

39  For thou desirest not sacrifice,
else would I give it; thou
delightest not in burnt-offerings.

40  The sacrifices of God are
a broken spirit; a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt
not despise.


CHAPTER IX.

     He again persuades them to compose their divisions.

THUS has the humility and
godly fear of these great
and excellent men recorded in
the Scriptures, through obedience,
made not only us, but also the
generations before us better;
even as many as have received his
holy oracles with fear and truth.

2  Having therefore so many,
and such great and glorious
examples, let us return to that
peace which was the mark that
from the beginning was set before
us;

3  Let us look up to the Father
and Creator of the whole world;
and let us hold fast to his glorious
and exceeding gifts and benefits
of peace.

4  Let us consider and behold
with the eyes of our understanding
his long suffering will; and think
how gentle and patient he is
towards his whole creation.

5  The heavens moving by his
appointment, are subject to him
in peace.

6  Day and night accomplish the
courses that he has allotted unto
them, not disturbing one another.

7  The sun and moon, and all the
several companies and constellations
of the stars, run the courses that
he has appointed to them in concord,
without departing in the least from
them.

8  The fruitful earth yields its
food plentifully in due season both
to man and beast, and to all animals
that are upon it, according to his
will; not disputing, nor altering
any thing of what was ordered by him.

9  So also the unfathomable and
unsearchable floods of the deep,
are kept in by his command;

10  And the conflux of the vast
sea, being brought together by his
order into its several collections,
passes not the bounds that he has
set to it;

11  But as he appointed it, so it
remains. For he said,  Hitherto
shalt then come, and thy floods
shall be broken within thee.

12  The ocean impassable to
mankind, and the worlds that are
beyond it are governed by the
same commands of their great
master.

13  Spring and summer, autumn
and winter, give place peaceably
to each other.

14  The several quarters of the
winds fulfil their work in their
seasons, without offending one
another.

15  The ever-flowing fountains,
made both for pleasure and health,
never fail to reach out their breasts
to support the life of men.

16  Even the smallest creatures
live together in peace and concord
with each other.

17  All these has the Great Creator
and Lord of all, commanded to
observe peace and concord; being
good to all.

18  But especially to us who flee
to his mercy through our Lord
Jesus Christ; to whom be glory
and majesty for ever and ever.
Amen.


CHAPTER X.

     He exhorts them to obedience, from the consideration
     of the goodness of God, and of his presence in every place.

TAKE heed, beloved, that his
many blessings be not to our
condemnation; except we shall
walk worthy of him, doing with
one consent what is good and
pleasing in his sight.

2  The spirit of the Lord is a
candle, searching out the inward
parts of the belly.

3  Let us therefore consider how
near he is to us; and how that
none of our thoughts, or reasonings
which we frame within ourselves,
are hid from him,

4  It is therefore just that we
should not forsake our rank, by
doing contrary to his will.

5  Let us choose to offend a few
foolish and inconsiderate men,
lifted up and glorying in their
own pride, rather than God.

6  Let us reverence our Lord
Jesus Christ whose blood was
given for us.

7  Let us honour those who are
set over us; let us respect the
aged that are amongst us; and let
us instruct the younger men, in
the discipline and fear of the
LORD.

8  Our wives let us direct, to do
that which is good.

9  Let them show forth a lovely
habit of purity, in all their
conversation; with a sincere
affection of meekness.

10  Let the government of their
tongues be made manifest by their
silence.

11  Let their charity be without
respect of persons, alike towards
all such as religiously fear
God.

12  Let your children be bred
up in the instruction of Christ:

13  And especially let them learn
how great a power humility has
with God; how much a pure and
holy charity avails with him; how
excellent and great his fear is;
and how it will save all such as
turn to him with holiness in a pure
mind.

14  For he is the searcher of the
thoughts and counsels of the heart;
whose breath is in us, and when
he pleases he can take it from
us.


CHAP. XI.

     Of faith: and particularly what we are
     to believe as to the Resurrection.

BUT all these things must be
confirmed by the faith which
is in Christ; for so He himself
bespeaks us by the Holy Ghost;

2  Come ye children and hearken
unto me, and I will teach you the
fear of the Lord. What man is
there that desireth life, and loveth
to see good days?

3  Keep thy tongue from evil,
and thy lips that they speak no
guile.

4  Depart from evil and do good;
seek peace and pursue it.

5  The eyes of the Lord are upon
the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their prayers.

6  But the face of the Lord is
against them that do evil, to cut
off the remembrance of them from
the earth.

7  The righteous cried, and the
Lord heard him, and delivered
him out of all his troubles.

8  Many are the troubles of the
wicked; but they that trust in the
Lord mercy shall encompass them
about.

9  Our all-merciful and beneficent
Father hath bowels of compassion
towards them that fear him: and
kindly and lovingly bestows his
graces upon all such as come to
him with a simple mind.

10  Wherefore let us not waver,
neither let us have any doubt in
our hearts, of his excellent and
glorious gifts.

11  Let that be far from us
which is written, Miserable are
the double-minded, and those who
are doubtful in their hearts;

12  Who say these things have
we heard, and our fathers have
told us these things. But behold
we are grown old, and none of
them has happened unto us.

13 O ye fools consider the trees:
take the vine for an example.
First it sheds its leaves; then it
buds; after that it spreads its
leaves; then it flowers; then come
the sour grapes; and after them
follows the ripe fruit. See how in
a little time the fruit of the trees
comes to maturity.

14  Of a truth yet a little while
and his will shall suddenly be
accomplished.

15  The Holy Scripture itself
bearing witness, that He shall
quickly come and not tardy, and
that the Lord shall suddenly come
to his temple, even the 3 holy ones
whom ye look for.

16  Let us consider, beloved,
how the Lord does continually
show us, that there shall be a
future resurrection; of which he
has made our Lord Jesus Christ
the first fruits, raising him from
the dead.

17  Let us contemplate, beloved,
the resurrection that is continually
made before our eyes.

18  Day and night manifest a
resurrection to us. The night lies
down, and the day arises: again
the day departs and the night
comes on.

19  Let us behold the fruits of
the earth. Every one sees how the
seed is sown. The sower goes
forth, and casts it upon the earth;
and the seed which when it was
sown fell upon the earth dry and
naked, in time dissolves.

20  And from the dissolution,
the great power of the providence
of the Lord rises it again; and of
one seed many arise, and bring
forth fruit.


CHAPTER XII.

     The Resurrection further proved.

LET us consider that wonderful
type of the resurrection which
is seen in the Eastern countries:
that is to say, in Arabia.

2  There is a certain bird called
a Phoenix;  of this there is never
but one at a time: and that lives
five hundred years. And when
the time of its dissolution draws
near, that it must die, it makes
itself a nest of frankincense, and
myrrh, and other spices into which
when its time is fulfilled it enters
and dies.

3  But its flesh putrefying, breeds
a certain worm, which being nourished
with the juice of the dead bird
brings forth feathers; and when
it is grown to a perfect state,
it takes up the nest in which
the bones of its parent lie, and
carries it from Arabia into Egypt,
to a city called Heliopolis:

4  And flying in open day in the
sight of all men, lays it upon the
altar of the sun, and so returns
from whence it came.

5  The priests then search into
the records of the time: and find
that it returned precisely at the
end of five hundred years.

6  And shall we then think it to
be any very great and strange
thing for the Lord of all to raise
up those that religiously serve him
in the assurance of a good faith,
when even by a bird he shows us
the greatness of his power to fulfil
his promise?

7  For he says in a certain place,
Thou shalt raise me up and I shall
confess unto thee.

8  And again, I laid me down
and slept, and awaked, because
thou art with me.

9  And again, Job says, Thou
shalt raise up this flesh of mine,
that has suffered all these
things.

10  Having therefore this hope,
let us hold fast to him who is
faithful in all his promises, and
righteous in all his judgments;
who has commanded us not to lie,
how much more will he not
himself lie?

11  For nothing is impossible
with God but to lie.

12  Let his faith then be stirred
up again in us; and let us consider
that all things are nigh unto him.

13  By the word of his power he
made all things: and by the same
word he is able, (whenever he
will,) to destroy them.

14  Who shall say unto him,
what dost thou? or who shall
resist the power of his strength?

15  When, and as he pleased,
he will do all things; and nothing
shall pass away of all that has been
determined by him.

16  All things are open before
him; nor can anything be hid
from his counsel.

17 The heavens declare the
glory of God, and the firmament
showeth his handy work. Day
unto day uttereth speech, and
night unto night showeth
knowledge. There is no speech nor
language where their voice is not
heard.


CHAPTER XIII.

     It is impossible to escape the vengeance of God,
     if we continue in sin.

SEEING then all things are seen
and heard by God, let us fear
him, and let us lay aside our
wicked works which proceed from
ill desires; that through his mercy
we may be delivered from the
condemnation to come.

2  For whither can any of us flee
from his mighty hand? Or what
world shall receive any of those
who run away from him?

3  For thus saith the Scripture
in a certain place. Whither shall
I flee from thy spirit, or where
shall I hide myself from thy
presence?

4  If I ascend up into heaven,
thou art there; if I shall go to the
uttermost parts of the earth, there
is thy right hand: if I shall make
my bed in the deep, thy Spirit is
there.

5  Whither then shall any one
go; or whither shall he run from
him that comprehends all things?

6  Let us therefore come to him
with holiness of heart, lifting up
chaste and undefiled hands unto
him; loving our gracious and
merciful Father, who has made us
to partake of his election.

7  For so it is written, When
the Most High divided the nations;
when he separated the sons of
Adam, he set the bounds of the
nations, according to the number
of his angels; his people Jacob
became the portion of the Lord,
and Israel the lot of his
inheritance.

8  And in another place he saith,
Behold the Lord taketh unto himself
a nation, out of the midst of the
nations, as a man taketh the first-
fruits of his flour; and the Most
Holy shall come out of that nation.


CHAPTER XIV.

     How we must live that we may please God.

WHEREFORE we being apart
of the Holy One: let us do
all those things that pertain unto
holiness:

2  Fleeing all evil-speaking
against one another; all filthy
and impure embraces, together with
all drunkenness, youthful lusts,
abominable concupiscences,
detestable adultery, and
execrable pride.

3  For God saith, he resisteth
the proud, but giveth grace to the
humble.

4  Let us therefore hold fast to
those to whom God has given his
grace.

5  And let us put on concord,
being humble, temperate; free
from all whispering and detraction;
and justified by our actions,
not our words.

6  For he saith, Doth he that
speaketh and heareth many things,
and is of a ready tongue, suppose
that he is righteous?  Blessed is
he that is born of a woman, that
liveth but a few days: use not
therefore much speech.

7  Let our praise be of God, not
of ourselves; for God hateth those
that commend themselves.

8  Let the witness of our good
actions be given to us by others,
as it was given to the holy men
that went before us.

9  Rashness, and arrogance, and
confidence, belong to them who
are accursed of God: but equity,
and humility, and mildness, to
such as are blessed by him.

10  Let us then lay hold of his
blessing, and let as consider what
are the ways by which we may
attain unto it.

11  Let us look back upon those
things that have happened from
the beginning.

12  For what was our Father
Abraham blessed? Was it not
because that through faith he
wrought righteousness and truth?

13  Isaac being fully persuaded
of what he knew was to come,
cheerfully yielded himself up for
a sacrifice. Jacob with humility
departed out of his own country,
fleeing from his brother, and went
unto Laban and served him; and
so the sceptre of the twelve tribes
of Israel was given unto him.

14  Now what the greatness of
this gift was, will plainly appear,
if we shall take the pains distinctly
to consider all the parts of it.

15  For, from him came the
priests and Levites; who all
ministered at the altar of God.

16  From him came our Lord
Jesus Christ, according to the
flesh.

17  From him came the kings,
and princes, and rulers in Judah.

18 Nor were the rest of his
tribes in any little glory: God
having promised that their seed
shall be as the stars of heaven.

19  They were all therefore
greatly glorified, not for their own
sake, or for their own works, or
for the righteousness that they
themselves wrought, but through
his will.

20  And we also being called by
the same will in Christ Jesus, are
not justified by ourselves, neither
by our own wisdom, or knowledge,
or piety, or the works which we
have done in the holiness of our
hearts.

21  But by that faith, by which
God Almighty has justified all
men from the beginning; to whom
be glory for ever and ever, Amen.


CHAPTER XV.

     We are justified by faith; yet this must not
     lessen our care to live a virtuous life,
     nor our pleasure in it.

WHAT shall we do therefore,
brethren? Shall we be slothful
in well-doing, and lay aside
our charity?   God forbid that any
such thing should be done by us.

2  But rather let us hasten with
all earnestness and readiness of
mind, to perfect every good work.
For even the Creator and Lord of
all things himself rejoices in his
own works.

3  By his Almighty power he
fixed the heavens, and by his
incomprehensible wisdom he
adorned them.

4  He also divided the earth
from the water, with which it is
encompassed: and fixed it as a
secure tower, upon the foundation
of his own will.

5  He also by his appointment,
commanded all the living creatures
that are upon it, to exist.

6  So likewise the sea, and all
the creatures that are in it;
having first created them, he
enclosed them therein by his power.

7  And above all, he with his
holy and pure hands, formed man,
the most excellent; and, as to his
understanding, truly the greatest
of all other creatures; the character
of his own image.

8  For thus God says; Let us
make man in our image, after our
own likeness; so God created man,
male and female created he them.

9  And having thus finished all
these things, he commended all
that he had made, and blessed
them, and said, increase and
multiply.

10  We see how all righteous men
have been adorned with good works
Wherefore even the Lord himself,
having adorned himself with his
works, rejoiced.

11  Having therefore such an
example, let us without delay,
fulfil his will; and with all
our strength, work the work of
righteousness.


CHAPTER XVI.

     A virtuous life enforced from the examples
     of the holy angels, and from the exceeding
     greatness of that reward which God has prepared for us.

THE good workman with
confidence receives the bread of
his labour; but the sluggish and
lazy cannot look him in the face
that set him on work.

2  We must therefore be ready
and forward in well-doing: for
from him are all things.

3  And thus he foretells us,
behold the Lord cometh, and his
reward is with him, even before his
face, to render to everyone according
to his work.

4  He warns us therefore beforehand,
with all his heart to this end,
that we should not be slothful and
negligent in well-doing.

5  Let our boasting, therefore,
and our confidence be in God
let us submit ourselves to his will,
Let us consider the whole multitude
of his angels, how ready they
stand to minister unto his will.

6  As saith the Scripture,
thousands of thousands stood
before him and ten thousand
times ten thousand ministered
unto him. And they cried, saying,
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
hosts; The whole earth is full
of his glory.

7  Wherefore let us also, being
conscientiously gathered together
in concord with one another; as
it were with one mouth, cry,
earnestly unto him, that he would
make us partakers of his great and
glorious promises.

8  For he saith, a Eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the
things which God has prepared for
them that wait for him,


CHAPTER XVII.

     1 We must attain the gifts of God by faith and obedience,
     which we must carry on in an orderly pursuing of the
     duties of our several stations, without envy or contention.
     24 The necessity of different orders among men.
     33 We have none of us anything but what we received of God:
     whom therefore we ought in every condition thankfully to obey.

HOW blessed and wonderful,
beloved, are the gifts of God.

2  Life in immortality! brightness
in righteousness! truth in full
assurance! faith in confidence!
temperance in holiness!

3  And all this has God subjected
to our understandings:

4  What therefore shall those
things be which he has prepared
for them that wait for him?

5  The Creator and Father of
spirits, the Most Holy; he only
knows both the greatness and
beauty of them,

6 Let us therefore strive with
all earnestness, that we may be
found in the number of those that
wait for him, that so we may
receive the reward which he has
promised.

7  But how, beloved, shall we do
this? We must fix our minds by
faith towards God, and seek those
things that are pleasing and
acceptable unto him.

8  We must act conformably to
his holy will; and follow the way
of truth, casting off from us all
unrighteousness and iniquity,
together with all covetousness,
strife, evil manners, deceit,
whispering, detractions; all
hatred of God, pride and boasting;
vain-glory and ambition;

9  For they that do these things
are odious to God; and not only
they that do them, but also all
such as approve of those that do
them.

10  For thus saith the Scripture,
But unto the wicked, God said,
What hast thou to do to declare
my statute, or that thou shouldst
take my covenant in thy mouth?
Seeing that thou hatest instruction,
and castest my words behind thee.

11  When thou sawest a thief,
then thou consentedst with him;
thou hast been partaker with
adulterers, Thou givest thy mouth
to evil, and thy tongue frameth
deceit. Thou sittest and speakest
against thy brother; thou slanderest
thine own mother's son.

12  These things hast thou done
and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
that I was altogether such a one
as thyself: but I will reprove thee,
and set them in order before thine
eyes.

13  Now consider this ye that
forget God, lest I tear you in pieces,
and there be none to deliver.

14  Whose offereth praise,
glorifieth me; And to him that
disposeth his way aright, will
I show the salvation of God.

15  This is the way, beloved, in
which we may find our Saviour,
even Jesus Christ, the high-priest
of all our offerings, the defender
and helper of our weakness.

16  By him we look up to the
highest heavens; and behold, as
in a glass, his spotless and most
excellent visage.

17  By him are the eyes of our
hearts opened; by him our foolish
and darkened understanding
rejoiceth to behold his wonderful
light.

18 By him would God have us
to taste the knowledge of
immortality: who being the
brightness of his glory, is by
so much greater than the angels,
as he has by inheritance obtained
a more excellent name than they.

19  For so it is written, who
maketh his angels spirits, and his
ministers a flame of fire:

20  But to his son, thus saith the
Lord, Thou art my Son, to-day
have I begotten thee.

21  Ask of me and I will give
thee the heathen for thy inheritance,
and the utmost parts of the earth
for thy possession.

22  And again he saith unto him,
Sit thou on my right hand until
I make thine enemies thy
foot-stool.

23  But who are his enemies?
even the wicked, and such who
oppose their own wills to the
will of God.

24  Let us therefore march-on,
men and brethren, with all
earnestness in his holy laws.

25  Let us consider those who
fight under our, earthly governors
How orderly, how readily, and
with what exact obedience they
perform those things that are
commanded them.

26  All are not generals, nor
colonels, nor captains, nor
inferior officers:

27  But everyone in his respective
rank does what is commanded him by
the king, and those who have the
authority over him.

28  They who are great, cannot
subsist without those that are little;
nor the little without the great;

29  But there must be a mixture
in all things, and then there will
be use and profit too.

30  Let us, for example, take
our body: the head without the
feet is nothing, neither the feet
without the head.

31  And even the smallest members
of our body are yet both necessary
and useful to the whole body.

32  But all conspire together,
and are subject to one common
use, namely, the preservation of
the whole body.

33 Let therefore our whole body
by saved in Christ Jesus; and let
everyone be subject to his neighbour,
according to the order in which
he is placed by the gift of God.

34  Let not the strong man despise
the weak; and let the weak see that
he reverence the strong.

35  Let the rich man distribute
to the necessity of the poor; and
let the poor bless God, that he has
given one unto him, by whom his
want may be supplied.

36  Let the wise man show forth
his wisdom, not in words, but in
good works.

37  Let him that is humble, not
bear witness to himself, but let
him leave it to another to bear
witness of him.

38  Let him that is pure in the
flesh, not grow proud of it, knowing
that it was from another that he
received the gift of continence.

39  Let us consider therefore,
brethren, whereof we are made;
who, and what kind of men we
came into the world, as it were
out of a sepulchre, and from outer
darkness.

40  He hath made us, and formed
us, brought us into his own world;
having presented us with his
benefits, even before we were born.

41  Wherefore, having received
all these things from him, we
ought in everything to give thanks
unto him, to whom be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.


CHAPTER XVIII.

     Clement therefore exhorts them to do everything
     orderly in the Church, as the only way to please God.

FOOLISH and unwise men, who
have neither prudence, nor
learning, may mock and deride
us; being willing to set up
themselves in their own conceits.

2  But what can a mortal man
do? Or what strength is there in
him that is made out of the dust?

3  For it is written, there was no
shape before mine eyes; only I
heard a sound and a voice.

4  For what? Shall man be pure
before the Lord? Shall he be
blameless in his works?

5  Behold, he trusteth not in
his servants; and his angels he
chargeth with folly.

6  Yes, the heaven is not clean
in his sight, how much less they
that dwell in houses of clay; of
which also we ourselves were
made?

7  He smote them as a moth:
and from morning even unto the
evening they endure not. Because
they were not able to help
themselves, they perished;
he breathed upon them and they
died, because they had no wisdom.

8  Call now if there be any that
will answer thee; and to which of
the angels wilt thou look?

9  For wrath killeth the foolish
man, and envy slayeth him that is
in error.

10  I have seen the foolish taking
root, but lo, their habitation was
presently consumed.

11  Their children were far from
safety, they perished at the gates
of those who were lesser than
themselves: and there was no man
to help them.

12  For what was prepared for
them, the righteous did eat; and
they shall not be delivered from
evil.

13  Seeing then these things are
manifest unto us, it will behove
us to take care that looking into
the depths of the divine knowledge,
we do all things in order,
whatsoever our Lord has commanded
us to do.

14  And particularly that we
perform our offerings and service to
God, at their appointed seasons
for these he has commanded to be
done, not rashly and disorderly,
but at certain determinate times
and hours.

15  And therefore he has ordained
by his supreme will and authority,
both where, and by what persons,
they are to be performed; that
so all things being piously done
unto all well-pleasing, they
may be acceptable unto him.

16  They therefore who make
their offerings at the appointed
seasons, are happy and accepted;
because through obeying the
commandments of the Lord,
they are free from sin.

17  And the same care must be
had of the persons that minister
unto him.

18  For the chief-priest has his
proper services; and to the priest
their proper place is appointed;
and to the Levites appertain their
proper ministries; and the layman
is confined within the bounds of
what is commanded to laymen.

19  Let every one of you therefore,
brethren, bless God in his proper
station, with a good conscience,
and with all gravity, not exceeding
the rule of his service that is
appointed to him.

20  The daily sacrifices are not
offered everywhere; nor the peace-
offerings, nor the sacrifices
appointed for sins and transgressions;
but only at Jerusalem: nor in any
place there, but only at the altar
before the temple; that which is
offered being first diligently
examined by the high-priest and
the other minister we before
mentioned.

21  They therefore who do any
thing which is not agreeable to his
will, are punished with death.

22  Consider, brethren, that by
how much the better knowledge
God has vouchsafed unto us, by so
much the greater danger are we
exposed to.


CHAPTER XIX.

     The orders of Ministers in Christ's Church established
     by the Apostles, according to Christ's command,
     7 after the example of Moses.
     16 Therefore they who have been duly placed in the
     ministry according to their order, cannot without
     great sin be put out of it.

THE Apostles have preached to
us from the Lord Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ from God.

2  Christ therefore was sent by
God, the Apostles by Christ; so
both were orderly sent, according
to the will of God.

3  For having received their
command, and being thoroughly
assured by the resurrection of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and convinced
by the word of God, with the
fulness of the Holy Spirit, they
went abroad, publishing, That the
kingdom of God was at hand.

4  And thus preaching through
countries and cities, they appointed
the first fruits of their conversion
to be bishops and ministers over
such as should afterwards believe,
having first proved them by the
Spirit.

5  Nor was this any new thing;
seeing that long before it was
written concerning bishops and
deacons.

6  For thus saith the Scripture,
in a certain place; I will appoint
their overseers in righteousness,
and their ministers in faith.

7  And what wonder if they, to
whom such a work was committed
by God in Christ, established such
officers as we before mentioned;
when even that blessed and faithful
servant in all his house, Moses,
set down in the Holy Scriptures
all things that were commanded
him.

8  Whom also all the rest of the
prophets followed, bearing witness
with one consent to those things
that were appointed by him.

9  For he, perceiving an emulation
to arise among the tribes concerning
the priesthood, and that there was
a strife about it, which of them
should be adorned with that glorious
name; commanded their twelve captains
to bring to him twelve rods; every
tribe being written upon its rod,
according to its name,

10  And he took them and bound
them together, and sealed them
with the seals of the twelve princes
of the tribes: and laid them up in
the tabernacle of witness, upon
the table of God.

11  And when he had shut the
door of the tabernacle, he sealed
up the keys of it, in like manner
as he had done the rods; and said
unto them, Men and brethren,
whichsoever tribe shall have its
rod blossom, that tribe has God
chosen to perform the office of a
priest, and to minister unto him
in holy things.

12  And when the morning was
come, he called together all Israel,
six hundred thousand men; and
showed to the princes their seals
and opened the tabernacle of
witness; and brought forth the
rods.
