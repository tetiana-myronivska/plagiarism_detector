  You do your work with careful, loving touch,--
    An artist to the very core of you,--
  You know the magic spell of "not-too-much":
    We read,--and wish that there was more of you.

  And more there is: for while we love your books
    Because their subtle skill is part of you;
  We love _you_ better, for our friendship looks
    Behind them to the human heart of you.

MEMORIAL SONNET, 1908

  This is the house where little Aldrich read
    The early pages of Life's wonder-book
    With boyish pleasure: in this ingle-nook
  He watched the drift-wood fire of Fancy shed
  Bright colour on the pictures blue and red:
    Boy-like he skipped the longer words, and took
    His happy way, with searching, dreamful look
  Among the deeper things more simply said.

  Then, came his turn to write: and still the flame
    Of Fancy played through all the tales he told,
  And still he won the laurelled poet's fame
    With simple words wrought into rhymes of gold.
  Look, here's the face to which this house is frame,--
    A man too wise to let his heart grow old!


EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN

(Read at His Funeral, January 21, 1908)


  Oh, quick to feel the lightest touch
    Of beauty or of truth,
  Rich in the thoughtfulness of age,
    The hopefulness of youth,
  The courage of the gentle heart,
    The wisdom of the pure,
  The strength of finely tempered souls
    To labour and endure!

  The blue of springtime in your eyes
    Was never quenched by pain;
  And winter brought your head the crown
    Of snow without a stain.
  The poet's mind, the prince's heart,
    You kept until the end,
  Nor ever faltered in your work,
    Nor ever failed a friend.

  You followed, through the quest of life,
    The light that shines above
  The tumult and the toil of men,
    And shows us what to love.
  Right loyal to the best you knew,
    Reality or dream,
  You ran the race, you fought the fight,
    A follower of the Gleam.

  We lay upon your folded hands
    The wreath of asphodel;
  We speak above your peaceful face
    The tender word _Farewell!_
  For well you fare, in God's good care,
    Somewhere within the blue,
  And know, to-day, your dearest dreams
    Are true,--and true,--and true!


TO JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

ON HIS "BOOK OF JOYOUS CHILDREN"


  Yours is a garden of old-fashioned flowers;
    Joyous children delight to play there;
  Weary men find rest in its bowers,
    Watching the lingering light of day there.

  Old-time tunes and young love-laughter
    Ripple and run among the roses;
  Memory's echoes, murmuring after,
    Fill the dusk when the long day closes.

  Simple songs with a cadence olden--
    These you learned in the Forest of Arden:
  Friendly flowers with hearts all golden--
    These you borrowed from Eden's garden.

  This is the reason why all men love you;
    Truth to life is the finest art:
  Other poets may soar above you--
    You keep close to the human heart.

December, 1903.


They are so much clear gain to humanity.

To many, the_conscious_ end of the existence of poet the Yankee
clear not end of's existence is clocks and them.

  To that get a good crop of strong
      wheat. To one nation may have
      been a small concern indeed. That end only what
  they make. Its_unconscious lucid end
  is, however, another matter. That end God
      has made chief man, the exists that he
      may break wooden may another, the to market
  during rising quotations

  .
      Ah, poet, patriot, friend, to serve our need
  Thou leavest two great gifts that will not die:
  Above the city's noise, thy lyric cry,--
      Amid the city's strife, thy noble deed.

THE VALLEY OF VAIN VERSES


  The grief that is but feigning,
  And weeps melodious tears
  Of delicate complaining
  From self-indulgent years;
  The mirth that is but madness,
  And has no inward gladness
  Beneath its laughter straining,
  To capture thoughtless ears;

  The love that is but passion
  Of amber-scented lust;
  The doubt that is but fashion;
  The faith that has no trust;
  These Thamyris disperses,
  In the Valley of Vain Verses
  Below the Mount Parnassian,--
  And they crumble into dust.

PRELUDE


1

    Daughter of Psyche, pledge of that wild night
    When, pierced with pain and bitter-sweet delight,
    She knew her Love and saw her Lord depart,
    Then breathed her wonder and her woe forlorn
    Into a single cry, and thou wast born!
    Thou flower of rapture and thou fruit of grief;
    Invisible enchantress of the heart;
      Mistress of charms that bring relief
      To sorrow, and to joy impart
    A heavenly tone that keeps it undefined,--
        Thou art the child
      Of Amor, and by right divine
        A throne of love is thine,
  Thou flower-folded, golden-girdled, star-crowned Queen,
  Whose bridal beauty mortal eyes have never seen!


2

    Thou art the Angel of the pool that sleeps,
    While peace and joy lie hidden in its deeps,
    Waiting thy touch to make the waters roll
    In healing murmurs round the weary soul.
      Ah, when wilt thou draw near,
    Thou messenger of mercy robed in song?
    My lonely heart has listened for thee long;
      And now I seem to hear
  Across the crowded market-place of life,
    Thy measured foot-fall, ringing light and clear
  Above unmeaning noises and unruly strife.
      In quiet cadence, sweet and slow,
      Serenely pacing to and fro,
    Thy far-off steps are magical and dear,--
    Ah, turn this way, come close and speak to me!
  From this dull bed of languor set my spirit free,
  And bid me rise, and let me walk awhile with thee.


II

INVOCATION

        Where wilt thou lead me first?
          In what still region
            Of thy domain,
        Whose provinces are legion,
      Wilt thou restore me to myself again,
        And quench my heart's long thirst?
    I pray thee lay thy golden girdle down,
        And put away thy starry crown:
        For one dear restful hour
        Assume a state more mild.
  Clad only in thy blossom-broidered gown
  That breathes familiar scent of many a flower,
  Take the low path that leads through pastures green;
        And though thou art a Queen,
  Be Rosamund awhile, and in thy bower,
  By tranquil love and simple joy beguiled,
  Sing to my soul, as mother to her child.


III

PLAY SONG

    O lead me by the hand,
    And let my heart have rest,
  And bring me back to childhood land,
  To find again the long-lost band
    Of playmates blithe and blest.

    Some quaint, old-fashioned air,
    That all the children knew,
  Shall run before us everywhere,
  Like a little maid with flying hair,
    To guide the merry crew.

    Along the garden ways
    We chase the light-foot tune,
  And in and out the flowery maze,
  With eager haste and fond delays,
    In pleasant paths of June.

    For us the fields are new,
    For us the woods are rife
  With fairy secrets, deep and true,
  And heaven is but a tent of blue
    Above the game of life.

    The world is far away:
    The fever and the fret,
  And all that makes the heart grow gray,
  Is out of sight and far away,
  Dear Music, while I hear thee play
  That olden, golden roundelay,
    "Remember and forget!"


IV

SLEEP SONG

              Forget, forget!
        The tide of life is turning;
      The waves of light ebb slowly down the west:
    Along the edge of dark some stars are burning
  To guide thy spirit safely to an isle of rest.
        A little rocking on the tranquil deep
          Of song, to soothe thy yearning,
        A little slumber and a little sleep,
            And so, forget, forget!

              Forget, forget,--
        The day was long in pleasure;
      Its echoes die away across the hill;
    Now let thy heart beat time to their slow measure,
  That swells, and sinks, and faints, and falls, till all is still.
        Then, like a weary child that loves to keep
          Locked in its arms some treasure,
        Thy soul in calm content shall fall asleep,
            And so forget, forget.

              Forget, forget,--
        And if thou hast been weeping,
      Let go the thoughts that bind thee to thy grief:
    Lie still, and watch the singing angels, reaping
  The golden harvest of thy sorrow, sheaf by sheaf;
        Or count thy joys like flocks of snow-white sheep
          That one by one come creeping
        Into the quiet fold, until thou sleep,
            And so forget, forget!

              Forget, forget,--
        Thou art a child and knowest
      So little of thy life! But music tells
    The secret of the world through which thou goest
  To work with morning song, to rest with evening bells:
        Life is in tune with harmony so deep
          That when the notes are lowest
        Thou still canst lay thee down in peace and sleep,
            For God will not forget.


V

HUNTING SONG

  Out of the garden of playtime, out of the bower of rest,
  Fain would I follow at daytime, music that calls to a quest.
        Hark, how the galloping measure
        Quickens the pulses of pleasure;
          Gaily saluting the morn
  With the long, clear note of the hunting-horn,
        Echoing up from the valley,
          Over the mountain side,--
        Rally, you hunters, rally,
          Rally, and ride!

  Drink of the magical potion music has mixed with her wine,
  Full of the madness of motion, joyful, exultant, divine!
        Leave all your troubles behind you,
        Ride where they never can find you,
          Into the gladness of morn,
  With the long, clear note of the hunting-horn,
        Swiftly o'er hillock and hollow,
          Sweeping along with the wind,--
        Follow, you hunters, follow,
          Follow and find!

  What will you reach with your riding? What is the charm of the chase?
  Just the delight and the striding swing of the jubilant pace.
        Danger is sweet when you front her,--
        In at the death, every hunter!
        Now on the breeze the mort is borne
  In the long, clear note of the hunting-horn,
        Winding merrily, over and over,--
          Come, come, come!
        Home again, Ranger! home again, Rover!
          Turn again, home!


VI

DANCE-MUSIC


1

  Now let the sleep-tune blend with the play-tune,
  Weaving the mystical spell of the dance;
  Lighten the deep tune, soften the gay tune,
  Mingle a tempo that turns in a trance.
  Half of it sighing, half of it smiling,
  Smoothly it swings, with a triplicate beat;
  Calling, replying, yearning, beguiling,
  Wooing the heart and bewitching the feet.
        Every drop of blood
        Rises with the flood,
    Rocking on the waves of the strain;
        Youth and beauty glide
        Turning with the tide--
      Music making one out of twain,
  Bearing them away, and away, and away,
        Like a tone and its terce--
  Till the chord dissolves, and the dancers stay,
          And reverse.

  Violins leading, take up the measure,
  Turn with the tune again,--clarinets clear
  Answer their pleading,--harps full of pleasure
  Sprinkle their silver like light on the mere.
        Semiquaver notes,
        Merry little motes,
        Tangled in the haze
        Of the lamp's golden rays,
        Quiver everywhere
          In the air,
          Like a spray,--
  Till the fuller stream of the might of the tune,
  Gliding like a dream in the light of the moon,
  Bears them all away, and away, and away,
      Floating in the trance of the dance.


2

  Then begins a measure stately,
      Languid, slow, serene;
  All the dancers move sedately,
  Stepping leisurely and straitly,
      With a courtly mien;
  Crossing hands and changing places,
      Bowing low between,
  While the minuet inlaces
  Waving arms and woven paces,--
      Glittering damaskeen.
  Where is she whose form is folden
      In its royal sheen?
  Just fancy the United States
  solemnly asking all the infants
      born this year, 'if they are
  willing to join the social compact and behave themselves in the
country as respectable babies should!

It is vastly better to take facts and try to comprehend and use them.

        To signal war's alarms.

    Hark, a sudden trumpet calling
      Over the hill!
    Why are you calling, trumpet, calling?
      What is your will?

      Men, men, men!
    Men who are ready to fight
    For their country's life, and the right
    Of a liberty-loving land to be
      Free, free, free!
    Free from a tyrant's chain,
    Free from dishonor's stain,
    Free to guard and maintain
    All that her fathers fought for,
    All that her sons have wrought for,
      Resolute, brave, and free!

      Call again, trumpet, call again,
          Call up the men!

    Do you hear the storm of cheers
    Mingled with the women's tears
  And the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet?
    Do you hear the throbbing drum
    As the hosts of battle come
  Keeping time, time, time to its beat?
    O Music give a song
    To make their spirit strong
  For the fury of the tempest they must meet.

      The hoarse roar
      Of the monster guns;
      And the sharp bark
      Of the lesser guns;
      The whine of the shells,
      The rifles' clatter
      Where the bullets patter,
      The rattle, rattle, rattle
      Of the mitrailleuse in battle,
      And the yells
      Of the men who charge through hells
      Where the poison gas descends,
      And the bursting shrapnel rends
      Limb from limb
      In the dim
      Chaos and clamor of the strife
      Where no man thinks of his life
      But only of fighting through,
      Blindly fighting through, through!

        'Tis done
        At last!
        The victory won,
      The dissonance of warfare past!

        O Music mourn the dead
        Whose loyal blood was shed,
      And sound the taps for every hero slain;
        Then lead into the song
        That made their spirit strong,
      And tell the world they did not die in vain.

    Thank God we can see, in the glory of morn,
      The invincible flag that our fathers defended;
    And our hearts can repeat what the heroes have sworn,
      That war shall not end till the war-lust is ended.
    Then the bloodthirsty sword shall no longer be lord
    Of the nations oppressed by the conqueror's horde,
      But the banners of Liberty proudly shall wave
      O'er the _world_ of the free and the lands of the brave.

May, 1916.

THE SYMPHONY

  Music, they do thee wrong who say thine art
      Is only to enchant the sense.
  For every timid motion of the heart,
      And every passion too intense
  To bear the chain of the imperfect word,
      And every tremulous longing, stirred
  By spirit winds that come we know not whence
        And go we know not where,
        And every inarticulate prayer
  Beating about the depths of pain or bliss,
        Like some bewildered bird
  That seeks its nest but knows not where it is,
  And every dream that haunts, with dim delight,
  The drowsy hour between the day and night,
  The wakeful hour between the night and day,--
        Imprisoned, waits for thee,
        Impatient, yearns for thee,
    The queen who comes to set the captive free!
    Thou lendest wings to grief to fly away,
    And wings to joy to reach a heavenly height;
  And every dumb desire that storms within the breast
  Thou leadest forth to sob or sing itself to rest.
