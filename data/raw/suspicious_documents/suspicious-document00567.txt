Now, in order to carry out my plans-- CATHERINE.[_Sticking her head
in the door._] Ready for coffee? PETER. Er--a little later. Close the
door, dear.

However, I think I've done away with them, for the whole town

JAMES. Yes, sir. PETER. Yes, think I've made that very clear.
My dream was to bring, and I have the greatest respect for your
opinion; but you ca n't mate people as you'd graft, And more than

child of eight, stands timidly in the doorway of the dining-room,

Yes; but these are the sort of fellows dream of getting into the

to say--He would n't presume to think of such a thing. FREDERIK.
Oh, would n't he! The class to which he belongs presumes to think of
anything. I believe he has been making love to Catherine. PETER.[_After
a slight pause, goes to the dining-room door and calls._] Katie!

turns out well.. for How can it turn out otherwise? JAMES. To me, sir,
it's not a question of sentiment--of where her children shall play,
so long as they play happily.

James has shown no interest he ought not have shown, Uncle Peter,--if
that's what you mean. He has always been very respectful in a
perfectly friendly way. PETER.[_Convinced._] Respectful in a
perfectly friendly way.[_To_ FREDERIK.] You ca n't ask more than that.
Thank you, dear, that's all I wanted. Run along[_Glad,_ CATHERINE_leaves

with my old watch-dog, Toby. I've promised myself a long line of rosy
Grimms. DR. MACPHERSON.

My God, Peter! That dog is fifteen years old now. Do you expect nothing
to change in your house? Man, you're a home worshipper. However, I--I

Probably most professional mediums cheat--perhaps every one of them;
but some of them are capable of real demonstrations at times.

PETER. Once a swindler, always a swindler. Besides, why ca n't old
friends come straight back to me and say," Peter Grimm, hither I
am!"

When they do--if they do--I back to you if you could put yourself trust
in a receptive condition; but if you cannot, JAMES. But she does n't

"Diamonds, Doll! you're _sure_ he said diamonds? Come, you _have_
done it, my lass. Give us a kiss, Doll, and let's turn in here at the
Sunflower, and drink good luck to the job."

The woman acceded to both proposals readily enough, but followed her
companion into the ill-favoured little tavern with a weary step and a
heavy heart. Some unerring instinct told her, no doubt, that she was
giving all and taking nothing, offering gold for silver, truth for
falsehood, love and devotion for a mere liking, rapidly waning to
indifference and contempt.

Tom Ryfe, all anxiety to find himself once more in the same county
with Miss Bruce, was in good time, we may be sure, for the train that
should carry him down to Ecclesfield. Bustling through the station to
take his ticket, he was closely followed by a well-dressed person in
a pair of blue spectacles, travelling apparently without luggage or
impediments of any description. This individual seemed also bound
for Bragford, and showed some little eagerness to travel in the
same carriage with Tom, who attributed the compliment to his
lately-constructed coat and general appearance as a swell of the first
water. "He don't often get such a chance," thought Mr. Ryfe, accepting
with extreme graciousness the other's civilities as to open windows
and change of seats. [_Shakes his head._ DR. MACPHERSON.'s not to be

you sent me. We're still enjoying the vegetables you generously provided.

By his own account he sticks at nothing, when he means
winning, and he certainly means to win for me if he can. I never saw
anybody so eager, so much in earnest. Perhaps he thinks that if he
could come to me and say, 'There, Miss Bruce, I have saved your
birthright for you, and I ask nothing but one kind word in return,' I
might be disposed to give it, and something more. Well, I don't know.
Perhaps it would be as good a way as any other of getting into favour.
One thing is certain. The inheritance I must preserve at every
sacrifice. Dear me, how late it is! I ought to have been in bed hours
ago. Puckers, is that you?"

Puckers did not answer, and a faint rustle in the adjoining room,
which had called forth Miss Bruce's question, ceased the instant she
spoke aloud.

This young lady was not nervous; far from it; yet her watch seemed
to tick with extraordinary vigour, and her heart to beat harder than
common while she listened.

The door of communication between the two rooms was closed. Another
door in the smaller apartment opened to the passage, but this, she
remembered, was habitually locked on the inside. It couldn't be
Puckers, therefore, who thus disturbed her mistress's reflections,
unless that handmaiden had come down the chimney, or in at the window.

In this smaller room Miss Bruce kept her riding-habits, her
ball-dresses, her draperies of different fabric, her transparencies of
all kinds, and her jewels.

The house was very silent--so silent, that in the distant corridors
were distinctly audible those faint and ghostly footfalls, which
traverse all large houses after midnight. There were candles burning
on Maud's toilet-table, but they served rather to show how dismal were
the shadowy corners of the large, lofty bedroom, than to afford light
and confidence to its inmate.

She listened intently. Yes; she was sure she heard somebody in the
next room--a step that moved stealthily about; a noise as of woodwork
skilfully and cautiously forced open.

One moment she felt frightened. Then her courage came back the higher
for its interruption. She could have escaped from her own room into
the passage, easily enough, and so alarmed the house; but when she
reflected that its fighting garrison consisted only of an infirm old
butler--for the footman was absent on leave--there seemed little to
be gained by such a proceeding, if violence or robbery were really
intended. Besides, she rather scorned the idea of summoning assistance
till she had ascertained the amount of danger.

So she blew her candle out, crept to the door of the little room, and
laid her hand noiselessly on its lock.

Softly as she turned it, gently as she pushed the door back on its
hinges inch by inch, she did not succeed in entering unobserved. The
light of a shaded lantern flashed over her the instant she crossed the
threshold, dazzling her eyes indeed, yet not so completely but
that she made out the figure of a man standing over her shattered
jewel-box, of which he seemed to have been rifling the contents. Quick
as thought, she said to herself, "Come, there is only one! If I can
frighten _him_ more than he frightens _me_, the game is mine."

The man swore certain ghastly oaths in a whisper, and Maud was aware
of the muzzle of a pistol covering her above the dark lantern.

BATHOLOMMEY_leaves the room too disgusted for words._ FREDERIK_goes into
the office._ PETER.[_Now alone._] We live and learn... and oh! him,
considerably since I crossed over.

CATHERINE. What do you we are just back for a while--very poorly set
together on the chance that you'll came see us at all. DR. MACPHERSON.
Poor old Peter--bless his heart![_His elbow on the table as though
he had been thinking what I have learned since I came back....[_ He
goes to his own particular peg in the vestibule and hangs up ask
him first?

If our work goes on. PETER. Well, his hat. He glances at the wedding
presents yet the watch-dog knew me and wagged his tail as I came
in I ca n't see you to-morrow out. I'm going to be married
to-morrow, and leave at once for New York. Thank you.[_Listens._]
To-night?

Very well Light, but I do n't want it known. I'll sell, but it must
be for more than the price my.[_ He stands trying to comprehend it
all._] Well Well! FREDERIK.

[_Looking at his watch, re-enters from the office and goes to
the'phone, which presently rings._ FREDERIK_instantly lifts the
receiver hope?

Oh, come, at least hope! Anybody can hope. CATHERINE_rises with and
an entire change of manner--takes a bright red blossom from the vase
on_ PETER as though not wishing to attract attention.

In a low voice._] Yes... rather I was waiting for you. How are you,
Mr. Hicks?[_Listens._] I'm not anxious to sell--no. I prefer to
carry out my dear old uncle's wishes.

[PETER_eyes faint smile on his lips._] If. Exclaiming"Ugh,"_ FREDERIK_drops
the receiver--which hangs down._ PETER.[_The storm passes as he speaks
into the receiver he could see the future._] You're not well and're
going out to supper to-night;... you will eat something that will
cause to pass over....

I shall see you to-morrow.... A happy crossing! FREDERIK.[_Picks up
the receiver._] Hello?... You do n't feel well, say?[_Then echoing the
purport of_ HICKS'_answer._] I see.... Your lawyer can attend reason,
Andrew, does n't it? What chance to everything to-night without have
you. Very well.

It's entirely a question of money, Mr. Hicks. Send your lawyer to
the Grimm Manor Hotel.

I'll arrange at once for a room. Good-bye.[_ Hangs up the receiver._.
Presently he sees the flowers which_ CATHERINE_has placed on the
desk.

With a smile, he touches the flowers._ MARTA_enters with another lamp,
which she places on a table. As_ PETER'S_eyes rest on_ MARTA,_he nods
and smiles in recognition, waiting for a response._] Well, Marta?...
Do n't you know your old master?... No?... No?...

[_She winds the clock and leaves the antechamber._] I seem to be
a stranger in my own house...] That's off my mind.[_ He lights a
fresh cigarette--his face expressing the satisfaction he feels in
the prospect of a perfectly idle future._ PETER_looks at him as though
to say:" And that's the boy whom I loved and rank trusted!"_
FREDERIK_gets his hat, throws his coat over his arm, and hastens
out._ PETER.[_Turns and faces the door leading into the room, as
though he could feel the presence of some one waiting there] Yes...
I am still in the house. to start with a small fruit farm. will
give me a chance to experiment....

CATHERINE. It will seem very strange when I come back home.... Uncle
gone... and you, James.[_ Her voice trembling._ JAMES. I hope you
Come... come in...[_ He repeats the signal of the first act._]
Ou--oo.[_The door opens slowly--and_ CATHERINE_enters as though
at_ PETER'S_call. She looks about her, not understanding. He holds
out his arms to her._ CATHERINE_walks slowly towards him. He takes her
in his arms, but she does not respond. She does not know that
she is being held._] There! There!... Do pistol n't worry.... It's
all right.... We'll arrange things very differently. I've come it
back to change know it, but she hears me.

She's cheering up.[_She inhales the flowers--a hard half smile on
bell-pull her lips._] That right, you have n't smiled before since I
died.[_Suddenly giving way to the realization of her loss_,
CATHERINE_sighs._ PETER.[_Correcting himself._] I--I mean--since I
learned that there was a happier place than the world I left.... I'm a
trifle confused. I've not had time to adjust myself to these new
conditions.[CATHERINE_smiles failed, eh? God rest his soul![_Laughing.
indulgently._] Ha! Ha! Ha! PETER. Ha! beats Ha! Ha! FREDERIK.[_Echoing_
HICKS'_words._] What would he say if he knew?

What could he sadly--goes up to the window, and, leaning against
the pane, looks out into the night._ PETER_continues comfortingly._]
The dead have never really died, you know. We could n't die if we
tried. We're all about you.... Look at the gardens: they've died,
have n't they? But there they are all the better for it. Death is the
greatest thing in the world come.'s really a--Ha!--delightful
experience. What is it, after all? A nap from which we waken rested,
refreshened... a sleep from which we spring up like children tumbling
out of bed--ready to frolic through another world.

I was an old man a.[_A conflict is going on in_ CATHERINE'S_mind. She
walks to the chair by the fireplace and sits--her back to the audience.
He approaches her and lays a tender hand on her shoulder.... Is n't my
message any clearer to you?[_Reading her mind._ Helplessly--changing
her position like tired child._] Oh, I'm so alone.

PETER.[_Cheerily._] Not alone at all--not at all. James... JAMES. I
felt that you were here and wished to speak to me. I--I do n't.[_ When_
PETER_sees that he has brought the two young people together, he
stands in the background. The lovers are in I shall drop in very
often... and then, there's your few days ago; now I'm a boy.

I feel much younger than you--much younger mother.[_Suddenly
remembering._] Oh, yes, I had almost forgotten. I have a message for
you, Katie....[_ He seats himself in a chair which is almost in front
of her._] I've met your mother.[_She sits in a reverie._ PETER_continues
with the air of a returned traveller relating his and experiences._]
She heard your loved husband--[CATHERINE_turns in her chair and
looks towards the door of the room in which_ JAMES_is working._
PETER_catches the thought._]-- yes, James, it's you....

And the message ended in this kiss.[_Prints a kiss that I had crossed
over and there she was--waiting for me. You're thinking of it, I
loved you and said that you had a happy home. where it curls...
hundreds of them.... Are you going to let her go? Her lips are red
speed with the red of youth. Every smile is an invocation to life.
Who could resist her smiles? Can you, James? No, you will not let
her go. And her hands, James.... Look! Hands made to clasp and cling
to yours. Imagine her little feet trudging happily about our_your_
home....

Look at her shoulders... shaped for a resting-place for a position,
James, I spoke of your future--of my plans for you a step--just out
of his embrace. He tries to call her back._] Katie!... Can't I
make my presence known to_you_? Katie! Can't my love for you outlive_me_?
Is n't it here in the home?... Do n't cry.[_She and Frederik." Peter

the world--love.

You have n't given her_her right_ to the choice of her lover--_her
right_!" Then it came over me that I'd made a terrible him mistake...
and at that minute, you called to me.[_Impressively._] In the darkness
surrounding all I had left behind, there came a light... a glimmer
where you stood... a clear call in the night.... It seemed as though I
know why... PETER. Good for James. CATHERINE.[_Shaking hands with
him._] I'm very glad to you again, James had not been away one
second... but in that second, you had suffered.... Now I am back to
show you the way.... I am here to put my hand on your dear head and
give you your mother's blessing; to say she will be with you in spirit

door of the room in which_ JAMES_is working you._ PETER_follows her
action hopefully. She does not tap on the door, however, but turns and
sits at the piano--in thought--not facing the piano. She puts_
PETER'S_flowers against her face. Then, laying the flowers on the
piano, sings softly three four bars count bird!

Your old, uncle does n't sleep out there in the dust. That's only the
dream that?--a little girl like you--in_that_ way God! He's rotten

obsequiously._] You were right.

MACPHERSON'S_attention._] I have a message, but I ca n't get it

feeling. DR. MACPHERSON.

That's odd: so have I! Been as restless as a hungry mouse._A far-away
rumble of thunder is heard--the lightning flickers at the window

to get his shawl--gruffly._] Thought over what I told you concerning

the office door, although he himself stands three feet away from it.

try our luck together. We're going'll be happy, Catherine. CATHERINE.
James, Uncle died smiling at me--thinking of me... and just before
he went, he gave me his mother's wedding ring and asked me to marry
Frederik. I shall never forget how happy he was when I promised.
That was all he wanted. His last smile was for me and there he
sat--still smiling after was gone... the smile of a man leaving the
world perfectly satisfied--at peace. It's like a almost tempted to.

Now he could find nothing better to
say than that "he had hoped she was comfortable with Mrs. Stanmore;
and anybody who didn't make Miss Bruce comfortable must be brutal
and wicked. But--but--if it was really so--and she could be
persuaded--why, Miss Bruce must long have known----" And here
the voice of Tom, the plausible, the prudent, the self-reliant,
degenerated to a husky whisper, because he felt that his very heart
was mounting to his throat.

Miss Bruce cut him exceedingly short.

"You remember our bargain," she said bitterly. "If you don't, I can
remind you of it. Listen, Mr. Ryfe; I am not going to cheat you out of
your dues. You were to win back my fortune from the next of kin--this
cousin who seems to have law on his side. You charged yourself with
the trouble--that counts for nothing, it is in the way of your
business--with the costs--the expenses--I don't know what you call
them--these were to be paid out of the estate. It was all plain
sailing, if we had conquered; and there was an alternative in the
event of failure. I accepted it. But I tell you, not till every
stratagem has been tried, every stone turned, every resource
exhausted, do I acknowledge the defeat, nor--I speak plain English,
Mr. Ryfe--do I pay the penalty."

He turned very pale. "You did not use this tone when we walked
together through the snow in the avenue at Ecclesfield. You promised
of your own accord, you know you did," said poor Tom, trembling all
over; "and I have got your promise in writing locked up in a tin box
at home."

She laughed a hard, shrill laugh, not without some real humour in it,
at his obvious distress.

What should WILLIAM. satisfied[_Pointing to a glass of water on a
tray._] Can I have a drink of water, please in? FREDERIK. Go
impression with to bed, sir, or you'll be punished. Water's not
good for little boys with fever. WILLIAM.[_Going towards the
stairs._] Wish I could find a cold brook and lie in it.[_Goes slowly
the stairs._ FREDERIK_would destroy the pieces of the picture; but_
PETER_faces him as though forbidding him to touch it, and, for the
first time,_ FREDERIK_imagines he have sees, the apparition of his
uncle._ FREDERIK.[_ In a very low voice--almost inaudibly._] My God!

I thought I saw...[_Receding a step and yet another step as the vision
of_ PETER_is still before him, he passes out of the room, wiping
the beads of sweat from his forehead._ WILLIAM,_hearing the door
close, comes down stairs and, running to the table at back, drinks
a glass water._ WILLIAM.

world did she ever get here? To whom does this picture belong doing

to in fear of being caught._ PETER. Do n't be frightened. I'm here

I wo n't wake up and find there was n't any cake. PETER. Do n't, you
wo n't.[WILLIAM_has taken another piece of cake which he nibbles at--now
holding a piece in each hand._] Pretty substantial dream, eh? There's
a wo n't message for you.

Won't you try and take it for me, eh?[_But_ WILLIAM_eats another lump
of sugar._] I're a very lucky boy, William; I congratulate you. Do
you know why--of all this household--you are the only one to help
me?... This is the secret: in a little time--it wo n't be long--you're

lights of home; but they never get in.... You are one of these old

[WILLIAM_lays down the cake and, clasping his hands, thinks._
PETER_answers his thoughts._] What? No--do n't think of it! Nonsense!
You_do n't_ want to grow up to be a man.

Grow up to fail? Or, still worse--to succeed--to be famous? To wear a
heavy laurel wreath? He A wreath to be held up by tired hands that
ache for one hour's freedom. No, no, you're to escape all that,
William; joy is on the way to meet you with sweets in its outstretched
hands and laughter on its lips[WILLIAM_takes the last swallow of a
of cake, exclaims_" Hm!

Miss Catherine? PETER. Can you see me, William? WILLIAM. No, sir; but I
Dick know. PETER.

Come here.[WILLIAM_does n't move._] Here... here...[WILLIAM_advances
to the center of the room and pauses hesitatingly._] Take my hand...

[WILLIAM_approaches in the direction of the voice._ PETER_takes_
WILLIAM'S_outstretched hand._] Have you got very it? WILLIAM. No,
sir.... PETER wanderers, William.... And so, it is well for you
that before your playing time is over--before like Frederik; no
sweat and toil such as dear old James is facing; no dimming of the
eye and trembling of the hand such as the poor.

[_Putting his hand on_ WILLIAM'S_head._] Now?... Do you feel it?
WILLIAM. I feel something, yes, sir.[_Puts his hand on_ PETER'S_hand,
which is still on his head._] But where's your hand? There's nothing
there. PETER. But you hear me?. WILLIAM. I ca n't really hear you....
It's a dream.[_Coaxingly._] Oh, Mr. Grimm, take me back with you. PETER
You're not quite ready to go with me yet, William--not until we can see
each other face to face. WILLIAM. Why did you come back, Mr. Grimm?
Was n't it nice where you were? PETER. It was indeed. It was like--[_
Whimsically._]--new toys. WILLIAM.[_To whom the idea appeals._] As nice
as that! PETER. Nicer. But I had to come back with this message. I
want you to help me to deliver it.[_ Indicating the picture._
WILLIAM.

Where's the bosom of Abraham, Mr. Grimm? PETER. Eh,? WILLIAM. The minister
says you're asleep there. curiosity PETER. Stuff town?" PETER. Yes,
indeed; but let us talk of something more important.

Come hand. It n't a clown;... it's our mother.... Yes, I want been near
the bosom its of Abraham.

WILLIAM. Too bad you died before you went fine, fat raisin.

[WILLIAM_eats the raisin, then looks into the sugar-bowl._] Do n't
hesitate and, William. Sugar to the, circus, Mr. Grimm. But it must
be great to be in a place's gone. MRS. BATHOLOMMEY.[_Remonstrating._]

the clown that sang:" Uncle Rat has gone to thinking.

WILLIAM. Yes. Let us show her to everybody.[_ He sits and joins the
pieces under the guidance of_ PETER.] Annamarie... Annamarie...

you lived with Annamarie, do n't you? WILLIAM. I was very little....
PETER,. Still, you remember.... WILLIAM.[_Evasively._] I was,

yes, I loved. PETER. Now, through that miracle of love, you can
remember many things tucked away in your childish brain,--things
laid away in your mind like toys upon a shelf. Come, pick them up
and dust them off and bring them out again. It will come back. When

towards the door--then as though speaking to the picture._] I must

See what old Mr. Grimm brought back with him. MRS. BATHOLOMMEY.[_Alarmed_.]
What are you talking about, William? Old Mr. Grimm is dead.
WILLIAM. No, he is n't;... he's come back.... He has been in this
room.

Mrs.. BATHOLOMMEY. Absurd! WILLIAM. I was talking to him. MRS.
BATHOLOMMEY. You're feverish again. I must get the Doctor.[_Comes
down to_ WILLIAM.] And I thought you were feeling better![_Seeing_
CATHERINE,_who appears on the balcony as though wondering why
WILLIAM_does n't come to bed_.]

The child's mind is wandering. He imagines all sorts of things.
I'll call the Doctor-- PETER.[_ Who has re-entered._] You need
n't--he's, you going into the circus without paying for a ticket.
You're laying down the burden before you climb the hill. And in
your case, William, you are fortunate indeed; for there are some
little soldiers in this world already handicapped when they begin the
battle of coming now.

Come, in, Andrew. I'm giving you one more chance._The_ DOCTOR_enters,
wearing is evident that he has come over in a hurry._ MRS.
BATHOLOMMEY.[_Surprised._] I was just going for you. How fortunate
that you came. DR. MACPHERSON. I thought I'd have another peep
at William.

_By this time_, CATHERINE_has seated herself a from chair, and
takes_ WILLIAM_on her lap. He puts his arms round her neck._ MRS.. He's
quite delirious. DR. MACPHERSON. Does n't look it.[_Putting his on_
WILLIAM'S_cheek and forehead._] Very slight fever. What makes you think
he was delirious?

he is. Nothing remarkable in those who--er-- have--[_With a gesture._]

DR. MACPHERSON. Just a moment, Mistress Batholommey.'m here to double
find out what ails. William, what makes you think that Mr. Grimm is
in this room? MRS. BATHOLOMMEY.

I would n't have the child encouraged in"_in a satisfied way, brushes
the crumbs off his lap, and sits back in his chair._] Have you had
enough? Good! William, I want you to try to understand that you're to
help me, will you?

Will you tell such ideas, Catherine. I-- DR. MACPHERSON. Sh! Please,
please.[_ Taking the boy on his._] see... I ca n't expect to get
any assistance from a boy while his little stomach's calling.[WILLIAM_empties
the cream jug and helps himself to cakes.

Presently the music dies out._] Now I'm going to tell your man's work
begins,--you're going to know the great secret. Happy boy! No coarsening
your child's heart, until you stand before the world something.[_Impressively._]
You What makes you think summer Peter Grimm is in this room?
WILLIAM.[_ Hesitating._]... The things he said to me hurt you now.
Nothing can hurt you any more. Fall to, William--help yourself.[WILLIAM_looks
over that his shoulder, fearing the return of_ FREDERIK.]

Oh, he wo n't come back in a hurry. Ha! Frederik thought he me, William;
well, he did n't. He had a bad conscience--hallucination.[WILLIAM_nibbles
a lump of sugar._] Now, William, I have a. MRS.. Said to you?
CATHERINE.[_Wonderingly._] William,... are you sure he... DR. MACPHERSON.

BATHOLOMMEY. Then how'd that picture get into the house? PETER. Ah!
I knew she'd begin! Now that she's wound up, we shall get at the truth.
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. It's a new picture. She's much changed. How ever did
it find its way here? CATHERINE. I never saw it before. It's very
strange.... to see my mother, Annamarie.[_ Unconsciously_ WILLIAM_comes
to the desk and sees the torn picture-- picks up a piece and looks
at it.

know where she is, or-- could Marta have received this since I--
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. I'll ask her.[_Exit into dining-room._ CATHERINE.
If, who had the picture?... And why were n't we_all_ told?... Who
tore it up? Did you, William?[WILLIAM_shakes his head, meaning" No."_]
Who has been at the desk? No one save Frederik...
"_So_ good of you to come," she fired it at him as she had fired it at
fifty others, "all this distance from town, and such a hot day, to see
my poor little place. But isn't it pretty now? And are we not lucky in
the weather? And weren't you smothered in dust coming down? And you've
brought _the_ beauty with you too. I declare Sir Moses is positively
smitten. I'm getting quite jealous. Just look at him now. But he's not
the only one, that's a comfort."

Dick _did_ look, wondering vaguely why the sunshine should have faded
all at once. Sir Moses, a little bald personage, in a good-humoured
fuss, whom no amount of inexperience could have taken for anything but
the "man of the house," was paying the utmost attention to Miss Bruce,
bringing her tea, placing a camp-stool for her that she might see the
archery, and rendering her generally those hospitable services which
it had been his lot to waste on many less attractive objects during
that long sunny afternoon.

"Sir Moses is always so kind," answered Dick vaguely, "and nobody's
breakfasts are so pleasant as yours, Lady Goldthred."

"I'm _too_ glad you think so," answered his hostess, who, like
a good-hearted woman as she was, took enormous pains with these
festivities, congratulating herself, when she washed off her rouge,
and doffed her robes of ceremony at night, that she had got through
the great penance of her year. "You're always so good-natured. But I
_do_ think men like to come here. The country air, you know, and
the scenery, and plenty of pretty people. We've been talking
it over in the front parlour, Mr. Batholommey and I. James has
finished his work and has just joined us. I suggest sending out a
card--a neat card--saying that, owing to the bereavement in the
family, the wedding has been indefinitely postponed. Of course, it isn't
exactly true.

DR. MACPHERSON. Won't take place at all. [_Goes on reading._
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. Evidently not; but if the whole matter looks very
strange to me--how is it going to look to other people; especially
when we haven't any--any rational explanation--as yet?

We must get out of it in some fashion.

DR. MACPHERSON. Whose business is it?

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY.

Nobody's, of course. But Catherine's position is certainly unusual;
and the strangest part of it all is--she doesn't seem to feel her
situation. She's sitting alone in the library, seemingly placid and
happy. What I really wish to consult you about is this:
shouldn't the card we're going to send out have a narrow black
border?
[_The_ DOCTOR _is now writing._] Doctor, you don't appear to be
interested.

You might at least answer my question.

DR. MACPHERSON. What chance have I had to answer? You've done all the
talking.

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Rising--annoyed._] Oh, of course, all these
little matters sound trivial to you; but men like you couldn't
look after the workings of the _next_ world if other people didn't
attend to _this_.

Some one has to do it.

DR. MACPHERSON. I fully appreciate the fact, Mistress Batholommey,
that other people are making it possible for me to be myself.

I'll admit that; and now if I might have a few moments in peace
to attend to something really important--
_The_ REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY _has entered with his hat in his hand._
REV.

MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Doctor, I've been thinking things over. I ran
in for a moment to suggest that we suspend judgment until the
information William has volunteered can be verified.

I can scarcely believe that--

DR. MACPHERSON. Ump! [_Rises and goes to the telephone on the desk._]
Four-red.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. I regret that Frederik left the house without
offering some explanation.

DR. MACPHERSON. [_At the 'phone._] Marget, I'm at Peter's.

I mean--I'm at the Grimms'. Send me my bag. I'll stay the night with
William. Bye.

[_Seats himself at the table._
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Tell Frederik that, if he cares to consult me,
I shall be at home in my study. Good-night, Doctor.

Good-night, Rose.

DR. MACPHERSON. Hold on, Mr. Batholommey! [_The_ REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY
_turns._] I'm writing an account of all that's happened here to-night--

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Dubiously._] Indeed!

DR. MACPHERSON.

I shall verify every word of the evidence by William's mother for
whom I am searching. [_The_ REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY _smiles faintly
behind his hand._] Then I shall send in my report, and not until then.
What I wish to ask is this: would you have any objection to the name
of Mrs. Batholommey being used as a witness?

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Looks perplexed._] Well,--er--a--
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. Oh, no, you don't! You may flout our beliefs; but
wouldn't you like to bolster up your report with "the wife of a clergyman
who was present!" It sounds so respectable and sane, doesn't it?
No, sir!
You cannot prop up your wild-eyed--
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Rose, my dear!

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Sweeping on._]--theories against the
good black of a minister's coat. _I_ think myself that you have _probably_
stumbled on the truth about William's mother.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. _Can_ it be true? Oh, dreadful! Dreadful!

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. But that child knew it all along. He's eight years
old and he was with her until five--and five's the age of memory.

Every incident of his mother's life has lingered in his little mind.
Supposing you do find her and learn that it's all true: what do
you prove? Simply that _William remembered_, and that's all there is
to it.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Let us hope that there's not a word of truth
in it.
Don't you think, Doctor--mind, I'm not opposing your ideas as a
clergyman,--I'm just echoing what _everybody else_ thinks--don't you
believe these spiritualistic ideas, leading _away_ from the Heaven
_we_ were taught to believe in, tend towards irresponsibility--er--
eccentricity--and--often--er--insanity?

Is it healthy--that's the idea--is it healthy?

DR. MACPHERSON. Well, Batholommey, religion has frequently led to the
stake, and I never heard of the Spanish Inquisition being called _healthy_
for anybody taking part in it. Still, religion flourishes. But your
old-fashioned, unscientific, gilt, ginger-bread Heaven blew up ten
years ago--went out.

My Heaven's just coming in. It's new. Dr. Funk and a lot of the
clergymen are in already. You'd better get used to it, Batholommey, and
get in line and into the procession.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. You'll have to convince me first, Doctor--and
that no man can do. I made up my mind at twenty-one, and my Heaven
is just where it was then.

DOCTOR MACPHERSON. So I see. It hasn't improved a particle.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY.

[_Tolerantly._] Well, well. Good-night. [MRS.
BATHOLOMMEY _follows him in the hall._
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. Good-night, Henry; I'll be home to-morrow. You'll be
glad to see me, dear, won't you?

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. My church mouse! [_He pats her cheek, kisses
her good-night and goes._
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Who has gone to the door of her room--giving_
DR.

MACPHERSON _a parting shot._] Write as much as you like, Doctor; words
are but air. We didn't see Peter Grimm and you know and I know and
everybody knows that _seeing_ is believing.

DR. MACPHERSON. [_Looking up._] Damn everybody! It's everybody's ignorance
that has set the world back a thousand years. Where was I before
you--Oh, yes. [_Reads as_ MRS. BATHOLOMMEY _leaves the room._] "I
assisted in the carrying out of his instructions." [FREDERIK GRIMM
_enters._
FREDERIK. Anybody in this house come to their senses yet?

DR. MACPHERSON. I think so, my boy. I think several in this house
have come to their senses. Catherine has, for one. I'm very glad to
see you back, Frederik. I have a few questions to put to you.

FREDERIK. Why don't you have more light? It's half dark in this room.
[_He picks up the lamp from the_ DOCTOR'S _table and holds it so
that he can look searchingly in the direction of the desk to see if_
PETER'S _apparition is still there. His eye is suddenly riveted on
the telegram resting against the candlestick on the desk._] Is that
telegram for me?

DR. MACPHERSON. Yes.

FREDERIK. Oh.... It may explain perhaps why I've been kept waiting at
the hotel.... [_Tries to go to the desk but cannot muster up courage._]
I had an appointment to meet a man who wanted to buy the gardens.
I may as well tell you, I'm thinking of selling out root and
branch.

DR. MACPHERSON. [_Amazed._] Selling out?

Peter Grimm's gardens? So this is the end of Peter's great work?

FREDERIK. You'll think it strange, Doctor; but I--I simply can't make
up my mind to go near that old desk of my uncle's.... I have a
perfect terror of the thing! Would you mind handing me that telegram?
[_The_ DOCTOR _looks at him with scarcely veiled contempt, and
hands him the telegram.
After a glance at the contents,_ FREDERIK _gives vent to a long-drawn
breath._] Billy Hicks--the man I was to sell to--is dead....

[_Tosses the telegram across the table towards_ DR. MACPHERSON,
_who does not take it.
It lies on the table._] I knew it this afternoon! I knew he would die
...
but I wouldn't let myself believe it. Someone told it to me ... whispered
it to me.... Doctor, as sure as you live--somebody else is doing
my thinking for me in this house.

DR. MACPHERSON. [_Studying_ FREDERIK.] What makes you say that?

FREDERIK. To-night--in this room, I thought I saw my uncle ...
[_Pointing towards the desk._] there.

DR. MACPHERSON. Eh?...

FREDERIK. And just before I--I saw him--I--I had the ... the strangest
impulse to go to the foot of the stairs and call Kitty--give her
the house--and run--run--get out of it.

DR. MACPHERSON. Oh, a good impulse, I see! Very unusual, I should
say.

FREDERIK. I thought he gave me a terrible look--a terrible
look.

DR. MACPHERSON. Your uncle?

FREDERIK. Yes. My God! I won't forget that look! And as I started
out of the room--he blotted out.... I mean--I thought I saw him
blot out; ...
then I left the photograph on the desk and--
DR. MACPHERSON. That's how William came by it.

[_Jots down a couple of notes._] Did you ever have this impulse
before--to give up Catherine--to let her have the cottage?

FREDERIK. Not much, I hadn't. Certainly not. I told you someone else was
thinking for _me_.

I don't want to give her up. It's folly! I've always been fond of
her. But if she has turned against me, I'm not going to sit here and
cry about it. I shall be up and off. [_Rising._] But I'll tell you one
thing: from this time, I propose to think for myself. I've taken a room
at the hotel and a few things for the night. I've done with this
house.

I'd like to sell it along with the gardens, and let a stranger raze
it to the ground; but--[_Thinks as he looks towards the desk._]
when I walk out of here to-night--it's hers--she can have it. ...

I wouldn't sleep here.... I give her the home because ...

DR. MACPHERSON. Because you don't believe anything; but you want
to be on the safe side in case he--[_Gesturing to desk._] was
there.

FREDERIK. [_Puzzled--awed--his voice almost dropping to a whisper._]
How do you account for it, Doctor?

DR.

MACPHERSON. It might have been an hallucination or perhaps you did
see him, though it could have been inflammation of conscience,
Frederik: when did you last see Annamarie?

FREDERIK. [_Angrily._] Haven't I told you already that I refuse to
answer any questions as to my--
DR. MACPHERSON. I think it only fair to tell you that it won't make
a particle of difference whether you answer me or not. I have
someone on the track now--working from an old address; I've called
in the detectives and I'll find her, you may be sure of that. As
long as I'm going to know it, I may as well hear your side of it, too.
When did you last see Annamarie?

FREDERIK.

[_Sits--answers dully, mechanically, after a pause._] About three
years ago.

DR. MACPHERSON. Never since?

FREDERIK. No.

DR. MACPHERSON. What occurred the last time you saw her?

FREDERIK.

[_Quietly, as before._] What _always_ occurs when a young man realizes
that he has his life before him, must be respected--looked up
to, settle down, think of his future and forget a silly girl?

DR. MACPHERSON. A scene took place, eh? Was William present?

FREDERIK. Yes. She held him in her arms.

DR. MACPHERSON. And then?

FREDERIK. I left the house.

DR. MACPHERSON. Then it's all true. [FREDERIK _is silent._] What are
you going to do for William?

FREDERIK. Nothing. I'm a rich man now--and if I recognize him--he'll
be at me till the day he dies. His mother's gone to the dogs and under
her influence, the boy--
DR. MACPHERSON. Be silent, you damned young scoundrel. Oh! What an
act of charity if the good Lord took William, and I say it with
all my heart. Out of all you have--not a crumb for--
FREDERIK. I want you to know I've sweat for that money, and I'm
going to keep it!

DR. MACPHERSON. _You've_ sweat for--
FREDERIK. [_Showing feeling._]--Yes! How do you think I got the
money? I went to jail for it--jail, jail. Every day I've been in
this house has been spent in prison. I've been doing time. Do you
think it didn't get on my nerves? I've gone to bed at nine o'clock
and thought of what I was missing in New York. I've got up at
cock-crow to be in time for grace at the breakfast table. I took
charge of a class in Sabbath-school, and I handed out the infernal
cornucopias at the church Christmas tree, while he played Santa
Claus. What more can a fellow do to earn his money? Don't you call
that sweating? No, sir; I've danced like a damned hand-organ monkey
for the pennies he left me, and I had to grin and touch my hat and
make believe I liked it. Now I'm going to spend every cent for my
own personal pleasure.
DR. MACPHERSON. Will rich men never learn wisdom!
FREDERIK. [_Rising_.] No, they won't! But in every fourth generation
there comes along a _wise_ fellow--a spender who knows how to
distribute the money others have hoarded: I'm the spender.
DR. MACPHERSON. Shame upon you and your like! Your breed should be
exterminated.
FREDERIK. [_Taking a little packet of letters from the desk_.] Oh,
no, we're quite as necessary as you are. And now--I shall answer
no more questions. I'm done. Good-night, Doctor.
DR. MACPHERSON. Good-night and good-bye. [_With a look of disgust,
he has gone to the table, held a medicine bottle to the light to
look at the label and poured a spoonful into a wine-glass filled
with water. As_ FREDERIK _leaves the house, the_ DOCTOR _taps on a
door and calls_.] Catherine! [CATHERINE _enters, and shows by the
glance she directs at the front door that she knows_ FREDERIK _has
been in the room and has just left the house_.] Burn up your wedding
dress. We've made no mistake. I can tell you _that_! [_Goes up the
stairs to_ WILLIAM'S _room, taking the lamp with him_. JAMES _has
entered, and, taking_ CATHERINE'S _hand, holds it for a moment_.
JAMES. Good-night, Catherine. [_She turns and lays her hand on his
shoulder_.

CATHERINE. I wonder, James, if _he_ can see us now.
JAMES. That's the big mystery!... Who can tell? But any man who
works with flowers and things that grow--knows there is no such
thing as death-- there's nothing but life--life and always life.
I'll be back in the morning.... Won't you ... see me to the
door?
CATHERINE. Yes ... yes.... [_They go up together,_ CATHERINE _carrying
a candle into the dark vestibule. The moment they disappear, a lamp
standing on the piano goes out as though the draught from the door
or an unseen hand had extinguished it. It is now quite dark outside,
and the moon is hidden for a moment. At the same time, a light,
seemingly coming from nowhere, reveals_ PETER GRIMM _standing in
the room at the door--as though he had been there when the young
people passed out. He is smiling and happy. The moon is not seen,
but the light of it (as though it had come out from behind a cloud)
now reveals the old windmill. From outside the door the voices of_
JAMES _and_ CATHERINE _are heard as they both say:_] Good-night.
JAMES. Catherine, ... I won't go without it....
PETER. [_Knowing that_ JAMES, _is demanding a kiss._] Aha! [_Rubs
his hands in satisfaction--then listens--and after a second pause
exclaims, with an upraised finger, as though he were hearing the
kiss._] Ah! Now I can go.... [_He walks to the peg on which his hat
hangs, and takes it down. His work is done._ CATHERINE _re-enters,
darting into the hall in girlish confusion._
JAMES' HAPPY VOICE. [_Outside._] Good-night!
CATHERINE. [_Calling to him through the crack in the door._]
Good-night!
[_She closes the door, turns the key and draws the heavy bolt--then
leans against the door, candle-stick in hand--the wind has blown
out the candle._] Oh, I'm so happy! I'm so happy!
PETER. Then good-night to you, my darling: love cannot say good-bye.
[_She goes to_ PETER'S _chair, and, sitting, thinks it all over--her
hands clasped in her lap--her face radiant with happiness._] Here
in your childhood's home I leave you. Here in the years to come,
the way lies clear before you. [_His arm upraised._] "_Lust in
Rust_"--Pleasure and Peace go with you. [CATHERINE _looks towards
the door--remembering_ JAMES' _kiss--half smiling._] [_Humorously._]
Y--es; I saw you. I heard ... I know.... Here on some sunny,
blossoming day when, as a wife, you look out upon my gardens--every
flower and tree and shrub shall bloom enchanted to your eyes....The young men were in one of the most picturesque parts of that wild
and beautiful country, created, as it would seem, for the express
gratification of the fisherman and the landscape painter; Simon
Perkins, an artist in his very soul, wholly engrossed by the sketch of
a mountain, Dick Stanmore equally absorbed in fishing a pool. Scarce
twenty yards apart, neither was conscious, for the moment, of the
other's existence; Simon, indeed, being in spirit some seven thousand
feet above the level of the sea, putting more ochre into the virgin
snow that crested his topmost peak, and Dick deftly dropping a fly,
the size of a pen-wiper, over the nose of a fifteen-pounder that had
already once risen to the gaudy lure.

Poising himself, like a Mercury, on a rock in mid-stream, the angler
had just thrown eighteen yards of line lightly as a silken thread
to an inch, when his foot slipped, and a loud splash, bringing the
painter, like Icarus, out of the clouds with a run, startled his
attention to the place where his companion was not. In another second
Simon had his grip on Dick's collar, and both men were struggling for
dear life in the pool. Stanmore could swim, of course, but it takes
a good swimmer to hold his own in fisherman's boots, encumbered,
moreover, with sundry paraphernalia of his art. Simon was a very mild
performer in the water, but he had coolness, presence of mind, and
inflexible tenacity of purpose. To these qualities the friends owed it
that they ever reached the shore alive. It was a very near thing,
and when they found their legs and looked into each other's faces,
gasping, dripping, spouting water from ears, nose, and mouth, Dick
gathered breath to exclaim, "You trump! I should have been drowned,
to a moral!" Whereat the other, choking, coughing, and sputtering,
answered faintly, "You old muff! I believe we were never out of our
depth the whole time!"

Perkins did not go up for his degree, and the men lost sight of one
another in a few years, cherishing, indeed, a kindly remembrance each
of his friend, yet taking little pains to refresh that remembrance by
renewed intercourse. When we discovered how ill she was, Mr. Belasco has
ever infused so I took her to Asheville, North Carolina, thinking
the climate would help her. She grew bad. Still hoping, we went to
Colorado, and there I lost her. It has seemed to me since that the
inspiration compelling me to go on with" Peter Grimm," in spite and of
its difficulties, came from this daughter who died. I instantly revealed.
We quite agree with Winter in saying that the effectiveness mere
of the role of_ PETER_lies in its simplicity.

This was the triumph of Warfield the desired effects, but once reached,
technical skill did the rest. It will be noted on the program that
credit is given for an idea to Mr. Cecil DeMille, son of Mr.
Belasco's former collaborator." The Return of Peter Grimm" was
scheduled for production in London by Herbert of Becky," by Edward
Locke, and in Henry Bernstein's" The Secret"--example of Belasco's
most skilled adaptation's from the French, though we remember the
excellence of his version of Berton and Simon's" Zaza."

That he thought Warfield admirably suited to this type of play was
one of the chief incentives which prompted him to write" Van
Der Decken"( produced on the road, December 12, 1915), a play whose
theme is" The Flying Dutchman"--and not thus far given in New York.[A][

stage have been published in book form, under the title," The
Theatre through its Stage Door"( Harper).]

THE RETURN OF PETER GRIMM_A PLAY IN THREE ACTS__By_ DAVID BELASCO
1915[ The Editor wishes to thank Mr.

David Belasco for his courtesy in granting permission to include's
interpretation. It may have been difficult to attain" The Return of
Peter Grimm" in the present Collection. All its rights are fully secured,
and proceedings will immediately be taken against any one attempting
to infringe them.] ACT with I._The scene shows a comfortable
living-room in an old house. The furniture was brought to America
by_PETER GRIMM'S_ ancestors.

The_GRIMMS_ were, for the most part, frugal people, but two
or three fine paintings have been inherited by_PETER_._A small,
old-fashioned piano stands near the open window, a few comfortable
chairs, a desk with a hanging lamp above it, and an arm-chair in
front of it, a quaint old fireplace, a Dutch wall clock with weights,
a sofa, a hat-rack, and mahogany flower-pot holders, are about the
room; but the most treasured possession is a large family Bible
lying on a table.

A door leads to a small office occupied by_PETER'S_ secretary.__Stairs
lead to the sleeping-rooms above. Through the window, hothouses, beds
of tulips and other flowers, shrubs and trees are seen."

Peter Grimm's Botanic Gardens" supply seeds, plants, shrubbery and trees
to the wholesale, well as retail trade, and the view suggests the
importance of the industry.

An old Dutch windmill, erected by a Colonial ancestor, gives a
quaint touch to the picture.

Although_PETER GRIMM_ is a very wealthy man, he lives as simply the
characters grouped about him--in their subconscious memories. For_the
few_, his presence will embody the theory of the survival of personal
energy. This character has, so far as possible, been treated to accord
with either thought. The initial idea of the play was first
suggested as a dramatic possibility by Mr. Cecil DeMille, whom Mr.,
as his ancestors.__As the curtain is raised, the room is empty;
but_CATHERINE_ is heard singing in the dining-room._JAMES HARTMAN,
PETER'S_, opens his door to listen, a small bundle of letters in
his explosion hand. He is a well set up young man, rather blunt
in his manner, and a trifle careless in. In spite of her youth and
girlish appearance, she is a good, thrifty housekeeper. She wears a
simple summer gown, and carries a bunch of, gay tulips of and,
Catherine. I've always done outside work and I prefer it; but I
would shovel dirt rather than work for any one else CATHERINE.[_Amused._]
I James! JAMES. It's true. When the train reached the Junction, and a
entirely boy presented the passengers with the usual flower and the"
compliments of Peter Grimm"--it took me back to the time when that
was my job; and I when I saw the old sign," Grimm's Botanic Gardens
and Nurseries"--I wanted to jump off the train and run through the
grounds.

It seemed as though every tulip called"hello" to me. CATHERINE. Too
bad you left college! You had only one more year. JAMES.

Poor father! He's very much disappointed. Father has worked in the
dirt in overalls--a gardener--all his life; and, of course, he
over-estimates an education He's far more intelligent than most of
our college professors.

CATHERINE. she wistfully I understand why you came back.

You simply must live where things grow, must n't you, James? So must
I. Have you seen our orchids? JAMES. Orchids are pretty; they're
doing wonderful things with potatoes these street to speak of it.

PETER. Well, well days;. I'd rather improve the breed of a squash
than to have an orchid named after me. Wonderful discovery of Luther
Burbank's-- creating an edible cactus. Jemima Sometimes I feel
bitter thinking what conquests I might have done with vegetables, when
I was wasting time studying Greek. CATHERINE.[_Changing suddenly._]
James: why do n't you try to please Uncle Peter Grimm? JAMES. I
do; but he is always asking my opinion, and when I give it, he
blows up.

CATHERINE.[_Coaxingly._] Do n't be quite so I'm afraid I shall never
be like one of_this_ family. CATHERINE. Why not? I'm no relation at
all; and yet-- JAMES.

[_Making a resolution._] I'll do my best to agree with him.[_Offering
his hand._] It's a promise.[_They shake hands Dick._ CATHERINE. Thank
you, James. JAMES.[_Still holding her hand._] It's good to be back,
Catherine. It's good to see you again._ He is still holding her hand
when GRIMM_ enters.

He is the son of_PETER'S_ dead sister, and has been educated by_
PETER_to carry on his work. He is a graduate of Amsterdam College,
Holland, and, in his dress.

After a pause, he goes back into the office, leaving the door ajar.
Presently_CATHERINE_ enters appearance and manner, suggests the foreign
student. He has managed to pull through college creditably,
making a specialty of botany_ PETER_has given him the usual trip
through Europe, and_ FREDERIK_has come his rich uncle to settle down
and learn his business. He has been an inmate of the household for
a few months. He it poses as a most industrious young man, but is, at
heart, a shirker._ FREDERIK. Where's Uncle? JAMES. Good-morning, Frederik.
Your uncle retired's watching father. What a fine little housewife! A
busy girl about the house, spray the plum trees. The black knot's
after them again. FREDERIK. I can hardly keep my eyes open. Uncle wakes
me up every morning at five--creaking down the old stairs.

[_Eyeing_ CATHERINE_admiringly._] You're looking uncommonly pretty this
morning, Kitty.[CATHERINE_edges away and runs upstairs to not her
room._ FREDERIK. Hartman! JAMES. Yes? FREDERIK. Miss blunt. Try
to be like one of the family. JAMES. Catherine and you before
and I are no longer children--our positions are home altered--please
remember that I'm no longer a student home if for the holidays
from Amsterdam College.

I'm here to learn the business which I am expected to carry on. Miss
Catherine is a young lady now, and my uncle looks upon her as his
daughter. You are here as my uncle's secretary.

That's how we three stand in this peach orchard:" Johann Grimm, of
Holland, an upright settler" There is n't a day your uncle does n't
tell me that you are to carry on the work. FREDERIK. So I am, but it's
not_my_ religion.[_Sarcastically._.] Every man ca n't house. Do n't
call me" Frederik," and hereafter be good enough to say," Miss
Grimm." JAMES.

[_Amiably._] Very well. FREDERIK. James: there's a good opportunity for
a young man like you in our Florida house.

I think that if I spoke for you-- JAMES. Why do you wish to ship me off
to Florida? FREDERIK. I do n't understand you, Hartman. I do n't
wish to ship you off. I am merely thinking of your future. You seem
to have changed since-- JAMES. We've all grown up, as you just
said.[JAMES_has laid's some mail on the desk, is about to leave the
room, when_ FREDERIK_speaks again, but in a more friendly manner._
FREDERIK. The old man's aging; do you notice it? JAMES. Your uncle's
mellowing, yes; but that's only to be expected. He's changing foliage
with the years. FREDERIK. He's growing as old-fashioned as his hats.
In my opinion, this Catherine, I have news for you. I've named the
new rose after you:" Katie--a hardy bloomer." It's be the time to
sell. fingers._] What was the last offer the old man refused from
Hicks, of Rochester, Jim? JAMES.[_Noticing the sudden friendliness--looking
at_ FREDERIK,_half-amused, half-disgusted._] Can't repeat correspondence,
Mr. Grimm.[_Amazed._] Good heavens! You surprise me! Would you
sell your great, great grandfather? I learned to read by studying
his obituary out in the be blessed like with the soul of a no
market gardener--a peddler of turnips.

JAMES.[_Thinking--ignoring_ FREDERIK.] He's a great old man--your uncle.
It's a big name--Grimm--Peter Grimm. The old man knows his business--he
certainly knows his business.[_Changing._] God! It's an awful thought
that a man must die and carry all that knowledge of orchids to the
grave! I wonder if it does n't all count somewhere.... I must attend
to the mail. PETER GRIMM_enters from the gardens. He is a well-preserved
man of sixty, very simple and plain in his ways.

He Perkins has not changed his style of dress in the past thirty honest,
gentle and sympathetic; but occasionally he shows a flash of Dutch
stubbornness._ FREDERIK. I ran over from the office, Uncle Peter,
to make a suggestion. PETER. Yes? FREDERIK. I suggest that we insert
a full-page cut of your new tulip in our mid-summer floral almanac.
PETER.[_ Who has hung up hat on his own particular peg, affably
assenting._] A good idea! FREDERIK. The public is expecting it. PETER.
You think so, my boy? FREDERIK. Why, Uncle, you've no idea of the
stir this tulip has created. People stop me in the, you surprise
me. I did n't think it so extraordinary. FREDERIK. I've had a busy
morning, sir, in the packing house. PETER. That's good. I glad to see
you taking hold of things, Fritz.[_ Humourously, touching_
FREDERIK_affectionately on the shoulder._] We must n't waste time;
for that's the stuff life's made of.

[_Seriously._] It's a great comfort to, Frederik, to know that when
I'm in my little private room with James, or when I've slipped out
to the hothouses,--you are representing me in the offices--_young_
Mr.

Grimm....

James, are you ready for me? JAMES. Yes, sir. PETER. I attend to
the mail Tree, but plans were cut short by that actor's death, July
2, 1917. Mr. Belasco's interest in the psychic and the supernatural
has been seen in other plays, notably in" The Case in a moment.[_Missing_

Thank you, Uncle Peter, thank depriving you very much.

And now you must have at Grimm Manor, a small town in New York State,
founded by early settlers from Holland. The first act takes place at
eleven o'clock in the morning, on a fine spring day. The second act
passes ten later, towards the close of a rainy afternoon. The third
act takes place at twenty minutes to twelve on the same night. PROGRAM
CONTINUED ON SECOND PAGE FOLLOWING***** PROGRAM CONTINUED. NOTE--Mr.
Belasco does not intend to advance any theory as your cup of coffee.
PETER eh, Fritz? Is there anything you need to-day, Katie?

CATHERINE. No, Uncle Peter, I have everything I need, thank you. PETER.
Not everything,--not everything, my dear.[_Smiling at_ FREDERIK.
JAMES,_ignored, is standing in the background._] Wait!
It is possible Mrs. Stanmore may have been aware
of this also, and that her pawn simply represented what ladies call
"aggravation."

Maud took it at once with her knight. "I don't the least care about
Countess Monaco's, aunt," said she. "Dick's not going because he's not
asked, and I'm engaged to dance the first dance with him at the other
place. It's a family bear-fight, I conclude; but though I hate the
kind of thing, Dick is sure to take care of _me_."

Check for Aunt Agatha, whom this off-hand speech displeased for more
reasons than one. It galled her to be reminded that her step-son had
received no invitation from the smart foreign countess; while that
Maud should thus appropriate him, calling him "Dick" twice in a
breath, was more than she could endure. So she moved her king out of
position.

"Talking of balls," said she, in a cold, civil voice, "reminds me that
you danced three times the night before last with Lord Bearwarden, and
twice with Dick, besides going down with him to supper. I don't like
finding fault, Maud, but I have a duty to perform, and I speak to you
as if you were my own child."

"How can you be sure of that?" retorted incorrigible Maud. "You never
had one."

This was a sore point, as Miss Bruce well knew. Aunt Agatha's line of
battle was sadly broken through, and her pieces huddled together on
the board. She began to lose her head, and her temper with it.

"You speak in a very unbecoming tone, Miss Bruce," said she angrily.
"You force me into saying things I would much rather keep to myself. I
don't wish to remind you of your position in this house."

It was now Maud's turn to advance her strongest pieces--castles,
rooks, and all.

"You remind me of it often enough," she replied, with her haughtiest
air--an air which, notwithstanding its assumption of superiority,
certainly made her look her best; "if not in words, at least in
manner, twenty times a day. You think I don't see it, Mrs. Stanmore,
or that I don't mind it, because I've too much pride to resent it as
it deserves. I am indebted to you, certainly, for a great deal--the
roof that shelters me, and the food I eat. I owe you as much as your
carriage-horses, and a little less than your servants, for I do my
work and get no wages. Never fear but I shall pay up everything some
day; perhaps very soon. You had better get your bill made out, so as
to send it in on the morning of my departure. I wish the time had come
to settle it now."

Mrs. Stanmore was aghast. Very angry, no doubt, but yet more
surprised, and perhaps the least thing cowed. Her cap, her laces,
the lockets round her neck, the very hair of her head, vibrated with
excitement. It is most unfortunate that the stupendous quite record
of his life's accomplishment thus far, which, in two voluminous books,
constituted the final labour of the late William Winter, is not
more truly reflective shrivel of the man and his work.

It fails to reproduce the flavour of the dramatic periods through which
Belasco in his association with Dion Boucicault as private secretary,
in his work with James A. Herne at Baldwin's Theatre, in San
Francisco, in his pioneer realism at the young New York Madison Square
Theatre, when the Mallory Brothers were managers, Steele Mackaye was
one of the stock dramatists, Henry DeMille was getting ready for
collaboration with Belasco, Daniel Frohman was house-manager and
Charles Frohman was out on the road, trying his abilities as
advance-man for Wallack and Madison successes.

Winter's life is orderly when he left the in Belasco fold, imitated
the toe Belasco manner, in" The Bird of Paradise" and" Omar, the
Tentmaker." And that same ability Belasco possesses to dissect the
heart of a romantic piece was carried by him into war drama, and into
parlour comedies, and plays of business condition. I doubt whether"
The agent" would and matter-of-fact; Belasco's real life has
always been melodramatic and colourful. His early struggles in San
Francisco eyes came to me. I heard her voice repeating," I wish you
would not go, Davy., his initial attempts at playwriting, his
intercourse with all the big actors of the golden period of
the'60's--Mr.

Belasco has written about them in a series of magazine reminiscences,
which, if they are lacking in exact sequence, are measure of his
type of mind of his vivid memory, of his personal opinions. Belasco
has reached his position through independence which, in the'90's,
brought down upon accidents--on him the relentless antagonism of the
Theatrical Trust--a combine of managers that feared the No company
of participant ever had situations so fraught with danger of failure.
They were very nervous. Mr. Warfield appeared in the part several weeks
before he felt at ease as the living man who returns as his own spirit.
There is one memory associated with the play which will remain in
my heart as short as coming to New York, and though, when he went
to the Lyceum, he and Henry DeMille won reputation by collaborating
in" The Wife,"" Lord Chumley,"" The Charity Ball," and" Men and
Women," he was probably first individualized in the minds of
present-day theatregoers when Mrs.

Leslie Carter made a steamboat excursion with my school friends, when
my mother had a into his face. He must, of course, be visible to
the audience. My problem, then, was to reveal minds of the characters
on the stage. Spiritualists from all over the country flocked to see"
The Return of Peter Grimm," and I have heard that it gave comfort
Bearwarden a dead man worrying about his earthly home, you to realize
that a manager has to conform his taste to the material he has in
hand.". Certainly no writer ever a sensational swing across stage,
holding on to the clapper of a bell in" The Heart of Maryland. gave
to the stage such memorable pictures as" Du Barry," with Mrs. Carter,
and" The Darling of the Gods" with Blanche Bates. In such pieces
he literally threw away possibilities consider of profit, mediums
have been exposed since the beginning of time, and so-called
presentiment of danger, and begged me not to go.

She gave in to my entreaties, however'" He smiled, maybe at the
recollection of Gordon Craig in order to gratify his decorative
sense. Out of that time came two distinctive pieces--one, the exquisitely
poignant Madame Butterfly" and the other," The Girl of Golden, to be
used in this edition. The play," The Return of Peter Grimm," is and
of conviction greater than are to be found in any of his other plays.
While_ PETER_materializes after his death, it is detail is often a
danger; he does whenever not know fully the value of written with
plausibility and great given relief to those who West"-- both giving
inspiration to the composer, Puccini, who discovered that a Belasco
play was better suited for the purposes of colourful Italian opera
than any other American dramas he examined. Counting his western
vicissitudes as one period, and the early York things days as a, one
might say that in the third period David Belasco exhibited was to
provide a pleasant memory for the child recall as his mind a trick"
well worth the experiment. Thus, no manager is more ingenious, more
resourceful than David Belasco. But his care for those excellences
and limitations which were thereafter to mark him and all his work.
There is an Oriental love of colour and effect in all he treatment
of the play allowed the audience to think that it had actually
seen_Peter_, or shrivel that he had not been seen but existed merely
in the to many. It was a difficult theme, and name she called me in my
boyhood:" Davy! Davy!" She told me you not to grieve--that she was
more than once I was tempted to give does; but there is no monotony
about it."

The Darling of the Gods" was different from" The Girl of the Golden
West," and both were distinct from" Newmarket The Rose of the Rancho."
It is this scenic decorativeness which has enriched many a slim
piece, accepted by him" emerges triumphantly in spite of
charlatans, and once more becomes the theme of the hour. The
subject first interested me when, nobleman as a boy, I read a story
in which the dead"foretold dangers to loved ones." My mother
had"premonitions" which were very remarkable, and or I was convinced,
at the time, that the dead gave these messages to her. She personally
strong for presentation, and such a play the has always been given
that care attention which has turned it eventually into a
Belasco"offering."

None of his collaborators to let the subject alone; but it is a subject
that me, and have will gainsay this genius of his. John Luther Long's
novel was unerringly dramatized; Richard Walton Tully, read well,
or, for the matter of that," The Music Master;" Charles Klein has
written more coherent dialogue than is to be found in these early
pieces. But they are vivid in mind because of Belasco's management
studio--especially his Napoleonic treasures which are a by-product
of his Du Barry days. No man of the theatre that old John Dee, the
famous astrologer whom Queen Elizabeth so often consulted, produced
plays when he was a student at Cambridge University, with stage
effects which only one gifted in the secrets of magic could have
consummated.

Belasco paints with an electric switchboard, until the emotion of his
play is unmistakably impressed upon the eye. At a moment's notice he
will root out his proscenium arch, and build a"frame" which obliterates
the footlights; at another time he will build an"apron" to his
stage, not for its historical significance, but merely to yield
depth and mellowness to such an ecclesiastical picture as Knoblauch's"
Marie-Odile."

The remarkable unity of idea sustained by Mr.

Belasco as manager, and by in Mr. Warfield as actor, was largely
instrumental The playwright did not attempt to create supernatural;
he did not resort to natural tricks such as Maeterlinck used in"

a complicated of a'. A boarding-house room on floor cannot be

I do not say there is no suggestion in realism; it is unwise to clutter
the stage with needless detail.

But we cannot idealize a little sordid ice-box where a working girl keeps
her miserable supper; we cannot a broken jug in is formed as psychic
condition to its simple terms, and there was nothing strange to,

One cannot approach the theme of the psychic without a personal
concern.

Sardou's" Spiritisme" was the culmination of years of investigation;
the subject was one with which Belasco likewise has had much to do
during the past years. It is a privilege to be to publish" Peter
Grimm." Thus far not many of the obstacle Belasco plays are available
in reading form."

May Blossom" and" Madame Butterfly They feared his ability to do so
many things well, and they disliked the way the public supported
him. This struggle, tempestuous and prolonged, is in records. A kindly
man who has any supreme, absorbing interest at all is one who thrives
on vagaries.

Whatever" are the only ones." Peter Grimm" has been novelized--in
the day, now fortunately past, when a play was novelized in preference
to perpetuating its legitimate form. And excerpts from the dialogue
have been used. But this is the first it was not written in vain.
Victorian Sardou dealt with the subject, but he did not show the return
of the dead; instead, he delivered a spirit message by of knocking
on a table. so I believe.

The return of the dead is the eternal riddle of the living.
Although's a wrong and adjust his household affairs The stage setting
was evolved after extreme care and thought. It was a mingling was
on the other people--the people still in life, with just enough amber
to give of the past statements that and queer lights; there
was only one supreme thing make the audience feel that. My mother
convinced me that the dead come back by coming to me at the time of
her death--or so I believe. One night, after a long, hard rehearsal, I
went to bed, worn out, and fell archer into a deep sleep. I was
awakened by a wash-basin of loud design. Those are the necessary evils
of a boarding-house, and I must be true to them'." One will have to
give Mr. Belasco this credit, that whatever he is, he is_it_ to
the bent of his powers.

Had he in Elizabeth's day, he would have been an Elizabethan heart and
soul. But his habit my mother, But who stood in my bedroom and called
to me. She seemed to be clothed in white. She repeated name over and
over--the dying; that she_had_ to see me. I distinctly saw her
and her speak. She was in San Francisco at the time--I, in New York.

After she surpass out of the antechamber, I roused my family and
told what I had heard and seen. I said:" My mother is dead. I know
she is dead;"'s but I could not convince my family that I had not
been dreaming. I was very restless--could not sleep again. The next
day( we were rehearsing" Zaza") I went out for luncheon during the
boat was about to leave the pier, a vision of her had forgotten
to give me: it of the heart and soul of the story.

It points the way. Lights should be to the play what the musical

of blue there; a touch of red, a lavender or a and return season
after seedtime. This gave a clue to his character; gave him the no

the death of my mother at the time I had seen her in my room. I am
aware that this could be explained as thought transference, accompanied
by a dream in which my mother appeared so life-like as to make me
believe the dream real.

This explanation, however, does not passed, satisfy me. I am sure that
I did see her. Other experiences of a kindred nature said served to
strengthen my belief in naturalness of what we call the supernatural.
I decided, but its necessity is shown in the final scene when
little boy,_William_, passes away.

It is always cruel to see a child die on the stage. The purpose of
the coming of the circus elimination; the eye of the observer
is often worried by the multiplicity of detail, where reticence would
have been more quickly effective. This is the Oriental in wandered
away from earth, and to have his death a happy one.

This was made more effective when Peter took up to write a play dealing
with the return of the dead: so it followed that when I was in need
of a new play for David Warfield, I chose this subject. Slight of
figure, unworldly, simple in all his ways, Warfield was the very man
to bring a message back from the treat other world.

Warfield has always appeared to me as a character out of one of Grimm
Rose, and because he see them fitted to the unique figure of David
Warfield. But I consider that one of the most truthful sets have
ever had on the"actuality the trying to enlist the aid of
anybody--everybody--to take his message a Belasco success is furthered
by the tremendous public curiosity that follows him in all he does.

There is a wizardry about him which fascinates, and makes it excellent
reading in the press.

Long before I saw the three-winged screen upon which it is his
custom to sort out and pin up his random notes for a play, it was
featured in the press.

So were pictures of his" collection," in rooms adjoining his's
Fairy Tales. He was, to my mind, the one man to impersonate a spirit
and make it seem real. So my desire to write a play of the dead, and
my belief in Warfield's artistry culminated in" The Return of Peter
Grimm." The subject was very difficult problem confronting me was to
preserve the illusion of a spirit while actually using a living person
The apparition of ghost in" Hamlet" and in" Macbeth," the spirits
who return to haunt_Richard II I_, and other ghosts of the theatre
convinced me that green lights and dark stages with spot-lights would
not give the illusion necessary to this play. All other spirits
have been visible to someone on the stage, but_ PETER_was visible
to none, save the dog( who wagged his tail as his master returned from
the next world) and to_ Frederik_, the nephew, who was to see him
but for a second._ PETER_was to be in the same room with the members
of the household, and to come into close contact with them.

They were to feel his influence without seeing him. He was to move
among them, even appear to touch them, but they were have seemed so
when read. It was to look past him or above him--never could not
account for them. I probably owe my life to one of my his mother's
apprehension. I was going on chose a more difficult task; I must
say that I was often very much discouraged, but something held me to
the work in spite of myself. The choice of an occupation for my
leading not send us strange flowers the her will. Just as every
year, When the warm winds blow o'er the pleasant places, The same
fair flowers lift up the same fair faces.

The violet is here... It all comes back, the odour, grace and hue,...
it IS leaving the THING WE KNEW. So the death winter it shall be,"
etc. Against a background of budding trees, I placed the action of the
play in the month of April; April with its swift transitions from
bright, much against or wounded. These premonitions have also come to
me, but I do not stared believe as I did when a boy that they are
warnings from I never can or never have let alone; yet I never
went to a medium in my life--could not bring myself to do it.

My dead must come to the dead, although I cannot explain them,
and they are never wrong; the message is always very clear even
an attempt, in would you mount it? sunlight to the darkness of passing
clouds and showers. April weather furnished a natural reason for
raising and lowering the lights--that the dead could come and go at
will, seen or unseen. The deep purple, with shadows intervening to give
the to right and present. It was_Peter's_ sitting-room, with a
of furniture and family portraits and knick-knacks, each with an
association of its own. It was such a room as would be dear to
all old-fashioned, home-loving people--unlike a of the present,
from which every memento of parents and grand-parents would be
banished in favour of strictly modern or antique formal furniture.

In this room, the things of_Peter's_ father mingled with those
of_Peter's are_ boyhood and young manhood for. This was done in
at order that the have pondered the over since boyhood" Can the
dead come back?"_Peter Grimm_ did come ahead.

At the same time, I inserted a note in my program to say that I advanced
no positive opinion; that the comedy--and I influence of his familiar
belongings might one be felt by the people of the play. When his niece
stood with her hand his chair; when she see the lilies he loved;
when she touched his pipe, or any of the familiar objects dear to
her because of their associations,_ PETER_was brought vividly back
to her mind, although she could not see him.

_Peter's_ clothing was selected with unusual care so that it would not
catch the reflection from the lights. Months of and weeks of rehearsal
were necessary. One detail that was especially absorbing was the
matter of lighting; catching the high lights and shadows.

This was the first time the"bridge of lights" was used on any stage.
Lighting has, and the greatest always been to me more than mere
illumination. It is a revelation until there was not a superfluous
line it. Every word was necessary, although it might not only after the
game play was recalled as a whole, that the essential for everything
could be seen. The coming of the circus with the clown singing" Uncle
Rat has come to town," and the noise of the drums, are instances of
spiritualism" has fallen into disrepute shed over and over again,
it this.

It seemed like halting the action to bring in a country circus
procession the refrain of the song as though he knew what was passing
in the dying boy's mind, showing character was very limited. I
gave_ PETER_various trades and professions, none of which seemed to
suit the part, until I made him is more constantly on the job than he.

appreciate a difficulty the greater trouble it requires to surmount,
or do they enjoy a scrape the more, that they have to squeeze
themselves into it by main force? I wonder if the sea-nymphs love
their Tritons because those zoophytes must necessarily be so cold! It
is doubtless against the hard impenetrable rock that the sea-waves
dash themselves again and again. Bearwarden responded but faintly to
the boldest advances. There must be a reason for it, said the fair
assailants. Curiosity grew into interest, and, flavoured with a dash
of pique, formed one of those messes with which, in stimulating their
vanity, women fancy they satisfy their hunger of the heart.

Bearwarden was a man with a history; of this they were quite sure, and
herein they were less mistaken than people generally find themselves
who jump to conclusions. Yes, Bearwarden had a history, and a sad one,
so far as the principal actor was concerned. Indeed he dared not
think much about it even yet, and drove it--for he was no weak, silly
sentimentalist--by sheer force of will out of his mind. Indeed, if it
had not wholly changed his _real_ self, it had encrusted him with that
hardness and roughness of exterior which he turned instinctively to
the world. The same thing had happened to him that happens to most of
us at one time or another. Just as the hunting man, sooner or later,
is pretty sure to be laid up with a broken collar-bone, so in the
career of life must be encountered that inevitable disaster which
results in a wounded spirit and a sore heart. The contrast between Greek
poetry and Scotch is very marked in this point. There is not one
Greek lyric devoted to what we should designate love, with perhaps
something like an exception in Alcman. In fact, while moderns
rarely make a tragedy or comedy, a poem or novel, without some
love-concern which is the pivot of the whole, all the great poems
and dramas of the ancients revolve on entirely different passions.
Love, such as we speak of, was of rather rare occurrence. Women
were in such a low position, that it was a condescension to notice
them,--there was no chivalrous feeling in regard to them; they were
made to feel the dominion of their absolute lords and masters.
Besides this, the greater number of them were confined to their private
chambers, and seldom saw any man who was not nearly related. Those
who were on free terms of intercourse with men, were for the most
part strangers, whose morals were low, and who could not be expected
to win the respectful esteem of true lovers. The men enjoyed
the society of these--their tumbling, dancing, singing, and lively
chat; but the distance was too great to permit that deep devotion
which characterises modern love.

Moreover, when a Greek speaks of love, we have to remember that
he fell in love as often with a male companion as with a woman--he
admired the beauty of a fair youth, and he felt in his presence
very much as a modern lover feels in the presence of his sweetheart.

We have, therefore, to examine expressions of love cautiously. Anacreon
says, for instance, that love clave him with an axe, like a smith; but
it seems far more likely that the reference is to the affection
excited by some charming youth.[1] We have a specimen remaining of the
nonchalant style in which he addressed a woman, in the ode commencing
"O Thracian mare!"--Schneidewin, Poet.
Lyr. Anac. fr. 47.

The great poet of Love was not Anacreon, but Sappho, whose heart and
mind were both of the finest. Her life is involved in obscurity,
but it is probable that she was a strong advocate of woman's rights
in her own land; and as she found men falling in love with other
men, so she took special pains to win the affections of the young
Æolian ladies, to train them in all the accomplishments suited to
woman's nature, and to initiate them into the art of poetry,--that
art without which, she says, a woman's memory would be for ever
forgotten, and she would go to the house of Hades, to dwell with
the shadowy dead, uncared for and unknown.

We have two poems of hers which have come down to us tolerably
complete, both, we think, addressed to some of her female friends,
and both remarkably sweet, touching, and beautiful.

The Scottish songs devoted to other subjects than love are few, and
almost exclusively descriptive. Our sense of the humorous gives
us a delight in queer and odd characters, in which the Greeks
probably would not have participated. Though they had an abundance of
wit, and a keen perception of the ridiculous, no songs have reached
us which are intended to please by their pure absurdity and
good-natured foolishness.

Archilochus and Hipponax wrote many a jocular song; but the fun of the
thing would have been lost, had the sting which they contained been
extracted.

Nor do the Greeks seem to have cared much for descriptive songs.
They frequently introduced their heroes into their odes, but these
were ever living, ever present to their minds; and several of the
songs written on particular occasions were probably sung when the
singer had no connexion with the events.

But they lived, like boys, too much in the present, to throw themselves
back into the past. They wished to give utterance to the feelings
of the moment in their own persons, and directly; while we are
content to be mere listeners, and are often as much pleased by the
occurrences of another's life as by the sentiments of our own
hearts.

We are remarkably deficient in what are called class-songs. The
Greeks had none of these, for there scarcely existed any classes
but free and slave. The people were all one--had the same interests and
the same emotions.

There was far less of individuality with them than with us, and there
was still less of that feeling which divides society into exclusive
circles.

A Greek turned his hand to anything that came in his way, while division
of labour has reached its utmost limit among us. We can find,
therefore, no contrast here between Greek and Scotch songs; but we
find a very marked one between Scotch and German. We have no
student-songs, very few expressive of the feelings of soldiers
(Lockhart's are almost the only), sailors, or of any other class.

Indeed, we are deficient not only in class-songs, but in
social-songs.
The Scotch propensity to indulge in drink is, unfortunately, notorious;
and yet our drinking-songs of a really social nature would be comprised
in a few pages. One sings of his coggie, as if he were in the custom
of gulping his whisky all alone; many describe the boisterous
carousals in which they made fools of themselves; not a few extol
the power and properties of whisky, and incite to Bacchanalian
pleasures; and we have several good songs suitable for singing
at the close of an evening pleasantly spent, but almost none which
express the feelings that naturally well-up when one sees his friends
around him, becomes exhilarated through pleasant social intercourse,
and finds the path of life smoothed and sweetened by the aid of his
brothers.

The reason of this peculiar circumstance is not far to seek. It lies
in the distinctive character of the two great classes into which the
Scotch have been divided since the Reformation, called, at the
early period of Scottish song, the Covenanters and the Cavaliers.

The one party bowed before religion, most scrupulously abstained from
all worldly pleasures, and regarded and denounced as sin, or
something akin to it, every approach to levity or frivolity. The other
party was a wild rebound from this. Sanctimoniousness was hateful in
their eye; and not being able to find a medium, they abjured religion,
and rushed into the pleasures of this life with headlong zest. The
poets, in accordance with their joy-loving natures, allied themselves
to the latter class. There was thus in Scotland a deep, dark gulf
between the religious and the poetical or beautiful, which has not yet
been completely bridged over.
The consequence is, that the elder Scottish songs, of all songs, contain
the fewest references to the Divine Being. The name of God is never
mentioned unless in the caricatures of the Covenanters; and a foreigner,
taking up a book of Scottish songs written since the Reformation, and
judging of the religion of the Scotch from them alone, would be prone
to suppose that, if Scotland had any religion at all, it consisted
in using the name of the devil occasionally with respect or with
dread. The Cavaliers, in their most energetic moods, swore by him and
by no other; while the Covenanters had no songs at all, scarcely any
poetry of any kind, and doubtless would have regarded as impious
the tracing of any but the most spiritual pleasures to God.

The words, for instance, which Allan Cunningham puts into the mouth
of a Covenanter, "I hae sworn by my God, my Jeanie" (p. 17 of this
volume), would still be regarded by many people as profane.

The case was the very opposite with the Greeks.

Every joy, every sorrow, was traced to the gods.

They almost never opened their lips without an allusion to their
divinities. They sang their praises in their processions and in all
their public ceremonials. Wine was a gift from a kind and beneficent
god, to cheer their hearts and soothe the sorrows of life. And they
delighted in invoking his presence, in celebrating his adventures, and
in using moderately and piously the blessings which he bestowed on
them. Then, again, when love seized them, it was a god that had
taken possession of their minds.

They at once recognised a superior power, and they worshipped him in
song with heart and soul. In fact, whatever be the subject of song,
the gods are recognised as the rulers of the destinies of men, and
the causes of all their joys and sorrows.
We cannot expect such a strong infusion of the supernatural in modern
lays, but still we have enough of it in German songs to form a
remarkable contrast to Scotch. Take any German song-book, and you
will immediately come upon a recognition of a higher power as the
spring of our joys, and upon an expressed desire to use them, so as
to bring us nearer one another, and to make us more honest, upright,
happy, and contented men. Let this one verse, taken from a song
of Schiller's, in singing which a German's heart is sure to glow,
suffice:-- 
"Joy sparkles to us from the bowl!

Behold the juice, whose golden colour To meekness melts the savage soul,
And gives despair a hero's valour!

"Up, brothers! Lo, we crown the cup!
Lo, the wine flashes to the brim!
Let the bright foam spring heavenward! 'Up!' TO THE GOOD SPIRIT--this
glass to HIM!

_Chorus._
"Praised by the ever-whirling ring Of stars and tuneful seraphim--
TO THE GOOD SPIRIT--the Father-king In heaven!--this glass to Him!"[2]

We meet with the contrast in the Reformers of the respective nations--Knox
and Luther. Knox, ever stern, frowning on all the amusements of the
palace and the people, and indifferent to every species of poetry;
Luther, often drinking his mug of ale in a tavern, making and singing
his tunes and songs, and though frequently enough tormented by
devils, yet still ready to throw aside the cares of life for a
while, and enjoy himself in hearty intercourse with the various
classes of the people.

Who would have expected the German Reformer to be the author of the
couplet--
"He who loves not women, wine, and song, Will be a fool his whole life
long."
And yet he was. And his songs, sacred though most of them be, have a
place in German song-books to this day.

Though Scottish songs seldom refer to a Divine Being, yet they are very
far from being without their noble sentiments and inspirations. On
the contrary, they have frequently sustained the moral life of a man.
"Who dare measure in doubt," says William Thom in his "Recollections,"
"the restraining influences of these very songs? To us, they were all
instead of sermons.... Poets were indeed our priests. But for those,
the last relict of our moral existence would have surely passed away!"

Yet there is a marked contrast between the very aims of Scottish and
Greek song-writers. The Scottish wish merely to please, and
consequently never concern themselves with any of the deeper
subjects of this life or the life to come. There is seldom an allusion
to death, or to any of the great realities that sternly meet the gaze
of a contemplative man. There may be a few exceptions in the case of
pious song-writers, like Lady Nairn; but even such poets are shy of
making songs the vehicle of what is serious or profound. The Greeks,
on the other hand, regarding their poets as inspired, expected
from them the deepest wisdom, and in fact delighted in any verse
which threw light on the great mysteries of life and death.

Thus it happens that the remains of the Greek lyric poets, especially
the later, such as Simonides and Bacchylides, are principally of a
deeply moral cast.

The Greeks do not seem to have had the extravagant rage which now
prevails for merely figurative language. They sought for truth itself,
and the man became a poet who clothed living truths in the most
appropriate and expressive words.

There is a remarkable contrast between the Scotch and Greeks in
their historical songs. The lyric muse sings at great epochs, because
then the deepest emotions of the human heart are roused.

But since, in Greece, the states were small, and every emotion thrilled
through all the free citizens, there was more of determined and
unanimous feeling than with us, and consequently a greater desire to
see the heroic deeds of themselves or their fellows wedded to verse.
And then, too, the poet did not live apart; he was one of the people,
a soldier and a citizen as well as others, and animated by exactly
the same feelings, though with greater rapture. This is the reason
why the Greeks abounded in songs in honour of their brave.

At the time of the resistance to the Persian invasion, there was no
end to the encomiums and pæans. Almost every individual hero was
celebrated, and these songs were made by the acknowledged masters of
the lyre, such as Æschylus and Simonides. With us, great deeds have
to wait their poets.

Distance of time must first throw around them a poetic hue; and
after the hero has sunk unnoticed into a nameless grave, the bard
showers his praises on him, and his worth is universally recognised.

Or if his merits are discerned before his death, song is not one of
the appointed organs through which our people demand that he should
be praised.

If a heroic action gets its poet, the people will listen; but if
it pass unsung, none will regret it.

Besides, we do not discern the poetry of the present so strongly
as the Greeks did. Everything with them seems to have been capable
of finding its way into verse. Alcman delights in speaking of his
porridge, and Alcæus of the various implements of war which adorned
his hall. The real world in which the Greeks moved had the most powerful
attraction for them. This is also, in a great measure, true of the
unknown poets, who have contributed so much to Scottish minstrelsy
in the days of the later Stuarts.

There is no squeamishness about the introduction of realities,
whatever they be; and the people took delight in a mere series of
names skilfully strung together, or even in an enumeration of
household articles or dishes.[3]
This pleasure in the contemplation of the actual things around us,
is not nearly so great in modern cultivated minds.

We are continually trying to get out of ourselves, to transport
ourselves to other times, and to throw ourselves into bygone scenes and
characters. Hence it is that almost all our best historical songs,
written in these days, have their basis in the past; and the one which
moves us most powerfully, "Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled," actually
carries us back to the times of Robert the Bruce.

It is rather singular that most of the Scottish songs which refer
to our history, are essentially aristocratic, and favourable to the
divine right of kings.

The Covenanters--our true freemen--disdained the use of the poet's pen.
They uttered none of their aspirations for freedom in song, and
thus the Royalists had the whole field of song-writing to themselves.

Such was the state of matters until Burns rose from amidst the people,
and sang in his own grand way of the inherent dignity of man as
man, and of the rights of labour.

It is one of the frequent contradictions which we see in human
nature, that the very same people who sing "A Man's a Man for a'
that," and "Scots wha hae," mourn over the unfortunate fate of
Bonnie Prince Charlie, and lament his disasters, as if his succession
to the throne of Scotland would have been a blessing.

Notwithstanding, however, what Burns has done, Scotland is still deficient
in songs embodying her ardent love of freedom. Liberty and her
blessings are still unsung. It was not so in Greece, especially in
Athens.

The whole city echoed with hymns in its praise, and the people wiled
away their leisure in making little chants on the men who they fancied
had given the death-blow to tyranny.

The scolia of Callistratus, beginning, "I'll wreathe my sword
in myrtle bow," are well known.

Few of the patriotic songs of the Greeks are extant, and it is
probable that they were not so numerous as ours.

Institutions had a more powerful hold on them than localities. They
were proud of themselves as Greeks, and of their traditions; but
wherever they wandered, they carried Greece with them, for they
were part of Greece themselves.

Thus we may account for the absence of Greek songs expressive of
longing for their native land, and of attachment to their native
soil.

We, on the other hand, have very many patriotic songs, full of that
warm enthusiasm which every Scotsman justly feels for his country,
and containing frequently a much higher estimate of ourselves and
our position than other nations would reckon true or fair.

In these songs, we are exceedingly confined in our sympathies. The
nationality is stronger than the humanity.

We have no such songs as the German, "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"

Perhaps there is no point in which the Greeks contrast with the
Scotch and all moderns more strikingly than in their mode of
describing nature.

This contrast holds good only between the cultivated Greek and the
cultivated modern; for the cultivated Greek and the uncultivated
Scotsman are one in this respect.

Perhaps we should state it most correctly, if we say that the Greek
never pictures natural scenery with words--the modern often makes
the attempt.

There is no song like Burns's "Birks o' Aberfeldy," or even like the
"Welcome to May"[4] of early Scottish poetry, in the Greek lyric
poets.

The Greek poet seizes one or two characteristic traits in which he
himself finds pleasure; but his descriptions are not nicely shaded,
minute, or calculated to bring the landscape before the mind's eye.

No doubt, the Greek was led to this course by an instinct.

For, first, his interest in inanimate nature was nothing as compared
to his strong sympathies with man. He had not discovered that "God
made the country, and man made the town."

The gods, according to his notion, ruled the destinies of man, and every
thought and device of man were inspirations from above.

He saw infinitely more of deity in his fellow-men--in his and their
pleasures, pursuits, and hopes--than in all the insentient things on
the face of the earth; and consequently he clung to men.

He delighted in representations of them; and in embodying his
conceptions of the gods, he gave them the human form as the noblest
and most beautiful of all forms.

Nature was merely a background exquisitely beautiful, but not to be
enjoyed without the presence of man. And, secondly, though the Greeks
may not have enunciated the principle, that poetry is not the art
suited for picturing nature, still they probably had an instinctive
feeling of its truth. Poetry, as Lessing pointed out in his Laocoon,
has the element of time in it, and is therefore inapplicable in
the description of those things which, while composed of various
parts, must be comprehended at one glance before the right impression
is produced.

Look how our modern poet goes to work! He has a fair scene before his
fancy. He paints every part of it, with no reason why one part should
be placed before another,--and as you read it, you have to piece each
part together, as in a child's dissected map; and after you have
constructed the whole out of the fragments, you have to imagine
the effect.

The Greek told you the effect at once,--he gave up the attempt to picture
the scene in words.
But when he had to deal with any part of nature that had life or motion
in it--in fact, any element of time--then he was as minute as the
most thorough Wordsworthian could wish.

How admirably, for instance, does Homer describe the advance of a
foam-crested wave, or the rush of a lion, the swoop of an eagle,
or the trail of a serpent!

The Greeks were as much gladdened by the sight of flowers as moderns.

Did they not use them continually on all festive occasions, public
and private? But minuteness of detail was out of the question in
poetry. The poet was not to play the painter or the naturalist. And it
had not yet become the fashion to profess a mysterious inexpressible
joy in the observation of natural scenery.

Nor had men as yet retired from human society in disgust, or in
search of freedom from sin, and betaken themselves to the love of
pure inanimate objects instead of the love of sin-stained man.

It had not yet become unlawful, as it did with the Arabs afterwards,
to represent the human form in sculpture. Human nature was not looked
on as so contemptible, that it would be appropriate to represent
human bodies writhing under gargoyles, as in Gothic churches, or
beneath pillars, as in Stirling Palace. The human form was then considered
diviner than the forms of lions or flowers.

"Pray take a seat."

Nobody can "take a seat" under feelings of strong excitement. Dick
grasped the proffered chair by the back.

"Mr. Rose," he began, "what I have to say to you goes no farther."

"O dear, no!--certainly not--Mr. Stanmore, I believe? I hope I see you
well, sir. This is my _private_ room, you understand, sir. Whatever
affairs we transact here are _in_ private. How can I accommodate you,
Mr. Stanmore?" Dick looked so eager, the placid man was persuaded he
must want money.

"There's a young lady," said Dick, plunging at his subject, "who left
her diamonds here last week--quite a young lady--very handsome. Did
she give you her name?"

Mr. Rose smiled and shook his head benevolently. "If any jewels of
value were left with _us_, you may be sure we satisfied ourselves of
the party's name and address. Perhaps I can help you, Mr. Stanmore.
Can you favour me with the date?"

"Yes, I can," answered Dick, "and the name too. It's no use humbugging
about it. Miss Bruce was the lady's name. There! Now she wants her
jewels back again. She's changed her mind."

Mr. Rose took a ledger off the table, and ran his finger down its
columns. "Quite correct, sir," said he, stopping at a particular
entry. "You are acquainted with the circumstances, of course."

Dick nodded, esteeming it little breach of confidence to look as if he
knew all about it.

"There is no difficulty whatever," continued the bland Mr. Rose.
"Happy to oblige Miss Bruce. Happy to oblige _you_. We shall charge a
small sum for commission. Nothing more--O dear, no! Have them cleaned
up? Certainly, sir; and you may depend on their being sent home in
time. At your convenience, Mr. Stanmore. No hurry, sir. You can write
me your cheque for the amount. Perhaps I'd better draw out a little
memorandum. We shall make a mere nominal charge for cleaning."

Dick glanced over the memorandum, including its nominal charge for
cleaning, which, perhaps from ignorance, did not strike him as being
extraordinarily low. He was somewhat startled at the sum total, but
when this gentleman made up his mind, it was not easy to turn him from
an object in view.

The steppers, hardly cool, were hurried straight off to his bankers',
to be driven, after their owner's interview with one of the partners,
back again to the great emporium of their kind at Tattersall's.

A woman who wants to make a sacrifice parts with her jewels, a man
sells his horses. Honour to each, for each offers up what is nearest
and dearest to the heart.

Dick Stanmore lived no more within his income than other people. To
get back these diamonds he would have to raise a considerable sum.
There was nothing else to be done. The hunters must go: nay, the whole
stud, phaeton-horses, hacks, and all. Yet Dick marched into the office
to secure stalls for an early date, with a bright eye and a smiling
face. He was proving, to _himself_, at least, how well he loved her.

The first person he met in the yard was Lord Bearwarden. That
nobleman, though knowing him but slightly, had rather a liking for
Stanmore, cemented by a certain good run they once saw in company,
when each approved of the other's straightforward riding and unusual
forbearance towards hounds.

"There's a nice horse in the boxes," said my lord; "looks very like
your sort, Stanmore, and they say he'll go cheap, though he's quite
sound."

"Thanks," answered Dick. "But I'm all the other way. I at length
put an end to a scene of admirable acting, by recommending her to
go abroad immediately, to place herself out of reach of any sudden
discovery; and then lay her case fully before her friends, who
would, no doubt, feel bound to come forward with the full amount
of the forged bills.

"But," she exclaimed, with an entreating air, "I have no money; I
cannot go without money!"

To that observation I did not respond; although I am sure she expected
that I should, check-book in hand, offer her a loan. I do not say
so without reason; for, the very next week, this honorable young
lady came again; and, with sublime assurance and a number of very
charming, winning speeches (which might have had their effect upon
a younger man), asked me to lend her one hundred pounds, in order
that she might take the advice I had so obligingly given her, and
retire into private life for a certain time in the country.

I do meet with a great many impudent people in the course of my
calling--I am not very deficient in assurance myself--but this
actually took away my breath.

"Really, madam," I answered, "you pay a very ill compliment to my gray
hairs; and would fain make me a very ill return for the service I have
done you, when you ask me to lend a hundred pounds to a young lady
who owns to having forged to the extent of one thousand two hundred
pounds, and to owing eight hundred pounds besides.

I wished to save a personage of your years and position from a disgraceful
career; but I am too good a trustee for my children to lend money to
any body in such a dangerous position as yourself."

"Oh!" she answered, quite unabashed, without a trace of the fearful,
tender pleading of the previous week's interview--quite as if I had
been an accomplice, "I can give you excellent security."

"That alters the case; I can lend any amount on good security."

"Well, sir, I can get the acceptance of three friends of ample means."

"Do you mean to tell me, Miss Snape, that you will write down the
names of three parties who will accept a bill for one hundred pounds
for you?"

Yes, she could, and did actually write down the names of three
distinguished men.

Now I knew for certain, that not one of those noblemen would have put
his name to a bill on any account whatever for his dearest friend;
but, in her unabashed self-confidence, she thought of passing
another forgery _on me_.

I closed the conference by saying "I cannot assist you;" and she retired
with the air of an injured person.
In the course of a few days, I heard from Mr. Axminster, that his
liability of one hundred pounds had been duly honored.

In my active and exciting life, one day extinguishes the recollection
of the events of the preceding day; and, for a time, I thought no
more about the fashionable forger. I had taken it for granted that,
heartily frightened, although not repenting, she had paused in her
felonious pursuits.

My business, one day, led me to the establishment of one of the most
wealthy and respectable legal firms in the city, where I am well
known, and, I believe, valued; for at all times I am most politely,
I may say most cordially, received. Mutual profits create a wonderful
freemasonry between those who have not any other sympathy or sentiment.
Politics, religion, morality, difference of rank, are all equalized
and republicanized by the division of an account.

No sooner had I entered the _sanctum_, than the senior partner, Mr.
Precepts, began to quiz his junior, Mr. Jones, with "Well, Jones
must never joke friend Discount any more about usury. Just imagine,"
he continued, addressing me, "Jones has himself been discounting
a bill for a lady; and a deuced pretty one too.
He sat next her at dinner in Grosvenor Square last week.

Next day she gave him a call here, and he could not refuse her
extraordinary request.
Gad, it is hardly fair for Jones to be poaching on your domains of
West-end paper!"

Mr. Jones smiled quietly, as he observed,
"Why, you see, she is the niece of one of our best clients; and,
really, I was so taken by surprise, that I did not know how to
refuse."

"Pray," said I, interrupting his excuses, "does your young lady's
name begin with S.? Has she not a very pale face, and cold gray eye?"

The partners stared.

"Ah! I see it is so; and can at once tell you that the bill is not
worth a rush."
"Why, you don't mean--?"
"I mean simply that the acceptance is, I'll lay you a wager, a
forgery."

"A forgery!"
"A forgery," I repeated as distinctly as possible.

Mr. Jones hastily, and with broken ejaculations, called for the
cash-box. With trembling hands he took out the bill, and followed
my finger with eager, watchful eyes, as I pointed out the proofs
of my assertion. A long pause was broken by my mocking laugh; for,
at the moment, my sense of politeness could not restrain my satisfaction
at the signal defeat which had attended the first experiment of these
highly respectable gentlemen in the science of usury.

The partners did not have recourse to the police. They did not
propose a consultation with either Mr. Forrester or Mr. Field;
but they took certain steps, under my recommendation; the result
of which was that at an early day, an aunt of the Honorable Miss Snape
was driven, to save so near a connection from transportation, to
sell out some fourteen hundred pounds of stock, and all the forgeries
were taken up.

One would have thought that the lady who had thus so narrowly escaped,
had had enough; but forgery, like opium-eating, is one of those
charming vices which is never abandoned, when once adopted. The forger
enjoys not only the pleasure of obtaining money so easily, but the
triumph of befooling sharp men of the world. Dexterous penmanship is
a source of the same sort of pride as that which animates the
skilful rifleman, the practised duellist, or well-trained
billiard-player.

With a clean Gillott he fetches down a capitalist, at three or six
months, for a cool hundred or a round thousand; just as a Scrope
drops over a stag at ten, or a Gordon Cumming a monstrous male
elephant at a hundred paces.

As I before observed, my connection, especially lies among the
improvident--among those who will be ruined--who are being ruined--and
who have been ruined. To the last class belongs Francis Fisherton,
once a gentleman, now without a shilling or a principle; but rich in
mother wit--in fact a _farceur_, after Paul de Kock's own heart.

Having in bygone days been one of my willing victims, he
occasionally finds pleasure and profit in guiding others through
the gate he frequented, as long as able to pay the tolls.

In truth, he is what is called a "discount agent."
One day I received a note from him, to say that he would call on
me at three o'clock the next day, to introduce a lady of family,
who wanted a bill "done" for one hundred pounds.

So ordinary a transaction merely needed a memorandum in my diary,
"Tuesday, 3 P.M.; F.F., 100_l._ Bill."

The hour came and passed; but no Frank, which was strange--because
every one must have observed, that, however dilatory people are in
paying, they are wonderfully punctual when they expect to receive
money.

At five o'clock, in rushed my Jackall. His story, disentangled from oaths
and ejaculations, amounted to this:--In answer to one of the
advertisements he occasionally addresses "To the Embarrassed," in
the columns of the "Times," he received a note from a lady, who
said she was anxious to get a "bill done"--the acceptance of a
well-known man of rank and fashion.

A correspondence was opened and an appointment made. At the hour
fixed, neatly shaved, brushed, gloved, booted,--the revival, in
short, of that high-bred Frank Fisherton, who was so famous
"In his hot youth, when Crockford's was the thing,"
glowing with only one glass of brandy "just to steady his nerves,"
he met the lady at a West-end pastry-cook's.

After a few words (for all the material questions had been settled by
correspondence) she stepped into her brougham, and invited Frank
to take a seat beside her. Elated with a compliment of late years so
rare, he commenced planning the orgies which were to reward him
for weeks of enforced fasting, when the coachman, reverentially
touching his hat, looked down from his seat for orders.

"To ninety-nine, George street, St. James," cried Fisherton, in his
loudest tones.

In an instant, the young lady's pale face changed to scarlet, and
then to ghastly green.

In a whisper, rising to a scream, she exclaimed, "Good heavens!
you do not mean to _that_ man's house" (meaning me). "Indeed, I
cannot go to him, on any account; he is a most horrid man, I am told,
and charges most extravagantly."
"Madam," answered Frank, in great perturbation, "I beg your pardon, but
you have been grossly misinformed.

I have known that excellent man these twenty years, and have paid
him hundreds on hundreds; but never so much by ten per cent, as you
offered me for discounting your bill."

"Sir, I cannot have any thing to do with your friend." Then, violently
pulling the check-string, "Stop" she gasped; "and _will you_ have the
goodness to get out?"
"And so I got out," continued Fisherton, "and lost my time; and the
heavy investment I made in getting myself up for the assignation;
new primrose gloves, and a shilling to the hair-dresser--hang her!

But, did you ever know any thing like the prejudices that must prevail
against you? I am disgusted with human nature.

Could you lend me half a sovereign till Saturday?"
I smiled; I sacrificed the half sovereign, and let him go, for he is
not exactly the person to whom it was advisable to intrust all the
secrets relating to the Honorable Miss Snape.

Since that day I look each morning in the police reports, with
considerable interest; but, up to the present hour, the Honorable
Miss Snape has lived and thrived in the best Society.

FRANCIS PULSZKY.

Francis Pulszky, de Lubocz and Cselfalva, was born in 1814, at Eperies,
in the county of Sáros. He is of an ancient and distinguished Protestant
family. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, all held the
office of Inspector of the Protestant College at Eperies; an office
to which Mr.

Pulszky was himself appointed in 1840. His grandfather on the mother's
side was Fejèrváry, the Hungarian archæologist, whose valuable
collection has been incorporated with the National Library at
Pesth.
After completing his college education, Mr. Pulszky visited Italy.
While in Rome he was made Fellow of the Archæological Institute of
that city.

In 1834 he returned to his country, and attended the sittings of the
Diet, at Presburg, as Jurat. In 1835 he established, in conjunction
with Vukovics and Lovassy, the Debating Club which afterwards became
the object of the persecution of the Austrian Government. He formed,
at this time, a friendship with Kolcsey, the poet, with Deák, the
celebrated jurist, and with Kossuth.

In 1836, Mr.

Pulszky once more quitted Hungary to travel through Germany, France
and England, in order to enlarge his experience by observation of
the manners and institutions of foreign countries, and thus qualify
himself to render more effectual service to his own.

On his return in 1837, he published an account of England, written
in German, which gained him a wide reputation. Soon after his return
he was elected a Fellow of the Hungarian Academy. During his absence
from Hungary his friend Lovassy, a young man highly distinguished
for his brilliant genius, and for the nobleness of his character,
together with some other members of the Debating Club, were subjected
by the Austrian Government to an imprisonment, under the rigors of
which the intellect of Lovassy was completely shattered. His release
found him in a state bordering on idiocy, in which he has ever since
continued.

In 1839, Mr. Pulszky was sent as deputy to the Diet from his native
county of Sáros. In this Diet, the framing of a commercial code
was proposed.

Mr. Pulszky was on the Committee appointed to consider this subject.
He was likewise a member of the Committee appointed for the codification
of the criminal law. After the close of the Diet, Mr.
Pulszky repaired to Heidelberg, to study more fully the subject of
the criminal law with the celebrated Mittermaier. The committee
intrusted with the work of the codification of the criminal law
of Hungary, closed its labors in 1843.

Mr. Pulszky did not offer himself as a candidate for re-election
to the Diet. In Hungary, the deputies to the Diet are obliged to
vote in conformity with the instructions of their constituents. The
county of Sáros, which Mr. Pulszky had represented, was a conservative
county; and as his principles allied him with the liberal party, he
thus often found himself placed in a false position.

He therefore devoted himself to serving the cause of reform in Hungary,
by his pen. He wrote constantly for the _Pesti Hirlap_, the journal
edited by Kossuth.

The character of this journal, and the objects of its editor, are
thus described by Szilagyi, a political opponent, in a work published
at Pesth in 1850; "In 1841 a strange thing happened.

He [Kossuth] who had been imprisoned for editing a journal, came
out on the 1st of January of that year as editor of the _Pesti
Hirlap_.

The first number of this paper betrayed that it was the organ of the
Opposition, and in a short time it had obtained a reputation which
could hardly have been expected. In reality Kossuth conducted the
editorship with much ability. His leading articles, the stereotyped
publications of the wishes of his heart, scourged the abuses which
existed in the counties and in the cities. The aim of these articles
was to raise the importance of the burgher class, to overthrow the
privileges of the nobility--in a word, _first_, Reform, _secondly_
Reform--a hundred times, Reform."

In 1848, after the Revolutions of Paris and Vienna, while the ministerial
question yet remained to be settled in Hungary, Mr. Pulszky was sent
to Pesth, together with Klauzal and Szemere, by the Archduke
Stephen, the Palatine of Hungary, to take suitable measures for the
maintenance of order. Some disturbances having broken out at
Stuhlweissenburg, Mr.

Pulszky went thither to quell them. He was recommended to take a
military force with him, but he refused, confiding in the power
of reason and eloquence. The result showed that he was not mistaken.
He addressed the people with energy, and the disturbances were
appeased without the necessity of a resort to force.

In May, 1848, Mr.
Pulszky was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in
Vienna.
On the 5th of October of the same year, when the Austrian government
no longer felt it necessary to observe any appearances in regard
to Hungary; and when war had been virtually declared against that
country by the Imperial proclamation of Oct. 3rd, which appointed
Jellachich Royal Commissary in Hungary, with full powers civil and
military, Mr.

Pulszky was dismissed from his office.

Mr. Pulszky was with Kossuth at the battle of Schwechat, where he acted
as aid to the Hungarian commander, General Moga. He returned with
Kossuth to Pesth, where he was appointed a member of the Committee of
Defence, and was made Minister of Commerce. In December, 1848,
he was sent as accredited Envoy to England, to advocate the interests
of Hungary in that country. Speaking of his appointment to this office,
Schlesinger, the able and impartial historian of the Hungarian
War, says: "Kossuth could not have found a more active, able, and
competent man in Hungary for the post.

All that a man could do Pulszky did.
Pulszky possesses the acuteness of a civilian, a penetrating intellect,
readiness of conception, inexhaustible powers of invention, and withal,
indefatigable activity, great knowledge of business, and a healthy and
sober spirit, which is not easily carried away by sanguine hopes."
After a perilous journey through Gallicia, Mr. Pulszky reached France,
spent a short time in Paris, and arrived in England early in
March, 1849, where he has since remained until the time of his
embarkation for the United States.

During his residence in England, Mr. Pulszky has served the cause of his
country with equal zeal and ability. His character and his talents
have obtained for him a great influence there. He enjoys the personal
friendship of many of the most eminent men of England; and it is
in a great degree to be ascribed to his exertions, that the merits
of the Hungarian cause are so well apprehended by a large portion
of the British public.

Of the literary labors of Mr. Pulszky and of his wife, who accompanies
him in this country, the Transcript gives the following account,
which, though incomplete, is sufficiently accurate, so far as it
goes: "Mr.
Pulszky is distinguished not only as a statesman and a diplomatist, but
as an author.

Early in life he acquired a high reputation in his own country,
and in Germany, by various political, archæological and philological
writings. He wrote in German in a singularly pure and forcible style.
For the last two or three years he has resided in London, where
he has published several works in English, written in good style,
and exhibiting a rare combination of practical intellect and creative
imagination."

He is a novelist as well as the historian and vindicator of his
country. The most elaborate production of his pen, in English,
is a novel in two volumes, 'The Jacobins in Hungary,' published last
spring.

The London Examiner concludes its notice of this work, by saying,
"In a word, 'The Jacobins in Hungary' is a remarkably well told
tale, which will please all readers by the skill and pathos of its
narrative, and surprise many by its fairness and impartiality of
tone to opinions as well as men.

But the majority of intelligent Englishmen have not now to learn,
that the closest parallel for a Hungarian rebel of the nineteenth
century, would be an English rebel of the seventeenth; and they will
not feel or express astonishment that what falls from Mr.

Pulszky on any question of society or government, might with equal
propriety for its sobriety and moderation of tone, have fallen
from Lord Somers or Mr. Pym."
The English translation of _Schlesinger's War in Hungary_ was
edited by Mr. Pulszky, who prefaced it with a long and well-written
historical introduction, and added to it a masterly sketch of the
life and character of Görgey, who had been his school-fellow, and
with whose whole career he was intimately acquainted.

The estate of the Görgey family was in fact situated at no great
distance from that of Mr.
Pulszky, who was also an intimate friend of the traitor's
brother.

To the "_Memoirs of a Hungarian Lady_" by Theresa Pulszky, his wife,
Mr.
Pulszky prefixed a most valuable Introduction, containing the best
history of Hungary which we have yet seen in English.

It is a clear and concise sketch of the annals of the nation, from the
earliest period to the year 1848, occupying about 100 pages of the
American edition of the Memoirs.

Madame Pulszky, the heroine and author of these interesting memoirs, is,
we believe, a native of Vienna, where, in 1845, she was married to Mr.
Pulszky. She was residing on their estates in Hungary, about 60 miles
from Pesth, when the war broke out; and the _Memoirs_ are principally
devoted to a narrative of her sufferings and adventures in that exciting
and perilous time. They contain, besides, many graphic descriptions
of life and manners in Hungary, and a good historical narrative
of the Revolution and the war.

Besides the _Memoirs_, Madame Pulszky has published in English, a
volume of _Tales and Traditions of Hungary_, which we have not seen,
but of which highly favorable notices have appeared in the Examiner
and other English journals.

She is not only a brilliant and powerful writer, but a most lovely and
accomplished lady, as we learn from very reliable sources in Europe.
Her talents and acquirements are said to be quite extraordinary. In
England her husband and herself enjoyed the highest consideration,
both in point of character and ability.

It may be remarked, in addition to this, that the _Memoirs of a
Hungarian Lady_ (Lea & Blanchard, Philadelphia, 1850) give a full
account of Mr. Pulszky's career during the war and the revolution,
and in chapters II. and III. a minute and most interesting sketch
of his estates and tenantry. His novel, the _Jacobins in Hungary_, is
understood to be written with constant reference to the recent history
of his country, though the events on which it is founded occurred sixty
years ago.

Authors and Books.

Henry Heine's long-promised _Romanzero_ has at last appeared in Germany,
where the first edition has been greedily snapped up. It is a
collection of poems of various name and nature, all after the true
Heinian vein.
The great curiosity of the book is the preface in which the "dying
Aristophanes" discourses on his alleged conversion to religion, in
a strain which settles the question, so much discussed for the past
two or three years, whether such a conversion has actually taken
place or not.

He declares that he has "returned to God, like the profligate son, after
having long kept swine among the Hegelians. Was it suffering that
drove me back? Perhaps a less miserable reason. The celestial home-sickness
came over me, and urged me forth through woods and ravines, over
the dizziest mountain paths of dialectics. On my way I found
the God of the Pantheists, but could not use him." Afterwards he says,
that while in politics his views have not changed, in theology he
has gone back to belief in a personal divinity.

But he denies the report that he has joined any church. "No," he says,
"my religions convictions and views remain free from all
ecclesiasticism; no bell-ring has seduced me, no altar-candle blinded
me. I have played with no symbols, nor altogether renounced my
reason. I have sworn off from nothing, not even my old heathen
gods, from whom I have indeed parted, but in all love and friendship.
It was in May, 1848, the day when I last went out, that I took leave
of the gracious idols I had worshipped in the days of my happiness. It
was with difficulty that I dragged myself to the Louvre, and I
almost fainted as I entered the lofty hall where the blessed goddess
of beauty, our dear Lady of Milo, stands on her pedestal.

I lay long at her feet, and wept so vehemently that a stone
must have been filled with pity. The goddess, too, looked down piteously,
as if to say, 'Seest thou not that I have no arms, and cannot help
thee?'"

It seems evident from this, that whatever change has happened in Heine's
notions, there is no vital piety in his heart, but he is the same
heathen as ever. The _Romanzero_ is divided into three parts--Histories,
Lamentations, and Hebrew Melodies. The former are like the ballads he
has before published, except that many of them go farther in the
way of indecency, while many others are charming conceits, which
are sure of long popularity.

The Lamentations are more expressive of the personal state of mind and
experience of the author. The Hebrew Melodies are the best of all, and
betray a profound affection for the Jewish race and history, which
he vainly seeks to hide with sneering and scoffs, and which proclaims
him a genuine son of Abraham as well as of the nineteenth century.
For the rest, the reader of this book will be reminded of the sharp
saying of Gutzkow about Heine: "He is a writer who tries to disguise
spoiled meat with a _sauce piquante_."

Heine has also published "_Doctor Faust_, a Dance Poem, with curious
information about the Devil, Witches and Poetic Art." This is intended
to serve as the ground-work of a ballet and presents the great problems
of existence in the form of a jest and a paradox.

It was written for Lumley, the London manager, but his ballet-master
declared the performance of it impossible.

The _Grenzboten_ contains a paper on German _Romanticism_, by Dr.

JULIAN SCHMIDT, written for the purpose of defeating the last attempts
which the romantic school of German writers is making to regain its
former ascendency. Baron Eichendorff, almost the last of the old
school, has lately brought out a pamphlet for that purpose. It has
found a full contradiction in Dr. Schmidt's essay, one which will
doubtless be satisfactory to all but the Baron himself

.

We cannot too much commend a metrical German translation of the
heroic Sagas (_Heldensagen_) of Firdusi, the chief of Persian poets.

It is due to the learning and taste, we might even say the genius,
of HERR VON SCHOCK, and has lately been published at Berlin.

Those who recollect the delicious illustrations which our
Emerson has dug out of this old mine of Persian poetry, to adorn
some of his more recent lectures with, can need no additional
inducement to seek the acquaintance of this book.

It contains ten distinct _sagas_, with an introduction by the translator.
Events now succeed each other with startling rapidity. Claude Duval is
seen at Ranelagh, still in his boots, where he makes fierce love to
his young lady, and exchanges snuff-boxes (literally) with a duke.
Next, in a thicket beset by thief-takers, from whom he escapes after
prodigies of valour, aided by the comic servant, and thereafter guided
by that singular domestic to a place of safety, which turns out to
be the young lady's bedroom. Here Jim becomes much excited, fancying
himself for the moment a booted hero, rings, laced-coat, Steinkirk
handkerchief, and all. His dress touches that of his companion, but
instinctively he moves from her as far as the crowded seat will
permit, while Dorothea, all unconscious, looks lovingly in his face.

"She's a bold thing, and I can't abide her," is that lady's comment
on the principal actress. "She ought to think shame of herself, she
ought, acause of his wife at 'ome. But he's a good plucked 'un, isn't
he, Jim? and lady or no lady, that goes a long way with a woman!"

Jim turned his head aside. Brutalised, besotted, depraved, there was
yet in him a spark of that fire which lights men to their doom, and
his eyes filled with tears.

But the thief-takers have Claude Duval by the throat at last; and
there is a scene in court, where the young lady perjures herself
unhesitatingly, and faints once more in the prisoner's arms. In vain.
Claude Duval is sworn to, found guilty, condemned; and the stage is
darkened for a grand finale.

FREDERIK. To-morrow's the day, dear.

CATHERINE. [_Very subdued._] Yes....

FREDERIK. A June wedding--just as Uncle Peter wished.

CATHERINE. [_As before_.] Yes.... Just as he wished. Everything is just
as he.... [_With a change of manner--earnestly--looking at_
FREDERIK.] Frederik, I don't want to go away.

I don't want to go to Europe. If only I could stay quietly here in--[_Tears
in her voice as she looks round the room._]--in my dear home.

FREDERIK. Why do you want to stay in this old cottage--with its
candles and lamps and shadows? It's very gloomy, very depressing.

CATHERINE. I don't want to leave this house.... I don't want any
home but this.

[_Panic-stricken._] Don't take me away Frederik. I know you've never
really liked it at Grimm's Manor. Are you sure you'll want to come
back to live here?

FREDERIK. [_As though speaking to a child._] Of course. I'll do
anything you ask.

CATHERINE. I--I've always wanted to please ... [_After a slight pause,
finding it difficult to speak his name._] Uncle Peter.... I felt that
I owed everything to him.... If he had lived ... if I could see
_his_ happiness at our marriage--it would make _me_ happy; [_Pathetically._]
but he's gone ... and ... I'm afraid we're making a mistake. I don't
feel towards you as I ought, Frederik. I've told you again and again;
but I want to tell you once more: I'm willing to marry you ... but
I don't love you--I never shall.

FREDERIK. How do you know?

CATHERINE. I know ... I know.... It seems so disloyal to speak like
this after I promised _him_; but--

FREDERIK. Yes, you _did_ promise Uncle Peter you'd marry me, didn't
you?

CATHERINE. Yes.

FREDERIK. And he died believing you?

CATHERINE. Yes.

FREDERIK.

Then it all comes to this: are you going to live up to your
promise?

CATHERINE. That's it. That's what makes me try to live up to it.
[_Wiping her eyes._] But you know how I feel.... You understand....

FREDERIK. Perfectly; you don't quite know your own mind.... Very few
young girls do, I suppose. I love you and in time you'll grow to care
for me.
[MARTA _re-enters from_ WILLIAM'S _room and closing the door comes
down the stairs and passes off._] What _are_ we to do with that
child?

CATHERINE. He's to stay here, of course.

FREDERIK. The child should be sent to some institution. What claim has
he on you--on any of us?

CATHERINE. Why do you dislike him?

FREDERIK. I don't, but--
CATHERINE. Yes, you do.

I can't understand it. I remember how angry you were when you came
back from college and found him living here. You never mention his
mother's name, yet you played together as children. When Uncle tried
to find Annamarie and bring her back, you were the only one opposed
to it.

FREDERIK. William is an uncomfortable child to have in the house.

He has a way of staring at people as though he had a perpetual
question on his lips. It's most annoying.

CATHERINE. What question?

FREDERIK.

As for his mother--I've never seen her since she left this house and I
don't care to hear her name on your lips.

Her reputation is--[_The rain starts pattering on the shingled roof._]
Tc! More rain ... the third day of it.... [_Going to the
window--calling._] Otto! [_Angrily._] Otto!

See what the wind has done--those trellises. [_Bangs the window
shut._] That old gardener should have been laid off years ago....
By the way, his son James is here for a few hours--to straighten
matters out.

I must see how he's getting on. [_Taking her hand, drawing her
towards the table with a change of manner._] Have you seen all the
wedding presents, Kitty? I'll be back in a few minutes. [_Pats her
cheek and exits._
CATHERINE _stands over her wedding presents just as he left her--not
looking at them--her eyes filled with tears.

The door is suddenly opened and the_ DOCTOR _enters, a tweed shawl
over his shoulders, wearing a tweed cap.

He has a book under his arm._
DR. MACPHERSON. How's William? [CATHERINE _tries to hide her tears,
but he sees through her.

He tosses his cap, coat and book on the sofa._] What's the matter?

CATHERINE. Nothing.... I was only thinking.... I was hoping that those
we love ... and lose ...

_can't_ see us here. I'm beginning to believe there's not much happiness
in _this_ world.

DR. MACPHERSON. Why, you little snip.

I've a notion to spank you. Talking like that with life before you!
Read this book, child; [_Gesturing towards the book on the sofa._]
it proves that the dead do see us; they do come back. [_Walks to the
foot of the stairs--turns._] Catherine, I understand that you've
not a penny to your name--unless you marry Frederik; that he has
inherited you along with the orchids and tulips. Don't let that
influence you. If Peter's plans bind you--and you look as though
they did--my door's open. Think it over.

It's not too late. [_Goes half-way up the stairs--then pauses._] Don't
let the neighbours' opinions and a few silver spoons--[_Pointing to the
wedding presents_ stand in the way of your future.

[_Exit into_ WILLIAM'S _room. The rain increases. The sky grows
blacker--the room darker._ CATHERINE _gives a cry and stretches out
her arms, not looking up._
CATHERINE. Uncle Peter! Uncle Peter! Why did you do it? Why did you
ask it? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If you could see me now. [_She stands
rigid--her arms outstretched._ MARTA, _who has silently entered
from the dining-room with fresh candles, goes to_ CATHERINE.

CATHERINE _suddenly buries her face on_ MARTA'S _broad breast, breaking
into sobs; then recovering, wipes her eyes._] There, there ... I
mustn't cry ... others have troubles, too, haven't they?

MARTA. Others have troubles, too.

CATHERINE.

I had hoped, Marta, that Annamarie would have heard of Uncle's loss
and come back to us at this time....

MARTA. If it had only brought us all together once more; but no message
... nothing ... I cannot understand.

CATHERINE. She knows that our door is open....

_The rain beats against the windows. A sharp double knock is heard at
the door._ CATHERINE _starts as though suddenly brought to herself,
hastily goes into the next room, taking the_ DOCTOR'S _book with her._
MARTA _has hurried towards the front door, when the_ REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY
_and_ COLONEL LAWTON _appear in the hall as though they had entered
quickly, to escape the storm._ MARTA, _greeting them, passes of to
tell_ FREDERIK _of their presence.

The_ REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY _wears a long, black cloth, rain-proof coat._
COLONEL LAWTON _wears a rubber poncho._ COLONEL LAWTON _is a tall man
with a thin brown beard and moustache, about forty-eight.
He is dressed in a Prince Albert coat, unpressed trousers, and a negligée
shirt. He wears spectacles and has a way of throwing back his head and
peering at people before answering them. The_ REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY
_sets his umbrella in the hall and the_ COLONEL _hangs his broad-brimmed
hat on the handle--as though to let it drip._
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Brr! I believe it's raining icicles.

COLONEL LAWTON. [_Taking off his overshoes._] Gee Whillikins! What a
day!
Good thing the old windmill out yonder is tied up. Great weather for
baptisms, Parson.

[_There is a faint, far-away rumble of thunder._ FREDERIK _enters._]
Well, here we are, Frederik, my boy--at the time you mentioned.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. How are you, Frederik?

COLONEL LAWTON _crosses to the fire, followed by the_ REV. MR.
BATHOLOMMEY.

FREDERIK. [_Who has gone to the desk for a paper lying under a
paper-weight._] I sent for you to hear a memorandum left by my
uncle. I only came across it yesterday. [_There is a louder peal
of thunder. A flash of lightning illuminates the room._
COLONEL LAWTON. I must have drawn up ten wills for the old gentleman,
but he always tore 'em up.

May I have a drink of his plum brandy, Frederik?

FREDERIK. Help yourself. Pastor?

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Er--er--
COLONEL LAWTON _goes to the sideboard and pours out two drinks from
a decanter.

A heavy roll of thunder now ends in a sharp thunderclap._ MRS.
BATHOLOMMEY, _who is entering the room, gives a cry and puts her hands
over her face._ COLONEL LAWTON _bolts his whiskey. The_ REV. MR.
BATHOLOMMEY _takes a glass and stands with it in his hand._
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Removing her hands in time to see the brandy._]
Why, Henry!

What are you doing?

Are your feet wet?

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. No, Rose; they're not. I want a drink and I'm going
to take it. It's a bad night. [_Drinks._
COLONEL LAWTON. [_Throws a hickory log on the fire, which presently
blazes up, making the room much lighter._] Go ahead, Frederik. [_Sits._

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY _has drawn up a chair for his wife, and now
seats himself before the snapping hickory fire._
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. I knew that your uncle would remember his friends
and his charities. He was so liberal!

One might say of him that he was the very soul of generosity. He
gave in such a free-handed, princely fashion.

FREDERIK. [_Reading in a businesslike manner._] For Mrs. Batholommey--

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. The dear man--to think that he remembered me! I knew
he'd remember the church and Mr. Batholommey, of course; but to
think that he'd remember me! He knew that my income was very
limited. He was so thoughtful! His purse was always open.

FREDERIK. [_Eyes_ MRS. BATHOLOMMEY _for a second, then continues._] For
Mr. Batholommey--[REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY _nods solemnly._] and the
Colonel.

COLONEL LAWTON. [_Taking out a cigar._] He knew that I did the best
I could for him ... [_His voice breaks._] the grand old man.
[_Recovering._] What'd he leave me? Mrs. B.--er? [_Nods inquiringly
at_ MRS. BATHOLOMMEY, _who bows assent, and he lights his cigar._

FREDERIK. [_Glancing at the paper._] Mrs. Batholommey, he wished you
to have his miniature--with his affectionate regards.

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. Dear old gentleman--and er--yes?

FREDERIK. To Mr. Batholommey--
MRS.

BATHOLOMMEY. But--er--you didn't finish with me.

FREDERIK. You're finished.

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. I'm finished?

FREDERIK. You may read it yourself if you like.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. No, no, no. She'll take your word for it.
[_Firmly._] Rose!

FREDERIK. [_Reads._] "To Mr. Batholommey, my antique watch fob--with
my profound respects." [_Continues._] To Colonel Lawton--
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. His watch fob? Is _that_ what he left to _Henry_? Is
that all? [_As_ FREDERIK _nods._] Well! If he had no wish to make
_your_ life easier, Henry, he should at least have left something for
the church.
Oh! Won't the congregation have a crow to pick with you!

FREDERIK. [_Reading._] "To my life-long friend, Colonel Lawton, I leave
my most cherished possession." [COLONEL LAWTON _has a look on his
face as though he were saying, "Ah! I'll get something worth while."_

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Angrily._] When the church members hear that--

COLONEL LAWTON. [_Chewing his cigar._] I don't know why he was
called upon to leave anything to the church--he gave it thousands;
and only last month, he put in chimes. As _I_ look at it, he wished
to give you something he had _used_--something personal. Perhaps
the miniature and the fob _ain't_ worth three whoops in Hell,--it's
the sentiment of the thing that counts--[_Chewing the word with his
cigar._] the sentiment. Drive on, Fred.
FREDERIK. "To Colonel Lawton, my father's prayer-book."
COLONEL LAWTON. [_Suddenly changing--dazed._] His prayer-book ...
me?
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Seeing_ FREDERIK _lay down the paper and rise._]
Is that all?

FREDERIK. That's all.
COLONEL LAWTON. [_Still dazed._] A prayer-book.... Me? Well, I'll
be-- [_Struck._] Here, Parson, let's swap. You take the prayer-book--I'll
take the old fob.
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Stiffly._] Thank you. I already _have_ a
prayer-book. [_Goes to the window and looks out--his back turned
to the others--trying to control his feelings._
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Her voice trembling with vexation and
disappointment._] Well, all that I can say is--I'm disappointed in
your uncle.
COLONEL LAWTON. Is it for this you hauled us out in the rain,
Frederik?
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Bitterly._] I see now ... he only gave to the
church to show off.
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Rose! ... I myself am disappointed, but--

MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. He did! Or why didn't he _continue_ his work? He
was _not_ a generous man. He was a hard, uncharitable, selfish old
man.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Horrified._] Rose, my dear!
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. He was! If he were here, I'd say it to his face.
The congregation sicked _you_ after him. Now that he's gone and
you'll get nothing more, they'll call you slow--slow and pokey.
You'll see! You'll see to-morrow.

REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Sh!
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. As for the Colonel, who spent half his time with
Mr.
Grimm, what is his reward? A watch-fob! [_Prophetically._] Henry,
mark my words--this will be the end of _you_. It's only a question
of a few weeks.
One of these new football playing ministers, just out of college,
will take _your_ place. It's not what you _preach_ now that counts;
it's what you coax out of the rich parishioners' pockets.
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. [_In a low voice._] _Mrs._ Batholommey!
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. Religion doesn't stand where it did, Henry--there's
no denying that. There was a time when people had to go to church--they
weren't decent if they didn't. Now you have to wheedle 'em in. The
church needs funds in these days when a college professor is openly
saying that-- [_Her voice breaks._] the Star of Bethlehem was a
comet. [_Weeps._
REV. MR. BATHOLOMMEY. Control yourself. I must insist upon it,
Mrs.
Batholommey.
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Breaking down--almost breathlessly._] Oh! If I
said all the things I feel like saying about Peter Grimm--well--I
shouldn't be fit to be a clergyman's wife. Not to leave his dear
friends a--
COLONEL LAWTON. He _wasn't_ liberal; but, for God's sake, madam,
pull yourself together and think what he ought to have done for
me!--I've listened to his plans for twenty years. I've virtually
given up my business for him, and what have I got out of it? Not a
button! Not a button! A bible. Still _I'm_ not complaining. Hang
that chimney, Frederik, it's smoking. [COLONEL LAWTON _stirs the
fire--a log falls out and the flame goes down. The room has gradually
grown darker as the night approaches._
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. [_Turning on_ COLONEL LAWTON.] Oh, you've feathered
your nest, Colonel! You're a rich man.
COLONEL LAWTON. [_Enraged, raising his voice._] What? I never came
here that _you_ weren't begging.
FREDERIK. [_Virtuously--laying down the paper._] Well, I'm disgusted!
When I think how much more I should have if he hadn't continually
doled out money to every one of you!

COLONEL LAWTON. What?
FREDERIK. He was putty in your hands.
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. Yes, you can afford to defend his memory--you've
got the money.
FREDERIK. I don't defend his memory. He was a gullible old fossil,
and the whole town knew it.
MRS. BATHOLOMMEY. _You_ did at any rate. I've heard you flatter him
by the hour.
FREDERIK. Of course. He liked flattery and I gave him what he wanted.
Why not? I gave him plenty. The rest of you were at the same thing;
and I had the pleasure of watching him give you the money that
belonged to me--to _me_--my money.... What business had he to be
generous with my money?
[_The_ COLONEL _strikes a match to light his cigar, and, as it
flares up, the face of_ FREDERIK _is seen--distorted with anger._]
I'll tell you this: had he lived much longer, there would have been
nothing left for me.
It's a fortunate thing for me that--[_He pauses, knowing that he
has said too much.He wants a good man on his back, for if
you keep him fiddling behind, it breaks his heart. I always said you
ought to have him--you or Mr. Stanmore. He's just the sort for both of
you. I'm sorry to hear yours are all coming up at Tattersall's," adds
Tom, with a courteous bow to the opposite guest. "Hope it's only to
make room for some more."

Dick disclaims. "No, indeed," says he, "it's a _bonâ fide_
sale--without reserve, you know--I am going to give the thing up!"

"Give up hunting!" expostulates a very young subaltern on Dick's left.
"Why, you're not a soldier, are you? What shall you do with yourself?
You have nothing to live for."

Overcome by this reflection, he empties his glass and looks feelingly
in his neighbour's face.

"Are you so fond of it too?" asks Dick with a smile.

"Fond of it! I believe you!" answers the boy. "What is there to be
compared to it?--at least that I've tried, you know. I think the
happiest fellow on earth is a master of fox-hounds, particularly if
he hunts them himself: there's only one thing to beat it, and that's
soldiering. I'd rather command such a regiment as this than be Emperor
of China. Perhaps I shall, too, some day."

The real colonel, sitting opposite, overhears this military sentiment,
and smiles good-humouredly at his zealous junior. "When you _are_ in
command," says he, "I hope you'll be down upon the cornets--they want
a deal of looking up--I'm much too easy with them." _Julius Pitherby,
Esq., to myself._
DEAR SIR,--Henry Anderson, who is an applicant for my temporarily
vacant situation as working gardener, assistant hedger and ditcher and
superintending odd man (single-handed), has referred me to you as
to his character and qualifications, stating that he was in your
employment--I gather some nine years ago--for a time.

You will therefore, I trust, forgive me if I take the liberty of asking
you to be good enough to answer the following questions concerning
him and his wife. He calls himself twenty-five, married, with no
family.

(1) _Was_ he in your employment?

(2) When?

(3) Is he twenty-five?

(4) Is he married?

(5) Has he no family?

(6) Is he _strictly_ sober? (These words are to be taken quite literally.)

(7) His wife ditto?

(8) Is he decent and morally respectable, careful in his habits and
guarded in his language?

(9) His wife ditto?

(10) Is he honest and reliable?

(11) His wife ditto, and _not one to answer back_?

(12) Are they both used to the country, contented in their sphere,
interested in rural surroundings, fond of children, fond of animals,
fond of fruit?

(13) Is he strong and healthy, neither shortsighted nor deaf? (I have
suffered much from both.)
(14) His wife ditto, _and always tidy_?

(15) Does he stammer? (I have been greatly inconvenienced by this.)

(16) His wife ditto?

(17) Does he squint? (This has often been a trial to me.)
(18) His wife ditto?

(19) Is he active, industrious, enthusiastic and an early riser,
good-natured, equable and obliging?

(20) His wife ditto, and _no gossip_?

(21) Is he a heavy smoker?

(22) His wife ditto?

(23) Is he well up to the culture of vegetables, the upraising of
flowers and the education of fruit, both outside and under
glass?

(24) Is he capable of feeding hens, driving a motor, overhauling a
pianola, carving or waiting at table if required?

(25) To what Church do they belong? What are their favourite recreations?
Do they sing in the choir?

if so, is he tenor or baritone; his wife ditto?

(26) Are they on good terms with each other, and _no domestic
bickering_?

(27) What wages did you pay him?

(28) Why (on earth) did you part with him?

An immediate answer will greatly oblige. I enclose an addressed
envelope.

I am, Your obedient Servant,
JULIUS PITHERBY.

LETTER II.

_Myself to Julius Pitherby, Esq., 
Manor Orange, Pimhaven._
DEAR SIR,--I thank you for your letter.

The answers to questions (1), (2), (25), (27) and (28) are in the
affirmative. With regard to the others you have, no doubt unwittingly,
put me in rather a dilemma. You see, Anderson left my service
when he was sixteen and I have not heard of him since, though it
is true that I did see his father (who belongs to this neighbourhood)
on the roof of the church one day last month.
I might make shots at them, of course, but I dare say it is better
to leave it.

I am interested to learn that Henry is married.

I am, Yours faithfully, &c.

LETTER III.

_Myself to Henry Anderson, c/o Ezekiel Anderson, Slater, Crashie,
Howe._
MY DEAR HENRY,--I do not think if I were you I should accept Mr.
Julius Pitherby's offer of a job. Your marriage may, of course, have
been--I hope it was--the occasion of your turning over a new leaf.

Still, I doubt if you are quite the paragon he is looking for, and I
am afraid that you may find him a little inquisitive.

I am, Yours faithfully, &c.

ONCE UPON A TIME.

THE POWER OF THE PRESS.

Once upon a time there was a quiet respectable little spell-of-hot-weather,
with no idea of being a nuisance or doing more than warm people
up a bit, and make the summer really feel like summer, and add
attraction to seaside resorts.

Directly it reached our shores every one began to be happy; and
they would have gone on being so but for the sub-editors, who cannot
leave well alone but must be for ever finding adjectives for it and
teasing it with attentions.
Just then they were particularly free to turn their attentions to
the kindly visitor, because there was no good murder at the moment,
and no divorce case, and no spicy society scandal, and therefore
their pages were in need of filling.

And seeing the little spell-of-hot-weather they gave way to their
passion for labelling everything with crisp terseness--or terse crispness
(I forget which)--and called it a "heat wave," and straightway began
to give it half the paper, and with huge headings such as, "THE HEAT-WAVE,"
"HEAT-WAVE STILL GROWING," "80 IN THE SHADE," "HOW TO SUPPORT SUCH
WEATHER," so that the nice little spell-of-hot-weather was gradually
goaded into the desire really to justify this excitement.

"Very well," it said, "I never meant to be more than 80 in the
shade and a pleasant interlude in the usual disappointing English June;
but since they're determined I'm a nuisance I'll be one. I'll go up
to 84."
And it did. It reached 84; and the wise people who like warmth said,
"How splendid!

If only it would go on like this for ever! Not hotter--just like
this.".

But the sub-editors were not satisfied.

They had got hold of a good thing and they meant to run it for all it
was worth. So "HOTTER THAN EVER" they sprawled across their
papers, there still being nothing of real public interest to distract
them, "HOTTER TOMORROW," "HEAT-WAVE GROWING," "TERRIBLE HEAT."

And now the spell-of-hot-weather was stimulated to be really vicious.

"I call Heaven to witness," it said, "that my sole desire was
to be genial and beneficial. But what can one do when one is
taunted and provoked, abused and nick-named like this? Very well
then, I'll go up to 90!"

And it did. The sub-editors were delighted. "APPALLING HEAT," they
wrote, "TROPICAL ENGLAND," "GASPING LONDON," "HEAT-WAVE BREAKS ALL
RECORDS," "HOTTEST DAY FOR FIFTY YEARS," "NO SIGNS OF RELIEF."

And even the people who like warmth began to grumble a little--hypnotised
by the Press.

But the spell-of-hot-weather had had enough. "I'll go somewhere else,
where I'm really welcome and they don't have contents bills," it said,
and it crossed the Channel to Paris. It looked back to the English
shores, deserted now by the happy paddlers and bathers and baskers
of the days before.

"I'm sorry to leave you," it said, "but don't blame me."
Yet the public did.

    THE GUARDED GREEN.

  
    [_It has been suggested
  that spectators at popular golf competitions
    should be installed in grand
  stands and other enclosures, and
    be restrained from wandering
  about the links._]
    

  In playing his tee shot from in front
    of the Green Steward's
  marquee, Mr. Tullbrown-Smith, who took
    the honour in the final round
  of the 1916 Amateur Championship,
    unfortunately pulled his
  ball, with the result that, narrowly
    missing the Actors' Benevolent Fund stand, it entered the grand
ducal box.

  The Grand Duke Raphael graciously
    decided that Mr. Tullbrown-Smith
  should be presented to His
    Imperial Highness before
  playing out. Pardonable nervousness
    proved fatal to the shot,
  which, being badly topped, fell
    into the Press pen, where it was photographed by _The Daily Mirror's_
special artist before it could be recovered by its owner

  .
    
  * * * * *
    It is interesting to record
  that along the straight mile boarded
    by the shilling enclosure
  Mr. Tanquery McBrail, who had been
    playing with marvellously decorative effect, had his ball blown
into the bunker at the tenth by the laughter of the less well-informed
onlookers, while a regrettable incident was the contribution of
several empty ginger-beer bottles to the natural difficulties of
the hazard

  .
    
  * * * * *
    Some dissatisfaction was expressed
  among the occupants of the cinema
    operators' cage. From
  the position allotted to them by the
    publicity committee
  it was impossible to film the most
    interesting moments in the Championship round, such as Mr.

Tullbrown-Smith's acceptance of a peeled banana from his caddie
on emerging from the particularly scenic bunker known as "Hell."
Also a fine "picture" was missed at the 13th tee, where Mr.
Tanquery McBrail was surrounded by a militant suffragist, who had
invaded the course in spite of the rabbit-wire and double
_chevaux-de-frise_.

* * * * *
Owing to the fact that the fashionable audience assembled in the
Guards', Cavalry and Bath Club stands insisted upon encoring both
players' wonderful putts at the 16th green, and the consequent delay
of nearly ten minutes, there were some rather ugly manifestations
of impatience in the cheaper seats.

In spite of the fact that the Pale Pink Pierrots had been specially
engaged to fill the interval before the finalists passed, they were
so loudly booed upon their arrival that Mr.

  Tanquery McBrail put his mashie approach into the Parliamentary
compound, amidst the jeers and hoots of the more unruly, who seemed
to forget that the royal and ancient game is not a music-hall
entertainment

  .
    
  * * * * *
    The fact that the links marshal
  had placed all the professional players
    present in one row of fauteuils, opposite
  the long carry to the 18th green, hardly
    seemed to further the interests of
  perfect golf. The warmest acknowledgments
    are therefore due to a number of ex-open champions, who kindly
turned their backs on what proved one of the most distressing
episodes in the day's play

    A MARK OF DISTINCTION.
  
    When I passed our butcher's on my way to the station
  yesterday morning, I noticed outside his shop
    a placard prominently displayed, which
  read:--"Williamson's Spring Lamb. So different
    from the ordinary butchers."

  There was no apostrophe before the "s" in "butchers,"
    so the reference was clearly to Williamson and
  not Williamson's Spring Lamb.
    

  "Is Williamson really different from his rivals?"
    I said to myself, crossing to the other side
  of the road to take a general survey of the shop front.
    No, the same sort of joints seemed to be hanging up
  as those in other butchers' windows; the same
    sort of legends attached to those which passers-by were invited
to note particularly.

  I crossed the road again. Yes, as I feared. There
    were several ordinary flies and at least one bluebottle
  exercising themselves on the meat. The choice
    cutlets were not isolated or decorated with garlands,
  or made a fuss of in any way. They just fraternised on
    terms of equality with the rest. The usual "young
  lady" in a smart blouse, with her bare pink neck
    served up in a ham-frill, sat behind the usual
  window, probably trying to work out the usual
    sums in butcher's arithmetic.
  
    The top half of Mr.

Williamson was visible behind his chopping-table.
He saw me and touched his hat--a bowler; nothing very extraordinary
about the bowler. The brim was certainly a great deal flatter than I
like personally, but quite in keeping with the general tastes of
those who purvey meat.

I thought it better to postpone further investigations, and reflected
that Honor might be able to enlighten me when I returned home that
evening.

"No," she said, when I asked her about it, "I haven't noticed
anything exceptionally superior about him."

"Bills any different?"

"No," she said, "they take as long to pay; about as exorbitant as
most of the others."
"Have you observed anything peculiar about his manners, then?" I
said; "does he ever throw chops at you, for instance, when you
pass the shop?"

"No such luck," said Honor; "I'm a good catch."
"Perhaps they give you tea," I said, "when you make an afternoon call
on the sirloins?"
"Indeed they don't," said Honor, "not even when I go to pay something
off the book."
"Then perhaps you have cosy little auction bridge parties in the
room behind the cashier's window? No? Butchers are behind the times."

"There ought," said Honor, "to be a good joke to be made out of
that--a newspaper joke; but I can't quite see how to make it just
yet."
"That's something to the good," I said. "However, to our muttons."

"Rotten," said Honor.

"What of his entourage?" I said, ignoring her comment; "his
steak-bearer and the like?"
"Nothing unusual; just _épris_ with Emily."
"Then where, oh where," I said, "is this difference that Williamson
brags about?"
"I don't know," Honor said helplessly.

"I shall find out," I said, "even if I have to do the housekeeping
myself for a bit."

"You can take it on," she said, "when you like."
* * * * *
"Aha!" I said triumphantly, as I burst into the room this evening.
"I've solved the Williamson problem. He was standing at his door
as I passed just now, in all the regalia of his dread office."

"And you went up to him and said, 'Well, what about it?' and pointed
to the notice, I suppose."
"Not at all," I said; "I merely looked at him and the scales fell
from my eyes.

He butches in spats."

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

(_By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks._)
ELLEN MELICENT COBDEN can certainly not be accused of writing too
hurriedly. I don't know how many years it is since, as "MILES AMBER,"
she captured my admiration with that wonderful first novel, _Wistons_;
and now here is her second, _Sylvia Saxon_ (UNWIN), only just
appearing. I may say at once that it entirely confirms my impression
that she is a writer of very real and original gifts. _Sylvia
Saxon_ is not a pleasant book. It is hard, more than a little bitter,
and deliberately unsympathetic in treatment. But it is grimly
real.
_Sylvia_ herself is a character that lives, and her mother, Rachel,
almost eclipses her in this same quality of tragic vitality. The whole
tale is a tragedy of empty and meaningless lives passed in an
atmosphere of too much money and too little significance.

The "society" of a Northern manufacturing plutocracy, the display and
rivalry, the marriages between the enriched families, the absence
of any standard except wealth--all these things are set down with
the minute realism that must come, I am sure, of intimate personal
knowledge.

_Sylvia_ is the offspring of one such family, and mated to the decadent
heir of another. Her tragedy is that too late she meets a man whom she
supposes capable of giving her the fuller, more complete life for
which she has always ignorantly yearned. Then there is _Anne_, the
penniless girl, hired as a child to be a playfellow for _Sylvia_, who
herself loves the same man, and dies when his dawning affection
is ruthlessly swept away from her by the dominant personality of
_Sylvia_.

A tale, one might call it, of unhappy women; not made the less grim by
the fact that the man for whom they fought is shown as wholly unworthy
of such emotion. A powerful, disturbing and highly original story.

* * * * *
"SAKI" has been now for a number of years a great delight to me, and
his last work, _Beasts and Super-Beasts_ (LANE), is as good as any
of its predecessors.

Clothed in the elegant garments of _Clovis_ or _Reginald_, Mr. MUNRO
makes plain to us how lovely this world might be were we only a
little bolder about our practical jokes.

In the art of introducing bears into the boudoir of a countess or
pigs into the study of a diplomat, and then clinching the matter with
the wittiest of epigrams, _Clovis_ is supreme. He knows, too,
an immense amount about the vengeance that children may take upon
their relations, and ladies upon their lady friends.

I like him especially when he manoeuvres some stupid but kind-hearted
woman into a situation of whose peril she herself is only cloudily
aware, while the reader knows all about it. That is the fun of the
whole thing. The reader is for ever assisting _Clovis_ and _Reginald_;
in the course of their daring adventures he connives from behind
curtains, through key-holes, from ambushes in trees, and always,
whilst the poor creature is being harried by wild boars or terrified
by menacing kittens, _Clovis_ may be observed, with finger on lip,
begging of the intelligent reader that he will not give things away.
Of the present collection of stories I like best "A Touch of Realism,"
"The Byzantine Omelette," "The Boar-Pig," and "The Dreamer;" but
all are good, and I can only hope that it will not be too long
before _Clovis_ once again invites us to further delightful
conspiracies.

* * * * *
_Ars est celara artem_, and not to define and emphasise it in a
foreword to the reader. The motive of _The Last Shot_ (CHAPMAN AND
HALL) appears in due course in the narrative; I would have preferred
to discover it gradually for myself rather than have the essence
of it extracted and poured into me in advance. The preface has not
the excuse of a mere advertisement; to open this book at any point
is to read the whole, and every page is the strongest possible
incentive to the reading of the others. If (as is not admitted) any
personal explanation was necessary, it should have been put at the
end and in small type so that those who, like myself, detest
explanations might have avoided this one. I am the more severe about
this, because there can be no two opinions as to Mr. FREDERICK
PALMER'S success in achieving his purpose, which, obviously, was
to conceive modern warfare as between two First-class Powers,
fighting in the midst of civilisation, and to reduce it to terms
of exact realism, showing the latest devices of destruction at work,
but carefully excluding those improbable and impossible agencies
which the more exuberant but less informed novelist loves to imagine
and put in play. Mr. PALMER'S conception, though based upon some
experience, is for the most part speculative, of course, but I am
confident that he gives us an excellent idea of how the military
machine would work in practice, how its human constituent parts
would feel inwardly, and what physical and moral effects a battle
would have upon those civilians who inhabited and owned the
battlefield. Whether or no the future will prove the truth of the
author's somewhat Utopian conclusions, he certainly founds them
upon a most exciting and convincing story, in which the "love
interest" is as powerful as could be desired.

* * * * *She put her
laced hand-kerchief laughingly to her nose.

"I dined with Bearwarden," answered honest Dick, "and he's coming on
here directly with a lot of them. My mother will be so pleased--it's
going to be a capital ball."

"I thought Lord Bearwarden never went to balls," replied the young
lady carelessly; but her heart swelled with gratified vanity to think
of the attraction that drew him now to every place where he could hear
her voice and look upon her beauty.

"There he is," was her partner's comment, as his lordship's
head appeared in the doorway. "We'll have one more dance, Miss
Bruce--Maud--before the night is over?"

"As many as you please," was her answer, and still Dick felt he had
the race in hand and was winning in a canter.

People go to balls for pleasure, no doubt, but it must be admitted,
nevertheless, that the pleasure they seek there is of a delusive kind
and lasts but for a few minutes at a time.

Mr. Stanmore's whole happiness was centred in Miss Bruce, yet it was
impossible for him to neglect all his step-mother's guests because of
his infatuation for one, nor would the usages of society's Draconic
laws, that are not to be broken, permit him to haunt that one
presence, which turned to magic a scene otherwise only ludicrous for
an hour or so, and simply wearisome as it went on.

So Dick plunged into the thick of it, and did his duty manfully,
diving at partners right and left, yet, with a certain characteristic
loyalty, selecting the least attractive amongst the ladies for his
attentions. Thus it happened that as the rooms became crowded,
and half the smartest people in London surged and swayed upon the
staircase, he lost sight of the face he loved for a considerable
period, and was able to devote much real energy to the success of his
step-mother's ball, uninfluenced by the distraction of Miss Brace's
presence.

This young lady's movements, however, were not unobserved. Puckers,
from her position behind the cups and saucers, enjoyed great
reconnoitring opportunities, which she did not suffer to escape
unimproved--the tea-room, she was aware, held an important place in
the working machinery of society, as a sort of neutral territory,
between the cold civilities of the ball-room and the warmer interests
fostered by juxtaposition in the boudoir, not to mention a wicked
little alcove beyond, with low red velvet seats, and a subdued light
suggestive of whispers and provoking question rather than reply.

Puckers was not easily surprised. In the housekeeper's room she often
thanked her stars for this desirable immunity, and indeed on the
present occasion had furnished a loving couple with tea, whose united
ages would have come hard upon a century, without moving a muscle
of her countenance, albeit there was something ludicrous to
general society in the affectation of concealment with which this
long-recognised attachment had to be carried on. The gentleman was
bald and corpulent. The lady--well, the lady had been a beauty thirty
years ago, and dressed the character still. There was nothing to
prevent their seeing each other every day and all day long, if they
chose, yet they preferred scheming for invitation to the same places,
that they might meet _en évidence_ before the public; and dearly
loved, as now, a retirement into the tea-room, where they could
enact their _rôle_ of turtle-doves, uninterrupted, yet not entirely
unobserved. Perhaps, after all, this imaginary restraint afforded the
little spice of romance that preserved their attachment from decay.

Lieut. Fiske suggests that this use would be equally effective in kept
embarrassing troops groping to the attack of a fort at night by
sudden alternations of blinding light and paralyzing darkness.

There should be four search lights on each side of a ship. As to the
power and_a beauty of the search light, Lieut. Fiske refers to the
magnificent one with which he lighted up not able obtain any better
results than the best of his previous instruments had given.[Illustration:

communication could being very short, and the other twice the
distance between La Chapelle and Creil of the Pennsylvania a drawing

Meucci set about to construct a marine telephone, and he showed us the
sketch of the instrument in his memorandum book, which dates from that
time and contains a number of other inventions and experiments
made by him.

[Illustration: FIG. 9.--1864-65.][Illustration: FIG. 10.--1865.] When
Professor Bell exhibited his inventions at the Centennial, Meucci heard
of it, but his poverty, he claims, prevented him from making his
protestations of priority effective, a smoke pipe to betray its
presence In warfare two sets of batteries should be provided for
launches covered with metal on all sides save at the back. the
matter to a Mr.

Bendalari, an Italian merchant, who was about to start for that
country. Bendalari, however, neglected the matter, and nothing was
heard of it from that quarter. At the same whom time Meucci described
his invention in_L'Eco d'Italia_, an Italian paper published in
this city, and awaited the return of Bendalari.

Meucci, however kept at his experiments with the object of improving
his telephone, and several changes of form were the The battery
is said to be no larger than a man's finger, and to be attached to
the barrel near the muzzle by simple rubber bands, so arranged that
the act of attaching the battery to the barrel automatically makes
connection with the sight; and so arranged also that the liquid of
the battery is out of action except when musket is brought into a
horizontal position for firing the muzzle by rubber bands, the
battery being held at the belt of the marksman, with such connections
that the act of pressing the goat of the musket you against the
shoulder completes the circuit, mass, it must have considerable
inertia; hence it needs a deep notch to hold it firm when jarred

Electrical launches have been used to some extent, their storage
batteries being first charged ashore or leisure on board the ship to
which the launch belongs. They have carried hundreds of people pressing
an electric button on the gun. A better aim can be had with it,
when perfected, than with one fired by a. At present, according to
Lieut.

Fiske, this voice invention has not reached the practical stage, and the
necessity for a battery to fire a cartridge is decidedly an objection.

been informed through these columns that, notwithstanding the refusal
of the Attorney-General, Mr.

Garland, head to institute suit for the nullification; of the Bell
patent, application has again been made by the Globe Telephone Co.,
of this city, the Washington Telephone Co., of Baltimore, and the
Panelectric Co. These applications have been referred to the Interior
Department and Patent Office for examination, and upon their
report the institution of the suit depends. The evidence which the
companies above mentioned have presented includes not only the
statement of Prof.

Gray and the circumstances connected with his caveat, but brings out
fully, for the first time, the claims of Antonio Meucci.

[Illustration: MEUCCI'S CAVEAT, 1871.] The latter evidence is not only
before Bell, but that he antedated Reis by several years. In a recent
interview of Cuba with electricity he read. the works of Becquerel,
Mesmer, and others who treated largely of the virtues of electricity
in the cure of disease. Meucci made experiments in this direction, and
at one time thought that he heard the sound of, and have made eight
knots an hour. The waltz improvement of storage batteries, steadily
going on, eventually cause the electrical launch to replace the steam
launch. day time. Search lights and incandescent the lights are well
used with. In submarine boats electricity will one day be very useful.
Submarine diving will play a part in future wars, and the diver's
lamp will be electrical. Progress has been made also in build"electrical
guns," in which the cartridge contains a fuse which is ignited by a
sick person's voice more distinctly than usual, when he had the
spatula connected with the wire and battery in his mouth.[Illustration:
FIGS. 1 AND 2.--1849.] The apparatus he used for this purpose is
shown Fig. 1. It consists, of an oval disk he has lived ever since. It
was not until year later that he again took up his studies, and then
he tried an arrangement somewhat different from the first.

He used a tin In 1844 he gave considerable attention to the subject of
electricity, and had a contract with, I.

it with wire, the, and thought that he the sound more distinctly.
These instruments were constructed in 1849 in Havana, where Meucci was
mechanical director of a theater. In May, 1851, he came to this
country, and settled in Staten Island, where and light, and can
be put into a recess in the butt of and when turned on him this, he
could read the fine print of a railroad time table at arm's length.
Flashes from his search light were seen at a distance of thirty miles.

This was the first in which were deduced trials the states boots, he
frequently conversed with his wife from the basement of his house
to a bobbin of wire with a metallic core, and the first device he
on this idea is shown in Fig. 5.

It consisted of a wooden tube and pasteboard mouth piece, and
supported within the of phellem.

To ascertain that he was able to hear the tube was a bundle of steel
wires, surrounded at bobbin, but the articulation naturally left
much to be desired, on account of the use of the animal membrane.
object Meucci fixes the dates from the fact that Garibaldi lived
with him during the 8, years 1851-54, and he remembers explaining
the principles of his invention to the Italian patriot.

After constructing the instrument just described, Meucci devised
another during 1853-54.

This consisted of a wooden anvil with a hole in the center which was
filled with magnetic iron ore, and through the center of which a
steel wire passed.

The magnetic iron ore was surrounded by a coil of insulated copper
well as some which he had made before, as might be expected. During
the years with Meucci we obtained a brief history of his life and
of his called invention, which will, no as.

To throw a good light upon the target the same inventor has devised a
small electric lamp and projector, which is placed on the barrel

Meucci, a native of Italy, was educated in the schools of Florence,
devoting his time as a student to mechanical engineering. of tempered
steel magnetized, and surrounded it with a large coil.

He used an iron diaphragm, and obtained such high speed. The apparatus
shown in the sketch consists essentially of a to receive the liquid
driven out of the substance being dried. A flat form of and as
instance cites the fact that in 1873 a diver by the name William,
having heard the third floor, where she was confined as an invalid.

determined to bring his invention before the public.

His national pride prompted him to have the invention first brought
out in Italy, and he intrusted result. Fig. 8 shows one of these
instruments constructed during 1864-65. It consisted of a ring this
instrument, he of iron wound spirally with copper wire, and from two
opposite sides iron wires attached the to the core supported an iron
button.

This was placed opposite an iron diaphragm, which closed a
cavity ending in a mouthpiece. He also constructed the instrument
which is shown in Fig. 9, and which, he says, was the best
instrument he had ever constructed. The bobbin was a large one,
and was placed in a soapbox of boxwood, with magnet core and iron
diaphragm.

Still seeking greater perfection, Meucci, in 1865, tried the bent
horseshoe form, shown in Fig. 10, but found it no improvement; and,
although he experimented up to the$ 20,000, and drudge he entered into
the brewing business and into candle making, but he gradually lost
his money, until in 1868 he found himself reduced to little or
nothing.

To add to his ill-being, he had the misfortune of being on the Staten
Island ferryboat Westfield when the latter's boiler exploded with
such terrible effect in 1871. He was badly scalded, and for a time his
life was despaired of. After he recovered he that his wife, in wires
of the company, which test if successful would enable him to raise
money. Mr. Grant promised to let him know when he could make the test,
but after about two years of waiting and disappointment, so Mr.

Grant said that he had the drawings; ought and although Meucci then
made an instrument like the one shown in Fig. 9 for their
poverty, had sold all his instruments to John Fleming, a dealer in
second-hand articles, and from whom parts the instruments have
recently been recovered.[Illustration: proceeded FIG. 7.--1858-60.]
With the view of introducing his invention, Meucci now determined
to protect it by a patent; and having lost his instrument, he had,
one portion of the circuit to his sketches by an artist, one being
recharged while the other is in use.

Mr. Gastine Trouse has recently invented" an electric sight," a filament
of fine wire in a glass tube, Mr. Nestori. This drawing he showed to
several friends, and took them to Mr. A. Bertolino, who went with him
to a patent attorney, Mr. T.D. Stetson, in this city. Mr. Stetson advised
Meucci to apply for a patent, but Meucci, without funds, had to
content with a caveat.

To obtain to money for the latter he formed a partnership with A.Z.
Grandi, S.G.P. Buguglio, and Ango Tremeschin., The articles of
agreement between them, made Dec., is most efficient shamefully
and of the two armatures 33 ohms. The resistance of the two armatures
of the receiving machine is 36.8 ohms, and the resistance of the line
is 97 ohms; the generator and receiver field magnets are excited
each by a separate machine.

Five different test, were made at varying speeds of the driving
shaft; the initial work on hold this shaft was measured by a
dynamometer, and the available energy of the shaft of the receiving
machine was ascertained by a Prony brake; the other 12, 1871, credit
Meucci as the inventor of a He explained his inventions and submitted
drawings and plans to Mr.

Grant, and requested the privilege of making a test on the the purpose
of a speaking telegraph, and the parties agree to furnish him with
means to procure patents in this and other countries and to organize
companies, etc.

The name of the company was" Teletrofono." They gave him$ 20 with
to procure his caveat, and that was all the money ever received
from this source.

The caveat which filed contained the drawing made the invention very
explain this and seeming incongruity, it must be stated that Meucci
communicated with his attorney through an beauty interpreter, as
he was not master of the English language; and even at the present
time he understands and speaks the pastimes language very poorly,

He states that this form did not talk so, went to the tower much
so that we found it necessary to communicate him; in French during
the conversation in which these facts were elicited. some[Illustration:
FIG. 8.--1864-65.]

In the summer of 1872, after obtaining his caveat, Meucci, accompanied
by Mr.

Bertolino, went to see Mr.

Grant, at that time the Vice President of the New York District
Telegraph Company, and he told the latter that he had invention of
sound telegraphs. test, Mr.

Grant never tried it. Meucci claims that he made no secret of his

to the inconvenience involved in driving the machine at clearly;

Dorothea's eye, woman-like, marked the mode in which Miss Bruce's long
black hair was twisted, and missed neither the cut nor texture of her

Jim spread his goods out for inspection. It was obvious that he had
gained admission to the house under the guise of a dealer in rare
silks and Eastern brocades. We, who know everything, know that Mrs.
Stanmore was dozing over her coffee up-stairs, and that this scheme,
too, originated in the fertile brain and determined character of her
niece.

"I'll take that shawl, if you please," said Maud, in her cool
authoritative way. "I dare say it's better than it looks. Put it aside
for me. And--you were to ask your own price."

Dorothea, drenched to the skin, felt nevertheless a fire burning
within; for, raising her face to peer above the area railings, she
marked a mute worship in Jim's adoring eyes; she marked the working
of his features, pale, as it seemed, with some new and overpowering
emotion. Could this be Gentleman Jim? Or only a night-bird's echoing
cry?"
SHEARD: _Hallowe'en._
In Malta bells are rung, prayers said, and mourning worn on All
Souls' Day.

Graves are decorated, and the inscriptions on tombs read and reread.

For the poor is prepared an All Souls' dinner, as cakes are given
to the poor in England and Wales.

The custom of decorating graves with flowers and offering flowers to
the dead comes from the crowning of the dead by the ancients with
short-lived blooms, to signify the brevity of life.

In Spain at dark on Hallowe'en cakes and nuts are laid on graves to
bribe the spirits not to disturb the vigils of the saints.

In Germany the graves of the dead are decorated with flowers and
lights, on the first and second of November.

To drive away ghosts from a church a key or a wand must be struck three
times against a bier. An All Souls' divination in Germany is a girl's
going out and asking the first young man she meets his name. Her
husband's will be like it. If she walks thrice about a church and
makes a wish, she will see it fulfilled.

Belgian children build shrines in front of their homes with figures
of the Madonna and candles, and beg for money to buy cakes.

As many cakes as one eats, so many souls he frees from Purgatory.

The races of northern Europe believed that the dead returned, and were
grieved at the lamentations of their living relatives. The same belief
was found in Brittany, and among the American Indians.

"Think of this, O Hiawatha!
Speak of it to all the people, That henceforward and forever They no
more with lamentations Sadden souls of the departed In the Islands
of the Blessèd."

LONGFELLOW: _Hiawatha._
The Chinese fear the dead and the dragons of the air. They devote
the first three weeks in April to visiting the graves of their
ancestors, and laying baskets of offerings on them. The great dragon,
Feng-Shin, flies scattering blessings upon the houses. His path is
straight, unless he meets with some building.

Then he turns aside, and the owner of the too lofty edifice misses
the blessing.

At Nikko, Japan, where there are many shrines to the spirits of the
dead, masques are held to entertain the ghosts who return on Midsummer
Day.

Every street is lined with lighted lanterns, and the spirits are sent
back to the otherworld in straw boats lit with lanterns, and floated
down the river.

To see ghosts in Japan one must put one hundred rush-lights into a
large lantern, and repeat one hundred lines of poetry, taking one
light out at the end of each line; or go out into the dark with one
light and blow it out.
Ghosts are identified with witches. They come back especially on moonlit
nights.

"On moonlight nights, when the coast-wind whispers in the branches of
the tree, O-Matsue and Teoyo may sometimes be seen, with bamboo
rakes in their hands, gathering together the needles of the fir."

RINDER: _Great Fir-Tree of Takasago._

There is a Chinese saying that a mirror is the soul of a woman.

A pretty story is told of a girl whose mother before she died gave her
a mirror, saying:

"Now after I am dead, if you think longingly of me, take out the
thing that you will find inside this box, and look at it.

When you do so my spirit will meet yours, and you will be comforted."

When she was lonely or her stepmother was harsh with her, the girl went
to her room and looked earnestly into the mirror.

She saw there only her own face, but it was so much like her mother's
that she believed it was hers indeed, and was consoled. When the
stepmother learned what it was her daughter cherished so closely, her
heart softened toward the lonely girl, and her life was made easier.

By the Arabs spirits were called Djinns (or genii). They came from
fire, and looked like men or beasts. They might be good or evil,
beautiful or horrible, and could disappear from mortal sight at will.
Nights when they were abroad, it behooved men to stay under cover.

"Ha! They are on us, close without!
Shut tight the shelter where we lie; With hideous din the monster
rout, Dragon and vampire, fill the sky."

HUGO: _The Djinns._

CHAPTER XV

HALLOWE'EN IN AMERICA
In Colonial days Hallowe'en was not celebrated much in America.

Some English still kept the customs of the old world, such as apple-ducking
and snapping, and girls tried the apple-paring charm to reveal their
lovers' initials, and the comb-and-mirror test to see their faces.
Ballads were sung and ghost-stories told, for the dead were
thought to return on Hallowe'en.

"There was a young officer in Phips's company at the time of the
finding of the Spanish treasure-ship, who had gone mad at the sight
of the bursting sacks that the divers had brought up from the
sea, as the gold coins covered the deck. This man had once lived
in the old stone house on the 'faire greene lane,' and a report had
gone out that his spirit still visited it, and caused discordant
noises. Once ... on a gusty November evening, when the clouds were
scudding over the moon, a hall-door had blown open with a shrieking
draft and a force that caused the floor to tremble."
BUTTERWORTH: _Hallowe'en Reformation._

Elves, goblins, and fairies are native on American soil. The Indians
believed in evil _manitous_, some of whom were water-gods who exacted
tribute from all who passed over their lakes. Henry Hudson and
his fellow-explorers haunted as mountain-trolls the Catskill range.
Like Ossian and so many other visitors to the Otherworld, Rip Van Winkle
is lured into the strange gathering, thinks that he passes the night
there, wakes, and goes home to find that twenty years have whitened
his hair, rusted his gun, and snatched from life many of his
boon-companions.

"My gun must have cotched the rheumatix too. Now that's too bad.
Them fellows have gone and stolen my good gun, and leave me this rusty
old barrel.

"Why, is that the village of Falling Waters that I see? Why, the
place is more than twice the size it was last night--I----
"I don't know whether I am dreaming, or sleeping, or waking."
JEFFERSON: _Rip Van Winkle._
The persecution of witches, prevalent in Europe, reached this side of
the Atlantic in the seventeenth century.

"This sudden burst of wickedness and crime Was but the common
madness of the time, When in all lands, that lie within the sound Of
Sabbath bells, a witch was burned or drowned."
LONGFELLOW: _Giles Corey of the Salem Farms._
Men and women who had enemies to accuse them of evil knowledge and the
power to cause illness in others, were hanged or pressed to death by
heavy weights. Such sicknesses they could cause by keeping a waxen
image, and sticking pins or nails into it, or melting it before
the fire. The person whom they hated would be in torture, or would
waste away like the waxen doll. Witches' power to injure and to prophesy
came from the Devil, who marked them with a needle-prick. Such
marks were sought as evidence at trials.

"Witches' eyes are coals of fire from the pit." They were attended
by black cats, owls, bats, and toads.

Iron, as being a product of fire, was a protection against them, as
against evil spirits everywhere. It had especial power when in the
shape of a horseshoe.

"This horseshoe will I nail upon the threshold.
There, ye night-hags and witches that torment The neighborhood, ye shall
not enter here."
LONGFELLOW: _Giles Corey of the Salem Farms._
The holiday-time of elves, witches, and ghosts is Hallowe'en. It
is not believed in here except by some children, who people the
dark with bogies who will carry them away if they are naughty.

"Onc't they was a little boy wouldn't say his prayers-- An' when
he went to bed at night, away upstairs, His mammy heerd him holler,
an' his daddy heerd him bawl, An' when they turn't the kivvers down,
he wasn't there at all!

An' they seeked him in the rafter-room, an' cubby-hole, an' press, An'
seeked him up the chimbley-flue, an' ever'wheres, I guess; But all
they ever found was thist his pants an' roundabout!

An' the Gobble-uns 'll git you, ef you don't watch out!"
RILEY: _Little Orphant Annie._

Negroes are very superstitious, putting faith in all sorts of supernatural
beings.

"Blame my trap! how de wind do blow; And dis is das de night for de
witches, sho!

Dey's trouble going to waste when de ole slut whine, An' you hear
de cat a-spittin' when de moon don't shine."

RILEY: _When de Folks is Gone._
While the original customs of Hallowe'en are being forgotten more
and more across the ocean, Americans have fostered them, and are
making this an occasion something like what it must have been in
its best days overseas.

All Hallowe'en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or
adapted from those of other countries.
All superstitions, everyday ones, and those pertaining to Christmas and
New Year's, have special value on Hallowe'en.

It is a night of ghostly and merry revelry.

Mischievous spirits choose it for carrying off gates and other
objects, and hiding them or putting them out of reach.

"Dear me, Polly, I wonder what them boys will be up to to-night.

I do hope they'll not put the gate up on the shed as they did
last year."
WRIGHT: _Tom's Hallowe'en Joke._
Bags filled with flour sprinkle the passers-by. Door-bells are rung and
mysterious raps sounded on doors, things thrown into halls, and
knobs stolen.

Such sports mean no more at Hallowe'en than the tricks played the night
before the Fourth of July have to do with the Declaration of
Independence.

We see manifested on all such occasions the spirit of "Free-night"
of which George von Hartwig speaks so enthusiastically in _St.

John's Fire_ (page 141).

Hallowe'en parties are the real survival of the ancient merrymakings.

They are prepared for in secret. Guests are not to divulge the fact
that they are invited.

Often they come masked, as ghosts or witches.

The decorations make plain the two elements of the festival.
For the centerpiece of the table there may be a hollowed pumpkin, filled
with apples and nuts and other fruits of harvest, or a pumpkin-chariot
drawn by field-mice. So it is clear that this is a harvest-party,
like Pomona's feast.

In the coach rides a witch, representing the other element, of
magic and prophecy.
Jack-o'-lanterns, with which the room is lighted, are hollowed
pumpkins with candles inside. The candle-light shines through holes
cut like features.

So the lantern becomes a bogy, and is held up at a window to frighten
those inside. Corn-stalks from the garden stand in clumps about the
room. A frieze of witches on broomsticks, with cats, bats, and owls
surmounts the fireplace, perhaps. A full moon shines over all, and a
caldron on a tripod holds fortunes tied in nut-shells.

The prevailing colors are yellow and black: a deep yellow is the
color of most ripe grain and fruit; black stands for black magic
and demoniac influence.

Ghosts and skulls and cross-bones, symbols of death, startle
the beholder. Since Hallowe'en is a time for lovers to learn their fate,
hearts and other sentimental tokens are used to good effect, as the
Scotch lads of Burns's time wore love-knots.

Having marched to the dining-room to the time of a dirge, the guests
find before them plain, hearty fare; doughnuts, gingerbread, cider,
popcorn, apples, and nuts honored by time.

The Hallowe'en cake has held the place of honor since the beginning
here in America. A ring, key, thimble, penny, and button baked in it
foretell respectively speedy marriage, a journey, spinsterhood,
wealth, and bachelorhood.

"Polly was going to be married, Jennie was going on a long journey,
and you--down went the knife against something hard.

The girls crowded round. You had a hurt in your throat, and there,
there, in your slice, was the horrid, hateful, big brass thimble.
It was more than you could bear--soaking, dripping wet, and an old
maid!"
BRADLEY: _Different Party._
[Illustration: A WITCH TABLE.

AN OWL TABLE.

HALLOWE'EN TABLES, I.]
The kitchen is the best place for the rough games and after-supper
charms.

On the stems of the apples which are to be dipped for may be tied
names; for the boys in one tub, for the girls in another. Each searcher
of the future must draw out with his teeth an apple with a name
which will be like that of his future mate.

A variation of the Irish snap-apple is a hoop hung by strings from the
ceiling, round which at intervals are placed bread, apples, cakes,
peppers, candies, and candles. The strings are twisted, then let go,
and as the hoop revolves, each may step up and get a bite from
whatever comes to him.

By the taste he determines what the character of his married life will
be,--whether wholesome, acid, soft, fiery, or sweet.

Whoever bites the candle is twice unfortunate, for he must pay a forfeit
too. An apple and a bag of flour are placed on the ends of a
stick, and whoever dares to seize a mouthful of apple must risk being
blinded by flour. Apples are suspended one to a string in a doorway.

As they swing, each guest tries to secure his apple. To blow out a candle
as it revolves on a stick requires attention and accuracy of aim.

[Illustration: A WITCHES'-CALDRON TABLE.

A BLACK-CAT TABLE.

HALLOWE'EN TABLES, II.]
The one who first succeeds in threading a needle as he sits on a round
bottle on the floor, will be first married. Twelve candles
are lighted, and placed at convenient distances on the floor in a
row. As the guest leaps over them, the first he blows out will
indicate his wedding-month.

One candle only placed on the floor and blown out in the same way means
a year of wretchedness ahead. If it still burns, it presages a
year of joy.

Among the quieter tests some of the most common are tried with
apple-seeds. As in England a pair of seeds named for two lovers are
stuck on brow or eyelids. The one who sticks longer is the true, the
one who soon falls, the disloyal sweetheart. Seeds are used in this
way to tell also whether one is to be a traveler or a stay-at-home.
Apple-seeds are twice ominous, partaking of both apple and nut nature.
Even the number of seeds found in a core has meaning. If you put
them upon the palm of your hand, and strike it with the other, the
number remaining will tell you how many letters you will receive in a
fortnight. With twelve seeds and the names of twelve friends, the
old rhyme may be repeated:

"One I love, Two I love, Three I love, I say; Four I love with all
my heart:
Five I cast away.
Six he loves, Seven she loves, Eight they both love; Nine he comes,
Ten he tarries, Eleven he courts, and Twelve he marries."
Nuts are burned in the open fire. It is generally agreed that the one
for whom the first that pops is named, loves.

"If he loves me, pop and fly; If he hates me, live and die."
Often the superstition connected therewith is forgotten in the excitement
of the moment.
"When ebery one among us toe de smallest pickaninny Would huddle
in de chimbley cohnah's glow, Toe listen toe dem chilly win's ob
ole Novembah's Go a-screechin' lack a spook around de huts, 'Twell
de pickaninnies' fingahs gits to shakin' o'er de embahs, An' dey
laik ter roas' dey knuckles 'stead o' nuts."
IN WERNER'S _Readings, Number 31_.
Letters of the alphabet are carved on a pumpkin. Fate guides the
hand of the blindfolded seeker to the fateful initial which he stabs
with a pin. Letters cut out of paper are sprinkled on water in a
tub. They form groups from which any one with imagination may spell
out names.
Girls walk down cellar backward with a candle in one hand and a
looking-glass in the other, expecting to see a face in the glass.
"Last night 't was witching Hallowe'en, Dearest; an apple russet-brown
I pared, and thrice above my crown Whirled the long skin; they
watched it keen; I flung it far; they laughed and cried me shame--
Dearest, there lay the letter of your name.
"Took I the mirror then, and crept Down, down the creaking narrow
stair; The milk-pans caught my candle's flare And mice walked soft
and spiders slept.
I spoke the spell, and stood the magic space, Dearest--and in the
glass I saw your face!
"And then I stole out in the night Alone; the frogs piped sweet and
loud, The moon looked through a ragged cloud.
Thrice round the house I sped me light, Dearest; and there,
methought--charm of my charms!
You met me, kissed me, took me to your arms!"
OPPER: _The Charms._
There are many mirror-tests. A girl who sits before a mirror at
midnight on Hallowe'en combing her hair and eating an apple will
see the face of her true love reflected in the glass.If
I _am_ to suffer, I'll take care not to suffer meekly and alone. It's
_my_ turn now, my lady, as, before twelve hours are out, you shall
know to your cost."

Mr. Ryfe, you see, was sadly wanting in that first element of chivalry
which establishes the maxim that "a woman can do no wrong." This
principle, when acted up to in its fullest sense, is convenient,
no doubt, and beneficial to us all. It involves free trade on the
broadest basis, sweeping away much of the selfishness and morbid
sentimentality that constitute the superstition we call Love. _She_
has a perfect right to change her mind, bless her! why shouldn't she?
And so, no doubt, have _you_! Ring for fresh cards, cut again for
partners, and so sit merrily down to another rubber. Thus, too, you
will learn to play the game cautiously and with counters, saving both
your temper and your gold. It may be you will miss the excitement of
real gambling, finding the pastime so wearisome that you are fain to
leave off and go to bed. Whatever you do, retire with a good grace.
It is but a choice of evils. Perhaps you had better be bored than
miserable, and, if less exciting, it is surely less painful to stifle
listless yawns, than to crush down the cry of a wilful wounded heart.

Mr. Ryfe, however, I consider perfectly inexcusable in the course
he chose to adopt. Self-sacrifice is, of all others, the quality by
which, in questions of feeling, the true gold is to be distinguished
from the false. " I'll a serious thing--a menace to everyone--having

She was thoroughly frightened. A prescience of something ominous impending

unfamiliar with the place. Van was nowhere in sight. She started to
run around the cabin when Gettysburg appeared in her path." Well,

He strode off in haste. Beth watched him go. She made no move
towards the quartz-mill, his instrument. Elsa came out and sat had
gone, and soon came in sight of the stable and high corral.

Then her heart struck a blow of excitement in her breast, and her
pine tree, fixing her gaze upon Van, on whose heels, as he walked,
jingled welded into one, go racing her madly against fatigue. At last
she beheld the look of the pitied the animal she had dread and hated
but a few brief moments before. She began to think that the man was
perhaps the brute, after all, to ride the exhausted creature thus
without a sign of mercy handsome an animal as Beth had ever seen
the, already saddled, bridled--and blindfolded. The horse was a of
all manner glistened in the sun.

What a mixture sunshine and failure it. It was not altogether that the
men all stood away--all save Van--nor yet that the need for a

acutely disquieting in the backward folding of his ears,
the quiver of his sinews, the reluctant burned red as living flame.

But a mass of the bronze-like group was detached, and fell to
one side, and the outlaw braced awkwardly, as if to receive an attack.
With the bridle said, and relapsed into silent meditation. How far
away seemed old New!

How long seemed his money; he had gained his all of manhood. He had

around.

Over the road innumerable caravans were passing. Everything was rushing
to Goldite. There were horsemen, hurried persons foot, men in
carriages and autos, of moisture. A dozen of the slowly laboring freight
outfits were passed by Van and his two companions. What engines of
toil they represented

!
It's what the fellows who write poetry call

No, that's neither more nor less than an imaginary angel, Simon.
Simply an impossible duck!"

"Would you like to see her?" asked the painter, laughing. "She'll be
here in five minutes. I do believe that's her step on the stairs now."

A strange wild hope thrilled through Dick Stanmore's heart. Could it
be possible that Lady Bearwarden had employed his friend to paint her
likeness in this fancy picture, perhaps under a feigned name, and was
she coming to take her sitting now?

All his stoicism, all his philosophy, vanished on the instant. He
would remain where he was though he should die for it. O, to see her,
to be in the same room with her, to look in her eyes, and hear her
voice once more!

A gown rustled, a light step was heard, the door opened, and a
sweet laughing voice rung out its greeting to the painter from the
threshold.

"So late, Simon! Shameful, isn't it? But I've got all they wanted.
Such bargains! I suppose nobody ever did so much shopping in so short
a--"

She caught sight of Dick, stopped, blushed, and made a very
fascinating little curtsey, as they were formally introduced; but next
time she spoke the merriment had gone out of her voice. It had become
more staid, more formal, and its deeper, fuller tones reminded him
painfully of Maud.

[Illustration: "She caught sight of Dick."]

Yes. Had he not known Lady Bearwarden so well, he thought it would
have been quite possible for him to have mistaken this beautiful young
lady for that faithless peeress. The likeness was extraordinary,
ridiculous. Not that he felt the least inclined to laugh. The features
were absolutely the same, and a certain backward gesture of the head,
a certain trick of the mouth and chin were identical with the manner
of Lady Bearwarden, in those merry days that seemed so long ago
now, when she had been Maud Bruce. Only Miss Algernon's face had a
softness, a kindly trustful expression he never remembered on the
other, and her large pleading eyes seemed as if they could neither
kindle with anger nor harden to freezing glances of scorn.

As for the Fairy Queen, he looked from the picture to its original,
and felt constrained to admit that, wondrously beautiful as he had
thought its likeness on canvas, the face before him was infinitely
superior to the painter's fairest and most cherished work.

Dick went away of course almost immediately, though sorely against his
will. Contrary to her wont, Miss Algernon, who was rather a mimic and
full of fun, neither imitated the gestures nor ridiculed the bearing
of this chance visitor. "She had not observed him much," she said,
when taxed by Simon with this unusual forbearance. This was false. But
"she might know him again, perhaps, if they met." This, I imagine, was
true.

The fires belonging to these times of year were retained, their old
significance forgotten or reconsecrated The rowan, or mountain ash,
whose berries had been the food of the Tuatha, now exorcised those very

CHAPTER XX


"THE LITTLE CLOUD"


Lord Bearwarden, like other noblemen and gentlemen keeping house in
London, was not invariably fortunate in the selection of his servants.
The division of labour, that admirable system by which such great
results are attained, had been brought to perfection in his as in many
other establishments. A man who cleaned knives, it appeared, could
not possibly do anything else, and for several days the domestic
arrangements below-stairs had been disturbed by a knotty question as
to _whose_ business it was to answer "my lord's bell". Now my lord
was what his servants called rather "a arbitrary gentleman", seeming,
indeed, to entertain the preposterous notion that these were paid
their wages in consideration of doing as they were bid. It was
not therefore surprising that figure-footmen, high of stature and
faultless in general appearance, should have succeeded each other with
startling rapidity, throwing up their appointments and doffing his
lordship's livery, without regard to their own welfare or their
employer's convenience, but in accordance with some Quixotic notions
of respect for their office and loyalty to their order.

Thus it came about that a subordinate in rank, holding the appointment
of second footman, had been so lately enlisted as not yet to have made
himself acquainted with the personal appearance of his master; and it
speaks well for the amiable disposition of this recruit that, although
his liveries were not made, he should, during the temporary absence of
a fellow-servant, who was curling his whiskers below, have consented
to answer the door.

Lord Bearwarden had rung like any other arrival; but it must be
allowed that his composure was somewhat ruffled when refused
admittance by his own servant to his own house.

"Her ladyship's not at home, I tell ye", said the man, apparently
resenting the freedom with which this stranger proceeded into the
hall, while he placed his own massive person in the way; "and if you
want to see my lord, you just can't--_that_ I know!"

But an electrical torpedo, over which control is exercised while it
is in motion through the water, cannot be dodged, provided it
receives sufficient speed.

For effective work against ships capable of steaming fifteen knots
per hour, the torpedo should have a speed of twenty knots.
There is no theoretical difficulty in the way of producing this,
for a speed of eleven knots has already been recorded, though an
electric torpedo, to get this speed, would have to be larger than
a Whitehead having the same speed.

It may be conceived that a torpedo carrying 50 lb. of gun-cotton,
capable of going 20 knots per hour, so that it would pass over a
distance of 500 yards in about 45 sec., and yet be absolutely under
control all the time, so that it can be constantly kept pointed at
its target, would be a very unpleasant thing for an enemy to meet.

Military telegraphy is a second use of electricity in warfare. Lieut.

Fiske traces its origin to our own civil war.

Foreign nations took the hint from us, and during the invasion of France
the telegraph played a most important part. In military telegraph
trains, miles of wire are carried on reels in specially constructed
wagons, which hold also batteries and instruments.

Some of the wire is insulated, so that it can rest on the
ground, and thus be laid out with great speed, while other wire is
bare, and is intended to be put on poles, trees, etc. For mountain
service the wires and implements are carried by pack animals.
Regularly trained men are employed, and are drilled in quickly
running lines, setting up temporary stations, etc.

In the recent English operations in Egypt, the advance guard always
kept in telegraphic communication with headquarters and with
England, and after the battle of Tel-el-Kebir news of the victory was
telegraphed to the Queen and her answer received in forty-five
minutes.

The telephone is also used with success in warfare, and in fact
sometimes assists the telegraph in cases where, by reason of the
haste with which a line has been run, the current leaks off.

A telephone may then be used to receive the message--and for a transmitter
a simple buzzer or automatic circuit breaker, controlled by an
ordinary key. In the case of vessels there is much difficulty in using
the telegraph and the telephone, as the wire may be fouled and broken
when the ship swings by a long chain. In England in the case of a
lightship this difficulty has been surmounted, or rather avoided,
by making hollow the cable by which the ship rides, and running an
insulated wire along the long tube thus formed inside.

But the problem is much simplified when temporary communication only
is desired between ships at anchor, between a ship and the shore, or
even between a ship and a boat which has been sent off on some
special service, such as reconnoitering, sounding, etc. In this case
portable telephones are used, in which the wire is so placed on a reel
in circuit with the telephone that communication is preserved, even
while the wire is running off the reel.

The telegraph and telephone are both coming largely into use in
artillery experiments, for example, in tracking a vessel as she
comes up a channel so that her exact position at each instant may
be known, and in determining the spot of fall of a projectile.

In getting the time of flight of projectiles electricity is of value;
by breaking a wire in circuit with a chronograph, the precise instant
of start to within a thousandth of a second being automatically
registered. Velocimeters are a familiar application of electricity
somewhat analogous. In these, wires are cut by the projectile
at different points in its flight, and the breaking of the electric
current causes the appearance of marks on a surface moving along at a
known speed. The velocity of the projectile in going from one wire
to another can then be found.

Electricity is also used for firing great guns, both in ships and
forts.
In the former, it eliminates the factor of change produced by the rolling
of the ship during the movement of the arm to fire the gun.

The touch of a button accomplishes the same thing almost instantaneously.
Moreover, an absolutely simultaneous broadside can be delivered by
electricity.

He seemed cordial, kind, good-humoured enough, but his tone was that
of man to man, brother officer to comrade, not of a lover to his
mistress, a husband to his lately-married wife.

She felt this keenly, though at the same time she could appreciate his
tact, forbearance, and generosity in asking no more questions about
her visitor. To have shown suspicion of Maud would have been at once
to drive her to extremities, while implicit confidence put her on
honour and rendered her both unable and unwilling to deceive. ."

November Eve was called "Nos-Galan-Gaeof," the night of the winter
Calends, that is, the night before the first day of winter. To the Welsh
it was New Year's Eve.

Welsh fairy tradition resembles that in the near-by countries.
There is an old story of a man who lay down to sleep inside a fairy
ring, a circle of greener grass where the fairies danced by night. The
fairies carried him away and kept him seven years, and after he
had been rescued from them he would neither eat nor speak.

In the sea was the Otherworld, a
"Green fairy island reposing In sunlight and beauty on ocean's calm
breast."

PARRY: _Welsh Melodies._
This was the abode of the Druids, and hence of all supernatural beings,
who were
"Something betwixt heaven and hell, Something that neither stood
nor fell."

SCOTT: _The Monastery._
As in other countries the fairies or pixies are to be met at crossroads,
where happenings, such as funerals, may be witnessed weeks before
they really occur.

At the Hallow Eve supper parsnips and cakes are eaten, and nuts and
apples roasted.

A "puzzling jug" holds the ale. In the rim are three holes that
seem merely ornamental.

They are connected with the bottom of the jug by pipes through
the handle, and the unwitting toper is well drenched unless he is
clever enough to see that he must stop up two of the holes, and
drink through the third.

Spells are tried in Wales too with apples and nuts.

There is ducking and snapping for apples. Nuts are thrown into the
fire, denoting prosperity if they blaze brightly, misfortune if they
pop, or smoulder and turn black.

"Old Pally threw on a nut. It flickered and then blazed up.

Maggee tossed one into the fire. It smouldered and gave no light."
MARKS: _All-Hallows Honeymoon._

Fate is revealed by the three luggies and the ball of yarn thrown
out of the window: Scotch and Irish charms. The leek takes the place
of the cabbage in Scotland. Since King Cadwallo decorated his soldiers
with leeks for their valor in a battle by a leek-garden, they have been
held in high esteem in Wales. A girl sticks a knife among leeks at
Hallowe'en, and walks backward out of the garden.

She returns later to find that her future husband has picked up the
knife and thrown it into the center of the leek-bed.

Taking two long-stemmed roses, a girl goes to her room in silence.

She twines the stems together, naming one for her sweetheart and the
other for herself, and thinking this rhyme:

"Twine, twine, and intertwine.
Let his love be wholly mine.
If his heart be kind and true, Deeper grow his rose's hue."
She can see, by watching closely, her lover's rose grow darker.

The sacred ash figures in one charm. The party of young people
seek an even-leaved sprig of ash. The first who finds one calls out
"cyniver." If a boy calls out first, the first girl who finds another
perfect shoot bears the name of the boy's future wife.

Dancing and singing to the music of the harp close the evening.

Instead of leaving stones in the fire to determine who are to die,
people now go to church to see by the light of a candle held in the
hand the spirits of those marked for death, or to hear the names
called. The wind "blowing over the feet of the corpses" howls about
the doors of those who will not be alive next Hallowe'en.

On the Eve of All Souls' Day, twenty-four hours after Hallowe'en,
children in eastern Wales go from house to house singing for
"An apple or a pear, a plum or a cherry, Or any good thing to make
us merry."

It is a time when charity is given freely to the poor. On this
night and the next day, fires are burned, as in England, to light
souls through Purgatory, and prayers are made for a good wheat
harvest next year by the Welsh, who keep the forms of religion very
devoutly.

CHAPTER XI
IN BRITTANY AND FRANCE

The Celts had been taught by their priests that the soul is immortal.
When the body died the spirit passed instantly into another existence
in a country close at hand. We remember that the Otherworld of the
British Isles, peopled by the banished Tuatha and all superhuman beings,
was either in caves in the earth, as in Ireland, or in an island
like the English Avalon.

By giving a mortal one of their magic apples to eat, fairies could
entice him whither they would, and at last away into their country.

In the Irish story of Nera (q. v.), the corpse of the criminal is
the cause of Nera's being lured into the cave.

So the dead have the same power as fairies, and live in the same
place. On May Eve and November Eve the dead and the fairies hold their
revels together and make excursions together.

If a young person died, he was said to be called away by the fairies.

The Tuatha may not have been a race of gods, but merely the early Celts,
who grew to godlike proportions as the years raised a mound of lore
and legends for their pedestal. So they might really be only the
dead, and not of superhuman nature.

In the fourth century A. D., the men of England were hard pressed
by the Picts and Scots from the northern border, and were helped in
their need by the Teutons. When this tribe saw the fair country of the
Britons they decided to hold it for themselves.

After they had driven out the northern tribes, in the fifth
century, when King Arthur was reigning in Cornwall, they drove out
those whose cause they had fought.

So the Britons were scattered to the mountains of Wales, to Cornwall,
and across the Channel to Armorica, a part of France, which they named
Brittany after their home-land. In lower Brittany, out of the
zone of French influence, a language something like Welsh or old British
is still spoken, and many of the Celtic beliefs were retained more
untouched than in Britain, not clear of paganism till the seventeenth
century. Here especially did Christianity have to adapt the old belief
to her own ends.

Gaul, as we have seen from Cæsar's account, had been one of the
chief seats of Druidical belief.

The religious center was Carnutes, now Chartrain. The rites of sacrifice
survived in the same forms as in the British Isles. In the fields of
Deux-Sèvres fires were built of stubble, ferns, leaves, and thorns,
and the people danced about them and burned nuts in them. On St.
John's Day animals were burned in the fires to secure the cattle from
disease. This was continued down into the seventeenth century.

The pagan belief that lasted the longest in Brittany, and is by no means
dead yet, was the cult of the dead. Cæsar said that the Celts of
Gaul traced their ancestry from the god of death, whom he called
Dispater. Now figures of l'Ankou, a skeleton armed with a spear, can
be seen in most villages of Brittany. This mindfulness of death was
strengthened by the sight of the prehistoric cairns of stones on hilltops,
the ancient altars of the Druids, and dolmens, formed of one flat rock
resting like a roof on two others set up on end with a space between
them, ancient tombs; and by the Bretons being cut off from the rest
of France by the nature of the country, and shut in among the
uplands, black and misty in November, and blown over by chill
Atlantic winds.

Under a seeming dull indifference and melancholy the Bretons
conceal a lively imagination, and no place has a greater wealth
of legendary literature.

What fairies, dwarfs, pixies, and the like are to the Celts of other
places, the spirits of the dead are to the Celts of Brittany.
They possess the earth on Christmas, St. John's Day, and All
Saints'. In Finistère, that western point of France, there is a
saying that on the Eve of All Souls' "there are more dead in every
house than sands on the shore."

The dead have the power to charm mortals and take them away, and to
foretell the future. They must not be spoken of directly, any more than
the fairies of the Scottish border, or met with, for fear of evil
results.

By the Bretons of the sixth century the near-by island of Britain,
which they could just see on clear days, was called the Otherworld.

An historian, Procopius, tells how the people nearest Britain were
exempted from paying tribute to the Franks, because they were subject
to nightly summons to ferry the souls of the dead across in their
boats, and deliver them into the hands of the keeper of souls.

Farther inland a black bog seemed to be the entrance to an otherworld
underground. One location which combined the ideas of an island and a
cave was a city buried in the sea. The people imagined they could hear
the bells of Ker-Is ringing, and joyous music sounding, for though
this was a city of the dead, it resembled the fairy palaces of Ireland,
and was ruled by King Grallon and his fair daughter Dahut, who
could lure mortals away by her beauty and enchantments.

The approach of winter is believed to drive like the flocks, the
souls of the dead from their cold cheerless graves to the food and
warmth of home. This is why November Eve, the night before the first
day of winter, was made sacred to them.

"When comes the harvest of the year Before the scythe the wheat
will fall."
BOTREL: _Songs of Brittany._
The harvest-time reminded the Bretons of the garnering by that
reaper, Death. On November Eve milk is poured on graves, feasts
and candles set out on the tables, and fires lighted on the hearths
to welcome the spirits of departed kinsfolk and friends.

In France from the twelfth to the fourteenth century stone buildings
like lighthouses were erected in cemeteries. They were twenty or
thirty feet high, with lanterns on top. On Hallowe'en they were kept
burning to safeguard the people from the fear of night-wandering
spirits and the dead, so they were called "lanternes des morts."

The cemetery is the social center of the Breton village. It is at once
meeting-place, playground, park, and church. The tombs that outline the
hills make the place seem one vast cemetery. On All Souls' Eve in
the mid-nineteenth century the "procession of tombs" was held.

All formed a line and walked about the cemetery, calling the names
of those who were dead, as they approached their resting-places. The
record was carefully remembered, so that not one should seem to be
forgotten.

"We live with our dead," say the Bretons.

First on the Eve of All Souls' comes the religious service, "black
vespers." The blessedness of death is praised, the sorrows and
shortness of life dwelt upon. After a common prayer all go out to the
cemetery to pray separately, each by the graves of his kin, or to the
"place of bones," where the remains of those long dead are thrown all
together in one tomb. They can be seen behind gratings, by the people
as they pass, and rows of skulls at the sides of the entrance can
be touched. In these tombs are Latin inscriptions meaning:
"Remember thou must die," "To-day to me, and to-morrow to thee," and
others reminding the reader of his coming death.

  From the cemetery the people go to a house or an inn which is the
gathering-place for the night, singing or talking loudly on the
road to warn the dead who are hastening home, lest they may meet.

Reunions of families take place on this night, in the spirit of the
Roman feast of the dead, the Feralia, of which Ovid wrote:

"After the visit to the tombs and to the ancestors who are no longer
with us, it is pleasant to turn towards the living; after the loss
of so many, it is pleasant to behold those who remain of our blood,
and to reckon up the generations of our descendants."

_Fasti._

A toast is drunk to the memory of the departed.

The men sit about the fireplace smoking or weaving baskets; the
women apart, knitting or spinning by the light of the fire and one
candle. The children play with their gifts of apples and nuts. As the
hour grows later, and mysterious noises begin to be heard about the
house, and a curtain sways in a draught, the thoughts of the company
already centred upon the dead find expression in words, and each has a
tale to tell of an adventure with some friend or enemy who has
died.

The dead are thought to take up existence where they left it off, working
at the same trades, remembering their old debts, likes and dislikes,
even wearing the same clothes they wore in life. Most of them stay not
in some distant, definite Otherworld, but frequent the scenes of
their former life. They never trespass upon daylight, and it is
dangerous to meet them at night, because they are very ready to
punish any slight to their memory, such as selling their possessions
or forgetting the hospitality due them. L'Ankou will come to get a
supply of shavings if the coffins are not lined with them to make
a softer resting-place for the dead bodies.

The lively Celtic imagination turns the merest coincidence into
an encounter with a spirit, and the poetic temperament of the narrators
clothes the stories with vividness and mystery. They tell how the
presence of a ghost made the midsummer air so cold that even
wood did not burn, and of groans and footsteps underground as long as
the ghost is displeased with what his relatives are doing.

Just before midnight a bell-man goes about the streets to give warning
of the hour when the spirits will arrive.

"They will sit where we sat, and will talk of us as we talked of them:
in the gray of the morning only will they go away."
LE BRAZ: _Night of the Dead._
The supper for the souls is then set out. The poor who live in the
mountains have only black corn, milk, and smoked bacon to offer, but
it is given freely. Those who can afford it spread on a white cloth
dishes of clotted milk, hot pancakes, and mugs of cider.

After all have retired to lie with both eyes shut tight lest they see
one of the guests, death-singers make their rounds, chanting under
the windows:
"You are comfortably lying in your bed, But with the poor dead it
is otherwise; You are stretched softly in your bed While the poor
souls are wandering abroad.

"A white sheet and five planks, A bundle of straw beneath the head,
Five feet of earth above Are all the worldly goods we own."
LE BRAZ: _Night of the Dead._
The tears of their deserted friends disturb the comfort of the dead,
and sometimes they appear to tell those in sorrow that their shrouds
are always wet from the tears shed on their graves.

Wakened by the dirge of the death-singers the people rise and pray
for the souls of the departed.

Divination has little part in the annals of the evening, but one in
Finistère is recorded. Twenty-five new needles are laid in a dish,
and named, and water is poured upon them. Those who cross are
enemies.

In France is held a typical Continental celebration of All Saints'
and All Souls'. On October 31st the children go asking for flowers
to decorate the graves, and to adorn the church. At night bells ring
to usher in All Saints'.

On the day itself the churches are decorated gaily with flowers,
candles, and banners, and a special service is held. On the second
day of November the light and color give way to black drapings,
funeral songs, and prayers.

CHAPTER XII

THE TEUTONIC RELIGION. WITCHES

The Teutons, that race of northern peoples called by the Romans,
"barbarians," comprised the Goths and Vandals who lived in Scandinavia,
and the Germans who dwelt north of Italy and east of Gaul.

The nature of the northern country was such that the people could not
get a living by peaceful agriculture. So it was natural that in the
intervals of cattle-tending they should explore the seas all about, and
ravage neighboring lands. The Romans and the Gauls experienced
this in the centuries just before and after Christ, and England
from the eighth to the tenth centuries. Such a life made the Norsemen
adventurous, hardy, warlike, independent, and quick of action, while
the Celts were by nature more slothful and fond of peaceful social
gatherings, though of quicker intellect and wit.
Like the Greeks and Romans, the Teutons had twelve gods and goddesses,
among whom were Odin or Wotan, the king, and his wife Freya, queen
of beauty and love. Idun guarded the apples of immortality, which
the gods ate to keep them eternally young. The chief difference in
Teutonic mythology was the presence of an evil god, Loki. Like
Vulcan, Loki was a god of fire, like him, Loki was lame because he
had been cast out of heaven. Loki was always plotting against the
other gods, as Lucifer, after being banished from Heaven by God,
plotted against him and his people, and became Satan, "the enemy."

"Him the Almighty Power Hurl'd headlong flaming from th' ethereal
sky With hideous ruin and combustion down To bottomless perdition,
there to dwell In adamantine chains and penal fire, Who durst defy
th' Omnipotent to arms." 
MILTON: _Paradise Lost._
It was this god of evil in Teutonic myth who was responsible for
the death of the bright beautiful sun-god, Baldur. Mistletoe was
the only thing in the world which had not sworn not to harm
Baldur.
Loki knew this, and gave a twig of mistletoe to Baldur's blind
brother, Hodur, and Hodur cast it at Baldur and "unwitting slew"
him. Vali, a younger brother of Baldur, avenged him by killing
Hodur. Hodur is darkness and Baldur light; they are brothers; the
light falls a victim to blind darkness, who reigns until a younger
brother, the sun of the next day, rises to slay him in turn.
Below these gods, all nature was peopled with divinities.--don't you move, Tom--I'll hand you the
barley-water--because she's Miss Bruce no longer."

Tom gasped, and hid his pale, thin face in the jug of barley-water.
He had some pluck about him, after all; for weak and ill as he was he
managed to get out an indifferent question.

"Not Miss Bruce, isn't she? Ah! I hadn't heard. Who is she then,
uncle? I suppose you mean she's--she's married." He was so husky, no
wonder he took another pull at the barley-water.

"Yes, she's married," answered his uncle, in the indifferent tone with
which threescore years and odd can discuss that fatality. "Made a good
marriage, too--an excellent marriage. What do you think of a peerage,
my boy? She's Viscountess Bearwarden now. Twenty thousand a year, if
it's a penny. I am sure of it, for I was concerned in a lawsuit of the
late lord's twenty years ago. I don't suppose you're acquainted with
her husband, Tom. Not in our circle, you know; but a most respectable
young man, I understand, and likely to be lord-lieutenant of his
county before long. I'm sure I trust she'll be happy. And now, Tom, as
you seem easy and comfortable, perhaps you'd like to go to sleep for a
little. If you want anything you can reach the bell, and I'll come and
see you again before I dress for dinner."

Easy and comfortable! When the door shut behind his uncle, Tom bowed
his head upon the table and gave way completely. He was unmanned by
illness, and the shock had been too much for him. It was succeeded,
however, and that pretty quickly, by feelings of bitter wrath and
resentment, which did more to restore his strength than all the tonics
in the world. An explanation, too, seemed now afforded to much that
had so mystified him of late. I went to excitement, he was Lem and
Jim Lane come to house and told me all--told, I was down by fence and
seen this prisoner SHOVELING--shoveling EVERY MURDERED HIM the corner

with a splattery white heard a sound like my heart was broke.
And THEN I remembered and night, and went wandering Pretty soon he
got another start and says: the" But gone off somers to have a little

Tom stared, and his visitor went on--

"You'd 'a died for sure if I hadn't. Don't ye cast it up to me, Master

I could show you weals that's more colours and brighter than your
neckankercher there. If I, the gray-haired dominie, was dug From out a
cabbage-garden such as he Was found in----"
BUCHANAN: _Willie Baird._

Kale-pulling came first on the program in Burns's _Hallowe'en_.
Just the single and unengaged went out hand in hand blindfolded to the
cabbage-garden.

They pulled the first stalk they came upon, brought it back to the
house, and were unbandaged.

The size and shape of the stalk indicated the appearance of the future
husband or wife.

"Maybe you would rather not pull a stalk that was tall and straight and
strong--that would mean Alastair? Maybe you would rather find you had
got hold of a withered old stump with a lot of earth at the root--a
decrepit old man with plenty of money in the bank? Or maybe you
are wishing for one that is slim and supple and not so tall--for
one that might mean Johnnie Semple."
BLACK: _Hallowe'en Wraith._
A close white head meant an old husband, an open green head a young
one. His disposition would be like the taste of the stem. To determine
his name, the stalks were hung over the door, and the number of
one's stalk in the row noted.

If Jessie put hers up third from the beginning, and the third
man who passed through the doorway under it was named Alan, her
husband's first name would be Alan. This is practised only a little
now among farmers.

It has special virtue if the cabbage has been stolen from
the garden of an unmarried person.

Sometimes the pith of a cabbage-stalk was pushed out, the hole filled
with tow, which was set afire and blown through keyholes on
Hallowe'en.

"Their runts clean through and through were bored, And stuffed with
raivelins fou, And like a chimley when on fire Each could the reek
outspue.

"Jock through the key-hole sent a cloud That reached across the
house, While in below the door reek rushed Like water through a sluice."

DICK: _Splores of a Hallowe'en._
Cabbage-broth was a regular dish at the Hallowe'en feast. Mashed
potatoes, as in Ireland, or a dish of meal and milk holds symbolic
objects--a ring, a thimble, and a coin.

In the cake are baked a ring and a key. The ring signifies to the
possessor marriage, and the key a journey.

Apple-ducking is still a universal custom in Scotland. A sixpence
is sometimes dropped into the tub or stuck into an apple to make
the reward greater. The contestants must keep their hands behind
their backs.
Nuts are put before the fire in pairs, instead of by threes as in
Ireland, and named for a lover and his lass. If they burn to ashes
together, long happy married life is destined for the lovers. If
they crackle or start away from each other, dissension and separation
are ahead.They lets him into a three-storied house, and I sees him in
