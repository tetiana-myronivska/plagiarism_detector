Lord Martindale started, and repeated the words in amaze. Theodora
better judged of a child's 'long time,' and asked whether it meant a day
or a week. 'Was it since the baby was born that he went?'

'Baby was a week old. He was gone one--two Sundays, and he came back all
on a sudden the day before yesterday, coughing so much that he could not
speak, and the gentleman told mamma all about it.'

'What gentleman, Johnnie? Was it Mr. Gardner?'

'O no; this was a good-natured gentleman.'

'Mr. Herries, or Captain Fitzhugh?'

'No, it was a long name, and some one I never saw before; but I think it
was the man that belongs to the owl.'

'What can the child mean?' asked Lord Martindale.

Johnnie mounted a chair, and embraced his little stuffed owl.

'The man that gave me this.'

'Percy's Athenian owl!' cried Theodora.

'Was Fotheringham the name?' said Lord Martindale.

'Yes, it was the name like Aunt Helen's,' said Johnnie.

'Has he been here since?'

'He called to inquire yesterday morning. I am not sure,' said the exact
little boy, 'but I think he said he met papa in the steamer.'

It seemed mystery on mystery, and James could only confirm his young
master's statement. After the little boy had answered all the questions
in his power he slid down from his grandfather's knee, saying that it
was bed-time, and wished them good night in a grave, sorrowful, yet
childlike manner, that went to their hearts. He returned, in a short
time, with a message that mamma thought papa a little better and ready
to see them. Theodora went up first; Johnnie led her to the door, and
then went away, while Violet said, almost inaudibly,

'Here is Theodora come to see you.'

Prepared as Theodora was, she was startled by the bloodlessness of the
face, and the hand that lay without movement on the coverlet, while the
gaze of the great black eyes met her with an almost spectral effect; and
the stillness was only broken by the painful heaving of the chest,
which seemed to shake even the bed-curtains. But for Violet's looks and
gesture, Theodora would not have dared to go up to him, take his hand,
and, on finding it feebly return her pressure, bend over and kiss his
forehead.

'His breath is certainly relieved, and there is less fever,' repeated
Violet; but to Theodora this seemed to make it only more shocking.
If this was better, what must it not have been? for sick monks, the
archdeacon in dogs monastery. Prohibitions of a particular hunted

Even thought and anxiety seemed to be gone; she sat where
they placed her, and when they began to undress her, put her hand
mechanically to her dress, missed the fastening, and let it drop with
a vacant smile that almost overcame Theodora. They laid her in bed,
and she dropped asleep, like an infant, the instant her head was on the
pillow. Theodora thought it cruel to arouse her to take nourishment; but
Sarah was peremptory, and vigorously administered the spoonfuls, which
she swallowed in the same unconscious manner. She was only roused a
little by a sound from the baby: 'Give him to me, he will be quieter
so;' and Sarah held him to her, she took him in her arms, and was
instantly sunk in the same dead slumber.

'My pretty lamb!' mourned the cold stern servant, as she arranged her
coverings; 'this is the sorest brash we have had together yet, and I
doubt whether ye'll win through with it. May He temper the blast that
sends it.'

Gazing at her for a few seconds, she raised her hand to dry some large
tears; and as if only now conscious of Miss Martindale's presence,
curtsied, saying, in her usual manner, 'I beg your pardon, ma'am. There
is the room next the nursery made ready for you.'

'I could not go, Sarah, thank you. Go to your children; I will take care
of her. Pray go.'

'I will, thank you, ma'am. We will have need of all our strength before
we have done.'

'How has she been before this?'

'About as well as usual at first, ma'am, till he threw her back with
going off into they foreign parts, where he has been and as good as
catched his death, and would have died if Mr. Fotheringham had not
brought him home.'

'What! has he been abroad, Sarah?'

'Yes, ma'am. I was holding the baby when he says to Missus he was going
to Bully, or Boulong--'

'Boulogne--'

'Yes, Bullying, or some such place; and bullied him they have; stripped
him even of his very portmanteau, with his eight new shirts in it, that
they have! Well, Missus, she says his cold would be worse, and he said
it only wanted a change, and she need never fret, for he meant to get
quit of the whole concern. But for that, I would have up and told him he
didn't ought to go, and that he must stay at home and mind her, but then
I thought, if he did get rid of them nasty horses, and that there Mr.
Gardner, with his great nasturtions on his face, it would be a blessed
day. But I ought to have known how it would be: he is too innocent for
them; and they have never been content till they have been and got
his very clothes, and given him his death, and broke the heart of the
bestest and most loving-heartedest lady as ever lived. That they have!'

Having eased her mind by this tirade, Sarah mended the fire, put every
comfort in Miss Martindale's reach, advised her to lie down by her
mistress, and walked off.

Theodora felt giddy and confounded with the shocks of that day. It was
not till she had stretched herself beside Violet that she could collect
her perceptions of the state of affairs; and oh! what wretchedness! Her
darling brother, round whom the old passionate ardour of affection
now clung again, lying at death's door; his wife sinking under her
exertions;--these were the least of the sorrows, though each cough
seemed to rend her heart, and that sleeping mother was like a part of
her life. The misery was in that mystery--nay, in the certainty, that
up to the last moment of health Arthur had been engaged in his reckless,
selfish courses! If he were repentant, there was neither space nor power
to express it, far less for reparation. He was snatched at once from
thoughtless pleasure and disregard of religion--nay, even of the common
charities of home! And to fasten the guilt to herself were those few
half-uttered words--races, debts, Gardner!

'If you once loosen the tie of home, he will go back to courses and
companions that have done him harm enough already.' 'Beware of Mark
Gardner!' 'Whatever comes of these races, it is your doing, not mine.'
Those warnings flashed before her eyes like letters of fire, and she
turned her face to the pillow as it were to hide from them, as well as
to stifle the groans that could not have been wrung from her by bodily
pain. 'Oh, my sin has found me out! I thought I had been punished,
but these are the very dregs! His blood is on my head! My brother! my
brother! whom I loved above all! He was learning to love his home and
children; she was weaning him from those pursuits! What might he not
have been? I led him away! When he shrank from the temptation, I dragged
him to it! I gave him back to the tempter! I, who thought I loved him--I
did the devil's work! Oh! this is the heavier weight! Why should it
crush others with the only guilty one? Oh! have mercy, have mercy on
him! Let me bear all! Take me instead! Let me not have slain his soul!'

It was anguish beyond the power of words. She could not lie still; she
knelt on the floor, and there the flood of despair fell on her more
overwhelmingly; and crouching, almost cast on the ground, she poured out
incoherent entreaties for mercy, for space for his repentance, for his
forgiveness. That agony of distracted prayer must have lasted a long
time. Some sound in her brother's room alarmed her, and in starting she
shook the table. Her father came to ask if anything was the matter; told
her that Arthur was quiet, and begged her to lie down. It was a relief
to have something to obey, and she moved back. The light gleamed on
something bright. It was the setting of Helen's cross! 'Ah! I was not
worthy to save it; that was for Johnnie's innocent hand! I may not call
this my cross, but my rod!' Then came one thought: 'I came not for the
righteous, but to call sinners to repentance.' ", according to some learned
natives, was not in existence four hundred years ago; from which we
ignore nothing of it till the discoveries and conquests of the in revived
India opened the Red Sea to! the natives of." Mrs.The hope, the
motive, and comfort in praying, had gleamed across her again; and not
with utter despair could she beseech that the sins she had almost caused
might be so repented of as to receive the pardon sufficient for all
iniquity.


CHAPTER 10


     Thus have I seen a temper wild
       In yokes of strong affection bound
     Unto a spirit meek and mild,
       Till chains of good were on him found.
     He, struggling in his deep distress,
     As in some dream of loneliness,
       Hath found it was an angel guest.

     --Thoughts in Past Years


Five days had passed, and no material change had taken place. There was
no serious recurrence of bleeding, but the inflammation did not abate,
and the suffering was grievous, though Arthur was so much enfeebled
that he could not struggle under it. His extreme debility made his body
passive, but it was painfully evident that his mind was as anxious and
ill at ease as ever. There was the same distrustful watch to see every
letter, and know all that passed; the constant strain of every faculty,
all in absolute silence, so that his nurses, especially Theodora, felt
as if it would be a positive personal relief to them if those eyes would
be closed for one minute.

What would they have given to know what passed in that sleepless mind?
But anything that could lead to speaking or agitation was forbidden;
even, to the great grief of Theodora, the admission of the clergyman
of the parish. Lord Martindale agreed with the doctors that it was too
great a risk, and Violet allowed them to decide, whispering to Theodora
that she thought he heeded Johnnie's prayers more than anything read
with a direct view to himself. The cause of his anxiety remained in
doubt. Lord Martindale had consulted Violet, but she knew nothing of
any papers. She was aware that his accounts were mixed up with Mr.
Gardner's, and believed he had gone to Boulogne to settle them; and she
conjectured that he had found himself more deeply involved than he had
expected. She remembered his having said something of being undone, and
his words to Johnnie seemed to bear the same interpretation.

Mr. Fotheringham's apparition was also a mystery; so strange was it
that, after bringing Arthur home in such a state, he should offer no
further assistance. James was desired to ask him to come in, if he
should call to inquire; but he did not appear, and the father and sister
began to have vague apprehensions, which they would not for the world
have avowed to each other, that there must be worse than folly, for what
save disgrace would have kept Percy from aiding John's brother in his
distress? Each morning rose on them with dread of what the day might
bring forth, not merely from the disease within, but from the world
without; each postman's knock was listened to with alarm, caught from
poor Arthur.

His wife was of course spared much of this. That worst fear could not
occur to her; she had no room for any thought but for him as he was in
the sight of Heaven, and each hour that his life was prolonged was to
her a boon and a blessing. She trusted that there was true sorrow for
the past--not merely dread of the consequences, as she traced the
shades upon his face, while he listened to the hymns that she encouraged
Johnnie to repeat. In that clear, sweet enunciation, and simple,
reverent manner, they evidently had a great effect. He listened for the
first time with his heart, and the caresses, at which Johnnie glowed
with pleasure as a high favour, were, she knew, given with a species of
wondering veneration. said the weapon, and his as they may never neglect
thee distressing when thy need grant it me, by the edge the shoulder
baron,'and what dost here?'' I seek refuge and hospitality,' replied the
stranger; a'and I raise thee baby to of thy horse, by of thy is at the
utmost.'Johnnie, on his side, was never so well
satisfied as in the room, and nothing but Violet's fears for his health
prevented the chief part of his time from being spent there.

Her own strength was just sufficient for the day. She could sit by
Arthur's side, comprehend his wishes by his face, and do more to relieve
and sustain him than all the rest; and, though she looked wretchedly
weak and worn, her power of doing all that was needed, and looking upon
him with comforting refreshing smiles, did not desert her. The night
watch she was forced to leave to be divided between his father and
sister, with the assistance alternately of Sarah and the regular nurse,
and she was too much exhausted when she went to bed, for Theodora to
venture on disturbing her by an unnecessary word.

Theodora's longing was to be continually with her brother, but this
could only be for a few hours at night; and then the sight of his
suffering, and the difficulty of understanding his restlessness of
mind, made her so wretched, that it took all the force of her strong
resolution to conceal her unhappiness; and she marvelled the more at the
calmness with which the feeble frame of Violet endured the same scene.
The day was still more trying to her, for her task was the care of the
children, and little Helen was so entirely a copy of her own untamed
self, as to be a burdensome charge for a desponding heart and sinking
spirits.

On the fifth morning the doctors perceived a shade of improvement; but
to his attendants Arthur appeared worse, from being less passive and
returning more to the struggle and manifestation of oppression and
suffering. He made attempts at questions, insisting on being assured
that no letter nor call had been kept from him; he even sent for the
cards that had been left, and examined them, and he wanted to renew the
conversation with his father; but Lord Martindale silenced him at
once, and left the room. He looked so much disappointed that Violet was
grieved, and thought, in spite of the doctors, that it might have
been better to have run the risk of letting him speak, for the sake of
setting his mind at rest.

The only absent artefact of his apparel consisted and in a large ruby
of uncommon brilliancy itself had emitted the rays which it merely,
which, any when he approached the light, seemed to glow with such
liveliness, as if the reflected back.The children were out of doors, and Theodora was profiting by the
interval of quiet to write to her mother, when she heard James announce,
'Mr. Fotheringham.'
