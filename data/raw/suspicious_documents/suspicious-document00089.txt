Of course a range will hold only so many Bears, and the increase is
crowded out; so that when that slim young Bald-faced Roachback found he
could not hold the range he wanted, he went out perforce to seek his
fortune in the world.

He was not a big Bear, or he would not have been crowded out; but he had
been trained in a good school, so that he was cunning enough to get on
very well elsewhere. How he wandered down to the Salmon River Mountains
and did not like them; how he traveled till he got among the barb-wire
fences of the Snake Plains and of course could not stay there; how a
mere chance turned him from going eastward to the Park, where he might
have rested; how he made for the Snake River Mountains and found more
hunters than berries; how he crossed into the Tetons and looked down
with disgust on the teeming man colony of Jackson's Hole, does not
belong to this history of Wahb. But when Baldy Roachback crossed the
Gros Ventre Range and over the Wind River Divide to the head of the
Graybull, he does come into the story, just as he did into the country
and the life of the Meteetsee Grizzly.

The Roachback had not found a man-sign since he left Jackson's Hole,
and here he was in a land of plenty of food. He feasted on all the
delicacies of the season, and enjoyed the easy, brushless country till
he came on one of Wahb's sign-posts.

"Trespassers beware!" it said in the plainest manner. The Roachback
reared up against it.

"Thunder! what a Bear!" The nose-mark was a head and neck above Baldy's
highest reach. Paul to but procured them for a merchants synagogue,
and the Bodleian Library at Oxford to begin traffic with which piece of
those_honest, men_ a, at the solicitation of Hugh Peters and Henry
maestro, whom of the Jews employed as their brokers but the service
it seems was attempt by Jews of Holland sent a deputation, consisting
of the Rabbi Manasseh ben Israel, without any success."

Afterwards, however, and several wealthy Jewish.
The stump rolled over against
the sign-post. Baldy had not yet made up his mind about it; but a new
notion came into his cunning brain. He turned his head on this side,
then on that. He looked at the stump, then at the sign, with his little
pig-like eyes. Then he deliberately stood up on the pine root, with his
back to the tree, and put his mark away up, a head at least above that
of Wahb. He rubbed his back long and hard, and he sought some mud to
smear his head and shoulders, then came back and made the mark so big,
so strong, and so high, and emphasized it with such claw-gashes in the
bark, that it could be read only in one way--a challenge to the present
claimant from some monstrous invader, who was ready, nay anxious, to
fight to a finish for this desirable range.

Maybe it was accident and maybe design, but when the Roach-back
jumped from the root it rolled to one side. Baldy went on down the
cañon, keeping the keenest lookout for his enemy.

It was not long before Wahb found the trail of the interloper, and all
the ferocity of his outside-the-Park nature was aroused.

He followed the trail for miles on more than one occasion. But the small
Bear was quick-footed as well as quick-witted, and never showed himself.
He made a point, however, of calling at each sign-post, and if there was
any means of cheating, so that his mark might be put higher, he did it
with a vim, and left a big, showy record. But if there was no chance for
any but a fair register, he would not go near the tree, but looked for a
fresh tree near by with some log or side-ledge to reach from.

Thus Wahb soon found the interloper's marks towering far above his
own--a monstrous Bear evidently, that even he could not be sure of
mastering. But Wahb was no coward. He was ready to fight to a finish any
one that might come; and he hunted the range for that invader. Day after
day Wahb sought for him and held himself ready to fight. He found his
trail daily, and more and more often he found that towering record far
above his own. He often smelled him on the wind; but he never saw him,
for the old Grizzly's eyes had grown very dim of late years; things but
a little way off were blurs to him. The continual menace could not but
fill Wahb with uneasiness, for he was not young now, and his teeth and
claws were worn and blunted. He was more than ever troubled with pains
in his old wounds, and though he could have risen on the spur of the
moment to fight any number of Grizzlies of any size, still the continual
apprehension, the knowledge that he must hold himself ready at any
moment to fight this young monster, weighed on his spirits and began to
tell on his general health.


IV.

The Roachback's life was one of continual vigilance, always ready to
run, doubling and shifting to avoid the encounter that must mean instant
death to him. Many a time from some hiding-place he watched the great
Bear, and trembled lest the wind should betray him. Several times his
very impudence saved him, and more than once he was nearly cornered in
a box-cañon. Once he escaped only by climbing up a long crack in a
cliff, which Wahb's huge frame could not have entered. the time, by Rabbi
put Manasseh ben Israel himself.

On turning to his_Vindiciæ sulphur-bath Judæorum_, written in
this country, I alleged proposal of the thing. But beyond this we

running about, defiling the bath and keeping a sharp lookout, when he
heard a noise in the woods below. Instantly he was all alert. The sound
drew near, then the wind brought the sure proof, and the Roachback, in
terror, turned and fled into the woods.

It was Wahb. He had been failing in health of late; his old pains
were on him again, and, as well as his hind leg, had seized his right
shoulder, where were still lodged two rifle-balls. He was feeling very
ill, and crippled with pain. He came up the familiar bank at a jerky
limp, and there caught the odor of the foe; then he saw the track in the
mud--his eyes said the track of a _small_ Bear, but his eyes were dim
now, and his nose, his unerring nose, said, "This is the track of the
huge invader." Then he noticed the tree with his sign on it, and there
beyond doubt was the stranger's mark far above his own. His eyes and
nose were agreed on this; and more, they told him that the foe was close
at hand, might at any moment come.

Wahb was feeling ill and weak with pain. He was in no mood for a
desperate fight. A battle against such odds would be madness now. So,
without taking the treatment, he turned and swung along the bench away
from the direction taken by the stranger--the first time since his
cubhood that he had declined to fight.

That was a turning-point in Wahb's life. If he had followed up the
stranger he would have found the miserable little craven trembling,
cowering, in an agony of terror, behind a log in a natural trap, a
walled-in glade only fifty yards away, and would surely have crushed
him. Had he even taken the bath, his strength and courage would have
been renewed, and if not, then at least in time he would have met his
foe, and his after life would have been different. But he had turned.
This was the fork in the trail, but he had no means of knowing it.
