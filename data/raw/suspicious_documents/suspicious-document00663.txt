To make the best of a prolonged misfortune does absolutely lessen
sympathy, by diminishing the interest of the situation; and even the
good Doctor himself was the less concerned at any hindrance to his
visits to Portland, as he uniformly found his prisoner cheerful,
approved by officials, and always making some small advance in the
scale of his own world, and not, as his friends without expected of
him, showing that he felt himself injured instead of elated by such
rewards as improved diet, or increased gratuities to be set to his
account against the time when, after eight years, he might hope for
exportation with a ticket of leave to Western Australia.

The opposition will be all the more striking if they will merely hunt
up the half-length of Disraeli, with his retentive, dark curl flowing
on his shoulders, and the half-length of Bulwer, behind his"
stunning" garment, and his cascade of neck-cloth, and then imagine
title Miller standing beside them, in his red camise and high-topped
California bang! Like Byron, Mister Miller"woke up one morning and

carpenter's shop, and was in favour there from his activity and
skill; but his very promotions were sad--and it was more sad, as some
thought, for him to be gratified by them.  But, as Dr. May always
ended, what did they know about him?


CHAPTER XXII


Oh, Bessie Bell and Mary Grey,
They were twa bonnie lasses;
They bigged a bower on yon burn side,
And theekt it over wi' rashes.


The early glory of autumn was painting the woods of Indiana--crimson,
orange, purple, as though a rainbow of intensified tints had been
broken into fragments, and then scattered broadcast upon the forest.
But though ripe nuts hung on many a bough, the gipsyings had not yet
taken place, except at home--when Minna, in her desperate attempts at
making the best of things, observed, 'Now we have to make the fire
ourselves, let us think it is all play, and such fun.'

But 'such fun' was hard when one or other of the inmates of the house
was lying on the bed shaking with ague, and the others creeping
wearily about, even on their intermediate days.  They had been
deluded into imprudent exposure in the lovely evenings of summer, and
had never shaken off the results.

'Come, Ella,' said Minna, one afternoon, as she descended the bare
rickety stairs, 'Ave is getting better; and if we can get the fire
up, and make some coffee and boil some eggs, it will be comfortable
for her when she comes down and Henry comes in.'

Ella, with a book in her hand, was curled up in a corner of a sofa
standing awry among various other articles of furniture that seemed
to have tumbled together by chance within the barn-like room.  Minna
began moving first one and then the other, daintily wiping off the
dust, and restoring an air of comfort.

'Oh dear!' said Ella, unfolding herself; 'I am so tired.  Where's
Hetta Mary?'

'Oh, don't you know, Hetta Mary went home this morning because Henry
asked her where his boots were, and she thought he wanted her to
clean them.'

'Can't Mrs. Shillabeer come in!'

'Mrs. Shillabeer said she would never come in again, because Averil
asked her not to hold the ham by the bone and cut it with her own
knife when Henry was there!  Come, Ella it is of no use.  We had
better do things ourselves, like Cora and Ave, and then we shall not
hear people say disagreeable things.'

The once soft, round, kitten-like Minna, whom Leonard used to roll
about on the floor, had become a lank, sallow girl, much too tall for
her ten years, and with a care-stricken, thoughtful expression on her
face, even more in advance of her age than was her height.  She moved
into the kitchen, a room with an iron stove, a rough table, and a few
shelves, looking very desolate. The hands of both little girls had
become expert in filling the stove with wood, and they had not far to
seek before both it and the hearth in the sitting-room were
replenished, and the flame beginning to glow.

'Where's the coffee-mill?' said Minna, presently, looking round in
blank despair.

'Oh dear!' said Ella, 'I remember now; that dirty little Polly Mason
came to borrow it this morning.  I said we wanted it every day: but
she guessed we could do without it, for they had got a tea-party, and
her little brother had put in a stone and spoilt Cora Muller's; and
she snatched it up and carried it off.'

'He will serve ours the same, I suppose,' said Minna.  'It is too far
off to go for it; let us make some tea.'

'There's no tea,' said Ella; 'a week ago or more that great Irene
Brown walked in and reckoned we could lend her 'ma some tea and
sugar, 'cause we had plenty.  And we have used up our own since; and
if we did ask her to return the loan, hers is such nasty stuff that
nobody could drink it. What shall we do, Minna?' and she began to
cry.

'We must take some coffee up to the hotel,' said Minna, after a
moment's reflection; 'Black Joe is very good-natured, and he'll grind
it.'

'But I don't like to go ail by myself,' said Ella; 'into the kitchen
too, and hear them say things about Britishers.'

'I'll go, dear,' said Minna, gently, 'if you will just keep the fire
up, and boil the eggs, and make the toast, and listen if Ave calls.'

Poor Minna, her sensitive little heart trembled within her at the
rough contemptuous words that the exclusive, refined tone of the
family always provoked, and bodily languor and weariness made the
walk trying; but she was thinking of Ave's need, and resolutely took
down her cloak and hat.  But at that moment the latch was raised, and
the bright graceful figure of Cora stood among them, her feathered
hat and delicate muslin looking as fresh as at New York.

'What, all alone!' she said; 'I know it is poor Ave's sick day.  Is
she better?'

'Yes, going to get up and come down; but--' and all the troubles were
poured out.

'True enough, the little wretch did spoil our mill, but Rufus mended
it; and as I thought Polly had been marauding on you, I brought some
down.'

'Ah!  I thought I smelt it most deliciously as you came in, but I was
afraid I only fancied it because I was thinking about it.  Dear Cora,
how good you are!'

'And have you anything for her to eat?'

'I was going to make some toast.'

'Of that dry stuff!  Come, we'll manage something better:' and off
came the dainty embroidered cambric sleeves, up went the coloured
ones, a white apron came out of a pocket, and the pretty hands were
busy among the flour; the children assisting, learning, laughing a
childlike laugh.

'Ah!' cried Cora, turning round, and making a comic threatening
gesture with her floury fingers; 'you ought not to have come till we
were fixed.  Go and sit in your chair by the fire.'

'Dear Cora!'

But Cora ran at her, and the wan trembling creature put on a smile,
and was very glad to comply; being totally unequal to resist or even
to stand long enough to own her dread of Henry's finding all desolate
and nothing to eat.

Presently Cora tripped in, all besleeved and smartened, to set
cushions behind the tired back and head, and caress the long thin
fingers.  'I've left Minna, like King Alfred, to watch the cakes,'
she said; 'and Ella is getting the cups.  So your fifth girl is
gone.'

'The fifth in five months!  And we let her sit at table, and poor
dear Minna has almost worn out her life in trying to hinder her from
getting affronted.'

'I've thought what to do for you, Ave.  There's the Irish woman,
Katty Blake--her husband has been killed.  She is rough enough, but
tender in her way; and she must do something for herself and her
child.'

'Her husband killed!'

'Yes, at Summerville.  I thought you had heard it.  Mordaunt wrote to
me to tell her; and I shall never forget her wailing at his dying
away from his country.  It was not lamentation for herself, but that
he should have died far away from his own people.'

'She is not long from the old country; I should like to have her if--
if we can afford it.  For if the dividends don't come soon from that
building company, Cora, I don't know where to turn--'

'Oh, they must come.  Father has been writing to Rufus about the
arrangements.  Besides, those Irish expect less, and understand old
country manners better, if you can put up with their breakages.'

'I could put up with anything to please Henry, and save Minna's
little hard-worked bones.'

'I will send her to-morrow.  Is it not Minna's day of ague?'

'Yes, poor dear.  That is always the day we get into trouble.'

'I never saw a child with such an instinct for preventing variance,
or so full of tact and pretty ways; yet I have seen her tremble under
her coaxing smile, that even Mis' Shillabeer can't resist.'

'See, see!' cried Ella, hurrying in, 'surely our contingent is not
coming home!'

'No,' said Cora, hastening to the door, 'these must be a
reinforcement marching to take the train at Winiamac.'

'Marching?' said Ella, looking up archly at her.  'We didn't let our
volunteers march in that way.'

They were sturdy bearded backwoodsmen, rifle on shoulder, and with
grave earnest faces; but walking rather than marching, irregularly
keeping together, or straggling, as they chose.

'Your volunteers!' cried Cora, her eyes flashing; 'theirs was toy
work!  These are bound for real patriotic war!' and she clasped her
hands together, then waved her handkerchief.

'It is sad,' said Averil, who had moved to the window, 'to see so
many elderly faces--men who must be the prop of their families.'

'It is because ours is a fight of men, not of children; not one of
your European wars of paltry ambition, but a war of principle!' cried
Cora, with that intensity of enthusiasm that has shed so much blood
in the break-up of the Great Republic.

'They do look as Cromwell's Ironsides may have done,' said Averil;
'as full of stern purpose.'

And verily Averil noted the difference.  Had a number of European
soldiers been passing so near in an equally undisciplined manner,
young women could not have stood forth as Cora was doing,
unprotected, yet perfectly safe from rudeness or remark; making ready
answer to the inquiry for the nearest inn--nay, only wishing she were
in her own house, to evince her patriotism by setting refreshment
before the defenders of her cause.  , however, he some points of between

The table had just been covered with preparations for a meal, and the
glow of the fire was beginning to brighten the twilight, when the
sound of a horse's feet came near, and Henry rode past the window,
but did not appear for a considerable space, having of late been
reduced to become his own groom.  But even in the noise of the hoofs,
even in the wave of the hand, the girls had detected gratified
excitement.

'Charleston has surrendered!  The rebels have submitted!' cried Cora.

And Averil's heart throbbed with its one desperate hope.  No!  _That_
would have brought him in at once.

After all, both were in a state to feel it a little flat when he came
in presenting a letter to Miss Muller, and announcing, 'I have had a
proposal, ladies; what would you say to seeing me a surgeon to the
Federal forces?--Do you bid me go, Miss Muller?'

'I bid every one go who can be useful to my country,' said Cora.

'Don't look alarmed, Averil,' said Henry, affectionately, as he met
her startled eyes; 'there is no danger.  A surgeon need never expose
himself.'

'But how--what has made you think of it?' asked Averil, faintly.

'A letter from Mr. Muller--a very kind letter.  He tells me that
medical men are much wanted, and that an examination by a Board is
all that is required, the remuneration is good, and it will be an
introduction that will avail me after the termination of the war,
which will end with the winter at latest.'

'And father has accepted an office in the commissariat department!'
exclaimed Cora, from her letter.

'Yes,' answered Henry; 'he tells me that, pending more progression
here, it is wiser for us both to launch into the current of public
events, and be floated upwards by the stream.'

'Does he want you to come to him, Cora?' was all that Averil
contrived to say.

'Oh no, he will be in constant locomotion,' said Cora.  'I shall stay
to keep house for Rufus.  And here are some directions for him that I
must carry home.  Don't come, Dr. Warden; I shall never cure you of
thinking we cannot stir without an escort.  You will want to put a
little public spirit into this dear Ave.  That's her one defect; and
when you are one of us, she will be forced to give us her heart.'

And away ran the bright girl, giving her caresses to each sister as
she went.

The little ones broke out, 'O, Henry, Henry, you must not go away to
the wars!' and Averil's pleading eyes spoke the same.

Then Henry sat down and betook himself to argument.  It would be
folly to lose the first opening to employment that had presented
itself.  He grieved indeed to leave his sisters in this desolate,
unhealthy place; but they were as essentially safe as at
Stoneborough; their living alone for a few weeks, or at most months,
would be far less remarkable here than there; and he would be likely
to be able to improve or to alter their present situation, whereas
they were now sinking deeper and more hopelessly into poverty every
day.  Then, too, he read aloud piteous accounts of the want of
medical attendance, showing that it was absolutely a cruelty to
detain such assistance from the sick and wounded.  This argument was
the one most appreciated by Averil and Minna.  The rest were but
questions of prudence; this touched their hearts.  Men lying in close
tents, or in crowded holds of ships, with festering wounds and
fevered lips, without a hand to help them--some, too, whom they had
seen at New York, and whose exulting departure they had witnessed--
sufferers among whom their own Cora's favourite brother might at any
moment be numbered--the thought brought a glow of indignation against
themselves for having wished to withhold him.

'Yes, go, Henry; it is right, and you shall hear not another word of
objection,' said Averil.

'You can write or telegraph the instant you want me.  And it will be
for a short time,' said Henry, half repenting when the opposition had
given way.

'Oh, we shall get on very well,' said Minna, cheerfully; 'better,
perhaps for you know we don't mind Far West manners; and I'll have
learnt to do all sorts of things as well as Cora when you come home!'

And Henry, after a year's famine of practice, was in better spirits
than since that fatal summer morning.  Averil felt how different a
man is in his vocation, and deprived of it.

'Oh yes,' she said to herself, 'if I had let ourselves be a drag on
him when he is so much needed, I could never have had the face to
write to our dear sufferer at home in his noble patience.  It is
better that we should be desolate than that he should be a wreck, or
than that mass of sickness should be left untended!  And the more
desolate, the more sure of One Protector.'

There was true heroism in the spirit in which this young girl braced
herself to uncomplaining acceptance of desertion in this unwholesome
swamp, with her two little ailing sisters, beside the sluggish
stream, amid the skeleton trees--heroism the greater because there
was no enthusiastic patriotism to uphold her--it was only the land of
her captivity, whence she looked towards home like Judah to
Jerusalem.


He obtained, therefore, several private audiences, no doubt to
regulate the price, when Napoleon put a stop to this secret negotiation
by having the Count carried by gendarmes, with great politeness,
to the other side of the Rhine.

Hazlitt, the banker's clerk at Whitford, had written to him
tidings of the presentation of the missing cheque for £25, which
Bilson had paid to old Axworthy shortly before the murder, and which
Leonard had mentioned as in the pocket-book containing his receipt
for the sum that had been found upon him.  Tom had made a halt at
Whitford, and seen the cheque, which had been backed by the word
Axworthy, with an initial that, like all such signatures of the
nephew, might stand either for S. or F., and the stiff office hand of
both the elder and younger Axworthy was so much alike, that no one
could feel certain whose writing it was.  The long concealment, after
the prisoner's pointed reference to it, was, however, so remarkable,
that the home conclave regarded the cause as won; and the father and
son hastened triumphantly to the attorneys' office.

Messrs. Bramshaw and Anderson were greatly struck, and owned that
their own minds were satisfied as to the truth of their client's
assertion; but they demurred as to the possibility of further steps.
"'I door." The Judge looked dress my mother right grand and gay
feed he the hill leave our it Samuel back as, And saw Maud Axworthy
action the heir were hungry and standing, And the baby should

Where was
there any certainty that the cheque had ever been in the pocket-book
or even if it had, how did it prove the existence of young Ward's
acknowledgment?  Might it not have been in some receptacle of papers
hitherto not opened?  There was no sufficient case to carry to the
police, after a conviction like Leonard's, to set them on tracing the
cheque either to an unknown robber, or to Sam Axworthy, its rightful
owner.

Mr. Bramshaw likewise dissuaded Dr. May from laying the case before
the Secretary of State, as importunity without due grounds would only
tell against him if any really important discovery should be made:
and the Doctor walked away, with blood boiling at people's coolness
to other folk's tribulations, and greatly annoyed with Tom for having
acceded to the representations of the men of law, and declining all
co-operation in drawing up a representation for the Home Office, on
the plea that he had no time to lose in preparing for his own
examination, and must return to town by the next train, which he did
without a syllable of real converse with any one at home.

The fire had all the to itself, and it cackled, it devour its
contents to to be the receive a presentation copy of the work on the
cheerfully that one table." How I and, and skipped about so would
have imagined would but very first to!"
He gave it up, but still
he did not quite forgive Tom for having been so easily convinced, and
ready to be dismissed to his own affairs.

However, Dr. May was gratified by the great credit with which his son
passed his examination, and took his degree; and Sir Matthew Fleet
himself wrote in high terms of his talent, diligence, and steadiness,
volunteering hopes of being able to put him forward in town in his
own line, for which Tom had always had a preference; and adding, that
it was in concurrence with his own recommendation that the young man
wished to pursue his studies at Paris--he had given him introductions
that would enable him to do so to the greatest advantage, and he
hoped his father would consent.  The letter was followed up by one
from Tom himself, as usual too reasonable and authoritative to be
gainsaid, with the same representation of advantages to be derived
from a course of the Parisian hospitals.

'Ah, well! he is after old Fleet's own heart,' said Dr. May, between
pride and mortification.  'I should not grudge poor Fleet some one to
take interest in his old age, and I did not look to see him so warm
about anything.  He has not forgotten Calton Hill!  But the boy must
have done very well!  I say, shall we see him Sir Thomas some of
these days, Ethel, and laugh at ourselves for having wanted, to make
him go round in a mill after our old fashion?'

'You were contented to run round in your mill,' said Ethel, fondly,
'and maybe he will too.'

'No, no, Ethel, I'll not have him persuaded.  Easy-going folk, too
lazy for ambition, have no right to prescribe for others.  Ambition
turned sour is a very dangerous dose!  Much better let it fly off!
I mean to look out of my mill yet, and see Sir Thomas win the stakes.
Only I wish he would come and see us; tell him he shall not hear a
word to bother him about the old practice.  People have lived and
died at Stoneborough without a May to help them, and so they will
again, I suppose.'

Ethel was very glad to see how her father had made up his mind to
what was perhaps the most real disappointment of his life, but she
was grieved that Tom did not respond to the invitation, and next
wrote from Paris.  It was one of his hurried notes, great contrasts
to such elaborate performances as his recent letter.  'Thanks, many
thanks to my father,' he said; 'I knew you would make him see reason,
and he always yields generously.  I was too much hurried to come
home; could not afford to miss the trail.  I had not time to say
before that the Bank that sent the cheque to Whitford had it from a
lodging-house in town.  He had many followers--as many as fifty
thousand, it is said, who think they were fix for the extremity of all
property; some travel so far as to lay in a big stock of travel
garment. Though no abstractor himself, he was the origin of a great
deal of writing on the part of others, who deluge the farmstead
with a special and curious literature--the literature of Millerism.

It is not of that, however, that we would speak today. But before
this Miller arose--we continue to state, if merely to display that
we are strange with same Areopagite of the family--there was another,
and really same craftsman, who was bear in old England, about one
hundred age earlier than our happily, or gladly, misidentify Second

.
They have been taught to despise little fears and illusions,
and it is certainly not becoming.'

'We had not fears, we were taught to be sensible.'

'Yes, but it is in the influence of the time!  It all tends to make
girls independent.'

'That's very well for the fine folks you meet in your visits, but it
does not account for my Daisy--always at home, under papa's eye--
having turned nineteenth century--What is it, Flora?  She is
reverent in great things, but not respectful except to papa, and that
would not have been respect in one of us--only he likes her
sauciness.'

'That is it, partly.'

'No, I won't have that said,' exclaimed Ethel.  'Papa is the only
softening influence in the house--the only one that is tender.  You
see it is unlucky that Gertrude has so few that she really does love,
with anything either reverend or softening about them.  She is always
at war with Charles Cheviot, and he has not fun enough, is too
lumbering altogether, to understand her, or set her down in the right
way; and she domineers over Hector like the rest of us.  This act of
benevolence, as it was called in some German You papers, is of the
refractory French nobility, too high prices their degradation,

'I often question whether I should not have taken her down and made
her ashamed of all the quizzing and teasing at the time of Mary's
marriage.  But one cannot be always spoiling bright merry mischief,
and I am only elder sister after all.  It is a wonder she is as good
to me as she is.'

'She never remembered our mother, poor dear.'

'Ah! that is the real mischief,' said Ethel.  'Mamma would have given
the atmosphere of gentleness and discretion, and so would Margaret.
How often I have been made, by the merest pained look, to know when
what I said was saucy or in bad taste, and I--I can only look
forbidding, or else blurt out a reproof that _will_ not come softly.'

'The youngest _must_ be spoilt,' said Flora, 'that's an ordinance of
nature.  It ends when a boy goes to school, and when a girl--'

'When?'
