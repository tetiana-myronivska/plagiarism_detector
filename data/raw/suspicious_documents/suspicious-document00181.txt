Receding were disgrace, Sooner ghost than the. thyself invited--
Which at pondered thy seeking wouldst see for her ladyship And
private. What freed!Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
                                          Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;
                                          This it is and nothing more."

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door--
                                          Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"--
                                          Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore--
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
                                          'Tis the wind and nothing more.

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
                                          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
                                          Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                                          With such name as "Nevermore."

But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour
Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--
Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends have flown before--
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."
                                          --a young fresh heart, sir; one That Cupid has not toyed with, born,
till hunger drives him out, Or plunder breaketh through his each

He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards
he was a man to be respected and even feared.  He prided himself on
his connoisseurship in wine.  Few Italians have the true virtuoso
spirit.  For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the
time and opportunity-- to practise imposture upon the British and
Austrian  millionaires.  In painting and gemmary, Fortunato,
like his countrymen, was a quack-- but in the matter of old wines he
was sincere.  In this respect I did not differ from him
materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and
bought largely whenever I could.

It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of
the carnival season, that I encountered my friend.  He accosted me
with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.  The man wore
motley.  He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his
head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.  I was so pleased
to see him, that I thought I should never have done wringing his
hand.

I said to him--"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.  How
remarkably well you are looking to-day!  But I have received a pipe
of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts."

"How?" said he.  "Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!  And in
the middle of the carnival!" 

"I have my doubts," I replied; "and I was silly enough to pay
the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. 
You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain."

"Amontillado!"

"I have my doubts."

"Amontillado!"

He raised it to his lips with a leer.  He paused and nodded to
me familiarly, while his bells jingled.

"I drink," he said, "to the buried that repose around us."

"And I to your long life."

He again took my arm, and we proceeded.

"These vaults," he said, "are extensive."

"The Montresors," I replied, "were a great and numerous
family."

"I forget your arms."

"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a
serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel."

"And the motto?"

" Nemo me impune lacessit."

"Good!" he said.

again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw
a few feeble rays upon the figure within.

A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly
from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently
back.  For a brief moment I hesitated-- I trembled.  Unsheathing my
rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought
of an instant reassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric
of the catacombs, and felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I
replied to the yells of him who clamoured.  I re-echoed-- I aided--
I surpassed them in volume and in strength.  I did this, and the
clamourer grew still.

It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  My
dear, you may return to your seat."
Annie, whose face was partly hidden by her curly hair during the
greater part of this speech, now tossed it back, and raised her brown
eyes with a look of adoration in them to her teacher. Mrs.But now

"Yes," I said, "for the love of God!"

In consequence, she rose from her knees with a feeling of strength and
sweetness which even the feeblest prayer when uttered in earnest
can always give.

The prayer-gong now sounded, and all the girls assembled in the
chapel.

There came forth in reply only a jingling
of the bells.  Yes; I am certainly sure.'
"'I have always been told, Annie,' Mrs. Willis said, 'that you are
the only girl in the school who can draw these caricatures. You
have never seen an attempt at this kind of drawing among your
schoolfellows, or among any of the teachers?'For the half
of a century no mortal has disturbed them.   In pace requiescat!
