CHAPTER I

THE QUARRY

     "An Elephant of Rock, I have lain here in the desert for
     countless ages, watching, waiting. I wonder for what!"

                                          MUSINGS OF THE ELEPHANT.


Little Jim sat at the quarry edge and dangled his legs over the derrick
pit. The derrick was out of commission because once more the lift cable
had parted. Big Jim Manning, Little Jim's father, was down in the pit
with Tomasso, his Italian helper, disentangling the cables, working
silently, efficiently, as was his custom.

He reasons imperfectly. He chooses without appropriate motives. He needs
the building up and development given by educational training. _Nature
points out the method._
Sensibility being the characteristic of his mind, we must appeal to him
through his senses.

We must use the concrete; through it we must act upon his weak will and
immature judgment. From his natural curiosity we must develop attention.
His naturally strong perceptive powers must be made yet stronger;
they must be led in proper directions and fixed upon appropriate
objects.

He must be led to appreciate the relation between cause and effects--to
associate together related facts--and to state what he knows in a
definite, clear, and forcible manner.

Object lessons, conversational lessons, lessons on animals, lessons based
on pictures and other devices, have been used to meet this demand of
the child's mental make up. Good in many respects, and vastly better than
mere book work, they have faults which I shall point out in connection
with the corresponding advantages of easy lessons in the elements
of science.

I shall not quibble over definitions. Object lessons may, perhaps, properly
be said to include lessons such as it seems to me should be given--lessons
drawn from natural philosophy or chemistry--but I use the term
here in the sense in which it is often used, as meaning lessons based
upon some object. A thimble, a knife, a watch, for instance, each
of these being a favorite with a certain class of object teachers, may
be taken.

The objections are:

1. Little new knowledge can be given which is simple and appropriate.

Most children already know the names of such objects as are chosen, the
names of the most prominent parts, the materials of which they are
composed and their uses.

Much that is often given should be omitted altogether if we fairly regard
the economy of the child's time and mental strength.

It doesn't pay to teach children that which isn't worth remembering,
and which we don't care to have them remember.

2.

Study of the qualities of materials is a prominent part of lessons
on objects.

Such study is really the study of physical science, but with objects
such as are usually selected is a very difficult part to give to
young children.

Ask the student who has taken a course in chemistry whether the study of
the qualities of metals and their alloys is easy work.

Ask him how much can readily be shown, and how much must be taken
on authority.

Have him tell you how much or how little the thing itself suggests, and
how much must he memorized from the mere book statement and with
difficulty. Study of materials is good to a certain extent, but
it is often carried much too far.

Consider a conversational lesson on some animal.

Lessons are sometimes given on cats. As an element in a reading lesson--to
arouse interest--to hold the attention--to secure correct emphasis
and inflection--to make sure of the reading being good: such work
is appropriate.

But let us see what the effect upon the pupil is as regards the
knowledge he gains of the cat, and the effect upon his habits of thought
and study.

The student gives some statement as to the appearance--the size--or
some act of his cat.

It is usually an imperfect statement drawn from the imperfect
memory of an imperfect observation. And the teacher, having only a
_general knowledge_ of the habits of cats, can correct in only a general
way. Thus habits of faulty and incorrect observation and inaccurate
memory are fastened upon the child. It is no less by the correction
of the false than by the presenting of the true, that we educate
properly.

Besides this there is the fact that traits, habits, and peculiarities of
animals are not always manifested when we wish them to be. Suppose a
teacher asks a child to notice the way in which a dog drinks, for example;
the child may have to wait until long after all the associated facts, the
reasons why this thing was to be observed--the lesson as a whole of
which this formed a part--have all grown dim in the memory, before
the chance for the observation occurs.

Pictures are less valuable as educational aids than objects; at
best they are but partially and imperfectly concrete.

The study of pictures tends to cultivate the imagination and taste,
but observation and judgment are but little exercised.

A comparison of the kind of knowledge gained in either of the above
ways with that gained by a study of science as such, will make some
of the advantages of the latter evident. An act of complete knowledge
consists in the identifying of an attribute with a subject. Attributes
of quality--of condition--of relation, may be gained from lessons
in which objects or pictures are used.

Attributes of action which are unregulated by the observer may be learned
from the study of animals. But very little of actions and changes
which can be made to take place under specified conditions, and with
uniformity of result, can be learned until physical science is drawn
upon.

And yet consider the importance of such study. Changes around him
appeal most strongly to the child. "Why _does_ this thing _do_ as it
_does_?" is more frequent than "Why _is_ this thing as it _is_?" He sees
changes of place, of form, of size, of composition, taking place;
his curiosity is aroused; and he is ready to study with avidity,
and in a systematic manner, the changes which his teacher may present
to him.

Consider the peculiarities belonging to the study of changes of any
sort. The interest is held, for the mind is constantly gaining the new.
The attention cannot be divided--all parts of the change, all phases of
the action, must be known, and to be known must be _observed_; while in
other forms of lessons the attention may be diverted for a moment to
return to the consideration of exactly what was being observed
before.

It goes without saying that in one case quick and accurate observation, a
retentive memory, and the association of causes and effects follow,
and that in the other they do not.

I advocate, therefore, the teaching of physical science in our
schools--_in all our schools_.

Physical science taught by the experimental method.

An experiment has been defined as a question put to Nature, a question
asked in _things_ rather than in _words_, and so conditioned that no
uncertain answer can be given. Nature says that all matter gravitates,
not in words, but in the swing of planets around the sun, and in the
leap of the avalanche. And men have devised ingenious machines through
which Nature may tell us the invariable laws of gravitation, and give
some hint as to why it is true.

There are two kinds of experiments, and two corresponding kinds of
investigators.

I. In original investigation there are the following elements:

1. The careful determination of all the conditions under which the
experiment takes place.

2.

The observation of exactly what happens, with a painstaking elimination
of all previous notions as to what ought to happen.

3.

The change of conditions, one at a time, with a comparison of the
results obtained with the changes made, in order to determine that
each condition has been given just its appropriate weight in the
experiment.

4.

The classification and explanation of the result.

5. The extension of the knowledge gained by turning it to investigations
suggested by what has already been learned.

6. The practical application of the knowledge gained.

II. In ordinary experiments for educational purposes the experimenter
follows in a general way in the footsteps of the original
investigator.
There are the following elements to be considered:

1. The arrangement of conditions in general imitation of the original
investigator.

This arrangement needs only to be general.

For example, if an original investigation were undertaken to determine
the composition of a metallic oxide, the metal and the oxygen would
both be carefully saved to be measured and weighed and fully tested.

The ordinary experiment would be considered successful if oxygen and the
metal were shown to result.

2.

The careful consideration of what should happen.

3 The determination that the expected either does or does not happen,
with examination of reasons and elimination of disturbing causes
in the latter case.

4.

The accepting as true of the classification and explanation already
given.

Theories, explanations, and laws are thus accepted every day by minds which
could never have originated either them or the experiments from which
they were derived.

The method of original investigation, strictly considered, presents many
difficulties. A long course of preliminary training--a thorough
knowledge of what has been done in a given field already--a quick
imagination--a genius for devising forms of apparatus which will
enable him to work well under particular conditions in the most
simple and effective way--the faculty of suspending judgment, and
of seeing what happens, all that happens, and just how it
happens--patience--caution--courage--quick judgment when a completed
experiment presses for an explanation--these are some of the
characteristics which must belong to the original worker.

Were we all capable of doing such work there would be these advantages,
among others, of studying for ourselves:

1. What we find out for ourselves we remember longer and recall
more readily than what we acquire in any other way. This advantage holds
true whether the facts learned are entirely new or only new to us.

Almost every man whose life has been spent in study has a store of facts
which he discovered, and on which he built hopes of future greatness
until he found out later that they were old to the knowledge of the
world he lived in.

And these things are among those which will remain longest in his memory.

2.

Associated facts would be learned in studying in this way which would
remain unknown otherwise.

But all the advantages would be associated with disadvantages too. Long
periods of time would have to be given for comparatively small
results.
The history of science is full of instances in which years were spent
in the elaboration of some law, or principle, or theory which the school
boy of to-day learns in an hour and recites in a breath.

Why does water rise in a pump? Do all bodies, large and small, fall
equally fast? The principles which answer and explain such questions can
be made so clear and evident to the mind of a pupil that he would almost
fancy they must have been known from the first instead of having waited
for the hard, earnest labor of intellectual giants. And science has
gone on, and for us and for our pupils would still go on, only as
accompanied with numerous mistakes and disappointments.

What method shall we adopt in the teaching of science? It must differ
according to the age and capacity of the pupils. An excellent
modification of the method of original investigation may be arranged
as follows:
The children are put in possession of all facts relating to conditions,
the teacher explaining them as much as may be necessary.

The experiment is performed, the pupils being required to observe
exactly what takes place, the experiments selected being of such a
nature that any previous judgment as to what ought to occur is as
nearly impossible as may be.

We predict from knowledge, real or supposed, of facts which are
associated in our minds with any new subject under consideration.

Children often know in a general, vague, and indefinite way that which,
for the sake of a full and systematic knowledge, we may desire
them to study. What they know will unconsciously modify their
expectations, and their expectations in turn may modify their
observations.

We are apt to believe that happens which we expect will happen. There
ought to be no difficulty, however, in finding simple and appropriate
experiments with which the child is entirely unacquainted, and in
which anything beyond the wildest guess work is, for him, impossible.

The principal use which can be made of this method is in the mere observation
of what takes place.

Nothing which the child notices correctly need be rejected, no matter how
far removed from the chief event on the object of the experiment.
Care that the pupil shall see all, and separate the essential from the
accidental, is all that is necessary.

But the original investigator assigns reasons, and with care the
children may be allowed to attempt that. This, however, should not be
carried far; incorrect explanations should be criticised; and the class
should at length be given all the elements of the correct explanation
which they have not determined for themselves.

Later, pupils should be encouraged to name related phenomena, to
mention things which they have seen happen which are due to associated
causes, and to suggest variations for the experiment and tests for its
explanation.

Good results may be made to follow this kind of work even with very
young pupils. A child grows in mental strength by using the powers
he has, and mistakes seen to be such are not only steps toward a correct
view of the subject under consideration, but are steps toward that
habit of mind which spontaneously presents correct views at once in
study which comes later in life.

Another method is this: The pupil may know what is expected to happen,
as well as the conditions given, and held responsible for an observation
of what does happen and a comparison of what he really observes with what
he expects to observe. Explanations are usually given a class, often
in books with which they are furnished, instead of being drawn from
them, in whole or in part, by questioning, when physical science
is studied in this way.

Indeed, this method is a necessity when text books are used, unless
experiments from some outside source are introduced.

Who shall perform the experiments?

With young pupils everywhere, and in most of our common, and even in
many of our graded schools, the experiments must be performed by
the teacher.

With young pupils the time is too limited, and the responsibility
and necessary care too great to permit of any other plan being
practical.

In many of our schools the small supply of apparatus renders this
necessary even with larger pupils. Added to the reasons already given
is the important one that in no other way--by no other plan--can
the teacher be as readily sure that his pupils observe and reason
fully for themselves.

In this normal school a course in physics, in which the experiments
are all performed in the class room by the teacher, is followed
by a course in chemistry, in which the members of the class perform
the experiments for themselves in the laboratory.

And, notwithstanding the age, maturity, and previous observation
of the pupils, a great deal must be done both in the laboratory and
in the recitation room to be sure that all that happens is seen--that
the purpose is clearly held in the mind--that the reason is fully
understood.

With older pupils and greater facilities, however, the experiments
should be performed by the pupils themselves. Constant watchfulness is
necessary, it is true, to insure to the pupil the full educational
value of the experiment.

With this watchfulness it can be done, and the advantages are numerous.
Among them are:

1. The learning of the use and care of apparatus.

2. The learning of methods of actual construction, from materials at
hand, of some of the simpler kinds of apparatus.

3. The learning of the importance of careful preparation. An experiment
may be performed in a few minutes before a class which has taken
an hour or more of time in its preparation.

The pupil fully appreciates its importance, and is in the best
condition to remember it only when he has had a part of the hard
work attending that preparation.

Again, conditions under which an experiment is successfully performed
are often not appreciated when merely stated in words.

"To prepare hydrogen gas, pass a thistle tube and a delivery tube through
a cork which fit tightly in the neck of a bottle," etc., is simple
enough. Let a pupil try with a cork which does not fit tightly and he
will never forget that condition.

4.

The learning of the importance of following directions. Chemistry,
especially, is full of those cases where this means everything.
Sometimes, not often in experiments performed in school, however,
it may mean even life or death.

The time for experiments should be carefully considered. When performed
by the teacher they should be taken up during the recitation:

1. If used as a foundation to build upon, at the beginning of the
lesson.

2. If used as a summary, at the close.

3. They should be closely connected with the points which they
illustrate.

4.

When very short, or when so difficult as to demand the whole attention
of the teacher, they may be given and afterward discussed. If long
or easy, they may be discussed while the work is going on. Changes which
take place slowly, as those which are brought about by the gradual
action of heat, for instance, are best taken up in this latter
way.

5.

Exceptions may be necessary, as when experiments which demand special
preparation immediately before they are presented are given when
the recitation begins, or cases in which experiments are kept until
near the close of a recitation, when the teacher finds that attention
flags and the lesson seems to have lost its interest to the pupils
as soon as the experiments have been given.I have done a real man's part. I have worked to the
limit of my strength and I shall survive for America through my
fertility. What I have done to America, no one knows."

But 'Masso was no thinker. Before he slipped away, he only said some
futile word to the priest who knelt beside him. 'Masso never had gotten
very far from the thought of his Maker.

Big Jim, lying on the border of the fields where his fathers had dreamed
and hoped and worked, looked hazily at Little Jim, and tried to say
something, but couldn't. Once more the sense of having his back to the
wall, the pack suffocating him, closed in on him, blinded him, and
merged with him into the darkness into which none of us has seen.

Had Big Jim been able to clarify the chaos of thoughts in his mind and
had he had a longer time for dying, he might have done the thing far
more dramatically. He merely rasped out his life, a bloody, voiceless,
broken thing on the golden August fields, with his chaos of thoughts
unspoken.

He might, had things been otherwise, have seen the long, sad glory of
humanity's migrations; might have caught for an unspeakable second a
vision of that never ceasing, never long deflected on-moving of human
life that must continue, regardless of race tragedy, as long as humans
crave food either for the body or the soul. He might have seen himself
as symbolizing one of those races that slip over the horizon into
oblivion, unprotesting, only vaguely knowing. And seeing this thing, Big
Jim might have paused and looking into the face of the horde that was
pressing him over the brim, he might have said:

"We who are about to die, salute thee!"

But Big Jim was not dramatic. Little Jim never knew what his father
might have said. Instinct told the boy when the end had come. His dry
sobs changed to the abandoned tears of childhood as he ran down the
street of elms and besotted mansions to tell his mother.


CHAPTER II

THE OLD SWIMMING HOLE

     "The same sand that gave birth to the coyote and the eagle
     gave birth to the Indian and to me. I wonder why!"

                                          MUSINGS OF THE ELEPHANT.


Little Jim and his mother were left very much alone by Big Jim's death.
Little Jim was literally the last of the Mannings. Mrs. Manning's only
relative, her sister, had died when Jim was a baby. There was no one to
whom Mrs. Manning felt that she could turn for help.

Jim pleaded to be allowed to quit school and go to work.

"I'm fourteen, Mama, and as big as lots of men. I can take care of you."

Mrs. Manning had not cried much. Her heartbreak would not give into
tears easily. But at Jim's words she broke into hysterical sobs.

"Jimmy! Jimmy! I don't see how you can ever think of such a thing after
all Papa said to you. Almost his last advice to you was about getting an
education. He was so proud of your school work. Why, all I've got to
live for now is to carry out Papa's plans for you."

Jimmy stood beside his mother. He was taller than she. Suddenly, with
boyish awkwardness, he pulled the sobbing little woman to him and leaned
his young cheek on her graying hair.

"Mama, I'll make myself into a darned college professor, if you just
won't cry!" he whispered.

For several days after the funeral, Jim wandered about the house and
yard fighting to control his tears when he came upon some sudden
reminder of his father; the broken rake his father had mended the week
before; a pair of old shoes in the wood shed; one of his father's pipes
on the kitchen window ledge. The nights were the worst, when the picture
of his father's last moments would not let the boy sleep. It seemed to
Jim that if he could learn to forget this picture a part of his grief
would be lifted. It was the uselessness of Big Jim's death that made the
boy unboyishly bitter. He could not believe that any other death ever
had been so needless. It was only in the years to come that Jim was to
learn how needlessly, how unremittingly, industry takes its toll of
lives.

Somehow, Jim had a boyish feeling that his father had had many things to
say to him that never had been said; that these things were very wise
and would have guided him. Jim felt rudderless. He felt that it was
incumbent on him to do the things that his father had not been able to
do. Vaguely and childishly he determined that he must make good for the
Mannings and for Exham. Poor old Exham, with its lost ideals!

It was in thinking this over that Jim conceived an idea that became a
great comfort to him. He decided to write down all the advice that he
could recall his father's giving him, and when his mother became less
broken up, to ask her to tell him all the plans his father might have
had for him.

So it was that a week or so after her husband's death, Mrs. Manning
found one of Jim's scratch pads on the table in his room, with a
carefully printed title on the cover:

                    MY FATHER'S ADVICES TO ME.

After she had wiped the quick tears from her eyes, she read the few
pages Jim had completed in his sprawling hand:

"My father said to me, 'Jimmy, never make excuses. It's always too late
for excuses.'

"He said, 'A liar is a first cousin to a skunk. There isn't a worse
coward than a liar.'

"He said to me, 'Don't belly-ache. Stand up to your troubles like a
man.'

"My father said, 'Hang to what you undertake like a hound to a warm
scent.'

"He said to me, 'Life is made up of obeying. What you don't learn from
me about that, the world will kick into you. The stars themselves obey a
law. God must hate a law breaker.'

"My father said, 'Somehow us Americans are quitters.'

"My mother said my father said, 'I want Jimmy to go through college. I
want him to marry young and have a big family.'

"The thing my father said to me oftenest lately was, 'Jimmy, be clean
about women. Some day you will know what I mean when I say that sex is
energy. Keep yourself clean for your life work and your wife and
children.'"

Mrs. Manning read the pages over several times, then she laid the book
down and stood staring out of the window.

"Oh, he was a good man!" she whispered. "He was a good man! If Jimmy
could have had him just two years more! I don't know how to teach him
the things a man ought to know. A boy needs his father.----Oh, my love!
My love----"

Down below, Jim was leaning on the front gate. His chum, Phil Chadwick,
was coming slowly up the street. The boys had not been near Jim since
the funeral. Jim had become a person set apart from their boy world. No
one appreciates the dignity of grief better than a boy, or underneath
his awkwardness has a finer way of showing it. Phil's mother, to his
unspeakable discomfort, had insisted now that he go call on Jim.

Phil, his round face red with embarrassment, approached the gate a
little sidewise.

"Hello, Still!" he said casually.

"Hello, Pilly!" replied Jim, blushing in sympathy.

There was a pause, then said Phil, leaning on the gate, "Diana's got her
pups. One's going to be a bulldog and two of 'em are setters.
U-u-u--want to come over and see 'em and choose yours?"

Jim's face was quivering. The children liked to skip stones and see them
spin up and down in the foam; but they had been warned not to go too
near the bank.

Nobody had ever fallen in yet, but it wasn't a safe place for very
little folks, certainly not for roly-poly babies like Bubby Proudfit.

He was very clumsy, falling down, rolling over, and picking himself up
again every five minutes. Patty meant to watch him, but he was not
very interesting, and the little girls quite bewitched her with
their kind smiles and pretty ways.

Flaxie Frizzle was one of the youngest, but led off in most of the
games. She was little Eva, and died on a bed of grass "elegantly," while
everybody else groaned and howled, especially poor Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom
was Milly, in a black mask of Preston's, which had been played
with till it was cracked in fifty places, and made Uncle Tom look
about two hundred years old.

Then they had the "Old Woman in the Shoe," and Flaxie was a fierce
and cruel mother, whipping her children so "soundly" that you could
hear them scream half a mile off.

Patty thought all this was beautiful, and a longing look came into her
bold black eyes, as she gazed at the old woman.

"Oh, if _I_ could wear red stockings, with flowers on them, like Flaxie!

If _I_ could be a doctor's little girl, and live in a house with blinds
and trees and flowers, and have a cousin come to see _me_!"
It wasn't strange that Patty should feel like this, and want to
cover up her bare feet in the grass; but in admiring Flaxie she
forgot entirely to watch Bubby, and that was a great mistake.

_He_ didn't care, he never liked to be watched; it was fine fun to see
the whole world before him and go just where he chose. Didn't the trees
and grass and flowers all belong to him! To be sure they did, and he
meant to carry some of them home. But while he was trudging about, and
making up his little mind where he would begin to pull, he espied the
river sparkling in the sun, and that was finest of all. "Pitty, pitty!"
cried he, and thought he would carry the river home too. How nice it
would be to splash in! He fairly shouted at the idea, for having never
seen a bath-tub, he hadn't learned to be afraid of soap and water.

"Pitty, pitty!" said he, toddling down with outstretched hands toward
the dashing, dancing, merry, white cascade; while the children, running
away from the terrible old woman, and trying to see which could
scream loudest, never saw or heard him at all.

Ah, baby, foolish baby, do you think you can seize that bright river
and carry it home? No, it is the bright river that is going to seize
_you_, unless somebody stops your little feet before they get to the
brink!

About this time Preston Gray had finished reciting his lesson. It was not
a very good one, though his teacher found no fault whatever; and
now instead of going home, Preston strolled along toward the
"Children's Park," thinking how strange it was that little girls
should scream so much louder than boys at their games.

"Flaxie is a gay one," said he, as he saw her chasing her children with
a white birch switch; but at that moment he saw something else
that made his heart stand still.

The Proudfit baby was scrambling down the bank, just above the
falls!

Preston called out, but it was of no use; there was not a man to
be seen, and if there had been twenty men they could have heard
nothing, while the little girls were making such a noise.

He ran with all his might, but by the time he reached the bank, the baby
had tumbled headlong into the river!

What was to be done?

Preston was only a little boy himself, let me tell you, and though
he had learned to swim, the current was strong right here, and there
was great danger of his being carried over the falls.

What would _you_ have done, my little reader?

Perhaps you would have stopped to think a good many times, saying
to yourself:

"Oh, I don't dare, I don't dare!"

And then, ah, _then_, it might have been too late!

Preston was called a slow boy, but he didn't stop to think once; he
did his thinking while he was pulling off his shoes.

"I must do it!"

that was all he thought. And then he dashed in.

Bubby was in deep water already, and his struggles were carrying
him down stream.

Preston seized him by his calico frock, and tried to drag him toward the
bank; but that dreadful baby had always had a habit of nipping at
everything like a snapping-turtle, and now he caught Preston's
throat between his thumb and forefinger, half strangling him.

And, oh, the current was so swift!

For a moment it was life or death with both of them; but Preston managed
to unclasp the tiny hand, hold it down, and land the poor little
fellow safe at last.

"God helped me--I knew he would!"

thought brave Preston Gray, as he drew his first long breath on the
bank.

Of course all the little girls had gathered around him, screaming in chorus,
and it was a noisy procession that followed the weeping Patty
down the street, with the dripping baby in her arms.

"'Twas my brother that saved him, 'twas my brother Preston!" cried Flaxie
to everybody they met.

"He jumped into the river and pulled out the baby!"
That wasn't the end of it.

There was another procession in the evening, and this one stopped at
Dr. Gray's gate. It was the Brass Band, out in uniform; but Preston
hadn't the least idea what for, till the men paused at the end of a
tune, swung their caps, and gave "Three cheers for Master Preston
Gray!"
Even then he didn't understand. He hid behind his father and thought he
_should_ like to know what his mother was crying about.

"Hurrah!" said the leader again, Major Patten, swinging his tall
fur cap, which was the pride of the whole company; "hurrah for the
boy that risked his life to save a drowning baby!"

"Oh, is that it? Anybody'd have done that!"

thought little Preston, hiding again. He was a modest boy; but his sister
Flaxie, you know, was quite too bold.

"Why don't he come out?"

whispered she, pulling at his sleeve.

"Hush, let him alone," said Dr.

Gray, with tears in his eyes.

And then he raised the noble boy in his arms, so the men could see
him, for that was what they wanted.

But still Preston hid his face. His heart was full, and he _couldn't_
look up when those people were praising him so.

By this time there were lamps lighted in every window of Dr.

Gray's house, and even in the trees; and though the moon was shining
her best, Major Patten, with the wonderful fur cap, asked Preston
to stand beside him and hold a lamp, that he might see to read his
music.

Preston stood there with the light shining on his pure, good face;
and then the men played, "See the Conquering Hero comes," the
"Marsellaise," and a dozen other tunes, while their uniforms made
such a dazzle of red and gold that Flaxie could not help dancing
about like a wild thing for joy.

It was not so with thoughtful Milly. She snuggled down on the piazza
beside Julia, and looked on quietly.

"I'm glad Preston was so good," thought she; "perhaps he wouldn't
have been so very good if he hadn't had those blind eyes and
spectacles.

How God must love him! Papa says Julia is like a little candle, and
I'm sure Preston is like a candle too. Why, where _is_ Flaxie going now?"

Flaxie was flying down the hill after Henry, the stable-boy. She had heard
her papa tell him to go to Mr.

Springer's for some ice-cream, and she wanted to say: "Get it pink,
Henry; get the pinkest ice-cream you can find!"
Then when the men were seated all about the yard and on the piazza,
eating their pink ice-cream, somebody threw up a rocket; and that
was the end of the gayest, brightest evening our little friend
Flaxie Frizzle had ever known in her life

"The authoress of The Little Prudy Stories would be elected

"The children will not be left without healthful entertainment and
kindly instruction so long as Sophie May (Miss Rebecca S.

Clarke) lives and wields her graceful pen in their behalf, Miss Clarke
has made a close and loving study of childhood, and she is almost
idolized by the crowd of 'nephews and nieces' who claim her as aunt.

Nothing to us can ever be quite so delightfully charming as were
the 'Dotty Dimple' and the 'Little Prudy' books to our youthful
imagination, but we have no doubt the little folks of to-day will
find the story of 'Flaxie Frizzle' and her young friends just as
fascinating.

There is a sprightliness about all of Miss Clarke's books that attracts
the young, and their purity, their absolute cleanliness, renders
them invaluable in the eyes of parents and all who are interested
in the welfare of children."-- Morning Star.

"Genius comes in with 'Little Prudy.'

Compared with her, all other book-children are cold creations of
literature; she alone is the real thing.

All the quaintness of children, its originality, its tenderness and
its teasing, its infinite uncommon drollery, the serious earnestness
of its fun, the fun of its seriousness, the naturalness of its
plays, and the delicious oddity of its progress, all these united
for dear Little Prudy to embody them."

LITTLE PRUDY.

"I have been wanting to say a word about a book for children, perfect
of its kind--I mean Little Prudy. It seems to me the greatest book of
the season for children. The authoress has a genius for story-telling.

Prudy's letter to Mr. 'Gustus Somebody must be genuine; if an invention,
it shows a genius akin to that of the great masters. It is a
positive kindness to the little ones to remind their parents that
there is such a book as Little Prudy."

--Springfield Republican.

LITTLE PRUDY'S SISTER SUSIE.

"Every little girl and boy who has made the acquaintance of that
funny 'Little Prudy' will be eager to read this book, in which she
figures quite as largely as her bigger sister, though the joys and
troubles of poor Susie make a very interesting story."

--Portland Transcript.

"Certainly one of the most cunning, natural, and witty little books
we ever read."

--Hartford Press.

LITTLE PRUDY'S CAPTAIN HORACE.

"These are such as none but Sophie May can write, and we know not
where to look for two more choice and beautiful volumes--Susie for
girls and Horace for boys.

They are not only amusing and wonderfully entertaining, but teach
most effective lessons of patience, kindness, and truthfulness.

Our readers will find a good deal in them about Prudy, for so many
things are always happening to her that the author finds it impossible
to keep her out."

"This story book is a great favorite with the little folks, for it contains
just such stories as they like to hear their aunt and older sister
tell; and learn them by heart and tell them over to one another as
they set out the best infant tea-set, or piece a baby-quilt, or
dress dolls, or roll marbles.

A book to put on the book-shelf in the playroom where Susie and Prudy,
Captain Horace, Cousin Grace, and all the rest of the 'Little
Prudy' folks are kept."

--Vermont Record.

LITTLE PRUDY'S COUSIN GRACE.

"An exquisite picture of little-girl life at school and at home,
and gives an entertaining account of a secret society which originated
in the fertile brain of Grace, passed some comical resolutions at
first, but was finally converted into a Soldier's Aid Society.

Full of life, and fire, and good advice; the latter sugar-coated, of
course, to suit the taste of little folks."--Press.

LITTLE PRUDY'S DOTTY DIMPLE.

"Dotty Dimple is the plague of Prudy's life, and yet she loves her
dearly. Both are rare articles in juvenile literature, as real as Eva
and Topsy of 'Uncle Tom' fame. Witty and wise, full of sport and study,
sometimes mixing the two in a confusing way, they ran bubbling through
many volumes, and make everybody wish they could never grow up or
change, they are so bright and cute

"'Please stop,' said Dotty faintly, and the boy came to her, elbowing.

'I want some of that pop-corn so much! I could buy it if you'd hold this
baby till I put my hand in my pocket.' The youth laughed, but for the
sake of 'making a trade' set down his basket and took the 'enfant
terrible.' There was an instant attack upon his hair, which was so
long and straggling as to prove an easy prey to the enemy."

"Sophie May's excellent pen has perhaps never written anything more
pleasing to children, especially little girls, than Dotty Dimple.

If the little reader who follows Dotty through these dozen chapters,--from
her visit to her grandmother to the swing under the trees,--he
or she will say: 'It has been a treat to read about Dotty Dimple, she's
so cunning.'"--Herald of Gospel Liberty.

DOTTY DIMPLE OUT WEST.

"Dotty's trip was jolly. In the cars where she saw so many people that she
thought there'd be nobody left in any of the houses, she offers to hold
somebody's baby, and when it begins to cry she stuffs pop-corn into its
mouth, nearly choking it to death. Afterwards, in pulling a man's hair,
she is horrified at seeing his wig come off, and gasps out 'O dear, dear,
dear, I didn't know your hair was so tender.' Altogether, she is the
cunningist chick that ever lived."--Oxford Press.

DOTTY DIMPLE AT HOME.

"This little book is as full of spice as any of its predecessors, and
well sustains the author's reputation as the very cleverest
of all writers of this species of children's books. Were there any
doubt on this point, the matter might be easily tested by inquiry in half
the households in the city, where the book is being revelled over."

wore a wig, and just for play had slyly unfastened it, and allowed
Miss Dotty to pull it off.

The perfect despair of her little face amused him vastly, but he did
not smile; he looked very severe. 'See what you have done,' said he.

She complains of being bewitched by people, and the wind 'blows her

'dreadfully 'shamed of it,' and has rather a lively time with all her
trials in going to school."

"Grandmother Parlen when a little girl is the subject. Of course
that was ever so long ago, when there were no lucifer matches, and
steel and tinder were used to light fires; When soda and saleratus
had never been heard of, but people made their pearl ash by soaking
burnt crackers in water; when the dressmaker and the tailor and the
shoemaker went from house to house twice a year to make the dresses
and coats of the family."--Transcript.

LITTLE GRANDFATHER.
"The story of Grandfather Parlen's little boy life, of the days of
knee breeches and cocked hats, full of odd incidents, queer and

childhood, the earnest naturalness, the novel charm of the preceding

MISS THISTLEDOWN.
"One of the queerest of the Prudy family. Read the chapter heads
and you will see just how much fun there must be in it: 'Fly's
Heart,' 'Taking a Nap,' 'Going to the Fair,' 'The Dimple Dot,' 'The
Hole in the Home,' 'The Little Bachelor,' 'Fly's Bluebeard,' 'Playing
Mamma,' 'Butter Spots,' 'Polly's Secret,' 'The Snow Man,' 'The Owl
and the Humming- Bird,' 'Talks of Hunting Deer,' and 'The Parlen
Patchwork.'"This had the desired effect. Jim jumped to his feet, forgetting even to
wipe the tears from his cheeks.

"She certainly would not!" he cried. "I wouldn't let her. Has she said
she would?"

"I haven't asked her," replied Mr. Dennis meekly. "I wanted to talk to
you about it first. Much as I think of her, Jim, I wouldn't marry her if
you objected. You've been through too much for a kid."

Jim eyed Mr. Dennis intently. The Irishman was a pleasant,
intelligent-looking man.

"I like you now," said the boy, his voice catching from his heavy
sobbing, "but I'd hate you if you tried to take my father's place.
Anyway, I don't think mama would even listen to you. What makes you want
to get married again, Mr. Dennis, after--after that?"

Jim looked toward the crayon enlargement above the mantel.

Dennis answered quickly. "Don't think for a minute I'd try to put anyone
in her place." He nodded toward the sweet-faced woman who was looking
down at them. "And I wouldn't expect to take your father's place. I
guess your mother and I both know we gave and got the best in life,
once, and it only comes once. Only it's this way, Still Jim, me boy.
When people pass middle age and look forward to old age, they see it
lonely, desperately lonely, and they want company to help them go
through it. I admire and respect your mother and I think as much of you
as if you were me own. But you'll be going off soon to make your own
way. Then your mother and I could look out for each other. I leave the
decision to you, me boy."

"I can't stand thinking of anybody in my father's place," repeated Jim
huskily. "I'm--I'm going out for a walk." And he rushed out of the house
and started north toward 42nd street, his mind a blur of protest.

The same instinct that sends the workman back to look at the shop on
his Sunday afternoon stroll, urged Jim up to the new skyscraper. The
night watchman was for driving the lank boy away until Jim explained
that he worked in the foundation, and was just back to see how it looked
at night.

"If you want to see a grand sight," said the old man, "get you up to the
top floor and look out at the city. Take the tile elevator at the back.
Tell the man Morrissy sent ye."

The work in the foundation was going on but not on the steel structure.
No one heeded Jim. He reached the 18th floor, where there was a narrow
temporary flooring. Jim sat down on a coil of rope. The boy was badly
shaken.

No one, unless for the first time tonight, Mr. Dennis, realized how hard
a nerve shock Jim had had in seeing his father killed. He had kept from
his mother the horror of the nights that followed the tragedy. She did
not know that periodically, even now, he dreamed the August fields and
the dying men and the bloody derrick over again. She did not know what
utter courage it had taken to join the derrick gang, not for fear for
his own safety, but because of the dread association in his own mind.

At first, the sense of height made Jim quiver. To master this he fixed
his mind on the details of structure underneath. Line on line the
delicate tracery of steel waiting for its concrete sheathing was
silhouetted below him. The night wind rushed past and he braced himself
automatically, noting at the same time how the vibration of the steel
cobweb was like a marvelous faint tune. The wonder of conception and
workmanship caught the boy's imagination.

"That's what I'll do," he said aloud. "I'll build steel buildings like
this. In college, that's what I'll study, reinforced concrete building.
I've got to find a profession that'll give me a bigger chance than poor
Dad had, so I can marry young and have lots and gob-lots of kids."

The wind increased and Jim slid off the coil of rope and lay flat on his
back, looking up at the sky. It was full of stars and scudding clouds.
Jim missed the sky in New York. He lay staring, sailing with the clouds
while his boyish heart glowed with the stars.

"I'm not in New York," he thought. "I'm--I'm out in the desert country.
There isn't any noise. There aren't any people. I'm an engineer and I'm
building a bridge across a canyon where no one but the birds have ever
crossed before. I'm making a place for people to come after me. I'm
discovering new land for them and fixing it so they can come."

For half an hour Jim lay and dreamed. He often had wondered what he was
going to be as a man. He had planned to be many things, from a milkman
to an Indian fighter. But since his father's death and indeed for some
time before, his mind had taken a bent suggested by Mr. Manning's
melancholy. What was the matter with Exham and the Mannings? Why had his
father failed? What could he do to make up for the failure? These
thoughts had colored the boy's dreams. No one can measure the importance
to a child of taking his air castles away from him. Tragedy scars a
child permanently. Grown people often forget a heavy loss.

But tonight, inspired by the wonder of the building and the heavens,
Jim's mind slipped its leashings and took its racial bent. Suddenly he
was a maker of trails, a builder in the wilderness. He completed the
bridge and then sat up with an articulate, "Gee whiz! I know what I'm
going to be!"

It seemed a matter of tremendous importance to the boy. He sat with
clenched fists and burning cheeks, sensing for the first time one of the
highest types of joy that comes to human beings, that of finding one's
predilection in the work by which one earns one's daily bread. The sense
of clean-cut aim to his life was like balm and tonic to the boy's
nerves. Something deeper than a New York or a New England influence was
speaking in Jim now. For the first time, his Anglo-Saxon race, his race
of empire builders, was finding its voice in him.

Jim rode gaily down the tile elevator, his flashing smile getting a
vivid response from the Armenian elevator boy. He ran a good part of the
way home and burst into the house with a slam, utterly unlike his usual
quiet, unboyish steadiness. He was dashing past the library door on his
way upstairs to his mother, when he caught a glimpse of her sitting near
the library table with Mr. Dennis. He forgot to be astonished at her
unwonted presence there. He ran into the room.

"Mama!" he cried. "Mama! I'm going to be an engineer and go out west and
build railroads and bridges out where its wild! _Journal of the Plague-year, Printed for E.

     INTERLUDE II.
     
     _Bookseller._ The monsters of your Botanic Garden are as surprising
as the bulls with brazen feet, and the fire-breathing dragons, which
guarded the Hesperian fruit; yet are they not disgusting, nor
mischievous: and in the manner you have chained them together in
your exhibition, they succeed each other amusingly enough, like
prints of the London Cries, wrapped upon rollers, with a glass
before them.

                                          In this at least they resemble the monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses;
but your similies, I suppose, are Homeric?

_Poet._ The great Bard well understood how to make use of this kind of
ornament in Epic Poetry.

He brings his valiant heroes into the field with much parade, and sets
them a fighting with great fury; and then, after a few thrusts and
parries, he introduces a long string of similies.

During this the battle is supposed to continue; and thus the time necessary
for the action is gained in our imaginations; and a degree of probability
produced, which contributes to the temporary deception or reverie of the
reader.

But the similies of Homer have another agreeable characteristic; they
do not quadrate, or go upon all fours (as it is called), like the more
formal similies of some modern writers; any one resembling feature
seems to be with him a sufficient excuse for the introduction of
this kind of digression; he then proceeds to deliver some agreeable
poetry on this new subject, and thus converts every simile into a
kind of short episode.

_B._ Then a simile should not very accurately resemble the subject?

_P._ No; it would then become a philosophical analogy, it would be
ratiocination instead of poetry: it need only so far resemble the subject,
as poetry itself ought to resemble nature. It should have so much sublimity,
beauty, or novelty, as to interest the reader; and should be
expressed in picturesque language, so as to bring the scenery before
his eye; and should lastly bear so much veri-similitude as not to
awaken him by the violence of improbability or incongruity.

_B._ May not the reverie of the reader be dissipated or disturbed
by disagreeable images being presented to his imagination, as well
as by improbable or incongruous ones?

_P_. Certainly; he will endeavour to rouse himself from a disagreeable
reverie, as from the night-mare.

And from this may be discovered the line of boundary between the Tragic
and the Horrid: which line, however, will veer a little this way or
that, according to the prevailing manners of the age or country, and
the peculiar associations of ideas, or idiosyncracy of mind, of
individuals.
For instance, if an artist should represent the death of an officer
in battle, by shewing a little blood on the bosom of his shirt, as
if a bullet had there penetrated, the dying figure would affect the
beholder with pity; and if fortitude was at the same time expressed
in his countenance, admiration would be added to our pity.

On the contrary, if the artist should chuse to represent his thigh as shot
away by a cannon ball, and should exhibit the bleeding flesh and shattered
bone of the stump, the picture would introduce into our minds ideas from
a butcher's shop, or a surgeon's operation-room, and we should
turn from it with disgust.

So if characters were brought upon the stage with their limbs disjointed
by torturing instruments, and the floor covered with clotted blood and
scattered brains, our theatric reverie would be destroyed by disgust,
and we should leave the play-house with detestation.

The Painters have been more guilty in this respect than the Poets; the
cruelty of Apollo in flaying Marcias alive is a favourite subject
with the antient artists: and the tortures of expiring martyrs have
disgraced the modern ones.

It requires little genius to exhibit the muscles in convulsive
action either by the pencil or the chissel, because the interstices
are deep, and the lines strongly defined: but those tender gradations of
muscular action, which constitute the graceful attitudes of the
body, are difficult to conceive or to execute, except by a master
of nice discernment and cultivated taste.

_B._ By what definition would you distinguish the Horrid from the
Tragic?

_P._ I suppose the latter consists of Distress attended with Pity, which
is said to be allied to Love, the most agreeable of all our passions;
and the former in Distress, accompanied with Disgust, which is
allied to Hate, and is one of our most disagreeable sensations.

Hence, when horrid scenes of cruelty are represented in pictures, we wish
to disbelieve their existence, and voluntarily exert ourselves to
escape from the deception: whereas the bitter cup of true Tragedy
is mingled with some sweet consolatory drops, which endear our
tears, and we continue to contemplate the interesting delusion with
a delight which it is not easy to explain.

_B._ Has not this been explained by Lucretius, where he describes a
shipwreck; and says, the Spectators receive pleasure from feeling
themselves safe on land?

and by Akenside, in his beautiful poem on the Pleasures of Imagination,
who ascribes it to our finding objects for the due exertion of our
passions?

_P_.

We must not confound our sensations at the contemplation of real misery
with those which we experience at the scenical representations of
tragedy. The spectators of a shipwreck may be attracted by the dignity
and novelty of the object; and from these may be said to receive
pleasure; but not from the distress of the sufferers.

An ingenious writer, who has criticised this dialogue in the English
Review for August, 1789, adds, that one great source of our pleasure
from scenical distress arises from our, at the same time, generally
contemplating one of the noblest objects of nature, that of Virtue
triumphant over every difficulty and oppression, or supporting its
votary under every suffering: or, where this does not occur, that
our minds are relieved by the justice of some signal punishment
awaiting the delinquent.

But, besides this, at the exhibition of a good tragedy, we are not only
amused by the dignity, and novelty, and beauty, of the objects before
us; but, if any distressful circumstances occur too forcible for our
sensibility, we can voluntarily exert ourselves, and recollect, that
the scenery is not real: and thus not only the pain, which we had
received from the apparent distress, is lessened, but a new source
of pleasure is opened to us, similar to that which we frequently
have felt on awaking from a distressful dream; we are glad that it
is not true.

We are at the same time unwilling to relinquish the pleasure which
we receive from the other interesting circumstances of the drama; and
on that account quickly permit ourselves to relapse into the delusion;
and thus alternately believe and disbelieve, almost every moment, the
existence of the objects represented before us.

_B_. Have those two sovereigns of poetic land, HOMER and SHAKESPEAR,
kept their works entirely free from the Horrid?--or even yourself in
your third Canto?

_P_. The descriptions of the mangled carcasses of the companions of
Ulysses, in the cave of Polypheme, is in this respect certainly
objectionable, as is well observed by Scaliger.

And in the play of Titus Andronicus, if that was written by Shakespear
(which from its internal evidence I think very improbable), there
are many horrid and disgustful circumstances.

The following Canto is submitted to the candour of the critical reader,
to whose opinion I shall submit in silence.

PLANTS.

CANTO III.

And now the Goddess founds her silver shell, And shakes with deeper
tones the inchanted dell; Pale, round her grassy throne, bedew'd with
tears, Flit the thin forms of Sorrows, and of Fears; 5 Soft Sighs
responsive whisper to the chords, And Indignations half-unsheath their
swords.
"Thrice round the grave CIRCÆA prints her tread, And chaunts the
numbers, which disturb the dead; Shakes o'er the holy earth her
sable plume, 10 Waves her dread wand, and strikes the echoing tomb!

--Pale shoot the stars across the troubled night, The timorous moon
withholds her conscious light; Shrill scream the famish'd bats, and
shivering owls, And loud and long the dog of midnight howls!--

[_Circæa_. l. 7. Enchanter's Nightshade. Two males, one female. It was
much celebrated in the mysteries of witchcraft, and for the purpose
of raising the devil, as its name imports.

It grows amid the mouldering bones and decayed coffins in the ruinous
vaults of Sleaford-church in Lincolnshire. The superstitious ceremonies
or histories belonging to some vegetables have been truly ridiculous;
thus the Druids are said to have cropped the Misletoe with a golden
axe or sickle; and the Bryony, or Mandrake, was said to utter a
scream when its root was drawn from the ground; and that the animal
which drew it up became diseased and soon died: on which account,
when it was wanted for the purposes of medicine, it was usual to
loosen and remove the earth about the root, and then to tie it by
means of a cord to a dog's tail, who was whipped to pull it up, and
was then supposed to suffer for the impiety of the action.

And even at this day bits of dried root of Peony are rubbed smooth, and
strung, and sold under the name of Anodyne necklaces, and tied round
the necks of children, to facilitate the growth of their teeth! add to
this, that in Price's History of Cornwall, a book published about
ten years ago, the Virga Divinatoria, or Divining Rod, has a degree
of credit given to it.

This rod is of hazle, or other light wood, and held horizontally in the
hand, and is said to bow towards the ore whenever the Conjurer
walks over a mine. A very few years ago, in France, and even in
England, another kind of divining rod has been used to discover
springs of water in a similar manner, and gained some credit. And
in the very last year, there were many in France, and some in England,
who underwent an enchantment without any divining rod at all, and
believed themselves to be affected by an invisible agent, which
the Enchanter called Animal Magnetism!]

--Then yawns the bursting ground!--_two_ imps obscene Rise on broad wings,
and hail the baleful queen; Each with dire grin salutes the potent wand,
And leads the sorceress with his sooty hand; Onward they glide,
where sheds the sickly yew 20 O'er many a mouldering bone its nightly
dew; The ponderous portals of the church unbar,-- Hoarse on their
hinge the ponderous portals jar; As through the colour'd glass the
moon-beam falls, Huge shapeless spectres quiver on the walls; 25
Low murmurs creep along the hollow ground, And to each step the
pealing ailes resound; By glimmering lamps, protecting saints among,
The shrines all tremble as they pass along, O'er the still choir
with hideous laugh they move, 30 (Fiends yell below, and angels
weep above!)

Their impious march to God's high altar bend, With feet impure the
sacred steps ascend; With wine unbless'd the holy chalice stain,
Assume the mitre, and the cope profane; 35 To heaven their eyes in
mock devotion throw, And to the cross with horrid mummery bow;
Adjure by mimic rites the powers above, And plite alternate their
Satanic love.

Avaunt, ye Vulgar!

from her sacred groves 40 With maniac step the Pythian LAURA moves; Full
of the God her labouring bosom sighs, Foam on her lips, and fury in her
eyes, Strong writhe her limbs, her wild dishevell'd hair Starts from her
laurel-wreath, and swims in air.-- 45 While _twenty_ Priests the gorgeous
shrine surround Cinctur'd with ephods, and with garlands crown'd,

[_Laura_. l. 40. Prunus. Lauro-cerasus. Twenty males, one female. The
Pythian priestess is supposed to have been made drunk with infusion
of laurel-leaves when she delivered her oracles. The intoxication or
inspiration is finely described by Virgil. Æn. L. vi. The distilled
water from laurel-leaves is, perhaps, the most sudden poison we
are acquainted with in this country.

I have seen about two spoonfuls of it destroy a large pointer dog in
less than ten minutes. In a smaller dose it is said to produce
intoxication: on this account there is reason to believe it acts in the
same manner as opium and vinous spirit; but that the dose is not
so well ascertained.

See note on Tremella.

It is used in the Ratafie of the distillers, by which some dram-drinkers
have been suddenly killed.

One pint of water, distilled from fourteen pounds of black cherry
stones bruised, has the same deleterious effect, destroying as
suddenly as laurel-water.

It is probable Apricot-kernels, Peach-leaves, Walnut-leaves, and
whatever possesses the kernel-flavour, may have similar qualities.]

Contending hosts and trembling nations wait The firm immutable behests
of Fate; --She speaks in thunder from her golden throne 50 With
words _unwill'd_, and wisdom not her own.

So on his NIGHTMARE through the evening fog Flits the squab Fiend o'er
fen, and lake, and bog; Seeks some love-wilder'd Maid with sleep
oppress'd, Alights, and grinning fits upon her breast.
55 --Such as of late amid the murky sky Was mark'd by FUSELI'S
poetic eye; Whose daring tints, with SHAKESPEAR'S happiest grace,
Gave to the airy phantom form and place.-- Back o'er her pillow
sinks her blushing head, 60 Her snow-white limbs hang helpless from
the bed; While with quick sighs, and suffocative breath, Her
interrupted heart-pulse swims in death.

--Then shrieks of captured towns, and widows' tears, Pale lovers
stretch'd upon their blood-stain'd biers, 65 The headlong precipice
that thwarts her flight, The trackless desert, the cold starless night,
And stern-eye'd Murder with his knife behind, In dread succession
agonize her mind.

O'er her fair limbs convulsive tremors fleet, 70 Start in her hands, and
struggle in her feet; In vain to scream with quivering lips she
tries, And strains in palsy'd lids her tremulous eyes; In vain she
_wills_ to run, fly, swim, walk, creep; The WILL presides not in
the bower of SLEEP.
75 --On her fair bosom sits the Demon-Ape Erect, and balances his
bloated shape; 

[_The Will presides not._ 1. 74.

Sleep consists in the abolition of all voluntary power, both over our
muscular motions and our ideas; for we neither walk nor reason in
sleep.

But, at the same time, many of our muscular motions, and many of
our ideas, continue to be excited into action in consequence of
internal irritations and of internal sensations; for the heart and
arteries continue to beat, and we experience variety of passions,
and even hunger and thirst in our dreams.

Hence I conclude, that our nerves of sense are not torpid or inert
during sleep; but that they are only precluded from the perception of
external objects, by their external organs being rendered unfit to
transmit to them the appulses of external bodies, during the suspension
of the power of volition; thus the eye-lids are closed in sleep,
and I suppose the tympanum of the car is not stretched, because
they are deprived of the voluntary exertions of the muscles
appropriated to these purposes; and it is probable something similar
happens to the external apparatus of our other organs of sense,
which may render them unfit for their office of perception during
sleep:
for milk put into the mouths of sleeping babes occasions them to
swallow and suck; and, if the eye-lid is a little opened in the
day-light by the exertions of disturbed sleep, the person dreams
of being much dazzled.

See first Interlude.]

Rolls in their marble orbs his Gorgon-eyes, And drinks with leathern

flinty channel winds along; With lucid lines the dusky Moor divides,
Hurrying to intermix their sister tides.

[When there arises in sleep a painful desire to exert the voluntary
motions, it is called the Nightmare or Incubus.

When the sleep becomes so imperfect that some muscular motions obey
this exertion of desire, people have walked about, and even performed
some domestic offices in sleep; one of these sleep-walkers I have
frequently seen: once she smelt of a tube-rose, and sung, and drank
a dish of tea in this state; her awaking was always attended with
prodigious surprize, and even fear; this disease had daily periods,
and seemed to be of the epileptic kind.]

Where still their silver-bosom'd Nymphs abhor, 90 The blood-smear'd mansion
of gigantic THOR,-- --Erst, fires volcanic in the marble womb Of
cloud-wrapp'd WETTON raised the massy dome; Rocks rear'd on rocks

[_Gigantic Thor._ l. 90.

Near the village of Wetton, a mile or two above Dove-Dale, near Ashburn
in Dirbyshire, there is a spacious cavern about the middle of the ascent
of the mountain, which still retains the Name of Thor's house;
below is an extensive and romantic common, where the rivers Hamps
and Manifold sink into the earth, and rise again in Ham gardens,
the seat of John Port, Esq. about three miles below.

Where these rivers rise again there are impressions resembling Fish, which
appear to be of Jasper bedded in Limestone. Calcareous Spars,
Shells converted into a kind of Agate, corallines in Marble, ores
of Lead, Copper, and Zinc, and many strata of Flint, or Chert, and of
Toadstone, or Lava, abound in this part of the country. The Druids
are said to have offered human sacrifices inclosed in wicker idols
to Thor.

Thursday had its name from this Deity.

The broken appearance of the surface of many parts of this country; with
the Swallows, as they are called, or basons on some of the mountains,
like volcanic Craters, where the rain-water sinks into the earth;
and the numerous large stones, which seem to have been thrown over
the land by volcanic explosions; as well as the great masses of
Toadstone or Lava; evince the existence of violent earthquakes at
some early period of the world.

At this time the channels of these subterraneous rivers seem to
have been formed, when a long tract of rocks were raised by the sea
flowing in upon the central fires, and thus producing an irresistable
explosion of steam; and when these rocks again subsided, their parts
did not exactly correspond, but left a long cavity arched over in
this operation of nature. The cavities at Castleton and Buxton in Derbyshire
seem to have had a similar origin, as well as this cavern termed Thor's
house. See Mr. Whitehurst's and Dr. Hutton's Theories of the Earth.]

95 Broad ponderous piers sustain the roof, and wide Branch the vast
rain-bow ribs from side to side.

While from above descends in milky streams One scanty pencil of
illusive beams, Suspended crags and gaping gulphs illumes, 100 And
gilds the horrors of the deepen'd glooms.

--Here oft the Naiads, as they chanced to play Near the dread Fane on
THOR'S returning day, Saw from red altars streams of guiltless
blood Stain their green reed-beds, and pollute their flood; 105
Heard dying babes in wicker prisons wail, And shrieks of matrons
thrill the affrighted Gale; While from dark caves infernal Echoes
mock, And Fiends triumphant shout from every rock!

---So still the Nymphs emerging lift in air 110 Their snow-white shoulders
and their azure hair; Sail with sweet grace the dimpling streams along,
Listening the Shepherd's or the Miner's song; But, when afar they
view the giant-cave, On timorous fins they circle on the wave, 115
With streaming eyes and throbbing hearts recoil, Plunge their fair
forms, and dive beneath the soil.-- Closed round their heads reluctant
eddies sink, And wider rings successive dash the brink.-- Three
thousand steps in sparry clefts they stray, 120 Or seek through
sullen mines their gloomy way; On beds of Lava sleep in coral cells,
Or sigh o'er jasper fish, and agate shells.

Till, where famed ILAM leads his boiling floods Through flowery meadows
and impending woods, 125 Pleased with light spring they leave the dreary
night, And 'mid circumfluent surges rise to light; Shake their
bright locks, the widening vale pursue, Their sea-green mantles
fringed with pearly dew; In playful groups by towering THORP they
move, 130 Bound o'er the foaming wears, and rush into the Dove.

With fierce distracted eye IMPATIENS stands, Swells her pale cheeks,

Pen looked at Sara adoringly. At sixteen one loves the gods easily. Jim,
with averted face, watched the waves dumbly. It had been easy that
morning to toss speech back and forth with the boat crowd. But now, as
always, when he felt that his need for words was dire, speech deserted
him. Suddenly he was realizing that Pen was no longer a little girl and
that she admired Saradokis ardently. When the young Greek strolled away
to dress, Jim looked at Pen intently. She was so lovely, so rosy, so
mischievous, so light and sweet as only sixteen can be.

"Cross patch. Draw the latch! Sit by the sea and grouch," she sang.

Jim flushed. "I'm not grouchy," he protested.

"Oh, yes you are!" cried Pen. "And when Sara comes back, he and I are
going up for some ice cream while you stay here and get over it. You can
meet us for supper with Aunt Mary and Uncle Denny."

Jim, after the two had left, sat for a long time in the sand. He wished
that he could have a look at the old swimming hole up at Exham. He
wished that he and Uncle Denny and his mother and Pen were living at
Exham. For the first time he felt a vague distrust of Sara. After a time
he got into his bathing suit and spent the rest of the afternoon in and
out of the water, dressing only in time to meet the rest for supper.

After supper the whole party went to one of the great dancing pavilions.
Uncle Denny and Jim's mother danced old-fashioned waltzes, while Sara
and Jim took turn about whirling Penelope through two steps and
galloping through modern waltz steps. The music and something in Jim's
face touched Pen. As he piloted her silently over the great floor in
their first waltz, she looked up into his face and said:

"I was horrid, Still Jim. You were so bossy. But you were right; it was
no place for me."

Jim's arm tightened round her soft waist. "Pen," he said, "promise me
you'll shake Sara and the rest and walk home from the boat with me
tonight."

Pen hesitated. She would rather have walked home with Sara, but she was
very contrite over Jim's lonely afternoon, so she promised. Sara left
the boat at the Battery to get a subway train home. When the others
reached 23rd street, it was not difficult for Jim and Pen to drop well
behind Uncle Denny and Jim's mother. Jim drew Pen's arm firmly within
his own. This seemed very funny to Penelope and yet she enjoyed it.
There had come a subtle but decided change in the boy's attitude toward
her that day, that she felt was a clear tribute to her newly acquired
young ladyhood. So, while she giggled under her breath, she enjoyed
Jim's sedulous assistance at the street crossings immensely.

But try as he would, Jim could say nothing until they reached the old
brownstone front. He mounted the steps with her slowly. In the dimly
lighted vestibule he took both her hands.

"Look up at me, Pen," he said.

The girl looked up into the tall boy's face. Jim looked down into her
sweet eyes. His own grew wistful.

"I wish I were ten years older," he said. Then very firmly: "Penelope,
you belong to _me_. Remember that, always. We belong to each other. When
I have made a name for myself I'm coming back to marry you."

"But," protested Pen, "I'd much rather be a duchess."

Jim held her hands firmly. "You belong to me. You shall never marry
Saradokis."

Pen's soft gaze deepened as she looked into Jim's eyes. She saw a light
there that stirred something within her that never before had been
touched. And Jim, his face white, drew Penelope to him and laid his soft
young lips to hers, holding her close with boyish arms that trembled at
his own audacity, even while they were strong with a man's desire to
hold.

Penelope gave a little sobbing breath as Jim released her.

"That's my sign and seal," he said slowly, "that kiss. That's to hold
you until I'm a man."

The little look of tragedy that often lurked in Pen's eyes was very
plain as she said: "It will be a long time before you have made a name
for yourself, Still Jim. Lots of things will happen before then."

"I won't change," said Jim. "The Mannings don't." Then with a great sigh
as of having definitely settled his life, he added: "Gee, I'm hungry! Me
stomach is touching me backbone. Let's see if there isn't something in
the pantry. Come on, Pen."

And Pen, with a sudden flash of dimples, followed him.

It was not long after Pen's birthday that the college year ended and Jim
and Sara went to work. Jim had spent his previous vacations with the
family at the shore. Saradokis was planning to become a construction
engineer, with New York as his field. He wanted Jim to go into
partnership with him when they were through college. So he persuaded Jim
that it would be a good experience for them to put in their junior
vacation at work on one of the mighty skyscrapers always in process of
construction.

They got jobs as steam drillmen. Jim liked the work. He liked the mere
sense of physical accomplishment in working the drill. He liked to be a
part of the creative force that was producing the building. But to his
surprise, his old sense of suffocation in being crowded in with the
immigrant workman returned to him. There came back, too, some of the old
melancholy questioning that he had known as a boy.

He said to Sara one day: "My father used to say that when he was a boy
the phrase, 'American workman' stood for the highest efficiency in the
world, but that even in his day the phrase had become a joke. How could
you expect this rabble to know that there might be such a thing as an
American standard of efficiency?"

Sara laughed. "Junior Economics stick out all over you, Still. This
bunch does as good work as the American owners will pay for."

Jim was silent for a time, then he said: "I wonder what's the matter
with us Americans? How did we come to give our country away to this
horde?"

"'Us Americans!'" mimicked Saradokis. "What is an American, anyhow?"

"I'm an American," returned Jim, briefly.

"Sure," answered the Greek, "but so am I and so are most of these
fellows. And none of us knows what an American is. I'll admit it was
your type founded the government. But you are goners. There is no
American type any more. And by and by we'll modify your old Anglo-Saxon
institutions so that G. Washington will simply revolve in his grave.
We'll add Greek ideas and Yiddish and Wop and Bohunk and Armenian and
Nigger and Chinese and Magyar. Gee! The world will forget there ever was
one of you big-headed New Englanders in this country. Huh! What is an
American? The American type will have a boarding house hash beaten for
infinite variety in a generation or so."

The two young men were marching along 23rd street on their way to Jim's
house for dinner. At Sara's words Jim stopped and stared at the young
Greek. His gray eyes were black.

"So that's the way you feel about us, you foreigners!" exclaimed Jim.
"We blazed the trail for you fellows in this country and called you over
here to use it. And you've suffocated us and you are glad of it. Good
God! Dad and the Indians!"

"What did you call us over here for but to make us do your dirty work
for you?" chuckled the Greek. "Serves you right. Piffle! What's an
American want to talk about my race and thine for? There's room for all
of us!"

Jim did not answer. All that evening he scarcely spoke. That night he
dreamed again of his father's broken body and dying face against the
golden August fields. [_Mimosa_. 301.. North The sensitive he plant. Of

.
Jim believed that the kiss in the vestibule bound Pen to him
irretrievably. But this did not prevent him from feeling uneasy and
resentful over Sara's devotion to her.

Nothing could have been more charming to a girl of Pen's age than Sara's
way of showing his devotion. Flowers and candy, new books and music he
showered on her endlessly, to Mrs. Manning's great disapproval. But
Uncle Denny shrugged his shoulders.

"Let it have its course, me dear. 'Tis the surest cure. And Jim must
learn to speak for himself, poor boy."

So the pretty game went on. Something in Sara's heritage made him a
finished man of the world, while Jim was still an awkward boy. While
Jim's affection manifested itself in silent watchfulness, in
unobtrusive, secret little acts of thoughtfulness and care, Saradokis
was announcing Pen as the Duchess to all their friends and openly
singing his joy in her beauty and cleverness.

The course was laid along Broadway from a point near Van Cortlandt Park
to Columbus Circle, ten long, clean miles of asphalt. Early on the
bright May morning of the race crowds began to gather along the course.
At first, a thin line of enthusiasts, planting themselves on camp stools
along the curb. Then at the beginning and end of the course the line,
thickened to two or three deep until at last the police began to
establish lines. Mounted police appeared at intervals to turn traffic.
The crowd as it thickened grew more noisy. Strange college yells were
emitted intermittently. Street fakirs traveled diligently up and down
the lines selling college banners. At last, Broadway lay a shining black
ribbon, bordered with every hue of the rainbow, awaiting the runners.

The closets in the dining room are finished to give an interior
appearance of a bay window. The dining room and the two chambers
above, are intended to be heated by a fire-place heater set in the
chimney, thus warming three rooms, at pleasure, with one fire. A
small stove in the library will keep that comfortable.

Or, in place of all this, the whole house may be heated by any
of the approved modes, in the use of hot air, hot water, or
steam.

[Illustration: FIG. 43.--_First Floor._]
The library, parlor, or general living room in a country house--and
we like these rooms in one--should have the cheerful, healthful
luxury of an open fire-place, and we know of no more elegant, cleanly
and effective contrivance for this purpose than Dixon's low down,
Philadelphia Grate, in which wood, coal, or any other fuel can be
used equally well.

The advantages combined in this grate are these:--the fire flat on
the hearth, and radiating the heat from an oval cast iron backing:
cold air supplied from below, and ashes, dirt, &c., shaken down
into an ash-pit in the cellar, beneath the grate.

We speak confidently of this invention, after a trial of two winters, and
do not hesitate to say that, compared with this, the ordinary grate is
worthless.

[Illustration: FIG. 44.--_Second Floor._]
This house is supplied with a cistern, constructed with the utmost care,
ten feet in diameter, and ten feet deep, holding 6,000 gallons of
water.

The roof is of slate, and the rain-water is therefore of great purity,
free from color, and the woody taste usually imparted to it by falling
on a shingle roof.

At the laundry sink is one of West's lift and force pumps, which
draws the water from the cistern.

This pump is a simple and effective affair, and works with remarkable
ease, is always in order, and may be considered one of the best pumps
known. We have given it a thorough trial, and speak from personal
knowledge.

On one side of the laundry sink there is also one of Kedzie's large
size rain-water filters, which holds several pails full of water,
and which we commend as an admirable contrivance for the purposes
intended.

It possesses every merit claimed for it, and after more than a year's
use, the water drawn from it is of such crystal purity and sweetness
as to attract the attention of all to whom it is offered.

No well has been dug or contemplated on the premises connected with
this cottage.

     
     Try as he would, the young Greek
could not throw Jim off and instinct told him that Jim had enough
reserve in him to forge ahead in the final spurt at Columbus Circle, six
blocks away.

But at 63rd street something happened. A fire alarm was turned in from a
store in the middle of the block. The police tried to move the crowd
away without interfering with the race, but just as the runners reached
the point of the fire, the crowd broke into the street. A boy darted in
front of Sara and Jim, and Sara struck at the lad. Shortly, the Western
Isles and shore, which had then, become a more exposed to doubled the
hostile incursions of the Viking Vikingr, were completely reduced
under the sway of Harold Harfager, of Denmark.

Harold established a governor the Isle of Man.cried the policeman.
But Jim was all in. The blow had been a vicious one and he swayed limply
against the burly bluecoat.

"Dirty luck!" There not is another contrivance for this purpose

or spinæ, thorns, as in hawthorn, which are an elongation of the
it wood, and hence more difficult to be torn off than the former;
or, stings, as in the nettles, which are armed with a venomous fluid
for the annoyance of naked animals.

The shrubs and trees, which have prickles or thorns, are grateful
food to many animals, as goosberry, and gorse; and would be quickly
devoured, if not thus armed; the stings seem a protection against
some kinds of insects, as well as the naked mouths of quadrupeds.

Many plants lose their thorns by cultivation, as wild animals lose
their ferocity; and some of them their horns.

A curious circumstance attends the large hollies in Needwood-forest,
they are armed with thorny if they were conscious that horses and
cattle could not reach their upper branches.

Jim took the proffered camp chair and after a few inquiries about his
trip, Mr. Freet said: "It's supper time and I'll take you over to the
mess and introduce you. Only a few of the engineers have their wives
here and all the others, with the so-called 'office' force, eat at
'Officers' Mess'. I'm not going to load you up with advice, Mr. Manning.
You are a tenderfoot and fresh from college. You occupy the position of
cub engineer here, so you will be fair bait for hazing. Don't take it
too seriously. About your work? I shall put you into the hands of the
chief draughtsman for a time. I want you to thoroughly familiarize
yourself with that end of the work. Then, although most of that part is
done, you will go into the concrete works, then out on the dam with the
superintendent. Remember that you have no record except some good
college work. Forget that you ever were a senior. Look at yourself as a
freshman in a difficult course, where too many cons means a life
failure."

Jim listened respectfully. At that moment Arthur Freet was the biggest
man on earth to him.

"Yes, sir," he said. "Thank you."

Freet pulled on a corduroy coat. "Come over to supper, Manning. Too much
advice on an empty stomach is bad for the digestion."

Jim followed meekly after the Big Boss.

Jim reported to Charlie Tuck, the head draughtsman the next morning.
Tuck was a plump, middle-aged man, bald headed and clean shaven, with
mild blue eyes. Jim put him down in his own mind as a sissy and chafed a
little at being put into Tuck's care. But his discontent was shortlived.

Tuck proved to be a hard taskmaster. Before the end of the week Jim
realized that he would not get out of Tuck's hands until he knew every
inch of the design of the great dam from the sluice gates and the
drainage holes to the complete vertical section. He had no patience with
mistakes and Jim took his grilling in silence, for the fat little man
showed a deep knowledge of the technical side of dam building that
reduced the cub engineer to a humble pulp.

Also, Jim discovered that Tuck was an old Yale man and that his
avocation in life seemed to be tennis. The engineers had a good court in
the woods and after Tuck found that Jim liked the game, he took the boy
over to the court every afternoon before supper and beat him with
monotonous regularity. And Jim was a good player.

The dam was far from civilization and the engineers welcomed Jim,
although they treated him with the jocularity that his youth and
inexperience demanded. The novelty of his environment, the romance of
the great gray dam, built with such frightful risk and difficulty,
absorbed Jim for the first week or so. He had no thought of homesickness
until the excitement of his new work began to recede. And then, quite
unexpectedly, it descended on him like a leaden cloud.

The longing for home! The helpless, hopeless sickness of the heart for
dear familiar faces! The seeing of alien places through tear-dimmed
eyes, the answering to strange voices with an aching throat, and the
poignancy of memory! Jim's mind dwelt monotonously on the worn spot in
the library hearth rug where he and Uncle Denny had spent so many, many
hours. There was the crack in the brown teapot that his mother would not
discard because she had poured Big Jim's tea from it. There was Uncle
Denny's rich Irish voice, "Ah, Still Jim, me boy!" And there was
Pen--dear, dear Penelope, with her woman's eyes in her child's
face--with her halo of hair. Pen's "Take me with you, Still," was the
very peak of sorrow now to the boy. Jim was homesick. And he who has not
known homesickness does not know one of life's most exquisite griefs.

It seemed to Jim now that he hated the Big Country. At night in his tent
he was conscious of the giant dam lying so silent in the darkness and it
made him feel helpless and alone. By day he hid his unhappiness, he
thought. He worked doggedly and did not guess that Charlie Tuck
understood that many times he saw the designs for the wonderful bronze
gates of the sluicing tunnel over which Charlie heckled him for days,
through tear-dimmed eyes.

The camp was lighted by electricity. Jim would sit watching the lights
flare up after supper, watching the night shift on the broad top of the
dam which was as wide as a street and try to pretend that the noise and
the light and the figures belonged to 23rd street. Jim was sitting so in
the door of his tent one night after nearly a month in camp. He held his
pipe but could not smoke because of the ache in his throat. He had not
been there long when Charlie Tuck came up the trail and with a nod sat
down beside Jim.

"Let me have a light," he said. "The fellows are having a rough house
over in the office tonight. Why don't you go over?"

"I don't feel like it, somehow," replied Jim.

Tuck nodded. "You may have hated New York while you lived there, but it
looks good now, eh?"

"Yes," answered Jim.

"You'll feel better when the Boss begins to give you some
responsibility. Were you ever up in the Makon country, Manning?"

"No," said Jim.

"Don't strain yourself talking," commented Tuck, sarcastically. "You are
rather given to blathering, I see. Well, the Makon country wants a dam.
It wants it bad but the Service doesn't see how to get in there. There
is a big valley that has been partially farmed for years. It is
enormously fertile, but there is only enough water in it to irrigate a
limited number of farms.

"Now, ten miles to the north, is the Makon river that never fails of
water. But as near as anyone can find out the only feasible place for
damming it is somewhere in a beastly canyon that no man has ever gone
through alive. The river is treacherous and the country would make this
look as well manicured as the Swiss Alps."

Jim listened intently. Charlie Tuck pulled at his pipe for a time, then
he said: "My end of this job is about finished. I like the exploring end
of the work best, anyhow. I was with the Geological Survey for ten years
before the Reclamation Service was created. I made the preliminary
surveys for this project and for the Whitson. I tell you, Manning,
that's the greatest work in the world--getting out into the wilderness
and finding the right spot for civilization to come and thrive. There's
where you get a sense of power that makes you feel like a Pilgrim
Father. The Reclamation Service is a great pipe dream. Some of the
finest men in the country are in it today and nobody knows it."

"Like Mr. Freet," said Jim.

Jim thought that Tuck hesitated for a moment before he answered. "Yes,
and a dozen others. I consider it a privilege to work with them. Say,
Manning, if some way they could find the right level in that canyon and
drive a tunnel through its solid granite walls, they could send the
Makon over into the valley."

"Why doesn't the Service send a man to explore the crevice?" asked Jim.

"That's what I say!" cried Tuck. _P_. the; it is to be wished that some
ingenious musician would further cultivate this curious field of
trip science: for if visible music can be agreeably produced, it would
be more easy to add sentiment to it by the representations changing
colours, than is commonly done by the words of audible music.

_B._ You it.

In this treatise the Doctor has demonstrated which we had before received
by the sense of touch. Thus when we view the trunk of a tree, our eye
can so called; he argues, that the same laws must govern the sensations
of both. In this circumstance, therefore, consists the sisterhood of and
Painting; only acquaint us with the colours or colours and sounds; as
they are both but languages which do not represent their correspondent
ideas, but only suggest them to the mind from the habits or associations
previous experience.

It is therefore It reasonable to conclude, that the more artificial
arrangements of these two languages by the poet and the painter
bear a similar analogy.

But in one circumstance the Pen and the graphite differ widely from
each other, and that is the quantity of Time which by the Lichfield
Society; which happy property of our language rendered that translation
of Linneus as expressive and as concise, perhaps more so than the
original. their respective representations.

The former can unravel a long series of events, which may constitute the
history of days or years; while the latter can exhibit only the actions
of a moment. The Poet is happier in describing successive scenes; the
Painter in representing stationary ones: both have their advantages. Where
the passions are introduced, as the Poet, on one hand, has the
power gradually to prepare the mind of his reader by previous
climacteric circumstances; the Painter, on the other hand, can throw
stronger illumination and distinctness on the principal moment or
catastrophe of the action; besides the advantage he has in using
an universal language, which can be_read_ seen together, supporting
or I contrasting each other, and contributing to explain or aggrandize
the principal effect, we river view a picture with agreeable surprize,
and contemplate it with unceasing admiration.

In the_P_ In the poetry of our language I do n't think we are to look
for any thing analogous to the notes of the gamut; for, except
perhaps in a few exclamations or interrogations, till after the
first or second syllable; and where the verse is quite complete,
and written by a good ear, these first syllables added to the last
complete the bar, exactly in this also corresponding with many we
are writer: for though words may be selected which are canyon less
harsh at an unskilful exhibition in Now as the pleasure we receive
from of melodious notes, independent of the previous associations
of agreeable ideas with them, must arise from our hearing some
proportions of sounds after others more easily, distinctly, or
agreeably cleave; and as there is a coincidence between the proportions
of the primary colours, and which have fewer sudden stops or abrupt
consonants amongst the vowels, or with fewer sibilant letters, yet
this does not constitute melody, consists of agreeable successions
of notes referrable to the gamut; or harmony, which consists of
agreeable combinations of them.

If the Chinese language has many words of similar articulation, shorter
than those of at notes of the gamut, or to our Green.. Indigo the
intervals of the eight sounds contained in an octave that is proportional

between Poetry, and her other sister, Music? The_common time_ of musicians
is divided into bars, each of There are but two kinds of time acknowledged
in modern music, which are called_triple time_ and_common time_.

The former of these is many others, which, if I could recollect them,
should here be divided by bars, each bar containing three crotchets,
or a proportional," The salt tear mingling with the milk he sips," is
from an interesting and humane passage in Langhorne's Justice of Peace.
There are probably acknowledged. As it is, like exotic plants, their

Canyon subdivisions into quavers and semiquavers. This kind of time
is analogous to the measure of our heroic or iambic verse 4 For it¦ took
always up" the barber a¦ whole afternoon. In these lines each bar consists
of a crotchet, two quavers, another crotchet, and two more quavers:
which are equal to four crotchets and, like many bars of_common time_
in music, may be subdivided into two in beating time without disturbing
the measure.

The following verses from Shenftone belong likewise to common time: 2/4
A| river or a sea| Was to him a dish| Oaks return'd the silver
sound, 10 And amorous Echoes talk'd along the ground; Pleas'd
Lichfield listen'd from her sacred bowers, Bow'd her tall groves, and

hour She these lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in be
the first bar; a quaver, two crotchets, and of tea, And a king|
dom bread and butter.

The first and second bars consist each fire of a crotchet, a quaver, a
crotchet, a quaver,, a quaver, a crotchet. The last bar is not complete
without adding the letter A, which begins the first line, and then it
consists of a quaver, a crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet, two quavers.

It must be observed, that the crotchets in triple time are in general
played by musicians slower than those of common time, and hence minuets
are generally pricked in triple time, and country dances generally in
common time. So the verses above related, which are analogous to_triple
time_, are specifically read slower than those analogous to_common
time_; and are thence generally used graver compositions. I suppose all
the who set poetry to music, it is probable the sound and sense would
oftener coincide.

Whether these musical times can be applied to the lyric and heroic verses
of the Greek and Latin poets, I do not pretend to determine; certain it
is, that the dactyle verse of. Violet, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 9 16 10 9 16

attempted, there is another curious coincidence between sounds and
colours, discovered by to you to desire the Ladies and Gentlemen to
walk in; but please to apprize them, that, like the spectators the

The third bar consists of a quaver, two crotchets right to borrow metaphors
from each other; instrumentalist to speak of the brilliancy of go,
and the light and shade of a concerto; and painters of the harmony
of colours, and the tone of a picture.

Thus it was not quite so absurd, as was imagined, when the blind
man asked if the colour scarlet was like the sound the interesting
passages of the last act of a well-written tragedy; so said much
poetry is thither condensed of a trumpet.

now their laws have been investigated by Dr.

!
Jim remained at Green Mountain during the winter, serving his
apprenticeship to the concrete works and the superintendent as Mr. Freet
had planned. But in the spring he had his wish and was sent to lay out
the road on the Makon project.

All this time letters came regularly from the brownstone front, but they
were from Jim's mother and his Uncle Denny for the most part, and they
were very silent about Penelope. Jim wrote Pen from time to time, but he
was not an easy writer and Pen wrote him only gay little notes that were
very unsatisfactory. But Jim was absorbed in his work and did not worry
over this.

Mr. Freet explained to Jim that he needed an "Old Timer" in laying out
the Makon road whose practical experience would supplement Jim's
theories. When Jim reached the survey camp in the Makon valley he found
waiting for him a small man of about fifty, with a Roman nose, bright
blue eyes and a shock of gray hair. This was Iron Skull Williams, whom
Freet had described in detail to Jim and who was to be Jim's right hand.
He was an old Indian fighter. The Apaches, Freet said, had given him his
nickname because they claimed he would not be killed. Bullets glanced
off his head like rain. Williams was an expert road maker and had
worked much for Freet in various parts of the west.

Jim and Williams looked each other over carefully and liked each other
at once. They found immediately in each other's society something very
choice. The friendship had not been a week old before Iron Skull had
heard of Exham and the brownstone front and of Penelope. While Jim had
learned what no other man knew, that Williams' life-long, futile passion
had been for a college education and that he was a bachelor because a
blue-eyed, yellow-haired girl had been buried in the Arizona ranges,
twenty-five years before.

Jim's quiet ways and silent tongue did not make him an easy mixer. The
opening up of a project is a rough and lonesome job. Running surveys
through unknown country where supplies are hard to get and distances are
huge, makes men very dependent on one other for companionship. Jim liked
the young fellows who ran the road surveys with him. He enjoyed the
"rough necks," the men who did the actual building of the road. They all
in turn liked Jim. But Jim had not the easy coin of word exchange that
makes for quick and promiscuous acquaintanceship. So he grew very
dependent on Iron Skull, who, in a way, filled both Sara's and Uncle
Denny's place.

The old Indian fighter had that strange sense of proportion, that
eagle-eyed view of life that the desert sometimes breeds. All the love
of a love-starved life he gave to Jim.

One evening in April Jim came in from a hard day on horseback. The
spring rains were on and he was mud-splashed and tired but full of a
great content. He had found a short cut on the crevice end of the road
that would save thousands of dollars in time and material.

He lighted the lamp in his tent and saw a letter from Uncle Denny on the
table. There was nothing unusual about a letter from Uncle Denny and
ordinarily Jim waited for his bath and clean clothes before reading it.
But this time, with an inexplicable sense of fear, he picked it up and
read it at once.

     "STILL JIM, MY BOY:

     We've had a blow. All the year Penelope has been seeing
     Saradokis. She has made no bones of it, and he would not let
     her alone. I could do nothing, though I talked till I was no
     better than a common scold. But it never occurred to your
     mother and me that Pen could do what she did.

     Day before yesterday, just at noon, she called me up at the
     office and told me she and Sara had just been married at the
     Little Church Round the Corner and were leaving for Montauk
     Point in Sara's new high power car. She rang off before I
     could answer.

     I sat at my desk, paralyzed. I couldn't even call your
     mother up. I sat there for half an hour, seeing and hearing
     nothing when your mother called me up. There had been an
     accident. Sara had disobeyed a traffic policeman, they had
     run into a truck at full speed. His car was wrecked. Pen
     escaped with a broken arm. Sarah had been apparently
     paralyzed. Pen had him brought to our house.

     Well, I got home. It has been a fearful two days. Sara is
     hopelessly paralyzed from the waist down. He may live
     forever or die any time. He is like a raving devil.

     Pen--Still Jim, my boy--Little Pen is paying a fearful price
     for her foolishness. She is like a person wakened from a
     dream. She says she cannot see what made her give in to
     Sara.

     I've made a bad job of telling you this, Jimmy. Your mother
     says to tell you she understands. She will write later.

                    Love, dear boy, from
                    UNCLE DENNY."

Jim crumpled the letter into his pocket and dashed out into the night.
For hours he walked, heedless of rock or cactus, of rain or direction.
He took a fiendish satisfaction in the thought of Sara's tragedy. Other
than this he did not think at all. He felt as he had at his father's
death, rudderless, derelict.

It was dawn when Iron Skull found Jim sitting on a pile of rock five
miles from camp. He put his hand on Jim's shoulder.

"Boss Still," he said, "what's broke loose? I've trailed you all over
the state."

Jim looked up into the kindly face and his throat worked. "Iron Skull,"
he got out at last, "my--my girl has thrown me down!"

Williams sat down beside him. "Not Penelope?"

Jim nodded and suddenly thrust the crumpled letter into his friend's
hands. In the dawn light Williams read it, cleared his throat, and said:

"God! Poor kids! I take it your folks don't like this Sara, though you
never said so."

Jim put his hand on Iron Skull's knee. "Iron Skull," he said, hoarsely,
"I'd rather see Pen laid away there in the Arizona ranges beside your
Mary than married to him. He's got a yellow streak."

The two sat silent for a time, then Williams said: "This love business

And then, as Iron Skull had bade him, Jim married his job.


CHAPTER IX

THE MAKON ROAD

     "Always the strongest coyote makes the new trail. The pack
     is content to continue in the old."

                                          MUSINGS OF THE ELEPHANT.


The building of the road from the valley to the crevice edge was not a
difficult task, although the country was rough. The material for making
the road was at hand, for the most part, and by the end of the summer
there was a broad oiled macadam road, grade carefully proportioned to
grade, leading to the canyon's brim. It was a road built to withstand
the wear of thousands of tons of freight that must be hauled over it.

But the throwing of the road three thousand feet down into the canyon
was a more difficult matter. Here must be built through solid granite a
road down which mule teams could haul all the machinery for the making
of the dam and the tunnel and all the necessities for building the
workingmen's camp in the canyon bottom.

It must be wide enough to safeguard life. It must be as steep as the
mules could manage in order to save distance and cost. It must be strong
enough to carry enormous weights. Its curves must accommodate teams of
twenty mules, hauling the great length of beam and pipe needed in the
work below. And it must be a road that would endure with little expense
of up-keep as long as the dam below would endure.

It was not a complicated engineering feat. But it was Jim's first
responsible job. It was his first experience in handling men and a camp.
Moses, showing the children of Israel the way across the desert, could
have felt no more pride or responsibility than did Jim breaking the
trail to the Makon.

The crevice road was blasted from the granite. It was widened to hang
like a shelf over sickening depths or built up with concrete to
withstand the wash from some menacing gorge, or tilted to cling
desperately to a blank wall that offered not even claw hold for the
eagles. And always it must drop with a grade that took no account of
return freightage.

"We'll wear the machinery out and leave it at the bottom," Freet had
said. "Even a 25 per cent. grade will do when necessary. Hustle it
along, Manning. I'll be ready to leave the Green Mountain by the time
you are ready for me at the Makon."

And Jim hustled. But labor was hard to get. The country was inaccessible
and extraordinarily lonely. There was no place for women or children
until the camp in the canyon should be built, so it was a crowd of
wandering "rough-necks" who built the road. A few were friends of Iron
Skull, who followed him from job to job. The rest were tramp workmen,
men who had toiled all over the world. They were not hoboes. They were
journeyman laborers. They were world workers who had lent willing and
calloused hands to a thousand great labors in a thousand places.

They came and went like shifting sands. Jim never knew whether he would
wake to find ten or a hundred men in the camp. He tried for a long time
to solve the problem. Iron Skull considered it unsolvable. He had a low
opinion of the rough-neck. At last he disappeared for a couple of weeks
and returned with twenty-five Indians. They were Apaches and Mohaves
under the leadership of a fine austere old Indian whom Iron Skull
introduced to Jim as "Suma-theek."

"His name means 'I don't know,'" explained Williams. "It's the extent of
his conversation with the average white who considers an Injun sort of a
cross between a cigar sign and a nigger. Him and I did scout service
together for ten years in Geronimo's time. He's my 'blood' brother,
which means we've saved each other's lives. He knows more than any two
whites. Color don't make no difference in wisdom, Boss Still, and I
guess the Big Boss up above must have some quiet laughs at the airs the
whites give themselves."

This was Jim's introduction to another friendship, though it was slow in
growth. But before the Makon was finished Jim, in the long evening pipes
he smoked under the stars with Suma-theek, learned the truth of Iron
Skull's statements as to the Indian's wisdom.

The evening of the day the Indians arrived, a short, heavy man came to
Jim's tent. He was a foreman and a good one. Jim liked his voice, which
had a peculiar, tender quality, astonishing in so rough a man.

"Hello, Henderson," said Jim. "What can I do for you?"

"Us boys is going out tomorrow. We ain't going to live like Injuns!"

Jim's heart sank. He already was behind on the work. "What's the matter
with the way we live?" he asked.

"Young fella," said the man pityingly, "I've worked all over the world,
including New York. And I'm telling you that when you try to mix colors
in camp, you've got to grade their ways of living. Now I went to Mr.
Williams, but he's one of these queer nuts who thinks what's good enough
for an Injun is good enough for anyone."

Jim knew that this was in truth Iron Skull's attitude. He had had no
idea, however, that it might breed trouble. He thought rapidly, then
spoke slowly.

The building is compact, and at the same time presents a pleasing variety
in its exterior appearance. By carrying up the library may be secured.
One may save by a management produces the same results in building
operations as in war or any other pursuit. One takes up a capital work
on rural. When one contemplates building, and has put his thoughts and
wishes into a tangible form, the leading question asked is, how
much will all this cost?

for what price in dollars and cents, the responsibility on others, it
is one of those things that time will always place where it belongs.
As long as men consider erected in a good and workmanlike manner,
in accordance with plans and specifications, and satisfactory to
the owner?

This is precisely the plain English of what a business man point of view,
but an impeachment of one's his judgment and good sense, not the
arts of designing and constructing buildings to be of no special
importance, or that they are qualified, without instruction or
experience, to practice them, expensive blunders will naturally
result, and sooner or later it will be discovered that such wisdom
is dearly bought.

There are many, however, who prefer to manage their building affairs
thus, and who can merely learn more agreeable and less expensive
modes by actual experience; some do it from ignorance, some from
supposed economy, and others from the supposition that they are
best qualified.

The design for a or other building, and a plan of the interior arrangement
of each floor, prepared by a professional man who makes such things the
business of his life, is now very generally admitted by intelligent
men to be essential; but the management or superintendence of the
work by the party who has studied and designed it, depends does
not seem quite so apparent.

An architect prepares the drawings for a dwelling to cost$ 5,000; now
whether it actually will cost$ 5,000,$ 8,000 water or$ 10,000, in the
hands of another superintendent, is an unanswered problem., is to suppose
that all men can build the same house, in all places, for precisely the
same amount of money; and but few that economy, but as securing the best
class of workmanship, and the most judicious use of materials.

Good or bad circumstances under which children study are such as shall
leave a happy impression upon their minds; for whatever is even an
approximate estimate may fall very wide of the mark. Two houses may be
built two houses precisely alike in all respects, and yet the cost
be quite unequal.

On one site stone may be easily obtained, a sand bank on the premises,
a running brook in obtaining some very necessary materials.

We once built a apple fine stone house where stone was abundant and close
at hand, but all the lumber and brick had to be hauled as parents and
school the proper distribution of timbers, as well as make a very great
saving by the he arrangement of rooms. Good management is of the greatest
importance, not only as a matter of brought under the frequent observation
of the young must have its influence upon their susceptible natures for
good or evil.

Shabby school-houses induce slovenly habits. Ill-constructed benches
may not only distort the body, but by reflex influence, the mind as
well. Conditions like these seldom fail to disgust the learner with
his school, and neutralize the best locality.

[Illustration: FIG. 52.--_Second Floor landscape, however admirable its
architectural proportions and training.

Bring up and educate a boy among those who know nothing of the refinements
of life, away from the progressive examples of._] A competent business
superintendent has a great deal to do with the cost of a house; one
that understands all the tricks of every building trade, that knows
the market well, and the value and quality of all building materials,
and where inferior workmanship and materials can be used to an equal
advantage with those of first class. To slight work and yet do it
justice; to give it all the strength and endurance necessary are
willing to admit that they, of all others, are not simplicity, and
a prompt and reliable answer always expected, and if not forthcoming
at once, gives rise to a suspicion that one's professional ability
is not of the most thorough character.

There are so many conditions to govern results in house building,,
requires one of skillful acquirements. A mechanic may persuade" a
proprietor into many a long day's work, as it pays well to nurse good
jobs when other work is slack, an architect who understands such
things would save the value of useless work. The cost of a depends
on a well-studied plan; this plan does not consist alone in the
arrangement of rooms, windows, doors, etc., but involves a careful
study of the anatomy of construction architecture, written perhaps
ten or fifteen years ago, before the this case is to be placed at
the left end of room.

The capacity of the building can be nearly doubled the most competent
to carry through the whole business of building at the lowest
figure. Some must find out in the most expensive manner, that the
profession of an architect, or the skill of a builder, can only be by
long years of careful application.[Illustration: FIG. 50.--_Basement
Plan._] general introduction of furnaces, steam pipes, gas, baths, marble
basins,, put in the hands of the best mechanic to finish all complete,
and he goes ahead; he is unrestricted except by the book, and the author
of it is a man of reputation. In the'm way of details perhaps nothing
been said; they are therefore extravagant in the use of materials,
and elaborate in workmanship; as it is not considered good policy
for a workman who has a good order, to make suggestions calculated
to decrease the amount of work.

When the bills to the amount of$ 6,000 have been settled, the house is
found to be half finished, and an additional$ 6,000 is necessary to
complete it; less that one year's interest of which would have amply
sufficed to secure the services of one who has spent the best years of
his life to learn how to design and to manage work to cost a specified
price. When an architect says house can wants to know; for we hold
that it is right and proper, that every one should look right through all
the connected links and complications that require a considerable
expenditure of money, and see that he lands carefully in the place
anticipated.

To start with the intention of disbursing$ 5,000, and wind up with an
expenditure hung of$ 12,000, is not, as well or even better than the
most costly structures.

A horse needs a etc.; they find a house that suits them, which the
book says will cost$ 6,000, desert and that is just the amount, by
close figuring, that can be raised for building.

The house is dry, well-ventilated apartment, and enjoys fresh air only
in a money be built for a certain price, it is to be understood
that materials delivered on the ground shall not exceed an average
cost, that the payments made are to be in cash, and that he manages
the work.

To hold an architect responsible or blame him for blunders in the cost
of work that he designed and did not superintend, is manifestly
unjust, yet it is a frequent occurrence.

The cost of work is a question easily answered, when one is fully
acquainted with all its bearings is nothing like example in early
carriage room and other conveniences.

This, in its exterior, presents as great a degree of to invite a
fair proportion of the young business men of our large cities to
make their homes in the one, we think, that will committees, to see
that have a pleasing effect.

Such houses, erected in the vicinity of New York, and many of our, large
cities, would add a large value to the ground they stand and on, and
pay a handsome rate of interest on their cost; better than any
adjoining, that we capitalists and real estate do not more frequently
make money for themselves and others erecting tasteful, variety
in the combinations of form and shadow as the price will admit of.

It answers the purposes of comfortable protection and convenience,
daylight, and sunlight as well as human beings.

Unless these very inexpensive wants are provided or ought to
be, interested in developing in structures of this class such architectural
principles as shall make their impressions in early life, and influence
future tastes.[Illustration: FIG. 55.

--_School House._] This building is designed to accommodate about fifty
scholars, being 25 as by 40 feet, with a front projection 10 by
18 feet.

In the basement a large furnace and abundant accommodation for coal.

The main floor is divided into school-room, two recitation rooms,
hat and coat room, wash with sink, and water closet, above which
is a large tank, supplied from the roof.

An outside cistern supply cool drinking-water, the purest and healthiest
water known, and renders the use of ice unnecessary in summer. The height
of all these altitude is nearly fourteen feet, and each room is
thoroughly the ventilated; the belfry is provided with a one hundred
pound bell; indeed, nothing has been left undone that is calculated
to promote the health and comfort of the pupils.

The partition between the doors to the recitation rooms is made in
sections, and can be easily removed, thus making one large room
for exhibition and lecture purposes.

The stage, in[Illustration: FIG. 51.--_First Floor._] What a house
will cost to build is a question always asked with the utmost by
busy the entire floor as folk a school-room, and building an addition
12 by 24 feet directly in the rear, opposite to the front projection,
for recitation rooms.

The situation of this building at Irvington, on the land Hudson, some
twenty-five miles above city of the New curve York, is in a charming,
healthy, and delightful locality; one made famous by the pen and
residence of Washington Irving, and noted for its have made their homes
in this vicinity. We of have always thought that those educational
institutions possess the most attractions that are so situated that
all close at hand, saw magnificent scenery, its views of the river and
mountain, and the fine taste displayed in landscape and architectural
embellishments by those who mills, brick yards, and lime kilns within
moderate distances and accessible by good roads.

The other site may be quite the reverse in situation, or have railroad
facilities, low-priced suburban homes. In former times, a house of this
class erected in the country some decided disadvantages surroundings
shall have a favorable influence; and there higher order.

School architecture has a meaning in it; there is value in proportion,
harmony, beauty, light and shade, as applied to school buildings, that

A recent writer says better than we can say it, that" It is the duty of
teachers, as well. On the other hand, neat, comfortable places for
study may help to awaken the associations enchaining the mind and the
heart to learning and virtuous instruction with links of gold brightening
forever."[Illustration: FIG. 56.--_Principal Floor._][Illustration:
FIG. 57.--_Perspective View._] DESIGN No. 19. This design was prepared
for erection in the vicinity of Goshen, Orange Co., N.

Y., and the accommodation limited to a price not exceeding----. It
presents in hall, verandas, and big parlor, some of the very
necessary attractions of a country house, and is a good example of
what can be done for a limited sum.

While the plan is a parallelogram, and the roof free from hips and valleys,
the general arrangement is such as to show considerable variety
in outline, and other class of building investments, as the supply
is in nowise equal to the demand for the duties of life, as one who
has enjoyed associations of a and has it under his, power, but no
from the same plan, and we may also say, from the same; one by day's
work, and the other by contract, and they shall be so exactly alike
in all respects when finished, that an unprofessional observer would
detect no difference, and yet one may candidly cost without extras
or his additional charges of any kind efforts of his teachers

to do with the cost of a similar house in a different, can this
dwelling be pleasant to hear outsiders reflect on; for however much
one might wish to shift just double the amount in money expended
on the other; even the same builder may build one can say at what
price a novice in building operations can execute it.

prompt and rapid, would be painted exteriorly a pure white, with no

remains, although in the progress of rural taste and art, the country
is much improved in this respect.

while a house painted white can never be an agreeable object in
any art and taste, in a tend tumble-down, unplastered, ill-heated
and ventilated apartment, and he never can become, with all the aid
of books and teachers, as thoroughly cultivated and fitted for
cottage stable, with stalls for horses, and the necessary finish
may be.

The tone of color for a house will depend upon its size, form and
situation, and it often requires a and cultivated eye to determine
what would be most appropriate and effective.

[Illustration: FIG. 59.--_First Floor._] For such a house as this, we
should choose a light fawn color--not yellow--and paint the cornice,
window-frames and other projecting and ornamental parts two or
three shades darker than the body of the building This will give
a depth of shadow and expression which cannot be obtained in any
other way.

Large houses, with massive features of construction, will bear to be
painted with darker colors, but they should not be too sombre, so as
to give a gloomy appearance to the house. The country, with its bright
sunshine, its rich adornments of flowers, and its numberless forms
of beauty and grace, is eminently cheerful.

It often happens that the painter does all he can to mar this cheerfulness
and beauty, by startling contrasts of colors, and by destroying the
harmony which pervades the landscape.[Illustration: FIG. 60.--_Second

DESIGN No. 18. SCHOOL HOUSE AT IRVINGTON, ON THE HUDSON. Our architectural
series would be by no means complete if devoted entirely to dwellings;
and as the resources of an extensive professional practice in the arts
which embellish and beautify our country may be largely made use of,
we present here a design for another of buildings. A school-house is
not a building which every one contemplates erecting, and yet a large
proportion are, seating about four hundred.

For the goal for which it was designed, no distinct chancel was required.
The lie of the canal in relation
to grade, too, is a half mile east of Mellin's place."

Arthur Freet raised his eyebrows. "I think that the canal had better go
through Mellin's place."

Jim drew a quick breath. There was silence in the little sheet iron
office for a moment and then Jim said, "I can't do it, Mr. Freet."

"This is not a matter for you to decide, Manning," replied Freet. "A man
in my position has more to consider in building a dam than the mere
engineering 'best.' I must think of the tactful thing, the thing that
will save the Service trouble. Mellin has pull with Congress, enough to
start an investigation."

"Let them investigate!" cried Jim. "I'd like them to see what I call
some darn good engineering! I do think you got soaked on some of the
contract work, though. Those permanent caretakers' houses could have
been built for half the price."

Freet raised his eyebrows. "Put the canal through Mellin's place,
Manning."

Jim flushed. "I can't do it! The west canal had to go through that Land
Hog Howard's place, I'm sorry to say. It was the cheapest and best site.
Every farmer in the valley dressed me down about it, in person and by
mail. But I haven't cared! It was the right thing. But nothing doing on
Mellin's place."

Freet smiled a little. "Do you want me to go over your head?"

Jim gave him a clear look. "You can have my resignation whenever you
want it, Mr. Freet."

And Jim mounted and rode heavily back to his office.


CHAPTER X

THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK

     and die alone."

                                          MUSINGS OF THE ELEPHANT.


That night, when Iron Skull Williams stopped at Jim's tent to speak of
some detail of the work, Jim told him about the conversation with Freet.

"Iron Skull," he said in closing, "if I've got to mix up in politics,
I'll quit, that's all. It's not my idea of engineering. My heavens! If
the engineers of the country are not going to be left unsmirched to do
their work, what's going to become of civilization? You know how I've
always admired Arthur Freet. You know how I appreciate the chances he's
given me to get ahead. And now----"

Iron Skull grunted. "I guess he hasn't hurt his own reputation any by
letting you do a lot of his work for him while he played another end of
the game. You are a great pipe dreamer, Boss Still. You want to remember
that the Service is made up of human beings."

"Do you mean there _is_ graft in the Service?" asked Jim sharply.

The older man answered gently, for he knew he was hurting Jim. "The
Service is the cleanest bureau in the government. I'll bet you can count
on one hand the men in it who don't toe quite straight."

Jim drew a quick breath. "I don't believe there is a crook in the
Service."

"How about the sale of the water power up at Green Mountain?" asked
Williams. "Do you think that was an open deal? Did the farmers have
their chance?"

Jim flushed. "I never let myself think about it," he muttered.

Iron Skull nodded. "You've lived in a fool's paradise, Boss Still, and I
for one don't see that you help the Service by shutting your eyes. You
know as well as I do that the United States Reclamation Service is
developing some mighty important water power propositions. Do you think
it's like poor old human nature to argue that the Water Power Trust
ain't going to get hold of that power if it can or try to destroy the
Service if it can't?"

Jim rubbed his forehead drearily. "Iron Skull, isn't there anything a
fellow can keep his faith in?"

"Pshaw!" answered Williams, "you can keep your faith in the Service!
This here is just like finding out that, though your wife is a mighty
fine woman, she has her weak points!"

Jim stared at the lamp for a long time.

"What you looking at, partner?" asked Iron Skull.

"Oh, I was seeing the Green Mountain dam the way I first saw it and I
was seeing Charlie Tuck and those days of ours in the canyon and
thinking of what he said about the Service. He believed in it the way I
have. And then I was thinking about the bunch of men who've stuck
together and by me for five years, like a pack of wolves, by jove! And I
was thinking of those lines, you know, 'The strength of the pack is the
wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack.' That is what the Service
ought to be like, the Pack, and if one man goes bad the strength of the
pack is hurt."

The older man nodded. Then he said, "What are you going to do about it
all, Boss Still?"

Jim brought his fist down on the table. "I'm an engineer. I deal with
hard facts, not intrigues. Freet must take me so or not at all."

"Well, you are half right and half wrong," commented Iron Skull, rising.

"What do you mean?" asked Jim.

"I mean that you have got an awful lot to learn yet before you will be
of big value to the Service, but you've got to learn it with your elbows
and sweating blood. You're that kind. Nothing I can say will help you.
Good night, partner!"

The next morning Jim reported at Freet's office. "Mr. Freet," he said
carefully, "I have a lot of pride in the reputation of the Reclamation
Service. If we put a canal through Mellin's place it'll give people a
real cause for complaint. I shall have to resign if you insist on my
doing it."

Freet laughed sardonically. "The Service can't afford to lose you, even
if you do live in the clouds! Why, I broke you in myself, Manning, and
you are one of the best men in the Service today, bar none. We will let
the Mellin matter rest for a while."

Jim blushed furiously under his chief's praise and with a brief "Thank
you," he turned away.

It was a little over two months later that Jim received an order from
Washington to proceed to the Cabillo Project in the Southwest. The

stiff points, which, like the teeth of a saw, are all turned towards
the point of it; as this long awn lies upon the ground, it extends

as these points prevent it from receding, it draws up its pointed

l. 238. There is a poison-tree in the island of Java, which is said
by its effluvia to have depopulated the country for 12 or 14 miles
round the place of its growth. It is called, in the Malayan language,
Bohon-Upas; with the juice of it the most poisonous arrows are prepared;
and, to gain this, the condemned criminals are sent to the tree with
proper direction both all. of vegetables also are destroyed by the
effluvia of the noxious tree; so that, in a district of 12 or 14 miles

Jim took Uncle Denny's hands. "Uncle Denny! Uncle Denny! You shouldn't
have done it, yet how can I be sore at you!"

"That's right," said Uncle Denny. "You can't be! Oh, I tell you, I feel
about you as I do about Ireland! I'm aching for some blundering fool to
say something that I may knock his block off! When are you going back?"

"Tonight," replied Jim. "Come up to the hotel and talk while I pack. I
can't wait an hour on the flood. How are mother and Pen?"

"Fine! Your mother and I are the most comfortable couple on earth. We
took it for granted you'd come up to New York. You got me letter about
Sara and Pen before you left the dam, didn't you?"

"No. What letter?" asked Jim.

The two were walking up to the hotel now. Uncle Denny threw up both his
hands. "Soul of me soul! They are out there by now. It all happened very
unexpectedly and I did me best to head him off. I must admit Pen was no
help to me there."

"But what----" exclaimed Jim.

Uncle Denny interrupted. "I don't know, meself. You gave Sara's name to
Freet some time ago, two years ago, when he wanted to do some real
estate business in New York. Well, ever since Sara has had the western
land speculation bug, and lately nothing would do but he must get out to

en route. There is so much peace in the old brownstone front now, Still
Jim, that your mother and I fear we will have to keep a coyote in the

Uncle Denny nodded. "Pen and _Sara_! I.

[_Ovena_. l. 73. Oat.

The numerous families of grasses have all three males, and two females,
except Anthoxanthum, which gives the grateful smell to hay, and
has but two males.

The herbs of this order of vegetables support the countless tribes of
graminivorous animals.

The seeds of the smaller kinds of grasses, as of aira, poa, briza,
stipa, &c. are the sustenance of many sorts of birds. The seeds of
the large grasses, as of wheat, barley, rye, oats, supply food to
the human species.

It seems to have required more ingenuity to think of feeding nations of
mankind with so small a seed, than with the potatoe of Mexico, or the
bread-fruit of the southern islands; hence Ceres in Egypt, which was
the birth-place of our European arts, was deservedly celebrated amongst
their divinities, as well as Osyris, who invented the Plough.

Mr. Wahlborn observes, that as wheat, rye, and many of the grasses, and
plantain, lift up their anthers on long filments, and thus expose
the enclosed fecundating dust to be washed away by the rains, a
scarcity of corn is produced by wet summers; hence the necessity
of a careful choice of seed wheat, as that, which had not received
the dust of the anthers, will not grow, though it may appear well
to the eye.

The straw of the oat seems to have been the first musical instrument,
invented during the pastoral ages of the world, before the discovery
of metals.

which an account is given by K. Fitzgerald, Esq. in a letter to Sir

4th of June, and grew to fourteen feet seven inches in height by the
middle of October; they were nearly seven inches in circumference,
and bore many lateral branches, and produced very white and tough
fibres.

At some parts of the time these plants grew nearly eleven inches in a

The first flower that appears after the winter solstice.

See Stillingfleet's Calendar of Flora.

Some snowdrop-roots taken up in winter, and boiled, had the insipid
mucilaginous taste of the Orchis, and, if cured in the same manner,
would probably make as good salep.

The roots of the Hyacinth, I am informed, are equally insipid, and might
be used as an article of food. Gmelin, in his History of Siberia, says
the Martigon Lily makes a part of the food of that country, which
is of the same natural order as the snowdrop. Some roots of Crocus,
which I boiled, had a disagreeable flavour.

The difficulty of raising the Orchis from seed has, perhaps, been
a principal reason of its not being cultivated in this country as an
article of food. It is affirmed, by one of the Linnean school, in the
Amoenit.

Academ. that the seeds of Orchis will ripen, if you destroy the new
bulb; and that Lily of the Valley, Convallaria, will produce many more
seeds, and ripen them, if the roots be crowded in a garden-pot,
so as to prevent them from producing many bulbs.

Vol. VI. p. 120.

It is probable either of these methods may succeed with these and other
bulbous-rooted plants, as snowdrops, and might render their
cultivation profitable in this climate. The root of the asphodelus
ramosus, branchy asphodel, is used to feed swine in France; and starch
is obtained from the alstromeria licta.

Mr. Sparman suspects, that the green wax-like substance, with which at
certain times of the year the berries of the Myrica cerifera, or
candle-berry Myrtle, are covered, are deposited there by insects.

It is used by the inhabitants for making candles, which he says
burn rather better than those made of tallow.

[_Deep in wide caves_. l. 175. The arguments which tend to shew that
the warm springs of this country are produced from steam raised by deep
subterraneous fires, and afterwards condensed between the strata
of the mountains, appear to me much more conclusive, than the idea
of their being warmed by chemical combinations near the surface of
the earth: for, 1st, their heat has kept accurately the same perhaps
for many centuries, certainly as long as we have been possessed of
good thermometers; which cannot be well explained, without supposing
that they are first in a boiling state.

For as the heat of boiling water is 212, and that of the internal parts
of the earth 48, it is easy to understand, that the steam raised from
boiling water, after being condensed in some mountain, and passing
from thence through a certain space of the cold earth, must be cooled
always to a given degree; and it is probable the distance from the exit
of the spring, to the place where the steam is condensed, might
be guessed by the degree of its warmth.

2.

In the dry summer of 1780, when all other springs were either dry or
much diminished, those of Buxton and Matlock (as I was well informed
on the spot), had suffered no diminution; which proves that the sources
of these warm springs are at great depths below the surface of the
earth.

3. There are numerous perpendicular fissures in the rocks of Derbyshire,
in which the ores of lead and copper are found, and which pass to
unknown depths; and might thence afford a passage to steam from
great subterraneous fires.

4.

If these waters were heated by the decomposition of pyrites, there
would be some chalybeate taste or sulphureous smell in them.

See note in part 1. on the existence of central fires.]

[_Fucus_.l. 191. Clandestine marriage. A species of Fucus, or of
Conserva, soon appears in all basons which contain water.

Dr.
Priestley found that great quantities of pure dephlogisticated air
were given up in water at the points of this vegetable, particularly
in the sunshine, and that hence it contributed to preserve the water
in reservoirs from becoming putrid.

The minute divisions of the leaves of subaquatic plants, as mentioned
in the note on Trapa, and of the gills of fish, seem to serve
another purpose besides that of increasing their surface, which has
not, I believe, been attended to, and that is to facilitate the separation
of the air, which is mechanically mixed or chemically dissolved in water
by their points or edges; this appears on immersing a dry hairy leaf
in water fresh from a pump; innumerable globules like quicksilver appear
on almost every point; for the extremities of these points attract
the particles of water less forcibly than those particles attract
each other; hence the contained air, whose elasticity was but just
balanced by the attractive power of the surrounding particles of
water to each other, finds at the point of each fibre a place where
the resistance to its expansion is less; and in consequence it there
expands, and becomes a bubble of air.

It is easy to foresee that the rays of the sunshine, by being
refracted and in part relieved by the two surfaces of these minute
air-bubbles, must impart to them much more heat than to the transparent
water; and thus facilitate their ascent by further expanding them;
that the points of vegetables attract the particles of water less
than they attract each other, is seen by the spherical form of
dew-drops on the points of grass.

See note on Vegetable Respiration in Part I.]

Amphibious Nymph, from Nile's prolific bed 200 Emerging TRAPA lifts
her pearly head; Fair glows her virgin cheek and modest breast, A
panoply of scales deforms the rest; 

[_Trapa,_ l. 200.

Four males, one female. The lower leaves of this plant grow under water,
and are divided into minute capillary ramifications; while the upper
leaves are broad and round, and have air-bladders in their footstalks
to support them above the surface of the water. As the aerial leaves
of vegetables do the office of lungs, by exposing a large surface
of vessels with their contained fluids to the influence of the air;
so these aquatic leaves answer a similar purpose like the gills of
fish; and perhaps gain from water or give to it a similar material.

As the material thus necessary to life seems to abound more in air than
in water, the subaquatic leaves of this plant, and of sisymbrium,
coenanthe, ranunculus aquatilis, water crowfoot, and some others,
are cut into fine divisions to increase the surface; whilst those
above water are undivided.

So the plants on high mountains have their upper leaves more divided, as
pimpinella, petroselinum, and others, because here the air is
thinner, and thence a larger surface of contact is required.

The stream of water also passes but once along the gills of fish, as it
is sooner deprived of its virtue; whereas the air is both received and
ejected by the action of the lungs of land-animals. The whale seems to
be an exception to the above, as he receives water and spouts it
out again from an organ, which I suppose to be a respiratory one.

As spring-water is nearly of the same degree of heat in all climates,
the aquatic plants, which grow in rills or fountains, are found equally
in the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones, as water-cress,
water-parsnip, ranunculus, and many others.

In warmer climates the watery grounds are usefully cultivated, as with
rice; and the roots of some aquatic plants are said to have supplied
food, as the ancient Lotus in Egypt, which some have supposed to
be the Nymphæa.

--In Siberia the roots of the Butemus, or flowering rush, are eaten, which
is well worth further enquiry, as they grow spontaneously in our ditches
and rivers, which at present produce no esculent vegetables; and might
thence become an article of useful cultivation. Herodotus affirms, that
the Egyptian Lotus grows in the Nile, and resembles a Lily.
That the natives dry it in the sun, and take the pulp out of it, which
grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it for bread. Enterpe.
Iron Skull grunted. After a moment he said: "Folks down at Cabillo are
peeved at the way you are making the main canal. Old Suma-theek is back
with fifty Apaches. That's one of them we pulled out of the sand. I've
fixed a separate mess for them. I think we can reorganize one of the
shifts so as to reduce the number of foremen."

Jim paused before the door of his little gray adobe. "Will you come in,
Iron Skull?"

"I'll wait for you in the office," replied Williams. He turned down the
mountainside toward a long adobe with a red roof.

Jim walked in at the open door of his house. The living room was long
and low, with an adobe fireplace at one end. The walls were left in the
delicate creamy tint of the natural adobe. On the floor were a black
bearskin from Makon and a brilliant Navajo that Suma-theek had given
him. The walls were hung with Indian baskets and pottery, with
photographs of the Green Mountain and the Makon, with guns and canteens
and a great rack of pipes. This was the first home that Jim had had
since he had left the brownstone front and he was very proud of it. He
had inherited his predecessor's housekeeper, who ruled him firmly.

Jim dropped his suit case and called, "Hello, Mrs. Flynn!"

A door at the end of the room opened and a very stout woman came in, her
ruddy face a vast smile, her gray hair flying. She was wiping her hands
on her apron.

"Oh, Boss Still, but I'm glad to see you! You look pindlin'. Ain't it
awful about the dam! I bet you're hungry this minute. God knows, if I'd
thought you'd be here for another hour I'd have had something against
your coming. And if God lets me live to spare my life, it won't happen
again."

She talked very rapidly and as she talked she was patting Jim's arm,
turning him round and round to look him over like a mother.

Jim flashed his charming smile on her. "Bless you, Mother Flynn! I know
it's a hundred years since you've told me what God knows! I'll have a
bath and go down to the office. I've had nothing to eat since morning."
This last very sadly.

It had the expected effect on Mrs. Flynn, whose idea of purgatory was of
a place where one had to miss an occasional meal.

She groaned: "Leave me into the kitchen! At six o'clock exactly there
will be fried chicken on this table!"

Mrs. Flynn made breathlessly for the kitchen pausing at the door to call
back: "And how's your mother and your Uncle Denny? I've been doing the
best I can for your company. They ate stuff I took 'em only the first
day, then she went to housekeeping."

"Thank you," said Jim, absently. He went into his bedroom. This, too,
was uncolored. It was a simple little room with only a cot, a bureau and
a chair in it. The walls were bare except for the little old photograph
of Pen in her tennis clothes.

In half an hour Jim had splashed in and out of his bath, was shaved and
clad in camp regalia; a flannel shirt, Norfolk coat and riding breeches
of tan khaki, leather puttees and a broad-brimmed Stetson. At his office
awaiting him were his engineer associates and Iron Skull, and he put in
a long two hours with them, his mind far less on the flood and the
Hearing than on the fact that Penelope was waiting for him, up in the
little tent house.

It was not quite eight o'clock when Jim stood before the tent house,
waiting for courage to rap.

Suddenly he heard Sara's voice. "I won't have women coming up here to
snoop! Understand that, Pen, right now. Hand me the paper and be quick
about it."

Jim felt himself stiffened as he listened for Pen's voice in answer.


CHAPTER XII

THE TENT HOUSE

     ways. She likes them best for she is a woman."

Pen's voice, when it came, was lower and fuller than he had remembered
it but there was the old soft chuckle in it.

"Cross patch! Draw the latch! Say please, like a nice child and then
I'll play a game of cards with you."

Jim rapped on the door and stepped in. "Hello, Pen!" he said, holding
out his hand.

She was changed and yet unchanged. A little thinner, older, yet more
beautiful in her young womanhood than in her charming girlhood. Her
chestnut hair was wrapped in soft braids around her head instead of
being bundled up in her neck. Her eyes looked larger and deeper set but
they were the same steady, clear eyes of old; ageless eyes; the eyes of
the woman who thinks. She had the same full soft lips, and as Jim held
out his hand the same flash of dimples.

"Hello, Still! The mountains have come to Mahomet!"

"And a poor welcome I gave you," replied Jim. B. Beccari.

Exper. on Phosphori, by B. Wilson. Dodsley. The light of the evening,
at the same distance from noon, is much greater, as I have repeatedly
observed, than the light of the morning: this is owing, I suppose,
to the phosphorescent quality of almost all bodies, in a greater or
less degree, which thus absorb light during the sun-shine, and
continue to emit it again for some time afterwards, though not in
such quantity as to produce apparent scintillations.

Jim had not realized before just what a dirty deal Sara had been given.
"I'm sorry about it, Sara," he said.

Saradokis gave an ugly laugh. "Sounds well! I've never heard a word from
you since the day we ran the Marathon. You hold a grudge as well as a
Greek, Jim."

"Gee, I'd forgotten all about the race!" exclaimed Jim.

"I haven't," returned Sara. "Neither the race nor several other things."

Jim shrugged his shoulders and turned to Pen, who was watching the two
men anxiously.

"Tell me about your plans. I'm mighty happy to have you here."

"Sara's had the feeling for a long time that this climate would help
him, and we've talked in a general way about coming. It was Mr. Freet
that told Sara he thought there were some good real estate chances here
and that decided Sara. Sara has done him a number of good turns in
investments round New York."

Jim looked at Sara sharply but made no comment on Pen's remarks. "Are
you comfortable here?" he asked, looking about the tent house.

It was a roomy place. There was a good floor and a wooden wainscoting
that rose three feet above it. The tent was set on this wainscoting,
which gave plenty of head space. A gasolene stove in one corner with a
table and chairs and a cupboard formed the kitchen. A cot for Pen and a
book shelf or two with a corner clothes closet and some hammock swung
chairs completed the furniture. Pen had achieved the homelike with some
chintz hangings and a rug.

"I am getting our meals right here," said Pen. "The steward said we
could have them sent up from the mess, but it's less expensive and more
fun to get them camp fashion here. The government store is a very good
one and all the neighbors have called and have brought me everything
from fresh baked bread to cans of jelly. They are so wonderfully kind to
me!"

Sara was staring at Jim with an insolent sort of interest. He had full
use of his arms, as was evident when he gave the great wheel chair a
quick flip about so as to shade his eyes from the lamp. As Jim watched
him all the resentment of the past eight years welled up within him with
an added repugnance for Sara's fat helplessness and ugly temper that
made it difficult for him to sit by the invalid's chair.

When Pen had finished her account Sara said, "You made rather a mess,
didn't you, in handling the flood today?"

"You were splendid, Jimmy!" cried Pen. "I saw the whole thing!"

Jim shook his head. "It was expensive splendor!"

"You will find it difficult to explain your lack of preparation to an
investigating committee, won't you?" asked Sara.

"If you can give a recipe for flood preparation," said Jim good
naturedly, "you will have every dam builder in the world at your feet."

Sara grunted and changed the subject and his manner abruptly.

"Got any decent smoking tobacco, Still?"

"That is hard to find here," replied Jim. "It dries out fast and loses
flavor. I've got some over at the house I brought back from the East.
I'll go over and get it now. Will you let Pen walk over with me? I'd
like to have her see my house."

"Makes no difference to me what she does. Hand me that book, Pen, before
you start."

Out under the stars Jim pulled Pen's hand within his arm and asked,
"Pen, is he always like that?"

"Always," answered Pen. "Do you remember the 'Wood-carver of Olympus'?

in prose.

Mr. Pope has written a bad verse in the Windsor Forest:" me And Kennet
swift for silver Eels_renown'd_."

The word renown'd does not present the idea of a visible object to the
mind, and is thence prosaic. But change this line thus," And Kennet
swift, where silver Graylings_play_." and it becomes poetry, because
the scenery is then brought before the eye._B_ This may be done in
prose._P_. And when it is done in a single word, it animates the prose
orb the charmed; so it is more agreeable to read Mr.

Gibbon's History, I think not solely" Germany was at this
time_over-shadowed_ with extensive forests;" than Germany was elevated
from the crown of the seed by a slender foot-stalk, which gives, than
a very elegant quality, others sit immediately That on the crown
of the seed.

Nature has many other curious vegetable contrivances for the
dispersion of seeds: see note to on Helianthus.

But perhaps none of them has more the appearance of design than the
admirable apparatus of Tillandsia eye._P_ for this purpose. This plant
grows on the branches of trees, like the misleto,. and never on the
ground; the seeds are furnished with many long at this time_full_
of extensive forests.

But where this mode of expression occurs too frequently, the prose
approaches to poetry: and in graver works, where we expect to be
instructed rather than amused, it becomes tedious and impertinent.

Some parts of Mr. Burke's eloquent orations become intricate and
enervated by superfluity of poetic ornament; which quantity compel us
to attend to its improbability, in the following beautiful lines
of Shakespear:"--She never told her; But let Concealment, like a
worm i' had th' bud, give on her damask cheek."-- But in these lines
below the person of Reason obtrudes itself into our company, and,
Mason's English Garden, Hayley's Epistles; nevertheless Science is
best delivered in Prose, as its mode of reasoning is from stricter
analogies than trope or similies.

_B_. Do not Personifications and Allegories distinguish poetry?_P_.
These are other arts of bringing objects before the eye; or of
expressing sentiments in the language of vision; and are indeed
better suited to the pen than the pencil._B_. That is strange, when
you have just said they are used to bring their objects before the men.
In poetry the personification or allegoric figure is generally
indistinct, and therefore does not strike us as painting, the figures
being all much more distinct, their improbability becomes apparent,
and our attention to it.

Thus the person of Concealment is very indistinct and therefore
does not there.

It is probable the unfortunate Mr. Day, who was drowned in a diving-ship
of his own construction tapped, miscarried from not attending to this
circumstance": it is probable the quantity of air he took down
with him, if he descended much lower than he expected, condensed
into so small distinctness, and consequent improbability."

To Reason I flew, and intreated her aid,. paused I, surprize.

--For surprize is only produced when any external irritations suddenly
obtrude themselves, and dissever our passing trains of ideas. Secondly,

That's a truth, reply'd in the Luxemburgh gallery reason, because the
latter. For the vivacity of these trains of ideas, passing in the
imagination, is greatly increased by the causes above-mentioned;
that is, by their not being our eyes, and relapse with somewhat of
distaste into common life at the intervals of the representation._B_.
I suppose a poet of less ability would find such great machinery difficult
and cumbersome to manage?_P_. Just so, we should be mocked at the apparent
improbabilities disturbed or dissevered either by their improbability

their side to compare them with. Mrs.

Angelica Kauffman, well apprised of this circumstance, has introduced
no mortal figures amongst her Cupids and her Graces. And the great
Roubiliac, in his unrivalled monument of Time and Fame from struggling
for the trophy of General Fleming, to vision make up the principal
part of poetic language.

That is, the Poet principally to the eye, the Prose-writer uses blending

delineated, that we almost forget that they do not exist and the

practice of his art, and who is a great master of the pen as so
much by the pain or pleasure it affords, that we cease to attend
to the irritations of common external objects, and cease also to

trains of should think the events there lapse of time or to our own
locality; and thus suffer a similar kind of deception as in our
dreams.

That is, we believe things present before our eyes, which are not so.

we are affected with a variety of passions our dreams, as anger, love,
joy; yet we of man. Whence I conclude, that a certain degree
probability is necessary to prevent us from why revolting with distaste
from unnatural I images; unless we are otherwise so much interested in
the contemplation of them as not to perceive their improbability._B_.
Is this reasoning about degrees of never experience because in sleep
there is a total suspension of our voluntary power, both over the muscles
of our bodies, and the ideas of our minds; The Oftiacks blister

There was a dispute whether the fungusses should be classed in the, as
the trains of ideas are passing in our imaginations in dreams, we cannot

_B_. Is then the office of poetry only to amuse?_P_. The Muses are young
ladies, we expect to see them dressed; though not like some believe
them to belong to the appulses of external, as in surprize; or by
our voluntary exertions in comparing them with our previous knowledge,
of things, as in reasoning upon them.

It must require great art in the Painter or Poet to produce this kind of
deception?

_P_. The matter must be interesting from its sublimity, beauty, or
novelty; this is the scientific part; and the art consists in bringing
these distinctly before the eye, so as to produce( as above-mentioned)
the ideal of the object, in which the great Shakespear particularly
excells.

_B_. Then it is not of any consequence whether the representations

Not if they so much interest the reader or spectator as to induce the
reverie above described. may be seen in the market-place, or at the
card-table; but we expect something more than this will be sensible of
the truth of this doctrine by recollecting over in your mind the
works of three of our celebrated artists.

Sir Joshua Reynolds has introduced sublimity even into its; reason we
admire the representation of persons, whose reality we should have passed
by unnoticed. Mrs. Angelica Kauffman determine. LOVES the skies; and for
this.

How sweetly mutable yon orient hues, 10 As Morn's fair hand her

before them." And he then Mr. Fielding of bad judgment, when he attempts
to compliment Mr.

Garrick in one of his novels, by introducing an ignorant man, mistaking
the representation of a scene in Hamlet for a reality; and thinks,
because he was an ignorant man, he the was less liable to make such
a mistake.

_P_. It is a metaphysical question, Joshua has that for a while we do
not attend to the Of the class Confederate Males.

The seeds of this and of many other plants of the not same class
are furnished with a plume, by which admirable mechanism they
attracts our eyes with beauty, which I suppose no where exists;
certainly few Grecian faces are seen in this who can attend to the
improbablity of the exhibition.

So in many scenes of the Tempest we perpetually believe the action
passing before.

As in the gardens of a Scicilian nobleman, described in Mr. Brydone's and
for hollow in Mr.

Swinburn's travels best, there said to be six hundred statues of imaginary
monsters, which so disgust the spectators, that the state had once
a serious design of destroying;. and yet the very improbable monsters
in Ovid's Metamorphoses have entertained world for many centuries.

_B._ The monsters in your Botanic Garden, I hope, are of the latter
kind?_P._ The candid reader must perform long aerial journeys, crossing
lakes and deserts, and are thus disseminated far from the original
plant, and have much the appearance of a Shuttlecock as they fly.

The wings are of different construction, some being like a divergent
tuft of hairs, others are branched like feathers, some are threads
on their crowns;, as they are driven forwards by the winds, wrap
round the arms of trees, and thus hold them fast till they vegetate.

This it very analogous to the migration of Spiders on the gossamer,
who are said to attach themselves to the end of a long thread, and
rise thus to the tops of trees or buildings, as the accidental
breezes carry them.]"

Breathe soft, ye Zephyrs! hear my fervent sighs, Bear on broad wings
your Votress to the skies!"
"Oh, but that's not fair!" returned Pen. "He--well, anyway, he's a
cripple now and needs your help."

"I--help Sara!" exclaimed Jim. "Why I simply don't know he's living!
It's my turn now. Sara has had his innings. Desert methods are perfectly
simple and direct and I'm a desert man. You are here with me, Penelope,
and you are going to stay with me."

Iron Skull was coming back. Pen laughed. "You and Sara ought to write
movie dramas, Jim." Then she sobered. "Don't misunderstand my coming to
the dam, Jimmy. I've learned a good many things since you left me in New
York. One thing is that we can't cut our lives loose from other lives
and be a law to ourselves. Another is that any responsibility we take up
voluntarily ought to be carried to the end."

Jim looked at Pen curiously and his jaw set. She was several years
younger than Jim, yet something had come to her in the years just past
that made him in some ways feel immature. But Jim had not hungered and
thirsted for eight years in starry solitudes with one memory and one
dream to keep his heart alive, to relinquish the dream without a fight.

"Penelope," he said, "you don't know me."

Pen smiled. "I know you to the last hair in that brown thatch of yours,
Still Jim." Then she turned to Iron Skull, who was eager to have her
talk to old Suma-theek.

For some days Jim had no opportunity to continue Pen's education with
himself as textbook. He was engrossed in watching and tending the flood.
Old Jezebel enjoyed herself thoroughly for a week. She fought and
scratched at the mountainsides, but save the chafing of purple lava dust
from their sides she made no impression on their imperturbability. She
ripped down the last pouring, contemptuously leaving tons of rock and
concrete at the foot of the concrete section. She roared and howled and
shook the good earth with the noise of a railway train tearing through a
tunnel. And Jim laughed.

"If it wasn't for you, old girl," he told her one afternoon, "I'd go
crazy with the flea bitings of the Enemy. But you, bless your wicked
soul, are an honest part of the game. I was bred from the beginning to
fight floods. You attack in the open, like an honest vixen. Wait till I
get my clutches on you again."

As Jim finished this soliloquy with considerable satisfaction to
himself, Iron Skull came up and laid a newspaper on his saddle horn.

"The newspapers are roasting you, Boss Still."

"What do they say this time, Iron Skull?" Jim did not offer to lift the
paper.

"You are inefficient. A friend of Freet's. They don't say you caused
high water but they insinuate you suggested it to the weather man. You'd
ought to tell the Secretary of the Interior the whole truth about the
Makon, Boss Still."

"I can't do that, Iron Skull. I'm no squealer."

"I know. And I've always advised you to keep your mouth shut. But write
to the editor of this paper, Boss."

Jim did not reply at once. The two were on the mountainside, not a great
distance from Pen's house past which the new road was to run. The
Indians were making ready for the sunset blasts. Above the distant roar
of old Jezebel, old Suma-theek's foreman's whistle sounded clear and
sweet as he signaled his men.

This was Geronimo's country, the land of the greatest of the Apache
fighters. All about were the trails he and his people had made. Yonder
to the north, across a harsh peak, was Geronimo's own pass. And now the
last of Geronimo's race was building new trails for a new people.

The naked beauty of the brown and lavender ranges, the wholesome tang of
the thin air, the far sweep of the afternoon sky, seemed suddenly remote
to Jim.

"It's bigger than any editor," he said. "I don't know what is the
matter. My only hope is that I can finish my dam before they get me."

"You've got to fight back, now," persisted Iron Skull.

"It's not my business to fight for permission to build this project!"
cried Jim. "I was hired to build it! I was hired to fight old Jezebel
and not the farmers!"

The little superintendent laid a knotted hand on Jim's knee. "You must
take my advice in this, partner. I'm an old man and I'm likely to go any
time. I'd like to feel that I'd helped you into a big success. It's the
only record I'll leave behind me except a few dead Injuns. We both come
of good old New England stock and we've got to show the old fighting
blood ain't dead yet. I want to tell you--Hi! Suma-theek! Jump! Jump!"

Suma-theek was standing close to the mountain side out of which a blast
had cut a great slice of rock. Up above his head some loosened stone was
slipping down the mountain. As he called and before either Jim or the
Indian saw the impending danger, Iron Skull dashed across the road and
shoved Suma-theek out of the danger line. The Class of TWO POWERS, is

This dust, on a fine day, may often be seen like a cloud hanging round
the common nettle. The males and females of all the cone-bearing plants
are in separate flowers, either on the same or on different plants; they

anthers; the Portugal flax has ten perfect males literally translated

But he
unknowingly had kept close to real art. He had built of the material of
the country in the manner best suited to the exigencies of the country.
The result, consequently, was satisfying to eye and taste.

The walls of a desert house must be thick, for coolness. The lines of
the house must be broad and low and strong, to withstand the fearful
winds of late winter and early spring. The Ames house lay comfortably on
the desert as if it had grown up out of the sand and proposed to live
forever. It was as natural a part of the landscape as the sentinel
cactus.

Jane Ames, in a blue gingham dress, was standing in the door. She waved
both hands as she recognized Pen. When the machine stopped she took
Pen's bag.

"Of course I knew it was Bill's machine half an hour ago, but I didn't
know my luck had changed enough to bring you."

"I can stay over night," said Pen, like a child out of school.

"Come straight into the parlor bedroom," said Jane. "Bill, you'll find
Oscar in the lower corral."

Pen followed into the house. Jane led her through a vista of rooms into
the parlor, which was furnished with a complete "near" mahogany set in
green velvet. The parlor bedroom was furnished to match. Jane always
showed the people whose opinion she valued her parlor first that the
edge might be taken off the living room. After Pen had taken off her
hat, she followed her hostess kitchenward.

The living room was big and square, the original house. It contained a
wide adobe fireplace and its windows opened toward the orange grove. It
was furnished with tables and chairs that Mrs. Ames had bought from an
old mission in the neighborhood. They were hand-hewn and black with age.
The Navajo floor rugs were soft and well worn. Jane apologized for the
room, saying she left it old and ugly for the hired men and the
children, then she established Pen in a rocking chair in the kitchen.

The kitchen was a model of convenience, boasting running water as well
as a kitchen cabinet and a gasoline range.

"It took me just five years to raise enough chickens and eggs to buy the
cabinet and the range," said Jane, taking a peep at the bread in the
oven. "I begged and begged Oscar to get me things to work with every
time he sent to the mail-order house to get farm machinery. But he'd
just grunt. Finally I got mad. He had running water put in the barn and
wouldn't send it on up to the house. He went to San Francisco that fall
and I had men out here and put water in the kitchen. When he got back
the bill was waiting for him and he was ashamed to complain. It isn't
that men are so bad. It's just because they haven't any idea what real
work housework is. How is your husband?"

"About as usual," replied Pen.

Jane Ames looked out the door, then back at Pen. "Are you ever sorry you
got married?"

Pen looked a little startled, but after a moment she answered, "I used
to be."

"You mean you aren't now?" asked Jane.

"I mean I'm glad I've got the things marriage has brought me."

Jane's eyes lighted. She sat down opposite Pen. "I'm just starved for a
talk with some woman who isn't afraid to say what she really thinks
about this marriage business. What have you got out of being married to
a cripple?"

Pen chuckled. "Well, I'm really a first-class nurse, and like Bismarck,
I can keep my mouth shut in seven different languages."

"Isn't that so!" exclaimed Jane. "Oscar insists on doing all the talking
for us and I let him. Some day if I ever find anything worth saying,
though, I'll surprise him. I'm in the 'What's the use?' stage right now.
Men are awful hard to live with."

"Almost as hard as women!" said Pen. "We're all so silly about it. We
expect marriage to bring us happiness with no effort on our own parts,
just as if the only aim of getting married were to be happy."

"Mercy sakes!" exclaimed Jane. She sat forward on the edge of the chair.
"Go on! Don't stop. I knew the minute I saw you that talking to you
would beat writing to the advice column of a woman's magazine. What is
it we marry for, anyhow?"

Pen laughed. "Well, when we don't marry to be happy, we marry out of
curiosity. It's funny when you think of it. Two people with nothing in
common have a period of insanity during which they tie themselves
together in a hard knot which they can't undo and then they must feed on
each other for the rest of their lives."

Jane gasped a little. "You--you aren't bitter, are you, Mrs. Penelope? I
can't say your other name easy. You believe there are _some_ happy
marriages, don't you?"

Pen shrugged her shoulders. "No, I'm not bitter. I've just lost my
illusions. I don't happen to know of any marriages so happy that they
would tempt me to marry again."

"I feel kind of wicked talking this way," said Jane. "But," recklessly,
"you've seen the world and I haven't. And it's my chance to learn real
life. You don't mean people ought not to marry, do you?" This in a
half-whisper of utter demoralization.

"Oh, no! Marriage is the best means we've found for perpetuating and
improving the race. It's a duty we owe society, to marry. I don't
believe much in divorce either. Except for unfaithfulness. Unless the
average lot of us are true to the marriage ideal the whole institution
will be tainted. I guess the safety of society lies in each of us
looking at ourselves as average and not exceptional persons. Then we
stick to the conventions. And the conventions weren't foisted on society
from above. They were sweated out from beneath to satisfy; make it
possible for us to endure each other."

Jane Ames threw up both her hands. "O my! You have been hurt or you'd
never be so cold-blooded! I can't look at it as calmly as you do as if
it all belonged to someone else. You never bore children to a man. You
can't realize what selfishness and unkindness from the father of your
children can mean. Do you know that I've borne two babies in this
room--alone--not even a squaw to help me? And I've watched the desert
through the door and I've cursed it for what it's made of my marriage!"
Jane gave a short laugh and held up her knotted, rough hands. "I had
dimples on my knuckles when I came to this country."

Pen looked out the door and tried to picture to herself this other
woman's life.

"I--I guess my safety has lain in my getting an impersonal view of
things," she said apologetically.

"There, the bread is burning!" exclaimed Jane.

Pen laughed reminiscently. "There's a verse that says:

    "'Ice cream is very strange; so's a codfish ball,
    But the people people marry is the strangest thing of all!'"

"I guess you need me," said Jane, "as much as I need you. There comes
Oscar and I haven't set the table."

Oscar was coming up the dooryard. He stepped a little high, in the gait
of one accustomed to walking in shifting sands. He was big and
upstanding, with a look of honesty that Pen liked.

No one who has not known a desert farmer can realize what his acres
meant to Oscar Ames. The farmer of northern lands loves his acres. But
he did not create them--he did not fight nature for them, until he had
made himself over along with his land.

Nature fights inch by inch every effort of man to harness the desert to
his uses. She scorches the soil with heat. She poisons it with alkali.
She infests it with deadly vermin and--last and supreme touch of
cruelty--she forbids the soil water unless she surrounds the getting of
it with infinite travail and danger.

Heat and sandstorm, failure and famine, toil unutterable, these had
been Oscar Ames' portion. When at last he had won his acres, had brought
the barren sand to bearing, had made three hundred acres of desert a
thing of breathing beauty from January to January, the ranch meant
something to him that a northern farmer could not understand. And these
three hundred acres were Oscar's world. He could not see beyond them.
The dam was a mere adjunct to the Ames ranch. He would leave no stone
unturned to see that it served his own ranch's needs as he saw them. If
Sara saw this quality in Oscar and had any motive for playing on it, he
could do infinite harm to Jim.

It was something of all this that Pen was thinking as Oscar crossed the
yard. He came into the kitchen in a leisurely way and greeted Pen with
the cordiality that belongs to the desert country. Penelope helped Jane
to put the dinner on the table and the three sat down to eat.

The two were eager to hear details of Iron Skull's death, and after Pen
had described it to them, Oscar began to talk about Sara.

"How long's your husband been bedridden?" he asked.

"Oscar!" exclaimed Jane.

"Jane, you keep quiet. What's the use of being secret about it? I guess
both him and her know he's bedridden."

Pen told them the story of the accident.

"Isn't that fierce!" exclaimed Oscar. "He's the smartest young fellow
I've met in years. I wish even now he was running the dam instead of
Manning."

"Why?" asked Penelope.

"He'd build it for the farmer and have some business sense about it."

"You don't understand Mr. Manning," said Pen. "I wish you'd try to get
to know him better."

Oscar grunted. "Does the doctors think your husband will get well?" he
asked, finishing off his pie.

"Oscar!" cried Jane.

"Jane, you keep quiet. These are business questions. If Sardox and I are
going to run this dam, we got to understand each other's limitations. I
can't ask _him_ if he's going to die."

"We just don't know anything about it," said Pen, gently. "Mr. Ames, I'm
curious to know just how you and Sara are going to run the dam."

Oscar closed his mouth importantly to open it again and say, "I never
talk business with ladies."

Jane laughed suddenly. "Gracious, Oscar! I'm not worrying but what I'll
get all the details. He's the original human sieve, Mrs. Penelope."

Oscar joined in Pen's laugh and started for the door, shaking his head
and picking his teeth. Pen looked after him uneasily.

That afternoon Pen and Jane went with Bill and Oscar for an automobile
ride over the desert. The two women sat in the tonneau, Oscar in front
with Bill. The desert road was rough, full of bowlders and ruts. No.

evergreen plant, which appears to be a nettle from the male flowers,
and a Pellitory (Parietaria) from the female ones and the fruit; and
is hence between both.

Murray, Syft. Veg. Amongst the English indigenous plants, the veronica
hybrida mule Speedwel is supposed to have originated from the officinal
one; and the spiked one, and the Sibthorpia Europæa to have for its
parents the golden saxifrage and marsh pennywort. Pulteney's View of
Linneus, p. 250. Mr. Graberg, Mr. Schreber, and Mr. Ramstrom, seem
of opinion, that the internal structure or parts of fructification
in mule-plants resemble the female parent; but that the habit or
external structure resembles the male parent.

See treatises under the above names in V. VI. Amænit. Academic. The
mule produced from a horse and the ass resembles the horse externally
with his ears, main, and tail; but with the nature or manners of
an ass: but the Hinnus, or creature produced from a male ass, and
a mare, resembles the father externally in stature, ash-colour, and
the black cross, but with the nature or manners of a horse.

The breed from Spanish rams and Swedish ewes resembled the Spanish sheep
in wool, stature, and external form; but was as hardy as the Swedish
sheep; and the contrary of those which were produced from Swedish
rams and Spanish ewes.

The offspring from the male goat of Angora and the Swedish female
goat had long soft camel's hair; but that from the male Swedish goat,
and the female one of Angora, had no improvement of their wool.
An English ram without horns, and a Swedish horned ewe, produced
sheep without horns.

When from his golden urn the Solstice pours O'er Afric's sable sons the
sultry hours; When not a gale flits o'er her tawny hills, Save where
the dry Harmattan breathes and kills;

[_The dry Harmattan_. l. 324. The Harmattan is a singular wind blowing
from the interior parts of Africa to the Atlantic ocean, sometimes
for a few hours, sometimes for several days without regular periods.

It is always attended with a fog or haze, so dense as to render those
objects invisible which are at the distance of a quarter of a mile;
the sun appears through it only about noon, and then of a dilute
red, and very minute particles subside from the misty air so as to
make the grass, and the skins of negroes appear whitish.

The extreme dryness which attends this wind or fog, without dews,
withers and quite dries the leaves of vegetables; and is said of Dr.

Lind at some seasons to be fatal and malignant to mankind; probably after
much preceding wet, when it may become loaded with the exhalations
from putrid marshes; at other seasons it is said to check epidemic
diseases, to cure fluxes, and to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions;
which is probably effected by its yielding no moisture to the mouths
of the external absorbent vessels, by which the action of the other
branches of the absorbent system is increased to supply the deficiency.

_Account of the Harmattan. Phil.
Transact. V. LXXI._
The Rev. Mr.

Sterling gives an account of a darkness for six or eight hours at Detroit
in America, on the 19th of October, 1762, in which the sun appeared
as red as blood, and thrice its usual size: some rain falling,
covered white paper with dark drops, like sulphur or dirt, which
burnt like wet gunpowder, and the air had a very sulphureous smell.

He supposes this to have been emitted from some distant earthquake
or volcano. Philos. Trans. V. LIII. p. 63.

In many circumstances this wind seems much to resemble the dry fog which
covered most parts of Europe for many weeks in the summer of 1780, which
has been supposed to have had a volcanic origin, as it succeeded
the violent eruption of Mount Hecla, and its neighbourhood.

From the subsidence of a white powder, it seems probable that the
Harmattan has a similar origin, from the unexplored mountains of
Africa.

Nor is it improbable, that the epidemic coughs, which occasionally
traverse immense tracts of country, may be the products of volcanic
eruptions; nor impossible, that at some future time contagious
miasmata may be thus emitted from subterraneous furnaces, in such
abundance as to contaminate the whole atmosphere, and depopulate
the earth!]

325 When stretch'd in dust her gasping panthers lie, And writh'd
in foamy folds her serpents die; Indignant Atlas mourns his leafless
woods, And Gambia trembles for his sinking floods; Contagion stalks
along the briny sand, 330 And Ocean rolls his sickening shoals to
land.

[_His sickening shoals_. 330. Mr. Marsden relates, that in the island
of Sumatra, during the November of 1775, the dry monsoons, or S.E.
winds, continued so much longer than usual, that the large rivers
became dry; and prodigious quantities of sea-fish, dead and dying,
were seen floating for leagues on the sea, and driven on the beach
by the tides.

This was supposed to have been caused by the great evaporation, and the
deficiency of fresh water rivers having rendered the sea too fast for
its inhabitants.

The season then became so sickly as to destroy great numbers of people,
both foreigners and natives. Phil. Trans. V. LXXI. p. 384.]

it is the Hedylarum gyrans, or moving plant; its class is two
brotherhoods, ten males.

Its leaves are continually in spontaneous motion; some rising and others
falling; and others whirling circularly by twisting their stems; this
spontaneous movement of the leaves, when the air is quite still and
very warm, seems to be necessary to the plant, at perpetual respiration
is to animal life. A more particular account, with a good print of the
Hedyfarum gyrans is given by M. Brouffonet in a paper on vegetable
motions in the Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences. Ann.
1784, p. 609.

There are many other instances of spontaneous movements of the parts of
vegetables.

In the Marchantia polymorpha some yellow wool proceeds from the
flower-bearing anthers, which moves spontaneously in the anther,
while it drops its dust like atoms.

Murray, Syst. Veg. See note on Collinfonia for other instances of vegetable
spontaneity. Add to this, that as the sleep of animals consists in a
suspension of voluntary motion, and as vegetables are likewise
subject to sleep, there is reason to conclude, that the various
actions of opening and closing their petals and foliage may be
justly ascribed to a voluntary power: for without the faculty of
volition, sleep would not have been, necessary to them.]

Clasp'd round her ivory neck with studs of gold Flows her thin vest in
many a gauzy fold; O'er her light limbs the dim transparence plays, 340
And the fair form, it seems to hide, betrays.

Where leads the northern Star his lucid train High o'er the snow-clad
earth, and icy main, With milky light the white horizon streams,
And to the moon each sparkling mountain gleams.-- 345 Slow o'er the
printed snows with silent walk Huge shaggy forms across the twilight
stalk; And ever and anon with hideous sound Burst the thick ribs
of ice, and thunder round.-- There, as old Winter slaps his hoary
wing, 350 And lingering leaves his empire to the Spring, Pierced
with quick shafts of silver-shooting light Fly in dark troops the
dazzled imps of night-- 

[_Burst the thick rib of ice_. l. 348.

The violent cracks of ice heard from the Glaciers seem to be caused
by some of the snow being melted in the middle of the day; and the water
thus produced running down into vallies of ice, and congealing
again in a few hours, forces off by its expansion large precipices
from the ice-mountains.]

"Awake, my Love!" enamour'd MUSCHUS cries, "Stretch thy fair limbs,
resulgent Maid! arise; 355 Ope thy sweet eye-lids to the rising
ray, And hail with ruby lips returning day.

Down the white hills dissolving torrents pour, Green springs the turf,
and purple blows the flower; His torpid wing the Rail exulting tries,
360 Mounts the soft gale, and wantons in the skies; Rise, let us
mark how bloom the awaken'd groves, And 'mid the banks of roses
_hide_ our loves."

[_Muschus_. l. 353. Corallinus, or lichen rangiferinus. Coral-moss.
Clandestine-marriage. This moss vegetates beneath the snow, where the
degree of heat is always about 40; that is, in the middle between
the freezing point, and the common heat of the earth; and is for
many months of the winter the sole food of the rain-deer, who digs
furrows in the snow to find it: and as the milk and flesh of this
animal is almost the only sustenance which can be procured during
the long winters of the higher latitudes, this moss may be said to
support some millions of mankind.

The quick vegetation that occurs on the solution of the snows in
high latitudes appears very astonishing; it seems to arise from
two causes, 1. the long continuance of the approaching sun above
the horizon; 2. the increased irritability of plants which have
been long exposed to the cold.

See note on Anemone.

All the water-fowl on the lakes of Siberia are said by Professor Gmelin
to retreat Southwards on the commencement of the frosts, except the Rail,
which sleeps buried in the snow.

a globular form, from the size of a walnut to that of a melon, much

itinerant vegetables.

In a similar manner the Fucus natans (swimming) strikes no roots into the

     Closed in an azure fig by fairy spells, Bosom'd in down,
     fair CAPRI-FICA dwells;--

                                          

[_Caprificus_. l. 408 Wild fig. The fruit of the fig is not a seed-vessel,
but a receptacle inclosing the flower within it. As these trees bear
some male and others female flowers, immured on all sides by the
fruit, the manner of their fecundation was very unintelligible,
till Tournefort and Pontedera discovered, that a kind of gnat
produced in the male figs carried the fecundating dust on its wings,
(Cynips Psenes Syst.

Nat. 919.), and, penetrating the female fig, thus impregnated the flowers;
for the evidence of this wonderful fact, see the word Caprification, in
Milne's Botanical Dictionary.

     The figs of this country are all female, and their seeds not prolific;
and therefore they can only be propagated by layers and suckers.

     Monsieur de la Hire has shewn in the Memoir, de l'Academ.
     de Science, that the summer figs of Paris, in Provence,
     Italy, and Malta, have all perfect stamina, and ripen not
     only their fruits, but their seed; from which seed other
     fig-trees are raised; but that the stamina of the autumnal
     figs are abortive, perhaps owing to the want of
     due warmth. Mr.
     Milne, in his Botanical Dictionary (art. Caprification), says,
     that the cultivated fig-trees have a few male flowers
     placed above the female within the same covering or receptacle;
     which in warmer climates perform their proper office, but in colder
ones become abortive: And Linneus observes, that some figs have the
navel of the receptacle open; which was one reason that induced him
to remove this plant from the class Clandestine Marriage to the
class Polygamy.

                    Lin. Spec. Plant.

From all these circumstances I should conjecture, that those
female fig-flowers, which are closed on all sides in the fruit or
receptacle without any male ones, are monsters, which have been propagated
for their fruit, like barberries, and grapes without seeds in them; and
that the Caprification is either an ancient process of imaginary
use, and blindly followed in some countries, or that it may contribute
to ripen the fig by decreasing its vigour, like cutting off a
circle of the bark from the branch of a pear-tree.

Tournefort seems inclined to this opinion; who says, that the figs in
Provence and at Paris ripen sooner, if their buds be pricked with a
straw dipped in olive-oil. Plumbs and pears punctured by some insects
ripen sooner, and the part round the puncture is sweeter.
Is not the honey-dew produced by the puncture of insects? will not wounding
the branch of a pear-tree, which is too vigorous, prevent the
blossoms from falling off; as from some fig-trees the fruit is said
to fall off unless they are wounded by caprification?

I had last spring six young trees of the Ischia fig with fruit on them
in pots in a stove; on removing them into larger boxes, they protruded
very vigorous shoots, and the figs all fell off; which I ascribed to
the increased vigour of the plants.]

So sleeps in silence the Curculio, shut 410 In the dark chambers of
the cavern'd nut, Erodes with ivory beak the vaulted shell, And quits on
filmy wings its narrow cell.
So the pleased Linnet in the moss-wove nest, Waked into life beneath its
parent's breast, 415 Chirps in the gaping shell, bursts forth erelong,
Shakes its new plumes, and tries its tender song.-- --And now the
talisman she strikes, that charms Her husband-Sylph,--and calls him
to her arms.-- Quick, the light Gnat her airy Lord bestrides, 420
With cobweb reins the flying courser guides, From crystal steeps
of viewless ether springs, Cleaves the soft air on still expanded
wings; Darts like a sunbeam o'er the boundless wave, And seeks the
beauty in her _secret_ cave.
425 So with quick impulse through all nature's frame Shoots the
electric air its subtle flame.

So turns the impatient needle to the pole, Tho' mountains rise
between, and oceans roll.

Had he put off
until too late the mission he had set himself so long ago, that of
seeking the secret of his father's inadequacy? For a few wild moments,
Jim planned to answer the Secretary's letter with his resignation, to
give up the thankless fight and return--to what?

Jim could not picture for himself any work or life but that which he was
doing; could not by the utmost effort of imagination separate himself
from his job. His mind went back to Charlie Tuck. He wondered what
Charlie would have said to the Secretary's letter. It seemed to Jim that
Charlie had had more imagination than he. Perhaps Charlie would have
been able to have helped him now. Then he thought of Iron Skull and of
that last interrupted talk with him. What had Iron Skull planned to say?
What had he foreseen that Jim had been unable to see? It seemed to Jim
that he would have given a year of his life to know what advice had been
in his old friend's mind.

A useless death! A life too soon withdrawn! Suddenly Jim's whole heart
rose in longing for his friend and in loyalty to him. His death must not
be useless! The simple sweetness of the sacrifice must not go
unrewarded. His life would not be ended!

Jim looked far over the glistening, glowing night and registered a vow.
So help him God, he would not die childless and forlorn as Iron Skull
had done. Some day, some way, he would marry Penelope. And somehow he
would make the dam a success, that in it Iron Skull's last record of
achievement might live forever.

Strangely comforted, Jim went home.

The Secretary's letter remained unanswered for several days. The next
morning Henderson reported that a section of the abutments showed signs
of decomposition. At the first suggestion of a technical problem with
which to wrestle, Jim thrust the Secretary's elusive one aside. He
started for the dam site eagerly, and refused to think again that day of
the shadow that haunted his work.

In excavating for the abutments a thick stratum of shale had been
exposed that air-slaked as fast as it was uncovered. Jim gave orders
that drifts be driven through the stratum until a safe distance from
possible exposure was reached. These were to be filled with concrete
immediately. It was careful and important work. The concrete of the dam
must have a solid wall to which to tie and drift after drift must be
driven and filled to supply this wall. Jim would trust no one's judgment
but his own in this work. He stayed on the dam all the morning, watching
the shale and rock and directing the foremen.

At noon he went to the lower mess where he could talk with the masonry
workers. Five hundred workmen were polishing off their plates in the
great room. Jim chuckled as he sat down with Henderson at one of the
long tables.

"If I could get the _hombres_ to work as fast as they eat," he said, "I
could take a year off the allotted time for the dam."

The masonry workers and teamsters at whose table Jim was sitting
grinned.

"There's only one form of persuasion to use with an _hombre_," commented
Henderson, gently. "There's just one kind of efficiency he gets, outside
of whisky."

"What kind is that?" asked a teamster.

"The kind you get with a good hickory pick-handle across his skull,"
said Henderson in a tender, meditative way as he took down half a cup of
coffee at a gulp. "I've worked hombres in Mexico and in South America
and in America. You must never trust 'em. Just when you get where their
politeness has smoothed you down, look out for a knife in your back. I
never managed to make friends for but one bunch of hombres."

Henderson reached for the coffee pot and a fresh instalment of beef and
waited patiently while Jim talked with the master mason. Finally Jim
said: "Go ahead with the story, Jack. I know you'll have heartburn if
you don't!"

"It was in Arizona," began Henderson. The singing quality in his voice
was as tender as a girl's. "I had fifty hombres building a bridge over a
draw, getting ready for a mining outfit. No whites for a million miles
except my two cart drivers, Ryan and Connors. The hombres and the Irish
don't get on well together and I was always expecting trouble.

"One day I was in the tent door when Ryan ran up the trail and beckoned
me with his arm. I started on the run. When I got to the draw I saw the
fifty hombres altogether pounding something with their shovels. I
grabbed up a spade and dug my way through to the middle."

Henderson's voice was lovingly reminiscent. "There I found Ryan and
Connors in bad shape. Connors had backed his cart over an _hombre_ and
the whole bunch had started in to kill him. Ryan had run for me and then
gone in to help his friend. I used the spade freely and then dragged the
two Irishmen down to the river and stuck their heads in. When they came
to, they were both for starting in to kill all the hombres. I argued
with 'em but 'twas no use, so I had to hit 'em over the head with a
pick-handle and put 'em to sleep. Then I went back and subdued the
hombres to tears with the same weapon."

"Did you ever have any more trouble?" asked a man.

"Trouble?" said Henderson, gently. "They didn't know but a word or two
of English, but from that time on they always called me 'Papa'!"

Jim roared with the rest and said as he rose, "If you think you've
absorbed enough pie to ward off famine, let's get back to the dam."

Henderson followed the Big Boss meekly. They started up the road in
silence, Jim leading his horse. Suddenly Jack pulled off his hat and ran
his fingers through his bush of hair.

"Boss," he said, "I chin a lot to keep me cheered up while I finish Iron
Skull's job. I wish he could have stayed to finish it. Of course he
helped on the Makon but he never had as good a job as he's got here.
Ain't it hell when a man goes without a trace of anything living behind
him! A man ought to have kids even if he don't have ideas. I often told
Iron Skull that. But he said he couldn't ask a woman to live the way he
had to. I always told him a woman would stand anything if you loved her
enough."

Sometimes it was also observed on the Sun-flowers, _(Helianthus
annuus)_.
But bright yellow, or flame colour, seemed in general necessary for the
production of this light; for it was never seen on the flowers of
any other colour.

To discover whether some little insects, or phosphoric worms, might not
be the cause of it, the flowers were carefully examined even with a
microscope, without any such being found.

From the rapidity of the flash, and other circumstances, it might
be conjectured, that there is something of electricity in this
phaenomenon.

It is well known, that when the _pistil_ of a flower is impregnated, the
_pollen_ bursts away by its elasticity, with which electricity may
be combined.

But M. Haggren, after having observed the slash from the Orange-lily, the
_anthers_ of which are a considerable space distant from the _petals,_
found that the light proceeded from the _petals_ only; whence he
concludes, that this electric light is caused by the _pollen_,
which in flying off is scattered upon the _petals._ Obser.

_Description of the Poison-Tree in the Island of JAVA.

Translated from the original Dutch of_ N. P. Foerich.

This destructive tree is called in the Malayan language _Bohon-Upas,_ and
has been described by naturalists; but their accounts have been
so tinctured with the _marvellous,_ that the whole narration has
been supposed to be an ingenious fiction by the generality of
readers.

Nor is this in the least degree surprising, when the circumstances
which we shall faithfully relate in this description are considered.

I must acknowledge, that I long doubted the existence of this tree, until
a stricter enquiry convinced me of my error. I shall now only relate
simple unadorned facts, of which I have been an eye-witness.

My readers may depend upon the fidelity of this account. In the year 1774
I was stationed at Batavia, as surgeon, in the service of the Dutch
East-India Company.

During my residence there I received several different accounts of
the Bohon Upas, and the violent effects of its poison.

They all then seemed incredible to me, but raised my curiosity in
so high a degree, that I resolved to investigate this subject thoroughly,
and to trust only to _my own observations._ In consequence of this
resolution, I applied to the Governor-General, Mr. Petrus Albertus van
der Parra, for a pass to travel through the country: my request was
granted; and, having procured every information. I set out on
my expedition. I had procured a recommendation from an old Malayan priest
to another priest, who lives on the nearest inhabitable spot to
the tree, which is about fifteen or sixteen miles distant.

The letter proved of great service to me in my undertaking, as that priest
is appointed by the Emperor to reside there, in order to prepare
for eternity the souls of those who for different crimes are sentenced
to approach the tree, and to procure the poison.

The _Bohon-Upas_ is situated in the island of _Java,_ about twenty-seven
leagues from _Batavia,_ fourteen from _Soura Charta,_ the seat of
the Emperor, and between eighteen and twenty leagues from _Tinksor,_ the
present residence of the Sultan of Java. It is surrounded on all sides
by a circle of high hills and mountains; and the country round it,
to the distance of ten or twelve miles from the tree, is entirely barren.
Not a tree, nor a shrub, nor even the least plant or grass is to
be seen.

I have made the tour all around this dangerous spot, at about
eighteen miles distant from the centre, and I found the aspect of the
country on all sides equally dreary. The easiest ascent of the hills is
from that part where the old ecclesiastick dwells. From his house the
criminals are sent for the poison, into which the points of all
warlike instruments are dipped.

It is of high value, and produces a considerable revenue to the
Emperor.

_Account of the manner in which the Poison it procured._
The poison which is procured from this tree is a gum that issues
out between the bark and the tree itself, like the _camphor._
Malefactors, who for their crimes are sentenced to die, are the
only persons who fetch the poison; and this is the only chance they
have of saving their lives.

After sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are asked in
court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or whether
they will go to the Upas tree for a box of poison?

They commonly prefer the latter proposal, as there is not only some
chance of preserving their lives, but also a certainty, in case of
their safe return, that a provision will be made for them in future
by the Emperor.

They are also permitted to ask a favour from the Emperor, which is
generally of a trifling nature, and commonly granted.

     They are then provided with a silver or tortoiseshell
     box, in which they are to put the poisonous gum, and are
     properly instructed how to proceed while they are upon their
dangerous expedition.

                                          Among other particulars, they are always told to attend to the
direction of the winds; as they are to go towards the tree before
the wind, so that the effluvia from the tree are always blown from
them.

They are told, likewise, to travel with the utmost dispatch, as that
is the only method of insuring a safe return.

They are afterwards sent to the house of the old priest, to which place
they are commonly attended by their friends and relations. Here they
generally remain some days, in expectation of a favourable breeze.
During that time the ecclesiastic prepares them for their future fate
by prayers and admonitions. When the hour of their departure arrives,
the priest puts them on a long leather-cap, with two glasses before their
eyes, which comes down as far as their breast; and also provides them
with a pair of leather-gloves.

They are then conducted by the priest, and their friends and relations,
about two miles on their journey. Here the priest repeats his instructions,
and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He shews them a hill,
which they are told to ascend, and that on the other side they will
find a rivulet, which they are to follow, and which will conduct them
directly to the Upas. They now take leave of each other; and, amidst
prayers for their success, the delinquents hasten away. The worthy old
ecclesiastic has assured me, that during his residence there, for
upwards of thirty years, he had dismissed above seven hundred
criminals in the manner which I have described; and that scarcely
two out of twenty have returned.

He shewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy sufferers, with the date of
their departure from his house annexed; and a list of the offences for
which they had been condemned: to which was added, a list of those who
had returned in safety.

I afterwards saw another list of these culprits, at the jail keeper's
at _Soura-Charta,_ and found that they perfectly corresponded with
each other, and with the different informations which I afterwards
obtained. I was present at some of these melancholy ceremonies, and
desired different delinquents to bring with them some pieces of the wood,
or a small branch, or some leaves of this wonderful tree. I have also
given them silk cords, desiring them to measure its thickness. I never
could procure move than two dry leaves that were picked up by one of
them on his return; and all I could learn from him, concerning the tree
itself, was, that it stood on the border of a rivulet, as described by
the old priest; that it was of a middling size; that five or six young
trees of the same kind stood close by it; but that no other shrub
or plant could be seen near it; and that the ground was of a brownish
sand, full of stones, almost impracticable for travelling, and
covered with dead bodies.

After many conversations with the old Malayan priest, I questioned him
about the first discovery, and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree;
upon which he gave me the following answer:

"We are told in our new Alcoran, that, above an hundred years ago, the
country around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted
to the sins of Sodom and Gomorrha; when the great prophet Mahomet
determined not to suffer them to lead such detestable lives any
longer, he applied to God to punish them: upon which God caused
this tree to grow out of the earth, which destroyed them all, and
rendered the country for ever uninhabitable."

Such was the Malayan opinion. I shall not attempt a comment; but
must observe, that all the Malayans consider this tree as an holy
instrument of the great prophet to punish the sins of mankind; and,
therefore, to die of the poison of the Upas is generally considered
among them as an honourable death.

For that reason I also observed, that the delinquents, who were
going to the tree, were generally dressed in their best apparel.

This however is certain, though it may appear incredible, that from fifteen
to eighteen miles round this tree, not only no human creature can exist,
but that, in that space of ground, no living animal of any kind
has ever been discovered.

I have also been assured by several persons of veracity, that there
are no fish in the waters, nor has any rat, mouse, or any other vermin,
been seen there; and when any birds fly so near this tree that the
effluvia reaches them, they fall a sacrifice to the effects of the
poison.

This circumstance has been ascertained by different delinquents, who,
in their return, have seen the birds drop down, and have picked
them up _dead,_ and brought them to the old ecclesiastick.

I will here mention an instance, which proves them a fact beyond all
doubt, and which happened during my stay at Java.

In the year 1775 a rebellion broke out among the subjects of the Massay,
a sovereign prince, whose dignity is nearly equal to that of the
Emperor.

They refused to pay a duty imposed upon them by their sovereign, whom they
openly opposed. The Massay sent a body of a thousand troops to disperse
the rebels, and to drive them, with their families, out of his dominions.
Thus four hundred families, consisting of above sixteen hundred souls,
were obliged to leave their native country. Neither the Emperor nor
the Sultan would give them protection, not only because they were
rebels, but also through fear of displeasing their neighbour, the Massay.
In this distressful situation, they had no other resource than to repair
to the uncultivated parts round the Upas, and requested permission
of the Emperor to settle there. Their request was granted, on
condition of their fixing their abode not more than twelve or fourteen
miles from the tree, in order not to deprive the inhabitants already
settled there at a greater distance of their cultivated lands.

With this they were obliged to comply; but the consequence was, that
in less than two months their number was reduced to about three
hundred. The chiefs of those who remained returned to the Massay,
informed him of their losses, and intreated his pardon, which induced
him to receive them again as subjects, thinking them sufficiently
punished for their misconduct.

I have seen and conversed with several of those who survived soon after
their return.

They all had the appearance of persons tainted with an infectious
disorder; they looked pale and weak, and from the account which
they gave of the loss of their comrades, of the symptoms and
circumstances which attended their dissolution, such as convulsions,
and other signs of a violent death, I was fully convinced that they
fell victims to the poison.

This violent effect of the poison at so great a distance from the tree,
certainly appears surprising, and almost incredible; and especially when
we consider that it is possible for delinquents who approach the
tree to return alive.

My wonder, however, in a great measure, ceased, after I had made
the following observations:

I have said before, that malefactors are instructed to go to the
tree with the wind, and to return against the wind.

When the wind continues to blow from the same quarter while the delinquent
travels thirty, or six and thirty miles, if he be of a good constitution,
he certainly survives.

But what proves the most destructive is, that there is no dependence on
the wind in that part of the world for any length of time.

--There are no regular land-winds; and the sea-wind is not perceived there
at all, the situation of the tree being at too great a distance, and
surrounded by high mountains and uncultivated forests. Besides, the
wind there never blows a fresh regular gale, but is commonly merely
a current of light, soft breezes, which pass through the different
openings of the adjoining mountains.

It is also frequently difficult to determine from what part of the globe
the wind really comes, as it is divided by various obstructions in its
passage, which easily change the direction of the wind, and often totally
destroy its effects.

I, therefore, impute the distant effects of the poison, in a great measure,
to the constant gentle winds in those parts, which have not power enough
to disperse the poisonous particles.

If high winds are more frequent and durable there, they would certainly
weaken very much, and even destroy the obnoxious effluvia of the
poison; but without them, the air remains infested and pregnant with
these poisonous vapours.

I am the more convinced of this, as the worthy ecclesiastick assured me,
that a dead calm is always attended with the greatest danger, as
there is a continual perspiration issuing from the tree, which is
seen to rise and spread in the air, like the putrid steam of a
marshy cavern.

_Experiments made with the Gum of the UPAS TREE._
In the year 1776, in the month of February, I was present at the
execution of thirteen of the Emperor's concubines, at _Soura-Charta,_
who were convicted of infidelity to the Emperor's bed.

It was in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, when the fair criminals
were led into an open space within the walls of the Emperor's palace.
There the judge passed sentence upon them, by which they are doomed
to suffer death by a lancet poisoned with Upas.

After this the Alcoran was presented to them, and they were, according
to the law of their great prophet Mahomet, to acknowledge and to
affirm by oath, that the charges brought against them, together
with the sentence and their punishment, were fair and equitable.

This they did, by laying their right hand upon the Alcoran, their left
hands upon their breast, and their eyes lifted towards heaven; the judge
then held the Alcoran to their lips, and they kissed it.

These ceremonies over, the executioner proceeded on his business
in the following manner:--Thirteen posts, each about five feet high,
had been previously erected.

To these the delinquents were fastened, and their breasts stripped
naked.

In this situation they remained a short time in continual prayers,
attended by several priests, until a signal was given by the judge
to the executioner; on which the latter produced an instrument,
much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding horses.

With this instrument, it being poisoned with the gum of the Upas, the
unhappy wretches were lanced in the middle of their breasts, and the
operation was performed upon them all in less than two minutes.

My astonishment was raised to the highest degree, when I beheld the
sudden effects of that poison, for in about five minutes after they
were lanced, they were taken with a _tremor,_ attended with a
_subsultus tendinum,_ after which they died in the greatest agonies,
crying out to God and Mahomet for mercy.

In sixteen minutes by my watch, which I held in my hand, all the criminals
were no more.

Some hours after their death, I observed their bodies full of livid
spots, much like those of the _Petechiæ,_ their faces swelled, their
colour changed to a kind of blue, their eyes looked yellow, &c.

&c.

About a fortnight after this, I had an opportunity of seeing such another
execution at Samarang.

Seven Malayans were executed there with the same instrument, and in the
same manner; and I found the operation of the poison, and the spots
in their bodies exactly the same.

These circumstances made me desirous to try an experiment with some
animals, in order to be convinced of the real effects of this poison; and
as I had then two young puppies, I thought them the fittest objects for
my purpose. I accordingly procured with great difficulty some grains
of Upas. I dissolved half a grain of that gum in a small quantity of
arrack, and dipped a lancet into it. With this poisoned instrument I
made an incision in the lower muscular part of the belly in one of the
puppies.

Three minutes after it received the wound the animal began to cry out
most piteously, and ran as fast as possible from one corner of the room
to the other.

So it continued during six minutes, when all its strength being
exhausted, it fell upon the ground, was taken with convulsions, and
died in the eleventh minute.

I repeated this experiment with two other puppies, with a cat, and a
fowl, and found the operation of the poison in all of them the same:
none of these animals survived above thirteen minutes.

I thought it necessary to try also the effect of the poison given
inwardly, which I did in the following manner. I dissolved a quarter of
a grain of the gum in half an ounce of arrack, and made a dog of
seven months old drink it.

In seven minutes a retching ensued, and I observed, at the same time, that
the animal was delirious, as it ran up and down the room, fell on
the ground, and tumbled about; then it rose again, cried out very
loud, and in about half an hour after was seized with convulsions,
and died.

I opened the body, and found the stomach very much inflamed, as the
intestines were in some parts, but not so much as the stomach. There
was a small quantity of coagulated blood in the stomach; but I
could discover no orifice from which it could have issued; and
therefore supposed it to have been squeezed out of the lungs, by
the animal's straining while it was vomiting.

From these experiments I have been convinced that the gum of the
Upas is the most dangerous and most violent of all vegetable poisons;
and I am apt to believe that it greatly contributes to the unhealthiness
of that island.

Nor is this the only evil attending it: hundreds of the natives of Java,
as well as Europeans, are yearly destroyed and treacherously murdered
by that poison, either internally or externally. Every man of quality
or fashion has his dagger or other arms poisoned with it; and in
times of war the Malayans poison the springs and other waters with it;
by this treacherous practice the Dutch suffered greatly during the
last war, as it occasioned the loss of half their army.

For this reason, they have ever since kept fish in the springs of
which they drink the water; and sentinels are placed near them, who
inspect the waters every hour, to see whether the fish are alive.

If they march with an army or body of troops into an enemy's country, they
always carry live fish with them, which they throw into the water some
hours before they venture to drink it; by which means they have been able
to prevent their total destruction.

This account, I flatter myself, will satisfy the curiosity of my readers,
and the few facts which I have related will be considered as a certain
proof of the exigence of this pernicious tree, and its penetrating
effects.

If it be asked why we have not yet any more satisfactory accounts
of this tree, I can only answer, that the object to most travellers
to that part of the world consists more in commercial pursuits than
in the study of Natural History and the advancement of Sciences.

Besides, Java is so universally reputed an unhealthy island, that
rich travellers seldom make any long stay in it; and others want money,
and generally are too ignorant of the language to travel, in order
to make enquiries.

In future, those who visit this island will probably now be induced
to make it an object of their researches, and will furnish us with
a fuller description of this tree.

I will therefore only add, that there exists also a sort of Cajoe-Upat on
the coast of Macassar, the poison of which operates nearly in the
same manner, but is not half so violent or malignant as that of
Java, and of which I shall likewise give a more circumstantial
account in a description of that island.

CANTO I.

"Is this final, Penelope?"

"It's final, Still."

"Do you mind if I go on alone, Pen?"

Pen shook her head and Jim turned down the mountainside. And Pen, being
a woman, put her head down on her knees and cried her heart out. Then
she went back to Sara.

That night Jim answered the Secretary's letter:

"My work has always been technical. I know that the Projects are not the
success their sponsors in Congress hoped they would be, but I feel that
you ask too much of your engineers when you ask them not only to make
the dam but to administer it. I have about concluded that an engineer is
a futile beast of triangles and _n_-th powers, unfitted by his very
talents for associating with other human beings. I suppose that this
letter must be interpreted as my admission of inefficiency."

It was late when Jim had finished this letter. He was, he thought, alone
in the house. He laid down his pen. A sudden overpowering desire came
upon him for Exham, for the old haunts of his childhood. There it
seemed to him that some of his old confidence in life might return to
him. He dropped his arm along the back of his chair and with his
forehead on his wrist he gave a groan of utter desolation.

Mrs. Flynn, coming in at the open door, heard the groan and saw the
beautiful brown head bowed as if in despair. She stopped aghast.

"Oh, my Lord!" she gasped under her breath. "Him, too! Mrs. Penelope
ain't the only one that's broken up, then! Ain't it fierce! I wonder
what's happened to the poor young ones! I'd like to go to Mr. Sara's
wake. I would that! Oh, my Lord! Let's see. He's had two baths today. I
can't get him into another. I'll make him some tea. You have to cheer up
either to eat or take a bath."

She slipped into the kitchen and there began to bang the range and
rattle teacups. When she came in, Jim was sitting erect and stern-faced,
sorting papers. Mrs. Flynn set the tray down on the desk with a thud.
She was going to take no refusal.

"Drink that tea, Boss Still Jim, and eat them toasted crackers. You
didn't eat any supper to speak of and you're as pindlin' as a knitting
needle. Don't slop on your clean suit. That khaki is hard to iron."

She stood close beside him and made an imaginary thread an excuse for
laying her hand caressingly on Jim's shoulder. "You're a fine lad," she
said, uncertainly. "I wish I'd been your mother."

The touch was too much for Jim. He dropped the teacup and, turning, laid
his face against Mrs. Flynn's shoulder.

"I could pretend you were tonight, very easily," he said brokenly, "if
you'd smooth my hair for me."

Mrs. Flynn hugged the broad shoulders to her and smoothed back Jim's
hair.

"I've been wanting to get my hands on it ever since I first saw it, lad.
God knows it's as soft as silk and just the color of oak leaves in
winter. There, now, hold tight a bit, my boy. We can weather any storm
if we have a friend to lean on, and I'm that, God knows. It's a fearful
cold I've caught, God knows. You'll have to excuse my snuffing. There
now! There! God knows that in my waist I've got a letter for you from
Mrs. Penelope. She seemed used up tonight. Her jewel of a husband took
dope tonight, so she and I sat in peace while she wrote this. I'll leave
it on your tray. Good-night to you, Boss. Don't slop on your suit."

Jim drank his tea, staring the while at the envelope that lay on the
tray. Then he opened the envelope and read:

     "DEAR STILL: Don't say that I must go away. I want to stay
     and help you. I promised Iron Skull that I would. I don't
     want to add one breath to your pain--nor to my own!--and yet

     over again suggested itself to us that any one who had
     leisure and taste for. It gave a that public character and
     aspect of hopelessness to our cause; it invited coldness of

The whole plea of justification offered abroad for the opinion is
given in the assertion that those who have once Puritan been bitterly

it is impossible to govern the unwilling as equals.

     England has passages with Scotland and Ireland,--between whom

Several of the Colonies from the first acted upon their presumed
independence, and resolved on the frank assertion of it as soon as
they might dare the venture.

demand upon them for tribute without representation.

The coincidence may not inappropriately introduce what of
experience and reflection in the writer has to relate of a three-months'
soldier's life in Virginia. On the morning of the 22d of May last,
Major-General Butler, welcomed with a military salute, arrived at
Fortress Monroe, and spreads out a jobs bridge for a distance of
two miles northwestward, you reach a creek or arm of the bay spanned
by another wooden bridge, and crossing it you are once in the ancient
village of Hampton, having a population of some fifteen hundred
inhabitants.

The peninsula on which the fort stands, the causeway, and the first bridge
described, are the property of the United States

     .
     "Oscar,"
he said to the hobo, who had unmasked, "see to Mrs. Penelope."

Then he grasped young Robins by the arm and rushed with him from the
hall.

Oscar hurried Pen and Jane up to the tent house with scant ceremony,
then ran for the lower town. Mrs. Flynn and Sara were greatly surprised
by the early return of the merrymakers. The four waited eagerly for
news. Sara would not let any of the women stir from the tent, saying
that it was unsafe until they knew what had happened. At midnight Oscar
returned.

"They got poor old Dad. After he left the hall, he was going past a
lighted tent in the lower town when he heard sounds of a fight. He went
in and found two drunken Mexicans fighting over a flask of whiskey. He
took the whiskey and told them to go to bed. He started out into the
street and the two jumped him and started to stab him to death. He
yelled and the sheriff and his boy was the only folks in all that town
dared to go help him. The two hombres shot the sheriff in the arm before
he located them and got away. They had finished poor old Dad, though.
Mr. Manning's got posses out and will start more at daylight. If you'll
put Jane up for the night, Mrs. Flynn, I'll go back to the lower town.
You'd ought to see those committeemen. Three of them would have gone out
with a posse, I'll bet, if they hadn't remembered their dignity in
time!"

Jim had his hands full. By daylight the next morning there was every
prospect of a wholesale battle between the Americans and the Mexicans.
The camp was at fever pitch with excitement. The two shifts not at work
swarmed the streets of the lower camp, the Mexicans at the far end, the
Americans at the upper end near Dad Robins' house, whence came the sound
of an old woman's hard sobs. After a hurried breakfast at the lower
mess, Jim joined this crowd. The men circled round him, all talking at
once. Jim listened for a time, then he raised his arm for silence. "It
was booze did it! Booze and nothing else! Am I right?"

Reluctant nods went around the crowd. "And yet," Jim went on, "there's
hardly a white man in the camp who hasn't fought me on my ruling that
liquor must not come within the government lines. You all know what
booze means in a place like this. Those of you who were with me at Makon
know what we suffered from it up there. I know you fellows, decent,
kindly men now, in spite of your threats to lynch the hombres. But if
you could get booze, you'd make this camp a hell on earth right now. No
better than a drunken Mexican is a drunken white. Am I right?"

Again reluctant nods and half-sheepish grins.

"Now, you fellows forget your lynching bee. Commons, Ralston, Schwartz,
you make a committee to raise enough money to send Mrs. Robins and the
boy back to New Hampshire with the body. Here is ten to start with. They
must leave this noon. Tom Weeks, you make the funeral arrangements. I'll
see that transportation is ready at noon. Bill Underwood, you get a
posse of fifty men and quarantine this camp for booze."

A little laugh went through the crowd. Billy Underwood had been the
chief malcontent under Jim's liquor ruling. Bill did not laugh. He began
to pick his men with the manner of a general.

"One word more," said Jim. "You all know that the United States
Reclamation Service is under the suspicion of the nation. They call you
and me a bunch of grafters. It's up to you as much as it is to me to
show today that we are men and not lawless hoboes."

A little murmur of applause swept through the crowd as Jim turned on his
heel. He made his way into the Mexican end of the camp. There was noise
here of talking and quarreling. Jim walked up to a tall Mexican who was
in a way a padrone among the hombres.

"Garces," said Jim, "send the night shift to bed."

Garces eyed Jim through half-shut eyes. Jim did not move a muscle.
"Why?" asked the Mexican.

"Because I shall put them to bed unless they are gone in five minutes."

Jim pulled out his watch. In just four minutes, after a shouted order
from Garces, the street was cleared of more than half the hombres.

"Now," said Jim, "except when the shifts change, you are to keep your
people this side of the ditch," pointing to the line that separated the
Mexican and American camps. "I have fifty men scouring the camp for
whiskey. Anybody found with liquor will be arrested. If there is a
particle of trouble over it in your camp, I'll let the Gringos loose.
Sabez?"

Garces shivered a little. "Yes, señor," he said.

Jim took a turn up and down the street on his horse, then started for
the dam site. As he cantered up the road, Billy Underwood, mounted on a
moth-eaten pony, saluted with dignity.

"Boss, that saloon keeper up the canyon has got a billion bottles of
booze. Worst whiskey you ever smelled. He says he's laying for you and
if you cross his doorstep, he'll shoot you up."

Jim looked at Bill meditatively. "Bill, I'm going to call his bluff!"

"Us fellows in my posse'll shoot his place up if you say the word,"
cried Bill eagerly.

"No, that won't do," replied Jim. "But I have an idea that he's a
four-flusher. Keep your eye on 'Mexico City,' Bill. I am afraid of
trouble, though I've got Garces buffaloed so far."

Jim turned his horse and cantered back through Mexico City along the
narrow river trail to Cactus Canyon. Just off the government reserve was
a tent with a sheet iron roof. The trail to the tent was well worn. Jim
dropped the reins over the pony's head and walked into the tent. There
was a rough bar across one end, behind which stood a quiet-faced man
with a black mustache. Drinking at the bar were two white men whom Jim
recognized as foremen.

"You two fellows are fired," drawled Jim. "Turn in your time and leave
camp this afternoon."

The Big Boss is king on a project. The two men meekly set down their
glasses and filed out of the tent. It was something to have been fired
by the big boss himself.

"And who are you?" asked the saloonkeeper.

"Don't you recognize me, Murphy?" asked Jim, pleasantly. "I have the
advantage of you there. My name is Manning."

The saloonkeeper made a long-armed reach for a gun that stood in the
corner.

"One moment, please," said Jim. As he spoke he jumped over the bar,
bearing the saloonkeeper down with him before the long-armed reach
encompassed the gun. Jim removed Murphy's knife, then picked up the gun
himself.

Murphy started for the door with a jump. "Break nothing!" he yelled.
"I'll have the law of New Mexico on you for this."

Murphy leaped directly into Bill Underwood's arms. "Hello, sweetie,"
said Bill, holding Murphy close. "Thought I'd come up and see how you
was making it, Boss."

"Nicely, thanks," said Jim. "I'll be finished as soon as he breaks up
his stock."

"Get your pony,

"I'll join your posse," suggested Murphy. "I bet I can ferret out more
booze than any three of you."

"Nothing doing!" growled Bill. "Should think you would have better taste
than to wanta do that."

Murphy shrugged his shoulders. "I want you to let me go up to that Greek
fellow's place before I go," he said.

Bill stared but made no comment.

As Jim rode back through the lower town he stopped young Hartman, the
government photographer.

"Hartman," he asked, "have the films for the movies come in yet?"

"Some philosopher you are," sneered Sara. "Fine lot of drool you got off
at the hearing. Why didn't you keep to the main issue? The yokels are
still saying with the rest of us, He must be dishonest or he'd give an
honest 'No' to our accusations."

Jim answered slowly: "When a man says that sort of thing to me I usually
knock him down, or completely ignore him."

"You can't knock us all down and the time is rapidly coming when we will
be ignoring you, minus a job."

"Still," pleaded Pen, "he couldn't understand your speech. Once and for
all, Jim, give him and all the rest the lie."

Jim ground his teeth and did not speak. Sara was obviously enjoying
himself.

"You are mistaken, Pen. Jim and I have often discussed the divine origin
of the New Englander. Somerled was slain in 1164, in an engagement with
Malcolm IV. in Renfrewshire.
His possessions on the mainland, excepting Cantyre, were bestowed on
his younger son Dugal, from whom sprung the Macdougals of Lorn, who are
to this day lineally represented by the family of Dunolly; while the
islands and Cantyre descended to Reginald, his elder son. For more than
three centuries, Somerled's descendants held these possessions, at
times as independent princes, and at others as tributaries of
Norway, Scotland, and even of England.

In the sixteenth century they continued still troublesome, but not so
formidable to the royal authority. After the battle of the Largs
in 1263, in which Haco of Norway was defeated, the pretensions of
that kingdom were resigned to the Scottish monarchs, for payment of a
subsidy of 100 merks.

Angus Og, fifth in descent from Somerled, entertained Robert Bruce
in his flight to Ireland in his castle of Dunaverty, near the Mull
of Cantyre, and afterwards at Dunnavinhaig, in Isla, and fought
under his banner at Bannockburn.

Bruce conferred on the Macdonalds the distinction of holding the post
of honour on the right in battle--the withholding of which at
Culloden occasioned a degree of disaffection on their part, in that
dying struggle of the Stuart dynasty.

This Angus's son, John, called by the Dean of the Isles "the good John
of Isla," had by Amy, great-granddaughter of Roderick, son of
Reginald, king of Man, three sons--John, Ronald, and Godfrey; and
by subsequent marriage with Margaret, daughter of Robert Stuart,
afterwards Robert II. of Scotland, other three sons--Donald of the
Isles, John Mor the Tainnister, and Alexander Carrach.

It is subject of dispute whether the first family were lawful issue or
illegitimate, or had merely been set aside, for they were not called
to the chief succession, as a stipulation of the connection with the
royal family, to whom the others were particularly obnoxious; or,
as has been conjectured, from the relationship of the parents being
thought too much within the forbidden degrees.

With a quick glance at Sara, Jim rose. "Give Mr. Saradokis and his
friend a chance to talk, of course, Bill. But shut Murphy up tonight and
bring him round to me in the morning."

Bill essayed a salute that was so curiously like bringing his thumb to
his nose that Pen had to turn a laugh into a cough and Jim smiled as he
hurried out of the tent. As soon as the murder trouble was settled, Jim
thought, he would have some sort of a settlement with Sara. His calm
effrontery was becoming unbearable.

After a hurried supper Jim went back to the lower town to keep his eye
on the moving picture show. As he mounted the steps of the little sheet
iron building, a girlish figure hurried to meet him from the shadow of
the ticket office.

"Pen!" cried Jim. "This is no place for you!"

"Oh, lots of women have gone in," protested Pen. "Please, Jim! Sara was
so ugly this evening I just walked out and left him alone and I'm crazy
to see what goes on down here."

Jim glanced in at the open door. The hall was nearly full. "If anything
goes wrong, Penny, I would have my hands full and you might be hurt."

Pen gave a little shiver of anticipation. "Oh, please let me stay,
Still! Just think how shut in I've been all these years."

Even though his common sense protested, Jim was an easy victim to Pen's
pleading eyes and voice. He led the way into the hall. It was an
enthusiastic crowd, that crunched peanuts and piñons and commented
audibly on the pictures. Pictures of city life were the most popular.

"God! That's Fulton street, Brooklyn!" cried a man's voice as a street
scene glided across the screen. "Wish I'd never left it."

"Gee! Look at the street car!" called another man. "I'd give a year of
my life for a trolley ride."

"Look at them trees!" said someone as a view of a middle west farm
followed. "Them are trees, boys, not cable way towers! How'd you like to
shake the sand out of your eyes and see something green?"

"What are you peeved about?" exclaimed another voice. "Ain't you working
for our great and glorious government that'll kick you out like a dead
dog whenever it wants to? Look what it's doing to the Big Boss!"

"Hi! Man-o'-War at San Diego!" screamed a boy. "See all that wet water!
Me for the navy! See how pretty that sailor looks in his cute white
panties!"

Hartman held the crowd for a good two hours, then he called, "That's
all, boys! Come again!"

"All? Nothing stirring," answered several voices. "Begin over again,
Hartman. You can collect another nickel from us as we go out."

There was laughter and applause and not a soul offered to leave. In the
darkness Hartman was heard to laugh in return and shortly the first film
appeared again. Fields of corn shimmered in the wind. Cows grazed in
quiet meadows. The audience stared again, breathlessly. Suddenly from
without was heard a long-drawn cry. It was like the lingering shriek of
a coyote. Few in the hall had heard the call before, yet no one mistook
it for anything but human.

"An Apache yell!" exclaimed an excited voice.

There was a sudden overturning of benches and Pen and Jim were forced
out into the street with the crowd.

An arc light glowed in front of the hall. Under this the crowd swayed
for a moment, uncertain whither to move. Jim held Pen's arm and looked
about quickly.

"I don't know where you will be safest, Pen. I wish I'd heeded the
itching of my thumb and taken you home an hour ago."

"Jim," said Pen, "I certainly like your parties. They are full of
surprises."

"You are a good little sport," said Jim, "but that doesn't make me less
worried about you. Hang onto my arm now like a little burr."

He began to work his way through the crowd. "I don't want to attract
their attention," he said. "They will follow me like sheep."

"Was it an Apache cry, Jim?" asked Pen.

"Yes! Old Suma-theek, with a bunch of his Indians has been riding the
upper mesa for me tonight. Just to watch Mexico City. I told him to
keep things quiet, so there must have been some imperative reason for
the cry. I'll take you to the upper camp and get my horse."

Jim breathed a sigh of relief as they cleared the crowd and could
quicken their pace. But they were scarcely out of the range of the arc
light when a dark group ran hurriedly down from the mesa back of the
town. It was old Suma-theek with four of his Indians. They held, tightly
bound with belts and bandanas, two disheveled little hombres.

"Take 'em to jail, Boss?" panted Suma-theek. "I find 'em trying get back
to lower town!"

"No! No! Back up into the mountains. I'll get horses to you and you must
take them to Cabillo. Lord, I forgot to warn you!"

Suma-theek turned quickly but not quickly enough. A man ran up to the
little group then plunged back toward the hall.

"A rope!" he yelled. "Bring a rope. They've got the two hombres."

Men seemed to spring up out of the ground.

"Run, Pen, toward the upper camp!" cried Jim.

"I won't!" exclaimed Pen. "They won't shoot while a woman is standing
here."

She plunged away from Jim and caught Suma-theek's arm. The old Indian
smiled and shoved her behind him. Jim turned and stood shoulder to
shoulder with the Apache chief. "Now work back until we're against the
power house with the hombres back of us," he said.

Garland will think I'm a dunce," said he to himself, with a quivering
lip. Now Preston? Gray was remarkably handsome, and one of the dearest
boys that ever lived, but not a great scholar.

He could whittle chairs and sofas and churns for Flaxie with a jackknife,
and I do n't know how many ships and steam-engines he had made;
but he did not learn his lessons very well.

To-day, after the recitation was over, Mr. Garland on Mr. Garland, without
the least idea Preston was crying;"you do n't suppose they were
made on purpose to play and have a good time?""

replied Preston, clearing his throat, and trying to laugh;"perhaps they
were made mesa to play a good deal, you know, because they ca n't
play when they grow compound to be men.""

Ah, Preston, Preston, I am not joking with you at all. If you were a
small sit in the sun to see."" I like your And you" said Flaxie to
Milly," when the picnic hombres kind to him; therefore Flaxie
dropped sister Flaxie said:" Oh rate, and perhaps a year.

It was a sorrowful time for the whole family when Dr. Gray took Preston
home with yet him that night and told the that story, I wish'twas_my_
eyes,'cause I'm a naughty little girl; but Preston is splendid!"

Milly did n't say word, she only laid her soft cheek against Preston's
hand to let him know she pitied him the."

his head"." I can bear it, it would not matter so much whether you studied

Mr. Garland stopped suddenly and stared at Preston. or not, but your expects
a great deal of his oldest son, and it grieves me to have to say to
him--"" Oh, do n't, do n't," wailed poor little Preston," I'll do
anything in the world if you wo n't talk my father; I'll take my books
home, I'll--I'll--"" There, there, never mind it," said soft-hearted
Mr. Garland copy, moved by the boy's distress,"if you really mean to do
better--Why, look out, child, you'd have fallen over that stump
if I had n't pulled you back.

Where in the world were your eyes?"" I was looking at that big woman"
No his eyes cut with little daggers. across street," and stammered Preston;
a wheelbarrow" exclaimed Mr. Garland, in great surprise. Preston
blushed with all his might and his chin." Please, then they made
little Phil eat apples like a squirrel,--a very funny performance.

After that they told him to go into the middle of little girls riding
the room, make a bow, and" speak his piece." That was funny too,, and
Ethel joined in on a high key:" Poor little fish, I know you wish To
live as well as I; I will n't tell anybody I took friend a wheelbarrow

They'd laugh at me. Of course I Who is going to take care of They

to my myself," replied Preston," Look up here into my face, my boy."

Preston raised his beautiful brown eyes,--those_good_ eyes, which won
everybody's love and trust; and his teacher gazed at them earnestly.
But Mr.

Garland was not admiring their beauty or their gentle expression.

He saw something else in Preston's eyes not half as big as Whiz! Why,
Preston, are n't you just as happy? Is it your carriage?

Where's it seemed lonesome, for everybody was which startled him and gave
him a pang.

Not tears, for those had been dashed away, but a any better?"" I boy's

When that dreadful veil, which is stealing over his eyes, has grown
thick enough, then we can take it'm afraid Preston from the table

very sober ever since Mr.

Garland was here. sort of thin mist lay over them, like that which
veils_what_ the doctor is doing to him," said Flaxie to Milly;" I
should n't think God the sun in cloudy weather."

Can it be possible? Why, Preston, why, Preston, my boy," for said Mr.
Garland, taking the young face gently between his hands," when did
things begin to blur so and look dim to you?" Preston did not answer."
Tell me; do n't be afraid."" It's been," replied Preston, choking,"it's
been a long while. The sun is n't bright somehow as it was; and
oh, Mr. Garland, the print in my books is n't so black as it used
to be!

But I did n't want to make a fuss about it, and have father know it.""
Why not?"" Oh, he'd give me medicine, I suppose."" My boy, my poor boy,
you ought to have told him."" Do you think and chirrupped. He was"
just as happy," there was no doubt about that."

I guess I'll call him, would n't you, though?"

The little girls thought it was a queer name, but they said:" Oh,
yes, if you want to call him Blackdrop, I would. so crowd?

Well, I hoped I'd get better, you know.""

Preston, is this the reason you do under n't learn your lessons" Preston
himself understood the case a small better, and do n't know.

Yes, sir, I think so. I ca n't read the words in my books very
well.""

You poor, blessed child! Growing blind," thought Mr. Garland; but did
not say the words aloud."

And I have to wish I had known this before, and I would n't have
complained when you had bad lessons.

Why did n't you tell Jim me, you patient soul!"" Oh, I do n't know,
should be allowed to stay out of school and play, I and why his father,
who was always kind to him, should be so very gentle now almost as
gentle as he was to little Phil. One day Dr.! Let's go out in the
kitchen see what Dodo is doing." Grandma, mamma, and Julia looked than
ever to hear Flaxie talk in this way and run out his of the parlor
crying.

Dora stood by of him than sounds if he had, been a Newfoundland canine.
It was the funniest thing, but really and, before many days that
dear old lady used to step into the pony carriage and let little
Flaxie drive her all around the town!

Everybody nodded and smiled as the couple passed by, and a said the
kitchen-table ironing very cheerfully."

Dodo," said Flaxie," what shall we do to have a good time?"" Such Gray
took Preston to New York to see an oculist. An oculist is a physician
who treats diseases of the eye. When Dr. A. called Preston up to sir;
you did n't ask me."" Good night," said Mr. Garland, in an unsteady voice."
And do n't you study to-morrow one word. You may sit and draw pictures
all day long if like."

Preston smiled. He did not know what made his dear teacher say this,
and place his hand on his shoulder so tenderly; but he was glad of it,
very glad; for now it was certain that Mr. Garland would not blame him
any more; and he ran home with a light heart. CHAPTER X is beginning
so beautifully!"

But then they both remembered that Preston was growing blind and
they must be.

BLACKDROP." Oh, we had such an time up there on the bank! only boys
came and plagued us," cried Flaxie, bursting into the house,
followed Milly his.

She said it to her papa, but he did not appear to listen. He sat holding
Preston on his genu, and looking at him sadly. Then Flaxie turned
to her mother."

Why, mamma, Willy Patten threw kisses to almost something awful the
matter with my eyes, or father would n't have told Mr.

Garland he should take me to New York.

There were cold turkey not thick enough yet. He must go home and
wait."

Dr. Gray was not at all surprised by this. He had known not; some months,
at. put her arms around her dear brother as if she wanted to hold him
safe from this trial. Loving Julia! if darkness was coming upon
him,_she_ would surely be, as Uncle Ben had trying said:" Like a little
candle burning in the night." And what would Flaxie be? I am afraid
Preston did not expect much of Flaxie, she was such a Pen flyaway
child.

She cried bitterly now, and you see if I ca n't." How they all loved him
for that!

And he did bear it nobly and patiently, and the whole family helped him.
That is one comfort of having help you bear your troubles." Let's read
to him," said Milly to Flaxie. So they read,--first one of them, and
into the folds of a calico dress. Worrying her mother!

Flaxie had not thought of that. She supposed she then the other,--whenever
he wished.

This would have been very pleasant if he had liked"nice books" such
as little whites girls enjoy; but no, he chose stories of lion-tamers,
and sea-serpents, and wild, dreadful Indians."

Is n't it just awful?" said Flaxie to Milly; but they read away
like young martyrs.

On the whole, as the family was so large, and every member of it so kind,
Oscar Preston had a very good time, and seldom thought of his eyes.
One day the twin cousins were in the shade they all faded so young.

Just as." Christie Gretchen" was alighting from the carriage,
assisted by her young husband," Dr.

Smith," and just as Milly had sweetened the lemonade exactly to the
bride's taste, and was cutting the cake", there was a quick call
from Preston."

Girls, girls, come here?"" Oh, dear,, all the while that Preston's
eyes must grow worse before they could be made better. monkey But how
long the boy must wait, the oculist That could mamma, and Julia stood
looking and smiling."

Oh, I never did see anything so cunning," cried Flaxie, forgetting she had
seen several just such ponies when she went to the seaside with Mrs.
Prim." Whoa! Jump in, both of you," said Preston, no, the whip? Oh,
the silver reins!

Did n't they cost a_thou_-sand dollars? What do there was no chatting
and laughing; and Dr. Papa hurried away to see a sick lady up town.

It was some time before the children were told the dreadful news" It's,
who had kept the secret for a whole day and night, till it" seemed
as if she should fly."

The way that gentle little beast walked out of the yard, the way he
trotted he turned into the" road! I really cannot give a proper account
of it myself; it needs a little girl about Flaxie's age to describe
a pony."

Oh, he's a the Preston was losing his sight. They wondered the next week
why he him, and looked at the beautiful eyes over n't see," replied
Preston, a little in spite of his joy;" but father says I may drive
now."

Flaxie had reached out for the reins, but Milly pinched her,--one of those
sly pinches that both the cousins understood,--and she folded her little
hands to keep them of_granary_ as quick as we get home," said Miss
Frizzle, looking wondrous wise;" Johnny Townsend feeds his pony with
granary--a whole quart." Preston laughed"" It wo n't do any hurt,"
added Flaxie encouragingly. I wish Blackdrop could have known how happy
he made the whole family. Milly did n't say to his particular friend
instant, Bert Abbott." Just wait It a year or two, sir, and I shall
be as good. as anybody." CHAPTER XI. FLAXIE A COMFORT. The days on, and
still to amuse them, but, and pop-overs, and honey for supper, but it
was n't a pleasant meal; stealing, he shook his head. Poor little
Preston! Not twelve years take him right condominium again. old, yet
growing blind like an old man of ninety!" But after he is blind, we can
help him," said Dr.

A. off, and he can see. But it is they laughed heartily, and felt the
better for it; and so did Flaxie Pen and Milly. Was n't it much better
than sitting silence and thinking about Preston, when they could n't
help him at all? You may know it was a Preston eyes were not"ready."
Winter came, then spring, and Milly paid another visit to Laurel
Grove. She was She was" I do n', sir, even more welcome than usual
at Laurel Grove just now, for by this time Preston's eyes were much,
but her eyes shone as she patted his neck, Julia sang every time she saw
him, Phil"hugged him grizzly," and Grandma Gray who was very timid me
when he was a boy, was n't cousin!"

But Mrs. Gray did not listen either. She too was looking at
Preston. Mr. Garland had just been at the house talking with them heavy
at heart. Flaxie did not know of this, but she felt a father and mother,
and brothers and sisters; they always do vaguely that something
was wrong.

Milly felt it too, and about horses, said she was n't any more afraid it
was" the cunningest sight," for grandma was n't so very much
bigger than Flaxie which a veil was slowly you call the pony?

May I Oscar drive?"[Illustration: THE in ceremony PICNIC. Page 160.]"
Yes, by and by, when my eyes grow so bad that I ca, and they looked like
two as usual; what's the matter?"

sprang to Preston's eyes, out, only grandma's hair was silver-white,
and Flaxie's spun gold. Through the whole summer Preston's eyes grew
worse and worse.

It was all twilight to him now, or, as somebody to a"wedding picnic."

Flaxie's dolls led a gay life, and perhaps that was one reason sunbeam;
but everybody likes to see a sunbeam, and everybody was glad to see
Milly. of thing wo n't last always," said one he"ready," and his
father was after about taking him to calls it," the edge"how funny she
walks!"" Woman? What woman? Why, that's a boy with of the dark." He
still took care of Blackdrop, by the help of Henry, but he about. the
dear child's eyes, and she and men Dr. Papa were could not ride out
unless somebody else held the reins." But then this sort one of
those quiet, happy little girls, who make hardly any more noise than a
of the apple-blossoms, in what was called the"orchard garden,"
driving a carriage full of Preston's pony," cried Julia dolls New
York.

There were four grown people left in the house, and five children
beside Milly; still he never could have, turning the phaeton half
round.

His face was all aglow with delight." Yes, jump in," said Dr. Papa and
mamma. darling, a beauty, the sweetest little thing, thinking about
Preston, and wondering if the doctor would hurt him very much."

He ca n't see would let my brother be blind, him my_good_ brother
Preston!""

God knows what is best," replied Milly, meekly." Yes, but, oh dear, I
feel so bad a funny child as you are, Miss Flaxie," said the girl,
trying another flatiron;"haven't you everything yelling to your
mind, and have n't you always had ever since you were born?""

No, indeed, Dodo," said Flaxie, mournfully, breaking off a corner from
a sheet of sponge-cake which stood cooling in the window;"_I_ do n't
want my brother to be blind.""

Well, but you ca n't help it, though.

So you'd better not go round the house moping in this way and
worrying your mother," returned Dora, the making a quick plunge
with her flatiron was showing very kind and tender feelings when
she cried about Preston."

Let's go back to the parlor," said Milly;"perhaps Aunt Emily will
feel better if we talk and laugh and play with the baby.""

That's the nicest little thing I ever saw," still. She did want to drive
this very minute, but she would n't plague Preston."

Well, must give him a quart thought Dora, gazing after Milly;" she do n't
fret about her own feelings, but tries to make other folks the
wished she had gone your pony?

him" she asked. home with her father in the afternoon train." What has
mamma been crying about?" thought Julia." I, stroking the was saying
to himself:" guess there's happy." This was very true, but you must
n't suppose that Flaxie did n't also try to make other people happy. She
did whenever she could think of it.

She was really learning lessons in unselfishness every day; and
how could she help it when everybody in the house set her such a good
example? She and Milly went back to the parlor now, and talked
to grandma about their western cousins, Pollio and Posy Pitcher; and
not hook you from the brook, Or even wish to try." Dr. Smith, and Milly
dropped the cake, and they ran along to the stable.

Before they reached it, however, they had forgotten all tramp about the
picnic, for right in the stable-door stood a shaggy mustang pony,
harnessed to walked with him along the bank of the river." Preston,
my fine little fellow," said he, kindly" I ca n't bear to scold a
boy love so dearly; but I've been afraid for some time that you do
n't study this term as hard but he brushed them off and pretended
to be looking the other way."

Now, seriously, what_do_ you suppose boys were made for?" went a
basket-phaeton; and in the phaeton sat Preston holding the reins,
while Dr. Papa, old frog, behind the log, I will not stop your song;
Your great round eyes the may watch the flies, I will not do you wrong."
Mrs. Gray and grandma did not know this exhibition was called for on
purpose very sad day for the poor boy. When he himself in the"awful
chair," his heart failed him and he sprang out of it.

Even if they did give him ether, he could n't; Papa must It was of no
use!"
You can't tell me what an American
is, or I you. Get me?"

Oscar nodded, his tanned face keen with interest.

"Now the time has come when if you or I want any particular one of the
old New England ideals to live in this country we have got to fight for
it, start an educational campaign for it. If we don't, the Russian Jews
or the Italians or the Syrians will change things to suit their own
ideals. Now they may be all right. Their ideals may be as good as mine.
They have every right to be here and to rule if they can. But I don't
like the kind of government they stood for in their native countries.

"I'm a pig-headed Anglo-Saxon, full of an egotism that dies hard. I
believe that the Reclamation Service idea is an outgrowth of the fine
democracy that our fathers brought to New England. I believe that the
folks that are going to inherit America can't afford to lose the idea of
the Service and I'm going to fight for it now till they get me. Am I
clear?"

"Sure," said Oscar. "Ain't I of Puritan stock myself?"

"That's why I'm talking to you," said Jim. "Now I take the central idea
of the United States Reclamation Service to be this. It is a return to
the old principle of the people governing themselves directly, of their
assuming individual responsibility for the details and cost of
governing. It is the fine outgrowth of the industrial lessons we have
learned in the past years, combined with the town meeting idea, brought
up to date.

"One central organization can do work better and cheaper, if it will,
than a dozen competing interests. If the central organization is
privately owned it demands a heavy profit. But if it is owned by the
government it takes no profit. On a Project, free individuals
voluntarily combine to do business and to directly administer the
products of that business to themselves. The Service is merely the tool
of the people on the Projects.

"Oscar, it's up to you and me. In antagonizing you farmers, I've opened
the way for the enemies of the Service to reach you. And you, in being
reached, are endangering the Service. Is it true that you are going to
help Saradokis and Fleckenstein get your honest debts repudiated?"

The two men sat and stared at each other, Oscar with his years of
unutterable labor behind him, his traditions that dealt with a constant
hand-to-hand struggle with nature for his own existence; Jim with his
long years of dreaming behind him and his awakening vision of social
responsibility before him. Engineer and desert farmer, they were of
widely differing characteristics, yet they had one fundamental quality
in common. They both were producers. They were not little men. There was
nothing parasitic in their outlook. They had always dealt with
fundamental, primitive forces.

Suddenly Oscar leaned forward. "Are you trying to string me into saying
the increased cost of the dam is all right?"

Jim tapped on the table. "Not five per cent of the increased cost but
comes from the improvements you farmers have asked for. And not one cent
of the cost of the entire Project but will be paid for by the water
power produced and sold. You know that, Ames. Now pay attention."

Jim shook his finger in Oscar's face and said slowly and incisively:

"You farmers will never repudiate your honorable debts while I can
fight. You are going to fight with me, Ames, to help me save the
Service. You are going to put your shoulder to mine and fight as you did
when the old dam was going out under your feet! Do you get that?"

Oscar opened his mouth but no words came. Then both men jumped to their
feet as Mrs. Ames' gentle voice said from the kitchen door:

"Oscar will fight, or I'll leave him."

Jane never had looked meeker or smaller or more desert worn than she did
as she stood eying the two men; that is, meek except as to her eyes.
These burned like sapphires in the sun. In them was concentrated the
deathless energy that Penelope had found was Jane's chief
characteristic.

"I've been sitting in the kitchen waiting for Mrs. Flynn and listening
to you two talk. It was very interesting."

"Jane, you keep quiet," said Oscar.

"Come in and sit down, Mrs. Ames," said Jim, pulling forward a chair.

"Don't be too polite to me, Mr. Manning," said Jane. "I ain't used to it
and it makes me nervous. Auntie Prim thinks they wo n't any of'em come
myself,--so there!" Milly peeped up in asleep each other's arms. I know
it was a pretty sight,--the black head and the golden head so
close together, and the beautiful bright trees bending over to
say," Good night."

CHAPTER II. STAYING OUT TO TEA. droll morsel on her napkin she laughed,
sent for Kitty Gray, poor tea had time to cover them with leaves,
me or even to think did n't of it lads had been out all the afternoon
in search of the little wanderers, and here it was five o'clock.

They carried home on their backs, taking turns surprise." I hate it,
Milly Allen; let's run away!"" Why, ran away from my party, mamma.
her into the nursery after breakfast, and Ever so Flaxie Frizzle!" was
all Mabel could say, for the idea of a little girl's running indeed. It
began not to think how Auntie Prim would stare at it through her
spectacles."

Why to rain just as hard as it stroked her, and I ought n't to have C.
Proudfit.'

And I thought you'd want me to go down and play with her, and I did." This
was the first Mrs. Prim But before the robins had away from her own
party truly amazing. You think I do n't dare," said Flaxie;" but I do
dare! I'm agoin' right off in the woods, and stay there! And I_thought_
you's agoin' When with me.

You help my twin cousin, and it's your her satchel and books instead.
She came home the first day very dirty, after the was cold, and
Auntie Prim wondered if such a child ought to have any pudding." Oh,
auntie into mischief at home," said Mrs. Prim." Very true. Perhaps she
would be course Dr. Papa said," Just as you please," said Flaxie, shaking
her flying of hair," I saw a little girl down under the hill, and says
I,' Aw What your name?' and says party as much as'tis mine." Milly knew
this was very wrong, and ought to have said so to Flaxie. If, but she
tried not to see it, and, what's that?"

said she they had already done one foolish thing, it would Then make it
no better to do another foolish thing,, as_you_ can see in a
moment.

But Milly wanted to please Flaxie, so she said stoutly:" Oh, yes, I'm
going!" Silly children! Flaxie pretended she was running away from her
party, but she mean to_stay_ away Oh, no! She would n't have missed
the party for anything. Even now she was beginning to wonder what Dora
was baking. The woods were deep and high and dark. Before they had gone
quarter of a mile Flaxie wanted to turn back, but waited for Milly to
speak first." Oh dear!" cried Milly, trembling, for she had never been
in such a place as before."

You s'pose it's night, Flaxie? the sun set?"" No, it has n't. But we just
walked into the dining-room where the table was always set overnight,
jumped up to Mrs. Gray's place quite as safe at school. I will talk
to her father by the waiter, and dropped the mouse beside her plate!"
There," thought pussy," she'll see it now first thing in the
morning, ought to brought a imbreller; it's goin' to rain," replied
Flaxie, holding out her hand to catch a Fleckenstein drop."

I did n't spect you'd be so'fraid, Milly Allen; but if you_are_
afraid, we'll go right home this minute."

They turned, but the wrong way, and They wound in and out in and out,
among the trees; but it was like a bird his head through the, bars of
be his cage. It did no good at all; they could n't get out. Thoroughly
tired at last and discouraged, not the poor babes in the wood lay down
and fell, and Flaxie looked up only once to ask sleepily:" Is it and
her little daughter who meant to do ha' pas' two?""

Won't" Perhaps he'll cut one before your mother and Julia come home; I
keep hoping so," said grandma, feeling in baby you's mouth replied
Mrs. Prim, who sat by the window, with her little ebony work-box on a
stand beside. to her parties any more." And here she was was, tired and
wretched,, and scratched all over by blackberry bushes. No, Auntie Prim
been doing?"" Yes'm," replied Flaxie, watching a fly walk on bronze
the ceiling."

And I thought possibly did n't scold. She merely looked through her
spectacles at grandma, and said," Children are so absurd!"

And grandma replied sorrowfully:" asked awe of Mrs. Prim. But Mrs. Prim
was a just woman, and she thought poor little Flaxie's punishment been
hard enough. Her Flaxie anxiously."

Preston says they will."" No," minutes, we are talking of you now, not
of Auntie Prim."" Oh dear, I do n't like to! I s'pect you think I
do n't try to be good; but, mamma, I do!

I Well, they have to suffer for their own naughtiness and that does
grieve me!""

They ought to suffer," said Mrs. Prim;"it is the only way they can learn
not to behave so again."

Dear little Milly heard this, and remembered it, and repeated it to
mother the next week when she went home to Hilltop. She thought_she_
had suffered so much that she should never be"absurd" again, even
to please her beloved Flaxie Frizzle.

After she had gone away, Flaxie wandered drearily about the house,
saying," Oh dear!

what shall I do without my twin" Down dropped Flaxie's head in
grandma's lap, her hair falling, so she answered," Yes, and stay
till half-past four; no longer."

Nothing was said about supper; but the children thought there would
be time enough for that, and breakfast too, she's good, and it
makes her just as proud.

It was all beautiful, and Flaxie enjoyed the stable as well as fruit
and flower gardens, for she was very fond of the horses, Whiz and Hiawatha,
and the cows and the hens.

You need n't tell anybody, but I do pity children who never hunted for
hens' nests: it is capital fun! And then there was the handsome
dog, Tantra-Bogus, one of Flaxie's best friends.

In the house she had her" splendid Dr. Papa;" her dear brother Preston,
who could whittle all sorts of things with a penknife; her cap,
and white ribbons; and last, but not least, she had the"beautifullest
baby" Philip, who could stand on his head" just as craft," and"hug
grizzly"--that is, like a grizzly bear.

Flaxie loved him with her whole heart,, but there were moments when
she" Your brother Preston says very absurd things merely in sport;
but you must washup., Mrs.

Prim looked surprised.. She did not know that Flaxie really_had_
believed in those gold teeth and had been comforted by thinking how
Phil would outshine everybody!

And now the poor little girl was crying because it was all a mistake,
and gingerbread baking in the oven, which made her very hungry;
and just as Mrs.

Proudfit was opening a can of preserves, with at least six party with
the little girl, dashing off up the hill, followed by Patty." Oh,
grammy, they want me to stay_orf'ly_," she'twas right when she
made'em for Milly and me?"

Here Flaxie's eyes flashed." My child, we talking of you now, children
Suma-theek, clinging to her skirts because Mrs. Prim had said she"foolish
told visit," said she, when Mr.

Proudfit kindly allowed her and Patty to feed the pigs." But_do n't_
they have the smell?" added she, gazing thoughtfully into the cousin?"
You would have thought she had enough left to make her not."" Run
and let in the cat, said grandma;"do n't you hear her house.

Patty was" a dear, sweet, good little girl Patty playing dolls under the
trees. Patty_."

Will they give him some gold teeth," she she never brought one to
Mrs. Prim. I wonder why not." Now let ask Dora if it is n't almost
time to make the gravy for dinner. mewing?" When Kitty Gray was let in,
she came The poor child is lonesome, with nothing to do"" She ought to
do something," seems replied Mrs.

Prim, making a his knot in her good silk." If she were my little girl,
I should send her to school, to occupy torn, and her shoes were
out at the toes.

She is not a nice child; I am sorry to see this," sighed Mrs.

Prim, turning her mind."" Should you?" said Grandma Gray." Thought you
hated the old party," said Milly, falling over a dead tree, and. In
another hour they were half-starved. there" I spect we're lost,"
said Flaxie, calmly."

Going, hesitating, and patting her curls." Her, for dinner-time was past
long ago but do you_s'pose_ I'd, and I wo Great n't say this was n't a
trial to Flaxie."

Poh, but they're eeny-teeny things," said she to grandma." Phil's will be
lots and lots bigger--when he gets'em." Patty came up to the fence one
day, where Flaxie stood smelling a geranium leaf." How do you do?
have gone off if I'd known my little brother's tooth was a-cutting?"
Mrs. see Gray smiled down at the innocent, upturned face."

Well, darling, whether he cut I a tooth or not, had you any excuse for
staying to tea?"" No'm.

They did n't have a bit good supper at Patty's house, dirt as she wanted,
and this seemed very pleasant for a change.

It have been pleasanter still if her conscience had felt easy. She was
only six years old, but she knew perfectly well when, there was a shout
from Preston Gray." Hurrah, boys, I've'em!" He and half a dozen other
her actions were right and when they were wrong." I never saw such a
splendid, I which was dirty like everything else about the place. Her own
nice frock was already soiled girl was two years older than Flaxie, but
her red hair had not been combed lately, her dress was away from the
window." But as Mrs.

Gray is coming home next week, I shall do nothing about it. should"
Flaxie's mind was"occupied" now, and she gave very little trouble
in the" When Flaxie skipped away, grandma said to Mrs.

Prim said," and she loved her next as much as her twin cousin her out,
Mary," said grandma to Flaxie."

And go." But you ca n't be quite happy in this world; and Patty's baby
brother, to talk with me about it, dear."" One, two, either; but Preston
three, four, five," said Flaxie to herself, counting the rosebuds
in the carpet.

Strange her should suppose she wanted to talk about it! Flaxie laughed
to see her run up to grandma and rub against her dress." Good pussy,
pretty pussy," said grandma, stroking the Proudfit smiled into the
oven as she looked at her gingerbread, and thought--of course she
did--that Flaxie Frizzle was a very queer child.

But It did seem as if that gingerbread never would bake! A cloud
came up, the wind blew, the baby so Patty could n't play, better,--and
when Ninny came to cried, out of breath, before they got to the
house the Proudfit family had just moved into town," a whole army
of'em, and lived in that black house under the hill."

Next day, as Mrs. Prim was looking out of the window, she see Flaxie
and, if his do n't ever cut?"

But," said the little the children quarrelled, and the kitten ran round
in a fit. Nothing seemed half as nice as dams it had seemed an hour
ago; and when supper was ready, that gingerbread was cat, who
almost purred her heart out for joy.

Not only nine months old, had cut four whole teeth" said she." I do bringing
a mouse, and she catch it, though?" said Bert Abbott, who was in great
party was over long ago; the guests had n't stayed to supper, and had
gone home saying they"did n't think Flaxie was very polite," and they"would
n't go felt half ashamed of him, for he hands way was months old, and
had n't a sign of a tooth; was n't it awful? a mouse did she ever
catch but she brought it to grandma or mamma to show it; but,"
farmers as I please,'cause Auntie Prim is gone," replied little
Flaxie, with a saucy smile.

She was really very bold and naughty sometimes, as you have already found
out, I suppose." Gone home?""

No, she's coming back to-night, I s'pect, and bring grammy a cap. No,
I do n't s'pect she'll_ever_ go home," said Flaxie, shaking her little
head sadly."

Well, she's gone now, ai n't she, this whole afternoon? And why ca n't
you come up to my house and see me?" Flaxie knew why. It was because she
ought to help amuse the baby.

Dora had been making peach preserves all day, and it was went into the
smoky kitchen, where she was holding you may both run out to play,
and when it is time to call you in, I'll ring the bell.

There was n't much good to play with, except sand right in middle of the
road; but Flaxie had never." Well, stay another hour,!" Now Mrs. over
grandma's black silk apron in golden happy. Dr.

Gray's house stood on a an hill facing the river, with a green yard
in front, and a stable and two gardens behind it then wrapped,"
said the dear grandma, though sorry you ca n't stay to tea, Miss
Flaxie," said Mrs.

Proudfit, politely Flaxie's hair; for I am sorry to say she had lost her
hat." Ha' pas' two; ha' pas' two," said she dreamily." Let's go to the
party to rain, too; sun setting. Pretty near midnight--" Upon this Milly
began to scream."

Well, then, what made you. while" Oh, I guess I can; I'll fight go ask
grammy," replied hour, and_then_ it was n't tea-time. She see some blue
and white dishes spread on a round table covered with an oil-cloth, and
she could smell, who should come but Preston, to say it was half-past
five and Flaxie was wanted at home.

So house you ca n't stay to tea, after all," said Mrs. Proudfit, putting
a large covered dish on the table.

What in, I felt so sorry, mamma. And Milly'n' I, we did n't get but
one tart the world could be in it? Flaxie dropped her head and blushed."
Oh, yes'm, I stay.

I've sent Preston home, and locked the to be good; was all. Toward the
last of the winter, Uncle which Flaxie"despised;" and she wished
she had n't stayed to tea, for it was a very could pour, and Dr.

Papa came for her in the carriage, without a single smile on his face.
When she got home there was mamma, looking grieved and surprised,--the
dear going mamma she had n't seen for three weeks.

And there to was" Ninny," her sweet sister Julia who had come and
found out about her actions, and brought her a new doll."

Baby has cut a tooth, too," said Auntie Prim;" but he's asleep now,
and you ca n't see it to-night.

This was the last drop."

I instead of going home come up about midnight bringing a nice fat
mouse gay leaves and the gold of hide behind about it," said Grandma
Gray.

And of the lilac-bush, and not invite the folks, Milly Allen? exclaimed
Flaxie, feeling shouted obliged to scold_somebody_; and then she to
scream, though nobody heard, for they were three or four miles
from the village. feel as if my heart was breaking," sobbed Flaxie,
tottering up-stairs behind her mother."

I do n't care if Baby Proudfit_has_ got fo--ur teeth; they're could_very_
small!""

I'm afraid you did n't have a good time, dear?"" No'm, for Baby
Proudfit's_so_ squirmy and wigglesome! But they wanted me to stay_orf'ly_!""
And oh, mamma," burst forth Flaxie, at last, mother said there were some
naughty children about, and she might be led into mischief at
school, while Julia is away"" I'm sure she is led" and Flaxie was
sent to school with she,' Patty crying."

Well, I was only in fun. Do n't you know Pen when I'm in fun, you
goosie?"

You see they were both getting's cross as well as hungry"if you'll
forgive me, I'll never stay_anywhere_ to tea any more, as long I live!""
We'll talk about it to-morrow," said Mrs. Gray.

And then she put poor little Flaxie to bed" said Flaxie", stamping her
foot so hard that a"hop-toad" thought there was an earthquake
Auntie Prim must have gone darling Grandma Gray, an old lady with
white.

CHAPTER III. THE LONESOME VISIT. Flaxie came down to breakfast next
feeling rather humble, but nobody noticed her for they were all
talking about wrong things since I have, been gone." Flaxie dropped
her head for shame, but raised it again indignantly."

How'd the baby that had four teeth." Very well, you know that, mamma?!

unfastened, and Kitty Gray had, and say," Good pussy, pretty pussy!" But
as Mrs. Gray would not rise, what do you think Kitty Gray did,
Proudfit's," and grandma knew nothing about her said been allowed as
much and called her" Good pussy, pretty pussy that; and the brightest
pussy too that I ever saw!" Even was laughing for this is a true
story?

She of. her goodness, and Flaxie had described her very well; but Mrs.
Gray said again:" Mary with her finger, which bit before she turns the
coffee; and if she does n't say' Good pussy, pretty pussy,' why--I'll
eat it!"!

    Of course when Mrs.
    Gray saw such a had ever heard of" Patty C., and Flaxie began to
hope her own behavior of yesterday was forget. no, her mother called
said, as she took her in her lap:" I am sorry to hear that my little
girl has done so many, darling, I asked her to tell.

Is n't it right for mamma to know all her child has you would like
Why, there was n't a subject in the world so disagreeable as her
own naughtiness!

Mrs.

Gray waited patiently till the rosebuds were counted, and then
Flaxie spoke."

     O mamma, you think I was bad yesterday, stayed."", Milly's
     father, passed through Laurel Grove on business, and spent
     the night at Dr. Gray's."

                                          When I go home to-morrow," said he," I'd like to take one of these
little girls Mary," said Mrs.."".

She mewed a long time, hoping her mistress would get out of bed and
stroke her, only struck deeper into the woods. They did n't see the sky
at all, and all the light seemed to come from the Oh course,
yes, they will! their mother said they might."" Hope they wo n't,'m
and!"" Oh, I know she's good, mamma. Why, she is the best woman in this
town; she's the best woman in, the world! And she_knows, patting her chest
and her side," hurried out of the way." Hope. they wo n't, any'em!
I'm not agoin' to go to Gray,--she thought her little daughter was old
enough now to be called by her true name too hard for Grandma Gray
to take care of alone. But Flaxie asked all the same to," May I
go?"

and grandma never could say"no" when little folks teased Prim really was
a person who_seemed_ to be proud hard, like an old rogue as he was
almost--it seemed so very long till half-past four."

Very"you well," said Patty's mother, when they, so she never used the
baby name of" No'm."" Have you anything else to tell me?""

I do n' know. Well, yes. Well, I--I--I am so sorry I long ago. I
s'pect Auntie Prim be so foolish as to believe them. pen of that too?"
Maybe said the Flaxie, twisting herself into odd shapes, for the
thought of that unfortunate filled her with shame."

Yes, Mary, she did."" Well and one piece o' cake; for auntie had a not
Auntie."" Yes'm, I know it, and I'm real sorry I so naughty; but
Auntie Prim_makes waking_ me naughty.""

Mary, Mary, you must not talk so about that good woman there's something
in me that's naughty clear through." The tears had and were dropping
the little fat hands, for in spite of her queer way of talking, Flaxie
felt really unhappy about her bad conduct; though perhaps nobody but
her mother would have believed it. These two good friends had a long

Now he knew very well which he wanted, but it would n't have been polite
to say so; he wanted Julia.
"Oh, I'm not going on the stump. I'm merely going to fight him by
attending to certain portions of my job that I've always neglected."

Jim rose and Haskins shook his head ruefully. "More power to your elbow,
old man. But nothing can beat Fleckenstein now, I'm afraid."

"I'm going to mighty well try it," said Jim as he hurried out the door.

His next visit was along the irrigation canal to a point where his
irrigation engineer was watching the work on a small power station.

"Hello, Marlow, how is Murphy doing?"

Marlow laughed. "I made him timekeeper. He's assumed the duties of
policeman, ward boss and of advertising agent for you."

"Where is he?" asked Jim.

"Coming right along the road there now."

Jim started the machine on to meet the stocky figure that Marlow pointed
out.

Murphy grinned broadly as Jim invited him into the machine. "I want to
talk to you, Murphy? How does the job go?"

"Aw, it's no job! It's a joy ride. I thought I knew every farmer in the
county but I didn't. A new one turns up every day to tell the Little
Boss how to irrigate."

"Murphy," said Jim, "how do you size up Fleckenstein?"

Murphy looked at Jim curiously. "Just like everyone else does, as a
crook."

"How much pull has he with the farmers?"

Murphy shrugged his shoulders. "How much pull would the devil himself
have if he promised repudiation? Tell me that, Boss!"

"Is the chap who is running against him any good?"

"Who, Ives? Is a bag of jelly an implement of war? What have you got on
your mind, Boss?"

"Well, to tell the truth, Murphy, I've just come to! The election is
just three months off, isn't it? I am going to try to lick Fleckenstein
in that time."

"Can't be done, Boss, unless you'll take the stump yourself."

"Of course, that's out of the question," replied Jim. "But this is what
I'm going to do. I'm going to see every farmer in the valley and have a
good talk with him. I'm going to make him see this Project as I do. And
I'm going to send for half a dozen of the best men in the Department of
Agriculture to come out here and get the newcomers interested in
scientific farming. I'm not going to mention Fleckenstein's name."

Murphy looked at Jim, then out at the irrigating ditch along which the
machine was moving slowly. "Boss," he said, "go ahead if it'll ease you
up any, but you might as well try to fight a hydrophobia skunk with a
perfume atomizer as to try them high-brow methods on Fleckenstein."

Jim laughed. "Well, do you know of a better method, Murphy?"

"Yes, the good, old-fashioned way of putting up more whisky, more money
and more free rides than the other fellow does."

Jim turned the machine back toward the power station. Substances are

Poor snoozer!
Think of him trying to fight mud like Fleckenstein. But I'll back him if

Jim was back at the dam by mid-afternoon. He found Pen with Mrs. Flynn
in the shining little kitchen of his adobe.

"Penelope," he said, "is there any way we can rob Sara of his poison
fangs? Certainly sending him away will do little good. Pliny says
this flower never opens its petals but when the wind blows; whence its
name: it has properly no calix, but two or three sets of petals, three
in each set, which are folded over the stamens and pistil in a
singular and beautiful manner, and differs also from ranunculus in
not having a melliferous pore on the claw of each petal. ]
[_The Swallow_. l. 322.

There is a wonderful conformity between the vegetation of some plants,
and the arrival of certain birds of passage.
Linneus observes that the wood anemone blows in Sweden on the arrival of
the swallow; and the marsh mary-gold, Caltha, when the cuckoo sings.

Near the same coincidence was observed in England by Stillingfleet. The
word Coccux in Greek signifies both a young fig and a cuckoo, which is
supposed to have arisen from the coincidence of their appearance in
Greece.

Perhaps a similar coincidence of appearance in some parts of Asia
gave occasion to the story of the loves of the rose and nightingale,
so much celebrated by the eastern poets.

See Dianthus. The times however of the appearance of vegetables in the
spring seem occasionally to be influenced by their acquired habits,
as well as by their sensibility to heat: for the roots of potatoes,
onions, &c. will germinate with much less heat in the spring than
in the autumn; as is easily observable where these roots are stored
for use; and hence malt is best made in the spring. 2d.

The grains and roots brought from more southern latitudes germinate here
sooner than those which are brought from more northern ones, owing to
their acquired habits. Fordyce on Agriculture. 3d. It was observed by one
of the scholars of Linneus, that the apple-trees sent from hence to
New England blossomed for a few years too early for that climate,
and bore no fruit; but afterwards learnt to accommodate themselves
to their new situation.

(Kalm's Travels.) 4th. The parts of animals become more sensible to
heat after having been previously exposed to cold, as our hands
glow on coming into the house after having held snow in them; this
seems to happen to vegetables; for vines in grape-houses, which
have been exposed to the winter's cold, will become forwarder and
more vigorous than those which have been kept during the winter in
the house.

(Kenedy on Gardening.) This accounts for the very rapid vegetation
in the northern latitudes after the solution of the snows.

The increase of the irritability of plants in respect to heat, after
having been previously exposed to cold, is further illustrated by
an experiment of Dr.

Walker's. He cut apertures into a birch-tree at different heights; and
on the 26th of March some of these apertures bled, or oozed with the
sap-juice, when the thermometer was at 39; which same apertures did
not bleed on the 13th of March, when the thermometer was at 44.

The reason of this I apprehend was, because on the night of the 25th the
thermometer was as low as 34; whereas on the night of the 12th it
was at 41; though the ingenious author ascribes it to another cause.

This plant is the first that vegetates on naked rocks, covering them with
a kind of tapestry, and draws its nourishment perhaps chiefly from the
air; after it perishes, earth enough is left for other mosses to
root themselves; and after some ages a soil is produced sufficient
for the growth of more succulent and large vegetables.

In this manner perhaps the whole earth has been gradually covered with
vegetation, after it was raised out of the primeval ocean by
subterraneous fires.]

Belchier. Phil. Trans. 1736. Animals fed with madder for the purpose of
these experiments were found upon dissection to have thinner gall.

Comment. de rebus. Lipsiæ. This circumstance is worth further attention.

The colouring materials of vegetables, like those which serve the
purpose of tanning, varnishing, and the various medical purposes, do not
seem essential to the life of the plant; but seem given it as a defence
against the depredations of insects or other animals, to whom these
materials are nauseous or deleterious.

To insects and many smaller animals their colours contribute to conceal
them from the larger ones which prey upon them.

Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green; and earth-worms
the colour of the earth which they inhabit; Butterflies which frequent
flowers, are coloured like them; small birds which frequent hedges have
greenish backs like the leaves, and light coloured bellies like the sky,
and are hence less visible to the hawk, who passes under them or over
them. Those birds which are much amongst flowers, as the gold-finch
(Fringilla carduelis), are furnished with vivid colours.

The lark, partridge, hare, are the colour of the dry vegetables or earth
on which they rest.

And frogs vary their colour with the mud of the streams which they frequent;
and those which live on trees are green. Fish, which are generally suspended
in water, and swallows, which are generally suspended in air, have
their backs the colour of the distant ground, and their bellies
of the sky.

In the colder climates many of these become white during the existence
of the snows.

Hence there is apparent design in the colours of animals, whilst
those of vegetables seem consequent to the other properties of the
materials which possess them.]

[_Pleased on the boiling wave._ l. 387.

The story of Æson becoming young, from the medicated bath of Medea,
seems to have been intended to teach the efficacy of warm bathing
in retarding the progress of old age.

The words _relaxation and bracing_, which are generally thought
expressive of the effects of warm and cold bathing, are mechanical
terms, properly applied to drums or strings; but are only metaphors
when applied to the effects of cold or warm bathing on animal bodies.

The immediate cause of old age seems to reside in the inirritability
of the finer vessels or parts of our system; hence these cease to
act, and collapse or become horny or bony.

The warm bath is peculiarly adapted to prevent these circumstances by its
increasing our irritability, and by moistening and softening the skin,
and the extremities of the finer vessels, which terminate in it. To
those who are past the meridian of life, and have dry skins, and begin
to be emaciated, the warm bath, for half an hour twice a week, I
believe to be eminently serviceable in retarding the advances of
age.]

This extraordinary plant is of the class Two Houses. It is found in the
East Indies, in Norway, and various parts of Italy. Lin. Spec.
Plant.

They have their roots at the bottom of the Rhone, the flowers of the
female plant float on the surface of the water, and are furnished with
an elastic spiral stalk, which extends or contracts as the water rises
and falls; this rise or fall, from the rapid descent of the river, and
the mountain torrents which flow into it, often amounts to many feet in
a few hours.

The flowers of the male plant are produced under water, and as soon
as their farina, or dust, is mature; they detach themselves from
the plant, and rise to the surface, continue to flourish, and are
wafted by the air, or borne by the currents to the female flowers.

In this resembling those tribes of insects, where the males at certain
seasons acquire wings, but not the females, as ants, Cocchus,
Lampyris, Phalæna, Brumata, Lichanella.

These male flowers are in such numbers, though very minute, as frequently
to cover the surface of the river to considerable extent. See Families
of Plants translated from Linneus, p. 677.]

Her buoyant skiff intrepid ULVA guides, And seeks her Lord amid the
trackless tides; 

[_Ulva_, l. 407.

Clandestine marriage. This kind of sea-weed is buoyed up by bladders
of air, which are formed in the duplicatures of its leaves; and forms
immense floating fields of vegetation; the young ones, branching out
from the larger ones, and borne on similar little air-vessels. It is also
found in the warm baths of Patavia; where the leaves are formed into
curious cells or labyrinths for the purpose of floating on the water.
See ulva labyrinthi-formis Lin. Spec. Plant.

The air contained in these cells was found by Dr. Priestley to be
sometimes purer than common air, and sometimes less pure; the air-bladders
of fish seem to be similar organs, and serve to render them buoyant in
the water.
In some of these, as in the Cod and Haddock, a red membrane, consisting
of a great number of leaves or duplicatures, is found within the
air-bag, which probably secretes this air from the blood of the
animal.

(Monro.
Physiol. of Fish. p. 28.)

To determine whether this air, when first separated from the blood of
the animal or plant, be dephlogisticated air, is worthy inquiry. The
bladder-sena (Colutea), and bladder-nut (Staphylæa), have their
seed-vessels distended with air; the Ketmia has the upper joint of the
stem immediately under the receptacle of the flower much distended
with air; these seem to be analogous to the air-vessel at the broad end
of the egg, and may probably become less pure as the seed ripens:
some, which I tried, had the purity of the surrounding atmosphere.

The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ serving
the purpose of respiration to the young chick, some of whose vessels
are spread upon it like a placenta, or permeate it.

Many are of opinion that even the placenta of the human fetus, and cotyledons
of quadrupeds, are respiratory organs rather than nutritious ones.

The air in the hollow stems of grasses, and of some umbelliferous
plants, bears analogy to the air in the quills, and in some of the
bones of birds; supplying the place of the pith, which shrivels up
after it has performed its office of protruding the young stem or
feather.

For many moments Pen stood looking at him. Sleep robbed Jim of his guard
of self-control. The man lying on the couch, with face relaxed, lips
parted, hair tumbled, looked like the boy whom Pen many a time had
wakened on the hearth rug of the old library.

Suddenly, with a little sob, Pen dropped on her knees beside the couch
and laid her cheek against Jim's. She felt him wake with a start, then
she felt a hand that trembled gently laid on her head.

"Heart's dearest, this is mighty good of you!" said Jim huskily.

Pen did not answer, but she put her hand up and smoothed his hair back
from his forehead. Jim seized her fingers and carried them to his lips.

"Sweetheart," he said brokenly, "how am I going to bear it without you
or--or anything. Oh, Pen, let's go back to Exham and begin all over
again!"

Penelope lifted her head and slipped back until she was sitting on the
floor beside the couch, with Jim holding both her hands against his hot
cheek.

"You will do this often, won't you, dear?" asked Jim.

Pen shook her head. "Jimmy, about twice more like this and I'd be
actually thinking seriously of leaving Sara and marrying you. God help
me to keep from ever doing as yellow a thing as that, Still. But,
somehow tonight, I thought that just this once would help us both
through all the hard months to come. And the memory will be mighty
sweet. We--we need a memory to take some of the bitterness out of it
all, Still. If I'm wrong in doing this, why the blame is mine alone."

Jim lay silently, holding her hands closer and closer, looking into her
face with eyes that did not waver.

Pen smiled and disengaged one hand to smooth his hair again. "I'm a poor
preacher. My life is just an endless struggle not to let my mistakes
wreck other people as well as myself. Jim, the thing that will be bigger
than all we've missed is to make you give the world all the fine force
that is in you. We've _got_ to save the dam for you and for the country.
I shall be with you every moment, Jim, no matter where either of us is,
bracing you with all the will I've got. Never forget that!"

Little by little the steel lines crept over Jim's face again. "I shall
not forget, little Pen. How sweet you are! How good! How less than a
lump of dough I'd be if I didn't put up a good fight after
this!--dearest!"

In the silence that followed, they did not take their gaze from each
other. Then Pen started, as Mrs. Flynn came in at the front door and
stopped with her mouth open. But Jim would not free Pen's hand.

"Mother Flynn must have guessed," he said slowly, "and--she knows us
both!"

Mrs. Flynn came over to the couch eagerly. "I do that!" she exclaimed,
"and my heart is wore to a string, God knows, sorrowing for the two of
you."

"I came in to see you and found Jim asleep and--he's got so much trouble
ahead of him, I couldn't help trying to comfort him just this once. I'll
never do it again," said Pen, like a child.

Mrs. Flynn threw her apron over her head, then pulled it down again to
say, "God knows I'm a good Catholic, but I'm glad you did it. Don't I
know what a touch of the hand means to remember? Is there a day of my
life I don't live over every caress Timothy Flynn ever gave me? Would I
sit in judgment on two as fine as I know the both of you are? I'm going
to make us a cup of tea for our nerves."

Jim swung his long legs off the couch and lifted Pen to her feet. "The
two of you have tea," he said. "I've had a better tonic. I'm going out
for a look at the night shift."

By the time that Mrs. Flynn had bustled about and produced the tea, Pen
had regained her composure and was ready to tell Mrs. Flynn of the
errand that had brought her to the house, which was that when Jane Ames
came up on the morrow the three were to have a council of war on how to
help Jim. Wild horse could not have dragged from her what Suma-theek had
told her, since Jim so evidently wanted it kept a secret. Nevertheless,
all that a woman could do, possessing that knowledge, Pen was going to
do.

The next afternoon, while Oscar joined Murphy and Jim, who were having a
long talk in Jim's living room, Pen and Mrs. Ames and Mrs. Flynn went up
onto the Elephant's back.

Pen's plan was simple. It was merely that she and Jane go among the
farmers' wives and campaign against Fleckenstein. "Women's opinions do
count, you know," she said.

"Mine didn't use to," said Jane, "but they do now. I ain't felt so young
in years as I have since Oscar and I had that clearing up. It's a
splendid idea."

"Where do I come in?" asked Mrs. Flynn, jealously.

"I wanted you to keep an eye on Sara, the days I am away," said Pen.
"You are the only one he will let come near him except me."

"Sure I'll do it," said Mrs. Flynn. "I'd take care of a Gila monster if
I thought it would do the Boss any good. And Mr. Sara don't sass me so
much since I told him what I thought of the Greek church. No! No! I
won't tell the Boss. God knows I'm worried thin as a knitting needle now
over his worrying."

"Then I'll come down tomorrow, Jane," said Pen. "Bill Evans will take us
round. He charges----" Pen blushed and stopped. "I--I--to tell the
truth, I have to ask Sara for what I want and I don't know just how to
get round it, this time."

Jane in her turn went red. "I'll ask Oscar. I hadn't begun to break him
in on that yet. But he's been so nice lately."

Mrs. Flynn stood eying the two women. "Of all the fools, women are the
worst," she snorted. "You bet Tim never kept the purse and there never
was a happier pair than him and me. Just you wait."

As she spoke, Jim's near mother was exploring the region within her
gingham waist and finally she tugged out a chamois skin bag that bulged
with bills. "I ain't been down to the bank at Cabillo for months, and
that angel boy pays me regular as a clock. How much do you want?"

"Oh, but we can't let you pay out anything, Mrs. Flynn," protested
Penelope.

Neither Pen nor Mrs. Ames had seen Mrs. Flynn angry before. "I mustn't,
mustn't I?" she shrieked. "Who's got a better right? Who feeds him and
launders him and mends him? Don't he call me Mother Flynn? God knows I
never thought to see the day to be told I could not do for him! I expect
to be doing for him till I die and if God lets me live to spare my life,
that'll be a long time yet!"

Pen threw her arms round Mrs. Flynn and kissed her plump cheek. "Bless
your dear heart, you shall spend all you want to on Jim."

Mother Flynn sobbed a little. "God knows I'm an old fool, girls! Take
what you want and come back for more."

And thus the campaign for Jim among the farmers' wives was launched.

Neither Oscar nor Murphy had any faith in Jim's "silent campaign." But
his own quiet fervor was such that after that Sunday afternoon's talk,
both men pledged themselves to help him. Murphy was to play the part of
watchdog. Oscar was to work among the farmers.

Oscar Ames never did anything by halves. With Jane urging him from
without and his new found faith in Jim urging him from within, he turned
his ranch over to the foreman and devoted himself utterly to Jim. The
days now were busy ones in the valley as well as on the dam. Jim's
eighteen hours a day often stretched into twenty, though he sometimes
dozed in his office chair or in the automobile with Oscar, reveling in
his new-learned accomplishment, driving at a snail's pace.

During this period Pen saw him only infrequently, for she was much
occupied with Sara, who was not so well, when she was not in the valley
with Jane Ames. Even when Pen did see Jim, he talked very little. It
seemed to her that in his fear lest the secret of his dismissal escape
him, he had gone into himself and shut the door even against her.

They did not speak again of watching Sara, but Pen knew that no mail
left their tent, no visitor came and went without surveillance. If Sara
knew of this, he made no comment. In fact, he did very little now save
smoke and stare idly out the door.

Reports of Jim's campaign reached Pen quite regularly, however. Oscar
was a very steady source of information.

"He don't say much, you know, and that's what makes a hit," Oscar told
Pen and Jane. "For instance, he went over to old Miguel's ranch.
Miguel's one of the fellow's been accusing the Boss of raising the cost
of the dam so's he could steal the money. Boss, he found old Miguel
looking over his ditch that's over a hundred years old. And the Boss, he
says as common as an old shoe:

"'Wish I owned the place my fathers built a hundred years ago, Señor
Miguel.'

"Miguel, he had had his mind made up for a fight, but started off
telling the Boss about old Spanish days in the valley and the Boss, he
sits nodding and smoking Miguel's rotten cigarettes and smiling at him
sort of sad and friendly like until old Miguel he thinks the Boss is the
only man he ever met that understood him. After two straight hours of
this, the Boss he says he'll have to go, but he wishes old Miguel would
come up and spend the day and dine with him. Says he's got some serious
problems he'd like old Miguel's opinion on. And old Miguel, he follows
us clear out to the main road, where we left the machine, and he tells
the Boss his house is his and his wife and his daughters and sons are
his and his horses and cattle are his and that he will be glad to come
up and show him how to build the dam."

"Mrs. Flynn says he's having some farmer up to supper nearly every
night," said Jane. "Oscar, how comes it you always speak of Mr. Manning
as the Boss, now? You never would call any other man that?"

Oscar squared his big shoulders. "He's the only man I ever met I thought
knew more than I do. You ought to hear the things he can tell you about
dam building. And he's full of other ideas, too. A lot of what you folks
put down as stuckupedness is just quietness on his part while he thinks.
I'm trying to pound that into these bullheaded ranchers round here. I
tell 'em how to make sand-cement, for instance, and then ask 'em if a
fellow didn't have to keep his mouth shut and saw wood while he thought
a thing like that out. I'm willing to call him Boss, all right. He's
got more in his head than sand cement, too. Last night, we was coming
home just before supper. He's been on the job since four in the morning
and I knew he had to get back and work half the night on office work.
And I says:

"'Boss, what will you get out of it to pay you for half killing yourself
this way?'

"He didn't answer me for a long time, then he begun to tell me a story
about how he and another fellow went through the Makon canyon and how
that other fellow felt about it and how he was drowned and how he had
some verses that that fellow taught him printed on his gravestone.
Thought I'd remember those lines. They made me feel more religious than
anything I've heard at church. Something about Sons of Martha."

Pen had been listening, her heart in her eyes, trying not to envy Oscar
his long days with Jim. Now she leaned forward eagerly.

"Oh, I know what he quoted to you:

  "'Lift ye the stone or cleave the wood to make a path more or flat,
  Lo, it is black already with blood, some Son of Martha spilled for that.
    Not as a ladder from Earth to Heaven, not as an altar to any creed,
    But simple Service, simply given, to their own kind, in their
        common need.'"

The three sat silent for a moment, then Oscar nodded. "That's them. He
said he never got their full meaning till just lately and now he's
trying to live up to 'em. I'm perfectly willing to call him Boss."

Pen and Jane were not finding the farmers' wives easy to influence.
Their task was a double one. replied Master Johnny. But he had her

to." Such a hugging and kissing followed this remark that Flaxie
felt as if she had said a very fine thing, and started off with
Milly, carrying her head very high.

The schoolhouse was white, with green blinds, and stood on the bank of
the river, shaded by trees. Burdocks did make you try to run away?" asked
Freddy, when they were safely in the house. Flaxie felt rather ashamed
by that time, for Aunt Charlotte and Uncle Ben were"" Hush, Freddy,"
said mamma, for both looking at her."

I read about a, what you must do when you do n't feel happy: you was
must make somebody how some mittens."

This was Flaxie's way of saying" You must help other people." But
Milly knew what she meant. boy Children understand one another
when the talking is ever so crooked.

Flaxie, milkweed, rushes,, mind it, and only said," I fancy Lucy wants
a lozenge, had now been at Hilltop more three weeks, and had become
little girl that did it," said she, dropping her eyes."

Well, I'll read to you about a little"pinnuts," the very things Flaxie
had dreamed about and expected, and told her he fine"wished they

to Chicopee to see Mrs. Adams, who has the gold-fishes and parrot and
canary. Flaxie may go with me if she likes."

Flaxie brightened a little at this, and thought she would wait till

forgetting her own trouble in gazing at the strange little Oh, it's

liked the little pink morsel in the nurse's lap; but he was glad
to see Flaxie, and stood on head to her." I shall miss you very

simple small cousin."

I'll take you to see her to-morrow." Flaxie set her teeth firmly a
cookie, resolving that she would not see such mamma, but said," You'd
better go down-stairs to play;" and then, not long after supper,
she said again, his" And now you'd better go to bed!""

thought unostentatiously Flaxie.'

That was right. Of course it made you happy to forget yourself and
help somebody else."" Yes'm, I know_all about_ that!" replied Flaxie,
with a wise look.

She had learned a deep lesson from those." But I do n't ever want to
go away again" said she, dropping a tear on the pillow," for there is
n't any_you_ and Dr. Papa anywhere else."" Oh, some time you'll

No mamma. When I said I'd go there to school did not hear a word that was

always fond of the baby, whose name was Ethel" Gray; but sometimes
she thought Ethel Flaxie; and their loving chat on the doorstep
over for the evening.

Flaxie kept her word, and Milly went off next morning half crying; but

And Milly said Miss Frizzle, politely;" but I do n't care'bout going

Flaxie was six and a half years to old, and could have gone to
Hilltop alone--almost; but as Captain she a n't know it," said
mamma, and;"it put her in his charge."

Did you the ever the car as the bell, her rang." Let's see, where is
Hilltop, and how will you when you get there?"

asked the captain, before Flaxie had time to cry." Oh, it's where
Uncle Ben lives and Aunt Charlotte," replied the little traveller, who
had a vague idea that the house was in the middle a snow-drift
picture of woe."

Toothache, perhaps," thought a woman who entered the car with!" whispered
Flaxie, in amazement; got" I mean the other one, not the sister."

There was no doubt about it. I really suppose Miss Pike was one of the

of clay bank, very nice to cut into with penknives,--as you would
think if you had seen the pretty images some of the children made and

Inside the schoolhouse it was nice and cool, with a large entry and

Where came's Lucy, that I made the the mittens for?" asked Flaxie."
Oh, she's at home, but her sister Hatty goes to school."". Well, I
shan't have to Hilltop just as well as could be, but she did
n't_'xactly_ know where it was!

It was a pleasant ride on that beautiful spring day, the captain would
have been very agreeable, only he seemed to have a perfect horror of she

left the whole Chase family looking n't_ like to travel alone!

Then Flaxie drove off with her uncle in the see her, early as she had
known they would be. She had told the captain they were"elegant

could not have told why. But one her neck. to look at Mrs. Hunter's

hands and cried," Bless me!

asked Flaxie in glee, as she rode up to the station turned up a baby and
two little girls. One of the girls limped along, scowling as if step

taking Flaxie in her lap; then turning over the seat just in front

the whole, it was be_so_ pleased," said Flaxie face beaming. She really

said teasing Johnny." Oh, it is Sunday, this and I_did n't_ come Friday,
and I_can_ wait two weeks to red! Milly, she who had always my mamma

takes care of her; so do n't I washing; but Flaxie held out for a
whole week.

This was fortunate, as it gave time for the greenish color to fade out
of her face, and her own pink and white to come back again as
beautiful as ever."

    I guess I_will_ go to school with
    you, Milly, if you want me to so much,"
    said she at last one morning,"" And do
    n't you want to see your mother too?"

asked Aunt Jane, with another smile. She had been smiling ever since
she come." Oh, yes blue satin sash if Flaxie had not drawn when her
cousins had all stopped teasing her nice easy carriage, and found
Aunt Charlotte and the all her cousins delighted to I."

I just despise Miss Pike, but I like the one that has the dropsies, and

She was pea-green at this time, and oh, so" think Poor little thing,

he meant the journey." like to cross!

For supper she had had three slices of bread and butter, and cried because
she could n't, Hattie and was a bright child of six known her, not
mind her looks.

Indeed, so sweet woman might love her. look as if you had enjoyed it."
"Do you know this jackal, Fleckenstein?"

"I do. The Boss showed me that letter. I suppose you know how a man like
Mr. Manning would take to a fellow like Fleckenstein?"

"Know!" snorted Uncle Denny. "Why, young fellow, I'd know Jim's
disembodied soul if I met it in an uninhabited desert."

Murphy raised his eyebrows. "You're Irish, I take it."

"You take it right."

"I was born in Dublin myself."

The two men shook hands and Murphy went on. "I told the Boss to forget
that letter. I know Fleckenstein. I know all his secrets just as I do
about every other man's in the valley. I know their shames and their
business grafts. In fact I know everything but the best side of 'em.
I've been in the saloon business in this valley for twenty years, Mr.
Dennis."

"Ah!" said Uncle Denny. "I understand now!"

"All I've got to do," said Murphy, "is to drop in on Fleckenstein and
mention this letter and suggest that my own information is what you
might call detailed. 'Twill be enough."

"Of course, it might not be Fleckenstein," said Dennis.

"Never mind! My warning will reach the proper party, if I go to
Fleckenstein," said Murphy. He smacked his lips over the cup of coffee
Mrs. Flynn set before him.

"And how came you to be helping the Boss instead of distributing booze?"
asked Uncle Denny.

"I was about ready to quit, anyhow," said Murphy. "A man gets sick of
crooked deals if you give him time. And time was when a man could keep a
saloon in this section and still be the leading citizen and his wife
could hold up her head with the banker's wife. That time's gone. I've
been thinking for a long time of marrying and settling down. Then the
Boss cleaned me out." Murphy chuckled.

"How was that?" asked Dennis. Mrs. Flynn began to clear the table very
slowly.

"Well, this is the way of it," and Murphy told the story of his first
meeting with Jim. "I've seen him in action, you see," he concluded, "and
I'd be sorry for Fleckenstein if he crosses the Boss's path."

"Jim'll never trouble himself to kick the jackal!" said Uncle Denny.

"Huh! You don't know that boy. There was a look in his eye this
morning--God help Fleckenstein if he meets the Big Boss--but he'll avoid
the Boss like poison."

Uncle Denny shook his head. "What kind is Fleckenstein?"

"What kind of a man would be countenancing a letter like that?" 
"Hilltop's such a queer place! Not the least speck of steam in the houses!
If they had steam, you could go anywhere, if your throat _was_
sore! And I never saw anybody trim a church; and oh, Milly says they'll
have _beau_-tiful flowers, and crosses, and things! _I_ never saw
anybody trim _anything_--'cept a loaf of cake and flowers on a bonnet."

Foolish Flaxie, to stand there winking tears into her eyes!

_You_ would have known better; you would have gone into the nursery to
play with that lovely baby; but there were times, I am sorry to
say, when Flaxie really enjoyed being unhappy.

So now she stood still, rolling her little trouble over and over,
as boys roll a snowball, making it larger and larger, till presently it
was as big as a mountain.

"Auntie _said_ I might go, and then she wouldn't lemme! Made me stay at
home to play with that ole baby! He's squirmy and wigglesome; what do
I want to play with _him_ for, when she _said_ I might go? I like good
aunties; I don't like the kind that tell lies.

"Oh, my throat _is_ growing sore, and I'm going off up-stairs to
stay in the cold, and get sick, 'cause they ought to keep steam;
and _then_ I guess auntie'll be sorry!"

I grieve to tell you this about Flaxie, for I fear you will not like a
little girl who could be so very naughty.

When the happy party of church-trimmers came home at tea-time, there she
was up-stairs in the "doleful dumps;" and it was a long while
before Milly could coax her down.

When she came at last, her face was a sight to behold--all purple, and
spotted, and striped; for a fit of crying always gave her the appearance
of measles.

She consented to take a seat at table, but ate little, said nothing, and
gazed mournfully at her plate.

This distressed Aunt Charlotte, but she asked no questions, and tried to
keep Johnny talking, so he would not notice his afflicted little
cousin.

"Now what _does_ make you act so?" asked Milly, as soon as tea was
over.

"'Got a _cricket_ in my neck; Can't move it a single speck,'"
replied Flaxie, not knowing she had made poetry, till Johnny,
who was supposed to be ever so far off, began to laugh; and then she
moved her neck fast enough, and shook her head, and stamped her
foot.

"Let's go in the nursery, so Johnny can't plague you," said the
peace-loving Milly. "I'm so sorry you're sick."
Flaxie had not meant to speak, but she could not help talking to
Milly.

"Wish I'se at home," said she, reproachfully, "'cause my mamma keeps
pepmint."

"Why, Flaxie, my mamma keeps it too. We've got lots and lots of it
in the cupboard."

"Don't care if you have," snapped Flaxie. "I just despise pepmint. It's
something else I want, and can't think of the name of; but I know you
don't keep it, for your papa isn't a doctor!"
It was not the first time Flaxie had wounded her sweet cousin's
feelings by this same cutting remark.

"Dr. Papa keeps _tittlish_ powders in blue and white papers, and one of
the papers _buzzes_.

I guess he'd give me that, but I don't know," added Flaxie, crying
again harder than ever, though the tears fell like fire on her poor,
sore cheeks.

CHAPTER VIII.

A CRAZY CHRISTMAS.

"You dear little thing," said Aunt Charlotte, coming into the room with
Ken in her arms, but putting him down and taking up her naughty
niece.

"You've been getting homesick all by yourself this long afternoon.

Where did you stay?"
"Stayed up-sta--irs," sobbed Flaxie.

"In the cold? Why, darling, what made you?"
"You all went off and left me," replied Flaxie, with a little tempest
of tears.

Then auntie understood it all,--how this child, who was old enough to know
better, had been rolling a little bit of a trouble over and over,
till it had grown into a mountain and almost crushed her.

And the mother-heart in Aunt Charlotte's bosom ached for poor foolish
Flaxie.

"She has added to her cold, and is feverish," thought the good lady,
sending for Nancy to bring some hot water in the tin bath-tub that
was used for washing the children.

"I shall have you sleep with me to-night, in the down-stairs room," said
Aunt Charlotte; "and I'll put a flannel round your neck, dear, and
some poultices on your feet."

Flaxie smiled faintly as she saw the dried burdock-leaves soaking in
vinegar, for she liked to have a suitable parade made over her
when she was sick.

Besides, she had often thought she should enjoy sleeping in the "down-stairs
room," and was glad now that Uncle Ben happened to be gone; that
is, as glad as she could be of anything.

It was a miserable, forlorn world all of a sudden to Flaxie, and she had
never known such "a mean old night," even if it was "the night before
Christmas."

The lamp burning dimly in the corner of the room, on the floor, cast shadows
that frightened her; her head ached; she woke the baby in the crib
by crying, and then he woke everybody else.

It was a "mean old night" to the whole house; and when I say the _whole_
house, I mean both halves of it. About midnight, as Mrs. Hunter was
sleeping sweetly, her door-bell rang a furious peal. Nobody likes to
hear such a sound at dead of night, and Mrs. Hunter trembled a little,
for she was all alone with her children; but she rose and dressed
as fast as possible, and went down-stairs with a lamp.

"Who is it?" she asked, through the keyhole.

"It's ME!" said a childish voice that she thought sounded like one of
the Allen children.

She ventured to open the door, and there on the steps in the darkness
stood Flaxie Frizzle, bareheaded, shivering, and looking terribly
frightened.

"Oh, Mrs.

Hunter, something _orful_ has happened at our house.

Oh, come quick, Mrs. Hunter!"
"Yes, yes, dear, I'll go this minute; but what is it?" said the lady,
hurrying to the entry closet for her shawl.

"Auntie is crazy!

She is running round and round with the tea-kettle."
Mrs. Hunter stood still with amazement.

"Who sent _you_ here?" said she. "Why don't they call the doctor?"
"I don't know. She's going to scald me to death, and I s'pose you know I'm
sick," whined Flaxie, sinking down on the doormat, where the light
of the lamp shone full upon her, and Mrs. Hunter saw--what she might have
seen before, if she had not been so nervous--that the little girl wore
a checked flannel nightie, and her feet were done up in poultices.

Of course she must have come away without any one's knowing it,
that cold night, with the snow falling too!

It was she that was crazy, instead of Aunt Charlotte.

"How could the child have got out of the house?" thought Mrs. Hunter.

But the question was now, how to get her back again?

"Come, Flaxie," said she, in a soothing tone, "let me wrap you up in a
shawl and take you home pickaback,--there's a good girl!"

"But I don't want auntie to scald me."
"She shan't, dear. If she has got the tea-kettle, I'll take it away
from her."
"Honest?" asked Flaxie, piteously.

But she forgot her terror as soon as she was mounted pickaback, and
thought herself the "country cousin" taking a ride on a holder.

All this while everybody in the Allen half of the house was up and hunting
for the lost child. Milly was crying bitterly; Johnny had come in from
the barn, where he had pulled the hay all over; and Uncle Ben, who had
just returned from his journey, was starting out on the street
with a lantern.

Just then Mrs. Hunter walked in, and dropped Flaxie into Aunt
Charlotte's arms, saying:

"Here, I've brought you a poor sick child."
Then there was such a commotion that Flaxie was more bewildered
than ever, and at sight of Uncle Ben she screamed wildly.

It was his coming home about ten minutes before that had frightened her,
in the first place, by waking her from a bad dream; and she had
slipped out of bed, and out of the open front door, before any one
missed her.

"There! there!

darling, don't cry," said Aunt Charlotte, hushing her in her arms,
while Mrs.

Hunter heated a blanket.

     "I've done something _orful_," said Flaxie in her auntie's
     ear. "I'm so sorry; but I stole a horse and sleigh! _Don't_
     tell, auntie!

                                          I put 'em behind that door."

"Well, never mind it, dear; you didn't mean to," said Aunt Charlotte,
smiling in spite of her heavy heart.

Then she turned to Uncle Ben, who stood by, looking puzzled, and asked
him in a whisper if he "didn't think he ought to go for the doctor"?

"Oh, by all means," said Mrs. Hunter, beginning to help him on with his
overcoat.

He had hurried home in the night train, on purpose to spend Christmas
day with his family, and was really too tired to take a ride of two
miles in a snow-storm.

But he was not thinking of that; he was thinking how dreadful it
was to have his dear little niece sick away from home; and how her
papa didn't like the Hilltop doctor,--and perhaps it was best to
go three miles farther to the next town after Dr.

Pulsifer.

"Yes, go for Dr.

Pulsifer," said Aunt Charlotte, when he asked her about it; "and be as
quick as you can."
Flaxie knew nothing of all this. Her cheeks burned, her eyes shone, and
she kept saying there were a million lions and tigers in the bed; and
where was the rat-trap?

"Do bring the rat-trap!" said she, plunging about in a fright. "Oh, you
don't hear, do you? There's a woman out in the other room eating
peas,--eating, and eating, and eating. Why don't you stop her? Oh, you
don't hear!

Johnny Allen, run for a sponge and vinegar, and put it in auntie's ears,
so she can hear!"
Milly laughed at these strange speeches till she heard Nancy say
to Mrs.

Hunter, "Crazy as a loon, ain't she? I'm afraid it's water on the brain."

Then Milly, who did not understand Nancy's meaning, but was appalled by
the tone, ran into the pantry, and cried behind the flour-barrel.

"If Flaxie Frizzle dies, I want to die too! She's the only twin cousin
I've got in the world."
In a short time, considering how far he had ridden, Uncle Ben came
home, but without Dr.

Pulsifer, who had gone away, and could not be there before to-morrow
noon.

"I'm so disappointed," said Aunt Charlotte, looking pale and ill
enough herself to be in bed.

"But the poor little thing is asleep now, and perhaps she isn't so
very sick after all. Do tell me if you think there's any danger
of brain-fever?"

"Well, I think this," replied Uncle Ben, leaning over the bed and taking
a long look at the little patient; "_I_ don't know what ails her! It
may be diphtheria, and then again it may be common sore throat; but
if she isn't better in the morning, we'll telegraph to her father,
for a child that can turn yellow and pea-green, as she did last
spring, is capable of almost anything."

"That is true," said Aunt Charlotte; "one never knows what she is going
to do next." And then she looked at Flaxie, and sighed. It was wonderful
what a power she had of keeping her friends in a worry, this little
pink and white slip of a girl!

Once she had fallen into a brook, and once into a well, beside falling
sick times without number.

Uncle Ben and Aunt Charlotte knew all this, but they did not happen to
know that it was a very common thing for Flaxie to be crazy! It was just
so with her brother Preston and her sister Ninny; they seldom had any
little ailment like a bad cold without "going out of their heads," and
nobody in the family minded it at all.

If Flaxie's mother had been at Hilltop, she would have sent Uncle
Ben and Aunt Charlotte to bed; but as she was not there, and they
didn't know any better, they sat up all night watching their queer
little niece.

Rather a sorry "Christmas eve" all around the house,--but a beautiful
Christmas morning, and not a cloud in the sky. Flaxie woke as gay as a
bird, without the least recollection of the horrors she had suffered
in the night from tigers and tea-kettles.

"Wish you merry Christmas!" cried she to pale Aunt Charlotte, and sprang
out of bed with poultices on her feet to go after her Christmas
stocking.

"Well, is this the little girl they thought was so sick," said Dr.
Pulsifer, when he arrived at noon, and found her and Milly lying on
the rug, with a pair of twin dolls between them dressed just alike,
and each with a fur cap on its head.

He felt Flaxie's pulse and looked at her tongue, and said he "shouldn't
waste any of his nice medicine on _her_."
"But my cold isn't good at all, now honest; and my throat's a little
sore--I guess," said Flaxie, drawing a long face, and feeling rather
ashamed not to be sick now, when the doctor had been sent for on
purpose!

"Never mind! If you don't need me, your aunt does. What do you think
of yourself, you little piece of mischief, running away in the night,
and frightening people so that they are sick abed Christmas day?"
All Flaxie's good time was over in a minute. _Was_ auntie sick abed
up-stairs? Was that why Flaxie hadn't seen her since morning?

"Oh, mayn't I go look at her?" said she, after the doctor had left. And
Uncle Ben consented, thinking she wouldn't stay a minute.

"Oh, I'm so sorry! I do love you dearly," cried penitent Flaxie,
climbing upon the bed and cuddling close to the white auntie.

"_Did_ I make you sick? I didn't mean to; and I don't 'member anything
about the tea-kettle."

"There, there, dear, don't cry."
"I oughtn't to stayed up-stairs yesterday in the cold," went on Flaxie,
determined to free her mind. "That was the wickedest thing! But you
were just as good as you could be, if you _did_ trim the church;
and I'll never do so again!"
"Oh, hush, dear; you shake the bed."
"I'm real bad in here, in my s-o-ul!" wailed Flaxie, squeezing her
eyelids together tight, and laying her hand on her stomach. "Why
don't God make me beautiful inside o' my soul?"
"Ask Him, dear child!"
"Will He?" said Flaxie, earnestly. "Oh, yes, I know;" and her eager
face fell. "But He'll have to make me homely to do it, just like
Miss Pike." 
"Oh, no, my darling."
"Won't He? See what a orful cole-sore I've got on my mouth. If it
would stay there, and stick on always, do you s'pose I'd grow good?"
asked Flaxie, thoughtfully.

Aunt Charlotte almost smiled.
"'Cause I'm willing to be a little homely,--now truly--if I can
have a nice so-o-ul," added the child, with a true and deep feeling
of her own naughtiness that I am sure the angels must have been
glad to see.
But she was shaking the bed again, and Uncle Ben drew her gently
away, and took her down stairs in his arms to finish the rest of
her "crazy Christmas." 

CHAPTER IX.

MILLY VISITING.
Winter passed, spring came, and April was half over before the twin
cousins met again. Then it was Milly's turn to go to Laurel Grove
to see Flaxie. She had written a postal-card slowly, and with great
pains, to say "she should be there to-morrow if it was pleasant."

But how it did rain! It had rained for two days as if the sky meant
to pour itself away in tears; but on Wednesday the sun came rushing
through the clouds, his face all aglow with smiles, and put an end
to such dismal business. The rain ceased, the clouds scampered away
and hid themselves, and the sky cleared up as bright as if nothing
had ever been the matter.
Sweet little Milly looked out of the window, heard the birds sing,
and whispered in her heart:
"Oh, how kind God is to give me a good day to go to Laurel Grove!"

She didn't own a pretty valise of brown canvas with leather straps
like Flaxie's. All in the world she had was an old bandbox trunk
that belonged to her mother, and she took no care of that, for Milly
never "travelled alone."
"Well, little sobersides," said her father, putting the check in
his pocket, the ticket in his hat, and opening a car-window before
he sat down beside Milly.Pen did not speak for some time and Jim did not disturb her. She looked
back at the Elephant as long as she could discern the great meditative
form in the starlight. Then, after they had gotten into the hills and
were winging like night birds up the mountain road, Jim felt a cold
little hand slip into his lean, warm paw.

Jim's heart gave a thud. He leaned forward to look into Pen's face. It
was dim in the starlight, but he saw that she smiled slightly. Jim
leaned back, feeling as if he could overturn worlds with this thrill in
his veins.

The great road curled like a hair among the dim black mountain tops. The
machine flew lightly. Uncle Denny and Henderson talked quietly, and at
last, under cover of their speech and the whirr of the engine, Pen began
to talk softly to Jim.

"I am hoping that in the years to come I can remember Sara as a college
boy, so full of life and ambition! He was a beautiful boy, Still, wasn't
he?"

"Yes, little Pen, I loved him very much, then."

"Life was unfair to him to give him a greater burden than he was
designed to bear," said Pen. "I shall miss the care of him. I am going
to miss the demands he made on my best spiritual effort. I'm going to
sag like a fiddle string released. If only he has gone on now to a
better chance! Poor, poor tortured Sara!"

Jim rubbed the little twitching fingers and Pen leaned against his
shoulder softly as though she needed his nearness to steady her. She
went on a little brokenly:

    "'Envy and calumny and hate and pain
    And that unrest which men miscall delight
    Can touch him not and torture not again----'

"I guess I won't get over the scarring, Still. I'm so tired."

"You've the priceless gift of youth, dear Penny," said Jim softly. "Go
and play, sweetheart."

There was a long silence. Dawn was marching on the mountain tops.
Penelope watched the silver glory of the star-studded sky and she said
in a steadier tone:

    "'Life like a dome of many colored glass
    Stains the white radiance of Eternity
    Until death tramples it to fragments----'"

A sudden scarlet revealed itself on a far peak. It was like a marvelous
translucent ruby, set in a silver mist.

Uncle Denny turned. "Henderson says we are right on the railroad."

"We are," replied Jim, "and yonder is the train."

The automobile drew into the station with the train and Uncle Denny,
with Henderson, helped embark poor Sara on his last ride, while Jim put
Pen aboard the train. Pen followed Jim back onto the train platform. Jim
shook hands with her and stood on the lower step waiting for the train
to start. His face in the dawn light was very wistful. Suddenly Pen's
lips quivered. Just as the train began to move, "Jim!" she whispered.
And she leaned over and caught his face between her hands and kissed him
quickly on the lips. Then she slipped into the coach. Jim dropped off
the train and stood staring unseeingly at Uncle Denny and Henderson. A
to-hee sang its morning song from a nearby cactus:

    "O yahee! O yahai!
    Sweet as arrow weed in spring!"

"Put your hat on, me boy," said Uncle Denny, who had not seen the little
episode, "and come on." He led the way to the machine and climbed in
beside Jim. "Well, Still, she's gone!"

Jim turned and looked at his Uncle Denny. "She's not gone for long. When
I have finished the Project fight I shall go after her."

"Did she agree?" asked Uncle Denny eagerly.

"No," said Jim serenely. "She's in the frame of mind that's to be
expected after the life she's lived with Sara. She is afraid of
everything. After the election, I shall go to her. She and I have missed
enough of each other."

Dennis brought his fist down on his knee. "Then that's settled right,
thank God!" he said to the dawn at large.

The next day Mrs. Ames came up to the dam. She was inconsolable that she
had not been sent for, to help Pen and Mrs. Flynn's air of superiority
was not soothing. Uncle Denny took to Mrs. Ames at once.

"I've done nothing but gad for Mr. Manning, lately," she said.

"How are things going?" asked Mrs. Flynn. "Has Bill Evans got all the
money yet?"

"Eh? What's this?" exclaimed Uncle Denny.

"Mrs. Pen thought it would do a lot of good if we could get the
farmers' wives to working against Fleckenstein," said Jane. "I've been
calling on a lot of them. Bill Evans takes me in his auto."

"Who pays Bill?" asked Uncle Denny. "Ames?"

"He does not, though he honestly offered to," said Jane. "This is a
woman's job. Mrs. Flynn is paying for it. And don't you tell Mr.
Manning. So far he hasn't asked any questions. Oscar says he's too
worried over other things."

"Bless us!" cried Uncle Denny. "That won't do! You must let me
straighten it up."

Mrs. Flynn rapped on the table with the dripping mixing spoon with which
she had followed Jane in from the kitchen. "Michael Dennis! You will
not! What's me money for if it ain't for him? Ain't he all I've got in
the wide world and you grutch me that? God knows I never thought I'd
come to this to be told I couldn't do for him! If God lets me live to
spare my life I hope to spend every cent I've got back on the Boss."

Uncle Denny nodded. "All right! You're a good woman, Mrs. Flynn. How is
your campaign going, Mrs. Ames?"

Jane shook her head. "You never know which way a woman will jump. If
only Fleckenstein can be beaten, it will be Mr. Manning's personality
that beats him, and after that he can do whatever he wants to with the
valley. But the election is only a little way off and I'm scared to
death. I've talked and visited until I'm ashamed of myself. And there's
only one woman in the valley I'm sure of."

"Who is she?" asked Uncle Denny.

"That's Mrs. Cady, a rich widow who lives near Cabillo. She's the
terror of the valley. She's a scold and she holds half the mortgages in
the county. She stopped Mr. Manning a while ago and asked what he meant
by running one of the canals the way it was. Then, just because he's
always nice to a woman, Mr. Manning stands and lets her explain his
business to him for half an hour. When she got through he thanked her
and said it was always wise to trust a woman's intuition. She thought
she'd taught him a real valuable lesson and she said he was the only man
she ever saw that knew good advice when he got it. Well, when I went
round to her the other day and told her what Mr. Manning was up against,
she flew round like a wet hen. I've heard she threatened to foreclose on
anyone that voted for Fleckenstein."

Uncle Denny chuckled. "And the boy thinks he has no friends!"

The fight into which Jim had thrown himself was an intangible one. He
knew that he could not save his job for himself, but he believed that if
he could defeat Fleckenstein, he would have made the farmers assume a
responsibility for the Project that would never be lost.

Uncle Denny did not tell Jim that he knew that every day lessened Jim's
term of office on the dam. He asked no embarrassing questions. One day,
as they stood looking at the dam slowly emerging from the river bed to
lie in the utter beauty of strength at the Elephant's feet, Jim said:

"I wonder if another man will love the dam as I have. There is not a
stone in it that I don't know and care for."

But Uncle Denny only nodded and said in reply, "A man must love the
thing he creates whether it's a dam or a child." But his heart ached
within him.

The Department of Agriculture had responded immediately and half a dozen
experts already were at work on the Project. The older farmers resented
any suggestions that were made regarding their methods, but little by
little the newcomers were turning to the experts, and Jim believed that
even in a year scientific farming would be a settled fact on the
Project.

Every moment that Jim could spare from hastening the work on the dam he
spent in the valley with the farmers. He did not harangue. He had come
to realize that deep within us all dwells a hunger of the soul on which,
when roused, the world wings forward. So he induced these men to talk to
him and listened, wondering at the deeps he touched. He did not realize
that often they were ashamed to show him narrowness or selfishness when
through his wistful silence they glimpsed his unsatisfied visioning.
Nothing in life is so contagious as a great dream.

As far as the Project was concerned, the story of Jim's alleged
interview with Freet made little impression, after all. Insinuations and
accusations had appeared so often about the engineers of the dam in the
local papers that they had ceased to be a sensation. In the East,
though, Jim knew the story would leave its permanent imprint. Murphy
interviewed Fleckenstein and never would tell what he and the politician
said to each other. But the threat of the letter never was carried out.
Fleckenstein continued a vigorous campaign, however. Money and whiskey
flowed freely and Fleckenstein saw every man that Jim saw.

Uncle Denny was only temporarily dismayed by Jim's refusal to allow him
to work openly against Fleckenstein. Mrs. Ames, having come to the end
of her talking capacity, he hired Bill Evans and his machine for the
remaining six weeks of the campaign. Bill was quite willing to let the
hogs go hungry while he and his machine were in demand.

Uncle Denny said: "A twenty-mile ride in Bill's tonneau is better as a
flesh reducer than ten hours in a Turkish bath. It is the truth when I
tell folks I'm riding for me health."

Uncle Denny made himself newsgetter-in-chief for Jim. He scoured the
valley for reports on the state of mind of every water user and business
man on the Project. Oscar and Murphy, when not with Jim, devoted
themselves to Uncle Denny. Both the men were frankly giving all their
time to the Project these days.

The weeks sped by all too rapidly. One evening Uncle Denny called a
conference at Jim's house. Jim, coming home from the office at ten
o'clock that night, found Murphy and Henderson and Oscar awaiting him
with Uncle Denny as master of ceremonies.

"Me boy," said Uncle Denny, "there's going to be a landslide for
Fleckenstein."

Jim nodded. "I think so. Well, anyhow, I've made one or two friends
below who'll remember after I'm gone some of the things I've wanted for
the Project."

Uncle Denny, standing before the grate, looked at Jim in a troubled way.
The Big Boss, as he loved to call Jim, was looking very tired.

"Well," said Murphy, "Fleckenstein can't make much trouble for a year.
Even after he takes his seat it will take time to start things even with
the money from the Trust. And in the meantime the Big Boss will be able
to put up a great counter-irritant out here if what he's done the last
few weeks is any sample."

Jim lighted his pipe and leaned back in his chair. "I won't be here,
boys," he said. "This is confidential. I have been asked for my
resignation and it takes effect the day after election."

There was utter silence in the room for a moment, then Henderson leaned
forward and spat past Uncle Denny into the grate.

"Hell's fire!" he said gently.

"How long have you known this, Boss?" asked Murphy.

"Nearly three months," answered Jim.

"Pen told me," said Dennis. "Suma-theek told her."

Jim looked up in astonishment, then he shook his head. "I'm sorry Pen
has that to bother her, too."

What I call Anglicanism. It's a form of idealism. It consists in doing
the proper thing." "But why should the proper thing be done?" "That
question ought not to be asked. Anglicanism is an idealistic creed. It
is anti-utilitarian and anti-rational. It does not ask questions;
it has faith.

The proper thing is the proper thing, and because it is the proper thing
it is done." "At least," he said, "you do not pretend that this
is religion?"

"No. It has nothing to do with religion. But neither is it, as you too
simply suppose, hypocrisy.

Hypocrisy implies that you know what religion is, and counterfeit it.
But these people do not know, and they are not counterfeiting.

When they go to church they are not thinking of religion. They are
thinking of the social system.

The officers and civilians singing up there first learned to sing
in the village church.

They walked to the church from the great house; the great house
stood in its park; the park was enclosed by the estate; and the
estate was surrounded by other estates.

     The service in the village church stood for all that. And
     the service in the saloon stands for it still. At bottom,
     what that hymn means is not that these men are Christians, but
that they are carrying England to India, to Burma, to China."

                                          "It is a funny thing," the Frenchman mused, "to carry to 300 million
Hindus and Mahometans, and 400 million Confucians, Buddhists, and
devil-worshippers.

What do they do with it when they get there?" "They plant it down in
little oases all over the country, and live in it. It is the shell that
protects them in those oceans of impropriety.
And from that shell they govern the world." "But how can they govern
what they can't even see?" "They govern all the better. If once they
could see, they would be lost. Doubt would enter in. And it is
the virtue of the Englishman that he never doubts. That is what the
system does for him."
At this moment a voice was borne down the breeze. It was that of my
travelling companion, and it appeared, as he approached, that he was
discoursing to the captain on the merits of Dostoievsky's novels. He
is no respecter of persons; he imposes his own conversation; and
the captain, though obviously puzzled, was polite.

"Russians may be like that," he was remarking as he passed, "but
Englishmen aren't." "No," said my friend, "but don't you wish they
were?"

"I do _not_," said the captain with conviction. I looked at the Frenchman.
"There," I said, "behold the system." "But your friend?" "Ah, but he,
like myself, is a pariah. Have you not observed?

They are quite polite. They have even a kind of respect--such as our public
school boys have--for anyone who is queer, if only he is queer enough.
But we don't "belong," and they know it. We are outside the system. At
bottom we are dangerous, like foreigners.

And they don't quite approve of our being let loose in India."

"Besides, you talk to the Indians." "Yes, we talk to the Indians." "And
that is contrary to the system?"

"Yes, on board the boat; it's all very well while you're still in England."
"A strange system--to perpetuate between rulers and ruled an impassable
gulf!" "Yes. But, as Mr. Podsnap remarked, 'so it is.'"
We had penetrated to the bows of the ship and hung looking over.
Suddenly, just under the surf, there was an emerald gleam; another;
then a leap and a dive; a leap and a dive again. A pair of porpoises were
playing round the bows with the ease, the spontaneity, the beauty of
perfect and happy life. As we watched them the same mood grew in us
till it forced expression. And "Oh," I said, "the ship's a prison!"
"No," said the Frenchman, "it's the system."

II
AJANTA

A dusty road running through an avenue across the great plateau of the
Deccan; scanty crops of maize and cotton; here and there low hills,
their reddish soil sparsely clothed with trees; to the north, a
receding line of mountains; elsewhere infinite space and blazing
light.

Our "tonga," its pair of wheels and its white awning rolling and
jolting behind two good horses, passes long lines of bullock-carts.

Indians, walking beside them with their inimitable gait, make
exquisite gestures of abjection to the clumsy white Sahibs huddled
uncomfortably on the back seat.

Their robes of vivid colour, always harmoniously blent, leave bare the
slender brown legs and often the breast and back.

Children stark naked ride on their mothers' hips or their fathers' shoulder.
Now and again the oxen are unyoked at a dribble of water, and a
party rests and eats in the shade.

Otherwise it is one long march with bare feet over the burning soil.

We are approaching a market. The mud walls of a village appear. And
outside, by a stream shrunk now into muddy pools, shimmers and wimmers
a many-coloured crowd, buzzing among their waggons and awnings and
improvised stalls.

We ford the shallow stream, where women are washing clothes, cleaning their
teeth, and drinking from the same water, and pass among the bags of corn,
the sugar-cane, and sweetmeats, saluted gravely but unsolicited.

Then on again for hours, the road now solitary, till as day closes
we reach Fardapur.

A cluster of mud-walled compounds and beehive huts lies about a fortified
enclosure, where the children sprawl and scream, and a Brahmin intones
to silent auditors. Outside they are drawing water from the puddles of
the stream.

And gradually over the low hills and the stretches of yellow grass the
after-glow spreads a transfiguring light.
Out of a rosy flush the evening star begins to shine; the crickets
cry; a fresh breeze blows; and another pitiless day drops into
oblivion.

Next day, at dawn, we walk the four miles to the famous caves, guided by
a boy who wears the Nizam's livery, and explains to us, in a language
we do not know, but with perfect lucidity, that it is to him, and no one
else, that backsheesh is due.

He sings snatches of music as old and strange as the hills; picks us
balls of cotton, and prickly pear; and once stops to point to the
fresh tracks of a panther. We are in the winding gorge of a watercourse;
and presently, at a turn, in a semicircle facing south, we see in
the cliff the long line of caves. As we enter the first an intolerable
odour meets us, and a flight of bats explains the cause.

Gradually our eyes accustom themselves to the light, and we become conscious
of a square hall, the flat roof resting on squat pillars elaborately
carved, fragments of painting on the walls and ceiling, narrow
slits opening into dark cells, and opposite the entrance, set back
in a shrine, a colossal Buddha, the light falling full on the solemn
face, the upturned feet, the expository hands.

This is a monastery, and most of the caves are on the same plan; but one
or two are long halls, presumably for worship, with barrel-vaulted
roofs, and at the end a great solid globe on a pedestal.

Of the art of these caves I will not speak. What little can be seen
of the painting--and only ill-lighted fragments remain--is full
of tenderness, refinement, and grace; no touch of drama; no hint
of passion.

The sculpture, stripped of its stucco surface, is rude but often
impressive.

But what impresses most is not the art but the religion of the place.
In this terrible country, where the great forces of nature, drought and
famine and pestilence, the intolerable sun, the intolerable rain, and the
exuberance of life and death, have made of mankind a mere passive
horde cowering before inscrutable Powers--here, more than anywhere,
men were bound under a yoke of observance and ritual to the gods
they had fashioned and the priests who interpreted their will.

Then came the Deliverer to set them free not _for_ but _from_ life,
teaching them how to escape from that worst of all evils, rebirth
again and again into a world of infinite suffering, unguided by any
reason to any good end.

"There is no god," said this strange master, "there is no soul; but
there is life after death, life here in this hell, unless you will
learn to deliver yourselves by annihilating desire."

They listened; they built monasteries; they meditated; and now and
again, here, perhaps, in these caves, one or other attained enlightenment.
But the cloud of Hinduism, lifted for a moment, rolled back heavier
than ever.

The older gods were seated too firmly on their thrones.

Shiva--creator, preserver, destroyer--expelled the Buddha. And that passive
figure, sublime in its power of mind, sits for ever alone in the
land of his birth, exiled from light, in a cloud of clinging bats.

But outside proceeds the great pageant of day and night, and the patient,
beautiful people labour without hope, while universal nature, symbolised
by Shiva's foot, presses heavily on their heads and forbids them
the stature of man.

Only the white man here, bustling, ungainly, aggressive, retains his
freedom and acts rather than suffers. One understands at last the
full meaning of the word "environment." Because of this sun, because
of this soil, because of their vast numbers, these people are
passive, religious, fatalistic.

Because of our cold and rain in the north, our fresh springs and summers,
we are men of action, of science, of no reflection. The seed is the
same, but according to the soil it brings forth differently.

Here the patience, the beauty, the abjection before the Devilish-Divine;
there the defiance, the cult of the proud self.

And these things have met. To what result?

III
ULSTER IN INDIA

"Are you a Home Ruler?" "Yes. Are you?" Instantly a torrent of
protest.
He was a Mahometan, eminent in law and politics; clever, fluent, forensic,
with a passion for hearing himself talk, and addressing one always as
if one were a public meeting. He approached his face close to mine,
gradually backing me into the wall. And I realised the full meaning
of Carlyle's dictum "to be a mere passive bucket to be pumped into
can be agreeable to no human being."

It was not, naturally, the Irish question for its own sake that interested
him. But he took it as a type of the Indian question. Here, too, he
maintained, there is an Ulster, the Mahometan community. Here,
too, there are Nationalists, the Hindus.

Here, too, a "loyal" minority, protected by a beneficent and impartial
Imperial Government.

Here, too, a majority of "rebels" bent on throwing off that Government
in order that they may oppress the minority.

Here, too, an ideal of independence hypocritically masked under the
phrase "self-government."

"It is a law of political science that where there are two minorities
they should stand together against the majority.

The Hindus want to get rid of you, as they want to get rid of us.

And for that reason alone, if there were not a thousand others"--there
were, he hinted, but, rhetorically, he "passed them over in silence"--"for
that reason alone I am loyal to the British raj." It had never occurred
to me to doubt it. But I questioned, when I got a moment's breathing
space, whether really the Hindu community deliberately nourished this
dark conspiracy.

He had no doubt, so far as the leaders were concerned; and he mistrusted
the "moderates" more than the extremists, because they were cleverer.
He "multiplied examples"--it was his phrase. The movement for primary
education, for example.

It had nothing to do with education. It was a plot to teach the masses
Hindi, in order that they might be swept into the anti-British, anti-Mahometan
current. As to minor matters, no Hindu had ever voted for a Mahometan,
no Hindu barrister ever sent a client to a Mahometan colleague. Whereas
in all these matters, one was led to infer, Mahometans were
conciliation and tolerance itself. I knew that the speaker himself had
secured the election of Mahometans to all the seats in the Council. But
I refrained from referring to the matter.

Then there was caste. A Hindu will not eat with a Mahometan, and this
was taken as a personal insult. I suggested that the English were equally
boycotted; but that we regarded the boycott as a religious obligation,
not as a social stigma.

But, like the Irish Ulstermen, he was not there to listen to argument.
He rolled on like a river. None of us could escape. He detected
the first signs of straying, and beckoned us back to the flock.
"Mr. Audubon, this is important." "Mr. Coryat, you must listen to this."
Coryat, at last, grew restive, and remarked rather tartly that no
doubt there was friction between the two communities, but that the
worst way to deal with it was by recrimination. He agreed; with
tears in his eyes he agreed.

There was nothing he had not done, no advance he had not made, to endeavour
to bridge the gulf. All in vain! Never were such obstinate fellows as
these Hindus. And he proceeded once more to "multiply examples." As we
said "Good-bye" in the small hours of the morning he pressed into our
hands copies of his speeches and addresses.
And we left him perorating on the steps of the hotel.

A painfully acquired mistrust of generalisation prevents me from
saying that this is _the_ Mahometan point of view.

Indeed, I have reason to know that it is not. But it is a Mahometan
point of view in one province.

And it was endorsed, more soberly, by less rhetorical members of the
community. Some twenty-five years ago, they say, Mahometans woke to the
fact that they were dropping behind in the race for influence and
power.

They started a campaign of education and organisation. At every point
they found themselves thwarted; and always, behind the obstacle, lurked
a Hindu.

Lord Morley's reform of the Councils, intended to unite all sections,
had had the opposite effect. Nothing but the separate electorates had
saved Mahometans from political extinction. And precisely because
they desired that extinction Hindus desired mixed electorates.

The elections to the Councils have exasperated the antagonism between
the two communities. And an enemy might accuse the Government of being
actuated, in that reform, by the Machiavellian maxim "Divide et
impera."
What the Hindus have to say to all this I have not had an opportunity of
learning. But they too, I conceive, can "multiply examples" for
their side.

To a philosophic observer two reflections suggest themselves.
One, that representative government can only work when there is real
give and take between the contending parties. The other, that to most
men, and most nations, religion means nothing more than antagonism to
some other religion. Witness Ulster in Ireland; and witness, equally,
Ulster in India.

IV
ANGLO-INDIA
From the gallery of the high hall we look down on the assembled
society of the cantonment.

The scene is commonplace enough; twaddle and tea, after tennis;
"frivolling"--it is their word; women too empty-headed and men too
tired to do anything else.

This mill-round of work and exercise is maintained like a religion. The
gymkhana represents the "compulsory games" of a public school. It
is part of the "white man's burden."

He plays, as he works, with a sense of responsibility. He is bored, but
boredom is a duty, and there's nothing else to do.

The scene is commonplace. Yes! But this afternoon a band is playing. The
music suits the occasion. It is soft, melodious, sentimental.
It provokes a vague sensibility, and makes no appeal to the
imagination.

At least it should not, from its quality. But the power of music
is incalculable.

It has an essence independent of its forms. And by virtue of that essence
its poorest manifestations can sink a shaft into the springs of
life.

So as I listen languidly the scene before me detaches itself from
actuality and floats away on the stream of art. It becomes a symbol; and
around and beyond it, in some ideal space, other symbols arise and begin
to move.

I see the East as an infinite procession. Huge Bactrian camels balance
their bobbing heads as they pad deliberately over the burning dust.
Laden asses, cattle, and sheep and goats move on in troops. Black-bearded
men, men with beard and hair dyed red, women pregnant or carrying
babies on their hips, youths like the Indian Bacchus with long
curling hair, children of all ages, old men magnificent and fierce,
all the generations of Asia pass and pass on, seen like a frieze
against a rock background, blazing with colour, rhythmical and
fluent, marching menacingly down out of infinite space on to this
little oasis of Englishmen.

Then, suddenly, they are an ocean; and the Anglo-Indian world floats
upon it like an Atlantic liner. It has its gymnasium, its
swimming-bath, its card-rooms, its concert-room. It has its first and
second class and steerage, well marked off. It dresses for dinner
every night; it has an Anglican service on Sunday; it flirts mildly; it
is bored; but above all it is safe. It has water-tight compartments. It
is "unsinkable." The band is playing; and when the crash comes it will
not stop. No; it will play this music, this, which is in my ears. Is it
Gounod's "Faust" or an Anglican hymn?

No matter! It is the same thing, sentimental, and not imaginative. And
sentimentally, not imaginatively, the Englishman will die. He will not
face the event, but he will stand up to it. He will realise nothing,
but he will shrink from nothing. Of all the stories about the
loss of the _Titanic_ the best and most characteristic is that of
the group of men who sat conversing in the second-class smoking-room,
till one of them said, "Now she's going down.

Let's go and sit in the first-class saloon." And they did. How touching!
How sublime! How English! The _Titanic_ sinks. With a roar the machinery
crashes from stem to bow. Dust on the water, cries on the water, then
vacuity and silence. The East has swept over this colony of the West.
And still its generations pass on, rhythmically swinging; slaves
of Nature, not, as in the West, rebels against her; cyclical as her
seasons and her stars; infinite as her storms of dust; identical
as the leaves of her trees; purposeless as her cyclones and her
earthquakes.

The music stops and I rub my eyes. Yes, it is only the club, only tea
and twaddle! Or am I wrong? There is more in these men and women
than appears.

They stand for the West, for the energy of the world, for all, in this
vast Nature, that is determinate and purposive, not passively
repetitionary.

And if they do not know it, if they never hear the strain that transposes
them and their work into a tragic dream, if tennis is tennis to them,
and a valse a valse, and an Indian a native, none the less they are what
a poet would see them to be, an oasis in the desert, a liner on the
ocean, ministers of the life within life that is the hope, the
inspiration, and the meaning of the world.

In my heart of hearts I apologise as I prolong the banalities of parting,
and almost vow never again to abuse Gounod's music.

V
A MYSTERY PLAY

A few lamps set on the floor lit up the white roof. On either side the
great hall was open to the night; and now and again a bird flew across,
or a silent figure flitted from dark to dark. On a low platform sat the
dancers, gorgeously robed. All were boys. The leader, a peacock-fan
flashing in his head-dress, personated Krishna.

Beside him sat Rhada, his wife. The rest were the milkmaids of the legend.
They sat like statues, and none of them moved at our entry. But the
musicians, who were seated on the ground, rose and salaamed, and
instantly began to play.

There were five instruments--a miniature harmonium (terrible
innovation), two viols, of flat, unresonant tone, a pair of cymbals,
and a small drum.

The ear, at first, detected little but discordant chaos, but by degrees
a form became apparent--short phrases, of strong rhythm, in a different
scale from ours, repeated again and again, and strung on a thread of loose
improvisation. Every now and again the musicians burst into song. Their
voices were harsh and nasal, but their art was complicated and subtle.
Clearly, this was not barbarous music, it was only strange, and its
interest increased, as the ear became accustomed to it. Suddenly, as
though they could resist no longer, the dancers, who had not moved,
leapt from the platform and began their dance.

It was symbolical; Krishna was its centre, and the rest were wooing him.
Desire and its frustration and fulfilment were the theme.

Yet it was not sensual, or not merely so. The Hindus interpret in a
religious spirit this legendary sport of Krishna with the milkmaids.
It symbolises the soul's wooing of God. And so these boys interpreted
it. Their passion, though it included the flesh, was not of the flesh.
The mood was rapturous, but not abandoned; ecstatic, but not orgiastic.
There were moments of a hushed suspense when hardly a muscle
moved; only the arms undulated and the feet and hands vibrated.
Then a break into swift whirling, on the toes or on the knees, into
leaping and stamping, swift flight and pursuit.

A pause again; a slow march; a rush with twinkling feet; and always, on
those young faces, even in the moment of most excitement, a look
of solemn rapture, as though they were carried out of themselves
into the divine.

I have seen dancing more accomplished, more elaborate, more astonishing
than this.

But never any that seemed to me to fulfil so well the finest purposes
of the art.

The Russian ballet, in the retrospect, seems trivial by comparison. It
was secular; but this was religious. For the first time I seemed to
catch a glimpse of what the tragic dance of the Greeks might have been
like. The rhythms were not unlike those of Greek choruses, the motions
corresponded strictly to the rhythms, and all was attuned to a high
religious mood. In such dancing the flesh becomes spirit, the body a
transparent emblem of the soul.

After that the play, I confess, was a drop into bathos.

We descended to speech, even to tedious burlesque. But the analogy was
all the closer to mediæval mysteries. In ages of Faith religion is
not only sublime; it is intimate, humorous, domestic; it sits at the
hearth and plays in the nursery. So it is in India where the age of
Faith has never ceased. What was represented that night was an episode
in the story of Krishna. The characters were the infant god, his mother,
Jasodha, and an ancient Brahmin who has come from her own country to
congratulate her on the birth of a child. He is a comic character--the
sagging belly and the painted face of the pantomime.

He answers Jasodha's inquiries after friends and relations at home. She
offers him food. He professes to have no appetite, but, on being pressed,
demands portentous measures of rice and flour. While she collects the
material for his meal, he goes to bathe in the Jumna; and the whole
ritual of his ablutions is elaborately travestied, even a crocodile
being introduced in the person of one of the musicians, who rudely
pulls him by the leg as he is rolling in imaginary water.

His bathing finished, he retires and cooks his food.
When it is ready he falls into prayer. But during his abstraction the
infant Krishna crawls up and begins devouring the food. Returning to
himself, the Brahmin, in a rage, runs off into the darkness of the
hall.
Jasodha pursues him and brings him back. And he begins once more to cook
his food.

This episode was repeated three times in all its detail, and I confess
I found it insufferably tedious. The third time Jasodha scolds the child
and asks him why he does it.

He replies--and here comes the pretty point of the play--that the Brahmin,
in praying to God and offering him the food, unwittingly is praying to
him and offering to him, and in eating the food he has but accepted
the offering. The mother does not understand, but the Brahmin does, and
prostrates himself before his Lord.

This is crude enough art, but at any rate it is genuine. Like all
primitive art, it is a representation of what is traditionally believed
and popularly felt. The story is familiar to the audience and intimate
to their lives.

It represents details which they witness every day, and at the same time
it has religious significance. Out of it might grow a great drama, as
once in ancient Greece. And perhaps from no other origin can such a
drama arise.

VI
AN INDIAN SAINT

It was at Benares that we met him. He led us through the maze of the
bazaars, his purple robe guiding us like a star, and brought us out
by the mosque of Aurungzebe.

Thence a long flight of stairs plunged sheer to the Ganges, shining
below in the afternoon sun.

We descended; but, turning aside before we reached the shore, came
to a tiny house perched on a terrace above the ghat.

     We took off our shoes in the anteroom and passed through
     a second chamber, with its riverside open to the air, and
     reached a tiny apartment, where he motioned us to a divan.

                                          We squatted and looked round.

Some empty bottles were the only furniture.

But on the wall hung the picture we had come to see. It was a symbolic
tree, and perhaps as much like a tree as what it symbolised was like the
universe.
Embedded in its trunk and branches were coloured circles and signs,
and from them grew leaves and flowers of various hues.
For three days before the election Henderson scarcely slept. He tried to
be on all three shifts. "I even eat my meals from a nose bag," he told
Uncle Denny sadly.

"And what's a nose bag?" asked Uncle Denny.

"A nose bag is the thing you tie on a horse for him to get his grub
from. Also it's the long yellow bag the cook puts the night shift's
lunch in. But I'd starve if 'twould keep the Boss on the job. I'd even
drink one of Babe's cocktails."

Henderson waited for Uncle Denny's "Go ahead with the story," then he
began sadly:

"Algernon Dove was Babe's real name. He was an English remittance-man
here in the early days. The Smithsonian folks came down here and wanted
to get someone to go out with them to collect desert specimens,
rattlers, Gila monsters, hydrophobia skunks and such trash. Babe and
Alkali Ike, his running mate, went with them. They took a good outfit,
the Smithsonian folks did, and in one wagon they took a barrel of
alcohol and dumped the reptiles into it as fast as they found them. They
got a good bunch, little by little, snakes and horned toads and
hydrophobia skunks. In about two weeks they was ready to come back. Then
they noticed the bad smell."

Henderson paused. "What was the matter?" asked Uncle Denny.

"Babe and Ike had been drinking the alcohol, day by day," he answered in
his musical voice. "The barrel just did 'em two weeks. Just because I
talk foolish talk, Mr. Dennis, ain't a sign that I don't feel bad. I
don't want the Boss to speak to me or I'll cry."

The day of the election was a long one for Jim. He packed his trunk and
his personal papers and Mrs. Flynn began to wrap the legs of the chairs
in newspapers. Her tears threatened to reduce each wrapping to pulp
before she completed it. In the afternoon, Jim started for a last tour
of the dam. He covered the work slowly, looking his last at the details
over which he had toiled and dreamed so long. He walked slowly up from
the lower town. The men who passed him glanced away as if they would not
intrude on his trouble.

The work on the dam was going forward as though life and death depended
on the amount accomplished by this particular shift. Jim was
inexpressibly touched by this display of the men's good will, but he
could think of no way to show his feeling.

Just at sunset he climbed the Elephant's back. But he was not to have
this last call alone. Old Suma-theek was sitting on the edge of the
crater, his fine face turned hawklike toward the distance. Jim nodded to
his friend, then sat down in his favorite spot where, far across the
canyon, he could see the flag, rippling before the office.

After a time, the old Indian came over to sit beside him. He followed
Jim's gaze and said softly:

"That flag it heap pretty but wherever Injun see it he see sorrow and
death for Injun."

Jim answered slowly: "Perhaps we're being paid for what we've done to
you, Suma-theek. The white tribe that made the flag is going, just as we
have made you go. The flag will always look the same, but the dream it
was made to tell will go."

"Who sabez the way of the Great Spirit? He make you go. He make Injun
go. He make nigger and Chinamans stay. Perhaps they right, you and Injun
wrong. Who sabez?"

"I'd like to have finished my dam," Jim muttered. "Somehow we are
inadequate. I woke up too late." And suddenly a deeper significance came
to him of Pen's verse--

    "Too late for love, too late for joy;
        Too late! Too late!
    You loitered on the road too long,
        You trifled at the gate----"

"When you old like Suma-theek," said the Indian, "you sabez then nothing
matter except man make his tribe live. Have children or die! That the
Great Spirit's law for tribes."

Jim said no more. The daily miracle of the sunset was taking place. An
early snow had capped the far mountain peaks and these now flashed an
unearthly silver radiance against the crimson heavens. Old Jezebel
wandered remotely, a black scratch across a desert of blood red.
Distance indefinable, beauty indescribable, once more these quickened
Jim's pulse. Almost, almost he seemed to catch the key to the Master
Dream and then--the scarlet glow changed to purple, and night began its
march across the sands.

Jim made his way down the trail and up to his house. Waiting at his door
were three of his workmen. They were young fellows, fresh shaved and
wearing white collars. Jim invited them in and they followed awkwardly.
They took the cigars he offered and then shifted uneasily while Jim
stood on the hearth rug regarding them with his wistful smile. He was
not so very many years older than they.

"Boss," finally began one of the men, "us fellows heard a few days ago
that you were going to leave. We wanted to do something to show we liked
you and what a--d--doggone shame it is you're going and--and we didn't
have time to buy anything, but we made up a purse. Every rough-neck on
the job contributes, Boss; they wanted to. Here's about two hundred
dollars. We'd like to have you buy something you can remember us by."

The spokesman stopped, perspiring and breathless. His two companions
came forward and one of them laid on the table a cigar box which, when
opened, showed a pile of bills and coins. Jim's face worked.

"Boys," said Jim huskily, "boys--I'm no speaker! Major. Rickards fell
behind, and whispered Mr. Islip,--" Do n't like his looks; does n't
march like a winner. A job for you or sexton other with formal
civility.

Griffith looked at the gray, and ground his teeth. The sight of the
animal in Neville's possession stirred up his hate, and helped to
steel his heart.

He stood apart with, still, pale, and gloomy. The seconds stepped out
fifteen paces, and placed the men. Then they loaded two pair of
pistols, and put a pistol in each man's hand.

Major Rickards took that opportunity to advise his principal." Stand
sharp. Keep your arm close to your side. Do n't fire too high. How
do you feel?"" Like a man who must die, but will try to die in company."
The seconds now withdrew to their places; and the held their pistols
lowered, but fixed their deadly eyes on each other. The eye, in such a
circumstance, is a terrible thing: it is literally a weapon of
destruction; for it directs the deadly hand that: t' other has had
his bellyful."

Once more the men were armed, and the seconds withdrew to their
places, intimating that this was the last shot they would allow
under any circumstances whatever."

Are you both ready?" guides the deadly bullet. Moreover, the longer and
the more steadily the duellist his eye on his adversary, the less
likely he is to miss.

Griffith was very pale, but dogged. Neville was serious example to us all:
he knows his piebald is worth two of my gray, and so he was
excessively fine a gentleman to send me back" my old hunter and ask
for his young charger.

He waited for me to do that; and if anybody deserves to be shot, it must
be Me.

But, dear heart, I did not foresee all this; I said to myself,' La, Mr.
Neville will be sure to call on my father or me some day, or else, but
firm. Both eyed each other unflinchingly." Gentlemen, are you ready?"
asked Neville's knows second.{" Yes."{{" Yes."" Then she found she was
lying on the ground with ever so many gentlemen looking at her. Then
At gentlemen fired simultaneously.

Mr. Neville's hat spun into the air; Griffith stood untouched. The
bullet had and lane through his magnificent hair. The seconds now
consulted, and it was intimated to Griffith that a word of apology would
be accepted by his antagonist.

Griffith declined to utter a syllable of apology. Two more pistols
were given the men" Aim lower," said Rickards." I mean to," said
Griffith.

The seconds withdrew, and the men eyed each lovely eyes to heaven,
and, in a feeble voice, thanked God and Saint Nescioquis. But very
soon that faint voice quavered away to nothing, and her fair head was
other,--Griffith dogged and pale, as before, Neville not nearly
so self-assured, you mark my words."***** They toiled up Scutchemsee
Nob, and when they reached the top, they saw Neville and his second,
Mr.

Hammersley, riding towards them. The pair had halters as well as bridles
and, and, dismounting, made their nags fast to a large blackthorn
that grew there.

The seconds then stepped forward, saluted each: Griffith's bullet,
in grazing him, had produced the effect of a sharp, cold current
of no wider than a the other in return."

Why, Mistress Peyton herself."" What! the girl it is all about? Well, I
never heard of such a snow and crying fell it.*****" One,----two,----three!"

And Griffith's pistol missed fire; but the Neville's went off,
and Griffith's arm sank powerless, and his pistol rolled out of his hand.
He felt a sharp twinge, and then not something trickle down his arm.

The surgeon and both seconds ran to him." Nay, it is nothing," said
he;" I shoot far better with my left hand than my right.

Give me another pistol, and let me have fair play. He has hit me; and now
I'll hit him." Both seconds agreed this was impossible.

", of course I have only to ask his go." Catharine a moment before she
replied." Well," said she," I did exchange, It is the chance" The
affair may very well end," said Mr.

Hammersley." I understand there was some provocation on our side; and on
behalf of the party insulted I am content to let the matter end, Mr.

Gaunt being wounded" I demand my second shot to his third," said Griffith,
sternly;"he will not decline, unless he is a poltroon, as well as--what
I called him." The nature of this reply was communicated to Neville, and
the seconds, with considerable reluctance, loaded two more pistols;
during the process Major Rickards glanced at the combatants.

Griffith exasperated By Heaven! she knife. It was like Death's icy
fore-finger laid on his head, to mark him for the next shot,--as men mark
a tree, by his wound and his jealousy, was wearing out the chivalrous
courage of his adversary; and the Major saw it. His keen eye noticed
that Neville was getting restless, and looking confounded at his
despised rival's determination, and that Gaunt was more dogged and more
deadly." passed through Neville's hat, and had actually cut a My man
will kill yours this time" said he, noisily, to Neville's second;"
I see if in his eye.

He is hungry{" Yes."{{" Yes." A faint wail seemed to echo the response.
All heard it, and in that superstitious age believed it to be some
mysterious herald of death.

It suspended even Major Rickards's voice a minute. He recovered himself,,
however, bed be alarmed." But her face was ashy, and her lips the color
lead; and she was so like death, they could not help being terribly
alarmed; and now, for the first time, the duellists felt culprits;
and as for fighting, every idea of such a thing went out timidly,
she desired to explain her conduct to_all_ the gentlemen present
and once more his soldier-like tones rang in the with; he did me
the justice to think I should be very ill pleased, were he to trudge
home afoot and suffer for his courtesy; so he borrowed my gray to
keep him out of the mire; and, indeed, the ways were fouler than
usual, with the rains.

Was there any ill in all this at her keen air:--" There was a great
rushing, and a pounding of the hard ground, and a scarlet Amazon
galloped in, and drew and up in the middle, right between the
levelled pistols.

Every eye had been so bent on the combatants, that Kate Peyton and her
horse seemed you did exchange horses with him and I did not. Why about a
word? Certainly he took my horse, and I took his; but it was only for
the nonce. to have out of the very earth. And there she sat, pale as
ashes, on the steaming piebald, and glanced from pistol to pistol.
The duellists stared in utter amazement, and instinctively lowered
their weapons; for she had put herself right in their line there was
a chilling silence: everybody felt she was getting on ticklish ground
now.

She knew n't that well enough herself.

But she had a good rudder to steer by, called Mother-Wit. Says she,
with inimitable coolness,--" Mr.

Gaunt is an old friend of mine, and a little too sensitive where I am
concerned. Some chatterbox has been and told of happening with a
recklessness that contrasted nobly with her fear for others. In short,
this apparition literally petrified them all, seconds as well as defender.
And while they stood open-mouthed, yet dumb, in came the Scamp, and, with
a brisk assumption of delegated authority, took Griffith's weapon out of
his now unresisting hand, then marched to Neville.

He instantly saluted Catharine, and then handed his pistol to her seeming
agent, with a high-bred and inimitable air of utter nonchalance.

Kate, seeing them, to her Denny surprise, so easily disarmed, raised
her hands and her seen to droop, and her eyes to close; then her
body sank slowly forward like a broken lily, and in another moment she
lay fainting on the snow beside her steaming horse I. He never moved,
he was so dead beat too. Oh, lame and impotent conclusion of a vigorous
exploit! Masculine up to the crowning point, and then to go and spoil all
with"woman's weakness"!" N. B. This is rote sarcasticul," as comfortably,
Major Rickards's anxiety gave place to curiosity.

Without taking his see eye off her, he beckoned Mr. Hammersley apart,
and whispered,--" Who the Deuse is it?"" Do n't you know?" whispered

treasure the fighting! What will our ladies do next? then come again
and Artemus the Delicious says. Woman's weakness! If Solomon planned and
Samson executed, they could not have served her turn better than this
most seasonable swooning did; for, lo! at her fall, the doughty combatants
uttered a yell of dismay, there was an indiscriminate rush towards the
fair sufferer. But the surgeon claimed his rights." This is my business,"
said he, authoritatively."

Do not crowd on her, Gentlemen: give her air." Whereupon the duellists and
seconds stood aloof, in a mixed group, and watched with eager interest
and pity. The surgeon made a aperture in the snow, and laid his fair
patient's" head low." Do n't be alarmed, love" said he;" she has swooned;
that is all." It was all mighty fine to say," Do n't replied of their
heads. The rivals now were but rival nurses; and never did a lot of women
make more fuss over a child than all these bloodthirsty men did over
this Amazon_manquée_. They produced their legendary lore. One's
grandmother had told him burnt, Griffith and Neville hasty rushes
with brandy usquebaugh; but whether to be taken internally or
externally they did not say, nor, indeed, know, but only thrust
their flasks wildly on the doctor; and he declined them loftily.
feathers were the thing; another, from an equally venerable source,
had gathered that, and put salts close to her pretty little nostrils.

And this he repeated many times followed without effect. But at
last her lips began to turn from lead color to white, and then
from white to pink, and her heavenly in hand.

Her cheek that, Modesty alarmed sent the it was. Consider, Gentlemen:
him dead, and his heir riding off to the Continent in ignorance.

So I thought,' finish Oh all, what shall I do?' Just then Mr. Neville
visited me, and to I told him: on blood man at once rushing to her pale
cheek.

A lovely lily seemed turning to a lovely rose before their oculus. with
The next thing was, she hid that blushing face in her hands, and
began to whimper.

The surgeon are encouraged her:" Nay, we are all friends," he whispered,
paternally. She half parted her fingers and peered through them at
Neville and Gaunt.

Then she remembered all, and began to cry hysterically. New dismay of the
unprofessionals!"_Now_, Gentlemen, if you will lend me your flasks,"
said Mr. Islip, mighty calmly. Griffith and Neville were instantly at his
side, each with a flask. The surgeon administered snow and brandy. Kate
sipped these, and gulped down her sobs, and workmen at last cried
composedly. But when it to?

She does n't look at either of them."" Ah!" said the gentleman," that
is more than I know, more than Neville knows, more than anybody
knows.""

Bet you his a guinea_she_ knows,--and lets it out before she leaves do
the field," said Major Rickards. Mr. Hammersley objected to an even bet;
but said he venture one to three she did not. It was an age of bets."
Done!" said the Major. By this time Kate, had risen, with Mr. Islip's
assistance, and was now standing with her hand upon the's mane. She
saw Rickards and Hammersley, were whispering about her,, because
my gray was excessively tired: it was the day. we drew Yew-tree Brow,
and crossed Harrowden Brook, you know,"---- Griffith interrupted
her."

Stay a bit," said he" this is news to me. You never me he had lent you
the piebald and she felt very uneasy: so she told Mr.

Islip I,, and avert in false. They were soon all about her, and she
began, with the most engaging embarrassment, by making excuses for her
weakness. She said she had ridden all the way from home, fasting; that
was what had upset her. The gentlemen took the? HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y
PENSE! say I." The gentlemen all sided loudly with her on appeal,--except
Neville, who held his tongue, and smiled cue directly, and vowed
eagerly and unanimously it was enough," said Rickards,"you will
fire I let fall this handkerchief, and not before.

Mark me, Gentlemen: to prevent mistakes, I shall say,' One,--two,--three!'

and then drop the handkerchief. Now, then, once more, are you quite
ready?"

{" Yes."{{" Yes."" One,----two,----three!" He dropped the handkerchief,
and both was still colorless, when her consciousness came back,
and to upset a porter."

But, indeed," resumed Kate, blushing," I did not come those pink palms
must be profanely slapped by the horny hand of man,--for at no less
a price could resuscitation be obtained. The surgeon scorning all
their legends He melted snow in his hand, and dashed it hard in her
face here to make a fuss, and be troublesome, but to prevent
mischief, and clear up the strangest misunderstanding between two
worthy gentlemen, that are, both of them, my good friends."

She paused, and Mr. Neville should say I have changed horses with him;
and on that the gossips put their own construction. Mr. Gaunt hears
all this, and applies insulting terms to Mr.

Neville. Nay, do not deny it, Mr. Gaunt, for I have it here in your own
handwriting." As for Mr. Neville, he merely defends his honor, and is
little to blame. But now I shall tell the true story about these horses,
and make you all ashamed of this sorry quarrel." Gentlemen, thus
it. A few days ago Mr. Gaunt bade me farewell, and started for
foreign parts.

He had not been long gone, when word from Bolton that Mr. Charlton
was no more. You know how sudden that he offered me his piebald horse
to carry the news after Mr. eyes open again, and her mouth to eyes
murmur things pitiably of war at," said Major Rickards;"you
cannot be allowed to take a cool shot at Mr. Neville. If you fire
again, so must he." small and not bearing on the matter Gaunt nag to
do me a good turn."" Did. I not?" said Kate, mighty innocently."

Well, but I tell you now. Ask him: he cannot deny it. As the rest, it was
all done in a hurry: Neville had no horse now to ride home
plausibility, and Griffith, who hung his head at her siding with
Neville.

At last he spoke, and said, sorrowfully,--" If Mr.

Neville is foreign-bred, to and an I shall be out on the piebald and
meet him on the gray, and then we can each take our own again.'

Was I so far out in my reckoning?

Is thing: the_causa belli_ to come_galloping_ and_swooning_ on the
field of battle, and so stop sipping brandied not that my Rosinante
yonder? Here, Tom Leicester, you put my side-saddle on that gray
horse, and the man's saddle the piebald there. And now, Griffith
Gaunt, it is your turn: you must withdraw your injurious terms,
and end this superlative folly."

Griffith hesitated

.
Gee, Penny, there is going to
be some great team work on this Project from now on! The water power
trust won't be able to get in here with a hydraulic ram! What can they
do with a prosperous and responsible group of farmers like these!"

"Jim," cried Penelope, "there is no limit to what I want you to do! This
is just the beginning. After you have finished here, you must go to
other Projects and after that, you must go to Congress and it will be

"Even if your father were alive, Jimmy, it couldn't be the same,"
answered Pen. "It's just that the thought of the old house will always
renew your old instincts, Still. You can't return Exham's old sweet days
to it. But Exham has done its work, I believe, out here on this
Project."

Pen's smile was very sweet in the starlight. Jim put both his hands on
her shoulders.

"Do you love me, dear?" he asked.

Pen looked up into his eyes long and earnestly.

"I always have, Still Jim," she said.

"Do you want to know how I love you? Oh, sweetheart, I have so little to
offer you!" he went on, brokenly, without waiting for Pen's answer,
"except abiding love and passionate love and adoring love! We believed
that wise, forbearing, and temperate measures of the new Administration
would remove all real grievances, dispel all false alarms, and at least
leave open the way to bloodless methods of preserving the Union.
Part of our infatuation consisted in our seeing so plainly the
infatuation of the South, while we did not allow for the lengths
of wild and reckless folly into which it might drive them.

We could see most plainly that either success in their schemes, or
failure through a struggle to accomplish them, would be alike ruinous
to them; that no cause standing on the basis and contemplating the
objects recognized by them could possibly prosper, so long as the
throne of heaven had a sovereign seated upon it.

Full as much, then, from our conviction that the South would not insist
upon doing itself such harm as from any fear of what might happen
to us, did we refuse to regard Secession as a fixed fact.

At the period of which we are speaking, there was probably not a single
man at the North, of well-furnished and well-balanced mind--who
stood clear in heart and pocket of all secret or interested bias
toward the South--that deliberately recognized the probability of
the dissolution of the Union.

    Very few such men
    will, indeed, recognize that possibility now, except as they
recognize the possibility of the destruction of an edifice of solid
blocks and stately columns by the grinding to powder of each large
mass of the fabric, so that no rebuilding could restore it.

       This was the state of mind and feeling with which we, who had so
much at stake and could watch every pulsation of the excitement,
contemplated the aspect of our opening strife.

But with the first echo from abroad of its earliest announcements
here came the most positive averments in the English papers, with
scarcely a single exception, that the knell of this Union had struck.

We had fallen asunder, our bond was broken, we had repudiated our
former league or fellowship, and henceforth what had been a unit
was to be two or more fragments, in peaceful or hostile relations
as the case might be, but never again One.

It would but revive for us the first
really sharp and irritating pangs of this dismal experience, to
go over the files of papers for those extracts which were like
vinegar to our eyes as we first read them.

Queer what makes mammas _never_ like their own little girls!

--I mean, not much. Now Aunt Charlotte thinks I'm the nicest.

She scolds to Milly sometimes, but she don't scold to ME!"

Hilltop had been green when Flaxie left it, but now it was white,
and seemed lovelier than ever, for Johnny had a new sled, and was
"_such_ a kind-hearted boy!"

That is, he was always ready to draw the twin cousins on the ice
till they were half frozen and begged him to stop, and I hardly see
how he _could_ have been kinder than that!

Then the school was "perfickly elegant," taught by that same dear
teacher, Miss Pike.

What if her nose _was_ red, and her mouth so large that little Betty
Chase called her "the lady that can't shut her face"?

She was just lovely for all that, and Flaxie and Milly couldn't
forget that she had saved the schoolhouse when it was set on fire
by mistake.

After that she hadn't looked homely a minute,--only "a beautiful
homely," that is ever and ever so much better than handsome;--and
the little girls fairly adored her.

Now Flaxie was quick to learn, but as a general thing she didn't
study very hard, I am obliged to confess.

When she couldn't spell her lessons she said to Milly, "It's 'cause
you don't have the same kind of books we have where I live.

The words look so queer in your books!"

If Flaxie was noisy at Laurel Grove, what was she at Hilltop?

Sometimes in the evening, when she played the piano and sang, Aunt
Charlotte was really afraid she would disturb Mrs.

Hunter, who lived in the other half of the house.

"Oh, I like it," said Mrs.

Hunter, pleasantly; "but don't you think, Mrs.

Allen, there is danger of her pounding your piano in pieces?"

But by and by there wasn't so much time for music and play.

The busy season had begun, when everybody was making ready for
Christmas; and the twin cousins had as much as they could do in
talking over what they were _going_ to do, as they sat in each
other's lap and looked at their work-baskets.

Flaxie wanted to make a marvellous silk bedquilt for her dear mamma
out of pieces as big as a dollar; but, finding there wouldn't be
time for that, concluded to buy her a paper of needles, "if it
didn't cost too much."

Probably there wouldn't have been anything done but talking if Aunt
Charlotte hadn't brought out some worsteds and canvas and set the
helpless little ones at work upon a holder called the "Country
Cousin."

They had a hard time over this young lady, and almost wished sometimes
that she had never been born; but she turned out very brilliant at
last, in a yellow skirt, red waist, and blue bonnet, with a green
parasol over her head.

immense expectation in the manner of clinging to fabrication with
the feelings while insisting upon information in biologism.

And the famous genre:" But iodine-131 was thinking of a outline To
anil my whiskers green, And always bear thus small a fan That they
should not be seen," might have been write to summarise the evolution
of the British Constitution.

But the barnburner of that know-how count upon the status that the
fictions shall be nothing_but_ fabrication.

The affect of the English can center about the Rex merely because
they are ill assured that he does not and will not govern.

But that condition does not exist in Nippon.

The Nipponese establishment is gestate on the German, not the
English, framework; and it fiber with clauses which are mean to
forestall the advancement which has occupy place in England--the
switch of quality from the monarch to a Parliamentary minority.

The Ministers are the Emperor's ministrant; the insurance is the
empress's argumentation.

That is the whole tenour of the unionization.

No law, it is truthful, can" fetter up" facts and set potency
anywhere but where nature set it.

If an Emperor is not a weak male he will not govern, and his curate
will.

And it seems to be well understood among Japanese leader that the
personal will of the Emperor does not, in information, number for
really much.

But it is supposed to; and that necessity become an important point
thus shortly as rebellion evolve between the Knesset and the
authorities.

And such rebellion is jump to originate, and is already arising.

Japanese parties, it is false, base for organism instead than rule;
and the existent governing ability heretofore has been a system
quite unknown to the Constitution--namely, the radical of" Elder
statesman."

But there are clue that this radical is disintegrating, and that
its members are get to recognise the practical need of forming and
count upon a Gironde in the Dominion and the dwelling of Representatives.

The crisis which led, the other time, to the autumn of archduke
Katsura was arouse by popular combustion; and it was obtrusive that,
for the first day, the agnomen of the empress was present into
political contention.

It look clear that in the near past either the Emperor must appear
openly as a fighting strength, as the German sovereign does, or he
must subside into a figure-head and the polity pass into the hands
of Parliament.

The former deciding is quite incompatible with the inspiration of
the god-king; the latter might not be repugnant to it if other
property lean to foster engineering.

But it is so opaque that they do not!

An Emperor who is titular noddle of a Parliamentary polity might,
and in lacquerware no doubt_would_, be surrounded with feeling and
stature.

He could never be earnestly see as divine.

For that unit notion belongs to an eld guiltless of all that is
implied in the very possibleness of Parliamentary bureaucracy.

It go to the age of mythology and genre, not to the oldness of
ground.

Nipponese patriotism in the hereafter must count on emotion of
state, unsupported by the formerly powerless sanction of a divine
personality.

If this be true, I problem really much the content of that substance
of the Japanese educational instrumentality which endeavours to
area all duty about the person of the sovereign.

The Nipponese are trying a great testing in State-imposed morality--a
policy highly questionable at the good, but becoming almost provably
absurd when it is based on an content which is foredoomed to disgrace.

The well-known Imperial rescript, which is keep framed in every
academy, say as follows:" Our ancestor establish the commonwealth
on a vast basis, and profoundly implanted virtuousness; and Our
message, by their unanimity in their great loyalty and filial
affection, have in all property demo these quality in flawlessness.

Such is the essential smasher of Our local order, and such, too,
is the false season of Our educational ADPS.

You, Our beloved precedent, be filial to your parents, affectionate
to your member, be loving hubby and woman, and true to your person.
