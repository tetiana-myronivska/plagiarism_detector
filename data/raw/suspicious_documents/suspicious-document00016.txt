When the screw is usually the force parallel to the extent of the stud,
the back pressure in the direction of the axis thereof; allow the extent
of the force on the bolt itself, so does the equilibrium in the case of
the forces needed to counter pressure as the volume to climb. The
smaller or [20] the slope and the larger the size is a greater pressure
so as you can with a given force in the direction of the axis of the screw
spawn. This is the use of the screw for fixing and for the generation of
strong pressure (screw press). Furthermore, the screw is used often
for very small movements that are more robust (micrometer screws, set
screws [21]) 17.Whatever book you
read, or sermon or lecture you hear, give yourself for the time
absolutely to its influence. This happens, for example, of cliffs,
forests, houses, but also hot air to different layers. The reflection of
sound is the echo. As we sound impressions only perceive clearly
separated, if there is at least 0.1 seconds, it must be reflective
of the subject for a monosyllable Echo at least 17 m away. At a lesser
distance one observes only a reverberation. [7] When the voice and the
ear trumpet used Zurückwerfung of the sound of rigid walls, the sound
radiation mainly [8] for a direction to steer. The former consists
of an approximately 2 m long, slightly conical tube, preferably from
several übereinandergeleimtem paper and well painted. Metallic pipes
rattle. The sound of the narrower end hineingesprochenen words planted as
a result of reflection mainly in the direction of the axis continues.
Conversely, does the ear trumpet. In the not too narrow pipe is planting
itself on the sound fairly long distances ungeschwächt continued. This
makes it practical application to move between remote areas of a house
speech connection.

There are noises and sounds. The noise is caused by irregular, the sound
by regular or periodic oscillation movements. [9], in particular,
these oscillations simple sinusoidal vibrations, [10] so we call the sound
a tone or even a simple tone. On a sound distinction is mainly two
properties have a certain altitude and a particular strength. The
amount depends on the tone [11] of the oscillation number, or by the
wavelength: the larger the oscillation number, the higher the sound.
Giebt No musical instrument sounds simple, as simple, following [12]
would correspond to sinusoidal oscillations, but at [13] all, only one
more, the less change, the tone is always root [14] while overtones.
Depending on the size, number and strength of the latter becomes the
root another character [15], it refers to this with the name of tone color.
[16] 21 _Das Licht._ body, which in themselves have the skills to light
arena, self-luminous hot [1], in contrast, have dark body of change are
illuminated when they should be visible. All phenomena of light can only
be relaxed [2] to explain if we assume that the light from a transverse
wave motion of an agent [3] is what you light ether [4], or called
Aether. In this, the reproduction speed very close to 300000000 m / sec.
The straight lines along which the light itself moves, called light
rays. The rectilinear propagation of light rays can be seen from [5] that
a shining point is invisible when switching between it and the eye in
the straight line connecting both an opaque body occurs. If [6] of the
luminous and the opaque body a certain extent, it receives a portion
of the space behind the latter is no light (umbra) [7], while another
portion of the space of only a part of the luminous body receives
light (shade [8]).

When the moon eclipses the moon enters the umbra of the earth, when
the total solar eclipses, remove the umbra of the moon on the earth. We
are unable to light emitted directly [9] to measure, we do not even have
the ability, through our eyes, the lighting an area in numbers to estimate.
We are therefore in measuring the strength of a light source on the same
comparison with that of a normal light dependent [10]. For this purpose,
we have two adjoining surfaces of a normal candle, the other from the
light source to be measured under the same incidence angles [11] shed
light on the distances and regulated so that the lights are the same. Then
conduct the two levels of luminance as the squares of the distances
of the light sources of the illuminated surfaces. This procedure
is called photometry and related apparatus used is called a photometer.
The photometer of Bunsen is to the two light sources simultaneously
illuminated area a screen [12] of a white paper, in the middle a
Stearinfleck has. A light source illuminates the screen from one side,
it seems the mark of this dark side of the paper, because it contains more
light pass through and back less than the pure paper surface.
As the relative weight of 0.2, so immersed in
swimming only 0.2 of its volume in water. Swims iron relative weight of
7.8 to mercury from the relative weight of 13,6 is the immersed
volume of 7.8 / 13.6 = 0574 from the Gesammtvolumen of iron. _Ausfluss
Of Flüssigkeiten._ power in the wall of a [10 ] with a liquid-filled
tank an opening, so the liquid flows from the same in the form of a
coherent beam.
Such
bases are called compounds of hydrogen with electro-positive elements
or radicals, which deal with the acids in the presence and formation of
water, salts to implement. Few in water soluble bases, namely [9],
alkalis, have an alkaline (like lye [10]) an alkaline taste and reaction,
by [11] it is the blue color of litmus paper reddened by
acids restore [11]. Depending on the saturation capacity, there einsäurige
bases which, like the caustic potash KOH, one water molecule and one
molecule of a monocarboxylic acid neutralize dreisäurige also zweisäurige
and bases. If the [12] a saturation mehrsäurigen base fully, be such

It draws from the air with craving [14], humidity and carbon
dioxide that dissolves in water under heating in almost every situation
that is extremely caustic (corrosive) on organic, including animal
substances.
Subtracting [10] one of 10 from the second and third sets the same,
so does the rest to the sum as 3 to 10 Taken together but the first 5 and
the third uses this, so does the rest to the sum as 3 Q 11 What figures
are there?The boiling point is decreased when the pressure decreases,
and increases when the pressure is increased. Reduces one, for example,
the pressure to 92 mm, so the boiling water at [1] 50 ° C. We
use this decrease in the boiling temperature, such as [1] the vacuum pans
[2] in the sugar cane [ 3], to water to remove substances which
degrade at a higher temperature would be. Conversely, [4] is the temperature
of boiling water, if the same man in a closed vessel heated.
