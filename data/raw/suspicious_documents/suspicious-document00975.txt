danced, the old charity called to bystanders, and rained on it
stones Ochavo and quarters to boardwalk, which also has the force
of beauty awakening charity asleep.

After the dance, said Preciosa: - If you give me four quarters, I
myself will sing a romantic, very beautiful, when it comes to our
lady the Queen Margarita left to church and went to Valladolid in
San Llorente: dígoles who is famous, and comprising a number of the
poet, as captain of the battalion.

Hardly had said this, when nearly all who were at the wheel told

Indeed, since its August, and harvest their rattles Repic Preciosa,

More than two hundred people were watching the dancing and listening
to the song of the gypsies, and the leakage was right to go there

he asked what it was, and fuel that were answered by listening to
Gitanilla beautiful singing.

Llegóse the Tiniente, which was curious, and listened a while, and not
to go against gravity, the romance did not hear until the end, and
being extremely similar across the Gitanilla well, his command to a
page saying that the old gitana the evening was to his house with
the gypsy, who wanted to hear donates his wife Clara.

Paje thus made, and the old Iria said yes. They finished the dance and
song and left the street below, and from a grid Some knights called
gypsies. Preciosa Asomóse the grate, which was low, and saw a room
very well dressed and very fresh that many knights, strolling around
and playing games are entertained. - Quiérenme provide cheap, ceñores
- said Preciosa which, as gypsy ceceoso spoke, and this is artificial
in them, not nature.

A Beautiful voice and his face, which stopped playing the game, and

had della news, saying: - Come, enter the gitanilla; that give

- If you want to go in, Preciosa - said one of the three that iban

there are so many men. - Mira, Cristina - Beautiful responded -
from what you've is saved as a single man alone, and not so many

offended.

Warns, Cristina, and is certain of one thing: the woman who is determined
to be honored among an army of soldiers can be. Truth is that good

- Cristina said - and that you know more than a wise man.

Animólas the old gypsy, and entered and there was hardly entered
Preciosa, when she saw the knight of the habit _un_ role came

brings this letter with bearing: take this shield that comes to
romance. -- -Just - Preciosa said ---, which has treated me poorly

Well that is more true miracle to me, give me a poet, a coat that I

_Romancero general_ and send one to one, that I tentaré pulse, and
come hard , am I soft in recebillos. admired were those who heard the
Gypsy, and his discretion and the grace with which he spoke. The

the old thirty reais and richer and more joyful one Easter Flowers,

on the other day to return to their flock to give content to those
very liberal gentlemen.

Ya notice was Mrs Ms Clara, wife of Lord Lieutenant, and had to go home
the gitanilla and estábalas waiting as the water in May she and
her maidens and masters, with the other neighbor lady yours, that
all came together to Beautiful to watch and had just entered the Roma,
where among other precious as the resplendent light of a torch lights
among other minors, and thus, all ran to her, some hugged, others
watched, they the blessed, those the worshiped. Ms Clare said: - That
it can be said that hair of gold!

Those that do are emerald eyes! Mrs shredded all the neighboring and
pepitoria made of all its members and joints. And coming to praise
a small hole that was beautiful in the beard, said: - Oh, what hole?
In this hole must face those eyes watching him. He heard a squire of
this arm of the lady doña Clara, there were, Luengas and long beard, and
said: - My goodness, so cute Gitanilla is that made of silver or
icing could not be better!

You know the good fortune to say, girl? - Three or four ways -
Precious responded. - And more so - said Dona Clara ---. For Tiniente
life, my lord, that I've said, girls in gold, silver and girl, girl and
pearls, and girls of anthrax, and child of heaven, what more can I
say. - Give , give the palm to the girl and make the cross - said the
old - and see what things they say and they know more than one
doctor melecina. faldriquera Echo hand to Mrs.

Lieutenant , and found that he was not white. Asked their maids quarter,
and none took him, nor the lady neighbor either. Thus seen by Preciosa
said - all the crosses, as crosses, are good, but of silver or gold
are better, and draw a cross in the palm of the hand with copper
coin that grants undermines know vues the good fortune, at least, mine
and so, I do love the first cross with a coat of gold or any real to
eight, or at least of four, I'm like sacristans: that when there
is a good gift, rejoice. - Donaire you, girl, for life - said Mrs
neighbor.

And turning to the squire, he said: - You, Mr. Contreras, you will have
a real hand of four ? Dádmele; the doctor coming in to my husband he
will come back. - I do have - Contreras responded - but téngole
committed maravedís twenty-two, who I had dinner last night; dénmelos,
that I will go for him in flying. -- We do not have all quarter -
said Dona Clara ---, and twenty-two maravedís ask?

Walk, Contreras, who always went impertinente. A girl of this, seeing
the sterility of the house, told Gorgeous - Girl, will something be
done if the cross with a silver thimble - Prior - Preciosa said - are
the best in the world with crosses of silver thimbles, as are many.
- I've got one - said the girl --- and if it is sufficient here
hele, with condition that I must tell me the good fortune. - Why
so many buenasventuras thimble - said the old gypsy ---.

Nieta just presto, it becomes night. Preciosa took the thimble, and the
lady's hand and said Lt. _ # the good fortune, and finishing # _ ignited
the desire of all bystanders in wanting to know yours, and you
all prayed, but she referred them to come on Friday, promising that
they would have to make real silver crosses. In this, Mr Tiniente came,
who told of the wonders Gitanilla he made them dance a little, and
confirmed by real and well given the praise that had been beautiful,
and putting his hand into the faldriquera, did want to signal give
something, and having espulgado and shaken, scraped, and often
brought out to the empty hand and said: - Jesus Christ that I am
not white!

Give him your Doña Clara, a real price, that I will give you later.
[Illustration: ... and put his hand into the faldriquera, ...] - Well

any of us to make the fourth sign of the cross, and you want to
have a real - then Give him some valoncica yours, or some little
thing, that we will return another day to see beautiful, and gave

To which Ms Clare said: - Well, it comes again, I do not want to give
anything now Preciosa. - Before if I do not give anything - ---
Precious said, never come back here. But it will come back to serve lords
as a major, but swallowed trairé not have to give me anything, and
ahorraréme fatigue esperallo. Bribery vues mercy, sir Tiniente, bribery,
and take money and not make new uses, that will die of hunger. Look,
Madam, I have heard out there (and even girl, I understand that these
are not good) which has the offices of money to pay the condemnations
of the residences and to claim fees. - So you say and what do desalmados

need not pay any condemnation, and have used her office will Valedor
to get another. - Talk to the market very vues saint, sir Lieutenant

    Shut up, I will give that trace

Querránme rascals - replied Preciosa --- and I do not know what to
be and everything will be lost.

If I wanted to discreetly take Hian yet, but some thrive palacimás
thugs that discreet. I found to be good and poor gypsy, and run the
lot where the sky wants. - Hey, girl - said the old gypsy - not more
talk, you've talked a lot and know more than I I have taught you,
you do not asotiles So you stand out, talk about what you let years

devil is in the body these gypsy!

-- said this time the Tiniente. Despidiéronse gypsies, and go, "said
the maid's thimble - Preciosa, tell me the good fortune, or vuélveme

Preciosa, do note that I said it, and provide another thimble, or
do not do vanilla until Friday, I will come back and tell more
ventures and adventures that you have a book of chivalry.
Fuéronse and juntáronse with the many farmers that when the Hail Mary
usually leave Madrid to go back to their villages, and many others
back, who always accompanied the gypsies, and returned safely.

Because the old gypsy living in constant fear not jump to its Preciosa.
Occurred, therefore, that the morning of one day returning to Madrid
to take gitanilla garrama with others in a small valley that is the
work of five steps before reach the village, they saw a man dressed
richly and gallant way.

The sword and dagger were brought, as is often said, an ember of gold,
with rich cintillo and hat with feathers of various colors decorated.
Gypsy repaired in seeing and looking very pusiéronsele space, admired
for such a beautiful man hours were in that place, on foot and
alone.

He came to them and talking to the gypsy couple, he said: - For your life,
friend, do me pleasure you and me oyáis here Preciosa two separate words
that are your benefit. - As we deviate much, or we were too late,
is in good time - answered the old.

                     And calling Preciosa, were diverted to other work of twenty steps,
and stood, as they were, the man told them: - I so I yielded to the
discretion and beauty of Preciosa, that after having done a lot of
strength to apologize to this point, after I have been given more
and more unable to excusallo.

Yo, ladies mine (where I have to give this name, if my claim favors the
sky), I am a knight, as you can show this habit - and the herreruelo
away, discovered in the chest one of the most qualified in that
Spain ---, I'm the son of Fulano - which is not good here respects
states --- his name, I am under their care and protection, I'm an
only child, and waiting a reasonable mayorazgo.

My father is here in the Court claiming a charge, and is consulted,
and is almost certain hopes of leaving with him. And to be of quality
and nobility that I have referred, and which you should already
be almost be translucent, with all that, I would be a great lord to
raise my beautiful grandeur of humility, and I like making my
lady. I want to serve more as she gustare: your will is mine. For it
is my soul wax, where you can print what we would like, and to conserve
it and save it as it will not be printed on wax, but as carved in
marble, whose hardness is opposed to the length of time. If you
believe this truth, I do not accept any faint hope, but if you do
not believe me, I am always afraid you will doubt.

My name is this - and díjoselo ---; that of my father and I said
you the house you live in this street is, and has such and such signs,
it has to inform those who can, and even those who are also neighbors,
that is not as Escura quality and the name of my father and me, you
do not know in the courtyards of the palace, and even throughout the
Court. Hundred gold escudos brought here to give you and sign in
arra what I say because it does not deny the wealth that gives the
soul.

As this gentleman said he was watching. Preciosa carefully, and certainly
you do not mind wrong or had their reasons or their size, and turning
to the old, he said: - Excuse me, Grandma, that I take leave to respond
to this gentleman.
Mr. Aubrey removed to the cottage with his family, according to the
request of his nephews, which consisted of his wife and only son.
Fostina was now an inmate of her uncle's family, where she was treated
with the greatest kindness, and received from them every possible
attention which was in their power to bestow.

Her aunt was quiet and gentle in her manner towards her, ever ready to
administer the balm of consolation to the broken-hearted girl, who wept
in the bitterness of solitude. In her moments of grief and sadness, she
would retire alone to her apartment, there to meditate upon her lonely
situation. At these times Mrs. Aubrey never failed to exert her utmost
endeavors to cheer her with words of kindness, giving hope and
consolation that happy days were yet to come.

But, alas! the lonely maiden in the Mountain Glen had almost fallen a
victim to despair. Her merry voice, which had so often rung over the
Mountain like music in the air, was now no longer heard. The rose had
faded from her cheek, and her once bright eyes were dimmed with tears,
and her lovely countenance bore the traces of deep sorrow.

In vain did her uncle endeavor to soothe her grief, and calm her
troubled spirit, that

    Sought for rest, but found despair
      Companion of its way.

Often, at the close of day, Fostina would wander forth to visit the
graves of her departed friends, who now slept in sweet repose beneath
the shadow of the willow, which waved its drooping branches above them.
Here, side by side, they lay, in the same spot which had been selected
by Mr. Woodman in life, where they might live in peaceful seclusion.

Weeks rolled by, and the deep interest which Mr. and Mrs. Aubrey had
taken in their fair charge, and the great kindness which they
manifested towards her, had in some degree resigned her to her fate.
The ever-watchful care of Mrs. Aubrey, and the numerous favors bestowed
upon her by her friends, were now rewarded by the cheerfulness which
she assumed, when in the family circle.

It was late one lovely afternoon in the month of August, the sun had
sunk into the golden west, and all nature seemed to be hushed in silent
repose. The shades of twilight had gathered around, and the lovely
Fostina wandered forth to visit the graves of her departed friends.
After remaining there a short time, she turned her steps towards the
Mountain, and seated herself in a pleasant nook, overshadowed by a
lofty elm.

All was silent save the gentle murmur of the sparkling rivulet, which
flowed beneath her feet, and the graceful bending of the branches
around her, gently moved by the evening zephyrs. She was silent a
while, musing on the past and contemplating the scene before her,
recalling to her memory the many happy hours spent in this lovely spot
with the now absent and loved ones. She thought of the many happy
seasons passed in their society; and now what a striking contrast! The
bright hopes which had once caused her young heart to beat with joy and
gladness, seemed forever fled from her youthful breast! She leaned her
head against the branches of a willow, where she sat, and wept in grief
and sorrow. The shades of night had gathered round, and the lonely
maiden unconsciously fell into a quiet slumber. The moon had risen, and
now shone forth in all its beauty, casting its silver rays through the
branches of the willow which hung mournfully over the fair sleeper. As
the light shone upon her countenance, she seemed most lovely to behold.
A calm of quiet resignation had spread over her features, and she lay
like one

    Who slept--in sweet repose,
    With angels hovering round.

She slept, and dreamed the following dream:--

                     *      *      *      *      *

    FOSTINA'S DREAM.

    She thought it was a lovely spring morning, and her beloved Lewis,
    with her, accompanied by her brothers, had left their home, to be
    absent a few days on a visit to a friend who resided some miles
    from the village. After riding some distance from the Mountain,
    they heard the report of a musket, seemingly not far distant; the
    horses suddenly took fright, and rushed on through the forest at
    their utmost speed, throwing the travellers prostrate upon the
    earth. When Fostina had recovered from the shock she had received
    by her sudden fall from the carriage, what was her astonishment to
    find herself at her uncle's residence, attended by her uncle and
    aunt, with her cousin Rineldo watching over her! As soon as she
    was restored to consciousness enough to realize her situation, she
    earnestly inquired for Lewis and her brothers; and on being
    informed that they had not been seen, she immediately rushed from
    the house to the late scene of confusion. When she arrived at the
    spot, no one was to be seen; she called, but no answer came to the
    sound of her voice, save the echo of the distant hills. Almost
    frantic with grief, she hastened from the spot to the Mountain, but
    her friends could not be found; she continued her search, but in
    vain; she entered the cottage, but could gain no intelligence of
    the missing ones. The horrible reality now flashed upon her mind,
    that some enemy had pursued them, and her friends had been taken
    prisoners; the report which she recollected to have heard,
    confirmed her in this belief.

    With this awful impression resting upon her mind, the distracted
    girl threw herself down in despair; she thought of the mysterious
    circumstances which had taken place on that eventful day, but all
    was clouded with the deepest mystery. Night came on, and Fostina,
    little thinking of the dangers to which she was herself exposed,
    rose to renew her search for the lost ones, when she imagined that
    she saw a light glimmering at a distance through the trees; a
    second glance convinced her of its reality, and she turned her
    steps in the direction from which she saw it. On approaching the
    spot, she discovered that the light which she had seen issued from
    a rude dwelling. As she ventured nearer, she heard voices within,
    which induced her to enter. When she reached the entrance, she
    rapped gently at the door; an aged man made his appearance,
    manifesting great surprise on seeing the youthful stranger at his
    lonely residence, at that late hour of the night.

    He looked at the sorrowful maiden with tenderness and compassion,
    who seemed apparently in great distress. On seeing the kindness of
    the stranger, she briefly related to him the circumstances which
    had taken place on that day.

    He then informed her that a few hours before, a young man, severely
    wounded, had been conveyed there by some persons unknown. 
    Konrad Graf was delighted, and thought no more that he was dying
    sick, he invited on the following day all the guests again, previously
    his gloom as early auseinandergescheucht had held public engagement
    with his bride, and when applied Truchseß and now had herumzählte,
    he found that no cover was too much. Top joined the Knights from
    the Order left the Komterhof and performed the wedding with great
    pomp. In this strange house proved to change the busy Martha, Mrs.
    Gertrude, quite passive, as they guarded Miss Matilde chamber and
opening at the same stately dressed lady came to light, her
astonishment was so great that she fell backwards from his chair,
a leg ausrenkte frozen and remained paralyzed for life.

                     [Illustration] [Illustration] The newlyweds verlebten the first
year at Augsburg.

One day, when they are happy conversations sat at the open window,
the young countess said: "My dear heart Lord, I am now no desire
left, I adopted my Bisamapfel the wish fulfillment of the third
with joy. Do you have a hidden but some concern in your heart, it's
kund tut mir, I want it to the mine and the moment you should be
granted. "Graf Konrad concluded his trusted wife in his arms and
assured her, that besides the continuation of his fortune for him
nothing more desirable on earth was. So the Bisamapfel lost in the
eyes of his owner, value, and they all kept it only for the grateful
memory of the godfather Nixe. [Illustration] Konrad Graf had a
mother alive, on their Wittum to Schwabeck lived. In your child love to
kiss the hand, wore the pious daughter big request, but the count
always rejected the pilgrimage to the mother apparently visible under
a pretext and was on a pleasure trip to a home he recently sent in Feudal
proposal of unfern Wackermann destroyed castle located; Mathilde
agreed gladly burned to the area again to visit, where they receive
their first youth verlebt had.

They visited the ruins of his father's apartment, beweinte the ashes
of her parents, went to the fountain mermaids and hoped that their
presence would invite the nymph to take it up versichtbaren. Some
stones fell into the well without the hoped effect, even the sponge
as a Bisamapfel light water bubble on top, and they had to take the
trouble, herauszufischen himself again.

The nymph was no longer to be seen. Come home, got a son wife
Mathilde, beautiful like a god boy, and the joy of the parents was
so great that they made him almost squeezing hot love, the mother did
not let him in her arms and peered every breath of the little innocent
angel, though the Count a wise nurse was hired, that of the Kindl
One should cultivate.

But in the third night, because everything in the castle of a wobble
in joy celebration was buried deep sleep, the mother also turned a
gentle slumber, and when she awoke, was the child from her arms away!
Cried the frightened dismay Countess: "Amme, where were you my child
lying?" The nurse replied, "Noble woman, the delicate Herrlein is
in your arms." Bed and room were anxiously searched, but found
nothing except some Blutströpflein on the floor of the chamber. As
the nurse was inne, they raised great cries: "Oh, that God and
all the saints have mercy! The werewolf has been present and has
the child away. "The Countess grämte about the loss of the Holden
boys skinny and pale, and the father was untröstbar. Although the
werewolf belief in his heart, not a mustard seed aufwog, so he settled
yet from the chatter, since it is the case in no way to explain
knew übertäuben, desolate comforted his wife, from complacency to
him, who hated all the sadness, the forced to accept a cheerful
countenance.

[Illustration] The Schmerzenstilgerin, the most active time, finally
healed the mother's heart wound, as the loss of a second son, was
replaced.

Boundless was the joy of the beautiful master's heirs in the Count's
palace, the Count bankettierte cheerful courage with its neighbors
around a day's journey, the joy went without a cup from hand to
hand, of host and guests to Türhüter around, on the health of the
Neugebornen.

The anxious mother had the child not to be erwehrte of sweet sleep, while
it allowed its forces, but because they finally meet the demands of
nature had to give in, she took the golden chain from the neck,
umschlang so Knäbleins of the body and fastened the other the end of
it to her arms, and blessed is the child of the Holy Cross, that the
werewolf no power nor authority wants to find out, and soon they attacked
an irresistible sleep. When she first morning beam aroused, o woe!
there was the sweet boy from her arms disappeared. In the first
fright she exclaimed as formerly, "nurse, where did you my child
lying?" And the nurse replied again: "Noble woman, the delicate
Herrlein is in your arms."

Immediately after they saw the golden Kettlein that they order the
arm slung had found that a joint with a sharp steel scissors
entzweigeschnitten middle, and fell fainting in front of horrified
way. The nurse made noise in the home, the servants rushed full
consternation of guilt, and since Graf Konrad heard what had
happened, his heart was kindled by rage and zeal, he zückte his
knightly sword, meaning that the head nurse to divide. "Wicked woman,
"he thundered with a terrible voice," I gave you no secret command,
to stay awake all night and no sight of the boy to use, so that if
the monster would be him of the sleeping mother wegzurauben you
through your cries the House made brisk, so we distributed the
werewolf?

Sleep now, you Schläferin, the long sleep of death! "The woman
fell to the knees before him." Strict lord, "said she," for God's
mercy, I implore you, me erwürget moment so shameful I take to the
grave with, my eyes have seen, and neither me nor the behest
abdringen wage should wofern they do not torture herauspreßt.

"The Count was amazed," what shameful, "he asked," have you seen with the
eyes, so black is that your tongue refuses, out of it? Dear me confess
without torture, what you been known as a faithful servant. ""
Sir, "the prostitute erseufzte," what drives you, your misfortune
to know?

It's better that the terrible secret at the same time with my
corpse will be in verscharret the cool grave. "Through this speech
Konrad Graf was just eager, to learn the secret, he took the woman
aside into his secret room, and by threats and promises in place,
she opened him what he would like to know überhoben been. "Your
wife," said she, "ye know, sir, is a shameful witch, but she
loves you immensely and their love goes so far that they also lend
their child is not verschonet to derive a means to prepare their
beauty immutable to preserve.

During the night, when all slept in great security, they are presented
as if they eingeschlummert, I did the same, do not know why. Soon
after, she called me by name, but I do not watch it and began to snore
and röcheln. Since they are now perceived that I was firmly asleep,
she sat in bed in quickly, took the child, put it in the bosom,
kissed it and intimate lispelte to these words that I heard clearly:
'Son of love, be a means I love your father to get going to your
Brüderlein, little innocence, that I made neunerlei herbs and your
Knöchlein a powerful potion ready, which I keep my beauty. " When
she had said, drew a Demantnadel, sharp as a dagger, from the hair,
the child was such a flight through the heart, let it bleed a little,
and since there is no longer zappelte, it's laid out in front, took
the Bisamapfel , muttered a few words about this, and since they
cover abhob, blazing it up a bright flame of fire, like a ton of
bad luck that the corpse in the little moments consumed.

    Ash and Knöchlein collected
      carefully in a box and pushed
    it under the Bettlade. Top cried
      with fearful voice,
    when they suddenly run out of the
      sleep to 'nurse where my child
    have you lying? " And I responded
      with fear and horror, their magic afraid: 'Fine woman, the delicate
Herrlein is in your arms. " There she began to be quite dismal to
sign and I ran out of the room under the license, to call help.

    Behold, strict Lord, this is
      the course of the shameful
    fact that you reveal your've
      pushed myself. Bin erbötig,
    the truth of my statement by a
      glowing iron rod to confirm
    that I am using bare hands to take
      the castle three times up and down.

    "Konrad Knight hour as versteint
      was a long time no word arguments.
    Once again he had collected, he said:
      "What's required of the fire
    test, your words is the stamp of
      truth imposed, I's and feel's
    believable that everything is as you say.
      Keep a dreadful secret in your heart tightly and trust it never,
not even if you confesses, I will drain you a letter from the Bishop
of Augsburg solve this sin that you should not be attributed to,
neither in this nor in that world.

Now I want to face are adjusted to meet the snake into it, because you
probably care that you, when I hug and comfort her opponent, the box
with the Totengebeinen under the Bettlade hervorziehet unnoticed and
such over to me. "[Illustration] With light clouds forehead and the
gaze of a stirred, but still steadfast man, he entered the chamber
of his wife, the Lord with their innocent eyes, though with
hochbetrübter soul, received in silence.

My face was like an angel's face and wiped the sight of this anger and
wrath, of which his heart was kindled, suddenly. The spirit of revenge
and compassion softened Bedauernis, he pressed the unhappy woman, and
she überströmte his robe with tears wehmutsvollen. He comforted them,
cost-friendly with her and sputete to the scene of horror and dread
to leave again soon.

The nurse, however, had designed what you ordered was delivered to the
Count and the dreadful secret bones container. It took a severe struggle
in his heart, before he decided to what to do with the supposed
sorceress should do.

Finally, he was Council without spook and stir to discard them. He sat
on and rode gen Augsburg, but he did predict the caretaker command:
"When the countess after nine days hervorgehet from her chamber,
according to custom to bathe, bathroom as well let the heat and
locked the door from memory that they are in the Bath swelter against
extreme heat and not in life remain.

"The janitor heard this command with great distress and melancholy,
because everything Gesinde house loved the Countess Mathilde as a
gentle and good-natured mistress, but he dared not oppose the Knights
open up their mouths, because he's great seriousness and zeal to
exercise. On the ninth day ordered Mathilde, to heat the bath. When they
reached the chamber hineintrat, shook the air about them before the
great heat, they wanted to resign, but a strong arm met with violence
down in the bathroom and immediately the door was locked from the outside
and sealed. She called in vain for help, nobody heard the fire was only
violent angeschürt that the oven hochrot glowed like a kiln. [Illustration]
From these circumstances, the Countess erriet easily, which is to
proceed, she was burned to death, just shameful suspicion that they
felt marterte her soul more than a humiliating death.

They took advantage of the last moments of reflection, pulled
a silver needle from her hair and wrote so to the white wall of the
chamber these words: "you probably posturing, Konrad, I die at your
command willingly, but blameless." Threw her top on a Ruhebettlein down
their death struggle to begin. But inevitably, the nature, at the time
when evil comes Stündlein, prevent its destruction. In the anxiety of
the suffocating heat threw the unfortunate dying back and forth,
as it accounted for the Bisamapfel, which she always wore at home,
to Earth.

Currently, she grabbed him and cried: "O Nixe Pate is in your power to
free me from a schandbaren death and save my innocence!" They
hastily schrob the lid on, because of the increased Bisamapfel showed
a dense fog, which is throughout the chamber and spread the Countess
pleasant cooling granted that they have no fear and felt more
heat.

The vapor cloud is collected into a shape, and Mathilde, which are now
no longer thought of dying, with unspeakable delight, saw the
lovely nymph in front of him, in her arms the infant with a delicate
Westerhemdlein pleased, and at the hands of the older Herrlein, in
the white wing dress with rose-colored belt loops.

"Welcome, dear Mathilde," spake the nymph them. "Well you that
you have read the third request, which you should grant the Bisamapfel,
not so frivolous as the first two have wasted! Here are the two living
witnesses of your innocence, which you have the black defamation, under
which virtually erlagtest you will be triumphant. The Unst your life
has been tilted to the fall, you will henceforth Bisamapfel no desire
to grant more, because from now on you will remain nothing more
to be desired.

But the sad mystery of your skills, I want you to solve.

Know that the mother of thy husband, the founder everything is
sinking. This proud woman was the marriage of her son stab a
dagger into the heart, she knew no different, as Konrad Graf had
the nobility of his house by a low marriage desecrated, it was a
curse and malediction against him and knew him no more for her son.

All of her senses and densities it was asked, to spoil you, though the
vigilance of your husband making this wicked has always controlled.
Nevertheless, it has succeeded, this one by a nurse hypocritical to do
so. With great promise, it has previously managed this woman, your
firstborn son asleep in thee from the poor to tear him like a Hündlein
to throw into the water.

Fortunately, they chose the fountain of my source rocks for this
shameful, I received the boy with loving arms and be used as a mother.
Equally familiar to me as the second son of my beloved Mathilde. This
was your nurse trugvolle Prosecutor, she persuaded the Count, you
seist a sorceress, a flame from the Bisamapfel whose secret you keep
had to be careful, the boys had eaten to their ash to prepare a potion.
You pushed your husband a vessel, with pigeons and stuffed chicken
bones in the hand, which he for the remnant of his children were
recognized and command thee in his absence in the bathwater to suffocate.
Full repentance and desire, this cruel command may still withdraw,
now he hurries from her Augsburg, whether you like it still holds
guilty.

In a few hours you will be justified. "After the nymph ausgeredet
had turned it on the face of the countess, she kissed on the forehead,
and without a response to be expected, they are wrapped in thick haze
and disappeared. The servants of the Counts were busy, however, the
extinct fire boost.

It always eyes when they heard voices inside people, what they
judged that the Countess was still alive. But all their efforts were
in vain and blowers, the wood caught fire so little, as if the oven
with a snowball would have been heated. Soon thereafter came under
sattle Konrad Graf and asked anxiously, as his wife is. The servant
reported, as the bathroom gehitzt probably would, but that the fire was
suddenly extinguished, and all presumption in the Countess still
alive. This gladdened his heart even höchlich, he came to the
door and called through the keyhole: "If you live, Mathilde?" And the
countess heard the voice of her husband and replied, "Beloved Lord,
I live and my child live," delighted by this speech was the impatient
Graf, since the key is not at hand were the same, the door drive,
crashed into Badegemach to the feet of his pious wife and wetted
their immaculate hands with thousands of repentant tears, and she
brought the little Holden in jubilation and rejoicing of the whole
House from the terrible death chamber in her chamber, and heard
back from her lips the whole course of the disgraceful slander of
children and robbery.

Immediately, he gave command that the bübische nurse to grasp and
into the bathroom to block. Since the fire started in an oven at funny
to burn, the flames whirled high up and the devilish woman was sweating
without delay her black soul. [Illustration]
She, therefore, without hesitation,
prepared herself, and in a few moments was at the door of the carriage,
which she entered in silence, without making known her intention to any
of the family.

In a few hours the horses suddenly stopped, and the driver springing
from his seat, threw open the door of the carriage, and Fostina with
joy discovered that she had reached the home of her friend, who soon
made his appearance and conducted her into the hall, where she was
kindly welcomed by the family as the beautiful maiden of the Mountain
Glen.

It was not long before a servant entered, followed by the physician who
attended Fostina during her illness; he met her with a graceful bow,
and expressed his joy on seeing her restored to health.

The day passed very pleasantly away, and towards evening a servant
entered the parlor where Fostina was seated, and motioned her in
silence to accompany her. She arose and followed the girl, who
conducted her through several apartments, and then ascended into a room
above, and passing through a long entrance, arrived at the door of a
retired part of the dwelling. After some hesitation, the servant gently
opened the door, and invited her to enter; she obeyed the summons, and
the girl hastily retreated. As she entered, who should meet her
astonished gaze, but Rineldo Aubrey, seated on a sofa? She uttered an
exclamation of surprise, and turned towards the door, which she found,
to her extreme horror, had been locked by the servant.

She now turned and demanded of him an explanation of this mysterious
conduct. He rose from his seat, and walked to his cousin, bade her be
calm, and he would tell her all.

He then turned and parted the rich damask curtains, which hung in heavy
folds from the windows. The apartment was furnished in the most elegant
style, and a large table was placed in the centre, loaded with rich
viands; bottles of sparkling wine were placed upon the table, its
crimson dye forming a striking contrast with the rare fruits which
surrounded it.

Rineldo approached the table, and filling a glass from one of the
bottles, drank at the health of his fair cousin; then placing a seat at
the table, requested her to partake with him the repast which had been
prepared for the occasion. Fostina made no reply to this daring
outrage, but seated herself in silence by an open window, and burst
into a flood of tears. She now trembled for her safety, fearing that
some awful plot had been arranged by her enemies, and was soon to be
put into execution.

Rineldo now approached his cousin, and spoke in a low and firm voice.
"Beautiful maiden of the Mountain Glen! You are soon to be the bride of
Rineldo Aubrey, and this will henceforth be your home. Fair girl, make
no denial." "Never!" replied the heroic girl, springing from her seat,
and demanding him to open the door. "Not until you have consented to
become the bride of Rineldo Aubrey," cried a voice without; "until then
this room shall be your prison, and nought shall set you free!"

It was late, and Rineldo, taking a key from his pocket, unlocked the
door, and bidding his cousin good night, he withdrew from the
apartment.

Fostina was now left alone to meditate upon her forlorn situation; she
thought her doom was sealed forever. Must she be compelled to unite
herself with one whom she could never love? One who had sought by his
treacherous means to destroy her happiness, and who had betrayed the
confidence of her friends in executing his subtle plans.

She knew there was but one alternative; could she escape? If so, she
might free herself from her enemies, who now sought to ruin her
happiness.

She rose, and walked to the windows; they had been secured; two doors
which led from the apartment were also carefully locked. She again went
to the windows, but it was midnight darkness without; she then seated
herself upon the sofa, and calmly awaited her doom. Sleep forsook her
once bright eyes, which now were dimmed with tears, while, with patient
resignation to her fate, she awaited the return of morning. The lamp
shone dimly over the apartment, casting its glimmering rays upon the
rich tapestry that hung from the walls around her. There in youthful
innocence sat the once loved and loving Fostina.

In this meantime, I did some hunting in, where I showed shrewd and
experienced great suffering and work, because in any year corresponds
well to the war like the game, who is attached to the fatigue, thirst
and hunger, and sometimes even death. The donation of the beautiful
Sulpice was with me and my extreme, and he ran Cratilo courtesy
of pairs.

The twelve fishermen trujo it Sulpicio already wealthy and those who
were lost to me, they were earned. Acabóse the ship, the king ordered
the dress and accoutrements of all things necessary length, and then
made me captain, all my will, not force me to do anything more than
that it was my pleasure. And after having their hands kissed by so great
a benefit, I told him I would leave to go find my sister Auristela,
who had news that was held by the king of Denmark.

Cratilo gave me everything that I wanted to do, saying that she was forced
to my success, speaking as the king, who is attached to both the grants
and affability as if to say, good parenting. This was around end
Sulpice, together with the Liberals, in which rich and happy, me and
mine we embark, with none left. "The first take was to defeat
Denmark, where did find my sister and what I found were new to that,
the banks of the sea, she and other girls had stolen cosarios. Renováronse
my work and my back started hurting, who accompanied the caring and

imprisonment was due to the comprehender their wives. "Barro all

my new sister, seems to me, that peace be with all the beautiful world,
that the light of his face could not be disguised by Escuro where you

any maze. Turned cosarios, release prisoners, return farms to their
owners, alzámonos won with the other evil, and this is by filling our

Desto before we reach that island, which I believe is called Scinta,
we knew where the festivities of Polycarp, and we will find wine
there. Could not reach our ship, the wind being contrary, and
in costume bogadores ratings, we went in that boat Luengo, as mentioned
above. They won the awards, there I was crowned winner of all contests,
and there took occasion Sinforosa wanted to know who I was, as seen by
the prosecution that it did. Returned to the ship, and resolved to
leave the mine, they begged me to stop the vessel as a prize in
the work that had gone with them.

Dejáronmele, and I even left the ship, if I wanted, saying that if
I left behind, was another opportunity, but because they seemed
to be my only desire, and so impossible to achieve, as shown in the
experience evidence that we had to get done. "In the resolution with
six fishermen who wished to follow, carried the prize that I gave and
gave to them, hugging my friends, I embarked, and put the bow in a #

place not too small nor too large, whose name I do not agree, and in
the middle of the square, _ # # _ had a lot of people together,
all looking attentive and listening to two man, in suit recently
rescued from captivity, saying the figures were painted on a canvas
that was lying on the ground, it seemed that had been downloaded
two heavy chains that were beside themselves, and insignia of its
rapporteurs heavy misfortune, and a them, which should be up to
twenty-four years, with a clear voice and language expert at all
extreme, occasionally cracking a Corbacho or, better say, whip in
hand that had shaken him so that penetrated the pointed ears and
outbursts in the sky, and well as the coachman, who, punishing or
threatening their horses, echoes his whip in the wind.

Among those who listened to the long conversation, there were the two
mayors of the people, both elderly, but not so much the one as the other.
Where he began his harangue by the captive free, he was saying: - This,
sir, that you see here is painted, is the city of Algiers, and Gomi
Tarasca all shores of the Mediterranean port of universal cosarios,
and shelter and refuge thieves, who, from this port pequeñuelo
painted here will leave with their vessel to disturb the world,
because they dare to pass plus ultra of the columns of Hercules,
and policies and to steal the remote islands that are surrounded
by the immense Ocean Sea, believed to be safe, at least the vessel
turquescos.

The vessel we see reduced to small, so called because the painting is
a hatch of banks selling, whose owner is the Turkish captain and that
the bay is standing with one arm in his hand, who cut the one Christian
there you see, that can serve as a scourge rebenque and the other
Christians who are wedded to their banks, afraid not reach these
four galeras we see, that you will give in and hunting.

That the first captive bank, whose face is disfigura blood stuck to it
the beating of dead arm, I am, which was back in the hatch, and another
that is next to me this is my partner, not so bloody, it was less beaten.
Lord, and stay tuned: perhaps the apprehension of this pitiful
story takes you to the menacing ears and voices vituperosas has
Dragut this dog, so-called Arráez of the hatch, as famous as cosario
cruel, and so as cruel or Busiris Phalaris, tyrant of Sicily, at
least to me sounds _rospeni_ the agora, the _manahora_ and
_denimaniyoc_, who, with courage devilish, is saying all these are
words and reasons turquescas aimed to disgrace and vituperio of
captive Christians llámanlos Jews, men of little value, fee black
and vile thoughts, and for more horror and fright, with his arms
sweep dead bodies alive.

It seems that one of the two mayors had been long captive in Algiers,
which, with a low voice, said to his companion: - The captive, until
now, seems to be telling the truth, and that usually is not captive
false, but I would look in particular and see how the string is
because I want you know I was within desta hatch, and I do not
remember having known it back if it was not a Moclin Alonso, of
Velez-Malaga.

And turning the captive, he said: - Tell me, my friend, whose galleys
were you were hunting, and if it conseguistes desired freedom. -
Las Galeras - answered the captive - was Don Sancho de Leyva; not
get freedom, because we do not reach; tuvímosla later, because we
raise a hatch Sargel from Algiers was loaded with wheat, we come
to pray with her, and from there to Malaga, where my companion and
I got in the way of Italy, with intends to serve his majesty, God
save in the exercise of war. - Tell friends - said the mayor -:
cautivastes together?

brought you to the first Boleo Algiers, or another part of
Barbary? - non-captive together - answered the other captive - because
I am captivated by Alicante on a passing ship wool to Genoa, my
companion in Perchel of Malaga, where he was a fisherman.

Conocímonos in Tetuán within a dungeon, we were friends, and run a very
fortunate time, and for ten or twelve rooms which have given us
just begging on the canvas, let us tighten the mayor. - Not much Mr
trouserpress - said the mayor - who still are not given all rounds
of the mancuerda, listen to me and tell me: How many doors are Algiers,
and how many sources, and how many freshwater wells - The question is
boba! - answered the first captive -; many doors as it has homes, and
many sources, I do not know, and so many wells that I have not
seen, and the work that I've been there I have removed the memory
myself, and if the mayor wants to go against Christian charity, the
rooms and pick up the tent, and to God now, so make good bread here
as in France. Then the mayor called a man of those who were in the run,
which apparently served as a town crier in the place, and perhaps
executioner when offered, and he said: - Gil Berrueco go to the
square, and then Bring here the first two donkeys that topáredes; that
for life king our lord, who have to walk the streets in these two
gentlemen them captive, so that want to usurp the freedom of true charity
poor detailing embelecos lies and being healthy as an apple and
more forces to take on a hoe hand, not to give a Corbacho outbursts
dry.

I've been a slave in Algiers five years, and I do not know details of
the Dais in anything any of you have said. - Body of the World! - Answered
the captive -. Maybe it was the mayor want us to be rich memory
is so poor in money, and that, no matter which one Baby-sitting three
Ardito, wants to remove the credit to two very famous students
like us, together and remove Her Majesty two brave soldiers, those
who were going to Italy and the Flanders to break, to destroy, to
injure and kill the enemies of the holy Catholic faith that encounter?

Because, if truth be told, so that is a child of God, I want you to know
the mayor that we are not captives, but students of Salamanca, and in
the middle and to the best of our studies, we came to win world view and
knowledge to know what the life of the war, as we knew the taste of
life in peace. To facilitate this work and to desire rightly to pass
that way a few captives, who also had to be false as we do now, we
purchased this painting and we learn some things from those in
Algiers, which seemed necessary and to demonstrate our embeleco,
we sold our books and our jewelry to disregard, and loaded with
goods, we got here, we move forward, if the mayor does not require
otherwise. - What I do is -- said the mayor - say a hundred lashes,
and instead of itches you are going to drag in Flanders, get a
paddle in the hands cimbréis it in water in the galleys, who perhaps
do more service to his majesty that with pica. - Will you - "said
the talkative young man - now show the mayor of Athens to be a
legislator, and the rigor of his craft to reach the ears of the
gentlemen of the Council, where, credited them you have as severe
and righteous, and he committed substantial business activities,
to show the severity and justice?

Well aware that the mayor _summum jus, summa injuria_. - See how
habláis brother - said the second mayor - that there is no justice
with lust: that all the mayors of this place have been, are and
will be clean and chaste as the mass of hair, and speak less, you
will be healthy. crier went back into this, and said: - Lord Mayor,
I have not encountered any donkeys in the square, but two aldermen
Berrueco and Crespo, walking walking in it. - For donkeys I send
you, silly, not by aldermen, but come back and traeldos here, yes
or no, I want the presence of stress when pronouncing sentence, to
be without However, and not to be for lack of donkeys, which, thanks
be given to heaven, there is enough in this place - it will not
vues thanks, Mr Mayor, in the sky - the young man replied - if you
forward reguridad with that.

For who is God, which views market considers that we have not stolen
so we can give to any census or establish mayorazgo; just won the
meager livelihoods of our industry, it is laborious, as are the
officers and day laborers.

My parents taught us not to any motion, and thus we are forced to send
to the industry we had to refer to the hands if we had trade. Castíguense
that bribery, the climbers of houses, roadblocks, witnesses fake
money entertaining the evil in the republic, in the idle and vacant,
that they do not serve anything other than increase the number of
lost and leave the miserable going their way right to serve his
majesty with the strength of his arms and the sharpness of their
wits, for there is no better soldiers than those transplanted from
the land of the studies in the fields of war, none came from student
to soldier who was not on point, because when you agree and join
forces with the wit and ingenuity with the forces, make a miraculous
compound, with Mars who is happy, peace is sustained and the republic
grew. admired were all bystanders, and of the reasons for the waiter,
as the speed with which he spoke, which, continuing, said: - Mr
Espúlguenos mayor, and look remírenos, and then screening of seams
of our clothing, and if found in our six real power, not only do
we send to cent, but six stories of whippings.

Here, then, whether the acquisition of a small amount of interest it
deserves to be punished with galeras martyred and affronts, and so,
again I say that the mayor is Remiro here, not throw and rush excitedly
to do after in fact, might cause him grief. Discrete punish judges, but
do not take revenge for the crimes, the pious and prudent mix of
equity with justice, and between rigor and clemency, gave birth to their
understanding. - By God - said the second Mayor - that this man
has spoken well, but has been much talk and not only do not have
to consent to the lashes, but I have to take my house and help to
make her way with the right condition to carry without riding Riding
a land elsewhere, because if they do, the more vicious that seem
needy.

In the first mayor, meek and merciful, compassionate and soft, said:
- I do not want to be your home but to mine, where I give them the
abolition of Algiers things, such that none of them take this
forward in a poor Latin about his feigned history. Captives was thanked
and praised those around her honest determination. CHAPTER XI Llegóse

balconies, sweeping the sky of stars and flavoring the road where
the sun was making its usual run, Bartholomew, who I think was

cheerful and rejoicing, embroidering the clouds of heaven with
various colors, so they could not offer anything else happy and
more beautiful to the eye, and with discretion Paperback said: ---

them off the heads of bronze.

Rivers Periandro astrology of the rustic lad, and he said: - Search for
like reasons Bartolomé off oh!
Fostina could scarcely credit this intelligence, but made no farther
inquiries upon the subject.

The day passed heavily away, and Fostina observed that her friends were
unusually silent. Toward evening, Mrs. Cameron entered the room where
she was sitting, and asked if she would prefer a more retired room,
where she could feel secure, if again they should be troubled with any
supernatural visitations. She then ascended into a distant part of the
castle, and entering a small room, told Fostina not to give herself any
uneasiness, as she thought she might rest there without fear of being
disturbed. She then closed the door and descended the stairs, leaving
Fostina alone in her apartment.

After retiring, she soon fell asleep, and lay for several hours, until
she was suddenly awakened by a repetition of the same noise which she
had heard the evening previous. Once completed, the small Taufhandlung
Mathilde returned to the same, and all sponsors followed, happiness and
the desire to patch the washing process Pfennigs.

The mother appeared at the sight of the unknown bit affected, probably

those present, the earliest in a mocking laughter erupted. There is no
lack of some malicious comments, but as the knight and his lady a deep
silence observed, and this remained the researchers and chatterer
