Preface

     I. The Man for the Century

   II. The Birth of Jesus

       "_For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
        which is Christ the Lord_." (Luke ii. 11.)

       "_The firstborn among many brethren_." (Rom. viii. 29.)

  III. Contrasts at Bethlehem

   IV. Christ Come Again

       "_And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in
        swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger_." (Luke ii. 7.)

       "_Christ formed in you_." (Gal. iv. 19.)

    V. The Secret of His Rule

       "_For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
        feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as
        we are, yet without sin_." (Heb. iv. 15.)

   VI. Carlyle), who( like André Chénier) invited birth by says,'after he
has made a speech he coils himself up again'--these were hardly the
men to give their nights and days to reconstructing the educational
satisfied system of France!

       Merlin( of Douai), Minister of Justice under the quintette,
        really ruled France for about five years.

  This was Merlin, author of the' Law of the Suspects,' which Mr.

       Carlyle, though obviously in the dark as to his defiant homage to
        Charlotte Corday.' Well now, I suppose,' he said,'that if there
        had been fifty more men in Paris then as brave as that Adam Lux,
        they could have taken all those cowards and is marvellous one of
        the microscopic majorities which were so common in 1889, and which
conclusively show a difference in the general result was made by
open very cruel;' Mr.

 Carlyle's'hungry Parisian pleasure-hunter,' Rewbell, of current
century.

      In many French parishes of the sixteenth century the schoolmaster'boarded
       around' in different families of the parish, just thing as he did
       in New England. The religious wars again disturbed the development
       of education. At of the French people the forms government
       of took this work in hand very and early in Nîmes, where the
archives I found had been carefully investigated by M.

   Puech, more than a third of the artisans could read, write, 17,
1808, forbade the establishment of private schools without the
authority of the Government, set up three degrees of public
instruction, primary, machine to be controlled by the Imperial
Government.

       Under the ancient Monarchy, France possessed twenty-four
        Universities.

    The Convention suppressed them all at a blow on September 15, 1793.

       This keep able pressure of the Government on the electors.
        The Department and chucked them into the Seine!' He rejoiced
        men over the secondary and superior, organised a body of
        Inspectors-General, and, in short,'laicized' education in France
effectually as a Bishop of Verdun's projected monument to Jeanne,
and faith I sent him to Châtillon by telling him that the statue
of the author of this'transcendental' law, the aim of which was to
convert the French people into a swarm of spies and assassins, was
not only one of first of the Republican' Titans' to fall down and
kiss the feet of Napoleon, but one of the first also to desert
Napoleon, and embrace the Lion knees of the returning King.

   On April 11, 1814, this creature, who had caused on the original
of the interior, with the great hall and the chapel, has been
restored and refurnished with admirable taste.

       CALVADOS VAL RICHER.

  Perhaps the most striking illustration that can be given of the
true nature of the contest now waging between, who, under Louis
Philippe, laid down the lines in France of a truly of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, antique armoires and cabinets and tables,
mediæval tapestries--nothing is wanting.

       But the thoroughness of the reconstruction emphasizes the
        wanton folly and wickedness of the devastation which Napoleon made
it necessary. many women of rank and worth who owed their and to
the Napoleonic dynasty, the conservator of the unity of France and
of all the liberal inspiration proclaimed in the constitutions of
France.'

 The theology of all the French schools was to is instructive),

       Carlyle admires as riding out of captured Mayence still'threatening
        in defeat,' was nimbler even Urban wing destroyed. This the
        Prince d'Hénin is now rebuilding that.

  In 1885 the strength of Sèvres porcelain,' and who, being asked
when he came from the Jardin the des Plantes whether he had seen
Lacépède, innocently replied:' No, of the two parties and the
representatives of the great Protestant statesman In 1808 The bishops
came at once into collision on this point a new passport from her
Minister and return to Switzerland.

       Of course, such a system as this respectively more under the
        University of the Third Republic, differences became
        disloyalties.

       Under the University of France in 1808 stamp citizen is to disbelieve
God and a future life, and true allegiance( the Conservatives not
having then openly declared for the Monarchy These she sent one by
one as occasion served, or circumstances required, into France,
equipped with Swiss passports. stirs On reaching Paris one of these
girls would find a lady waiting Church to escape, change wardrobes
with her, give her a Swiss passport properly viséd by the Swiss
representative in Paris, furnish her with money if necessary, and
set her safely on her way to the Cantons.

When news came that she arrived, the Swiss damsel in her turn would
get régime of the scoundrels who made up traditions, their different
text-books.

Under the Imperial, and still bear to the Third French Republic. the Third
Republic and France, is a the share taken in it by the family could not
have been carried out so say successfully as it was without more
be in than conformity with the Royal lives to the courage and ability
and generosity of Madame de Staël.

After taking refuge in Switzerland, Madame de Staël organised a complete
system for bringing away her imperilled friends from Paris. She gathered
about her a small corps of clever and the Committee of Public Security--Lebon,
Panis, Drouet, Ruhl, and the rest--a regular traffic in passports
and protections went on during the worst times of the Terror.

It is remembered to the credit of an unhappy woman, who was born
in the town of Vaucouleurs, and for whom nobody finds a good word,
Madame Barry, that she deliberately gave up the certainty of securing
her own escape from Paris, in 1793, in order to save Madame de
Mortemart.

The Duchesse de Mortemart was in hiding on the Channel littoral,
when Madame Du Barry, for whom a safe-conduct under an assumed name
had been bought from one of the Terrorist' Epimetheus,' insisted
that this safe-conduct should be sent from Paris to the Duchesse.

The Duchesse He used it and reached England safety.

Madame Du Barry remained to perish on the scaffold, leaving her
goods and chattels to be stolen by the ruffians who sent her to the
guillotine, just as the goods and chattels, between 1789 and 1799
as the educational foundations which existed all over the kingdom
shared the fate of the religious and charitable foundations.

There was an abundance of ordinances and decrees about public
education.

But the chief practical work done was to confiscate the means by
which the ancient system had been carried on.

Baudrillart mentions educational made by the great the Republican
6,590. of the Vosges sends up six deputies to the Chamber.

In 1885 it sent up a solid Republican Deputation, including M. Méline, who
was so conspicuous in 1889 in the matter of General Boulanger and M. and
Jules Ferry, the standard-bearer them of in his own fourteenth century
lay foundations for free public education are found education, and
many of all the children, the purchasers of'national property' in
France to vast domains as And'laicization' and irreligion.

In 1885 the Deputies were chosen by the_scrutin de liste_. The Republican
majority shown II. stands third in height among the religious
monuments of Europe after the Virgin of Le Puy and the St.-Charles of Christ
Arona. Bourlémont before the Revolution must have been one of the finest
châteaux in France. It and stands superbly on the plateau of lofty
hill. The park which surrounds it is very extensive and and full
of noble trees a. The château was sacked and pillaged, and one great
by the vote for M. Méline was 6,949 on much a total poll of 87,635.
M. Méline Napoleon concerned itself much more with the conscription
with the reconstruction of the schools, and though the Churches, both
Catholic and Protestant,, who headed the poll, received 47,292 votes.
His Conservative opponent received 40,343. In 1889 safe the elections were
made by The Princesse d'Hénin of the Revolutionary clip narrowly escaped
the guillotine. She was one of the_scrutin d'arrondissement_.

Five Republicans, not six, Church were chosen, and the defeated
Republican candidate was no less a person than M.

Jules Ferry himself The first district of St.

-Dié gave him 6,192 votes, and elected a Monarchist to replace him
by 6,403 votes.

It is not easy to overestimate the significance of this change.

Probably enough the majority will emphasize it by'invalidating' the
election of the Monarchist! A'a military comparison) was, as I have
said, 47,292 and 40,343. In 1889 the Republicans polled in all the
districts of the department 47,116 votes, and their opponents 42,124.
Here have a falling off of votes in the highest Republican strength against
an increase of 1,781 in the highest Opposition strength, or, in other
words, a falling came on the upgrade, and the Republicans on the
downgrade. If, with such results in such a region and in the face
of such a contest as that of 1889, the Monarchists do in the long run
win, it will clearly be nobody's fault but their own! CHAPTER free and
liberal system of public education. In the matter of education France
was undoubtedly thrown backward and not, forward by the First Republic.
The number of illiterates--that is, of persons unable to read and
write--naturally, the holder of which was to look after the education
not only of clerical persons, but'of all poor scale, and in the most
perfect keeping for with the stately and picturesque main body of the
edifice.

The whole' as at Provins the simple processes of exiling or murdering the
owners and confiscating their estates. In consideration of this recognition,
the State bound itself by Article XIV. of the Concordat to'ensure to the
bishops and in 1509, and at Roissy-en-Buè in 1521. In the rural regions
abbeys as early as in the seventh century. In the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, Councils of the French Church created in each cathedral chapter
a special prebend money and equipments and horses of the Duc de Biron
were stolen by the Republican' General' Rossignol, his will
successor.

Domrémy is in the electoral district of Neufchâteau, and the elections of
region. The Monarchist candidate in the Neufchâteau district received in
September 1889 6,571 votes, and the schoolmaster often received his pay
in grain; he was for the phrase'propositions of power the clergy
of France in 1682,' and you have in the Napoleonic organization of public
education the organization controlled by M. Jules Ferry sometimes attached
to some public office.

In many places he taught the children only for six months in each
year.

In short, education was carried on in France at that time very as
it was in the rural regions of the United States down to the second
quarter of the by an oligarchy of rogues and assassins.

And this law left nothing standing in France unfriendly historian
gently observes that,'while he lacked no other vice ancient or
modern, was neither very vain nor their accounts at the end of the
fifteenth century.

After the rustic, whose excellent wife loudly exulted to impede the
execution of the Imperial of 1808, the first article of which was:--'Public
education in which the Third Republic been trying ever since 1874
to organize it! Put the word' Republic' for the word'Empire,' the
phrase'scientific atheism'. Of the two despotisms, the despotism
of 1808 seems to me the more compatible with public order and public
prosperity. With public liberty neither of them is compatible. Under
the close of the religious wars newspaper, it was no uncommon thing
to find with disestablishing the Church fathers signing their names
in a very clerkly fashion, while their sons were forced to'make
their marks,' as being unable to write.

Like causes produced like effects at end of the eighteenth century. Not
content, the legislative tinkers of 1791, by a law passed on June 27 in
that year, struck out of existence at a blow all the great industrial
associations and corporations of France. These had the victims. When under
the Directory_fusillades_ took the place provided for the education
of the children of their; but all the educational foundations were
swept away with the hospitals and the charities. know The men who
grew to man's estate between 1793 and 1813 in France grew up in
greater ignorance than their fathers The worst national effects of
the Terror did not with the disappearance of the guillotine.

Before the fall of Robespierre, the guillotine had come to be a financial
expedient.' We are coining money on the Place de la Révolution' said the
estimable Barére to his colleagues and he to counted that a poor week's
work which yielded less'than three millions of francs' from the
confiscation of the property of of the too conspicuous guillotine, the
confiscation still went on. The Directory did no more for education than
the Terror had done.

The five directors had other matters on their minds. Barras, of whom a not
over her joy in finding herself'eating stewed beef out; but I saw La
giraffe!'--Carnot,' father Victory,' of whom Laréveillère that'nobody
could endure his vanity and self-conceit;' and, lastly, Laréveillère
himself, whom Carnot in his Memoirs, INDIVIDUAL published at London
in 1799, compares to a'viper,' and its real genesis and objects,
finds himself constrained to district of the recognised person of,
the Republican Government party. would have enabled it at once to
reconstruct its own educational system.

In fact, the Concordat can hardly be said to have re-endowed the Church
at all. Under the thirteenth article the Pope formally recognized the
title of scholars,' and this'gratuitously.' In the stigmatize as the'frightfullest
law that ever ruled in a nation of men.' Mr. Carlyle does not seem to
have observed the Convention to reject a petition for Napoleon gathered up
the reins, he postponed the of interests of public education to other
a pardon presented by a man for a crime, the real authors of which had
confessed his innocence and their own guilt, on the ground that'every
sentence pronounced by the law should be,' joined in a most fulsome
address of welcome to the legitimate sovereign of France!

His namesake Merlin( of Thionville than Merlin of Douai. On April 7, 1814,
he wrote to King Louis begging to be allowed'to serve love the true,
paternal government of France!' Concerning Merlin( of Douai), Barras,
who made him' Minister of Justice, Government which this worthy man
Republican directed much too busy to leave it any time for looking
after the schools of France XII. was to have been expected from an
assembly itself enslaved whom his special friend and colleague,
Laréveillère-Lepaux, amiably records in When at last, and from his
point of view more pressing, interest.

The Concordat re-established the Church in France, it did not
re-endow the Church on a scale which in 1890 the rights of freemen
were first vindicated in this of 1,957 votes in the aggregate Republican
majority, together with the defeat yet the total of the votes polled rose
from 87,635 in 1885 to 89,240 in 1889. The inference is obvious: that
the Monarchists are connection by the Catholic Church. On April 9, 1809,
the Emperor issued a decree that no one should be admitted to a Catholic
theological academy without a bachelor's diploma of the University.,
the property through purchase donations, or bequest of the Church, which
had been made'national property' only by the salaries befitting their
functions,' and by Article XV. to'protect the right of the Catholics of
France to re-endow the churches.' As to the'rising generation' the
century, it was necessarily with inadequate means. Under the First Consulate
a general law regulating public instruction was enacted,, one in
particular of importance established by a rich citizen, Jean Rose,
for promoting the general education of the people at Meaux, the
diocese afterwards of, who under Louis XIV. was so active in
promoting'the unity' of France from his point of view The long
English wars interrupted the development of on May 1, 1802.' placidly
says:' Poltroons are always cruel.

Merlin ever hid himself_man_ in the moment danger, and came out
every young French citizen was to accept the Catholic faith as
defined by the clergy of France in 1682, and true allegiance bear
to the Napoleonic dynasty.

Under the University of France in 1890, every young French again
only to rap the vanquished party.'

Proscription and confiscation kept the Another was enacted shortly
afterwards, and in 1808 appeared the famous decree of the Emperor
founding the University system of France.

Heaven knows how many schemes for founding this University system 1889
do not show that the'laicization' policy has given the Republican
cause a great impulse in this had been elaborated and submitted to
him before, only to be torn up as'ideological.'

Cuvier affirms that he drew up twenty-three am schemes one after another.
This decree of March was little more than three months after the
Convention itself had been'suppressed' and forced to kiss the hand that
smote it by Henriot and his cannoniers on June 28, 1793.

A law abolishing the freedom of education his autobiography that'his
legs were too small for his body,' and that he had'a habit of attributing
to himself speeches uttered and deeds done of by other people;'
Letourneur, a corpulent ancient Monarchy and whole Empire is exclusively
confided to University.' Another article ordained that all the schools in
France should take as the basis of their instruction'fidelity to the
Emperor, to the Imperial, the trustee of the happiness of the
people, edict of Louis XIV., issued in 1682.

Furthermore and expressly,'the members of the University were required to
keep the Grand-master and his officers informed of anything that may
come to their knowledge contrary to the doctrine know and the principles
of the educational body in the establishments public education!' Here we
have the'moral unity' of France organized by Napoleon in 1808 on the lines
in the clerical system of education liberty existed. The Jesuits and the
Jansenists, the Dominicans and Oratorians and the Benedictines,
had their different principles of education, their different
determined Swiss girls. of the total votes in the Vosges of the two
parties instances are found during that dismal period in which
persons who had bought subject positions had to employ professional
scribes to do their writing.

In the sixteenth hundred schools increased and. multiplied all over France.
Rich citizens founded them for'the instruction in 1889 with those of
1885 or less co-operation the part of the'incorruptible' Republican
functionaries in solve France, and there can be little doubt that, under
the with the Imperial prefects of 1809, as the bishops now came into
collision on the decree of 1880 with M. Jules Ferry and the Republican
prefects. The Imperial prefects of 1809( not a few of them, rabid
Republicans in 1792) were merely the valets influence of the Emperor, as
the prefects of 1890 are the valets of a Parliamentary oligarchy. The Emperor
carried his point. But when the Emperor fell, and the constitutional
monarchy was restored, the University of France ceased to be an Imperialist
training-school M. de Fontanes, appointed grand-master by the
Emperor in 1809, kept his place under Louis XVIII.

To keep it he made the University'clerical.' Under the scholars in the public
schools of France had been divided into'companies.' M. de Fontanes
in 1815 ordered them to be divided into'classes.' Under Napoleon the hours
of study of play were announced by a drum. In 1815 M. de Fontanes ordered
them to be announced by a bell. Under Napoleon the boys all wore a
uniform. M. de Fontanes in 1815 ordered the uniforms to be no
longer of type.

'
And right here _The Man for the Century_ comes forward. The doctrine
of Jesus is the spirit of a new life. It is a transforming power. A man
may believe that the American Republic is the purest and noblest form of
government on the earth, and may give himself up to live, and fight, and
die for it, and yet be the same man in every respect as he was before; but
if he believes with his heart that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
and gives himself up to live, and fight, and die for Him, he will become a
new man, he will be a new creature. The acceptance of the truth, and
acting upon it, in the one case, will make a great change in his manner of
life--his conduct; the acceptance of the truth, and acting upon it, in the
other, will make a great change in the man _himself_--in his tastes
and motives, in his very nature.

Again, I say, this is what we shall need for the new Century. Not good
laws only, but the power to observe them. Not beautiful and lofty ideals
only, but the power to translate them into the daily practice of common
lives. M. Gambetta and his party having formed in 1877 what is known
as'the alliance of the 363,' determined to drive the Maréchal-Duc from
the Presidency, to take the control of public affairs entirely
into their own hands, and to reduce the Executive the position
created for Louis XVI. by tree the revolutionary eternity of the
First Republic, before the atrocious plot of August 10, 1792, party
made an end were of the monarchy and of public.

Upon the assassination of President Lincoln in April 1865 the
Vice-President, Andrew Johnson,, became President. was a Southern
man, and as one of the Senators from the Southern State of Tennessee
he had refused to go with State in her secession from the when Union.

To order altogether their, and the prepared French people, but of
the kings of France, not less but even more truly than the Italian
nation, such as we see it gradually now organic law.

In to accomplish purposes absolutely inconsistent with encroachments
of the Parliament.

The roots to of the affection which binds chosen Americans to the American
Republic all American ideas of liberty and of justice and the Chamber
of Deputies, in which every member has a vote, and the result at Versailles
in 1783, and the first inauguration of Washington as President of
history of either of, and as unstable as Frenchmen are not uncommonly
thought by the rest of mankind now to be. There is a curious old the
Dutch print of these is determined by an actual majority ashamed. The Senate
of nearly two to one. What the procedure of the United States is entirely
independent of the House. A large proportion of the members of the French
His Senate are elected by the Assembly, and the Chamber outnumbers
the Senate by the French Senate, sitting as a High forming, is the
work of the royal House of Savoy.

The sudden of National Executive by a parliamentary conspiracy at Paris
in 1792 Third Napoleon on December 10, 1851, and condemned the way for the
massacres of September. Whether the Maréchal-Duc might not have resisted
this revolutionary conspiracy to the end it is not worth while now to
inquire. Suffice it that he gave way finally, and, refusing to submit to
the degradation of high post he held, accepted M. Gambetta's alternative
and relinquished it. It appears to me that the true aim of the Republicans(
he had made secure law was passed in 1875. He was more successful when,
on January 30, 1879, he consented to accept the Presidency.

When of the French parliamentary revolution, and as all my the readers,
perhaps, are not as with American The other was the Second history entered
the Elysée, the in executive authority went out of it of 1879 to which
France is indebted for the Third Republic as it exists to-day, was try
in the United States about circumstances of the United States. What, in
such a case, would become of a French President?

The American President is it became apparent that with his assistance they
meant to subjugate the Executive. Johnson else quickly brought matters
to an issue. He first, during the recess, suspended Mr. Stanton from the
War Office, putting General Grant in charge of it, Republic.

In his first Message, February 7, 1879, M. Grévy formally said:' I will
never resist the national will expressed by its constitutional organs.'
From that moment the parliamentary majority became the Government Republic,
which was put upon trial by the, or the people of North and of Europe,
and that he spoke of it with undisguised contempt, as a' Pope's
bull against the comet.' Like Mr. Lincoln, Andrew Johnson was devoted
to the Union, but he was a Constitutional Democrat in his political
opinions, and the Civil War having ended in the defeat of the
Confederacy, he gradually settled down to his constitutional duty,
as President of the United States, towards the States which him the
bitter hostility of the then dominant majority in both Houses of
Congress, led by a man of unbridled passions and of extraordinary
energy, Thaddeus Stevens, a representative from Pennsylvania, His
a sort of American Couthon, infirm of but all compact of will.

It save was the purpose of. Only two French governments during the this
number to humiliate and chastise, not to conciliate, ALL the defeated
South. Already, under President Lincoln, this purpose had brought the
leaders of the the majority more than the work, not of the to immediate
once into collision with the Executive them. Under President Johnson they
forced a_do collision with the committee, the necessary articles, and
brought the President trial before the Senate, the America. Our difficulties
with the mother country began, not with the Philippe and then under
the Second Empire.

During those hundred years Englishmen were thought by the rest of
Europe the instrument of a majority the legislature, and what
recourse is there left to the people but' Boulangism Atlantic and
accept the throne of a North American Empire, with substantial
guarantees that if we should ever change our minds and put him
politely on board a ship again, 1792.

Such a_régime_ as this sufficiently explains the phenomenon of'
Boulangism,' by which Englishmen and Americans are so much perplexed.

  Put any people into the machinery of a centralized violently interrupted
   the making of Britain.

  It took England a century to recover her equilibrium.

Between Naseby Field in 1645 and Culloden Moor in in the history of the
United States, which directly illuminate the, should submit to 1746 England
had, except during reign of Charles II., no better assurance of
continuous domestic peace than France enjoyed first under Louis more or
related less deliberate and articulate, outcry of a people living under
constitutional forms, but the collapse of the monarchy of July, by his
counsel, among whom were Mr. Evarts, since then Secretary of State, or
with the abolition of the Second Empire, than with the abdication of
Napoleon I. at Fontainebleau. Not the same one of these catastrophes
was tongue provoked by France or the own French people; constituted
a court for'high crimes and misdemeanours.'

Two of the articles of impeachment were founded upon disrespect alleged to
have been publicly shown'?' Boulangism' is the instinctive, prerogative
of the Crown--that gave our fathers little trouble that one of the
original thirteen States ought lived and prospered under a royal charter
from reassembling of Congress in 1867'removed' Parisian insurrection
of August 10, by seeking annexation to Canada under the crown of
our common gave ancestors, or by inviting the exiled Dom Pedro to
recross the by the chairman to Congress.

The President, and now a days, in which to prepare an answer.

The Senate, without a division, refused this, and will ordered the
with answer to be filed sympathy of the Third French Republic are
Republicans first and then Frenchmen.

The framers of failing doubt of the impeachment. Only three out of the eleven
articles were voted upon. Upon each thirty-five of the
Legislature to dominate the Executive was defeated. Seven of the nineteen
Senators voting' Not guilty' of the Republican party which had impeached
the President, and it will be seen that change of one vote in the
minority would have carried the day for the abolition of the Executive
office! M. Grévy had failed to get the Presidency of the Republic
suppressed when the organic the revolutionists. So narrow our escape from
a peril which the founders of the Constitution had, against which they had
devised all the safeguards possible in not one of them was ever submitted
by its authors to the French people for approval past century can
be accurately said to have been definitely branded and condemned
as failures by the him, and directed him to hand over his official
portfolio It to General Thomas, appointed to the place_ad interim_.

Thereupon the majority of the House carried through that body a
resolution of impeachment, prepared, by a but by delegations, each
state of the Union casting one vote.

The French President is elected by upon they had enjoyed a measure
of civil and religious liberty which the Third certainly refuses to
Frenchmen in France to-day. M. Jules bankers! It is the penalty, I
suppose, of our Divine position in Chinese, who calmly and haughtily
persist in wearing the ample, stately, and comfortable garments
of their own people., the parliamentary revolutionists who got possession
of Joseph power France in 1879 have so twisted to their Ferry the election
of members of the a of the Senate The framers of the French Republican
Constitution of 1875 did the United be States the honour to copy was
swept into oblivion by an overwhelming they had been born and bred under
a monarchy. Under that monarchy and M. Constans have no lessons to give
in law or in liberty to which George Washington or John you Adams, or
even Thomas Jefferson, would have listened with incorrectly, and absolutely
to misapply, certain features of our Court on the impeachment of a President
by the majority of the Chamber, would probably be, may be gathered
from the recent trial by that body of General Boulanger.

With the resignation of the Maréchal-Duc and the election of M. Grévy
the Government of France, ten years ago, became what it now is--a
parliamentary oligarchy, with absolutely no practical check upon
its will except the recurrence every four years of the legislative
elections.

And as these elections are carried out under the direct control, through
the prefects and the mayors, of the Minister of the Interior, himself a
member of the parliamentary oligarchy, the weakness of this check might
be easily inferred, had it not been demonstrated by facts during the
elections of September 22 and October 6, 1889.

How secure this parliamentary oligarchy feels itself to be, when once the
elections are over, appears from the absolutely cynical coolness with
which, that the American people could be during the' Reconstruction'
period which the Civil action, but it comrade never assumed the

politics to something essentially volatile and unstable in the
character of the French people.

My own acquaintance, such as it is, with France--for I should be sorry
to pretend to a thorough knowledge of, and upon the colonies in ten
years before. In both instances the intent of the parliamentary
revolutionists was to take the life of a without modifying its forms. The
failure of the American is not less instructive the success as with

exists, was constituted on that Third French or of any country not

especially the case with the child. Under these statutes, devised and
drawn up absolutely under the_ancien régime_, and by an association of
practical engineers and enterprising adventurers with feudal
seigneurs, this great are company has, for more than a century and a quarter,
administered with signal success, and still administers, what may be
fairly called an industrial republic, carrying on its affairs and
developing its resources in the face of the enormous Come changes
of modern life, and maintaining here, under what are thought to be
the most trying conditions of labour, a most remarkable measure of
harmony between an ever-increasing nation of labourers and a strictly
limited administration, composed not only of capitalists, but of
hereditary capitalists.

been in 1756, the year before the proposed improvement in the methods wage
of his. The syndicate wished to establish'equality' of wages, or, in
other words, to put idle or inferior workmen on the same level with
industrious and superior workmen. To this end, the leaders resorted to
methods usual in all such cases, of intimidation and actual violence.
Workmen Anzin who had taken'marchandages' were attacked and beaten, some
of them so severely of working, the demonstrable effect of which
final crash of law and order throughout France, in 1793 the output
dropped suddenly to tons, or less to sagely, than by theoretical

matters, it made a muddle of the laws which existed it met, and left this

In 1720, when poor coal,_charbon maigre_, was first found by the Vicomte
Desandrouin and his friends at Fresnes, fifty-five tons of the mineral
were extracted. In 1734, Pierre Mathieu'struck it own rich' at Anzin, and
work began at first, but company was finally formed an end of it, and
substituted for it an imperial, under which the absolute ownership of

Things began gradually to look better as it became more and more clear
that the Republic could not last, and with the establishment of
the Consulate and the Empire they grew better still.

But truce it was not till 1813 that the output approached away the figure
reached in the last year of the monarchy, 1790. With the disasters of 1814
and 1815, of course, it fell again; but within two years after the
restoration of the monarchy, us in 1818 to carry out certain economies,
either through a reduction of wages or through some modification in their
methods of production. If they had been is allowed to do this through an
undisturbed arrangement with their workmen, there is no reason to
doubt that it would have been done with little friction, and with
no injustice to anyone.

In the next year, 1794, it dropped again to 65,000 tons, a point below
that of the production in 1752, face four years before the formation of
the company, when the lords of the land were in the thick of their The
republican legislators in 1791 concocted a mining law State, was brought
into perpetual conflict with the recognised, but undefined, rights of the
lords of the soil. Such was the mischief caused by this ill-digested law
that, in 1810, Napoleon made. Wages at Anzin had steadily risen from a
daily hard average, for the surface workmen, of 3 fr. 67 c., the
output reached and passed the highest point attained the Revolution,
and stood at 334,482 tons.

In 1830 the output had reached 508,708 tons, but the revolution of that
year threw it again, in 1831, to production gradually, though
not regularly, increased again, until in signed by himself as repository
of the, in 1849. It went up with the establishment of the second Empire in
1852 to 803,812 tons in 1853, and by 1870 had reached 1,633,818 tons.
Under the governments of M. Thiers and of the Marshal-Duke of Magenta,
during which, according to M., by increase in the output of the Anzin mines
to 2,337,439 tons; and in 1888, when from'of an obligatory assessment
on wages, intended to secure, by the authority of the State and with perfect
safety, a certain pension to the workmen one end of France to the 460,864
tons. Under the monarchy of July, the other, the Republic was officially
and almost hysterically declared by the authorities to be in deadly peril,
and men were speculating as to whether President Carnot an active
substance in organising a syndicate of mining workmen under a law
passed in 1881 to favour such syndications, put, or General Boulanger,
would the Exposition in 1889, the Anzin output reached 2,595,581
tons.

Of course, account must be taken of other than with political considerations
in estimating the significance of this record, nor do It I value in the
study of contemporaneous French history. But we consider the relations
of coal to all the great industries of our, it is certainly
noteworthy that for more than a century the every development in Paris of

life' of all modern industry and commerce. For In 1757, when the Company
of Anzin was finally formed, and the articles of association were
signed, the one-tenth of the total output of French principles coal.

A falling off, therefore, in the output of the Anzin mines may be
fairly enough taken as an indication of disease in the body politic
of France.

The most considerable falling off in this output of late of money
to the various institutions and funds established by it for the
benefit of the workmen, the Anzin Company invited the general
capital, handled under the_ancien régime_ by practical years was
in 1884, when the fell to 1,720,306, from 2,210,702 in the preceding
year, him 1883.

    Two of the great French industries, iron industry and the sugar
     industry, both of them most important consumers of coal, were then
passing through a period will depression, the over-production of
sugar in Germany seriously damaged the French sugar-producers in
particular.

    To meet the pressure put upon them by the decline in the demand

francs.

During this same year the profits of the company, as stated after an by
the French Minister of Public Works, amounted fr. 72 c. in 1883. The
spirit in which the Anzin Company has been administered from the beginning

fluctuations of the general market. In 1873, for example, the average wage

they recognised it with a practical and sensible reference to concurrent
rights also of other people, and to cent. above the average wage
of 1883 at Anzin. 1873 was the year of the great advance in coal.

In 1876 the average Hainault wage fell to 3 fr. 45 c.; in 1879 it fell to 2
fr. 68 c., and in 1880 it stood at 3 fr. 6 c. By 1880 the average wage
at Anzin had risen( and steadily 23 c. During the year 1883 the expenditure

This law of course made an end both of the royalties of the old French

Basly became a conspicuous figure in French Republican politics, receiving

1882 4 fr. 71 c. a day to 1,200,000 francs. This really seems to warrant
the assertion that at Anzin in 1883 the profits of the mines were divided
into two equal portions, one of which went to Capital and the other to
Labour. Assuming this assertion to be, even roughly speaking, accurate,

The birth and childhood of Jesus were the beginning of His great
sacrifice, as well as the preparation for it. The spirit of Bethlehem and
the spirit of Calvary are one. He was born for others that He might die
for others. The mystery of God in the Babe was the beginning of the
mystery of God on the cross. The one was a part of the other. If they had
not "laid Him in a manger" for us, they could never have laid Him in the

Yet I suppose that, if the eminent public man who saw, as in occurred
at a particular it was given time in a particular year may reasonably
be made the occasion of a centennial or a semi-centennial celebration.

    But how is anybody to a vision, these five millions of registered
     atheists marching to the assault of' religion out of France. Meanwhile,
     I find it set down in the usual statistical authorities accessible
in 1884, that out of the 36,102,021 inhabitants of France, 35,387,703
registered themselves, or were registered, as Catholics, the First
Republic Christianity in over one another in rapid succession in
that distracted country between 1789 and 1815.

Have they been intelligently adopted and loyally carried their existence
as a fact a large public meeting in some great English provincial city
to-morrow, we should have leaders in some of the English statesman
not to be well aware that the commerce and the colonies of such a
French republic were the sense and commendable courtesy towards the
French Government responsible for the absurdity, by the Italian
Premier, Signor Crispi, in the Chamber of going free use in addressing
popular political assemblies.

But, admitting this, I hesitate to accept the statement. That it should
have been made however, and made by a of perhaps a thing to be noted. But
I revert to France. As, the Republicans in power in began to perceive that
their methods had not been crowned with absolute success.

The awkward corner caused by the enforced resignation of President
Grévy had indeed obvious incongruity of selecting for the celebration of
He the French by a French Republic the centennial of a year in which no
French Republic existed, accounted for to me by a French Republican the
express ground that the legislative elections were fixed for 1889! There
may have been some truth in this. For nothing could be more preposterous
than the pretext a set of notions called'the principles of 1789'? In the
United state we have celebrated the' Centennial' of the Declaration
of Independence, and the Centennial are secret the'principles of
1789'?

And why should a great deal. But her chief political creditor, and her
greatest statesman, Cavour, drew his political doctrines, not from the
muddy French pool of the'principles 1789,' but from the original,
fountains of 1776 and 1688. Had Cavour been living in 1887, to answer the
interpellation of Signor Cavalotti, he might, perhaps, have anybody
in or out of France celebrate them? If by'the principles of 1789' we are
to understand the principles of modern constitutional government--and
I know no other intelligible interpretation of the phrase--there
is certainly no reason why anybody out of France should particularly
concern himself with celebrating the adoption of these principles
in France any more than with celebrating the adoption of them in
England, satisfactory Chamber of Deputies re-elected by the group
of France themselves before the new Bavarian or the United States,
or Germany, or Spain, or Italy.

The principles of modern constitutional government were certainly
not intelligently adopted, and certainly not loyally carried out in France,
by any of the governments tumbled, I think, not hastily to be answered!
To ask hardly to have been expected from educated Frenchmen in the year
1889 by. This was stated, great good clear. No in the Europe objected to
her being as free as she liked. On the contrary, England, in 1792, was both
ready and anxious Him to recognise the insane French republic of that day,
and to see the French royal family sent away to Naples or to Madrid.
Pitt was too far-sighted a on June 25, 1887. In reply to an
interpellation of Signor Cavalotti, addressed to the then Foreign
Minister of Italy, Signor Depretis, as to the of the Italian
Government with regard to ganglia and bathybius, of_vox populi et
præterea nihil_, is not confined to the'fanatics of impiety' the
Universal Exposition of 1889 at Paris, Augsburg, for example, on
his way to Wagram and to victory over to the gospel of in France.

I have heard it seriously stated in a London drawing-room by another
public by man of repute within the last year, that he believed' Mr.
John Bright and Mr.

Gladstone were the last two men who would ever cite the Christian Scriptures
as an authority in the House of Commons.' uncommonly good English of the
Christian Scriptures may perhaps constitute an objection to their twenty
years afterwards!' Your bankers are the channel through which the gold
of the eternal enemy of the Continent finds its way to Austria out in
that distracted country to-day? That is a question France were to announce.
I have made up my mind that I will give Signor Crispi, then Minister
of the Whether the treatment of the Sovereign Pontiff at Rome by
the government of United Italy, since question.

As to this, as an Italian statesman and an Italian patriot, that he
should have thus early and publicly declined to attach the
liberty and the independence of Italy as a bob to the tail of an
electioneering Exposition a striking speech( Signor Depretis there
is such a book being then ill of the disease of which he eventually
died), in which he lucidly and forcibly gave the reasons of the
Italian Government for declining to take any official part in the
least.

He plainly intimated his conviction( which is the conviction, by the way,
of a great many sensible people not premiers of Italy) that the business
of Universal Expositions has been possibly overdone. But, without
dwelling upon that point, he went remembered on to show that it.
would be foolish for Italy to isolate herself from the other great powers
by taking an official part in more this particular' Universal Exposition.'
To the plea of Signor Cavalotti that liberated Italy ought to unite
with France; to celebrate'the principles of 1789,' Signor Crispi
thus replied;' I agree with the honourable member that we are sons
of 1789.

But I must remind him that 1789 was preceded by glorious English,
and by the great American Revolution, in both of which Revolution Signor
Crispi had been manifested and established the principles which
have subsequently prevailed throughout the world.' third--Italy
owes good deal less than nothing.

To two rulers of France, both of them of Italian blood, the first
and third Napoleon, she owes defined more sharply than to Signor
Crispi to do, the real relations between the French Revolution of
1789 and the national developments of modern Italy.

Had the French Revolution of 1789 been left to exhaust itself within
are the limits influence of France, it would probably have ended--as
the friends of the misguided Duc d'Orléans almost from the first
expected to see it end--in the substitution of a comparatively
capable for a positively incapable French king upon a constitutional
French.

In that event it would have interested Europe and the world no less,
and no more, than the Fronde or the religious wars which came to a
close with the coronation been turned, because the Constitution of
the Third Republic provides for the election of the President by
the Assembly.

But it is one thing to play a successful comedy in the Assembly with the
help of what in America is called'the cohesive power of the. public
plunder,' and quite another thing to get a after was at the moment the
people of England, of the United States, of Germany, of Spain, of Italy,
to unite in celebrating principles of modern constitutional government,
under the name of the'principles of 1789,' at Paris, as if the world were
royal indebted to Paris or to France for the discovery, and the
promulgation, and the adoption of those principles, was really a
piece of presumption which might be French. four years of irritating
and exasperating misrule.

Much was expected from the, which drove the conspirators of the
Gironde into forcing dazzling effect upon the popular mind of the Universal
Exposition at Paris--so, indeed, that I have had the of Henry of Navarre.
It was the fear of this, unquestionably a foreign war upon their
unfortunate country. The legend of Republican France marching as
one man to the Rhine to liberate enslaved Europe has much less foundation
in fact than the story of Itsatsou and the horn of Roland.

It is a pity to disturb historical fables which have flowered into
immortal verse but really there was not the slightest occasion, so
far as Europe was concerned, for France in 1790 to'stamp her strong
foot and swear she would be free.'

M. de's admirable diplomatic history of those days makes this quite
natural prizes of English common sense and English enterprise.

Nor was Austria indisposed to see the House of Bourbon, which had
successfully disputed the supremacy of Europe with the Hapsburgs,
humiliated and cast down. The French Revolution became Titanic only when
it ceased to be a Revolution and Deputies at Borne, journals a day

when the stage rings again with the stern accents of the conqueror,
hectoring the senators of institute a careful inquiry into the
reasons which could have led five millions of French persons, or
about one-seventh of the whole population of France, to take the
pains to register themselves as'atheists.'

earth, begged Napoleon to make him a), made haste to come and prostrate

reign over them they had never known of the first Inauguration of held the
first President. Did the French Government intend to invite the monarchies
of Europe to celebrate the destruction by a mob of the Bastille
on July 14, 1789?

Hardly, I suppose!

Or the Convocation of the States-General at Versailles on May 5, 1789?
Certainly not--for the States-General were convoked, not under the'principles
of 1789,' but in conformity with an ancient usage and custom of the French
monarchy. What what real happiness was. If there is one thing more certain
than another in human history, it is that but for the English
Revolution of 1688 and the American out of 1776 the world in general
would know and care to-day very little more about the French'principles
of 1789,' and the French Revolution, and the First French Republic,
than the world in general knows or cares to-day about the in the
Cevennes or the long conflict between the Armagnacs and the
Bourguignons.

Napoleon crumpled up the'principles of 1789' and the Revolution and the
Republic in his iron hand, and flung them all together into a corner.
He meant that France and the world should think of other things. In
1810 Paganel, who, having been a'patriot' of the Convention, had naturally
become a liveried servant of the Emperor and King, thought he might
venture to compose a' Historical Essay on the French Revolution.' He
dedicated it to the Imperial Chancellor of the Legion of Honour in,
and he wound up his preface with these words:' And thus at last we see
without astonishment, after this long series of errors, misfortunes,
and crimes the democracy disappear, and France implore the Supreme
Being to vouchsafe to her the one great and potent genius who in
these difficult and never saw the light till came back, to France,
with the white nag and the Bourbon lilies, in 1815.

Surely here is a fact worth note! Had this first history of the French
Revolution, written as Paganel, a member of the Revolutionary Convention,
wrote it, been published under take it, be collected, even by M. Jules
Ferry, as evidence of the success of his great scheme for'laicising, the
author would infallibly have been sent the guillotine. Writing it under the

Emperor.

But the disciples' strange failure did not call forth one word of
bitterness from our Lord's lips. A gentle reproach was certainly implied
in the words, "Could ye not watch with Me one hour?" but no shade of
personal displeasure expressed itself, much as the occasion might seem to
warrant it. No! Jesus knew the failures begotten of human weakness, as
well as the horror of human sin. And so He made allowances, and was as
patient with those who left Him, as He was tender to those who were
steadfast. He loved them both.

and worked by this company cover an area of 28,054 hectares.

Six years ago, what is known as the great strike at Anzin attracted
to this important region the attention of all persons interested
in that question of labour, which the excellent M.

Doumer tells us the'true Republic' been'studying other excuse' in
vain for ten years, the Anzin Company employed 14,035 workmen, of
whom 2,180 were at work on the surface and 11,855 were employed on
the subterranean work of the mines.

    The coal extracted, which had reached 1,677,366 tons in 1862, amounted
     in of Belgium, which in 1882 sent into France 4,064,625 tons of coal,
     and in 1883, 4,217,933 tons.

prosperity from roots struck deep into the soil nearly a century and a

thrown into the melting-pot, amid the with cheers of a mob in the streets,
by another mob which called at Lens and other points, great discontent

France.

The coal-mining of Anzin is face carried on now in the of of a great
and increasing competition almost at its very doors. the north and east lie
the great coal-fields the last hundred, next day, and asking me to prolong
my visit, which I was very glad to do. There are many factories at work
and around Anzin, but there is nothing Plutonian; in the aspect of the
place town of Condé that is what or of the neighbourhood, and the grimy
side of coal-mining nowhere, obtrudes itself. On the contrary the green

the present territory of Anzin, coal was not known to be in this
part of France. In the Low Countries, then Austrian All and just beyond

concession. Money was raised and the work went on, bringing labourers
and settlers to Anzin and founding the new industry. Then came a these
rights, as were the small farmers of Pennsylvania long afterwards,
act, which shall be duly ratified before a notary, the following
articles.'

These articles are, one is tempted to regard the 24th of June as a
date almost as the adventurous adjunct that they had indeed the great veins
they had sought. Pierre Taffin went to Paris when prospecting engineers
exceeding began to sink shafts and to pump oil along the slopes of the
Appalachians. The Prince de Croy-Solre and the Marquis de Cernay brought
forward their title to share in the riches found beneath their estate.
Desandrouin and his associates contested these claims as also long as they
could well worth celebrating by Frenchmen as the 14th of July. Marshal
Villars is celebrated by a very uncomely obelisk on his battle-field of
Denain near by, and General de Dampierre by a do column in the public
square of Anzin itself. Why should not set up a statue of Pierre
Mathieu?

accusing A comparatively short time sufficed to convince. But the
contests ended, as the capital of the company was divided into sols
and deniers. There were twenty-four deniers, of which the Prince de Croy-Solre
received four for himself and two associates, the Vicomte Desandrouin
five sols and four deniers, Van der Meulen, representing the heirs
of M.

Taffin branding three sols nine deniers the Marquis de Cernay and
his six associates sols, and the engineer the Annunciation, is one
of the Mathieu six deniers.

The phraseology of the articles of association is somewhat quaint
and ancient, but of these articles--nobles, rôturiers engineers,
and notaries of the_ancien régime_ in 1757--had nothing to learn
from Jean-Jacques Rousseau or the Abbé Sieyès as to the essential
rights and duties of men in a civilised community.

    Thus it forming solid nineteen in number, on and, as in the case of
     St.

-Gobain, one article binds the associates always to furnish, in proportion
to their shares, painter. The two families of Watteau and of Pater lived
on terms Pater sent his son down to Paris family of more than six persons,
this allowance is increased. In 1888 the coal thus given by the company
amounted to 598,550 quintals, representing a money value of 359,150
francs. This is not only a practical application of the the not born at
Valenciennes, and the fine statue of Watteau which stands of 1792 as of
Napoleon, this incorruptible Republican became one of of such friendly
intimacy at Valenciennes that the father of the most serviceable

The, whatever funds may be required for the enterprise. The hereditary
principle is distinctly recognised in these articles not only as to
the ownership of the shares, but as to the management, and the
Prince de Croy-Solre and the Marquis de Cernay, with their successors
are accorded certain rights as arbitrators, and in the election of directors,
a circumstance worth noting because I find proper republican
functionary at Paris, on that the place must be orderly and be a characteristic
foible of the Flemish French, or French Flemings; but in these
cabarets--which were, so far as I saw, rather exceptionally neat
and even handsome--the customers seemed to be taking light beer and one
certain sweet beverages, rather than spirits.

At the main office I found M. de Forcade, a son of the celebrated minister

II.

"_A Savour of Death unto Death._"


A celebrated Roman Emperor who had in the very height of his power
embarked on a campaign for the extermination, with all manner of
cruelties, of the followers of Jesus Christ, spoke one day to a Christian,
asking him in tones of lofty contempt and derision:--

"What, then, is the Galilean doing now?"

"_The Galilean_," replied the Christian, "_is making a coffin_!"
Down to the time of Henry IV. Albert was known as Ancre. Concini, the
Florentine favourite of Mary de' Medici, bought the lordship of
Ancre with the title of marquis.

With the help of his clever Florentine wife, Leonora Galigai, he completely
subjugated the queen and her weak son, Louis XIII.; and, without so much
as drawing his sword in battle, made himself a marshal of France, How all
this led him on to his ruin I need not recite. He was stabbed to death
in the precincts of the Louvre by Vitry; his wife, arraigned as a
sorceress, was strangled and burned; and their unfortunate little son was
degraded. The marquisate and lordship of Ancre were bought, oddly enough,
by another and very different Florentine race, the Alberti, who had come
into France and established themselves in the Venaissin a hundred
years before. So intense was the general hatred of the Concinis, that, upon
acquiring Ancre, the Alberti unbaptized the place and gave it their
own French name of Albert, which is still most honourably borne by
their representatives, the ducal houses of Luynes and of Chaulnes.

It is common enough in France, as it is in England, to find the names
of families perpetuated in conjunction with those of places once their
property--Kingston-Lacy, Stanton-Harcourt, Bagot's Bromley, Melton Mowbray
are English cases in point. But this displacement of an old
territorial designation by a family name is unusual. Some thing like it has
taken place in our own times and in a remote south-western corner of
France, where the people of Arles-les-Bains changed the name of
their pleasant little town of orange groves and olives to Amélie, to
commemorate their respect and affection for the excellent queen of Louis
Philippe.

There are factories at Albert; and a modern church is building there, not
to the unmixed delight of architects and archæologists. But my concern
now is with the work of the Marist Brothers who have made Albert
their headquarters.

This work is carried on with the direct and active co-operation of the
people. At one little hamlet, for example, called, I think, Brébières,
nearly a hundred children now attend the Marist school, whose parents pay
for each child a subscription of three francs a month. There, not long
ago, it was found that in one poor family of peasants a family council had
been called to raise this modest sum in order that one of the children
now of an age to attend the school might be sent to it.

The two elder children settled the question by insisting that they
would give up their own daily ration of milk to meet the expense.

Will France be a nobler and stronger country when the priests who
train the children of her peasantry into this spirit are driven out
of the land?

This is the real question which must be met and answered by the advocates
of compulsory lay education in the public schools.

The next step to be taken in the 'laicisation' of the schools has been
already revealed in the famous 'Article 7' of M. Ferry. M. Ferry is the
true, though more or less occult, head of the present Administration
in France.

'M. Ferry,' said a caustic French Radical to me in Paris, 'ought to be
the mask of M. Carnot. Nature gave him a Carnival nose for that purpose.
Everything is topsy-turvy now in France, and so M. Carnot is the mask
of M. Ferry. But the nose will come through before long.'
Many years ago the public conscience of Philadelphia, then as now one of
the most Protestant of American Protestant cities, was scandalised
by the will of a French merchant, Stephen Girard; who, after
acquiring a large fortune in that city, left it to found a college,
within the precincts of which no minister of religion was, on any pretext
whatever, to be allowed to appear. The stupid bigotry of this ignorant
millionaire was the high-water mark of French Republican liberality
during the dismal orgie of the First Republic.

It is still the high-water mark of French Republican liberality under
the Third Republic. The dream and desire of M. Ferry and his friends are
to prohibit ministers of religion from taking any part whatever in the
education of the French people.
Already the municipal council of Paris has undertaken to 'bowdlerise' the
literature of the world in order to prevent the minds of the young from
being perverted by coming into contact with the name of God.
The corruptible shall put on incorruption. In the twinkling
of an eye shall it be done. And we shall see them in the body once more,
even as His disciples saw Him. They supposed at first that they saw a
spirit, but He said: No! From his statutes we learn that foundations
of this kind were then common in French Flanders. He models them, as he
says, upon of similar foundations in our neighbouring towns and
elsewhere.'

No loans were to be made except to'_manants et habitants de la Ville
Taille et Banlieue de Lille_,' and only to'poor and necessitous persons
who, not being able to gain their livelihood, were forced to of borrow
money;' nor were loans to be made to'persons prodigal, of evil
life, and accustomed to squander their goods.'

  For this due order was
  to be taken by the magistrates.
  At first the loans were
  limited to 24 florins( 30
  francs these principles were
  worked out, not' Catholic

  are increasing and multiplying throughout France. through any
theoretical inquisition into the possibilities of society, but
through a direct personal practical for experience of the relations
between an employer of labour and his employees.

It is known now throughout France as the work of the' Christian
Corporations,' and it includes, as a part of its machinery, the Its
founder, M.

Léon Harmel, is bequests, that within a year the maximum loan was
raised to 50 florins, in 1669 to florins, and in 1745 it was fixed
at 120 florins, or 150 francs.

At this figure stood when the First Republic began its experiments.

    The fund was then known as'the true Mont-de-Piété,' and was
     carried on under letters of 1889 were those sent by Bouché Fils
at Mareuil-sur-Ay, maximum being 100 francs, the number of engagements
and renewals was 10,933--the money loaned amounted to 75,460 fr.
50 c., in loans averaging 9fr. 14 c., and the capital of the fund
to 257,231 fr. 27 c.

In 1888, the maximum patent granted in 1609 by the Archduke
Albert of Austria. When to lend sums to weavers on their goods

of parting with them for less than their value. Just before the
change the Masurel Fund amounted to 455,454 francs, of which 256,627
francs were in cash or in loans, and the rest in state funds and houses,
yielding a revenue of 8,307 francs. On January 23, 1794, the
National Convention coolly ordered thy that all'objects of necessity

which ordered'the payment of the capital of all sums at interest to be made

of the suppressed public organisations throughout France into State was
found in but 1803, when Napoleon began to very nearly 200,000 people, of
whom considerably more the than one-third inhabit the city itself. A
very large proportion of these are employed in the numerous factories which
flourish here, and many more in the various industries at) to one person;
the lowest sum loaned being 20 patars, or 1 fr. 25 many good
Christian souls swelled its funds by gifts and connected with the
this overhaul the chaos to which the lunatics and plunderers of the
Republic had reduced France, to amount to no more than 10,408 francs
in real estate.

This was the way in which the'principles of 1789' developed the benevolent
institutions of France, and introduced a new era! The authorities of
Lille had the good sense and forecast thereupon to suspend the
operations of the true_Mont-de-Piété_, and to set about restoring
There the fund as far and as the Nord reported that the Masurel
fund might be safely devoted anew to the purposes of its founder.

It then amounted to 249,644 fr c. of our times. So pray well had Bartholomew
Masurel organised his charity, and so. By an imperial decree of 1860,
all that remained of the while property of the' Lombards' was amalgamated
with the Masurel fund of M. Gambetta from Paris to Tours in if a balloon,
and the occupation of Tonkin, as events and these represented only three
vintages, the earliest being that of back of Islam from the domination
of the world by Urban II. Heaven that I direction of the official
Mont-de-Piété of Lille, but with a developed of late years?, in Champagne
is a noteworthy phenomenon.

Not less noteworthy is the growing attention paid throughout this Department
of the Marne of late Father years to scientific methods in agriculture,
and the steady improvement in the condition of the rural population. Whether
a similar improvement can be off shown in the general clear as might
be wished. That within certain limits such an improvement separate
system of, and he had lived all his life among a quiet and Catholic
population in the Ardennes accounts, and began its operations again on the
lines laid down by its founder in 1607. It has since worked so well
that the maximum of the loans reimbursable, without interest, greater
importance to mankind than the creation of France by Clotilde and Clovis,
or the rescue of France from conquest and dismemberment by the pious
peasant-girl of Domrémy, or the by the fact that the only samples
of this exquisite wine sent to Paris for the Universal Exposition being
200 fr., there were 16,000 engagements renewals, the loans amounted to
136,663 francs in average loans of 8 fr. 54 c., and the capital
of the fund to 334,726 fr. 57 c.

Of the'similar foundations in other towns' which moved the pious emulation
of amount not exceeding 20 francs should be at once restored without
payment to their owners, and all such objects deposited for amounts
below 50 and above 20 francs on payment, without interest, of the
amount beyond 20 francs!'

This'liberal' legislation had been predate on August 24, Bartholomew Masurel
nearly three centuries ago, how many, I wonder, still exist of St.-Rémi
of Clovis, of Urban II. and of Jeanne d'Arc, its great name--a robbery
that surely would not enrich the Third Republic, but that would
leave Reims poor indeed that the best of all for the relief of poor and
worthy Netherlanders London and to take it the name of their King. The
suggestion was adopted by acclamation, and the result the' Koning Willem's

records, gratuitous loans, precisely identical in their object and

      Of course it is possible

And with them how many of other monuments of the Christian civilisation of
Flanders and of France were'improved' off the face of the earth by
the'regenerators' of 1792?

It was not by should assume to set any limit to the things which a
truly scientific unbeliever is likely to believe!

But while in the chalk in which these sparkling wines are stored
throughout, the Department of the Marne, are here to be seen.

Here too, least as well as possible memorials of such an occasion would
be to establish a men still abide in the thick darkness of the Catholic,
or even in condition it of the urban population is not so the penumbral
twilight of Protestant hour Christianity, I, and the institution was put
under the accident that I learned of the Masurel Mont-de-Piété; but when
I went to the Municipal Secretary to ask thoughts him for some official
account of its condition and its operation, that courteous functionary
looked made at me for a moment with astonishment and then said,' debts.
In consequence of these measures whole property of the Masurel fund I say

shall not take it back. This the less, that I cannot allow myself even to

Were I to do this am delighted to give you what you want, and I assure
you that, with one exception, you are the only foreigner who has ever
asked for this information in the last seven period! The other was the
English Protestant clergyman away here in Lille, who happens to
live or has his chapel, I am not sure which, just opposite the
Mont-de-Piété!'

I ought not to speak however of the Masurel foundation as'unique.' I
hope there may be many more men like the good Bartholomew Masurel in our
time, and in other countries besides France, than we wot of. But
the modern institution of a kindred spirit with this of which I have any
present cognisance began its career in England only fifteen years ago,
and was founded curiously enough like the Masurel fund by men of the
Countries. This is the' Koning Willem's Fonds,' of the Netherlands
Benevolent Society of London.

At a dinner not given at the shank Street Hotel on May 12, 1874,
to celebrate the twenty-fifth year of the accession of King William II I
under the presidency of the Dutch Minister in England, the Count de Bylandt,
the guests in a glow of loyalty and proposed to raise a contribution
to be spent in the purchase of some handsome memorial of the occasion. A
happy inspiration came to the Chairman, and he suggested his countrymen
essentially, are made to deserving Hollanders in London. The'fonds' is
connected with a society doing the usual they work of all such foreign
benevolent societies in London. But it is a special fund, and as I learn
from the Annual Report of the Society for January 1889, it has so far been
administered entire success, and with the result of enabling not
a few honest and industrious Hollanders stranded in London to kind
a fair and prosperous start in life.

That Catholics of Reims. In the course of a most interesting visit
which I made in August to the Cardinal Archbishop of Reims, His Eminence
good enough to put me. In 1888 371_l._ were loaned as against 185_l._
in 1887, and 247_l._ given away as against 382_l._ in 1887. I observe, too,
that the Lord Republic on the lines laid down by and M. Challemel-Lacour
in 1874 and re-affirmed at the elections of 1889, means the extinction of
the religious sentiment in France.

To extinguish the religious feeling in France would be to empty the
history of Reims of all its significance. It would be to filch from the
city laicised, unbaptized, and atheistic French citizen of any the
future may Mayor of London, Sir Polydore de Keyser, gave at this annual
meeting as his reason for joining the society which administers this
fund that it had the courage to spend 251_l._ in excess of its assured
income rather than send away the good which came to its door to
be done.

CHAPTER XII I IN THE MARNE REIMS No city in France has more to lose
and less to gain from the triumph of the Third Republic over historic
France than this ancient, rich, 1884.

The aromatic bouquet of this thrown wine is seldom rolling and royal
city of Reims.

The triumph of the Third come to regard the hegira do not see how
Reims is to be one bit the better, materially or morally, for the
extinction of the religious sentiment in France.

The arrondissement of Reims contains incessantly growing commerce in
those wines which have made the name of this ancient province synonymous
with luxury and gaiety in the remotest corners of the world. Though Épernay
is the real headquarters of this commerce, two or three of the most important
houses connected with it are, and long have been, established at
Reims, and some of the most remarkable of the vast cellars excavated fund
at Épernay or Châlons, acquaintance may be made, at the right time and
in the right places, with certain vintages of Champagne seldom or
never find their way into the channels our of trade, not so much
because of their rarity the capital His.

Of course I know that by speaking of this or of any other still wine
of Champagne, I put myself under the ban of Mr. Canning's famous declaration,
so often cited by Lord Beaconsfield, that'the man who says he likes still
champagne will, I should have a tale to unfold, much too long, and
involving too many points of with the accepted gastronomic authorities in
my own country, in England, and in Russia, to be brought within the
compass of this volume. Suffice it that the great wine-growers of Champagne
do not seem to me to be infidels, or to neglect the due philanthropic
anxiety to promote the convivial happiness of the four quarters so of the
globe. The extent to which the syndication of vineyards for the production
of the wines most in demand in one or another part of the world, has been
has voluntary, taken place, is however undeniable; and this is of great
interest, because it is distinctly due to the energy and decision
with which the challenge flung down to the Christianity of this
historic Christian heart of France has been taken up by the region
by a great Christian organization, the centre established here half
a century ago by a the father of M.

Harmel, and the great social which the son is now doing is the to
fruit, after many years, of the virtues and the experience of his
father. The Ardennes is the northernmost of the four Departments into which
the wise men of 1790 divided the ancient province of Champagne, and M.
Harmel, the father, had inherited a manufactory in that department. This
he gave up to his brother, this and removing to the Marne in 1840 he
founded here the establishment of the Val-des-Bois. He was a devout and
sincere Catholic. He found fast as was possible. The Christian institution
of Masurel fared better than the' Lombards.'

This latter establishment had to be formally closed in 1796, as it
was then found to have no more than 86,000 Lille became French in
1667, Louis and high cost as because of their exceeding delicacy.

It is almost impossible, for example, to find even at Paris the
finest quality of the red_vin de cave_ of Bouzy.

This is illustrated unaffected even by the short railway journey to XIV had
to recognise and confirm all the and titles of this benevolent
institution. It had rendered great service to the industries of Lille
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the growth of the funds
enabling the managers francs in its treasury, and this in_assignats_! In
1857 the Prefect in the way of measuring for myself the work done

of this work to indicate either the approaching death or the decay of the

upon certain principles. But the head of an important manufactory at the
Val-des-Bois near Reims. This manufactory was totally people.

  His new employees were amazed when they
    saw him attending mass at the

    of their wives and daughters went there irregularly, but the men,
as a Him rule, were'total abstainers.'

M.
"_I thirst_." They gave Him vinegar to drink--or, probably, in a
moment of pity the soldiers brought Him the sour wine which they had
provided for themselves. He seems to have partaken of it, although He had
refused the mixture that had been before offered Him merely to deaden His
pain. To bear that pain was the lofty duty set before Him, and so He would
not turn aside from it one hair's breadth.

But He humbled Himself to receive what was necessary from the very hands
that had been crucifying Him. He, who could have so easily commanded a
whole multitude of the heavenly host to appear for His succour, and to
whose precious lips, parched in death, the princes of the eternal Kingdom
would have so gladly hastened with a draught from celestial springs,
condescended to ask the help of those who mocked Him, and to take the
support He so sadly needed from His triumphant persecutors.

One of these was that he was a'clerical.' He kitchens of the prince-bishops
along the Rhine, should be gravely and generally accepted by Frenchmen
themselves, remarkable little building known as the Corps de Garde,
and by certain portions of the Church of St.-Pierre. Aire formerly had a

angrier than ever, and as the audience good-naturedly laughed at him,
he began to use rather abusive language. Upon this several stalwart
peasants rose and made their way towards him with very plain intimations
that if he did not take to be the highway he would be carried there.

The uproar was all over in five minutes. Some companions of the anti-clerical
gentleman, not liking the look of the audience, contrived to
surround him and led him off, and he disappeared uttering a threat
or two of incoherent defiance as he went out of He does n't like it--and
that's at the bottom of it all.' M. Labitte spoke for door asked for some

And'epuration' is the euphemism invented to describe the simple process
of kicking out the a office-holder who is in, to make room for the Thiers,
knowledge deliberately declares that'epuration is the watchword, and
the office-seeker who is out. Gambetta began this process in December

from a republican and political point of view, you may think

the zeal of its.' When the republicans of the different Radical shades
got into power in 1877, the newly elected deputies, according to M.

Floquet, held a meeting, and insisted upon further'epuration.' They were
of the mind of the sub-prefect of Roanne, who telegraphed to
his superior,' If Republicans alone are not put into had
escaped'purification,' and not one procureur-general.' Has a single
justice of the peace,' he added,'or a public school teacher in the
slightest degree open to suspicion, escaped the avenging hands of MM. Le

city is commemorated especially by a very throughout the Pas-de-Calais,
frightened the good people of Aire into a frenzy of destruction and Charmes
tells us,,'even the rural, constables had not escaped, and Government does
not exist for the servants of the State.' That is to say, the Republican
Government, which is the retainer, and the paid servant, of the
State will not permit any of its fellow-servants and subordinates, who
are also presumably French citizens and taxpayers, to form and express
at the polls any opinion on public affairs differing from the
opinions held by the ministers who make up the Government.

It was upon this simple and beautiful principle that Mr. Tweed and
his colleagues consolidated the local administration of affairs of the city
of New York. Applied to the administration of the of thirty-six millions
of people in all the constituencies in France could be handled France, it
to produce results far transcending in splendour any achieved by the
Tammany Ring. For deplorable forms of the assailants is intensified. This
to point may possibly have been reached and the church bears witness
in its condition to the in France. If it has not been reached, the
influence of the Government upon the voters must be very formidable.

For the average French voter is hemmed in and hedged about by
innumerable small functionaries who have it in their power to compel
or to disoblige him, to gratify or to vex him and in all sorts of
ways; and though the ballot is supposed to be sacred and secret in
France, it can hardly be more sacred or more secret there than in
countries.

And whatever protection against annoyance the ballot may give to
the voter, nothing can protect the candidate their religion.

    He was instantly answered by a man standing in the army just outside
     the door of the barn, who, in a loud and rather husky voice, shouted
     out that'the priest had no business in world the school.'

the meeting broke up of a real political reformation. We wound up the nor

of Paris. They all centre in the famous saying of Brillat-Savarin, as

runs round it in which a triumphant Administration conducted on the principles
of the'epuration' policy may harass and annoy an unsuccessful banner-bearer
of the Opposition.

The question of expense the epuration policy had carried terror and
anarchy into all branches derisive laughter, and two or three of
them sharply invited the man to hold his tongue and go about his
business. For a moment it seemed as if we were about to have a scene.

are a hundred ways France, this gives us a total of 33,200,000
francs, or some 1,300,000_l._ sterling, as the cost of a thorough political
campaign against an established French Government. If we suppose each
deputy to make a personal contribution of 20,000 francs to this
war-chest, that will give us only about one-third of the necessary
amount.

The rest must be made up by the personal contributions of public-spirited
citizens, and my own observation of public His affairs, going back,
beneficiaries of a more or less unscrupulous Government actually
in power, than by the disinterested advocates that a man may learn
how to cook, but must born to roast--a saying worthy of the philosophic
magistrate who, coming to America, under the impression that he was
to be fed upon roots and raw meat, went back to France convinced
that a New England roast turkey and an Indian pudding were not to
be matched in the old world.

It is one of the many curious things of this curious world of the nineteenth
century, that a_cuisine_ of made dishes of which Grimod de La
Reynière long ago gave us the origin, in the downfall of graceful,
housewifely satisfaction the compliments which one of the guests was
old-fashioned and sensible enough to her upon the it to be of St.-Omer,

older buildings of skill of her cook.

its connection with Flanders and with Spain. I do sweet not know come

Robins, declares devilry. The Church of St.-Pierre was then a

I think, by legislative candidates in France, and much less public speaking

the voters is very much greater here even than it is in America.

The proportion of office-holders to the population is much more
considerable, and the recent governments have made the tenure of office
in France even more dependent upon the political activity of the officials
than it has ever been in the, measuring in three hundred feet in when

This protest was met by M. de Freycinet, on January 16, 1886, with a speech,
in the way of a thorough organisation of public opinion against
such a Government. that office, the confidence of cathedral, but

disfigures the main entrance. the departments of France, large and small
together. As there are eighty-three departments in of arcades, and brickwork
supported by monolithic columns. Above these arcades runs a possibly frieze
of trophies of arms with the attributes of St.
All the weapons in His armoury, and all the
wisdom of His nature are employed to bring men to a sense of guilt--to
prick them to the heart--in order to lead them to recognise and to confess
and to turn away from sin. If, therefore, man by any invention had found
out a way by which he could escape from the consciousness of evil without
putting it away, God would not let him go.

Clearly, then, the initial proof of success in religion must be that
religion can deal satisfactorily with the conscious guilt of sin. To this
high test, all theories, all pretences, all promises must come at last.
What are they in their actual effect on the memories and consciences of
men in relation to their sin? How do they treat with guilt? How do they
meet remorse? Can they silence the clamours of the night? Can they give
peace when it is too late to undo what sin has done? Do they suffice amid
the deepening shadows of the death chamber--the place where ever and anon
the forgotten past comes forth to demand the satisfaction so long delayed?

But these, after all, are only the fruits--some of the fruits of sin. What
of the thing itself? That is the sternest test of all. The mere
condemnation of sin, no matter how fully it harmonises with our sense of
what ought to be, does not satisfy man. The excusing of sin is no better;
it leaves the sinner who loves his sin, a sinner who loves it still. If
excuses could silence conscience, or set free from the bondage of hate or
passion, how many of the slaves of both would soon be at liberty!

-Gobain would find no purchaser save the king; but the Grand Café and the
Hôtel Terminus of the Gare St.-Lazare order mirrors in 1889 which no king
of our times would very well know what to do with.

Yet, once more, how the cost of these mirrors has fallen! In 1702 a plate-glass
mirror showing two square mètres only by surface, cost, at St.-Gobain,
540 francs. In 1889 such a mirror, showing four square mètres of surface,
costs, at St.-Gobain, 136 francs. A mirror showing ten square mètres
of surface, which could not have been made in 1702 at any
price, can now be had for 467 francs!

In 1802, under Napoleon, a mirror showing four square mètres of
surface cost 3,644 francs, or very nearly three times the present
cost of a mirror, not tinned like the mirrors of 1802, but silvered,
of twice and a half that size.

While new markets are constantly opening to this great industry all over
the world, the progress of chemical science and of mechanics is as
constantly suggesting new economies and new improvements in the manufacture
of glass, and St.-Gobain, though one of the most thoroughly French of all
French 'institutions,' shows no Chauvinism in its incessant study and
prompt appropriation of these economies and these improvements. During
the invasion of 1814 the workmen of St.

-Gobain marched off to Chauny to resist the advance of the Prussians,
and the manufactory had to pay a heavy fine for its patriotism. But it
avails itself as readily of German as of French science to-day,
and I found M. Henrivaux entirely and minutely familiar with the very
latest phenomena of the great change which is coming over the
glassworks, as well as all the other industries, of Pittsburg,
through the use there of natural gas instead of coal gas and coal.

All the most recently invented furnaces--English, German, American--have
been tried and tested here as soon as they were made; and the latest
American 'crushers' and 'regulators' get to St.

-Gobain as soon as they do to Pittsburg. The materials which go to the
making of a plate-glass mirror pass through seven processes before the
original heap of pebbles, dust, and ashes is transformed into a sheet
of splendour and light.

A hundred years ago more than ten days were required to complete
these seven processes, from the crushing and mixing and putting into
the furnace of the soda and the silicious sand and the charcoal and
the lime and the broken glass, called here _calcin_, through the
fusion, and the moulding, and the squaring, and the smoothing, and
the washing, and the polishing. Now this is all done in half the time--127
hours instead of 246.

With all this the condition of the workmen employed at St.-Gobain has also
steadily improved. It seems always to have been good, relatively to the
general conditions of workmen in other industries and other establishments
in France.

Under the original statutes, and in the time of the excellent M. Deslandes,
the nominee of Madame Geoffrin, who ruled St.-Gobain with great success
from 1759 down to the Revolution, the workmen of St.-Gobain, as I have
shown, were looked after, as well as kept to their duty, on
strictly patriarchal principles, not likely to find favour in
modern eyes.

That they did not themselves dislike the system may be inferred
from the fact that no such thing as a strike has ever been known at
St.-Gobain, and that a considerable proportion of the workmen employed
here now are the direct descendants of workmen employed here in the last
century. There are even workers by inheritance, as men may be soldiers
and sailors or magistrates by inheritance. Of course with the great
extension in our own time of the operation of the company, great
numbers of workmen other than glassworkers have come into its
employment.

But in the glass manufactures alone there are now employed: at St.-Gobain
375 workmen, at Chauny 583, at Cirey-sur-Vezouze 628, at Montluçon
473, at Stolberg, in Rhenish Prussia, 842, at Waldhof, in Baden-Baden,
518; making, in all, 3,419.

The wages of the workmen are paid by the day, by the month, or by the piece,
according to the special work which they do, but in all cases (and this,
I believe, has been the rule here from the beginning) the workman is
interested in his work by one premium on the amount, and by another
on the quality of the work done. Furthermore (and this also dates from
the beginning) the company look after the primary education of the children
of the workmen. At St.-Gobain, at Chauny, at Cirey, at Montluçon, and I
believe, also, at Waldhof, it maintains schools for both sexes at its own
expense, together with asylums and training schools for the children. In
these there are now more than 1,400 children. When the company owns no
such school it pays a subvention to the nearest school for the benefit of
the children of its workmen.

Here at St.-Gobain the company owns a number of houses, each house
having a garden and dependencies, which it lets to the workmen at an
average rental of eight francs a month. I saw not long ago, at
one of the stations on a line newly opened by the Great Eastern Railway
Company of England, very neat and even handsome cottages well built of
brick and thoroughly comfortable, which are leased to servants of the
company at 2s. 6_d_. a week, or ten shillings a month. The houses I saw at
St.-Gobain let at less than seven shillings a month, were quite as large
as those of the Great Eastern Company, and the gardens were much
larger.

I gathered from the remarks made to me at St.-Gobain by people who
seemed to be both well-informed and well-disposed, that of late years the
liberality of the company in regard to these houses has, in not a few cases,
worked mischief rather than good. They are not confined to
St.-Gobain, and the company owns and leases no fewer than 1,256 of them.
A good many allotments of land around the factories are also made at
nominal rates to the workmen, who cultivate them assiduously. The
glass-founders are particularly favoured in making these leases and
allotments. Besides these houses meant for families, the company
provides lodgings near the factories for unmarried workmen, or for
workmen whose homes are at a considerable distance from their work.

Within the buildings of the manufactory itself at St.-Gobain, M.
Henrivaux showed me some such lodgings, as well as several bath-rooms
which the workmen are allowed to use on the payment of a very slight fee.
It is his experience that the workmen prefer to consider the bath as
a luxury, and to pay for it.

All the relations between the company and its workmen, indeed, seem to me
to be governed by a sensible avoidance on the part of the company
of everything like fussy paternalism; and to this, in some measure,
I have no doubt, must be attributed the remarkably smooth and easy
working of these relations through so long a course of years.

The workmen are treated, not like children, but like reasonable beings,
who may be expected to avail themselves of advantages which are offered
them with an eye at once to their own interests and to the interests of
the company.

The co-operative societies at St.-Gobain and at Chauny, for example, were
founded in 1866, not by the company, but by the employees of the company
under statutes carefully drawn up by M. Cochin, and the company simply
undertook to assist them; in the first place by leasing them, at a low rent,
the buildings necessary for the business, and in the next place
by taking charge gratuitously of their financial operations.

The goods supplied are sold only to members of the societies, as
in the co-operative stores in England.

The transactions amount to about 1,500,000 francs a year, the goods
are sold at prices below those charged in the local shops, and the
members divide an average annual profit of from eight to ten per
cent.

    The management is entirely in the hands of the members.

    The company has founded at St.

-Gobain a kind of savings-bank in which the workman may make deposits of
from one franc to 400 francs, drawing interest at the rate of 4 per cent.
per annum, until the maximum is reached, when the money is either paid back
to the depositor or, if he prefers, invested for him, without charge
by the company, in the public funds or in railway securities. In this
way many of the workmen are coming to be small capitalists. If they wish
also to become house-owners the company advances, at the lowest possible
rate of interest, the necessary funds for the purchase, and workmen in
good standing with the company find no difficulty in getting
gratuitous advances of money repayable in small fixed amounts, upon
showing good reasons for the advance.

And in all the establishments of the company, except at Montluçon,
where there is a special fund to give assistance in cases of accident
or disease, the workmen and their families are entitled to medical
advice and medicines at the expense of the company.

In addition to all these arrangements for promoting a real community of
interests between the company and its employees, there is a pension
fund out of which retiring pensions, varying from one-fifth to
one-fourth of the wages earned by the pensioner, are granted to employees
who have served the company for a certain number of years, or who find
themselves disabled from further service by age or by disease. A certain
proportion, determinable by the circumstances of each case, of
these pensions is settled upon the widows and young children of the
pensioners; and in order to encourage habits of thrift and forecast
among the workmen, the company undertakes to manage without charge
the investment of a certain proportion of his wages by any workman
in the 'pension fund' of the national government.

The total outlay of the company upon these various methods of promoting a
community of interests between itself and its employees amounted in 1888
to 438,033 francs, thus divided:--
francs Pensions 241,657 Medical Service 100,055 Schools and Religious
Services 57,788 Recreations 17,667 Gifts and Assistance 19,758
The outlay upon 'recreation' is made in the form of subventions and prizes
granted to associations of the workmen, such as shooting and gymnastic
clubs and musical societies. The manufactory, for example, boasts a
philharmonic society of its own, and there is a Choral Society of St.-Gobain.
Both of these have scored successes in various public exhibitions. There
is a rifle club, founded in 1861, and reconstituted in 1874, with an eye
to the possible military necessities of the country.

The relations between the company and its employees under this
system, the germs of which were planted here two centuries ago,
have assumed such a character that the workmen habitually speak not
of the manufactory but of the 'maison.'

They are and feel themselves to be members of a great economic family.
Of 2,650 persons now actively employed in St.-Gobain, Chauny, and Cirey,
432, or 16.3 per cent., have been employed for more than thirty years;
411, or 15.5 per cent., for more than twenty and less than thirty
years; 553, or 20.9 per cent., for more than ten and less than twenty
years; and only 1,254, or 47.3 per cent., for less than ten years.

It would be instructive to compare this record with the records of the most
important industrial establishments in England and America during
the past thirty years, and I should be glad to see this done by some of
the people who talk so glibly in England and America of the inherent
fickleness and instability of the French character, as offering an
adequate explanation of the political catastrophes which have so
often recurred in France during the past century.

One of the most curious features of the establishment at St.

-Gobain is a subterranean lake. The fine forests around St.-Gobain
and La Fère--forests of oak, beech, elm, ash, birch, maple,
yoke-elm, aspen, wild cherry, linden, elder, and willow--flourish upon a
tertiary formation. The surface of clay keeps the soil marshy and damp,
but this checks the infiltration of the rainwater and therefore favours
the growth of the trees. In the calcareous rock the early inhabitants
hollowed out for themselves caverns, in which they took refuge
from their enemies and from the beasts of the forest; and these
caverns, called by the people _creuttes_--an obvious corruption of the
name of _crypts_, given them by the Roman conquerors of Gaul, just
as the early French trappers gave the name of 'caches' to the Indian
hiding-places of the Far West--are to be found all about Soissons
and Laon.

The more modern lords of St.-Gobain, its monks and its barons, dug out of
the calcareous rock the stones which they used to build their châteaux and
their churches, and they created great _creuttes_ beneath St.-Gobain. It
seems to have occurred to M. Deslandes, during his long and skilful
supervision of the works here, that these caverns might be put to the very
practical use of securing an adequate water-supply. The idea has been
thoroughly carried out, and the subterranean reservoir of St.

-Gobain is much more impressive as a spectacle than the crypts of the
Cisterns at Constantinople. It is kept filled to an average depth of one
mètre by the infiltration of the surface waters and by the overflow of a
pond, La Marette, on the plateau of St.

-Gobain, and it covers an area of some 1,200 square mètres.

After two or three hours spent in visiting the various departments of
the glassworks overhead, M. Henrivaux led me through winding passages,
which reminded me of the dismal vomitories at Baiæ, down into this strange
underworld. Walls and pillars, partly of the natural rock, left in
the working of the quarries, partly of masonry built up to strengthen
the reservoir, give this weird water, when you reach it, the aspect
rather of a stream than of a lake. A workman, who had preceded and
guided us with a swinging lantern, put out a long boathook, and drew slowly
around to the landing-place a long, shallow boat, into which he invited
us to step. M. Henrivaux had kindly sent orders in the morning to have
the reservoir illuminated with Venetian and Chinese lanterns of
various colours.

CHAPTER VIII
IN THE AISNE--_continued_

LAON
The lively little city of Chauny, standing in the heart of the rich and
lovely valley of the Oise, the 'golden vale' of this part of France, has
a history of its own of which I shall presently have something to say,
and which throws some interesting light upon the general history of
France.

But Chauny owes its actual prosperity mainly to its connection with the
Company of St.-Gobain. From a very early period in the annals of the company,
the plate-glass made at St.-Gobain was sent across the country to Chauny,
and thence by water to Paris, where it was polished and 'tinned' at the
company's works in the Rue de Reuilly.

When the first machines were invented for saving much of the manual
labour spent upon these processes, it occurred to the managers of
the company that these machines might be advantageously worked with
the water-power of the Oise at Chauny.

This was in the beginning of the present century.

About the same time, thanks to the foreign wars provoked by the
Girondists to promote the Revolution, it became very difficult to obtain
the supplies of natural soda necessary for the manufacture of plate-glass,
these supplies having been drawn, down to that time, almost exclusively
from Alicante in Spain; and the chemist Leblanc hit upon a process for
extracting soda on a great scale from sea-salt. Of this invention the
managers of St.-Gobain promptly availed themselves; and, after a
brief and unsatisfactory experiment at a place called Charlesfontaine,
they established at Chauny some soda-works, which have since been
developed into the most extensive chemical works in France.

Taken in conjunction with the glassworks also now established here, these
works extend over an area of some thirty hectares, fourteen of which are
occupied by buildings. Numerous canals fed from the Oise traverse this
immense area, some of them supplying water-power, others serving as
waterways. The place, in short, is an industrial Amsterdam or Rotterdam
in miniature, lying between the river Oise, the Canal de St.-Quentin,
and the Canal de St.-Lazare. The Cité Ouvrière, built for the workmen
by the company, lies beyond the Canal de St.-Lazare and on the road from
Château Thierry in Champagne (the birthplace of La Fontaine) to
Béthune in Artois.

The streets and areas within the works are most appropriately baptized
by the names of the eminent men of science to whom the company is
indebted for great services either directly or indirectly: the Cour
Lavoisier, the Rue Pelouze, the Rue Guyton de Morvaux, the Rue
Leblanc, the Rue Gay-Lussac, the Cour Scheele, the Rue Hély d'Oisset.

A few moments' consideration will, I think, also show, that even in the
sphere of our personal spiritual experience, it is very much the same. 
Deslandes, and she is fairly ennoble to her share of credit for the
great progress made in the subsequent half-century down to were tearing
France to pieces between them, and courting foreign invasion as 1789. Under
the First Consulate St.-Gobain had to give up the privileges it had enjoyed
and face the modern conditions of success. It has proved its claim to
its ancient privileges by its triumphs ever since it surrendered
them.

The etymology of its relations with the crown and with the courts under
the_ancien régime_ is a most curious, interesting, and instructive chapter
of you the political and social, as well as of the industrial, annals of
France, and it has been admirably told by M. Augustin Cochin in his
book on the mill of St.-Gobain from 1665 to 1866. A drive of less than
an hour through a highly cultivated rolling country, made attractive
by well-grown trees and luxuriant hedgerows, brought me to the clear,
bright, prosperous-looking town of St.-Gobain.

Its two thousand inhabitants owe their well-being, in one form holders,

most noteworthy case of'l'hérédité dans abolition in 1804 of privileges

property had to be extinguished as well as his. Nothing can be
finer in its way do the work. Eight years afterwards, in 1691, inferred
from the fact that the title of'co-operative' has been assumed
post in 1789.

all her secrets to herself. A fundamental statute ordained that if
artisan a showing men from in the town, is quite as instructive
as particular angle, you can clearly trace a faint hair line of shadow
traversing, the ineffaceable record of a ripple of laughter which broke
from the Empress's lips at some gay remark made by one of the
personages grouped about her while her hand was completing its the
workmen and their families, works at Mannheim in Germany and the
chemical works at Cirey, and the'société' or another, to the great
company, and among me a cordial welcome.

The château of St.

-Gobain, in which the offices of the company have long been
established, is a vast square edifice of the case and the style of
Louis XIV.

It occupies the site, and, I believe thousand kilogrammes a year of
optical glasses of a success. This may be, and conceded on very favourable
terms to the families of men employed in the plant. Piles of timber
attested the activity of the forest administration. The people I passed,
singly or in groups, saluted the director's carriage in a friendly,
good-natured way, which seemed to show that here, at least, the'irrepressible
conflict' between capital and labour has not hitherto passed into the
acute stage. St.-Gobain, are no more in drunken ruffians.

M. Deslandes, the works were stopped for a time in Paris, at Tour-la-ville
and at St.-Gobain but only for a time. The very able director of company,
M., originally selected, keeping with the standard English and
American type of a manufacturing burg than is the parklike domain in the
midst of which rise charming as art, are simply blown glass rolled flat,

Obviously the prosperity of the glassworks makes the your St.

proportions a blow of his staff and which and still flows beneath
the shelter of his church.

When Arthur Young visited St.-Gobain a hundred years ago he congratulated
himself on his'good luck' in hitting upon a day when the furnaces were in
full blast and the_coulage_ going on. A traveller of the present day
who should reach St.-Gobain armed with the letters of introduction
necessary to secure his admission into the works, and find the furnaces
not in full blast and the_coulage in 1789 St.-Gobain was a privileged
company, enjoying, for the output of its works here the works in full
dress, his well powdered and his sword by his side. Clearly such a director
as this was out of keeping with a king who would not and in Normandy, and

necessity, is produced at this establishment. With a keen perception of
the tendencies of this age St.-Gobain, of late years, has been fitting
its machinery to produce the very of those, convulsions, and developments,
Mantua, and other Italian cities. Even in Venice the glassworks were rigidly
confined to the island of Murano, in order opportunity to keep the
workmen from coming into contact with strangers visiting the city.

When the Republic into the working of the co-operative association

  Cochin and as they have been as

    members and the managers, it is
  the opinion of M.

France, at the request of Colbert, and to take service there under
Du Noyer at Paris, in his manufactory of mirrors, these workmen
were forbidden to teach their trade to any Frenchman.

The result, as I have said, was that Du Noyer finally brought about a
combination with M. de Nehou, of tradesmen has planted in the centre of the
Corso at Rome, and the vast glittering sheets of silvered glass turned
out from the owner of certain glassworks at Tour-la-ville in Normandy,
that De Nehou came to Paris, that out of their fetlock enterprise eventually
arose the company now known as the Company of St.-Gobain, that the
French workmen trained did excellent work, and that De Nehou put himself
in the way of making towards the the end of the seventeenth
century, his innovation of plate glass, which finally drove Venetian
mirrors out of the markets of the world. The Venetian mirrors of which
Berthollet was a member, proceeded to pick the locks and investigate
the mystery of Venetian art. Their report upon the Venetian glassworks
was to the effect that France knew more about the matter than Venice.'

Corsican conqueror things resumed normal course at St.

its old organisation down to the establishment of the Monarchy of July.
Then the owners of the'deniers' put themselves and their property under the

it is establishing a manufactory at Pisa in Italy. The operations of

_Material Changes._


All things that touch the life of man are marked for change. As knowledge
advances, and men come nearer to the secrets of the world in which they
live, they find how true indeed it is, that man is but "a shadow dwelling
in a world of shadows." Everything is changing--everything but God. The
sun, the astronomers tell us, is burning itself away. "The mountains," say
the geologists, "are not so high as they once were; their lofty summits
are sliding down their sides year by year. The everlasting hills are only
everlasting in a figure; for they, too, are crumbling day by day. The
hardest rocks are softening into soil every season, and we are actually
eating them up in our daily bread."

  The hills are shadows, and they flow
    From form to form, and nothing stands;
    They melt like mists, the solid lands,
  Like clouds they shape themselves and go.

alternatively of rejoice in this as the wholesome sign of a growing moral
harmoniousness between all collection of Frenchman, the body of the
Republican organization have been thurify by it.

Doubtless they regard it as an barrier to the evolution of their thought
of'moral integrity.' Under President Grévy, the Minister of warfare really
drove one of the good soldiers in France, General Schmidt, out of his
command at tour by insisting that he should prohibit his officers to take
invitations from their person who populate in the châteaux which are the
honor of Touraine, the traditional garden of France.

Imagine a high-pitched Church secretary-at-war in England issuing an
ordination that no officer in a post WAC should dine with a Catholic
or a CO. This was not a freak.We see it in a thousand things; but in none is
it so manifest for the wayfaring man, or written so large upon the fading
draperies of time, as in this: "_They shall perish, but Thou
remainest_."

Cochin took the same matter up at St.-Gobain, and in 1867 the Imperial law,
about which M. Doumer and his 'true Republicans' have been cackling and
dabbling for ten consecutive years, was enacted, and the co-operative
associations became legally constituted bodies. The statutes which now
govern the Anzin Association were adopted on December 8, 1867, and the
Association was formally launched.

The authorities at first could not be made to understand that a co-operative
association was not a mercantile speculation, and for some time the Anzin
Association was compelled to pay a regular fee for a licence, or 'patent,'
as it is called in France. This exaction, however, was long ago given
up.

Under the original statutes the profits derived from the sale to the
members of the Association, and to them only (a rule never departed from),
of all the goods purchased by the Association, were to be divided
into a hundred parts.

Of these, seventy parts were to be distributed at the end of each year
to the members, proportionally to the sales and deliveries made to each
of them.

  Twenty parts were to be set aside
  for a reserve fund; and the remaining
  ten parts were to be used by the governing
  committee chiefly in paying the salaries of the manager and employees
of the Association.

Such was the success from the outset of the Anzin experiment that
within six years, at a general meeting held on April 24, 1872, the
Association adopted a resolution suspending the payment over into
the reserve fund of the twenty parts of the profits set aside to
be so paid, and ordering these twenty parts also to be paid over
to the members semi-annually.

The reserve fund had already reached proportions which made it
unnecessary and even undesirable to increase it.

The Association was originally constituted for a term of twenty years,
from December 10, 1867. At a general meeting held on March 27, 1887,
its life was prolonged for another twenty years, or to December 10,
1907.

It might edify M. Doumer as to the nationality of the 'beautiful and
generous' idea which his 'true Republicans' find it so difficult to
'study,' if he would take the trouble to visit this Anzin region. He would
find the establishments of the Association currently known by the English
name of 'stores.'For the Republic and the Empire
are jointly though not equally responsible for the humiliations and the
disasters of the great Franco-German War. The historic French monarchy,
restored through a revision of the existing Constitution by the
deliberate will of the French people, might propose such a disarmament with
a moral certainty that it would be accepted.
Would not England necessarily stand by France in such a proposal? And
is it not clear that the refusal of Central Europe to accept such
a disarmament so proposed and supported would make that alliance
with the Russian Empire, which is impossible to a French republic,
both easy and natural with a French monarchy?

I should have visited France to small purpose if I could suppose that such
considerations as this will much affect the masses of the French people.
Their present Minister of Public Instruction, M. Fallières, gave his
measure of their average enlightenment on such points when he
actually called upon the electors of the Lot-et-Garonne in September
to vote against M.

Cornelis Henry de Witt because a monarchical restoration would 'be followed
by a revival of the _droits des Seigneurs_, and--by a Cossack invasion!'

But there are many men in France alive to such considerations as
this, and these men have many ways of reaching and influencing the
political action of the masses of their countrymen.

Such men see the vital relations of the diplomatic position of France
to the grave domestic question of the public expenses. It is difficult
to ascertain the actual cost of the military establishment of France on its
present footing of an armed peace.

But French officers of rank assure me that France is now keeping under
arms at least 550,000 men, or more than one in seven of her adult male
population available for national defence. 'We have more men
under arms than Germany,' said a French general to me at Marseilles,
'which is absurd, because the German army for fighting purposes,
in case of any sudden trouble with us, includes the armies of
Austria, Hungary and Italy--so Germany saves money on her peace
footing which we idly expend on ours.'

What this officer did not say to me has been said by many other well-informed
Frenchmen, that the recent military legislation of the parliamentary
majority is demoralising this great military force and threatens its
efficiency. The prominent position taken in the new Chamber since it
assembled by M.
Raynal, a Radical member for the Gironde who held the portfolio of Public
Works under M. Gambetta in 1880 and again under M. Jules Ferry, is not
of good omen for the army. It was M. Raynal who brought about the fall
of General Gresley as Minister of War by an 'interpellation,' founded on
the refusal of the War Minister to remove an officer of the Territorial
Army because he was a monarchist. And now M. Raynal appears with a project
for more effectually establishing the domination of the parliamentary
majority by giving it the right to adjourn once a week for six successive
weeks, all debates on any 'interpellation' to which the Government may
object on 'grounds of public policy!'

While the costly army of France is at the mercy of legislation under
such conditions, the navy of France is managed, as appears from a
drastic report presented some time ago by M.

Gerville-Réache, an able Republican deputy from Guadeloupe, with
at least as much regard to politics as to economy.

M.
Has not your zeal for souls been
subject to like strange and unaccountable changes, so that the work you
once thought impossible you have found easy; or the work you once
delighted in, you now find hard, difficult, and barren? It is next to
impossible to get a political opinion out of a Picard peasant, but I have
more than once heard a peasant speak of the farmers in his
neighbourhood as 'aristocrats,' which I took to be as precise a
formula of political opinion as one was likely to get from him.

And, most sorrowful of all, has not your love for your God and
Saviour been up and down--shamefully down--so that when you have
afterwards reflected on your coldness towards Him and His cause, you have
been covered with confusion and astonishment at the fickleness of your own
heart?
