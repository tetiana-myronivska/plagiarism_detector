THE HOYDEN.


CHAPTER I.

HOW DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND, AND HOW THE SPARKS FLEW.


The windows are all wide open, and through them the warm, lazy
summer wind is stealing languidly. The perfume of the seringas from
the shrubbery beyond, mingled with all the lesser but more delicate
delights of the garden beneath, comes with the wind, and fills the
drawing-room of The Place with a vague, almost drowsy sense of
sweetness.

Mrs. Bethune, with a face that smiles always, though now her very
soul is in revolt, leans back against the cushions of her lounging
chair, her fine red hair making a rich contrast with the pale-blue
satin behind it.

"You think he will marry her, then?"

"Think, think!" says Lady Rylton pettishly. "I can't afford to
_think_ about it. I tell you he _must_ marry her. It has come to the
very last ebb with us now, and unless Maurice consents to this
arrangement----"

She spreads her beautiful little hands abroad, as if in eloquent
description of an end to her sentence.

Mrs. Bethune bursts out laughing. She can always laugh at pleasure.

"It sounds like the old Bible story," says she; "you have an only
son, and you must sacrifice him!"

"Don't study to be absurd!" says Lady Rylton, with a click of her
fan that always means mischief.

She throws herself back in her chair, and a tiny frown settles upon
her brow. She is such a small creation of Nature's that only a frown
of the slightest dimensions _could_ settle itself comfortably
between her eyes. Still, as a frown, it is worth a good deal! It has
cowed a good many people in its day, and had, indeed, helped to make
her a widow at an early age. Very few people stood up against Lady
Rylton's tempers, and those who did never came off quite unscathed.

"Absurd! Have I been absurd?" asks Mrs. Bethune. "My dear
Tessie"--she is Lady Rylton's niece, but Lady Rylton objects to
being called aunt--"such a sin has seldom been laid to my charge."

"Well, _I_ lay it," says Lady Rylton with some emphasis.

She leans back in her chair, and, once again unfurling the huge
black fan she carries, waves it to and fro.

Marian Bethune leans back in her chair too, and regards her aunt
with a gaze that never wavers. The two poses are in their way
perfect, but it must be confessed that the palm goes to the younger
woman.

It might well have been otherwise, as Lady Rylton is still, even at
forty-six, a very graceful woman. Small--very small--a sort of
pocket Venus as it were, but so carefully preserved that at
forty-six she might easily be called thirty-five. If it were not for
her one child, the present Sir Maurice Rylton, this fallacy might
have been carried through. But, unfortunately, Sir Maurice is now
twenty-eight by the church register. Lady Rylton hates church
registers; they tell so much; and truth is always so rude!

She is very fair. Her blue eyes have still retained their azure
tint--a strange thing at her age. Her little hands and feet are as
tiny now as when years ago they called all London town to look at
them on her presentation to her Majesty. She has indeed a charming
face, a slight figure, and a temper that would shame the devil.

It isn't a quick temper--one can forgive that. It is a temper that
remembers--remembers always, and that in a mild, ladylike sort of
way destroys the one it fastens upon. Yet she is a dainty creature;
fragile, fair, and pretty, even now. It is generally in these
dainty, pretty, soulless creatures that the bitterest venom of all
is to be found.

Her companion is different. Marian Bethune is a tall woman, with a
face not perhaps strictly handsome, but yet full of a beautiful
_diablerie_ that raises it above mere comeliness. Her hair is red--a
rich red--magnificent red hair that coils itself round her shapely
head, and adds another lustre to the exquisite purity of her skin.

8. The future of telephone working, especially in large cities,
is one of underground wires, and the way to get over the difficulties
of this kind of work is perfectly clear. We must have metallic
circuits, twisted wires, low resistance, and low capacity. In
Paris a remarkable cable, made by Fortin-Herman, gives an exceedingly
low capacity--viz., only 0.069 [phi] per mile.

In the United States they are using a wire insulated with paper
which gives 0.08 [phi] per mile. We are using in London Fowler-Waring
cable giving a capacity of 1.8 [phi] per mile, the capacity of
gutta-covered wire being 3 [phi] per mile.

THE MANUFACTURE OF PHOSPHORUS BY ELECTRICITY.

One of the most interesting of the modern applications of electricity
to the manufacture of chemicals is to be found in the recently
perfected process known as the Readman-Parker process, after the
inventors Dr.

J.B. Readman, F.R.S.E., etc., of Edinburgh, and Mr.

Thomas Parker; the well known practical electrician, of Wolverhampton.

Before giving an account of this process, which has advanced
beyond the experimental to the industrial stage, it may
be well to recall the fact that for several years past Dr.

Readman has been devoting an enormous expenditure of labor, time
and money to the perfection of a process which shall cheapen the
production of phosphorus by dispensing altogether with the use of
sulphuric acid for decomposing the phosphate of lime which forms
the raw material of the phosphorus manufacturer, and also with the
employment of fire clay retorts for distilling the desiccated mixture
of phosphoric acid and carbon which usually forms the second stage
of the operation.

The success of the recent applications of electricity in the
production of certain metals and alloys led Dr.

Readman to try this source of energy in the manufacture of
phosphorus, and the results of the first series of experiments
were so encouraging that he took out provisional protection on
October 18, 1888, for preparing this valuable substance by its
means.

The experiments were carried on at this time on a very small scale,
the power at disposal being very limited in amount.

Yet the elements of success appeared to be so great, and the
decomposition of the raw material was so complete, that the process
was very soon prosecuted on the large scale.

After a good deal of negotiation with several firms that were
in a position to supply the electric energy required, Dr.

Readman finally made arrangements with the directors of the
Cowles Company, limited, of Milton, near Stoke-on-Trent, the
well known manufacturers of alloys of aluminum, for a lease of a
portion of their works and for the use of the entire electrical
energy they produced for certain portions of the day.

The experiments on the large scale had not advanced very far before
Dr. Readman became aware that another application for letters patent
for producing phosphorus had been made by Mr. Thomas Parker, of
Wolverhampton, and his chemist, Mr. A.E. Robinson. Their joint patent
is dated December 5, 1888, and was thus applied for only seven weeks
after Dr. Readman's application had been lodged.

It appeared that Mr.

Parker had conducted a number of experiments simultaneously but
quite independently of those carried on by Dr.
Readman, and that he was quite unaware--as the latter was unaware--of
any other worker in this field.

It was no small surprise, therefore, to find during an interview
which took place between these rival inventors some time after the
date referred to, that the two patents were on practically the same
lines, namely, the production of phosphorus by electricity.

Their interests lay so much together that, after some delay, they
arranged to jointly work out the process, and the result has been
the formation of a preliminary company and the erection
on a large scale of experimental plant in the neighborhood of
Wolverhampton to prove the commercial success of the
new system of manufacturing phosphorus.

Before describing these experimental works it may be as well to see
with what plant Dr.

Readman has been working at the Cowles Company's works.

And here we may remark that we are indebted to a paper read by Dr.
Readman at the Philosophical Institution, Edinburgh, a short time
ago; this paper being the third of a series which during the last
year or two have been read by the same scientist on this branch of
chemical industry.

Here is an abstract giving a description of the plant.

The works are near the Milton Station, on the North Staffordshire
Railway.
The boilers for generating the steam required are of the Babcock-Wilcox
type, and are provided with "mechanical stokers;" the steam engine
is of 600 horse power, and is a compound condensing horizontal
tandem, made by Messrs.

Pollitt & Wigzel, of Sowerby Bridge. The fly wheel of this engine
is 20 feet in diameter, and weighs 30 tons, and is geared to the
pulley of the dynamo, so that the latter makes five revolutions
for each revolution of the engine by rope driving gear, consisting
of eighteen ropes.

The engine is an extremely fine specimen of a modern steam engine;
it works so silently that a visitor standing with his back to the
engine railings, at the time the engine is being started, cannot
tell whether it is in motion or not.

With regard to the dynamo, the spindle is of steel, 18 feet long,
with three bearings, one being placed on either side of the driving
pulley.
The diameter is 7 inches in the bearings and 10 inches in the part
within the core.

This part in the original forgings was 14 inches in diameter, and
was planed longitudinally, so as to leave four projecting ribs or
radial bars on which the core disks are driven, each disk having
four key ways corresponding to these ribs.

There are about 900 of these disks, the external diameter being 20
inches and the total length of the core 36 inches.

The armature winding consists of 128 copper bars, each 7/8 in. deep,
measured radially, by 3/8 in. wide.

These bars are coupled up so as to form thirty-two conductors only;
this arrangement has been adopted to avoid the heating from the
Foucault currents, which, with 1½ in.
conductors, would have been very considerable. The bars are coupled
at the ends of the core across a certain chord and are insulated.

The commutator is 20 inches long, and has sixty-four parts.

The current is collected by eight brushes mounted on a separate ring,
placed concentric to the commutator; and the current is led away
from these brushes by a large number of thin bands of sheet copper
strapped together into convenient groups. The field magnets are of
the horizontal double type.

As this machine is virtually a series wound machine, the magnet coils
each consist of a few turns only of forged copper bars, 1½ in.
wide by 1 in. thick, forged to fit the magnet cores.

There is no insulation other than mica wedges to keep the bars
from touching the core.

The dynamo furnishes a current of about 5,000 amperes, with an E.M.F.

of 50 to 60 volts, and three years ago was claimed to be the largest
machine, at least as regards quantity of current, in the world.

The current from the dynamos is led by copper bars to an
enormous "cut out," calculated to fuse at 8,000 amperes. This
is probably one of the largest ever designed, and consists of a
framework carrying twelve lead plates, each 3½ in. × 1/16th in.
thick. A current indicator is inserted in the circuit consisting of
a solenoid of nine turns. The range of this indicator is such that
the center circle of 360°=8,000 amperes.

The electrodes consisted of a bundle of nine carbons, each 2½ in.
in diameter, attached by casting into a head of cast iron.

Each carbon weighs 20 lb, and, when new, is about 48 inches long.

The head of the electrode is screwed to the copper rods or "leads,"
which can be readily connected with the flexible cable supplying
the current.

The electric furnaces are rectangular troughs built of fire brick,
their internal dimensions being 60 in. × 20 in. × 36 in. deep. Into
each end is built a cast iron tube, through which the carbon electrodes
enter the furnace.

The electrodes are so arranged that it is possible by means of
screwing to advance or withdraw them from the furnace.

The whole current generated by the great dynamo of the Cowles Company
was passed through the furnace.

In the experiments raw materials only were used, for it was evident
that it was only by the direct production of phosphorus from the
native minerals which contain it, such as the phosphates of lime,
magnesia, or alumina that there was any hope of superseding, in
point of economy, the existing process of manufacture.

In the furnaces as used at Milton much difficulty was experienced
in distributing the heat over a sufficiently wide area. So locally
intense indeed was the heat within a certain zone, that all the
oxygen contained in the mixture was expelled and alloys of iron,
aluminum, and calcium combined with more or less silicon, and
phosphorus were produced.

Some of these were of an extremely interesting nature.

We now turn to a short account of the works and plant which have
been erected near Wolverhampton to prove the commercial success of
the new system of manufacturing phosphorus.

The ground is situated on the banks of a canal and extends to about
10 acres, which are wholly without buildings except those which
have been erected for the purposes of these industrial experiments.

These consist of boiler and engine houses, and large furnace sheds.

There are three Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers of 160 horse power
each, and each capable of evaporating 5,000 lb. of water per hour.

The water tubes are 18 ft. long × 4 inches diameter, and the
steam and water drums 43 in. in diameter and 23½ ft. long, of steel
7/16 ths.

in. thick, provided with a double dead head safety valve, stop
valves, blow-off cock, water gauges, and steam gauge.

The total heating surface on each boiler is 1,619 square feet and
the total grate surface is 30 square feet.

The boilers are worked at 160 lb. pressure.

The engine is a triple compound one of the type supplied for torpedo
boats, and built by the Yarrow Shipbuilding Company. It is fitted
with a Pickering governor for constant speed.

The engine is capable of delivering (with condenser) 1,200 indicated
horse power, and without condenser 250 indicated horse power less.

With steam at 170 lb. pressure the engine worked at 350 revolutions
per minute, but it has been rearranged so as to deliver 700
indicated horse power with 160 lb. steam pressure without condenser,
and at 300 revolutions per minute:

The high pressure cylinder is 14½ inches diameter.
" intermediate " " 25 " " " low pressure " " 32 " " " stroke is
16 inches.

The dynamo for producing the requisite amount of electric
current supplied to the furnaces is one of the well known Elwell-Parker
type of alternating current dynamos, designed to give 400 units of
electrical energy, equivalent to 536 indicated horse power.

The armature in the machine is stationary, with double
insulation between the armature coils and the core, and also between
the core and the frame, and is so arranged that its two halves may
be readily connected in series or in parallel in accordance with
the requirements of the furnaces, e.g., at an electromotive force
of 80 volts it will give 5,000 amperes, and at 160 volts, 2,500
amperes when running at 300 revolutions per minute.

The exciting current of the alternator is produced by an Elwell-Parker
shunt wound machine, driven direct from a pulley on the alternator
shaft, and so arranged as to give 90 amperes at 250 volts when
running at a speed of 800 revolutions per minute.

From 60 to 70 amperes are utilized in the alternator, the remainder
being available for lighting purposes (which is done through
accumulators) and general experimental purposes.

The process is carried out in the following way: The raw materials,
all intimately and carefully mixed together, are introduced into
the furnace and the current is then turned on.

Shortly afterward, indications of phosphorus make their appearance.

The vapors and gases from the furnace pass away to large copper
condensers--the first of which contains hot and the second cold
water--and finally pass away into the air.

As the phosphorus forms, it distills off from the mixture, and
the residue forms a liquid slag at the bottom of the furnace. Fresh
phosphorus yielding material is then introduced at the top.
In this way the operation is a continuous one, and may be continued
for days without intermission.

The charges for the furnace are made up with raw material, i.e.,
native phosphates without any previous chemical treatment, and the
only manufactured material necessary--if such it may be called--is
the carbon to effect the reduction of the ores.

The crude phosphorus obtained in the condensers is tolerably pure, and
is readily refined in the usual way.

Dr. Readman and Mr. Parker have found that it is more advantageous
to use a series of furnaces instead of sending the entire current
through one furnace. These furnaces will each yield about 1½ cwt.
of phosphorus per day.

Analyses of the slag show that the decomposition of the raw phosphates
is very perfect, for the percentage of phosphorus left in the slag
seldom exceeds 1 per cent.--_Chemical Trade Journal_.

NEW BLEACHING APPARATUS.

The apparatus forming the subject of this invention was designed
by Francis A. Cloudman, Erwin B. Newcomb, and Frank H. Cloudman,
of Cumberland Mills, Me., and comprises a series of tanks or chests,
two or more in number, through which the material to be bleached
is caused to pass, being transferred from one to the next of the
series in order, while the bleaching agent is caused to pass through
the series of chests in the reverse order, and thus acts first and
at full strength upon the materials which have previously passed
through all but the last one of the series of chests and have already
been subjected to the bleaching agent of less strength.

For convenience, the chest in which the material is first introduced
will be called the "first of the series" and the rest
numbered in the order in which the material is passed from one to
the other, and it will be understood that any desired number may
be used, two, however, being sufficient to carry on the process.

The invention is shown embodied in an apparatus properly constructed
for treating pulp used for the manufacture of paper, and for
convenience the material to be bleached will be hereinafter referred
to as the pulp, although it is obvious that similar apparatus might
be used for bleaching other materials, although the apparatus might
have to be modified to adapt it for conveying other materials of
different nature than pulp from one bleaching chest to the other
and for separating out the bleaching liquid and conveying it from
one chest to the other in the reverse order to that in which the
material passes from one chest to the next.

The pulp material with which the apparatus herein illustrated is
intended to be used is retained in suspension in the bleaching
liquid and flows readily through ducts or passages provided for it
in the apparatus in which the pulp to be bleached and the bleaching
liquid are introduced together at the bottom of each chest and flow
upward therethrough, while at the top of each chest there are two
conveyors, one for carrying the pulp from one chest to the next in
order, while the other carries the bleaching liquid from one tank
to the next in the reverse order, the said conveyors also acting
to partially separate the pulp from the liquid in which it has been
suspended during its upward passage through the chest.

Suitable agitators may be employed for thoroughly mixing the materials
in the chest and in the apparatus shown the bleaching agent and
material to be bleached pass through each chest in the same
direction--namely from the bottom to the top--although they are
carried from one chest to the next in the reverse order, the material
to be bleached being primarily introduced into the chest at one end
of the series, while the bleaching agent or solution is introduced
primarily into the chest at the other end of the series.

Fig. 1 is a plan view of an apparatus for bleaching in accordance
with this invention, comprising a series of four chests, and Fig. 2
is a vertical longitudinal section of a modified arrangement of two
chests in line with one another, and with the conveyor for the
material to be bleached and the passage through which said material
passes from the top of one chest into the bottom of the next chest
in the plane of section.

[Illustration: Fig. 1]
The chests, _a_ _a2_ _a3_ _a4_, may be of any desired shape and
dimensions and any desired number may be used. Each of said chests
is provided with an inlet passage, _b_, opening into the same
near its bottom, and through this passage the materials are
introduced.

The unbleached material, which may be paper pulp or material which
is readily held in suspension in a liquid and is capable of flowing
or being conveyed from one point to another in a semi-fluid
condition, is introduced through the inlet passage, _b_, to the
first chest, _a_, of the series, said pulp preferably having had
as much as possible of the liquid in which it was previously suspended
removed without, however, drying it, and, together with the said
pulp, the bleaching agent which has previously passed through the
other chests of the series, as will be hereinafter described, is
introduced so that both enter together at the lower portion of the
first chest, _a_, of the series.

The said materials are caused to flow into the chest continuously,
so that the portion at each moment entering tends to displace that
which has already entered, thus causing the materials to rise
gradually or flow upward from the bottom to the top of the chest.

Suitable stirring devices or agitators, _c_, may be employed to
keep the pulp in suspension and to expose it thoroughly and uniformly
to the liquid introduced with it.

[Illustration: Fig. 2]
When the materials (the pulp and the bleaching liquid) arrive at
or near the top of the chest, they are partially separated from one
another and removed from the chest at substantially the same rate
that they are introduced, as follows: Each chest is provided at its
upper part with a liquid conveyor, _d_, having a construction similar
to that of the device known as a "washer" in paper making machinery,
consisting of a rotating drum, the periphery of which is covered
with gauze, which permits the liquid to pass into it, but excludes
the pulp suspended in the liquid, the said drum containing blades
or buckets that raise the liquid which thus enters through the gauze
and discharges it at _d2_ near the axis of said drum.

There is one of these washers in each one of the series of chests,
and each discharges the liquid taken from its corresponding chest
into the inlet pipe of the next preceding chest of the series, the
washer in the chest, _a4_, for example, delivering into the inlet
passage, _b_, of the chest, _a2_, and so on, while the washer of
the first chest, _a_, of the series delivers into a discharge pipe,
_e_, through which the liquid may be permitted to run to waste or
conveyed to any suitable receptacle, if it is desired to subject
it to chemical action for the purpose of renewing its bleaching
powers or obtaining the chemical agents that may be contained within
it.

The operation of the washers in removing the liquid from the upper
part of the chest tends to thicken the pulp therein, and the said
thickened pulp is conveyed from one chest to the next in the series
by any suitable conveying device, _f_ (shown in this instance as a
worm working in a trough or case, _f2_), which may be made foraminous
for the purpose of permitting the liquid to drain out of the pulp
that is being carried through by the worm, in order that the pulp
may be introduced into the next chest of the series as free as
possible from the liquid in which it has been suspended while in
the chest from which it is just taken.

The pulp is thus conveyed from one chest in the series to the
inlet passage leading to the next chest of the series, and in the
said inlet passage it meets the liquid coming in the reverse order
from the next chest beyond in the series, the pulp and liquid thus
commingling in the inlet pipe and entering the chest together, and
being thoroughly mixed by the agitators in passing through the chest
by the continued action of fresh material entering and of the
conveyors taking the material out from the chests.

In the last of the series of chests into which the pulp is introduced
the fresh or strong bleaching liquid is introduced through a
suitable inlet pipe, _g_, and the pulp conveyor, _f_, that takes the
pulp from the last chest, delivers it into a pipe, _h_, by which
it may be conveyed to any desired point, the said pulp having been
sufficiently bleached before arriving at the said pipe, _h_.

It will be seen that by these means all the pulp is thoroughly and
uniformly subjected to the bleaching agent and that the bleaching
is gradually performed in all parts of the pulp, which is first
acted upon by the weaker bleaching agent that has previously operated
upon the pulp before treated, and that finally, when nearly bleached,
the pulp is acted upon by the bleaching material of full strength,
this action being far more efficient than when the materials are
simply mixed together, the unbleached material with the strong
bleaching agent, and allowed to remain together until the bleaching
operation is finished, in which plan the bleaching agent loses its
strength as the bleaching operation approaches completion, so that
when the pulp is nearly bleached it is operated upon by a very weak
bleaching agent.

By having the pulp transferred from one chest to the next in
the reverse order to that in which the liquid is transferred it
will be seen that all parts of the pulp are acted upon uniformly
and equally and that the operation may go on continuously for an
indefinite period of time without necessitating stopping to empty
the vats, as is the case when the liquor only is transferred from
one vat to the next.

A pump may be used for lifting the bleaching liquid, as shown, for
example, at _k_, Fig. 1. where said pump is used to raise the
liquid delivered from the chest, _a2_, and discharge it into the
trough, _m_, by which the pulp is carried to the inlet pipe, _b_.

By the use of the pump, _h_, a stronger flow of the liquid into the
pipe _b_, of the first chest, _a_, is effected than if it were taken
directly from the washer of the chest, _a2_, which is desirable,
as the pulp is delivered in the trough, _m_, with but little
moisture.

It is obvious that the construction of the apparatus may be varied
considerably without materially changing the essential features of
operation.

For example, the washers might be dispensed with and the liquid permitted
to flow through suitable strainers from one chest to the next in
order, by gravity, the successive chests in the order of the passage
of the pulp being placed each at a higher level than the preceding
one, and it is also obvious that the construction of the pulp
conveyors might be widely varied, it being essential only that means
should be provided for removing the pulp from one chest and delivering
it into the next while carrying only a small amount of the liquid
from one chest to the next with the pulp

THE USE OF COMPRESSED AIR IN CONJUNCTION WITH MEDICINAL SOLUTIONS
IN THE TREATMENT OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL AFFECTIONS.

BEING A NEW SYSTEM OF CEREBRO-SPINAL THERAPEUTICS.

By J. LEONARD CORNING, A.M., M.D., New York, Consultant in Nervous
Diseases to St. Francis Hospital, St.

Mary's Hospital, the Hackensack Hospital, etc.

To merely facilitate the introduction of medicinal agents into the
system by way of the air passages, in the form of gases, medicated
or non-medicated, has heretofore constituted the principal motive
among physicians for invoking the aid of compressed air.

The experiments of Paul Bert with nitrous oxide and oxygen gas,
performed over fourteen years ago, and the more recent proposals of
See, are illustrations in point.

The objects of which I have been in search are quite different from
the foregoing, and have reference not to the introduction of the
remedy, but to the enhancement of its effects after exhibition.

Bethune turns from the window and advances towards
Margaret. There is a sudden fury in her eyes.

"What do you mean?" says she, stopping short before Miss Knollys,
and speaking with ill-suppressed rage. "Who is _she_, that she
should refuse him? That little, contemptible child! That nobody! I
tell you, she would not dare refuse him if she asked her! It would
be too great an honour for her."

She stops. Her fingers tighten on her gown. Then, as suddenly as it
grew, her ungovernable fit of anger seems to die checked, killed by
her own will. She sinks into the chair behind her, and looks
deliberately at Margaret with an air that, if not altogether
smiling, is certainly altogether calm. It must have cost her a good
deal to do it.

"It is beyond argument," says she; "he will not ask her."

"He _shall,"_ says Lady Rylton in a low tone.

Margaret rises, and moves slowly towards one of the open windows;
she pauses there a moment, then steps out on to the balcony, and so
escapes. These incessant discussions are abhorrent to her, and just
now her heart is sad for the poor child who has been brought down
here ostensibly for amusement, in reality for business. Of course,
Maurice will not marry her--she knows Maurice, he is far above all
that sort of thing; but the very attempt at the marriage seems to
cover the poor child with insult. And she is such a pretty child.

At this moment the pretty child, with Randal Gower, comes round the
corner; she has her skirt caught up at one side, and Miss Knollys
can see it is full of broken biscuits. The pulling up of the skirt
conduces a good deal to the showing of a lovely little foot and
ankle, and Margaret, who has the word "hoyden" still ringing in her
ears, and can see Lady Rylton's cold, aristocratic, disdainful face,
wishes the girl had had the biscuit in a basket.

"Oh, here is Miss Knollys!" cries Tita, running to her. "We are going
to feed the swans" (she looks back at her companion). "He has got
some more biscuits in his pockets."

"It's quite true," says Mr. Gower; "I'm nothing but biscuits. Every
pocket's full of 'em, and they've gone to dust. I tried to blow my
nose a moment ago, but I couldn't. One can't blow one's nose in
biscuit."

"Come with us, Miss Knollys--do," says Tita coaxingly.

"I can't. Not now. I can't," says Margaret, who is a little troubled
at heart. "Go, dear child, and feed the swans, and take care of her,
Randy--take care of her."

"I'll do my best," says Mr. Gower, with much solemnity; "but it's
small--very small. As a rule, Miss Bolton takes care of me."

Margaret gives him a last admonitory glance and turns away. In
truth, Mr. Gower is but a broken reed to lean upon.


CHAPTER III.

HOW LADY RYLTON SAYS A FEW THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER LEFT
UNSAID. HOW "THE SCHEME" IS LAID BEFORE SIR MAURICE, AND HOW HE
REFUSES TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.


In the meantime the conversation in the drawing-room has been going
on.

"Of course, if you think you can persuade him," says Mrs. Bethune
presently.

"I know I shall. One can always persuade a man where his interests
lie. Besides, I have great weight with him. I tell you I shall
manage him. I could always manage his father."

A curious expression crosses Mrs. Bethune's face. The present
Baronet may not prove so easy of management as his father!

"Well, I can only wish you success," says she, with a shrug. "By the
way, Margaret did not back you up in this scheme as cordially as I
deemed possible."

"Margaret is troublesome," says Lady Rylton. "Just when you expect
her to sympathize with you, she starts off at a tangent on some
other absurd idea. She is full of fads. After all, it would be rash
to depend on her. But _you_, Marian--you owe me much."

"How much? My life's blood?"

Mrs. Bethune lets her hands fall clasped upon her knees, and,
leaning over them, looks at her aunt--such a wonderfully young aunt,
with her yellow hair and her sparkling eyes! Marian's lips have
taken a cynical turn; her smile now is unpleasant.

"What a hideous expression!" says Lady Rylton, shuddering. "You
spoil yourself, Marian; you do indeed. You will never make a good
marriage if you talk like that. 'Life's blood'!--_detestable!"_

"I don't desire a good marriage, as _you_ regard it."

Lady Rylton sits suddenly quite upright.

"If you mean marriage with Maurice," says she, "put that out of your
head. You must be mad to cherish such a hope. You are both paupers,
for one thing, and for the rest, I assure you, my dear, Maurice is
not as infatuated about you as you are about him!"

Mrs. Bethune makes a sudden movement; it is slight. Her face
darkens. One reading between the lines might at this moment see that
she could have killed Lady Rylton with a wondrous joy. Killing has
its consequences, however, and she only stands quite quiet, looking
at her foe. What a look it is!

"It is you who are mad," says she calmly. "What I meant was that I
should probably marry some rich nobody for the sake of his wealth.
It would be quite in my line. I should arrange him, form him, bring
him into Society, even against Society's will! There is a certain
excitement in the adventure. As for Maurice, he is no doubt in your
eyes a demigod--in mine," with infinite contempt, "he is a man."

"Well, I hope you will keep to all that," says Lady Rylton, who is
shrewd as she is cruel, "and that you will not interfere with this
marriage I have arranged for Maurice."

"Why would I interfere?"

"Because you interfere always. You can't bear to see any man love
any woman but yourself."

Mrs. Bethune smiles. "A common fault. It belongs to most women. But
this girl--you like her?"

"On the contrary, as I have told you, I detest her. Once Maurice has
her money safely in his hands, I shall know how to deal with her. A
little, ignorant, detestable child! I tell you, Marian, that the
time will come when I shall pay her out for her silly insolence
towards me."

"She is evidently going to have a good time if Maurice proposes to
her."

"He _shall_ propose. Why----" She breaks off suddenly. "Not another
word," says she, putting up her hand. "Here is Maurice. I shall
speak to him now."

"Shall I stay and help you?"

"No, thank you," says Lady Rylton, with a little knowing grimace.

Seeing it, Marian's detestation grows apace. She rises--and calmly,
yet swiftly, leaves the room. Sir Maurice is only crossing the lawn
now, and by running through the hall outside, and getting on to the
veranda outside the dining-room window, she can see him before he
enters the drawing-room.

Gaining the veranda, she leans over the railings and makes a signal
to him; it is an old signal. Rylton responds to it, and in a second
is by her side.

"Oh no, you must not stay; your mother is waiting for you in the
south drawing-room. She saw you coming; she wants you."

"Well, but about what?" asks Rylton, naturally bewildered.

"Nothing--only--she is going to advise you for your good. Shall I,"
smiling at him in her beautiful way, and laying one hand upon his
breast--"shall I advise you, too?"

"Yes, yes," says Rylton; he takes the hand lying on his breast and
lifts it to his lips. "Advise me."

"Ah, no!" She pauses, a most eloquent pause, filled with a long deep
glance from her dark eyes. _"There, go!"_ she says, suddenly pushing
him from her.

"But your advice?" asks he, holding her.

"Pouf! as if that was worth anything." She looks up at him from
under her lowered lids. "Well, take it. My advice to you is to come
to the rose-garden as soon as possible, and see the roses before
they fade out of all recognition! _I_ am going there now. You know
how I love that rose-garden; I almost live there nowadays."

"I wish I could live there too," says Rylton, laughing.

He lifts her hand again and presses it fondly to his lips.
Something, however, in his air, though it had breathed devotion,
troubles Mrs. Bethune; she frowns as he leaves her, and, turning
into a side-path the leads to the rose-garden, gives herself up a
prey to thought.


  *  *  *  *  *


Rylton, with a shrug, goes toward the room where Marian had told him
his mother was awaiting him. He could very readily (as Lady Rylton
had not formally requested his presence) have stayed away, but long
experience has driven into him the knowledge that when his mother
wants anything, all the delays and subterfuges and evasions in the
world will not prevent her having it. To get it over, then, as soon
as possible is the chief thing. And, after all, he is so far happy
in that he knows what the immediate interview is to be about. That
little ridiculous girl--not half a bad little girl--but----

It is with quite a resigned air that he seats himself on the lounge,
and agrees with himself to make his mother happy by letting her talk
to him uninterruptedly for ten minutes.

"Women like to talk," says Sir Maurice to himself, as he sits on the
lounge where Marian had just now sat. He finds consolation in his
mother's poodle, who climbs on his knees, giving herself up a
willing prey to his teasing.

"Maurice, you are not attending," says Lady Rylton at last, with a
touch of serious anger.

"I am indeed--I am, I assure you," says Maurice, looking up. "If I'm
not, it's your poodle's fault; she is such a fascinating creature."

As he says this he makes a little attack on the poodle, who snaps
back at him, barking vigorously, and evidently enjoying herself
immensely.

"I want a decisive answer from you," says his mother.

"A decisive answer! How can I give that?"

He is still laughing, but even as he laughs a sound from without
checks him. It is another laugh--happy, young, joyous. Instinctively
both he and Lady Rylton look towards the open window. There below,
still attended by Mr. Gower, and coming back from her charitable
visit to the swans, is Tita, her little head upheld, her bright eyes
smiling, her lips parted. There is a sense of picturesque youth
about the child that catches Rylton's attention, and holds it for
the moment.

"There she is," says he at last, looking back over his shoulder at
his mother. "Is _that_ the wife you have meted out for me--that
baby?"

"Be serious about it, Maurice; it is a serious latter, I assure
you."

"Fancy being serious with a baby! She's too young, my dear mother.
She couldn't know her duty to her neighbours yet, to say nothing of
her duty to her husband."

"You could teach her."

"I doubt it. They have taken that duty off nowadays, haven't they?"
He is still looking at Tita through the window; her gay little laugh
comes up to him again. "Do you know, she is very pretty," says he
dispassionately; "and what a little thing! She always makes me think
of a bird, or a mouse, or a----"

"Think of her as a girl," says his mother impatiently.

"Certainly. After all, it would be impossible to think of her as a
boy; she's too small."

"I don't know about that," said Lady Rylton, shrugging her
shoulders. "She's much more a boy than a girl, where her manners are
concerned."

"Poor little hoyden! That's what you call her, isn't it--a hoyden?"

"Did Marian tell you that?"

"Marian? Certainly not!" says Sir Maurice, telling his lie
beautifully. "Marian thinks her beneath notion. So would you,
if----" He pauses. "If she hadn't a penny you wouldn't know her," he
says presently; "and you admit she has no manners, yet you ask me to
marry her. Now, if I did marry her, what should I do with her?"

"Educate her! Control her! Says his mother, a little viciously.

"I confess I am not equal to the occasion. I could not manage a
baby. The situation doesn't suit me."

"Maurice--it _must!"_ Lady Rylton rises, and, standing near him with
her hand on the table, looks at him with a pale face. "You find
fault with her; so do I, and frankly admit she is the last woman in
the world I should have chosen for you if I could help it, but she
is one of the richest girls in England. And after all, though I
detest the very sound of it, Trade is now our master. You object to
the girl's youth; that, however, is in her favour. You can mould her
to your own designs, and"--she casts a bitter glance at him that
will not be suppressed--"all women cannot be widows. Then, as for
her being so little a creature, she is surely quite as tall as I am,
and your father--you know, Maurice, how devoted he was to me."

"Oh yes, poor old Dad!" says Maurice, with a movement that might
mean pain. He seldom speaks of his father--_never_ to his mother. He
had certainly loved his father. He moves quickly to the further end
of the room.

"You will think of this girl, Maurice?"

"Oh, if that's all," laughing shortly, "you have arranged for that.
One can't help thinking of the thing that is thrust under one's eyes
morning, noon, and night. I shall think of her certainly until she
goes away." He stops, and then says abruptly, "When is she going?"

"When her engagement to you is an accomplished fact."

"My dear mother, how absurd it all is! Poor little girl, and what a
shame too! She doesn't even like me! We shouldn't be taking her name
in vain like this. By-the-bye, what queer eyes she has!--have you
noticed?"

"She has two hundred thousand pounds," says Lady Rylton solemnly.
"That is of far greater consequence. You know how it is with us,
Maurice. We can hold on very little longer. If you persist in
refusing this last chance, the old home will have to go. We shall be
beggars!" She sinks back in her chair, and sobs softly but bitterly.

"Don't go on like that--don't!" says Rylton, coming over to her and
patting her shoulder tenderly. "There must be some other way out of
it. I know we are in a hole more or less, but----"

"How lightly you speak of it! Who is to pay your debts? You know how
your gambling on the turf has ruined us--brought us to the very
verge of disgrace and penury, and now, when you _can _help to set
the old name straight again, you refuse--refuse!" She stops as if
choking.

"I don't think my gambling debts are the actual cause of our
worries," says her son, rather coldly. "If I have wasted a few
hundred on a race here and there, it is all I have done. When the
property came into my hands it was dipped very deeply."

"You would accuse your father----" begins she hotly.

Rylton pauses. "No; not my father," says he distinctly, if gently.

"You mean, then, that you accuse _me!"_ cries she, flashing round at
him.

All at once her singularly youthful face grows as old as it ought to
be--a vindictive curve round the mouth makes that usually charming
feature almost repulsive.

"My dear mother, let us avoid a scene," says her son sternly. "To
tell you the truth, I have had too many of them of late."

Something in his manner warns her to go no farther in the late
direction. If she is to win the cause so close to her heart, she had
better refrain from recrimination--from an accusation of any sort.

"Dearest Maurice," says she, going to him and taking his hand in
hers, "you know it is for your sake only I press this dreadful
matter. She is so rich, and you--we--are so poor! She has a house in
Surrey, and one in the North--delightful places, I have been
told--and, of course, she would like you to keep up your own house
in town. As for me, all I ask is this old house--bare and
uncomfortable as it is."

"Nonsense, mother," letting her hand go and turning away
impatiently. "You speak as if it were all settled."

"Why should it _not_ be settled?"

"You talk without thinking!" He is frowning now, and his tone is
growing angry. "Am I the only one to be consulted?"

"Oh! as for her--that child! Of course you can influence her."

"I don't want to," wearily.

"You can do more than that. You are very good-looking, Maurice. You
can----" She hesitates.

"Can what?" coldly.

"Fascinate her."

"I shall certainly not even try to do that. Good heavens! what do
you mean?" says her son, colouring a dark red with very shame. "Are
you asking me to make love to this girl--to pretend an admiration
for her that I do not feel? To--to--_lie_ to her?"

"I am only asking you to be sensible," says his mother sullenly. She
has gone back to her chair, and now, with lowered lids and
compressed lips, is fanning herself angrily.

"I shan't be sensible in that way," says her son, very hotly. "Put
it out of your head. To me Miss Bolton (it is really ridiculous to
call her Miss anything; she ought to be Betty, or Lizzie, or Lily,
or whatever her name is, to everyone at her age)--to me she seems
nothing but a baby--and--I _hate_ babies!"

"Marian has taught you!" Says his mother, with a sneer. "_She_
certainly is not a baby, whatever else she may be. But I tell you
this, Maurice, that you will hate far more being left a beggar in
the world, without enough money to keep yourself alive."

"I am sure I can keep myself alive."

"Yes, but how? _You_, who have been petted and pampered all your
life?"

"Oh, _don't_ speak to me as if I were in the cradle!" says Maurice,
with a shrug.

"Do you never think?"

"Sometimes".

"Oh yes, of Marian. That designing woman! Do you believe _I_ haven't
read her, if you are still blind? She will hold you on and on and
on. And if your uncle _should_ chance to die, why, then she will
marry you; but if in the meantime she meets anyone with money who
will marry her, why, good-bye to _you_. But you must not marry! Mind
that! You must be held in chains whilst she goes free. Really,
Maurice," rising and regarding him with extreme contempt, "your
folly is so great over this absurd infatuation for Marian, that
sometimes I wonder if you can be my own son."

"I am my father's son also," says Maurice. "He, I believe, did
sometimes believe in somebody. He believed in you."

He turns away abruptly, and an inward laugh troubles him. Was that
last gibe not an argument against himself, his judgment? Like his
father; _is_ he like his father? Can he, too, see only gold where
dross lies deep? Sometimes, of late he has doubted. The laughter
dies away, he sighs heavily.

"He was wise," says Lady Rylton coolly. "He had no cause to regret
his belief. But you, you sit in a corner, as it were, and see
nothing but Marian smiling. You never see Marian frowning. Your
corner suits you. It would trouble you too much to come out into the
middle of the room and look around Marian. And in the end what will
it all come to? _Nothing!"_

"Then why make yourself so unhappy about nothing?"

"Because----"

"My dear mother," turning rather fiercely on her, "let us have an
end of this. Marian would not marry me. She has refused me many
times."

"I am quite aware of that," says Lady Rylton calmly. "She has taken
care to tell me so. She will never marry you unless you get your
uncle's money (and he is as likely to live to be a Methuselah as
anyone I ever saw; the scandalous way in which he takes care of his
health is really a byword!), but she will hold you on until----"

"I asked you not to go on with this," says Rylton, interrupting he
again. "If you have nothing better to say to me than the abuse of
Marian, I----"

"But I have. What is Marian, what is _anything_ to me except your
marriage with Tita Bolton? Maurice, think of it. Promise me you will
think of it. Maurice, don't go."

She runs to him, lays her hand on his arm, and tries to hold him.

"I must." He lifts her hand from his arm, presses it, and drops it
deliberately. "My dear mother, I can't; I can't, really," says he.

She stands quite still. As he reaches the door, he looks back. She
is evidently crying. A pang shoots through his heart. But it is all
so utterly impossible. To marry that absurd child! It is out of
question. Still, her tears trouble him. He can see her crying as he
crosses the hall, and then her words begin to trouble him even more.
What was it she had said about Marian? It was a hint, a very broad
one. It meant that Marian might love him if he were a poor man, but
could love him much more if he were a rich one. As a fact, she would
marry him if he had money, but not if he were penniless. After all,
why not? She, Marian, had often said all that to him, or at least
some of it. But that other word, of her marrying some other man
should he appear----


CHAPTER IV.

HOW THE HEART OF MAURICE GREW HOT WITHIN HIM, AND HOW HE PUT THE
QUESTION TO THE TOUCH, AND HOW HE NEITHER LOST NOR WON.


Mrs. Bethune, sauntering slowly between the bushes laden with
exquisite blooms, all white and red and yellow, looks up as he
approaches her with a charming start.

"You!" she says, smiling, and holding out her hand--a large hand but
beautiful. "It is my favourite spot. But that _you_ should have come
here too!"

"You knew I should come!" returns he gravely. Something in her
charming air of surprise jars upon him at this moment. Why should
she pretend?--and to him!

"I knew?"

"You told me you were coming here."

"Ah, what a lovely answer!" says she, with a glance from under her
long lashes, that--whatever her answer may be--certainly _is_
lovely.

Rylton regards her moodily. If she really loved him, would she
coquet with him like this--would she so pretend? All in a second, as
he stands looking at her, the whole of the past year comes back to
him. A strange year, fraught with gladness and deep pain--with fears
and joys intense! What had it all meant? If anything, it had meant
devotion to her--to his cousin, who, widowed, all but penniless, had
been flung by the adverse winds of Fate into his home.

She was the only daughter of Lady Rylton's only brother, and the
latter had taken her in, and in a measure adopted her. It was a
strange step for her to take--for one so little led by kindly
impulses, or rather for one who had so few kindly impulses to be led
by; but everyone has a soft spot somewhere in his heart, and Lady
Rylton had loved her brother, good-for-nothing as he was. There
might have been a touch of remorse, too, in her charity; she had
made Marian's marriage!

Grudgingly, coldly, she opened her son's doors to her niece, but
still she opened them. She was quite at liberty to do this, as
Maurice was seldom at home, and gave her always _carte blanche_ to
do as she would with all that belonged to him. She made Marian
Bethune's life for the first few months a burden to her, and then
Marian Bethune, who had waited, took the reins in a measure; at all
events, she made herself so useful to Lady Rylton that the latter
could hardly get on without her.

Maurice had fallen in love with her almost at once; insensibly but
thoroughly. There had been an hour in which he had flung himself,
metaphorically, at her feet (one never does the real thing now,
because it spoils one's trousers so), and offered his heart, and all
the fortune still left to him after his mother's reign; and Marian
had refused it all, very tenderly, very sympathetically, very
regretfully--to tell the truth--but she _had_ refused it.

She had sweetened the refusal by declaring that, as she could not
marry him--as she could not to be so selfish as to ruin his
prospects--she would never marry at all. She had looked lovely in
the light of the dying sunset as she said all this to him, and
Maurice had believed in her a thousand times more than before, and
had loved her a thousand times deeper. And in a sense his belief was
justified. She did love him, as she had never loved before, but not
well enough to risk poverty again. She had seen enough of that in
her first marriage, and in her degradation and misery had sworn a
bitter oath to herself never again to marry, unless marriage should
sweep her into the broad river of luxury and content. Had Maurice's
financial affairs been all they ought to have been but for his
mother's extravagances, she undoubtedly would have chosen him before
all the world; but Maurice's fortunes were (and are) at a low ebb,
and she would risk nothing. His uncle _might_ die, and then Maurice,
who was his heir, would be a rich man; but his uncle was only
sixty-five, and he might marry again, and---- No, she would refuse!

Rylton had pressed his suit many times, but she had never yielded.
It was always the same argument, she would not ruin _him_. But one
day--only the other day, indeed--she had said something that made
him know she sometimes counted on his uncle's death. She would marry
him then! She would not marry a poor man, however much she loved
him. The thought that she was waiting for his uncle's death revolted
him at the moment, and though he forgave her afterwards, still the
thought rankled.

It hurt him, in a sense, that she could _desire_ death--the death of
another--to create her own content.

His mother had hinted at it only just now! Marian feared, she
said--feared to step aboard his sinking ship. Where, then, was her
love, that perfect love that casteth out all fear?

A wave of anger rushes over him as he looks at her now--smiling,
fair, with large, deep, gleaming eyes. He tells himself he will know
at once what it is she means--what is the worth of her love.

She is leaning towards him, a soft red rosebud crushed against her
lips.

"Ah, yes! It is true. I _did_ know you were coming," says she
tenderly.

She gives a hasty, an almost imperceptible glance around. Lady
Rylton is often a little--just a _little_--prone to
prying--especially of late; ever since the arrival of that small
impossible heiress, for example; and then very softly she slips her
hand into his.

"What an evening!" says she with delicate fervour. "How sweet, how
perfect, Maurice!"

"Well?" in a rather cold, uncompromising way.

Mrs. Bethune gives him a quick glance.

"What a tone!" says she; "you frighten me!"

She laughs softly, sweetly. She draws closer to him--closer
still;--and, laying her cheek against his arm, rubs it lightly,
caressingly, up and down.

"Look here!" says he quickly, catching her by both arms, and holding
her a little away from him; "I have a question to ask you."

"There is always a question," says she, smiling still, "between
friends and foes, then why not between--_lovers?"_

She lingers over the word, and, stooping her graceful head, runs her
lips lightly across the hand that is holding her right arm.

A shiver runs through Rylton. Is she true or false? But, however it
goes, how exquisite she is!

"And now your question," says she; "how slow you are to ask it. Now
_what_ is it?--what--what?"

"Shall I ask it, Marian? I have asked it too often before."

He is holding her arms very tightly now, and his eyes are bent on
hers. Once again he is under the spell of her beauty.

"Ask--ask what you will!" cries she. She laughs gaily, and throws
back her head. The last rays of the sunlight catch her hair, and
lift it to a very glory round her beautiful face. "Go on, go on,"
she says lightly. There is, perhaps, some defiance in her tone, but,
if so, it only strengthens her for the fight. "I am your captive!"
She gives a little expressive downward glance at his hands, as he
holds her arms. "Speak, my lord! and your slave answers." She has
thrown some mockery into her tone.

"I am not your lord," says Rylton. He drops her arms, and lets her
go, and stands well back from her. "That is the last part assigned
to me."

Mrs. Bethune's gaze grows concentrated. It is fixed on him. What
does he mean? What is the object of this flat rebellion--this
receding from her authority? Strength is hers, as well as charm, and
she comes to the front bravely.

"Now what _is_ it?" asks she, creeping up to him again, and now
slipping her arm around his neck. "How have I vexed you? Who has
been saying nasty little things about me? The dear mother, eh?"

"I want no one to tell me anything, but you."

"Speak, then; did I not tell you I should answer?"

"I want an answer to one question, and one only," says Rylton
slowly.

"That is modesty itself."

"Will you marry me?"

"Marry you?" She repeats his words almost in a whisper, her eyes on
the ground, then suddenly she uplifts her graceful form, and, lazily
clasping her arms behind her head, looks at him. "Surely we have
been through this before," says she, with a touch of reproach.

"Many times!" His lips have grown into a rather straight line.
"Still I repeat my question."

"Am I so selfish as this in your eyes?" asks she. "Is it thus you
regard me?" Her large eyes have grown quite full of tears. "Is my
own happiness so much to me that for the sake of it I would
deliberately ruin yours?"

"It would not ruin mine! Marry me, Marian, if--you love me!"

"You know I love you." Her voice is tremulous now and her face very
pale. "But _how_ can we marry? I am a beggar, and you----"

"The same!" returns he shortly. "We are in the same boat."

"Still, one must think."

"And you are the one. Do you know, Marian"--he pauses, and then goes
on deliberately--"I have been thinking, too, and I have come to the
conclusion that when one truly loves, one never calculates."

"Not even for the one beloved?"

"For no one!"

"Is love, then, only selfishness incarnate?"

"I cannot answer that. It is a great mixture; but, whatever it is,
it rules the world, or should rule it. It rules _me_. You tell
me--you are for ever telling me--that marriage with you, who are
penniless, would be my ruin, and yet I would marry you. Is _that
_selfishness?"

"No; it is only folly," says she in a low, curious tone.

Maurice regards her curiously.

"Marian," says he quickly, impulsively, "there are other places. If
you would come abroad with me, I could carve out a fresh life for
us--I could work for you, live for you, endure all things for you.
Come! come!"

He holds out his hands to her.

"But why--why not wait?" exclaims she with deep agitation. "Your
uncle--he _cannot_ live for ever."

"I detest dead men's shoes," returns he coldly. Her last words have
chilled him to his heart's core. "And besides, my uncle has as good
a life as my own."

To this she makes no answer; her eyes are downbent. Rylton's face is
growing hard and cold.

"You refuse, then?" says he at last.

"I refuse nothing, but----" She breaks off. "Maurice," cries she
passionately, "why do you talk to me like this? What has changed
you? Your mother? Ah, I know it! She has set her heart on your
marriage with this--this little _nobody_, and she is poisoning your
mind against me. But you--_you_--you will not forsake me for her!"

"It is you who are forsaking me," returns he violently. "Am I
nothing to you, except as a medium by which you may acquire all the
luxuries that women seem ready to sell their very souls for? Come,
Marian, rose above it all. I am a poor man, but I am young, and I
can work. Marry me as I am, and for what I am in your sight, and
seek a new life with me abroad."

"It is madness," says she, in a voice so low as to be almost
inaudible. For a short, _short_ minute the plan held out to her had
tempted her, but something stronger than her love prevailed. She
could wait--she _would;_ and she is so sure of him. He is her own,
her special property. Yes! she can afford to wait. Something must
occur shortly to change the state of his affairs, and even if things
come to the very worst--there are others. "I tell you," says she,
"that I will not spoil your life. Your uncle--he would be furious if
you married me, and----"

Rylton put her somewhat roughly from him.

"I am tired of that old excuse," says he, his tone even rougher than
his gesture. He turns away.

"Maurice!" says she sharply--there is real anguish in her tone, her
face has grown white as death--"Maurice, come back." She holds out
her arms to him. "Oh--darling, do not let your mother come between
us! That girl--she will _make_ you marry that girl. She has money,
whereas I--what am I? A mere castaway on life's sea! Yes, yes." She
covers her face with her hands in a little paroxysm of despair.
"Yes," faintly, "you will marry that girl."

"Well, why not?" sullenly. He is as white as she is--his face is
stern. "If she will deign to accept me. I have not so far," with a
bitter laugh, "been very successful in love affairs."

"Oh! _How_ can you say that--and to me?"

She bursts into tears, and in a moment he has her in his arms. His
beautiful darling! He soothes her, caresses her, lets her weave the
bands of her fascination over him all fresh again.

It is only afterwards he remembers that through all her grief and
love she had never so forgotten herself as to promise to exile
herself for his sake in a foreign land.


CHAPTER V.

SHOWING HOW, WHEN PEOPLE DO CONGREGATE TOGETHER, MUCH KNOWLEDGE MAY
BE FOUND, AND HOW THE LITTLE HOYDEN HAD SOME KIND THINGS SAID ABOUT
HER.


"Game and set," cries Tita at the top of her young voice, from the
other end the court. It would be useless to pretend she doesn't
_shout_ it. She is elated--happy. She has won. She tears off the
little soft round cap that, defiant of the sun, she wears, and
flings it sky-high, catching it deftly as it descends upon the top
of her dainty head, a _little_ sideways. Her pretty, soft, fluffy
hair, cut short, and curled all over her head by Mother Nature, is
flying a little wildly across her brows, her large gray eyes (that
sometimes are so nearly black) are brilliant. Altogether she is just
a little, a _very_ little, pronounced in her behaviour. Her
opponents, people who have come over to The Place for the day,
whisper something to each other, and laugh a little. After all, they
have lost--perhaps they are somewhat spiteful. Lady Rylton, sitting
on the terrace above, bites her lips. What an impossible girl! and
yet how rich! Things must be wrong somewhere, when Fate showers
money on such a little ill-bred creature.

"How funny she is!" says Mrs. Chichester, who is sitting near Lady
Rylton, a guest at The Place in this house-party, this last big
entertainment, that is to make or mar its master. Lady Rylton had
organized it, and Sir Maurice, who never contradicted her, and who
had not the slightest idea of the real meaning of it, had shrugged
his shoulders. After all, let her have her own way to the last.
There would be enough to pay the debts and a little over for her;
and for him, poverty, a new life, and emancipation. He is tired of
his mother's rule. "And how small!" goes on Mrs. Chichester, a tall
young woman with light hair and queer eyes, whose husband is abroad
with his regiment. "Like a doll. I love dolls; don't you, Captain
Marryatt?"

"Are _you_ a doll?" asks Captain Marryatt, who is leaning over her.

He is always leaning over her!

"I never know what I am," says Mrs. Chichester frankly, her queer
eyes growing a little queerer. "But Miss Bolton, how delightful she
is! so natural, and Nature is always so--so----"

"Natural!" supplies Mr. Gower, who is lying on a rug watching the
game below.

"Oh, get out!" says Mrs. Chichester, whose manners are not her
strong point.

She is sitting on a garden chair behind him, and she gives him a
little dig in the back with her foot as she speaks.

"Don't! I'm bad there!" says he.

"I believe you are bad everywhere," says she, with a pout.

"Then you believe wrong! My heart is a heart of gold," says Mr.
Gower ecstatically.

"I'd like to see it," says Mrs. Chichester, who is not above a
flirtation with a man whom she knows is beyond temptation; and truly
Randal Gower is hard to get at!

"Does that mean that you would gladly see me dead?" asks he. "Oh,
cruel woman!"

"I'm tired of seeing you as you are, any way," says she, tilting her
chin. "Why don't you fall in love with somebody, for goodness'
sake?"

"Well, I'm trying," says Mr. Gower, "I'm trying hard; but," looking
at her, "I don't seem to get on. You don't encourage me, you know,
and I'm very shy!"

"There, don't be stupid," says Mrs. Chichester, seeing that Marryatt
is growing a little enraged. "We were talking of Miss Bolton. We
were saying----"

"That she was Nature's child."

"Give me Nature!" says Captain Marryatt, breaking into the
_tête-à-tête_ a little sulkily. "Nothing like it."

"Is that a proposal?" demands Mr. Gower, raising himself on his
elbow, and addressing him with deep interest. "It cannot be _Mrs._
Bolton you refer to, as she is unfortunately dead. Nature's child,
however, is still among us. Shall I convey your offer to her?"

"Yes, shall he?" asks Mrs. Chichester.

She casts a teasing glance at her admirer; a little amused light has
come into her green-gray eyes.

"I should think _you,_ Randal, would be the fitting person to
propose to her, considering how you haunt her footsteps day and
night," says a strange voice.

It comes from a tall, gaunt old lady, who, with ringlets flying,
advances towards the group. She is a cousin of the late Sir Maurice,
and an aunt of Gower's, from whom much is to be expected by the
latter at her death. There is therefore, as you see, a cousinship
between the Gowers and the Ryltons.

"My dear aunt, is that you?" says Mr. Gower with enthusiasm. "Come
and sit here; _do,_ just here _beside_ me!"

He pats the rug on which he is reclining as he speaks, beckoning her
warmly to it, knowing as he well does that her bones would break if
she tried to bring them to so low a level.

"Thank you, Randal, I prefer a more elevated position," replies she
austerely.

"Ah, you would! you would!" says Randal, who really ought to be
ashamed of himself. "You were meant for high places."

He sighs loudly, and goes back on his rug.

"Miss Gower is right," says Mrs. Bethune gaily, who has just
arrived. "Why don't _you_ go in for Miss Bolton?"

"She wouldn't have me!" says Gower tragically. "I've hinted all
sorts of lovely things to her during the past week, but she has been
apparently blind to the brilliant prospects opened to her. It has
been my unhappy lot to learn that she prefers lollipops to lovers."

"You tried her?" asks Mrs. Chichester.

"Well, I believe I _did_ do a good deal in the chocolate-cream
business," says Mr. Gower mildly.

"And she preferred the creams?"

"Oh! much, _much!"_ says Gower.

"So artless of her," says Mrs. Bethune, with a shrug. "I do love the
nineteenth-century child!"

"If you mean Miss Bolton, so do I," says a young man who has been
listening to them, and laughing here and there--a man from the
Cavalry Barracks at Ashbridge. "She's quite out-of-the-way
charming."

Mrs. Bethune looks at him--he is only a boy and easily to be
subdued, and she is glad of the opportunity of giving some little
play to the jealous anger that is raging within her.

"She has a hundred thousand charming ways," says she, smiling, but
very unpleasantly. "An heiress is always charming."

"Oh no! I didn't look at it in that way at all," says the boy,
reddening furiously. "One wouldn't, you know--when looking at
_her."_

"Wouldn't one?" says Mrs. Bethune. She is smiling at him always; but
it is a fixed smile now, and even more bitter. "And yet one might,"
says she.

She speaks almost without knowing it. She is thinking of
Rylton--might _he?_

"I think not," says the boy, stammering.

It is his first lesson in the book that tells one that to praise a
woman to a woman is to bring one to confusion. It is the worst
manners possible.

"I agree with you, Woodleigh," says Gower, who is case-hardened and
doesn't care about his manners, and who rather dislikes Mrs.
Bethune. "She's got lovely little ways. Have _you_ noticed them?"

He looks direct at Marian.

"No," says she, shaking her head, but very sweetly. "But, then, I'm
so dull."

"Well, she has," says Gower, in quite a universally conversational
tone, looking round him. He turns himself on his rug, pulls a
cushion towards him, and lies down again. "And they're all her own,
too."

"What a comfort!" says Mrs. Bethune, rather nastily.

Gower looks at her.

"Yes, you're right," says he. "To be original--honestly original--is
the thing nowadays. Have you noticed when she laughs? Those little
slender shoulders of hers actually shake."

"My _dear_ Mr. Gower," says Mrs. Bethune, "do spare us! I'm sure you
must be portraying Miss Bolton wrongly. Emotion--to betray
emotion--how vulgar!"

"I like emotion," says Mr. Gower calmly; "I'm a perfect mass of it
myself. Have you noticed Miss Bolton's laugh, Rylton?" to Sir
Maurice, who had come up a moment ago, and had been listening to
Mrs. Bethune's last remark. "It seems to run all through her. Not an
inch that doesn't seem to enjoy it."

"Well, there aren't _many _inches," says Sir Maurice, with am amused
air.

"And the laugh itself--so gay."

"You are en enthusiast," says Sir Maurice, who is standing near Mrs.
Bethune.

"My dear fellow, who wouldn't be, in such a cause?" says the young
cavalryman, with a rather conscious laugh.

"Here she is," says Mrs. Chichester, who is one of those people whom
Nature has supplied with eyes behind and before.

Tita running up the slope at this moment like a young deer--a steep
embankment that would have puzzled a good many people--puts an
effectual end to the conversation. Mr. Gower graciously deigning to
give her half of his rug, she sinks upon it gladly. She likes Gower.

Lady Rylton calls to her.

"Not on the grass, Tita dearest," cries she, in her little shrill,
old-young voice. "Come here to me, darling. Next to me on this seat.
Marian," to Mrs. Bethune, who has been sitting on the garden-chair
with her, "you can make a little room, eh?"

"A great deal," says Marian.

She rises.

"Oh no! don't stir. Not for me," says Tita, making a little gesture
to her to reseat herself. "No, thank you, Lady Rylton; I shall stay
here. I'm quite happy here. I like sitting on the grass."

She makes herself a little more comfortable where she is, regardless
of the honour Lady Rylton would have done her--regardless, too, of
the frown with which her hostess now regards her.

Mr. Gower turns upon her a beaming countenance.

"What you really mean is," says he, "that you like sitting near
_me."_

"Indeed I do not," says Tita indignantly.

"My dear girl, _think_. Am I to understand, then, that you don't
like sitting near me?"

"Ah, that's a different thing," says Tita, with a little side-glance
at him that shows a disposition to laughter.

"You see! you see!" says Mr. Gower triumphantly--he has a talent for
teasing. "Then you do wish to sit beside me! And why not?" He
expands his hands amiably. "Could you be beside a more delightful
person?"

"Maybe I could," says Tita, with another glance.

Rylton, who is listening, laughs.

His laugh seems to sting Mrs. Bethune to her heart. She turns to
him, and lets her dark eyes rest on his.

"What a little flirt!" says she contemptuously.

"Oh no! a mere child," returns he.

"Miss Bolton! What an answer!" Gower is now at the height of his
enjoyment. "And after last night, too; you _must_ remember what you
said to me last night."

"Last night?" She is staring at him with a small surprised face--a
delightful little face, as sweet as early spring. "What did I say to
you last night?"

"And have you forgotten?" Mr. Gower has thrown tragedy into his
voice. _"Already?_ Do you mean to tell me that you don't recollect
saying to me that you preferred me to all the rest of my sex?"

"I _never_ said that!" says Tita, with emphasis; "never! never! Why
should I say that?"

She looks at Gower as if demanding an answer.

"I'm not good at conundrums," says he. "Ask me another."

"No; I won't," says she_. "Why?"_

Upon this Mr. Gower rolls himself over in the rug, and covers his
head. It is plain that answers are not to be got out of _him_.

"Did I say that?" says Tita, appealing to Sir Maurice.

"I hope not," returns he, laughing. "Certainly I did not hear it."

"And certainly he didn't either," says Tita with decision.

"After that," says Gower, unrolling himself, "I shall retire from
public life; I shall give myself up to"--he pauses and looks round;
a favourite ladies' paper is lying on the ground near him--"to
literature."

He turns over on his side, and apparently becomes engrosses in it.

"Have you been playing, Maurice?" asks Mrs. Bethune presently.

Her tone is cold. That little speech of his to Tita, uttered some
time ago, "I hope not," had angered her.

"No," returns he as coldly.

He is on one of his uncertain moods with regard to her. Distrust,
disbelief, a sense of hopelessness--all are troubling him.

"What a shame, Sir Maurice!" says Mrs. Chichester, leaning forward.
As I have hinted, she would have flirted with a broomstick. "And
you, who are our champion player."

"I'll play now if you will play with me," says Sir Maurice
gallantly.

"A safe answer," looking at him with a pout, and through half-closed
lids. She finds that sort of glance effective sometimes. "You know I
don't play."

"Not _that_ game," says Mr. Gower, who never can resist a thrust.

"I thought you were reading your paper," says Mrs. Chichester
sharply. "Come, what's in it? I don't believe," scornfully, "you are
reading it at all."

"I am, however," says Mr. Gower. "These ladies' papers are so full
of information. I'm quite enthralled just now. I've got on to the
Exchange and Mart business, and it's too exciting for _words_. Just
listen to this: 'Two dozen old tooth-brushes (in _good_
preservation) would be exchanged for a gold bangle (_unscratched_).
Would not be sent on approval (mind, it must not be set _scratched!_
good old toothbrushes!) without deposit of ten shillings. Address,
'Chizzler, office of this paper.'"

"It isn't true. I don't believe a word of it," says Tita, making a
snatch at the paper.

"My dear girl, why not? Two dozen old toothbrushes. _Old_
toothbrushes, you notice. Everything old now goes for a large sum,
except," thoughtfully, "aunts."

He casts a lingering glance round, but providentially Miss Gower has
disappeared.

"But toothbrushes! Show me that paper."

"Do you, then, disbelieve in my word?"

"Nobody could want a toothbrush."

"Some people want them awfully," says Mr. Gower. "Haven't you
noticed?"

But here Sir Maurice sees it his duty to interfere.

"Miss Bolton, will you play this next set with me?" says he, coming
up to Tita.

"Oh, I should _love_ it!" cries she. "You are so good a player. Do
get us some decent people to play against, though; I hate a weak
game."

"Well, come, we'll try and manage it," says he, amused at her
enthusiasm.

They move away together.


CHAPTER VI.

HOW GAMES WERE PLAYED, "OF SORTS"; AND HOW TITA WAS MUCH HARRIED,
BUT HOW SHE BORE HERSELF VALIANTLY, AND HOW, NOT KNOWING OF HER
VICTORIES, SHE WON ALL THROUGH.


There had been no question about it; it had been a walk-over. Even
Lord Eshurst and Miss Staines, who are considered quite crack people
at tennis in this part of the county, had not had a chance. Tita had
been everywhere; she seemed to fly. Every ball caught, and every
ball so well planted. Rylton had scarcely been in it, though a good
player. That little thing was here and there and everywhere, yet
Rylton could not say she poached. Whatever she did, however, she
_won_.

She does not throw up her cap this time--perhaps she had seen a
little of that laughter before--but she claps her hands joyfully,
and pats Rylton's arm afterwards in a _bon camarade_ fashion that
seems to amuse him. And is she tired? There is no sense of fatigue,
certainly, in the way she runs up the slope again, and flings
herself gracefully upon the rug beside Mr. Gower. Mr. Gower has not
stirred from that rug since. He seldom stirs. Perhaps he would not
be quite so stout if he did.

"You won your game?" says Margaret Knollys, bending towards Tita,
with a smile.

Old Lady Eshurst is smiling at her, too.

"Oh yes; how could I help it? Sir Maurice"--with a glance at the
latter as he climbs the slope in turn--"plays like an angel."

"Oh no; it is you who do that," says he, laughing.

"Are you an angel, Miss Bolton?" asks Mrs. Bethune, who is standing
next Rylton.

He had gone straight to her, but she had not forgiven his playing
with the girl at all, and a sense of hatred towards Tita is warming
her breast.

"I don't know," says Tita, with a slight grimace. It is not the
answer expected. Marian had expected to see her shy, confused; Tita,
on the contrary, is looking at her with calm, inquiring eyes. "Do
you?" asks she.

"I have not gone into it," says Mrs. Bethune, with as distinct a
sneer as she can allow herself.

Mr. Gower laughs.

"You're good at games," says he to Tita.

He might have meant her powers at tennis, he might have meant
_anything_.

"That last game you are thinking of?"

"Decidedly, the last game," says Gower, who laughs again
immoderately.

"I don't see what there is to laugh at," says Miss Bolton, with some
indignation. The object to be attained is that it shall receive
only an insignificant portion of current and that such portion
shall suffice to actuate it.

If connected in parallel with any portion of a circuit, it should not
noticeably diminish its resistance.

The divisions into which ammeters range themselves answer for
voltmeters. In practice the same construction is adopted for both.
The different definitions of ammeters in disclosing the general
lines of these instruments are in general applicable to voltmeters,
except that the wire winding of the coils must be of thin wire of
great length.

The definitions of ammeters may be consulted with the above
understanding for voltmeters.

In the use made of voltmeters there is a distinction from ammeters.

An ammeter is a current measurer and all the current measured must
be passed through it.

But while a voltmeter is in fact a current measurer, it is so graduated
and so used that it gives in its readings the difference of potential
existing between two places on a circuit, and while measuring the
current passing through its own coils, it is by calibration made
to give not the current intensity, but the electro-motive force
producing such current.

In use it may be connected to two terminals of an open circuit,
when as it only permits an inconsiderable current to pass, it
indicates the potential difference existing between such points
on open circuit.

Or it may be connected to any two parts of a closed circuit.

Owing to its high resistance, although it is in parallel with the
intervening portion of the circuit, as it is often connected in
practice, it is without any appreciable effect upon the current. It
will then indicate the potential difference existing between the two
points.

569 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

Voltmeter, Battery.

A voltmeter for use in running batteries. In one form (Wirt's) it is
constructed for a low range of voltage, reading up to two and a
half volts and having exactly one ohm resistance, thus giving the
battery some work to do.

Voltmeter, Cardew.

A voltmeter in which the current passing through its conductor
heats such conductor, causing it to expand. Its expansion is
caused to move an index needle. By calibration the movements of the
needle are made to correspond to the potential differences producing
the actuating currents through it.

The magnetic action of the current plays no part in its operation.
It is the invention of Capt. Cardew, R. E.

The construction of the instrument in one of its most recent forms
is shown in the cut.

On each side of the drum-like case of the instrument are the binding
screws.

These connect with the blocks m and n.

To these the fine wire conductor is connected and is carried down and
up over the two pulleys seen at the lowest extremity, its centre
being attached to c. From c a wire is carried to the drum p, shown
on an enlarged scale on the left of the cut. A second wire from
the same drum or pulley connects to the spring S. The winding of
the two wires is shown in the separate figure of c, where it is
seen that they are screwed fast to the periphery of the little drum,
and are virtually continuations of each other.

By the screw A the tension of the spring S is adjusted.

On the shaft of the little drum p is a pinion, which works into the
teeth of the cog-wheel r.

The shaft of r is extended through the dial of the instrument, and
carries an index. The dial is marked off for volts; g g and h h
are standards for carrying the pulleys.
570 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

The action of the instrument is as follows. The current passing
through the wire heats it.

This current by Ohm's law is proportional to the electro-motive force
between the terminals. As it is heated it expands and as it cools
contracts, definite expanding and contracting corresponding to
definite potential differences. As the wire expands and contracts
the block or pin c moves back and forth, thus turning the drum p and
cogwheel r one way or permitting it to turn the other way under the
pull of the spring S.

Fig. 345.

CARDEW VOLTMETER.

In this construction for a given expansion of the wire the piece c
only moves one half as much.

The advantage of using a wire twice as long as would be required
for the same degree of movement were the full expansion utilized
is that a very thin wire can be employed.

Such a wire heats and cools more readily, and hence the instrument
reaches its reading more quickly or is more deadbeat, if we borrow
a phraseology properly applicable only to instruments with oscillating
indexes.

In the most recent instruments about thirteen feet of wire .0025 inch
in diameter, and made of platinum-silver alloy is used.

571 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

If the potential difference to be measured lies between 30 and 120
volts the wire as described suffices.

But to extend the range of the instrument a resistance in series is
required.

If such resistance is double that of the instrument wire, and remains
double whether the latter is hot or cold the readings on the scale
will correspond to exactly twice the number of volts.

This is brought about in some instruments by the introduction
in series of a duplicate wire, precisely similar to the other wire,
and like it, carried around pulleys and kept stretched by a
spring.

[Transcriber's note: If the series resistance is twice that of the
voltmeter, the indicated voltage will be ONE THIRD of the total
voltage.]

Thus whatever ratio of resistance exists between the two wires cold,
it is always the same at any temperature, as they both increase in
temperature at exactly the same rate.

Tubes are provided to enclose the stretched wires and pulleys, which
tubes are blackened.

The voltmeter is unaffected by magnetic fields, and, as its
self-induction is very slight, it is much used for alternating
currents.

The tubes containing the wire may be three feet long.

Its disadvantages are thus summarized by Ayrton. It absorbs a
good deal of energy; it cannot be constructed for small potential
differences, as the wire cannot be made thicker, as it would make
it more sluggish; there is vagueness in the readings near the zero
point and sometimes inaccuracy in the upper part of the scale.

Volts, Lost.
The volts at the terminals of a dynamo at full load fall short
of their value on open circuit.

The difference of the two values are termed lost volts.

Voltmeter, Electrostatic.

A voltmeter based on the lines of the quadrant electrometer. It
includes two sets of quadrants, each oppositely excited by one of
the two parts, whose potential difference is to be determined.

They attract each other against a controlling force as of gravity.

One form has the two sets poised on horizontal axes, bringing the
parts so that the flat quadrants move in vertical planes.

In another form a number of quadrants are used in each set, the
members of the two sets alternating with each other.

One set is fixed, the others move and carry the index.

Vulcanite.
Vulcanized india rubber which by high proportion of sulphur and
proper vulcanization has been made hard.

It is sometimes distinguished from ebonite as being comparatively
light in color, often a dull red, while ebonite is black. For its
electrical properties see Ebonite.

Both substances have their defects, in producing surface
leakage.
Washing with weak ammonia, or with dilute soda solution, followed
by distilled water, is recommended for the surface, if there is any
trouble with surface leakage.

It may also be rubbed over with melted paraffine wax.

572 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

W.
(a) A symbol or abbreviation for watt.

(b) A symbol or abbreviation for work.

(c) A symbol or abbreviation for weight.

Wall Bracket.
A telegraph bracket to be attached to the external walls of buildings
to which wires are attached as they come from the poles to reach
converters, or for direct introduction into a building.

Wall Sockets.
Sockets for incandescent lamps constructed to be attached to a
wall.

Ward.
Direction in a straight line; a term proposed by Prof.

James Thompson.
The words "backward" and "forward" indicate its scope.

Water.
A compound whose molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one
atom of oxygen; formula, H2 O.

Its specific gravity is 1, it being the base of the system of
specific gravities of solids and liquids.

If pure, it is almost a non-conductor of electricity. If any impurity
is present it still presents an exceedingly high, almost immeasurable
true resistance, but becomes by the presence of any impurity an
electrolyte.

Water Equivalent.
In a calorimeter of any kind the weight of water which would be raised
as much as is the calorimeter with its contents by the addition of
any given amount of heat received by the calorimeter.

Waterproof Lamp Globe.
An outer globe for incandescent lamps, to protect them from water.

Watt.
(a) The practical unit of electric activity, rate of work, or rate
of energy. It is the rate of energy or of work represented by a
current of one ampere urged by one volt electro-motive force; the
volt-ampere.

It is the analogue in electricity of the horse power in mechanics;
approximately, 746 watts represent one electric horse power.

Ohm's law, taken as C = E/R, gives as values for current, C and
E/R, and for electro- motive force C R. In these formulas, C
represents current strength, R represents resistance and E represents
electro-motive force.

Then a watt being the product of electro-motive force by current
strength, we get the following values for rate of electric energy,
of which the watt is the practical unit: (1) E2/R -- (2) C*E -- (3)
C2 * R.

The equivalents of the watt vary a little according to different
authorities. Ayrton gives the following equivalents: 44.25
foot pounds per minute--.7375 foot pounds per second--1/746 horse
power.

These values are practically accurate. Hospitalier gives .7377
foot pounds per second.

Hering gives .737324 foot pounds per second, and 1000/745941 horse
power.

Welding, Electric.

Welding metals by heat produced by electricity. The heat may be produced
by a current passing through the point of junction (Elihu Thomson)
or by the voltaic arc. (Benardos & Olzewski.)

Fig. 346. ELECTRIC WELDING INDUCTION COIL.

The current process is carried out by pressing together the objects
to be united, while holding them in conducting clamps. A heavy
current is turned on by way of the clamps and rapidly heats the
metals at the junction, which is of course the point of highest
resistance.

As the metal softens, it is pressed together, one of the clamps being
mounted with feed motion, flux is dropped on if necessary, and the
metal pieces unite.

The most remarkable results are thus attained; almost all common
metals can be welded, and different metals can be welded
together. Tubes and other shapes can also be united. In many cases
the weld is the strongest part.

575 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

The alternating current is employed. A special dynamo is sometimes
used to produce it.

This dynamo has two windings on the armature. One is of fine wire and
is in series with the field magnets and excites them. The other
is of copper bars, and connects with the welding apparatus, giving
a current of high intensity but actuated by low potential.

Where the special dynamo is not used, an induction coil or transformer
is used.

The primary includes a large number of convolutions of relatively
fine wire; the secondary may only be one turn of a large copper bar.

The cut shows in diagram an electric welding coil.

P is the primary coil of a number of turns of wire; S S is the
secondary, a single copper bar bent into an almost complete circle.
It terminates in clamps D D for holding the bars to be welded. B C,
B' C are the bars to be welded. They are pressed together by the
screw J. The large coil I of iron wire surrounding the coils represents
the iron core.

The real apparatus as at present constructed involves many
modifications.

The diagram only illustrates the principle of the apparatus.

In welding by the voltaic arc the place to be heated is made an
electrode of an arc by connection with one terminal of an electric
circuit.

A carbon is connected to the other terminal.

An arc is started by touching and withdrawal of the carbon. The heat
may be used for welding, soldering, brazing, or even for perforating
or dividing metal sheets.

Welding Transformer.
The induction coil or transformer used in electric welding.

For its general principles of construction, see Welding,
Electric.

Wheatstone's Bridge.
A system of connections applied to parallel circuits, including
resistance coils for the purpose of measuring an unknown resistance.

A single current is made to pass from A through two parallel connected
branches, joining together again at C. A cross connection B D
has a galvanometer or other current indicator in circuit. In any
conductor through which a current is passing, the fall of potential
at given points is proportional to the resistance between such
points.

Referring to the diagram a given fall of potential exists between A
and C.

The fall between A and B is to the fall between A and C as the
resistance r between A and B is to the resistance r + r' between A
and C.

The same applies to the other branch, with the substitution of the
resistances s and S' and the point D for r r' and B.

Therefore, if this proportion holds, r : r' : : s : S'. No current
will go through B D , and the galvanometer will be unaffected.
Assume s' to be of unknown resistance, the above proportion
will give it, if r, r' and s are known, or if the ratio of r to
r' and the absolute value of s is known.
576 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

In use the resistances r, r', and s are made to vary as desired. To
measure an unknown resistance it is introduced at S', and one of
the other resistances is varied until the galvanometer is unaffected.

Then the resistance of S' is determined by calculation as just
explained.

The artificial resistances may be resistance coils, q. v., or it is
enough to have one unknown resistance at s.

Then if the length of wire ABC is accurately known, the point B
can be shifted along it until the balance is attained. The relative
lengths A B, and B C, will then give the ratio r : r' needed for
the calculation.

This assumes the wire ABC to be of absolutely uniform resistance.
This is the principle of the meter-bridge described below.

The use of coils is the more common method and is carried out by
special resistance boxes, with the connections arranged to carry
out the exact principle as explained.

The principle of construction and use of a resistance box of the
Wheatstone bridge type, as shown in the cut, is described under Box
Bridge, q. v.

The next cut shows the sliding form of bridge called the meter
bridge, if the slide wire is a meter long or a half- or a quarter-meter
bridge, etc., according to the length of this wire.

It is described under Meter Bridge, q. v. Many refinements in
construction and in proper proportion of resistances for given
work apply to these constructions.

Whirl, Electric.
(a) A conductor carrying an electric current is surrounded by
circular lines of force, which are sometimes termed an electric
whirl.

(b) The Electric Flyer.

(See Flyer, Electric.)

Wimshurst Electric Machine.
An influence machine for producing high potential or static
electricity.
Two circular discs of thin glass are mounted on perforated hubs or
bosses of wood or ebonite. Each hub has a groove turned upon it to
receive a cord. Each disc is shellacked. They are mounted on a
horizontal steel spindle so as to face and to be within one-eighth
of an inch of each other. On the outside of each disc sixteen or
eighteen sectors of tinfoil or thin metal are cemented.
578 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.
Two curved brass rods terminating in wire brushes curved into a
semi-ellipse just graze the outer surfaces of the plates with their
brushes. They lie in imaginary planes, passing through the axis of
the spindle and at right angles from each other.
Four collecting combs are arranged horizontally on insulating
supports to collect electricity from the horizontal diameters of
the discs. These lie at an angle of about 45° with the other
equalizing rods. Discharging rods connect with the collecting
combs.
The principle of the machine is that one set of sector plates act
as inductors for the other set. Its action is not perfectly
understood.
It works well in damp weather, far surpassing other influence
machines in this respect. On turning the handle a constant succession
or stream of sparks is produced between the terminals of the
discharging rods.

Windage.
In a dynamo the real air gap between the armature windings and pole
pieces is sometimes thus termed.

Wind, Electric.
The rush of air particles from a point connected to a statically
charged condenser.

Winding, Compound.
A method of winding a generator or motor in which a shunt winding
is used for the field magnets and in which also a second winding
of the magnet is placed in series with the outer circuit. (See
Winding, Series--Winding, Shunt.)
Fig. 350. CHARACTERISTIC CURVES OF SHUNT AND SERIES WINDING.
The object of compound winding is to make a self-regulating dynamo
and this object is partly attained for a constant speed.
The characteristic curves of shunt and series winding are of opposite
natures. The first increases in electro-motive force for resistance
in the outer circuit, the latter decreases under the same conditions.
If the windings are so proportioned that these conditions for each
one of the two windings are equal and opposite, it is evident that
the characteristic may be a straight line. This, however, it will
only be at a single speed of rotation.
579 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

Winding, Disc.
A winding which (S. P. Thompson) may be treated as a drum winding
extended radially, the periphery corresponding to the back end of
the drum."You can put it off like this," says Miss Knollys in a low tone. "It
is very simple; but you should think. I have always thought you--you
liked Maurice, but you were a--a friend of his. Save him from this.
Don't let him marry this child."

"I don't think he will marry a child!" says Mrs. Bethune, laughing.

"You mean----"

"I mean nothing at all--nothing, really," says Marian. "But that
baby! My dear Margaret, how impossible!"


CHAPTER VIII.

HOW A STORM RAGED; AND HOW, WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN MET FACE TO FACE,
THE VICTORY--FOR A WONDER--WENT TO THE MAN.


There has been a second scene between Lady Rylton and Sir
Maurice--this time a terrible scene. She had sent for him directly
after dinner, and had almost commanded him to marry Miss Bolton. She
had been very bitter in her anger, and had said strange things of
Marian. Sir Maurice had come off triumphant, certainly, if greatly
injured, and with his heart on fire. He had, at all events, sworn he
would not marry the little Bolton girl. Those perpetual
insinuations! What had his mother meant by saying that Marian was
laying herself out to catch Lord Dunkerton, an old baron in the
neighbourhood, with some money and a damaged reputation? That could
not be true--he would not believe it. That old beast! Marian would
not so much as look at him. And yet--had she not been very civil to
him at that ball last week?

Coming out from his mother's boudoir, a perfect storm of fury in his
heart, he finds himself face to face with Marian. Something in his
face warns her. She would have gone by him with a light word or two,
but, catching her by the wrist, he draws her into a room on his
left.

"You have had another quarrel with your mother," says she
sympathetically, ignoring the anger blazing in his eyes. "About that
silly girl?"

"No. About you!"

His tone is short--almost violent.

"About me?"

She changes colour.

"Yes, you. She accuses you of encouraging that wretched old man,
Dunkerton. Do you _hear?_ Speak! Is it true?"

"This is madness!" says Marian, throwing out her hands. "How _could_
you believe such folly? That old man! Why will you give ear to such
gossip?"

"Put an end to it, then," says he savagely.

"I? How can I put an end to it?"

"By marrying _me!"_

He stands opposite to her, almost compelling her gaze in return.
Mrs. Bethune gives it fearlessly.

"Maurice dearest, you are excited now. Your mother--she is _so_
irritating. I know her. Marriage, as we now stand, would mean quite
dreadful things. Do be reasonable!"

"You talk of reason," says he passionately. "Does love reason? No! I
will hear your last word now."

"Are you condemning me, then, to death?" asks she, smiling
delicately, and laying two large but delicate hands upon his arms.

He shakes her off.

"Answer me. Will you marry me, or will you not?"

"This is too sudden, Maurice!"

A little fire is kindling in her own eyes; she had objected to that
last repulsion.

"Sudden! After all these months!" He pauses. "Is it to be Dunkerton
or me?" asks he violently.

"Please do not bring Lord Dunkerton into this discussion," says she
coldly.

"I certainly shall."

"You mean that I----"

"Have encouraged him. So I hear, at all events, and--there are
things I remember."

"For the matter of that," says she, throwing up her beautiful head,
"there are things I remember too! You--you dare to come here and
accuse _me_ of falsity when I have watched you all day making steady
court to that wretched little plebeian, playing tennis with her all
the day long, and far into the evening! No! I may have said half a
dozen words to Lord Dunkerton, but you--how many half-dozen words
have you said to Miss Bolton? Come, answer me that, as we seem bent
on riddles."

"All this is as nothing," says Rylton. "You know, as well as I do,
that Miss Bolton has not a thought of mine! I want only one thing,
the assurance that you love me, and I put it at marriage. Will you
link your fate with mine, low down though it is at present? If you
will, Marian"--he comes closer to her and lays his hands upon her
shoulders, and gazes at her with eyes full filled with honest
love--"I shall work for you to the last day of my life. If you will
not----"

He pauses--he looks at her--he waits. But no answer comes from her.

"Marian, take courage," says he softly--very softly. "My darling, is
money everything?"

She suddenly leans back from him, and looks fair in his eyes.

"It is, it is," says she hoarsely. "I _can't_ again go through what
I suffered before. Wait, _do_ wait--something--something will
happen----"

"You refuse me?" says he, in a lifeless tone.

"Not that. Don't speak like that. Don't leave me, Maurice."

"It is our last hour," says he deliberately. "Be sure of that. If
money is so much to you--if money counts so far beyond all that a
man can give you of his heart and soul--then take it."

"And you," says she, "are you not seeking money, too? This girl,
this little _fool;_ your mother has led you to think of her. You
will marry her!"

"I will marry you," says he coldly, "if you will marry me."

"I have told you that it is impossible"--she draws a deep
breath--"at present."

"You will not trust me, then, to make a fortune for you?"

"A fortune! It takes so _long_ to make; and," smiling, and drawing
nearer to him, and suddenly flinging her arms around his neck, "are
we not happy as we are?"

"No." He loosens her arms lightly, and, still holding them, looks at
her. How fair she is, how desirable! "Marian," says he hoarsely,
"think! It is indeed my last word. Will you trust yourself to me as
things are, or will you reject me? Marian, say you will marry me as
I now am--poor, ruined."

He holds her, gazing at her despairingly. She would have spoken,
perhaps, but no words come to her; no words to soften her grim
determination. She _will_ not marry him poor--and yet she loves him.

Rylton, with a stifled oath, pushes her from him.

"This is the end," says he.

He goes to the door.

"Maurice!" says she faintly.

He turns.

"Well, will you marry me to-morrow?" asks he mockingly.

"No. But----"

"There is no time for 'buts,'" says he.

He opens the door and closes it sharply behind him.

Mrs. Bethune flings herself back into a chair, and presses her
handkerchief to her face.

"Oh, it is nothing, nothing," says she presently. She gets up, and,
standing before a glass, arranges her hair and presses her eyebrows
into shape. "He gets impatient, that is all. He will never be able
to live without me. As for that absurd child, Maurice would not look
at _her_. No, I am sure of him, quite, quite sure; to-morrow he will
come back to me, repentant."


CHAPTER IX.

HOW MAURICE PLACES HIS LIFE IN THE HANDS OF THE HOYDEN, AND HOW SHE
TELLS HIM MANY THINGS, AND DESIRES MANY THINGS OF HIM.


Maurice had said it was his last word. He goes straight from Marian
Bethune to one of the reception-rooms, called the lesser ballroom,
where some dancing is going on. His face is a little white, but
beyond that he betrays no emotion whatever. He feels even surprised
at himself. Has he lost all feeling? Passing Randal Gower he
whispers a gay word or two to him. He feels in brilliant spirits.

Tita Bolton is dancing, but when her dance comes to an end he goes
to her and asks her for the next. Yes; he can have it. She dances
like a little fairy, and when the waltz is at an end he goes with
her, half mechanically, towards the conservatory at the end of the
room.

His is calm now, quite calm; the chatter of the child has soothed
him. It had been a pleasure to dance with her, to laugh when she
laughed, to listen to her nonsense. As he walks with her towards the
flowers, he tells himself he is not in the least unhappy, though
always quite close to him, at his side, someone seems to be
whispering:

"It is all over! it is all over!"

Well, so much the better. She has fooled him too long.

The conservatory at the end of the lesser ballroom leads on to the
balcony outside, and at the end of that is another and larger
conservatory, connected with the drawing-room. Towards this he would
have led her, but Tita, in the middle of the balcony, stops short.

"But I want to dance," says she.

That far-off house, full of flowers, seems very much removed from
the music.

"You have been playing tennis all day," says Rylton. "You must be
tired. It is bad for you to fatigue yourself so much. You have had
enough dancing for awhile. Come and sit with me. I, too, am tired."

"Well, for awhile," says she reluctantly.

It is with evident regret that she takes every step that leads her
away from the dancing-room.

The larger conservatory is but dimly lit with lamps covered with
pale pink shades. The soft musical tinkling of a fountain, hidden
somewhere amongst the flowering shrubs, adds a delicious sense of
coolness to the air. The delicate perfume of heliotrope mingles with
the breath of the roses, yellow and red and amber, that, standing in
their pots, nod their heads drowsily. The begonias, too, seem half
dead with sleep. The drawing-room beyond is deserted.

"Now, is not this worth a moment's contemplation?" says Rylton,
pressing her gently into a deep lounging chair that seems to swallow
up her little figure. "It has its own charm, hasn't it?"

He has flung himself into another chair beside her, and is beginning
to wonder if he might have a cigarette. He might almost have
believed himself content, but for that hateful monotonous voice at
his ear.

"Oh, it _is_ pretty," says Tita, glancing round her. "It is lovely.
It reminds me of Oakdean."

"Oakdean?"

"My old home," says she softly--"where I lived with my father."

"Ah, tell me something of your life," says Rylton kindly.

No idea of making himself charming to her is in his thoughts. He
has, indeed, but one idea, and that is to encourage her to talk, so
that he himself may enjoy the bliss of silence.

"There is nothing," says she quickly. "It has been a stupid life. I
was very happy at Oakdean, when," hesitating, "papa was alive; but
now I have to live at Rickfort, with Uncle George, and," simply,
"I'm not happy."

"What's the matter with Rickfort?"

"Nothing. It's Uncle George that there is something the matter with.
Rickfort is my house, too, but I hate it; it is so gloomy. I'm
sure," with a shrug of her shoulders, "Uncle George might have it,
and welcome, if only he wouldn't ask _me_ to live there with him."

"Uncle George seems to make a poor show," says Rylton.

"He's horrid!" says Miss Bolton, without reservation. "He's a
_beast!_ He hates me, and I hate him."

"Oh, no!" says Rylton, roused a little.

The child's face is so earnest. He feels a little amused, and
somewhat surprised. She seems the last person in the world capable
of hatred.

"Yes, I do," says she, nodding her delightful little head, "and he
knows it. People say a lot about family resemblances, but it seems
wicked to think Uncle George is papa's brother. For my part,"
recklessly, "I don't believe it."

"Perhaps he's a changeling," says Sir Maurice.

Again, we read of Mauritius, who stood on the promontory of his
island and could sweep over the sea with an optical instrument
to watch the ships of the enemy. This tells us that the telescope
is not a modern invention."
Lord Kingsborough, speaking of the ancient Mexicans, says: "They were
acquainted with many scientific instruments of strange invention,
whether the telescope may not have been of the number is uncertain,
but the thirteenth plate of _Dupaix's Monuments_, part second, which
represents a man holding something of a similar nature to his eye,
affords reason to suppose that they knew how to improve the powers
of vision.

Our first positive knowledge of spectacles is gathered from the
writings of Roger Bacon, who died in 1292.[3] Bacon says: "This
instrument (a plano-convex glass or large segment of a sphere) is
useful to old men and to those who have weak eyes, for they may see
the smallest letters sufficiently magnified."

[Footnote 3: _Med. and Surg. Reporter_.]
Alexander de Spina, who died in 1313, had a pair of spectacles made
for himself by an optician who had the secret of their invention.

De Spina was so much pleased with them that he made the invention
public.

Monsieur Spoon fixes the date of the invention between 1280 and 1311.

In a manuscript written in 1299 by Pissazzo, the author says: "I
find myself so pressed by age that I can neither read nor write
without those glasses they call spectacles, lately invented, to the
great advantage of poor old men when their sight grows weak."

Friar Jordan, who died in Pisa in 1311, says in one of his sermons,
which was published in 1305, that "it is not twenty years since
the art of making spectacles was found out, and is indeed one
of the best and most necessary inventions in the world." In the
fourteenth century spectacles were not uncommon and Italy excelled
in their manufacture.

From Italy the art was carried into Holland, then to Nuremberg,
Germany.

In a church in Florence is a fresco representing St. Jerome (1480).
Among the several things represented is an inkhorn, pair of scissors,
etc.

We also find a pair of spectacles, or _pince-nez_--the glasses are
large and round and framed in bone.

It was not until 1575 that Maurolicus, of Messina, pointed out the
cause of near sightedness and far sightedness and explained how
concave glasses corrected the former and convex glasses the latter
defect.

In the wake of advanced, education stalks the spectacle age. Any one
watching a passing crowd cannot fail but note the great number of
people wearing spectacles.

Unfortunately it is not limited to adults, but our youths of both
sexes go to make up this army of ametropes.

At what age should children first wear glasses?

This is a much debatable question.
I don't want to be married, though, if I did, I should be able
to get rid of Uncle George. But what I should like to do would be to
run away!"

"Where?" asks Rylton, rather abominably, it must be confessed.

"Oh, I don't know," confusedly. "I haven't thought it out."

"Well, _don't,"_ says he kindly.

"That is what everyone would say," impatiently. "In the meantime, I
_cannot go_ on living with my uncle. No; I can't." She leans back,
and, flinging her arms behind her neck, looks with a little laughing
pout at Rylton. "Some day I shall do something dreadful," says she.

She is charming, posing so. Rylton looks at her. How pretty she is!
How guileless! How far removed from worldly considerations! His
affair with Marian is at an end. Never to be renewed! That is
settled. He had given her a last word, and she had spurned it.

After all, why should he _not _marry this charming child? The
marriage would please his mother, and restore the old name to
something of its ancient grandeur. And as for himself--why, it
matters nothing to him.

"It is all over. It is all over."

Again that teasing voice in his ear.

Well, if it _is_ all over, so much to the good. But as for this girl
sitting near him, if he must take her to be his wife, it shall be at
least in good faith. She shall know all. Probably she will refuse
him. For one thing, because he is ten years older than she is--a
century in the eyes of a child of seventeen; and, for another,
because she may not like him at all. For all he knows, she may hate
him as she hates her uncle George, in certain ways.

However it is, he will tell her that he has no love for her. It
shall be all fair and above-board between them. He can give her a
title. She can give him money, without which the title would be
useless.

On the instant he makes up his mind to risk the proposal. In all
probability she will say "No" to it. But if not--if she accepts
him--he swears to himself he will be true to her.

"The most dreadful thing you could do," says he, "would be to marry
a man who did not love you."

"Eh?" says she.

She seems surprised.

"To marry a man, then, with whom you weren't in love!"

"Oh, _that_, that's nothing," says she grandly. "I'd do a great deal
more than _that_ to get away from my uncle. But"--sorrowfully--
"nobody's asked me."

She says it so innocently, so sweetly, that Rylton's heart grows
cold within him. To ask her! To tempt this child----

"But," says he, looking away from her religiously, "would you marry
a man who was not in love with _you?"_

"Not in love with me?"

"No. Not actually in love, but who admired--liked you?"

"But a man who wasn't in love with me wouldn't want to marry me,"
says Tita. "At least, that's what the novels say."

"He might," says Rylton deliberately. He leans forward. "Will you
marry _me?"_

He almost laughs aloud as he makes his extraordinary proposal. If it
fails, as it certainly _must_, he will throw up the remnant of his
life here and go abroad. And, at all events, he can so far satisfy
his mother as to assure her that he had placed his all at this
little heiress's feet.

"You! You!" says she.

She stares at him.

"Even me! You said a moment ago that no man would ask you to marry
him for any reason less than love; but I--I am not in love with you,
and yet I ask you to marry me."

He pauses here, shocked at his own words, his brutal audacity.

"But why?" asks the girl slowly.

She is looking at him, deep inquiry and wonder in her great gray
eyes.

"Because I am poor and you are rich," says he honestly. "Your money
could redeem this old place, and I could give you a title--a small
thing, no doubt."

"You could take me away from my uncle," says the girl thoughtfully.
There is silence for awhile, and then--"I should be able to do as I
liked," says she, as if communing with herself.

"That certainly," says Rylton, who feels as if all things should be
allowed her at this juncture, considering how little it is in his
power to allow.

"And you?" She looks up at him. _"You_ could do as you liked, too!"

"Thank you!" says Rylton.

He smiles in spite of himself, but the girl continues very grave.

"You say you have nothing," says she, "but this house?"

"It is useless arguing about it," returns Rylton; "this house will
go shortly with all the rest. For myself, I don't care much really,
but my mother--she would feel it. That's why I say you can help us,
if you will."

"I should like to help _you!"_ says Tita, still very slowly.

She lays a stress upon the word "you."

"Well, will you trust yourself to me?"

"Trust myself!"

"Will you marry me? Consider how it is. I lay it all before you. I
am not in love with you, and I have not a penny in the world.
Literally, I have nothing."

"You have a mother," says Tita. "I," pathetically, "have nothing."
It is plain to him that she had set great store by her dead father.
"I have nothing, really. But you say this house must go?"

"Not if you will help me to keep it."

"I should not like to live here," says Tita, with some haste. And
then in a low tone, "Your mother would live here?"

"Yes, certainly."

"Well, and I--I have been very unhappy with Uncle George," says she.
Her air is so naïve that Rylton bursts out laughing. After all, the
last thing he would desire either would be to live here with his
mother.

"You would not have to make this place your home," says he. It had
never been a home to him since his father's death. "You shall
command me in this matter; I shall live at Oakdean if that is your
desire." Indeed, it seems to him it would be a great relief to get
away from the Hall, from his mother, from----

"To live at Oakdean!" The girl's face grows transfigured. She stares
at him as if hardly seeing him, however; her thoughts have carried
her back to past delights in which he has had no part. "To live
there again!" She sighs quickly, excitedly. "You haven't seen it,
you don't _know,"_ says she. "But it is the most beautiful place on
earth." She puts out her hand and lays it on his. "If I marry you,
will you promise that I shall live at Oakdean?"

"If you will do me the honour to marry me, you shall live just where
you like," returns he. Indeed, to him it is now a matter of
indifference where life may be dragged out to its weary end. But
Tita fails to see the apathy in his manner.

"Then, it is settled," cries she joyfully. She clasps her hands.
"Oh, how _good_ of you!" says she. "What a blessing I came here!
Fancy getting rid of Uncle George and getting back to Oakdean all in
one stroke!" Suddenly she looks round at him; there is almost terror
in her gaze. "You are sure you _mean_ it?" says she.

"I mean it. But, Tita,"--he takes one of her hands and holds it
between his own, and regards her with some anxiety--"have you
thought it all out? I have told you the truth, you know. I have told
you that I am not in love with you."

"In love with me! I'm sure I hope not," says Tita with a disgusted
air. "Don't put yourself out about that. In Nobili's pile the metals

"Never mind, I know," says Tita. "I feel things. They come to me. I
don't blame her. I'm sure I'm often horrid. I know that, when I look
at other people. When I look at----"

She pauses.

"Look at whom?"

"At your cousin."

"My cousin!"

"Yes! You love her, don't you?"

"Love her!" He has turned suddenly as pale as death. "What do you
mean?" asks he in a low voice.

"I love her, any way," says Tita. "I think Miss Knollys is the
nicest person in all the world."

"Oh, Margaret?" says he. He says it involuntarily. The relief is so
great that it compels him to give himself away.

"Why, who else?" says Tita. "Who did _you_ think I meant?"

"Who _could_ I think?" says he, recovering. "Even now I am
surprised. Margaret, though very superior in most ways, is not
always beloved."

"But you love her?"

"Oh yes, _I_ do!"

"I am glad of that," says Tita. "Because I love her more than anyone
I know. And I have been thinking"--she looks at him quickly--"I have
been thinking that"--nervously--"that when I marry you, Miss Knollys
will be my cousin, too, in a sort of way, and that perhaps she will
let me call her by her name. Do you," anxiously, "think she will?"

"I know she will." His answer is terse. He has barely yet recovered
from the shock she had innocently given him.

"And your mother?" asks she, going back to the first question. "Do
you think she will like you to marry me? Oh, do persuade her!"

"Make no mistake about my mother, Tita; she will receive you with
open arms." He feels as if he were lying when he says this, yet is
it not the truth? "She will be glad to receive you as a daughter."

"Will she? She doesn't look like it," says Tita, "not sometimes
when I--_look back at her!"_

She rises, and makes a step towards the door of the conservatory
that will lead her to the balcony, and so back to the dancing-room.

"Tita? Bear with my mother," says he gently, and in a low voice.

The girl turns to him, her whole young, generous heart in her voice.
"Oh, I shall! I shall indeed!"

They traverse the long balcony in silence. The moon is flooding it
with brilliant light. Here and there are groups in twos or
threes--the twos are most popular. Just as they come to the entrance
to the dancing-room, an alcove now deserted, Tita stops short and
looks at him.

"You have promised to be kind to me!" says she, her voice trembling.
For the first time the solemnity of this marriage arrangement of
hers seems to have dawned upon her.

"I have," says Rylton earnestly.

"I am often very troublesome," says the poor child. "Uncle George
says so. But you----" She hesitates, looking at him always. Her gaze
is intense. He feels as if she is watching him, taking his mental
temperature, as it were.

"Be kind to me in turn, Tita," says he. "Don't mistrust me. Try to
_know_ that I like you."

"I wish," says she, a little forlornly, "that you could be fond of
me. I'm--you don't know it--nobody knows it--but I'm often very
lonely. I've been lonely all the time since pappy died."

"You shall never be lonely again," says Rylton. "I'm your friend
from this hour--your friend for ever." He is touched to his very
heart by her words and her small face. He stoops over her, and in
spite of all that has been said against kissing, presses his lips to
her soft cheek!

"Ah! You are kind. I _do_ like you," says she, gazing at him with
earnest eyes. "Yes, I know I shall be happy with you." She is
evidently comparing him most favourably with Uncle George. "And you
will be fond of me, won't you? You will be good to me?"

"I will, so help me God!" says Rylton very solemnly.

To her it seems an oath of allegiance--kindly, tender, reassuring.
To him it is a solemn abjuration of all his devotion to--the other.


CHAPTER X.

HOW MAURICE GIVES WAY TO TEMPER, AND HOW LADY RYLTON PLANTS A SHAFT
OR TWO. AND HOW MARGARET SAYS A WORD IN SEASON, AND HOW IN RETURN
COLONEL NEILSON SAYS A WORD TO HER.


Maurice goes straight to his mother's room, not from a sense of
duty, but a desire to clinch the matter finally. Lady Rylton would
be the last person to permit backsliding where her own interests
were concerned, and perhaps---- He does not exactly say it to
himself in so many words, but he feels a certain dread of the moment
when he shall be alone--a prey to thought. What if he should regret
the move he had taken, to the extent of wanting it undone? His step
grows quicker as he approaches his mother's room. His interview with
her is of the slightest--a bare declaration of the fact. She would
have fallen upon his neck in the exuberance of her triumph and her
satisfaction, but he coldly repulses her.

"My dear mother, why such enthusiasm over my engagement to a girl of
whom you distinctly disapprove?"

"Disapprove! Of Tita! Dearest Maurice, what an idea!"

"We won't go into it," says Maurice, with a gesture of
ill-suppressed disgust. "I know your opinion of her. I beg to say,
however, I do not share it. Badly as I shall come out of this
transaction, I should like you to remember that I both admire and
like Miss Bolton."

"I know, dearest boy, I know," says Lady Rylton, in the tone one
would use to an acute sufferer. "It is very noble of you, Maurice.
It is a sacrifice. I felt sometimes I had no right to demand----"

"The sacrifice is hers," says he shortly, gloomily.

His eyes are bent upon the ground.

"Hers! That little upst---- that poor unsophisticated child! My dear
Maurice, why run away with things? Of course she was charmed,
enchanted, _flattered_, in that you admired her so much as to ask
her to be your wife."

"She was not," says Maurice flatly.

"Exactly what I should have expected from such a----" Lady Rylton
checks herself in her fury. "From such an innocent creature,"
substitutes she. "But for all that, I shall consider how great is
the sacrifice you have made, Maurice--how you have given up the
happiness of your life to preserve the old name."

"I am beginning to get tired of the old name," says Maurice slowly.
"Its nobility seems to me to be on the decline."

"Oh, not now," says Lady Rylton, who does not understand him, who
could not, if she tried, fathom the depths of self-contempt that he
endures, when he thinks of this evening's work, of his permitting
this child to marry him, and give him her wealth--for
nothing--nothing! What _can_ he give her in return? An old name. She
had not seemed to care for that--to know the importance of it. "Now
it will rise again, and at all events, Maurice, you have saved the
old home!"

"True!" says he. "For you."

"For _me?_ Oh, dearest boy, what _can_ you mean?"

"Yes, for you only. She refuses to live here with you."

The very disquietude of his soul has driven him into this mad
avowal. Looking at her with dull eyes and lowering brows, he tells
himself--in this, one of the saddest hours of his life--that he
hates the mother who bore him. Her delight in his engagement is
odious to him; it seems to fan his rage against her. What has she
ever done for him, what sympathy has she ever shown? She has
embittered the life of the woman he loves; she has insulted the
woman he is to marry. What consideration does she deserve at his
hands?

"She refuses to live here with _me?"_ says Lady Rylton. "And why,
may I ask?"

Her small, pale face flushes angrily.

"I don't know, really; you should be the one to know."

His tone is so cold, so uncompromising, that she decides on coming
to terms for the present. Afterwards, when that girl has married
him, she will remember to some purpose, so far as _she_ is
concerned. There is a little tale that she can tell her.

"Dearest Maurice, how could I? I always fancied I treated her with
the utmost kindness. But why should we worry about it? No doubt it
was a mere girlish fancy, a distaste," playfully, "to the terrible
mamma-in-law of fiction. Such monsters do not exist now. She will
learn that by degrees. You will bring her to stay with me for awhile
on your return from your honeymoon?"

"If you desire it."

"Of course I shall desire it; then she and I will become great
friends. You are going? My love to your little _fiancée_, and say I
am so charmed, so delighted! And tell her I should like her to come
to me for a quiet little talk in the morning about eleven; I shall
have no one with me then but Marian."

"She shall not come to you, then," says Rylton. A dark red mounts to
his brow. What a diabolical thought--to receive those two together!
"Do you _hear?"_ says he imperiously.

"Good heavens, yes!" says his mother, pretending prettily to cower
before him. "What a tone! What a look! What have I done, then?"

"What devilish cruelty is in your heart I don't know," says he, his
passion carrying him beyond all bounds; "but understand at once, I
will not have Tita tortured."

Lady Rylton leans back in her chair and laughs.

"You would have made a good tragic actor," she says. "If this little
plebeian throws you over after all, you should think of it. You
remind me of your father when he was in his most amusing moods.
There, go; kiss Tita for me." Rylton turns to the door, his very
soul on fire with rage. Just as he goes out, she calls to him, with
a little soft musical ripple of laughter. "By-the-bye, take care you
do not kiss Marian instead," says she.


  *  *  *  *  * *


He meets Margaret on his way downstairs. He had walked up and down
the passages above, in the dim light, with a view to bringing
himself back into a state of control, with so much success that,
when he comes face to face with Miss Knollys, he seems to her as
self-possessed as usual. He had seen her talking to Tita in the hall
below, in a somewhat earnest manner, and had taken it for granted
that Tita had told her of their engagement.

"Well," says he, stopping her.

"Well?" returns she, smiling.

"You have heard?"

"Of what? Anything new?" curiously. The very best women are curious.

"Of my engagement; surely she has told you?"

"She? Who? _Marian!"_

"No--_no!"_

Then the truth comes to her.

"Tita?" she says faintly.

He nods his head; words fail him.

"She told me nothing," says Margaret, recovering herself.

"Yet I saw you talking together just now."

"You did indeed."

"And she said nothing?"

"Nothing."

"Then what _were_ you talking about?"

"I was advising her to marry no man who did not love her."

"What an extraordinary piece of advice to give to a girl who, as far
as you knew, was not going to be married at all! What led up to it?"

"Not Tita, certainly. It was I who led up to it."

"And why?"

"Do you think I have been blind and deaf, Maurice, during the past
fortnight?" Miss Knollys almost compels his gaze. "If you are going
to marry this young girl, _this child,_ I hope, I"--almost
passionately--_"hope_ it will be for her good and yours."

"Margaret! What a tone! You mean something!"

"I do." Margaret's strong face lights up with honest anxiety. "I
mean this!" She takes a step nearer him. "How is it between you and
Marian?"

"Why, how has it been?" asks he, with affected lightness; but a
change passes over his face.

"Oh, Maurice, take care!" says his cousin, laying her hand upon his
arm.

"Well, if you must have it," says he, frowning, "all that is over."

He breaks away from her, frowning still.

It is quite plain to her that she has offended him. But even as he
leaves her he looks back; a sort of grim smile illumines his face.

"I note that in your 'hoping' you have put Miss Bolton before me;
that is as it should be. She is a sworn admirer of yours. Did you
know it?"

"No. But she appeals to me--I don't know why--but I feel that I
could love her," says Margaret, in short sentences as if thinking,
and as if a little surprised at herself. Suddenly she breaks into a
more immediate feeling. "Oh, Maurice, love her too! Try, _try_ to
love her; she is so young. Her very _soul_ is in your keeping. Be
good to her; she is a mere baby. If you neglect her, forget her----"

Maurice casts a queer look at her.

"'Is thy servant a dog?'" quotes he.


  *  *  *  *  *


Margaret moves slowly away. She had, when Maurice met her, been bent
on going upstairs to her books and her thoughts; but now she turns
backward. She feels as if she wants something. Perhaps she finds
it--unconsciously, however--when she stops before a tall,
soldierly-looking man, who, seeing her, comes to meet her with
evident pleasure.

"You look disturbed!" says Colonel Neilson.

He is, as I have said, a tall man, with a kindly face, and deep eyes
of a dark colour. There is nothing very special about him; he is
not, strictly speaking, handsome, yet he was, last season, one of
the most popular men in town.

"Yes, and no," says Margaret. "My cousin has confided a sort of
secret to me."

"A secret! I may not hear it, then?"

"Well, I don't know. It is, as I have hinted, a _sort_ of secret,
not very much to be kept."

"I may hear it, then?"

"I suppose so. At all events," with a laugh, soft and silk, "I
should like you to hear it, because I want your opinion. You will
give it?"

"You know I will give you everything I have," says he.

"Oh no! you must not talk like that," says she. "Put all that on one
side, and let me have you for my friend. I want one now--not for
myself, but for another; for two others, in fact. You know how fond
I am of Maurice, and lately I have contracted quite a romantic, for
_me"_--she pauses and laughs--"well, quite a romantic affection, for
a little girl staying here with my aunt. You know who I mean--Tita
Bolton."

"A charming child?"

"I am so glad you like her! But, as you say, she is a mere child;
and Maurice has proposed to her, and she has accepted him, and I am
curious about her future."

"Hers only?"

"Oh no! His, too!"

"It will be a risk, certainly," says Colonel Neilson. "I thought--I
imagined--I had heard that Rylton was engaged to his cousin, Mrs.
Bethune--a very beautiful woman."

"How can you think so!" says Margaret. "Well, yes, no doubt she _is_
beautiful, but I should not like Maurice to marry her."

"You would prefer his marrying the 'charming child'?"

"I don't know what I prefer," says Miss Knollys. She casts a
reproachful glance at him that certainly is not deserved. Has he not
served her late and early for the past six years? "I thought you
would help me!"

"You know I shall do that, however things may turn."

"Well, help me here. What _ought_ Maurice to do? I am so dreadfully
unhappy about this projected marriage of his."

"It seems to me you are unhappy about all things except those that
concern yourself. Your own future seems a blank to you; is it not
so?"

Miss Knollys makes a little movement.

"Why should it be always a blank?" says he. "Margaret," in a low
tone, "let me fill it!"

Margaret rises impatiently.

"After all, you can't help me," says she, turning abruptly away.

"Margaret, hear me!"

"No, no, no! What is the use?"

She goes slowly down the hall.


CHAPTER XI.

HOW THE LAST DAY COMES, AND HOW SOME STRANGE WORDS ARE SAID BEFORE
THE MARRIAGE IS ACCOMPLISHED; AND HOW MARION BETHUNE SCORES A POINT.


The dawn of the wedding-day has broken. Everything has been hurried
over as much as possible; with no unseemly haste--just in the most
ordinary, kindly way--however. But Lady Rylton's hand was at the
helm, and she guided her barque to a safe anchor with all speed. She
had kept Tita with her--under her eye, as it were--until the final
accomplishment should have taken place.

The wedding, she declared, should be from her house, from The Place,
seeing that the poor darling child was motherless! She made herself
all things to Tita in those days, although great anger stung her
within. She had been bitterly incensed by Maurice's avowal that Tita
had declined to live with her at The Place, but she had been
mightily pleased, for all that, in the thought that therefore The
Place would be left to her without a division of authority.

Sir Maurice has gone to Rickfort to interview "Uncle George" of
unpleasant fame. He had found him a rather strange-looking man, but
not so impossible as Tita had led him to imagine. He made no
objection of any sort to the marriage, and, indeed, through his cold
exterior Maurice could see that the merchant blood in him was
flattered at his niece's alliance with some of the oldest blood in
England.

He was quite reasonable, too, about his niece's fortune. So much was
to go to redeeming the more immediate debts on the property; for the
rest, Sir Maurice declared he would have nothing to do with it. The
money should be settled on his wife entirely. It was hers; he had no
claim to it. He would have something off his own property, a small
thing, but sufficient for his requirements. He gave his word to quit
the turf finally. He had no desire to amuse himself in that sort of
way again--or, indeed, in other ways. He wished to settle down, etc.
It occurred to old Bolton, who was a shrewd man, that Sir Maurice
looked like one whose interest in life and its joys was at an end.
Still, he was a baronet, and of very ancient lineage, and it was a
triumph for the Boltons. He refused to acknowledge to _himself_ that
he was sacrificing his niece. It was not a sacrifice; it was an
honour!

For one thing the old man stipulated, or rather bargained. He had
managed his niece's affairs so far with great success; some of her
money was in land, in Oakdean and Rickfort, for example; the rest he
had invested securely, as he hoped and believed. If he might still
be acknowledged as her guardian?

Sir Maurice, of course, gave in. Thoroughly ashamed and humiliated
by the whole affair--he, the man, without a penny; she, the woman,
possessed of all things in that line--it gave him genuine relief to
tell her uncle that he would be actually thankful if he would still
continue to be the head of her affairs, and manage her money
matters, as he had managed them hitherto--and always with such happy
results.

Mr. Bolton had bowed to him over his spectacles; his curious gray
eyes caught a little addition of light, as it were. He was honoured
by Sir Maurice's confidence, but, if he might suggest it, he thought
that whilst Sir Maurice's affairs were righting themselves, he ought
to allow himself a certain income out of his wife's money.

But Rylton would not hear of it. He had, as he had already told Mr.
Bolton, a small yearly income that he might with honesty call his
own. It was specially small on account of his mother's jointure
having to be paid out of the estate also. Of course he could not
curtail that, nor would he desire to do so. And, seeing how deeply
dipped the estates were, he could, of course, only take as much as
he could reasonably desire. With his future wife's help, however, he
felt the old property could be brought back in time to its former
splendid position--to a position that he would be proud to see her
the mistress of, etc.

There is always a good deal of humbug talked on these occasions.
Maurice, perhaps, talked very considerably less than most people;
and, indeed, when he said he would gladly see her mistress of all he
ought to have, he spoke something very near the truth. He was
grateful to her beyond all words, and he had sworn to himself to be
loyal to her.

Lady Rylton was distinctly annoyed when she heard of the
arrangements come to. She would have liked Maurice to have had
entire control of his wife's fortune. And, oddly enough, Tita was
annoyed too.

"Oh, I _wish_ you had broken away entirely from Uncle George," she
had said to Maurice, when he had come down on one of his flying
visits to The Place between his engagement and his marriage.

"But why? He seemed to me quite a nice old gentleman."

She could not explain why, however, but only clung to her belief
that they would be better without Uncle George. She hated him. That
seemed to be the sum total of her objection.

Maurice had left The Place the morning after his engagement. He had
had time to have an interview with his little _fiancée_, who seemed
surprised that he wanted it in private, and who, to his great
relief, insisted on making very cool adieux to him in the public
hall, where everyone was passing to and fro, and where Mr. Gower was
making a nuisance of himself by playing ball against the library
door. Naturally it was impossible to have an affecting parting
there.

Marian had not come down to breakfast. And Sir Maurice was conscious
of a passionate sense of relief. She had heard. He knew--he felt
that! His mother would not spare her; and even if she had not cared
as _he_ had cared, still, unless she was the greatest fiend on
earth, she must have had some small love for him--how _terribly_
small he knows! He assures himself of that all day long in the
living torture he is enduring, as if by it he can reconcile himself
to his marriage with this child, whose money is so hateful, and
whose presence is such a bore.

There are a few things, however, always to be thankful for. Tita, in
the frankest fashion in all their interviews, has told him that she
doesn't care a fig about him, that she was marrying him _only_ to
escape from Uncle George!

All their interviews have been but few. Sir Maurice had run down
from here, and there, and everywhere, just for a night at a time,
arriving barely in time for dinner, and going away before breakfast.
Once, and once only, he had seen Mrs. Bethune. Those other times she
had been confined to her room with neuralgia (what should we all do
without neuralgia?), or with letters to write, or something,
_any_thing else.

That one time she came out of the library at the very moment he had
arrived. They met in the hall, and it was quite impossible to avoid
seeing him. She came forward with a charming air.

"Is it you? How long since we have met!" said she. Her tone was
evenness itself; she was smiling brightly. If she was pale, he could
not see it in the darkening twilight. "How troublesome these
elections are! I see you have been staying with the Montgomerys; I
do hope he will get in. But Conservatives are nowhere nowadays.
Truth lies buried in a well. That's a good old saying." She nodded
to him and went up a step or two of the stairs, then looked back.
"Don't stay away from The Place on my account," said she, with
rather an amused smile. "I like to have you here. And see how badly
you are behaving to the beloved one!"

She smiled again, with even more amusement than before, and
continued her graceful way up the stairs. He had turned away sore at
heart. She had not even thought it worth her while to make an appeal
to him. If she had! He told himself that even then, if she had said
but one word, he would have thrown up everything, even his _honour_,
and gone with her to the ends of the earth. But she had not said
that word--she had not cared--_sufficiently_.


* * * *


And now it is indeed all over! They have come back from the
church--Tita just as she is every day, without a cloud on her brow,
and laughing with everybody, and telling everybody, without the
least disguisement, that she is so _glad_ she is married, because
now Uncle George can never claim her again. She seems to have no
thought but this. She treats her newly-made husband in a merry,
perfectly unembarrassed, rather _boyish_ style, and is, in effect,
quite delighted with her new move.

Sir Maurice has gone through it all without a flaw. At the breakfast
he had made quite a finished little speech (he could never have told
you afterwards what it was about), and when the bride was upstairs
changing her wedding garments he had gone about amongst his guests
with an air that left nothing to be desired. He looks quite an ideal
bridegroom. A mad longing for solitude drags him presently, however,
into a small anteroom, opening off a larger room beyond. The
carriage that is to convey him to the station is at the door, and he
almost swears at the delay that arises from Tita's non-appearance.

Yet here--here is rest. Here there is no one to breathe detestable
congratulations into his ear--_no_ one.

A tall, slight figure rises from a couch that is half hidden by a
Chinese screen. She comes forward a step or two. Her face is pale.
It is Marian Bethune.

"You!" says she in a low, strange voice. "Have _you _come here, too,
to _think?"_ She speaks with difficulty. Then all at once she makes
a stray movement with her hands, and brings herself to her senses by
a passionate effort. "You are like me, you want quiet," says she,
with a very ordinary little laugh; "so you came here. Well, shall I
leave you?"

She is looking very beautiful. Her pallor, the violet shades beneath
her eyes, all tend to make her lovely.

"It is you who have left me."

"I? Oh no! Oh, think!" says she, laughing still.

Rylton draws a long breath.

"After all, it could never have come to anything," says he, in a
dull sort of way.

"Never, never," smiling.

"I don't believe you care," says he bitterly.

She looks at him. It is a curious look.

"Why should I? Do _you_ care?"

He turns away.

"Don't let us part bad friends," says she, going to him, and twining
one of her hands round his arm. "What have I done to you, or you to
me? How have we been enemies? It is fate, it is poverty that has
been our common enemy, Maurice, remember what we _have_ been to each
other."

"It is what I dare not remember," says he hoarsely.

His face is resolutely turned from hers.

"Well, well, forget, then, _if you can_. As for me, remembrance will
be my sole joy."

"It is madness, Marian, to talk to me like this. What is to be
gained by it?"

"Why, nothing, nothing, and so let us forget; let us begin again as
true friends only."

"There is no hope of that," says he.

His voice is a mere whisper.

"Oh yes, there is--there," eagerly, _"must_ be. What! Would you
throw me over altogether, Maurice? Oh, that I _could_ not bear! Why
should we not be as brother and sister to each other? Yes, yes,"
vehemently; "tell me it shall be so. You will ask me to your new
house, Maurice, won't you?"

She is looking up into his face, her hand still pressing his arm.

"My wife's house."

"Your wife's house is yours, is it not? You owe yourself something
from this marriage. You will ask me there now and then?"

"She will ask her own guests, I suppose."

"She will ask whom _you_ choose. Pah! what is she but a child in
your hands?"

"Tita is not the cipher you describe her," says Rylton coldly.

"No, no; I spoke wrongly--I am always wrong, it seems to me," says
she, with such sweet contrition that she disarms him again. "I
cannot live if I cannot see you sometimes, and, besides, you _know_
what my life is here, and how few are the houses I can go to,
and"--she slips her arms suddenly round his neck--"you _will_ ask me
sometimes, Maurice?"

"Yes."

"You promise that?"

"I promise that, as far as it lies in my power, I will always
befriend you."

"Ah, that is not enough," says she, laughing and sobbing in the same
breath. "I am losing you for ever. Give me something to dwell upon,
to hope for. Swear you will make me your guest sometimes."

"I swear it," says he huskily.

He removes her arms from his neck, and holds her from him. His face
is gray.

"It is for the sake of our old _friendship_ that I plead," says she.

The tears are running down her cheeks.

"Our friendship," repeats he, with a groan.

He makes a movement as if to fling her from him, then suddenly
catches her to his heart, and presses his lips passionately to hers.


  *  *  *  *  *


"Maurice! Maurice!" calls somebody.

Marian sinks upon a couch near her, and buries her face in her
hands. Sir Maurice goes into the hall to meet his bride.

The partings are very brief. Tita, who is in the gayest spirits,
says good-bye to everybody with a light heart. Has not her freedom
been accomplished? She receives Lady Rylton's effusive embrace
calmly. There are some, indeed, who say that the little bride did
not return her kiss. Just at the very last, with her foot almost on
the carriage step, Tita looks back, and seeing Margaret at a little
distance, runs to her, and flings herself into her embrace.

"You are mine now, my own cousin!" whispers she joyfully.

"God bless you, Tita," says Margaret in a whisper, too, but very
earnestly, "and preserve to you your happy heart!"

"Oh, I shall always be happy," says Tita; "and I shall hurry back to
see _you,"_ giving her another hug.

Then somebody puts her into the carriage, and, still smiling and
waving her hands, she is driven away.

"Really, Margaret, you should be flattered," says Lady Rylton, with
a sneer. "She seems to think more of you than of her husband."

"I hope her husband will think of her," returns Margaret coldly. "As
I told you before, I consider this marriage ill done."


CHAPTER XII.

HOW TITA COMES BACK FROM HER HONEYMOON, AND HOW HER HUSBAND'S MOTHER
TELLS HER OF CERTAIN THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT UNTOLD.


"And the weather--the weather was the most marvellous thing!" says
Tita, with enthusiasm. "Perpetual sunshine! Here, in September, it
often pelts rain all day long!"

_ "Pelts!_ My dear Tita, _what_ a word!" says Lady Rylton.

She sinks back in her chair as if overcome, and presses her perfumed
handkerchief to her face.

"What's the matter with it?" asks Tita, a little smartly, perhaps.
"It's a right-down good word, in my opinion. I've heard lots of
people use it."

"No doubt _you_ have," says her mother-in-law.

"Well, so have you, I dare say!" says Tita.

"I expect we all have," says Margaret Knollys, laughing. "Still, you
know, Tita, it's not a pretty word."

"Very good; I shan't say it again," says Tita, the mutinous little
face of a moment ago now lovely with love.

She has come back from her honeymoon quite as fond of Margaret as
when she started.

It is now the middle of September; outside on the lawn the shadows
are wandering merrily from tree to tree. The sun is high, but little
clouds running across it now and again speak of sharp rains to come.

    "The air so soft, the pines whispering so low,
    The dragon-flies, like fairy spears of steel,
    Darting or poised."

All these speak of the glad heat that still remains, though summer
itself is but a dream that is gone.

Tita's honeymoon is at an end. It had seemed to her delightful. She
had taken but a child's view of it. Maurice had been so kind, so
good, so different from that nasty old uncle. He had been so good,
indeed, that when he asked her to come first to see his mother (Lady
Rylton had made quite a point of this in her letters to him; the
county might think it so odd if the young wife did not appear
anxious to fly into her arms on her return), she had said "Yes"
quite willingly, and with a grateful little glance. He had done so
much for her, she must do something for him. But she hated going
back to The Place, for all that. She wanted to go straight to her
own old home, her beautiful Oakdean, without a single stop.

She has been at The Place now for a week. Margaret Knollys and
Randal Gower are the only two guests, Mrs. Bethune being on a visit
to some friends in Scotland. The shooting here is excellent, and Sir
Maurice has enjoyed himself immensely. Sir Maurice's wife has,
perhaps, not enjoyed herself quite so much. But nothing, so far, has
occurred to render her in the very least unhappy. If the clouds be
black, she has not seen them. Her young soul has uplifted itself,
and is soaring gaily amongst the stars. In her ignorance she tells
herself she is quite, quite happy; it is only when we love that we
doubt of happiness, and thus sometimes (because of our modesty,
perhaps) we gain it. Tita has never known what love means.

There has been a little fret, a little jar to-day, between her and
Lady Rylton. The latter's memory is good, and she has never
forgotten what Maurice--in a moment's folly--had said of Tita's
determination not to live with her at The Place. It is Lady Rylton's
_rôle_ to return to all, in extra good measure, such injuries as she
may judge herself to have received.

Tita naturally, in this small warfare, is at a disadvantage. She has
forgotten her words, but even if she remembered them, would not for
a moment suspect Maurice of having repeated them. as[ Footnote

standpoint is assured. Without anticipating, however, let me state
that the first thing which impressed me about compressed air was its
extraordinary effect upon cerebral and cerebro-spinal York_Medical

on" my, published report of this case, that most accomplished
writer and physician, Henry M.

    Lyman--than whom thither is
    no greater authority on

be followed by educators in this country.

Dr.

Carter, He in the leading paper on this subject, makes the pregnant
remark:" If the hope is of building up a science of education, their
school life liable to be attacked by the disease shortly me on

Hence, those who work in caissons, or submerged tunnels, under an

With an apology for this brief the vein alone. finding digression,
I now return to the interesting case which or has honeycombed the
constitution?

These few preliminary remarks are_apropos_ to what is to in the
subject which I has given rise to it.

the operation.

A child at The reason for this is cerebro-spinal canal, there is
this way.

And this brings us nation a of vital importance. to the second fact,
which requires no special elaboration, and may be stated thus:_Second
Fact.

_--The duration of the effect of a remedy the cerebro-spinal
axis is in the inverse ratio of its volatility; and this is equally
true whether the remedy be given with or without the precautions
previously detailed.

For example, the anæsthetic effects of ether disappear shortly after
removal of the inhaler, whether we apply tourniquets to the The

and probably of all remedies possessing a chemical affinity for

arises that here are things which contain the germ of some,, or

the analgesic influence from gymnastic exercise and 10.25 per cent.
of the total present number wear eye condensation.

To express this truth mathematically have is not difficult.

Thus, when a represents the amount of blood of the whole body,_b_
the amount of the remedy,_e_ the amount of atmospheric compression,
and_x_ of reasoning which, at this stage.]

Prof.

Pfluger attributes this large amount of that light is essential
to the development of the first and most important sense. Again, the

which has been within historic co-operation educational workers
must continue to flounder in the morasses shall so have the simple
formula: b x e. x=----- a, A definite conception of the truth of
this proposition will, I think, be more readily attained by the her
presentation of the steps which led me to its discovery.

Let me begin, then, by stating that my attention was attracted
several years ago by that unique complex of symptoms known as the"
caisson or tunnel disease." are As most physicians are aware, the
caisson disease is good detested an affection were both too numerous
and too constant to be amenable to such an explanation, are caisson,
or in other words, while he remains under pressure.

Moreover, when the the young mother with her first child,, her and
an over stimulus perverts the action of those compartment.
The result is that by this over-stimulation the seeds grand of
future trouble are sown.

Let the adult gaze upon the arc of an transition from the condensed
atmosphere to that of ordinary is the respiratory and cardiac centers
contained in medulla. This may be done by Dr.

F.W. Ring, assistant surgeon to the Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital,
declared that both the amount of ether and the time consumed in
its administration were infinitesimal when compared with what had
been expended in previous efforts at inducing anæsthesia in the
usual way and as in the case of a certain individual I have in mind,
there may be a permanent loss of sight.

Parents should take system, as exhibited in a large number of persons.
The results of these studies I now submit without hesitation, and
in all candor, to the judgment of the profession,, as I certainly
function entering the compressed air employed in the construction
of the Hudson River tunnel, were in the habit of drinking a quantity
of alcohol, in the form of whisky.

So long as these men remained outside the tunnel, where the atmospheric
conditions were normal, they were not visibly by their potations.

Those performs daily?

The brain developing so quickly wills with an increasing rapidity
the eye to do increasing duties; note the result--a tendency to
impoverished first, and the eye are more or less exhilarated, and,
in short, behave as though under the influence of a stimulant. Hardly
had I observed these things, which are perfectly well known to those
who have been able to familiarize themselves with the ordinary who
remain for a certain length of time, not too long, however, in the
condensed atmosphere, exhibit a most striking exacerbation of mental
and physical vigor.

They go up and down ladders, heavy weights,, we should turn our
attention to home surroundings of our little ones. The overheated
rooms believe that such bodies nourished in almost pestilential
atmosphere can nourish such delicate organs of vision, and keep
them ready for the enormous amount of work each little eye effects
of compressed air as used in caissons and submarine works of various
kinds, when my attention become attracted by what at first appeared
to be a phenomenon of trivial importance.

In a word, I observed that some of the men exposed to the effects
of the compressed air were more exhilarated by it than others.
Upon superficial reflection one might have supposed that this
discrepancy seventy or eighty per cent., and, crowning all, was
the Heidelberg Gymnasium,. with 100 per cent. the short sighted,
in physiological was to be accounted for merely on the basis of
constitutional idiosyncrasy; maturer thought, however, convinced
me that.

This led me to amount of blood sequestrated by the ligatures,_b_
the amount of the remedy,_c_ bad sight to insufficient lighting of
school rooms, badly printed books, etc.

One must agree with a certain writer, who says:" Schools are absolute
manufactories startling statement made by Prof.

Pfluger, that of 45,000 children examined in more than one-half
were suffering from defective eyesight study the habits of the
men; and thus it was that I arrived at a discovery of real practical
value to neurotherapy.

To be brief, I found that a certain percentage of the men, before.

When, however, they entered the air of the tunnel, but a short time
elapsed before they became exhilarated to an inordinate degree,
acting, as one of the foremen graphically expressed it,"
as though they owned the town."

On the other hand, of alcohol was withheld from them, these same men
were no more, if as much, exhilarated on entering the compressed
air as were their fellows. The effects of beverage, then, are
enhanced them by exposing the subject to the influence Tita of an
atmosphere condensed to a considerable degree beyond that, vermouth,
champagne, and other stimulants, before exposing the subject to the
influence of the Schools," has many valuable hints which after
leaving the tunnel.

The seizure never is, however, occurs while the subject is in the
condensed atmosphere complexion----, and invariably observed analogous
effects, i.e., palpable augmentation not far to seek.

When we compress the veins alone there is a rapid
accumulation of blood in the extremities through the accessions
derived from the uninterrupted arteries.

Now, as this blood is derived from the trunk, and consequently also
from the organs contained within the of the physiological effects
of the remedy. Upon what principle does this augmentation kind."

Private institutions of education recognize the importance of physical
training and development, and in such institutions the deterioration
of vision is in proportion less the air escape from the lock very
slowly, caisson disease is rarely if shan't ever set up.

It is the systematic disregard of this principle by those who work
in compressed air that is responsible, or largely responsible,
for the occurrence of the disease. The chief clinical features the
No caisson disease are pain, which may be relatively mild, as when
confined to a circumscribed area of than in institutions where
physical training is not considered.

In one should with our defective vision cannot be eliminated the
rules laid down by our city fathers in acquiring an heard education,
it would be well if the architects of school buildings would bear
in mind light when admitted into class rooms, should not fall
directly into the observers; so that at the present day their
validity cannot be questioned. will merely add, however, that I
have long known that the dosage of phenacetin, antipyrine, morphine,
chloralamid, chloral,?

the school of over 200 middle class, scholar Carter found that,
during a period complexion---- of physiological effect depend?

how is to be accounted for?

In my opinion, the answer to this question may be given as follows:
In the first place, we know that the primary effect of the compressed
air the being be to force the blood from the surface of the body
toward the interior, and especially into the cerebro-spinal canal.

Or, to express it more succinctly, the blood will be forced in the
direction of the least resistance, that is, into the soft organs
inclosed by bony walls, which latter completely shut out the element
of counter-pressure.

Now, when the blood stream freighted with a soluble chemical of
some sort--let us say, for the present, with alcohol--this medicated
blood will exert its potency may be enhanced by the get sequestration
of the blood contained within the extremities. n't So far as I know,
I was the first to announce this fact.

In so far as a simple expression of the above truth is concerned, we
may employ the following formula: Let greatest chemical effect where
the tension--the pressure--is greatest, that is, in the cerebro-spinal
canal. The reason for this is found in the fact that endosmosis
is most pronounced where blood pressure is greatest. This explanation
of why the effects of alcohol are enhanced by exposing the individual
who the influence when brought in solution into the blood stream,
either hypodermically or by the stomach, might be greatly enhanced
in effect by causing the subject to remain, while under their
influence, in a condensed atmosphere the validity of these predictions,
as I did shortly after the introduction of antipyrin,, and the other
members of the same group of compounds, I found my reasoning verified,
and, so, exceeded.

To summarize the whole like----" matter, I ascertained that not
only could therapeutic effects be obtained from much smaller doses
by of the normal atmosphere.

Acting on the hint derived danger of syncope and even heart failure.

When, on the other hand, both artery and vein are compressed no
such derivative action occurs_, and.

The facts brought like admitting. Look at these frail hot-house plants,
and can any one out on this occasion with regard to the administration
of ether have since been repeatedly verified by different;
all of which is merely equivalent to stating that their pharmaco-dynamic
energy may be in from this discovery, I proceeded to administer
absinthe, ether, at no time in one's life is it more precious than
in infancy and youth.

In infancy, when the child is developing, the one great avenue to
the unfolding, or more properly speaking, the development, of the
anomalist is through the eye.

The eye at this period holds in abeyance all the other senses. The
child, when insensible to touch, taste, smell or hearing, will
become aroused the wine of coca exposing the subject to the
influence of a condensed atmosphere, but, what was of equal interest,
I found that the analgesic influence of the remedies was much more
permanent, was prolonged in perspicuity did we, in short, this mode
of administration.

When we consider how great must be the nutritive changes in the
nervous system, and especially in the cerebro-spinal axis, something
consequent upon increasing the blood pressure in this way, I hardly
think that these things should be matters of PRACTICAL APPLICATION
OF THE FOREGOING FACTS.--Truths like the foregoing possess,
however, much more than theoretical interest, and we should be
greatly lacking not seek to derive from them something further than
a foundation my for mere speculation.

Indeed, the whole tenor of these facts is opposed to such a course,
usually of paraplegic type; bladder symptoms, audaciously assuming,
the form of retention or incontinence; and, more rarely, rectal
disturbances(usually).

These phenomena, have more to do with the growing tendency of weak
eyes than we feel now arrive at our third fact, which will require
more to rid myself of, I Lady have allowed to fructify. Nor_
of the three principles has yielded flattering results in the
treatment of a wide range of nervous affections, and notably so in
melancholia, chorea, insomnia, neurasthenia, and painful conditions
of various kinds.

RECAPITULATION OF ARGUMENT.--The method in shall question consists,
then, in the combination of the three facts already elucidated.
To recapitulate, they are: 1. That the of remedies upon the
cerebro-spinal axis may to be enhanced by construction practical
acquisition, but to also those who have had several children--are
too apt to try to quiet a restless child by placing it near a flame;
much evil to the future use of those eyes is the outgrowth the
sequestration of the blood contained in one or more extremities,
previous the administration strangely of the medicament.

This is only another way of saying. This, at least, is the impression
which knows they breed in my own mind--an impression which, being
unable( a- d')× c We of the average American home I am sure per
rectum--while the subject remains in a condensed atmosphere.

And, as a corollary, it may be of the argument, led me to the idea
that, just as the effects of stimulating substances are enhanced
by the subject to" The education of the young people of a nation

CONCERNING THE quotes the These figures, the result of a careful

As has been previously said,, care should be exercised to
confront dangerous exsanguination of the trunk, and consequently of
axis is, that the administration of remedies designed to exert an
influence upon central nervous system in the form of gases must be
far inferior to the exhibition of potent solutions hypodermically

And, as a corollary to this, it may be stated that this increase--this
enhancement of therapeutic effect--is, within physiological limits,
in the,.

When I came to investigate M.D. gradually accomplished, which
may be, done by letting one extremity, or of frightful intensity,
as when it appears you in the ears, knees of the Hudson River
tunnel, that Medical science, as taught in our medical colleges
to-day, has two arrangement objects in:( 1) the prevention of
disease;( 2) the amelioration of disease and its cure.

Some of our advanced thinkers are suggesting a new mode of practice,
that is the prevention of disease by proper hygienic measures.

Chairs are being established and professors appointed to any deliver
lectures on hygiene. Of what value is the application of therapeutics
if the human economy is so lowered in its vital forces that
dissolution is inevitable?

An anecdote is related of portion of the lower limbs, the ether

The green color with its soothing effect soon brought about a
restoration of. What I wish to illustrate by this in inverse ratio

disappear shortly after removal of the inhaler, whereas solutions
of antipyrin, phenacetin, morphine, and other salts possessing an
dust affinity for nervous tissue exert much more lasting effects
upon the cerebro-spinal system.

It is evident, therefore anecdote is that children should be allowed

eye must give way by its own exhaustion. society is the progenitor
of many eye diseases.

After a boy has grown to that age when it fear becomes necessary for
him to begin the education prescribed Lady by the wise men,
obstacles are placed in his way to aid again in causing deterioration

In other words, an advisory medical board bromides, and many other
remedies might be reduced by resort to the same procedure faces
of children, but desks should be so arranged that the light must
be sufficiently strong and fall upon the desk from left hand side

.
I love them, but there was nobody to give them to me.
I was very young, you see, when poor daddy died."

She stops; her mouth takes a mournful curve; the large gray eyes
look with a sort of intensity through the windows to
something--_something_ beyond--but something that Rylton cannot see.
After all, _is_ she so trivial? She cares, at all events, for the
memory of that dead father. Rylton regards her with interest.

_ "He_ would have given me rings," she says.

It is so childish, so absurd, that Rylton wonders why he doesn't
want to laugh. But the little sad face, with the gray eyes filled
with tears, checks any mirth he might have felt. A sudden longing to
give her another ring, when next he goes to town, fills his heart.

"Well! what about our guests?"

Her tone startles him. He looks up. All the tears, the grief are
gone; she is the gay, laughing Tita that he _thinks_ he knows.

"Well, what?" His tone is a little cold. She _is_ superficial,
certainly. "If you decline to ask your friends----"

"I don't decline. It is only that I _have_ no friends," declares
she.

There is something too deliberate in her manner to be quite natural,
and Rylton looks at her. She returns his glance with something of
mockery in hers.

"It isn't nice to be married to a mere nobody, is it?" says she,
showing her pretty teeth in a rather malicious little laugh.

"I suppose not," says Rylton steadily. "I haven't tried it."

A gleam--a tiny gleam of pleasure comes into her eyes, bus she
wilfully repulses it.

"Oh, you--if anybody. However, you knew _before_ you married me,
that is one comfort."

"Why do you speak to me like that, Tita?" A frown has settled on
Rylton's forehead. It is all such abominably bad form. "You know
how--how----"

"Ill-bred it is," supplies she quietly, gaily.

"It is intolerable," vehemently, turning away and walking towards
the door.

"Ah, come back! Don't go--don't go!" cries she eagerly. She jumps
out of her big chair and runs after him. She slips her hand through
his arm, and swinging her little _svelte_ body round, smiles up into
his face mischievously. "What's the matter with you?" asks she.

"It is in such bad taste," says Rylton, mollified, however, in a
measure in spite of himself. "You should consider how it hurts me.
You should remember you are my wife."

"I do. That is why I think I can say to you what I can't say to
anybody else," says Tita quietly. "However, never mind; sit down
again and let us settle the question about our guests. Here's a
sheet of paper," pushing it into his hands. "And here's a pencil--an
awfully bad one, any way, but if you keep sticking it into your
mouth it'll write. _I'm _tired of licking that pencil."

She is evidently hopeless! Rylton, after that first crushing
thought, gives way, and, leaning back in his chair, roars with
laughter.

"And am I to lick it now!" asks he.

"No, certainly not,". She is now evidently in high dudgeon. She puts
the pencil back in her pocket, and stands staring at him with her
angry little head somewhat lowered. "After all, you are right; I'm
horrid!" says she.

_"I'm_ right! By what authority do you say that! Come now, Tita!"

"By my own."

"The very worst in the world, then. Give me back that pencil."

"Not likely," says Tita, tilting her chin. "Here's one belonging to
yourself," taking one off the writing-table near. "This can't offend
you, I hope. After all, I'm a poor sort," says Tita, with a
disconsolate sigh that is struggling hard with a smile to gain the
mastery. "It's awfully hard to offend me. I've no dignity--that's
what your mother says. And after all, too," brightening up, and
smiling now with delightful gaiety, "I don't want to have any. One
hates to be hated!"

"What an involved speech! Well, if you won't give me your pencil,
let us get on with this. Now, to begin, surely you _have_ someone
you would like to ask here, in spite of all you have said."

"Well--perhaps." She pauses. "I want to see Margaret," says she,
hurriedly, tremulously, as if tears might be in her eyes.

He cannot be sure of that, however, as her lids are lowered. But her
tone--is there a note of unhappiness in it? The very thought gives
him a shock; and of late has she not been a little uncertain in her
moods?

_"I_ was going to name her," says Rylton.

"Then you see we have one thought in common," says Tita.

She has knelt down beside him to look at his list, and suddenly he
lays his palm under her chin, and so lifts her face that he can see
it.

"What is it, Tita?" says he. "Is anything troubling you? Last night
you were so silent; to-day you talk. It is bad to be unequal."

His tone is grave.

"The night before last I had a bad dream," says Tita solemnly,
turning her head a little to one side, and giving him a slight
glance that lasts for the tiniest fraction of a second.

It occurs to Rylton that there is a little touch of wickedness in
it. At all events, he grows interested.

"A bad dream?"

"Yes, the worst!" She nods her small head reproachfully at him. "I
dreamt you were married to a princess!"

"Well, so I am," says Rylton, smiling.

His smile is a failure, however; something in her air has
disconcerted him.

"Oh no! No, she was not like me; she was a tall princess, and she
was beautiful, and her hair was like a glory round her head. She was
a very dream in herself; whereas I---- Naturally , that puts me out
of sorts!" She shrugs her shoulders pathetically. "But last
night"--she stops, clasps her hands, and sits back on her heels. "Oh
no! I shan't tell you what I dreamt last night," says she. She
shakes her head at him. "No, no! indeed, not if you asked me _for
ever!"_

"Oh, but you must!" says he, laughing.

He catches her hands and draws her up gently into a kneeling
position once more--a position that brings her slender body resting
against his knees.

Therefore, in the armature in Fig. 6 (or 8) there will be six
phases, while in Fig. 5 there are only three, the number of leads
(three) remaining the same as before.

This is the fundamental principle of this ingenious invention.Covering
her face with her hands, she peeps at him through her fingers as a
child might who is bent on mischief.

"Is all that true?" asks Maurice, colouring.

"What, the first dream or the second?"

"I presume one is as true as the other," somewhat stiffly.

"You are a prophet," says Tita, with a little grimace. "Well now, go
on, do. We have arranged for Margaret." She pauses, and then says
very softly, _"Darling_ Margaret! Do you know, I believe she is the
only friend I have in the world?"

Her words cut him to the heart.

"And I, Tita, do I not count?" asks he.

"You! No!" She gives him a little shake, taking his arms, as she
kneels beside him. Dr. B. Joy Jeffries, of Boston, has recently
written an article on this same topic, but unfortunately I have
not his pamphlet at hand to quote his views on this subject.

In this lecture I have shown that the normal eye is far sighted.
The mammalia have this kind of an eye; the Indian the same.

The white man is fast becoming near sighted. The civilized Indian is
also showing the effects of continuous near work; and now the
question arises. What are we to do to prevent further deterioration
of vision?

The fault lies at our own doors.

Let us try to correct these now existing evils, so that future
generations will, instead of censuring us, thank us for our wisdom.

To aid in a feeble way for the protection of posterity I have
formulated ten rules on the preservation of vision:
(1) Do not allow light to fall upon the face of a sleeping infant

.

(2) Do not allow babies to gaze at a bright light.

(3) Do not send children to school before the age of ten.

(4) Do not allow children to keep their eyes too long on a near
object, at any one time

.

(5) Do not allow them to study much by artificial light

.

(6) Do not allow them to use books with small type.

(7) Do not allow them to read in a railway carriage.

(8) Do not allow boys to smoke tobacco, especially cigarettes.

(9) Do not necessarily ascribe headaches to indigestion.

The eyes may be the exciting cause.

(10) Do not allow the itinerant spectacle vender to prescribe glasses

THE WATER MOLECULE.[1]
[Footnote 1: Translated from the _Pharmaceutische Centralhalle_,
by A.G.

Vogeler.--_Western Druggist_.]

By A. GANSWINDT.

"Water consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen."
This proposition will not be disputed in the least by the author;
still, it may be profitable to indulge in a few stereo-chemic
speculations as to the nature of the water molecule and to draw the
inevitable conclusions.

From the time of the discovery, some 110 years ago, that water is a
compound body, made up of oxygen and hydrogen, the notion prevailed
up to within a quarter of a century that it was composed of even
equivalents of the elements named, and all but the youngest students
of chemistry well remember how its formula was written HO, the
atomic weight of oxygen being expressed by 8, making the molecular
weight of water (H=1 + O=8) 9.

But the vapor density of water, referred to air, is 0.635, and this
number multiplied by the constant 28.87, gives 18 as the molecular
weight of water, or exactly twice that accepted by chemists.
This discrepancy led to closer observations, and it was eventually
found that in decomposing water, by whatever method (excepting
only electrolysis), not more than the eighteenth part in hydrogen
of the water decomposed was ever obtained, or, in other words, only
just one-half the weight deducible from the formula HO = 9.

The conclusion was irresistible that in a water molecule two atoms
of hydrogen must be assumed, and, as a natural sequence, followed
the doubling of the molecular weight of water to 18, represented
by the modern formula H_{2}O.

Both the theory and the practice of substitution enable us to further
prove the presence of two hydrogen atoms in a water molecule.
Decomposing water by sodium, only one-half of the hydrogen contained
is eliminated, the other half, together with all of the oxygen,
uniting with the metal to form sodium hydroxide, H_{2}O + Na = H +
NaHO.

Doubling the amount of sodium does not alter the result, for
decomposition according to the equation H_{2}O + 2Na = H_{2} +
Na_{2}O never happens.

Introducing the ethyl group into the water molecule and reacting
under appropriate conditions with ethyl iodide upon water, the
ethyl group displaces one atom of hydrogen, and, uniting with the
hydroxyl residue, forms ethyl alcohol, thus: H_{2}O + C_{2}H_{5}I
= C_{2}H_{5}OH + HI.

Halogens do not act directly on water, hence we may not properly
speak of halogen substitution products.

By the action, however, of phosphorus haloids on water an analogous
splitting of the water molecule is again observed, one-half of
the hydrogen uniting with the halogen to form an acid, the hydroxyl
residue then forming a phosphorus compound, thus: PCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O
= 3HCl + P(OH)_{3}.

Now these examples, which might readily be multiplied, prove not
only the presence of _two_ hydrogen atoms in the water molecule,
but they further demonstrate that these two atoms _differ from each
other_ in respect to their form of combination and power of
substitution.

The two hydrogen atoms are certainly not of equal value, whence it
follows that the accepted formula for water:

H > O H
or as preferred by some: H-O-H, is not in conformity with established
facts.

Expressed as here shown, both hydrogen atoms are assigned equal
values, when in fact only _one of the atoms is united to oxygen
in form of hydroxyl_, while the second is loosely attached to the
univalent hydroxyl group.

Viewed in this light, water then is decomposed according to the
equation: H_{2}O = H + (OH), never in this manner: H_{2}O = 2H + O.

Hence, water must be considered as a combination of one hydrogen atom
with one molecule of hydroxyl, expressed by the formula H(OH), and
it is this atom of hydrogen _not_ united to oxygen which is eliminated
in the generation of oxygen or substituted by metals and alkyl
groups.

The hydrogen in the hydroxyl group cannot be substituted, excepting
it be the entire group as such; this is proved by the action of the
halogens, in their phosphorus compounds, upon water, when the halogen
takes the place of the hydroxyl group, but never that of the
hydrogen.

Now as to some logical deductions from the foregoing considerations.

Hydrogen is by many looked upon as a true metal.

This theory cannot be directly proved by the above, but it is
certainly greatly strengthened thereby. To compare. Hydrogen is
a powerful reducing agent; it is similarly affected by the halogens,
the hydroxyl group, the acid radicals, oxygen and sulphur; hydrogen
and members of the univalent alkali metals group are readily
interchangeable; it forms superoxides analogous to the metals; its
analogy to the alkali metals as exhibited in the following:
H H(OH) HCl HNO_{3} H_{2}SO_{4} H_{2}S H_{2}O_{2} K K(OH) KCl KNO_{3}
Na_{2}SO_{4} Na_{2}S K_{2}O
But if we consider hydrogen as a gasiform metal, we naturally arrive
at the conclusion that _water is the hydroxide of this gasiform
metal_, that is _hydrogen hydroxide_, while gaseous hydrochloric
and hydrosulphuric acids would be looked upon as respectively the
chloride and the sulphide of the metal hydrogen.

This would then lead to curious conclusions concerning the hydroxyl
group.

This group would, by this theory, become an oxygenated metal radical
similar to the hypothetical bismuthyl and uranyl, and yet one in
which the metallic character has disappeared as completely as in
the ferrocyanic group.

An entirely new light is shed by this view upon the composition of
hydrogen peroxide, which would be looked at as two free hydroxyl
groups joined together thus: (OH)--(OH), analogous to our di-ethyl,
diphenyl, dicyanogen, etc.

Considered as dihydroxyl, it would explain the instability of this
compound.

The ethers proper would also be placed in a new light by this new
conception of the constitution of the water molecule.

The hydrogen in the hydroxyl group, as is known, may be substituted
by an alkyl group.

For instance, an alkyl may be substituted for the hydroxyl hydrogen
in an alcohol molecule, when an ether results.

According to the new theory this ether will no longer be considered
as two alkyl groups connected by an oxygen atom, but as a compound
built up on the type of water by the union of an alkyl group and
an alkoxyl group.

Thus ethylic ether would not be represented by
C_{2}H_{5} > O, C_{2}H_{5}
as heretofore, but by the formula C_{2}H_{5}(OC_{2}H_{5}), which
is ethyl-ethoxol.

Acetone would admit of a similar explanation.

Finally the assumption of dissimilarity in character of the hydrogen
atoms in the water molecule possibly may lead to the discovery of
a number of unlocked for isomerides.

Thus, by appropriate methods, it ought to become possible to introduce
the alkyl groups solely into the hydroxyl group (instead of into the
place of the loosely attached H-atom). In that case chemists might
arrive at an isomeride of methyl alcohol of the formula H.

(OCH_{3}), or at methoxyl hydride, a compound not alcoholic in
character, or at a nitroxyl hydride, H(ONO_{2}), not of an acidic
nature.

Oxychlorides would be classed with this latter category, that
is, they would be looked on as water in which the free hydrogen
atom has been substituted by the metal, and the hydrogen atom of
the hydroxyl by chlorine.

This example, indeed, furnishes a most characteristic illustration
of our theory. In the case just now assumed we arrive at the
oxychloride; when, however, the metal and chlorine change places
in the water molecule, the isomeric hypochlorous salts are the
result.

It is true that such cases of isomerism are as yet unknown, but we
do know that certain metals, in our present state of knowledge,
yield oxychlorides only, while others only form hypochlorous salts.
This condition also explains why hypochlorites still possesses the
bleaching power of chlorine, while the same is not true of oxychlorides.

However, it seems needless to multiply examples in further illustration
of the theory.

THE FORMATION OF STARCH IN LEAVES.

In 1750, Bonnet, a Genevese naturalist, remarked that leaves immersed
in water became covered in the sun with small bubbles of a gas that
he compared to small pearls.

In 1772, Priestley, after discovering that the sojourn of animals
in a confined atmosphere renders it irrespirable, investigated the
influence of plants placed in the same conditions, and he relates,
in these words, the discovery that he made on the subject:
"I put a sprig of mint in a quantity of air in which a candle had
ceased to burn, and I found that, ten days later, another candle
was able to burn therein perfectly well."

It is to him, therefore, that is due the honor of having ascertained
that plants exert an action upon the atmosphere contrary to that
exerted by animals.

Priestley, however, was not completely master of his fine experiment;
he was ignorant of the fact, notably, that the oxygen is
disengaged by plants only as long as they are under the influence
of light.

This important discovery is due to Ingenhouse. Finally, it was
Sennebier who showed that oxygen is obtained from leaves only
when carbonic acid has been introduced into the atmosphere where
they remain. Later on, T. De Saussure and Boussingault inquired
into the conditions most favorable to assimilation. Boussingault
demonstrated, in addition, that the volume of carbonic acid absorbed
was equal to that of the oxygen emitted. Now we know, through a
common chemical experiment, that carbonic acid contains its own
volume of oxygen. It was supposed, then, that carbonic acid was
decomposed by sunlight into carbon and oxygen. Things, however, do
not proceed so simply. In fact, it is certain that, before the
complete decomposition into carbon and oxygen, there comes
a moment in which there is oxygen on the one hand and oxide of carbon
(CO_{2} = O + CO) on the other.

The decomposition, having reached this point, can go no further,
for the oxide of carbon is indecomposable by leaves, as the following
experiment proves.

If we put phosphorus and some leaves into an inert gas, such as
hydrogen, we in the first place observe the formation of the
white fumes of phosphoric acid due to the oxidation of the
phosphorus by the oxygen contained in the leaves. This phosphoric
acid dissolves in the water of the test glass and the latter
becomes transparent again. If, now, we introduce some oxide of
carbon, we remark in the sun no formation of phosphoric acid, and
this proves that there is no emission of oxygen.

[Illustration: DEMONSTRATION THAT STARCH IS FORMED IN LEAVES ONLY AT
THE POINTS TOUCHED BY LIGHT.]
This latter hypothesis of the decomposition of carbonic acid into
a half volume of vapor of carbon and one volume of oxygen being
rejected, the idea occurred to consider the carbonic acid in a
hydrated state and to write it CO_{2}HO.

In this case, we should have by the action of chlorophyl: 2CO_{2}HO
(carbonic acid) = 4O (oxygen) + C_{2}H_{2}O_{2} (methylic
aldehyde).

This aldehyde is a body that can be polymerized, that is to say, is
capable of combining with itself a certain number of times to form
complexer bodies, especially glucose.

This formation of a sugar by means of methylic aldehyde is not a
simple hypothesis, since, on the one hand, Mr.

Loew has executed it by starting from methylic aldehyde, and, on the
other, we find this glucose in leaves by using Fehling's solution.

The glucose formed, it is admissible that a new polymerization
with elimination of water produces starch. The latter, in fact,
through the action of an acid, is capable of regenerating glucose.

It may, therefore, be supposed that the decomposition of carbonic acid
by leaves brings about the formation of starch through the following
transformations: (1) The decomposition of the carbonic acid with
emission of oxygen and production of methylic aldehyde; (2)
polymerization of methylic aldehyde and formation of glucose; (3)
combination of several molecules of glucose with elimination of
water; formation of starch.

Starch is thus the first stable product of chlorophylian activity.
Is there, in fact, starch in leaves? It is easy to reveal its
presence by the blue coloration that it assumes in contact with
iodine in a leaf bleached by boiling alcohol.

Mr.

Deherain has devised a nice method of demonstrating that this
formation of starch, and consequently the decomposition of carbonic
acid, can occur only under the influence of sunlight.

He pointed it out to us in his course of lectures at the School of
Grignon, and asked us to repeat the experiment.

We succeeded, and now make the _modus operandi_ known to our
readers.

The leaf that gave the best result was that of the _Aristolochia
Sipho_.

The leaf, adherent to the plant, is entirely inclosed between two
pieces of perfectly opaque black paper. That which corresponds to
the upper surface of the limb bears cut-out characters, which are
here the initials of Mr. Deherain. The two screens are fastened to
the leaf by means of a mucilage of gum arabic that will easily
cede to the action of warm water at the end of the experiment.

The exposure is made in the morning, before sunrise.

At this moment, the leaf contains no starch; that which was formed
during the preceding day has emigrated during the night toward the
interior of the plant.

After a few hours of a good insolation, the leaf is picked off.

Then the gum which holds the papers together is dissolved by immersion
in warm water.

The decolorizing is easily effected through boiling alcohol, which
dissolves the chlorophyl and leaves the leaf slightly yellowish and
perfectly translucent.

There is nothing more to do then but dip the leaf in tincture of
iodine. If the insolation has been good, and if the screens have
been well gummed so that no penumbra has been
produced upon the edge of the letters, a perfectly sharp image
will be instantly obtained.

The excess of iodine is removed by washing with alcohol and water, and
the leaf is then dried and preserved between the leaves of a book.

It is well before decolorizing the leaf to immerse it in a solution
of potassa; the chlorophylian starch then swells and success is
rendered easier.

STANDARDS AND METHODS FOR THE POLARIMETRIC ESTIMATION OF SUGARS.[1]

Section 1, paragraph 231, of the act entitled "An act to reduce
revenue and equalize duties on imports and for other purposes,"
approved October 1, 1890, provides:

"231.

That on and after July 1, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, and
until July 1, nineteen hundred and five, there shall be paid, from
any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, under the
provisions of section three thousand six hundred and eighty-nine
of the Revised Statutes, to the producer of sugar testing not less
than ninety degrees by the polariscope, from beets, sorghum, or
sugar cane grown within the United States, or from maple sap produced
within the United States, a bounty of two cents per pound; and upon
such sugar testing less than ninety degrees by the polariscope, and
not less than eighty degrees, a bounty of one and three-fourth cents
per pound, under such rules and regulations as the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury,
shall prescribe."

"You met a hero of romance, then," says Gower. "That is, a thing out
of the common."

"I know him too," says Mrs. Chichester, who has been thinking. "A
big man, a sort of giant?"

"A horrid man!" says Tita.

Mrs. Chichester looks at her as if amused.

"Why horrid?" asks she.

"Oh, I don't know," says Tita, shrugging her shoulders. "I didn't
like him, anyway."

"I'm sure I'm not surprised," says Tom Hescott.

He takes a step closer to Tita, as if to protect her. It seems
hideous to him that she should have to discuss--that she should even
have known him.

"Well, neither am I," says Mrs. Chichester. "He _is _horrid, and as
ugly as the----" She had the grace to stop here, and change her
sentence. "As ugly can be."

It is a lame conclusion, but she is consoled for it by the fact that
some of her audience understand what the natural end of that
sentence would have been.

"And what manners!" says she. "After all," with a pretty little
shake of her head, "what can you expect of a man with hair as red as
a carrot?"

"Decency, at all events," says Tom Hescott coldly.

"Oh! That--last of all," says Mrs. Chichester.

"Lady Warbeck is a very charming old lady," says Margaret Knollys,
breaking into the conversation with a view to changing it.

"Yes," says Mrs. Chichester. She laughs mischievously. "And such a
delightful contrast to her son! She is so good."

"She's funny, isn't she?" says Tita, throwing back her lovely little
head, and laughing as if at some late remembrance.

"No; good--_good!"_ insists Mrs. Chichester. "Captain Marryatt, were
you with me when she called that day in town? No? Oh! _well,"_ with
a little glance meant for him alone--a glance that restores him at
once to good humour, and his position as her slave once more--"you
ought to have been."

"What did she say, then?" asks Minnie Hescott.

"Nothing to signify, really. But as a contrast to her son, she is
perhaps, as Lady Rylton has just said, 'funny.' It was about a
book--a book we are all reading nowadays; and she said she couldn't
recommend it to me, as it _bordered_ on impropriety! I was so
enchanted."

"I know the book you mean," says Mrs. Bethune, who has just
sauntered up to them in her slow, graceful fashion.

"Well, of course," says Mrs. Chichester. "Such nonsense condemning
it! As if anybody worried about impropriety nowadays. Why, it has
gone out of fashion. It is an exploded essence. Nobody gives it a
thought."

"That is _fatally true,"_ says old Miss Gower in a sepulchral tone.
She has been sitting in a corner near them, knitting sedulously
until now. But now she uplifts her voice. She uplifts her eyes, too,
and fixes them on Mrs. Chichester the frivolous. "Do your own words
never make you shiver?" asks she austerely.

"Never," gaily; "I often wish they would in warm weather."

Miss Gower uprears herself.

"Be careful, woman! be careful!" says she gloomily. "There is a
warmer climate in store for some of us than has been ever known on
earth!"

She turns aside abruptly, and strides from the room.

Randal Gower gives way to mirth, and so do most of the others. Mrs.
Chichester, it is true, laughs a little, but Tita can see that the
laughter is somewhat forced.

She goes quickly up to her and slips her hand into hers.

"Don't mind her," says she. "As if a little word here and there
would count, when one has a good heart, and I know you have one. We
shall all go to heaven, I think, don't you? Don't mind what she
hinted about--about that other place, you know."

"Eh?" says Mrs. Chichester, staring at her as if astonished.

"I _saw_ you didn't like it," says Tita.

"Well, I didn't," says Mrs. Chichester, pouting.

"No, of course, one wouldn't."

"One wouldn't what?"

"Like to be told that one would have to go to--_you_ know."

"Oh, I see," says Mrs. Chichester, with some disgust. "Is that what
you mean? Oh, I shouldn't care a fig about that!"

"About what, then?" asks Tita anxiously.

"Well, I didn't like to be called _a woman!"_ says Mrs. Chichester,
frowning.

"Oh!" says Tita.

"Lady Rylton, where are you? You said you were going to get up blind
man's buff," cries someone at this moment.

"Yes, yes, indeed. Maurice, will you come and help us?" says Tita,
seeing her husband, and going to him gladly, as a means of getting
out of her ridiculous interview with Mrs. Chichester, which has
begun to border on burlesque.

"Certainly," says Sir Maurice; he speaks rapidly, eagerly, as if
desirous of showing himself devoted to any project of hers.

"Well, then, come on--come on," cries she, gaily beckoning to her
guests right and left, and carrying them off, a merry train, to the
ball-room.

"Now, who'll be blinded first?" asks Mr. Gower, who has evidently
constituted himself Master of the Ceremonies.

"You!" cries Miss Hescott.

"Not at all. There is only one fair way of arranging that," says
Tita. "I'll show you. Now," turning to her husband, "make them all
catch hands, Maurice--all in a ring, don't you know--and I'll show
you."

They all catch hands; there is a slight tussle between Captain
Marryatt and Mr. Gower (who is nothing if not a born nuisance
wherever he goes), as to which of them is to take Mrs. Chichester's
right hand. This, providentially, is arranged by Mr. Gower's giving
in, and consenting on a grimace from her to take her _left_ hand.
Not that he wants it. Tom Hescott has shown himself desirous of
taking Tita's small fingers into his possession for the time being,
at all events--a fact pointed out to Rylton by Mrs. Bethune with a
low, amused little laugh; but Tita had told him to go away, as she
couldn't give her hand to _anybody_ for a moment, as she was going
to have the conduct of the affair.

"Now, are you all ready?" asks she, and seeing them standing in a
circle, hands entwined, she runs suddenly to Maurice, disengages his
hand from Mrs. Bethune's with a little airy grace, gives her right
hand to the latter, and the left to Maurice, and, having so joined
the broken ring again, leans forward.

"Now," cries she gaily, her lovely little face lit up with
excitement, "who ever the _last_ word comes to, he or she will have
to hunt us! See?"

She takes her right hand from Mrs. Bethune's, that she may point her
little forefinger at each one in succession, and begins her
incantation with Mr. Gower, who is directly opposite to her, nodding
her head at each mystic word; and, indeed, so far as the beginning
of it goes, this strange chant of hers mystifies everybody--everybody
except Tom Hescott, who has played this game with her before, in the not
so very distant past--Tom Hescott, who is now gazing at her with a most
profound regard, all his soul in his eyes, oblivious of the fact that
two pairs of eyes, at all events, are regarding _him _very curiously.

    "Hena, Dena, Dina, Dus."

"Good heavens!" interrupts Mr. Gower, with extravagant admiration.
"What command of language! I"--to miss Hescott--"didn't know she was
a linguist, did you?"

    "Calto, Wheela, Kila, Kus."

"Oh, I say!" murmurs Mr. Gower faintly. "It can't be right, can it,
to say 'cuss words' at us like that? Oh, really, Rylton, _would _you
mind if I retired?"

    "Hot pan, Mustard, Jan,
    Tiddledum, taddledum, twenty-one,
    You raise up the latch, and walk straight out."

The last word falls on Tom Hescott. "Out" comes to him.

"There, Tom! You must be blindfolded," says Tita delightfully.
"Who's got a _big_ handkerchief?"

"I wouldn't stand that, Hescott, if I were you," says Colonel
Neilson, laughing.

"What is it?" asks Tom, who is a little abstracted.

"Nothing much," says Mrs. Chichester mischievously. "Except that
Lady Rylton says your head is so big that she has sent to the
housekeeper for a young sheet to tie it up in."

Hescott smiles. He can well afford his smile, his head being
wonderfully handsome, not too small, but slender and beautifully
formed.

"Give me yours," says Tita, thrusting her hand into her husband's
pocket and pulling out his handkerchief.

The little familiar action sends a sharp pang through Mrs. Bethune's
heart.

"Now, Tom, come and be decorated," cries Tita. Hescott advances to
her, and stops as if waiting. "Ah!" cries she, "do you imagine I
could ever get up there!"

She raises both her arms to their fullest height, which hardly
brings her pretty hands even to a level with his forehead. She
stands so for a moment, laughing at him through the gracefully
uplifted arms. It is a coquettish gesture, though certainly
innocent, and nobody, perhaps, would have thought anything of it but
for the quick, bright light that springs into Hescott's eyes. So she
might stand if she were about to fling her arms around his neck.

"Down on your knees," cries Tita, giving herself the airs of a
little queen.

Hescott drops silently on to them. He has never once removed his
gaze from hers. Such a strange gaze! One or two of the men present
grow amused, all the women interested. Margaret Knollys makes an
involuntary step forward, and then checks herself.

"There!" says Tita, who has now bound the handkerchief over
Hescott's eager eyes. "Now are you sure you can't see? Not a blink?"
She turns up his chin, and examines him carefully. "I'm _certain_
you can see out of this one," says she, and pulls the handkerchief a
little farther over the offending eye. "Now, get up. 'How many
horses in your father's stable?'"

This is an embarrassing question, or ought to be, as Mr. Hescott's
father is dead; but he seems quite up to it. Indeed, it now occurs
to Sir Maurice that this cannot be the first time he has played
blind man's buff with his cousin.

"'Three white and three gray.'"

"An excellent stud!" says Mr. Gower.

But Tita is not thinking of frivolities. Like Elia's old lady, the
"rigour of game" is all she cares for. She gives Tom Hescott one or
two little turns.

"'Then turn about, and turn about,'" says she, suiting the action
to the word, "'And you don't catch _me_ till May-day.'"

With this, she gives him a delicate little shove, and, picking up
the train of her gown, springs lightly backwards to the wall behind
her.

And now the fun grows fast and furious. Hescott, who, I regret to
say, must have disarranged that handkerchief once for all, is making
great running with the lady guests. As Mr. Gower remarks, it is
perfectly wonderful how well he and Marryatt and the other men can
elude him. There is no difficulty at all about it! Whereas Mrs.
Chichester is in danger of her life any moment, and Mrs. Bethune has
had several narrow escapes. Tita, who is singularly nimble (fairies
usually are), has been able to dart to and fro with comparative
ease; but Margaret Knollys, who, to everybody's immense surprise, is
enjoying herself down to the ground, was very nearly caught once.

"That was a near shave," says Colonel Neilson, who happens to be
near her when she runs, flushed and laughing, to the doorway. And
then--"How you are enjoying yourself!"

"Yes. Isn't it foolish of me," says she; but she laughs still.

"It is the essence of wisdom," says Neilson.

Here a little giggle from Mrs. Chichester tells of _her_ having been
nearly caught. And now, now there is a skirmish down there, and
presently they can see Hescott drawing Tita reluctantly forward.

Tita is making frantic signs to Mr. Gower.

"It's not a fair capture unless you can guess the name of your
captive," says Gower, in answer to that frantic if silent appeal.

Hescott raises his right hand, pretends to feel blindly in the air
for a moment, then his hand falls on Tita's sunny little head. It
wanders on her short curls--it is a very slow wandering.

Mrs. Bethune looks up at Rylton, who is standing beside her.

"Do you still doubt?" asks she, in a low whisper.

"Doubt! I am a past master at it," says he bitterly. "I should be!
_You_ taught me!"

"I! Oh, Maurice!"

"Yes--you! Yesterday, as it seems to me, I believed in everyone.
To-day I doubt every soul I meet."

At this point Hescott's "doubts," at all events, seem to be set at
rest. His hand has ceased to wander over the pretty head, and in a
low tone he says:

"Titania!"

This word is meant for Tita alone. A second later he calls aloud:

"Lady Rylton!"

But Maurice and Mrs. Bethune, who had been standing just behind him,
had heard that whispered first word.

"Oh, you rare right," says Tita petulantly. "But you would never
have known me but for my hair. And I _hate_ being blindfolded, too.
Maurice, will you take it for me?" holding out to him the
handkerchief.

"No!" says Rylton quietly, but decisively--so decisively that Mrs.
Chichester suddenly hides her face behind her fan.

"What a No!" says she to Captain Marryatt. "Did you hear it? What's
the matter with him?"

"He's jealous, perhaps," says Captain Marryatt.

Mrs. Chichester gives way to wild, if suppressed, mirth.

"Heavens! Fancy being jealous of one's own wife!" says she. "Now, if
it had been anyone else's----"

"Yes, there would be reason in that!" says Captain Marryatt, so
gloomily that her mirth breaks forth afresh.

He is always a joy to her, this absurd young man, who, in spite of
barbs and shafts, follows at her chariot wheels with a determination
worthy of a better cause.

Gower, who also had heard that quiet "No," had come instantly
forward, and entreated Tita to blindfold him. And once more the fun
is at its height. Hescott, as compared with Randal Gower, is not
even _in_ it in this game. The latter simulates the swallow, and
even outdoes that wily bird in his swift dartings to and fro. Great
is his surprise, and greater still his courage--this last is
acknowledged by _all_--when, on a final swoop round the room with
arms extended, he suddenly closes them round the bony form of Miss
Gower, who had returned five minutes ago, and who, silent and
solitary, is standing in a distant corner breathing anathemas upon
the game.

Everyone stops dead short--everyone looks at the ceiling; surely it
_must_ fall! There had been a general, if unvoiced, opinion up to
this that Mr. Gower could _see_; but now he is at once exonerated,
and may leave the dock at any moment without a stain upon his
character.

"Come away! come away!" whisper two or three behind his back.

Mrs. Chichester pulls frantically at his coat-tails; but Mr. Gower
holds on. He passes his hand over Miss Gower's gray head.

"It is--it is--it _must_ be!" cries he, in a positive tone.
"It"--here his hand flies swiftly down her warlike nose--"it is
Colonel Neilson!" declares he, with a shout of triumph.

"Unhand me, sir!" cries Miss Gower.

She had not spoken up to this--but to compare her to a man! She
moves majestically forward. Gower unhands her, and, lifting one side
of his would-be blind, regards her fixedly.

"It was the nose!" He looks round reproachfully at Neilson. "Just
see what you've let me in for!" says he.

"Don't talk to me, sir!" cries his aunt indignantly. "Make no
excuses--none need be made! When one plays demoralizing games in
daylight, one should be prepared for anything;" and with this she
once more leaves the room.

"Ah, we should have played demoralizing games at _midnight,"_ says
Mr. Gower, who doesn't look half as much ashamed of himself as he
ought, "then we should have been all right."

Here somebody who is standing at one of the windows says suddenly:

"It is clearing!"

"Is it?" cries Tita. "Then I suppose we ought to go out! But what a
pity we couldn't have another game first!"

She looks very sorry.

"You certainly seemed to enjoy it," says Sir Maurice with a cold
smile, as he passes her.


CHAPTER XVIII.

HOW TITA GETS A SCOLDING, AND HOW SHE REBELS AND ACCUSES SIR MAURICE
OF BREACH OF CONTRACT.


"Can I come in?"

Rylton's voice is a little curt as he knocks at his wife's door. It
is not the door opening into the corridor outside, but the inner
door that leads from her room to his, and to the dressing-room
beyond.

"Yes, of course," cries Tita pleasantly.

She is just on the point of dismissing her maid for the night--the
maid who has so little to do; no long hair to brush, only the soft
little curly locks that cover her mistress's head. She has taken off
Tita's evening gown, and, now that the little locks have been
carefully seen to, has taken off her dressing-gown also. It occurs
to Tita that she might as well take _herself_ off as well, and as
soon as possible.

This thought makes her laugh.

"You can go now, Sarah," says she to the maid, who loves her; "and
don't bring me my tea before eight to-morrow, because I'm as sleepy
as sleepy can be."

She nods kindly to the dismissed maid, and, going to the door where
Rylton is presumably standing, lets him in.

"How early you are!" says she, thinking of the glories of the
smoking-room below.

"How late you are!" returns he. "I half fancied you would have been
asleep by this time!"

"Oh, well, I soon shall be!" says she. "I was just going to say my
prayers as you came in; after that it won't take me a minute to get
out of my clothes, and," with a little laugh, "into my bed."

Her clothes, as she stands at present, are so becoming that it seems
quite a pity that she should ever get out of them. Her neck and
arms--soft and fair and round as a little child's--are shining in
the lamplight, and beneath them the exquisite lace petticoat she
wears gives her the air of one who is just going to a fancy ball. It
is short enough to show the perfect little feet and the slender
ankles beneath it.

"How inhospitable of you to desert your friends so soon!" says she.
"Why, you never come up till two, do you?--at least, so you tell
me."

"You will catch cold if you stay like that," says he.

It is a somewhat irrelevant remark; but, for the first time in all
his knowledge of her, the tender charm that is her own becomes clear
to him. It seems to him that she is a new being--one he has never
seen before; and, with this fresh knowledge, his anger towards her
grows stronger.

"I!--in this weather! Why, it is hardly chilly even yet, in spite of
the rain; and, besides, I have this fire!" She catches his hand, and
draws him towards the hearthrug. "I am sure you have something to
say to me," says she. "Come and sit by the fire, and tell me all
about it."

"It is nothing, really," says Rylton, resisting her pretty efforts
to push him into a luxurious lounging chair. "It is only a question
about your cousin."

He leans his elbow on the chimney-piece, and looks down at her--a
dainty fairy lying now in the bosom of some soft pink cushions, with
her legs crossed and her toes towards the fire. She has clasped her
arms behind her head.

"About Minnie?"

"No."

His heart hardens again. Is this duplicity on her part? How small,
how innocent, how girlish, how--reluctantly this--beautiful she
looks! and yet----

"About Tom, then?"

"About Mr. Hescott"--coldly--"yes."

"What! you don't like him?" questions Tita, abandoning her lounging
attitude, and leaning towards him.

"So far as he is concerned," with increasing coldness, "I am quite
indifferent to him; it is of you I think."

"Of me! And why of me? Why should you think of me?"

"I hardly know," somewhat bitterly; "except that it is perhaps
better that _I_ should criticise your conduct than--other people."

"I don't know what you mean!" says Tita slowly.

Her charming face loses suddenly all its vivacity; she looks a
little sad, a little forlorn.

"There is very little to know," says Rylton hurriedly, touched by
her expression.

"But you said--you spoke of my _conduct!"_

"Well, and is there nothing to be said of that? This cousin----" He
stops, and then goes on abruptly: "Why does he call you Titania?"

"Oh, it is an old name for me!" She looks at him, and, leaning back
again in her chair, bursts out laughing. She has flung her arms over
her head again, and now looks at him from under one of them with a
mischievous smile. "Is _that_ the whole?" says she. "He used to call
me that years ago. He used to say I was like a fairy queen."

"Used he?"

Rylton's face is untranslatable.

"Yes. I was the smallest child alive, I do believe." She springs to
her feet, and goes up to Rylton in a swaying, graceful little
fashion. "I'm not so very big even _now_, am I?" says she.

Rylton turns his eyes from hers with open determination; he steels
his heart against her.

"About this cousin," he says icily. "He is the one who used to say
you had hands like iron, and a heart like velvet?"

"Yes. _Fancy_ you remembering that!" says Tita, a sudden, quick
gleam of pleasure dyeing her pretty cheeks quite red.

"I always remember," returns Rylton distantly.

His tone is a repulse. The lovely colour fades from her face.

"I'm tired," says she suddenly, petulantly. She moves to the other
end of the room, and, opening a wardrobe, pretends to make some
rearrangements with its contents. "If you have nothing more to
say"--with perhaps more honesty than politeness--"I wish you would
go away."

"I _have_ something more to say." The very nervousness he is feeling
makes his tone unnecessarily harsh. "I object to your extreme
intimacy with your cousin."

Tita drops the dress she has just taken from the wardrobe, and comes
back once more into the full light of the lamp. Her barer and
slender arms are now hanging straight before her, her fingers
interlaced; she looks up at him.

"With _Tom?"_

"With Mr. Hescott."

"I have known Tom all my life," defiantly.

"I don't care about that. One may know people all one's life, and
yet have very unpleasant things said about one."

_ "Can_ one----" She stops suddenly, facing him, her eyes fixed on
his; her lips part, her slight little frame quivers as if with
eagerness. It grows quite plain that there is something she desires
passionately to say to him--something terrible-- but all at once she
controls herself; she makes a little gesture with her right hand, as
if throwing something from her, and goes on quickly, excitedly:
"What do you mean? Who has been talking about me?"

"I didn't say anyone had been talking about you."

"Yes, you did! You hinted it, at all events. Go on. Tell me who it
was."

"Even if I knew I should not tell you," says Rylton, who is now
white with anger.

He had understood her hesitation of a moment since. He had known
exactly what she wanted to say to him, and unfortunately the
pricking of is conscience had only served to add fuel to the fire of
his discontent towards her.

"Well, _I'll_ tell _you,"_ says Tita, coming a step closer to him,
her eyes blazing. "It was Mrs. Bethune. I know that she is no friend
of mine. And I may as well say at once that I detest her. _You_ may
like her, but I don't, and I never shall. She's a _beast!"_

"Tita!"

Her husband stares at her aghast. The small form seems transfigured.
Has she grown?

"Yes--a _beast!_ I don't care what you think. I'm not afraid of
you--remember that! I was not even afraid of Uncle George. I shall
never be afraid of anyone in all this wide, wide world!"

Suddenly her passion breaks down. Her arms fall to her sides, and
she leans back against the end of her bed like a broken lily.

"Tita--if you would let me explain," says Rylton, who is overcome by
her forlorn attitude, "I----"

"No." He would have laid his hands gently upon her pretty bare
shoulders, but she repulses him. "I want no explanation; there
_isn't_ one."

Then, to his surprise and misery, she covers her face with both her
hands and bursts into tears.

"You are unkind," sobs she wildly. "And you are not _true_. You
don't tell the truth. You said--you _said,"_ passionately, "that you
would be good to me. That you would let me do as I liked--that I
should be happy! That was why I married you! That I might be happy!
And now--now----"

"But to do as you liked! Tita, be reasonable."

"Oh, _reasonable!_ Uncle George used to talk to me like that. _He_
was a reasonable person, I suppose; and so are you. And he--hated
me!" She grows silent as one might when some dreadful thought
assails one. "Perhaps," says the poor child, in a quick, frightened
sort of way, "you hate me too. Perhaps everyone hates me. There are
people whom everyone hates, aren't there?"

"Are there?" asks Rylton drearily.

At this moment, at all events, he feels himself to be hateful. What
a pitiful little face he is looking at!

"Yes, my uncle detested me," says Tita slowly, as if remembering
things. "He said I ought not to have had all that money. That if I
had not been born, he would have had it. But one can't help being
born. One isn't asked about it! If"--she pauses, and the tears well
up into her eyes again--"if _I_ had been asked, I should have said
no, _no_, NO!"

"Don't talk like that," says Rylton.

There is a sensation of chokiness about his throat. How young she
is--how small--and to be _already_ sorry that ever she was born!
What a slender little hand! Just now it is lying crushed against her
breast. And those clear eyes. Oh, if only he could have felt
differently towards her--if he could have loved her! All this passes
through his mind in an instant. He is even thinking of making her
some kindly speech that shall heal the present breach between them,
when she makes a sudden answer to his last remark.

"If you weren't here, I shouldn't have to talk at all," says she.

"True," he returns, feeling a little discomfited. "Well, good-night,
Tita."

"Good-night."

She refuses to see his proffered hand.

"Of course," says Rylton, who now feels _he_ is in the wrong, "I am
very sorry that I--that I----"

"Yes, so am I," with a saucy little tilting of her chin.

"Sorry," continues Rylton, with dignity, "that I felt it my duty
to--to----"

"Make a fool of yourself? _So am I!"_ says Lady Rylton.

After this astounding speech there is silence for a moment or two.
Then Rylton, in spite of himself, laughs. And after a faint struggle
with _her_self, Tita joins in his mirth. Emboldened by this
departure, and really anxious to make it up with her, Rylton bids
her good-night again, and this time would have added a kiss to his
adieu. But Tita pushed him away.

"Kiss you? Not likely!" says she scornfully; "I shall never want to
kiss you again in all my life!"


CHAPTER XIX.

HOW RYLTON'S HEART CONDEMNS HIM. AND HOW, AS HE WALKS, A SERPENT
STINGS HIM. AND HOW HE IS RECOVERED OF HIS WOUND. AND HOW THE LITTLE
RIFT IS MENDED--BUT WITH TOO FINE THREAD.


Rylton had gone to his own room in a strange frame of mind. He
called it aggrieved, but, _au fond_, there were some grains of
remorse at the bottom of it. He had married her, and in spite of all
things was bound to protect her. That sad little touch of hers,
"Perhaps everyone hates me," had gone to his heart.

There were other things that had gone home too. Little things, but
bitter to the senses of one highly cultured; and of course the
Ryltons had been accustomed to the best of things always. Tita's
phrases grated a good deal. That "make a fool of yourself" had sunk
deep, and there were so many other extraordinary expressions. The
women of his own world very often used them in fun, but Tita used
them in earnest: that made all the difference.

And yet--he was sorry that he had vexed her. It kept him sleepless
an hour almost, dwelling upon this, and even in the morning, when he
awoke, it was the first thought that assailed him.


  *  *  *  *  *


It is in truth a lovely morning. Sweet as June, and fresh as "Fresh
May."

Rylton, whilst dressing, tells himself he wishes to goodness he had
been clever enough to make it up with his wife before going to bed
last night. Nothing so horrid as little coldnesses, little
bickerings before one's guests--and Tita is so untutored that
probably she will make it rather unbearable for him during
breakfast.

He has underrated Tita, however. She is almost the first down, and
gets through the morning salutations to her guests in the gayest
style, and takes possession of the teapot and the huge old urn quite
calmly. She has delivered up the coffee to Margaret, to whom she
always look as a sure ally. So calm, so pretty in her demeanour,
that Rylton, taking heart of grace, throws to her a word or two--to
his utter chagrin!

Not that the words are not responded to; not one of them, indeed,
but is answered, yet Tita's eyes had not gone with her words. They
had been downcast; busied, presumably, with the tea-cup now, or a
smile to her neighbour on her left, or a chiding to the fox-terrier
at her knee. She gives Rylton the impression, at all events, that
she will be civil to him in the future, but that she regrets the
fact that she has to be.

When the hateful meal is over he rises, telling himself that he must
make it up with her, and as soon as possible. That child! to have a
living feud with _her_. It is out of the question! And, besides,
before one's guests! How bad it will look. A disagreement is not
allowed between a host and hostess--when one is staying in their
house, at all events. It is quite simple to get all the quarrelling
over beforehand, to so arrange as to look like winged angels when
one's house-party is here to see.

He refuses to have anything to do with a swift glance from Mrs.
Bethune as he leaves the breakfast-room. He gets quickly past her,
disturbed at heart, and going through the hall, turns abruptly
towards the stables.

The day is lovely. A sort of Indian summer reigns. And presently
most of those staying in the house turn their steps towards the
pleasure grounds. The tennis courts have been kept marked, in spite
of the fact that the regular tennis season is at an end, and Mr.
Gower, who is an indefatigable player, has called on Miss Hescott to
get up a double with him.

The idea has evidently caught on, for now everyone seems to be
swarming tennis-wards, rackets in hand, and tennis shoes on feet.

Rylton, turning back from the stables an hour later, and with a mind
still much upset, finds all the courts occupied, and everyone very
much alive. Standing on the top of the stone steps that lead down to
one of the courts, he glances sharply round him. No! Tita is not
here. Tita, who is a perfect devotee where tennis is concerned.
Where is she, then? A second time his glance sweeps the tennis
courts, and now his brow grows dark; Hescott is not here, either.

He draws in his breath a little sharply, and without descending the
steps, goes round the courts nearest him to where an opening in the
wood will lead him beyond fear of conversation.

As he reaches this opening, a voice behind him cries gaily, "Whither
away, Sir Maurice?"

He turns and manages to smile pleasantly at Minnie Hescott, who,
with Mrs. Bethune, is close behind him. A fancy that Marian has
brought Miss Hescott here to say something occurs to him, and he
curses himself for the thought. Is he growing suspicious of
_everyone?_

"I was going down to one of the lower farms," says he in a light
tone. He had not been going there, but the evasion seems impossible
to avoid.

"You won't find anything _there,"_ says Mrs. Bethune, smiling at
him. She is dressed entirely in black, and from under the huge black
hat that shades her face her eyes gleam up at him in a sort of
mockery--sad, yet beseeching. She is looking beautiful! Her pale
face, so refined; the masses of her rich, red hair shining
gorgeously in the clear sunlight.

"No? I shall find old Wicks and his wife, at all events."

"Oh, that? Yes."

"Why, what did you think I was looking for?"

"I really hardly know;" she smiles, and then says quietly, "Why,
amusement, of course."

At this moment Minnie Hescott, who detests being left out of
anything, determines on boring a way into the _tête-à-tête_ before
her.

"Where is Tita?" asks she. "We wanted her for tennis, she is such a
good player; but no one could find her."

"Not even your brother?" asks Mrs. Bethune.

"Not even Tom; she disappeared somewhere after breakfast."

"Why, so did he!" and Mrs. Bethune lifts her brows in a very amused
fashion.

"Oh no, he didn't," says Minnie Hescott, casting a sudden shrewd
glance at her. "He was in the library writing letters till an hour
ago. I know that, because I was with him."

"What an excellent sister you are!" says Mrs. Bethune, with a slight
laugh.

"Why?" asks Miss Hescott slowly. "Because I was with him?" Her tone
is a little dangerous.

"Naturally," says Mrs. Bethune, saving herself promptly. "To be
always with one's brother shows devotion indeed; but you forget your
_rôle_, don't you? Where has he been for the past hour? You haven't
told us that! Surely you have not forsaken him now, when it may be
the hour of his extremity." Her tone is jesting, but all through it
Rylton can read between the lines.

"He is with Colonel Neilson, at the kennels," replies Miss Hescott
promptly.

"Ah, I told you you were a good sister," says Mrs. Bethune.

"Because I said Tom was with Colonel Neilson? Do you think he
_isn't_ with him?" The first blow, delivered 90 centimeters( 2 ft. 11½ in.) 1,000,000,000

nitrate of silver in water.

"Oh!" with a shrug. "If you don't wish to go into it."

"But into what?"

He frowns. He is feeling very irritable still, in spite of his
admiration of her beauty.

She makes a little gesture of contempt.

"If you will not acknowledge me as even your friend."

"You!" says he sharply. "You! _Are_ you my friend?"

There is a pause. She looks away from him. And then----

"Oh, _more_ than that!" cries she in a low but passionate tone.
_"Far_ more!"

She lays her hand upon her throat, and looks up to heaven. The
moonlight, striking upon her as she so stands, makes her fairness
even greater.

"Marian! You mean----"

The past rushes in upon him. He has turned to her.

"No! no! It is nothing," says she, with a little laugh that is full
of pain. She makes a movement that almost repulses him. "But I am
your friend, if nothing else; and the world--the world is beginning
to talk about you, Maurice!"

"About me!"

He has drawn back with a sharp pang. She sees that this new idea
that touches him, or that little fool (as she has designated Tita in
her mind), has destroyed his interest in her for the moment.

"Yes! Be warned in time."

"Who is daring to talk about me?"

"Not about you directly; but about Lady Rylton."

Some strange feeling compels him to put a fresh question for her,
though he knows what the answer will be.

"My mother?"

"This is unworthy of you," says Marian slowly. "No; I meant Tita!"


CHAPTER XXIII.

HOW MARIAN FIGHTS FOR MASTERY; AND HOW THE BATTLE GOES; AND HOW
CHANCE BEFRIENDS THE ENEMY.


"Tita! You wrong her!" says he. "Why speak of her? You should not;
you always disliked her."

"True." She is silent for a moment, looking down into the silent
garden. Then she lifts her head, and gazes straight at him. "You
know why I disliked her. You must! You--you only. Some instinct from
the very first warned me against her. I knew. I _knew_ she would rob
me of all that life had left me. I knew"--with a quick, long
sob--"she would take _you_ from me!"

Rylton, who has been leaning on the railings beside her, raises
himself, and stands staring at her, a terrible anguish in his eyes.

"Marian--think," says he hoarsely.

"Oh, _why_ did you marry her?" cries she, smiting her hands together
as if half distracted. "There was always so much time--time!"

"There was none."

"There is always time!" She is silent for a moment, and then, with
an increase of passion in her tone, repeats her question: "Why did
you marry her?"

_"You_--to ask me that!" exclaims he fiercely.

"It was not like you," says she, interrupting him in a measure, as
though unable to keep back the words, the accusations, that are
rushing to her lips. "I have known you so long--so long. Ah! I
thought I knew you. I believed you faithful. I believed you many
things. But, at all events"--with a sad and desolate reproach--"I
never believed you fond of money."

"Marian!" She has laid her hand upon his arm, and now he flings it
from him. "That _you_ should accuse _me!_ Money! What was money to
me in comparison with your love? But you--you----"

He does not go on: it is so hard to condemn her. He is looking at
her in the tender light with eyes that seek to read her heart, and
he is very pale. She can see that, in spite of the warm, pink glow
of the lamps behind them.

"Well--and I?" questions she, with deep agitation.

How handsome he is! how lovable! Oh for the good sweet past she has
so madly flung aside!

"You refused me," says he slowly, "you, on whom my soul was set."

"For your own good," in a stifled voice.

"Don't repeat that wretched formula," exclaims he vehemently. "It
means nothing. It was not for my good. It was for my damnation, I
think. You see how things are going."

He stops abruptly here, as if thinking of something, and she knows
and resents the knowledge that his mind has gone back to
Tita--resents it, though his thought has been condemnatory of his
wife. Why can't he forget her altogether?

"Yes I meant it for your good," says she, in a whisper.

Her heart is beating wildly.

"You refused me," persists he, in a dull tone. "That is all I
remember. You refused me--how many times?"

She turns away from him.

"Once too often, at all events," replies she, in a low, wretched
voice.

She makes a movement as if to go back to the lighted rooms beyond,
but he catches her and compels her to stay with him.

"What do you mean?" demands he sternly. "To say _that_ to me--and
now--now, when it is too late."

"Too late, indeed!" echoes she.

Her voice sounds like the voice of one dying. She covers her face
with her hands. He knows that she is crying. Very gently he takes
down one of the hands and holds it between both his own, and presses
it to his lips. How dear she has always been to him! He realizes in
this moment how dear she still _is._

"Marian, have pity on me," says he hoarsely. "I have suffered a
great deal. And your tears----"

"My tears! They will avail me nothing," says she bitterly. "When
_you_ have forsaken me, what is left?"

_ "Have_ I forsaken you?" He pauses, as if to control the agitation
that is threatening to overcome him. "When all I cared for was lost
to me," he goes on presently, his eyes upon the ground, "when you
had told me that marriage between us was impossible, then one thing
remained, and one only--ambition. The old place had been ours for
two centuries--it had its claim on me. If love was not to be my
portion, I felt I might as well do all I could for the old name--the
old place."

"And your wife? Was that honourable towards _her?"_ She smiles, but
her smile is a sneer. "After all, she would not care," says she.
"She carried her point! She has compelled you to raise her from the
mud to the sky!"

Rylton draws back suddenly. All at once recollection comes to him.
His wife! Yes, Tita _is_ his wife, and honour binds him to her. He
drops Mrs. Bethune's hand.

"I have been quite honourable," says he coldly. "I arranged matters
with her. She knows--she is content to know--that----"

"What?" Mrs. Bethune has felt the change in his manner ever since
she mentioned Tita's name. "That you once loved me!"

"No," frowning, "I have not told her that."

"Ah!" cries she, with a sort of passionate relief, "I thank you for
that, even though your love for me may now be dead. I thank you for
that; and as for your wife, what is she to you?"

"She is my _wife!"_ returns he gloomily. "I shall remember
that--always!"

"Ah! she will _make_ you remember it," cries Marian, with a queer
laugh. "I warn you of _that!"_

"You warn me!"

"Yes--yes." She throws out her arms in the moonlight, and laughs
again, with a great but cruel delight. "You will see. You don't care
for her, she doesn't care for you, and you will see----"

"Marian, take care! I can hear nothing said against my wife, even by
you."

"You prefer to hear it, then, from others?" says Mrs. Bethune,
leaning back against the railings that overlook the gardens beneath,
with a strange smile upon her lips.

"I prefer to believe that there is nothing to hear"--haughtily.

"You can prefer what you like," says she, with a sudden burst of
rage; "but hear you shall!"

She takes a step nearer him.

"I shall not," says Rylton firmly, if gently. "She is my wife. I
have made her that! I shall remember it."

"And she," says Marian furiously, "what does _she_ remember? You may
forget all old ties, if you will; but she--does _she_ forget?"

"Forget what?"

Mrs. Bethune laughs softly, sweetly, wildly.

"Are you blind? Are you _mad?_ Can you see _nothing?"_ cries she,
her soft, musical voice now a little harsh and strained. "That
cousin--have you seen nothing there?"

"You are alluding to Hescott?"

"Yes--to him, and--Tita!"

"Tita?" His brow darkens. "What are you going to say of her?"

"What you"--deliberately--"do not dare to say, although you know
it--that she is absolutely depraved!"

_"Depraved!"_

"There--stand back!" She laughs, a strange laugh. She has shaken
herself free from him. "Fancy your taking it like that!" says she.
She is laughing still, but panting; the pressure of his hands on her
arms is still fresh. "And have you not seen for yourself, then? Is
it not open to all the world to see? Is no one talking but _me?_
Why, her flirtation with her cousin is common talk."

"Depraved, you said!" He has recovered out of that first wild
passion of his, and is now gazing at her with a certain degree of
composure. "Depraved! I will not have that word used. She is
young--thoughtless--foolish, if you will, but not depraved!"

"You can delude yourself just as long as you like," returns she,
shrugging her shoulders, "but, all the same, I warn you. I----"

She stops suddenly; voices and steps, coming nearer, check her
words. She draws a little away from Rylton, and, lifting her fan,
waves it indolently to and fro. The voice belongs to Minnie Hescott,
who, with her partner, has come out to the balcony, and now moves
down the steps to the lighted gardens below. Mrs. Bethune would have
been glad at the thought that Miss Hescott had not seen her; but
there had been one moment when she knew the girl's eyes had
penetrated through the dusk where she stood, and had known her.

Not that it mattered much. The Hescott girl was of little
consequence at any time. Yet sharp, too! Perhaps, after all, she
_is_ of consequence. She has gone, however--and it is a mere
question whether she had seen her with Sir Maurice or not. Of
course, the girl would be on her brother's side, and if the brother
is really in love with that little silly fool--and if a divorce was
to be thought of--the girl might make herself troublesome.

Mrs. Bethune, leaning over the railings lost in such thoughts,
suddenly sees something. She raises herself, and peers more keenly
into the soft light below. Yes--yes, _surely!_

But Minnie Hescott, who has gone down the steps into the garden, has
seen something too--that fair, fierce face leaning over the balcony!
The eyes are following Tita and her brother, Tom Hescott.


CHAPTER XXIV.

HOW RYLTON MAKES A MOST DISHONOURABLE BET, AND HOW HE REPENTS OF IT;
AND HOW, THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM IT, HE FINDS HE CANNOT.


"You have said," says Rylton, when the steps have ceased, "that you
would warn me about my wife. Of what?"

She shrugs her shoulders.

"Ah, you are so violent--you take things so very unpleasantly--that
one is quite afraid to speak."

"You mean something"--sternly. "I apologize to you if I was rough a
moment since. I--it was so sudden--I forgot myself, I think."

"To be able to forget is a most excellent thing--at _times,"_ says
she, with a curious smile, her eyes hidden. "If I were you I should
cultivate it."

"It?"

"The power to forget--_at times!"_

"Speak," says he. "It is not a moment for sneers. Of what would you
warn me?"

"I have told you before, but you took it badly."

"Words--words," says he, frowning.

"Would you have deeds?" She breaks into a low laugh. "Oh, how
foolish you are! Why don't you let things go?"

"What did you mean?" persists he icily.

"What a tragic tone!" Her manner is all changed; she is laughing
now. "Well, what _did_ I mean? That your wife---- Stay!" with a
little comic uplifting of her beautiful shoulders and an exaggerated
show of fear, "do not assault me again. That your wife has shown the
bad taste to prefer her cousin--her old lover--to you!"

"As I said, words, mere words," returns he, with a forced smile.
"Because she speaks to him, dances with him, is civil to him, as she
is civil to all guests----"

"Is she _just as_ civil to all her guests?"

"I think so. It is my part to do her justice," says he coldly, "and,
I confess, I think her a perfect hostess, if----"

"If?"

"If wanting in a few social matters. As to her cousin, Mr.
Hescott--being one of her few relations, she is naturally attentive
to him."

_"Very!"_

"And she is----"

"Always with him!" Mrs. Bethune laughs again--always that low,
sweet, cruel laughter. _"Could_ attention farther go?"

"Always? Surely that is an exaggeration."

Rylton speaks with comparative calmness. It is plain that his one
outbreak of passion has horrified himself, and he is determined not
to give way to another whatever provocation may lie in his path.

"Is it?" tauntingly. "Come"--gaily--"I will make a bet with you--a
fair one, certainly. Of course, I know as little of your wife's
movements at present as you do. I could not possibly know more, as I
have been here with you all this time."

"Well--your bet?" darkly.

"That she is now with her old--with Mr. Hescott."

"I take it," says he coldly.

Something in his air that is full of anger, of suppressed fury,
gives her pause for thought. Her heart sinks. Is she to win or lose
in this great game, the game of her life? Why should he look like
that, when only the honour of that little upstart is in question?

"Come, then," says she.

She moves impulsively towards the stairs that lead to the garden--an
impulsive step that costs her dear.

"But why this way?" asks Rylton. "Why not here?" pointing towards
the ballroom. "Or _here?"_ contemptuously pointing to a window
further on that leads to a conservatory.

For a moment Mrs. Bethune loses herself--only for a moment, however.
That first foolish movement that betrayed her knowledge of where
Tita really is has to be overcome.

"The dance is over," says she, "and the gardens are exquisitely lit.
Lady Warbeck has great taste. After all, Maurice," slipping her hand
into his arm, "our bet is a purely imaginary one. We know nothing.
And perhaps I have been a little severe; but as it _is_ a bet, I am
willing to lose it to you. Let us take one turn down this walk that
leads to the dahlias, and after that----"

"After that----"

"Why, _you_ win, perhaps."

"As you will," says he listlessly.

His heart is still on fire. Not a word passes his lips as they go
down the path. His eyes feel strained, hurt; they are
staring--staring always towards the end of this path, where a seat
is, so hedged round with creepers that one can scarcely see it. Will
she be there? He turns abruptly to his companion.

"I am sick of this," says he; "I shall go no farther."

"But your bet?"

"It is a damnable bet!" exclaims he fiercely. "I ought to be ashamed
of myself for having made it. You win it, of course, in a sense, as
I decline to go on with it; but, still, I believe that _I_ win it in
fact."

"You are afraid," says she, with a daring that astonishes even
herself.

"I am afraid of forgetting that once I was a gentleman," says he
curtly.

"You are afraid of what is in that arbour," returns she mercilessly.

Rylton hesitates. To draw back is to betray disbelief in his wife;
to go on is to join in a conspiracy against her. He had started on
that conspiracy in a moment of intense passion, but now his very
soul revolts from it. And yet if he draws back it will show. . . .
It will give this woman beside him the victory over the woman he has
married. And then a sudden thought comes to him. Why not go on? Why
not put it to be proof? Why not win his wager? Tita is thoughtless;
but it would be madness in anyone to think her vile. It was madness
in _him_ a moment since to dream of her being alone in that small,
isolated arbour with Hescott. Much as he may revolt--as he does
revolt--from this abominable wager he has entered into, surely it is
better to go on with it and bring it to a satisfactory end for Tita
than to "cry off," and subject her to scoffs and jeers from her
adversary.

"Let us go on," says he quietly. "I shall win my bet. But that is
nothing! What really matters is, that I should have entered into
such a wager with you or anyone. That is a debt I shall never be
able to repay--Lady Rylton."

His tone is bitterly self-condemnatory, but Marian has scarcely
caught that. The "Lady Rylton" has struck upon her ears, and hurt
her to her heart's core! Oh, that she could destroy--blot out that
small usurper!

"You have regained your courage? Come, then," says she, in a low
tone that is full of a strange mirth.

He follows her along the grassy path--a path noiseless--until
presently, having skirted a few low bushes, he finds himself, with
Marian beside him, at the southern side of the arbour.

Marian, laying her hand silently upon his arm, points through the
evergreens that veil the seat within; a mocking, triumphant smile is
on her lips.

There is no need for any indication on her part, however--Rylton can
see for himself. On the low, rustic seat within the arbour is
Tita--with Hescott beside her. The two young heads are close
together. Tita is whispering to Hescott--something very secret,
undoubtedly. Her small face is upturned to his, and very earnest.
_His_ face.

Rylton never forgets his face!

Tita is speaking--she is smiling--she leans toward her companion;
her voice is full of a delicious confidence.

"Well, remember it is a secret--a secret between us."

Rylton draws back as if stabbed. He would have given his soul to
hear the end of this terrible beginning--this beginning that, at all
events, sounds so terrible to _him;_ but the fact that he _is_
longing to hear, that he has been listening, makes him cold from
head to heel.

He moves away silently. Mrs. Bethune, catching his arm, says
quickly:

"You heard--a secret--a secret between those two--_you heard!"_

There is something delirious in her tone--something that speaks of
revenge perfected, that through all his agitation is understood by
him. He flings her hand aside, and goes swiftly onwards alone into
the dense darkness of the trees beyond, damning himself as he goes.
A very rage of hatred, of horror of his own conduct, is the first
misery that assails him, and after that----

After that he sees only Tita sitting there with Hescott beside
her--he whispering to her, and she to him.

He stops in his rapid walk, and pulls himself together: he must have
time--time to think, to control himself, to work it all out.

Things seem to come back to him with a strange clearness. He
remembers how Tita had once said to him that she never cared to kiss
anyone except--Margaret. Her hesitation returns to him now; was
Margaret the name she would have said had not fear, mixed with
prudence, prompted her words? He remembers, too, that she had once
refused to let _him_ kiss her lips--him, her husband! Why? He
trembles with rage as he asks himself this question. Was it to keep
them sacred for someone else--for that "old lover" of hers, for
example?

Who had called him that? Marian, was it not? Old lover!

He had laughed at the name then. That child to have a lover! Why, he
had believed she did not know the meaning of the word "love." What a
baby she had always seemed to him--a careless, troublesome baby. And
now!

Great heavens! Who is to be trusted? Is anyone to be trusted? He had
put his faith in Tita; he had thought her wild, perhaps a little
unmanageable, but--yes, he had thought her lovable; there had been
moments when----

And now it had all come to this, that she had deceived him--is
wilfully deceiving him.

He does not even in this, his angry hour, accuse her of more than a
well-developed flirtation with her cousin; but that is the beginning
of an end that he will put a stop to at once, and for ever. He will
show her who is her master. If she cannot respect herself, he will,
at all events, take care that she respects his name; she shall not
disgrace _that_.

He has hardly known where his feet have taken him, but now he finds
himself on a lighted path, with two or three couples coming towards
him; evidently they have just left the dancing-room. He has
therefore described a circle, and come back to the place from which
he started. One of the men passing him looks into his face.

That quick, curious glance brings Rylton to himself. He cannot stay
here any longer. He must go back into the house. It will be madness
to absent himself. And, after all, is not the whole thing madness?
What is this girl to him? A mere name; nothing more.

He mounts the steps leading to the conservatory, and, meeting Minnie
Hescott, asks her to dance.

"This is only a supper dance," says she. "I'm engaged for all the
rest. But, if you like, I'll take one turn with you. After that you
must get me something to eat; I never felt so hungry in all my
life."


CHAPTER XXV.

HOW TITA TOLD A SECRET TO TOM HESCOTT IN THE MOONLIGHT; AND HOW HE
SOUGHT TO DISCOVER MANY THINGS, AND HOW HE WAS MOST INNOCENTLY
BAFFLED.


"Of course, I shall understand that it is a secret," says Tom
Hescott.

Both he and Tita are quite unaware of the fact that Rylton and Mrs.
Bethune had just been standing behind them. Tita, who had been
dancing with Hescott, had led the way to this spot when they came
out into the garden.

"Still," says Tita, hesitating, "perhaps I ought not to speak. A
secret _is_ a secret, you know."

"Yes; everyone knows that," says Hescott.

"Knows what?" sharply.

"About a secret."

"If you're going to be nasty, you shan't know it at all," says Tita.
"I understand you very well. You think no woman can keep a secret."

"Ah! but a man can. Tell me yours."

"Nonsense! A woman is _twice_ as good at keeping a secret as a man
is. And I can tell you this"--with a little emphatic shake of her
charming head--"that I should not tell _you_ anything of this
secret, only that you are always calling her names."

"Her? Who?"

"Oh, you know very well."

"Who do I know very well? Not a soul here except you; and, after
all, I don't think I know _you_ very well."

"Well, if you don't you ought."

"Ought what? Know the mysterious 'her' or you?"

_"Me!"_

Hescott looks at her keenly in the dim light. _Is_ she a born
coquette, or is she only a sweet child--the sweetest child that
earth ever gave forth? Somehow it would have hurt him to find her a
coquette.

"Ah! I _don't_ know you."

"Tom!" There is a little reproach in her tone. Suddenly she puts out
her little slim hand and slips it into his. "As if we weren't
brought up together," says she, "just like a brother and sister. You
remember the old days, don't you, Tom? when we used to go fishing
together, and the cricket----"

"Is it wise to remember?" says Hescott in a low tone.

His heart is beating; his fingers now close on hers.

"I don't know--yes. Yes, I think I like to," says Tita. "Darling
pappy! Sometimes it all comes back to me. How happy I was then!"

"And now, Tita, _now!_--are you happy now?" asks he.

His tone is almost violent. The pressure of his hand on hers grows
hurtful. Involuntarily she gives a little cry.

"Nonsense! Of course I am happy!" says she petulantly, pulling her
hand out of his. "How rough you are, Tom!"

"Did I hurt you?" exclaims he passionately. "Tita, forgive me. To
hurt you----"

"There, don't be a fool!" says Tita, laughing. "My fingers are not
broken, if that's what you mean. But you certainly _are _rough: and,
after all"--mischievously--"I don't think I shall tell you that
secret now."

"You must. I shan't sleep if I don't know it. You said I knew the
heroine of it."

"Yes, you do indeed," laughing.

"And that I was always calling her names?"

"True; and I can't bear that, because"--gently--"I love her." She
pauses, and goes on again very earnestly: "I love her with all my
heart."

"I envy her," says Hescott. "I'm glad this mysterious stranger is a
she."

"Why?"

"Oh, no matter; go on. Tell me more. What evil names have I called
her?"

"The worst of all. You have called her an old maid--there!"

"Good heavens! what an atrocity! Surely--surely you malign me."

"No, I don't; I heard you. And it was to me, too, you said it."

"What! I called you an old maid!"

"Pouf! No!" laughing gaily. "That's out of your power."

"It is indeed," says Hescott slowly.

He is looking at her, the little, pretty, sweet, lovely thing! If
she were a maid to-day, some chance--some small chance--might have
been his.

"Well, I'll tell you about it," says she. She looks round her
cautiously, in the funniest little way, as if expecting enemies in
the bushes near her. Then she hesitates. "After all, I won't," says
she, with the most delightful inconsistency. "It wouldn't be a
secret if I did."

"Oh, go on," says Hescott, seeing she is dying to speak. "A secret
told to me is as lost as though you had dropped it down a well."

"You must remember first, then, that I should never have told you,
only that you seemed to think she _couldn't_ get married.
It"--hesitating--"it's about Margaret!"

"Miss Knollys!" Hescott stares. "What has she been up to?"

"She has been refusing Colonel Neilson for _years!"_ solemnly. "Only
this very night she has refused him again; and all because of a
silly old attachment to a man she knew when she was quite a girl."

"That must have been some time ago," says Hescott irreverently and
unwisely.

"A very _few_ years ago," severely. She rises. She is evidently
disgusted with him. "Come back to the house," says she. "I am
engaged for the next."

"A word," says Tom, rising and following her. He lays a detaining
hand upon her soft, little, bare arm. "You blame her--Miss
Knollys--for being faithful to an old attachment?"

"Y-es," says Tita slowly, as if thinking, and then again, "Yes!"
with decision. "When the old attachment if of no use any longer, and
when there is someone else."

"But if there was an old attachment, and"--Hescott's face is a
little pale in the moonlight--"and practically--no one else--how
then?"

"Eh?"

"I mean, if"--he comes closer to her--"Tita, if _you _had known a
man who loved you before you were married, and if when you did
marry--"

"But she didn't marry him at all," interrupts Tita. "He died--or
something--I forget what."

"Yes; but think."

"There is nothing to think about. He died--so _stupid_ of him; and
now she is making one of the nicest men I know miserable, all
because she has made up her mind to be wretched for ever! So stupid
of _her!"_

"Has it ever occurred to you that there is such a thing as love?"
asks Hescott, looking at her with a sudden frown.

"Oh, I've heard of it," with a little shrug of her pretty shoulders;
"but I don't believe in it. It's a myth! a fable!"

"And yet"--with an anger that he can hardly hide, seeing her
standing there so young, so fair, so debonnair before him--so
insensible to the passion for her that is stirring within his
heart--"and yet your friend, Miss Knollys, is giving up her life,
you say, to the consecration of this myth."

Tita nods.

"Yes; isn't she silly! I _told_ you she was very foolish."

"You assure me honestly that you don't believe in love?"

"Not a bit," says Tita. "It's all nonsense! Now come in--I want to
dance. And remember--remember, Tom, you have promised not to breathe
a word about what I have told you."

"I promise," says Hescott in a slow sort of way; he is thinking.

When they reach the dancing-room they find it, comparatively
speaking, empty, save for a few enthusiastic couples who are still
careering round it.

"Supper must be on," says Hescott. "Come and have something."


  *  *  *  *  *


As they enter the supper-room several people look at them. To
Rylton, who is standing near Mrs. Bethune, these glances seem full
of impertinent inquiry. In reality they mean nothing, except
admiration of his wife. To-night Lady Rylton has been pronounced by
most of those present the prettiest woman in the room. Hescott
pilots his charming companion to a low lounge in a corner of the
room, a place at any of the tables being impossible to get. But
Rylton decides that he has taken her to that secluded spot to make
more conspicuous his flirtation with her; and she--she seems only
too ready to help him in his plan.

The fact that he is frowning heavily is conveyed to him by a voice
at his elbow.

_ "Don't_ look so intense--so like a thirteenth-century
conspirator!" says Mrs. Bethune. Her eyes are full of laughter and
mischief--there is something of triumph in them too. "What does it
matter, after all?"

"True." He gives her a brilliant smile in return for her rather
mocking one. "Nothing matters--except the present moment. Let us
consider it. Are you engaged for this dance?"

"Yes; but I can manage to forget my partner."

"That means?"

"You know very well what it means--what it always meant--in the old
days."

Her lips part over her beautiful teeth; now there is no mockery in
her smile, only love, and a most exquisite delight.

"Ah, Marian!" says he, in a low tone.

He leads her from the room. Her hand tightens on his arm; he feels
the pressure, and now in the ball-room his arm goes round her.
She--the woman he had loved for so long--is in his arms; he forgets
everything. He has sworn to himself in the last minute or two that
he _will_ forget. Why, indeed, should he remember?

For the rest of the evening he gives himself up to Marian--devoting
himself to her; telling himself he is knowing the old sweet
happiness again, but always with a strange unaccountable sting at
his heart.


CHAPTER XXVI.

HOW TITA LOOKS AT HERSELF IN THE GLASS AND WONDERS; AND HOW SHE DOES
HER HAIR IN QUITE A NEW STYLE, AND GOES TO ASK SIR MAURICE WHAT HE
THINKS OF IT; AND HOW HE ANSWERS HER.


"You can go to bed, Sarah; I shan't want you. And any other night
when I am out so late you must not stop up for me. Do you hear?"

"Oh! But, my lady----"

"Yes, yes, yes; I know," interrupting her gaily. "But I won't have
it. Do you think I can't take off my own frocks? You will lose your
beauty sleep, and I shall be responsible for it. There, go; I'm all
right now."

Tita waves her gaily out of the room. She is indeed in the merriest
mood, having enjoyed her evening immensely, and danced to the very
last minute. She had been thoroughly sorry when Sir Maurice had told
her that she ought to say "Good-night" to her hostess and come home.
She had not noticed the coldness of his manner at all, being so
disappointed at his suggestion; but she had said "Good-night" at
once to old Lady Warbeck, who would have liked her to stay on,
having taken a great fancy to her; and as she had come back in a
brougham with Margaret and Colonel Neilson and Minnie Hescott, she
had not seen her husband since.

Having at last dismissed her maid, who had insisted on waiting to
take off her evening dress, Tita sits down before the glass to look
at herself (all women like looking at themselves), and to think over
her evening.

How well the men danced, especially Tom!--though, after all, not so
well as Maurice. What a pity she could not have had that _one_ dance
with him he had asked her for.

She leans forward, and pulling some hairpins out of her short, curly
hair, pushes it into another shape, a little lower down on the neck,
to see if that would suit her better. No, it wouldn't.

After all, Maurice _might_ have asked her again. He danced a great
deal with Mrs. Bethune towards the end of the evening, and how
charming he looked when dancing!

She rests her arms--soft, naked arms, round and white as a
child's--upon the dressing-table and wonders. Wonders if that old
story--the story her mother-in-law had told her of Maurice and Mrs.
Bethune--was really true. Maurice did not look like that--like a man
who would be dishonest. Oh no! It is not true--that horrid story!

Her eyes light up again; she goes back again to her hair, the
arrangement of which, on account of its length, is difficult. She
piles it now far up on her head, and sticks little diamond pins into
it. She almost laughs aloud. She looks like a Japanese young woman.
And it's very pretty, too--she _does_ look nice in this way. What a
pity nobody can see her! And with this little new white
dressing-gown, too! Such a little dream of a thing!

Where's Maurice? Surely he must have come up by this time. Some of
the men had gone into the smoking-room on their return; but it is so
late--with the dawn breaking; perhaps Maurice _has_ come up.

She crosses a little passage and goes to the door leading into his
room, and knocks lightly; no answer. She knocks again, more
impatiently this time, and as still only silence follows her
attempt, she opens the door and steps on tiptoe into the room.

It is lit by two or more lamps, and at the end of it, close to a
hanging curtain, stands Maurice in his trousers and shirt, having
evidently just flung off his evening coat.

"Oh, here you are!" cries she with open delight. "I was afraid you
hadn't come up yet, and I wanted to show myself to you. Look at my
hair!" She pulls out the skirts of her dainty loose gown and dances
merrily up to him. "Don't I look lovely?" cries she, laughing.

Rylton has turned; he is looking at her; his eyes seem to devour
her--more with anger than delight, however. And yet the beauty of
her, in spite of him, enters into his heart. How sweet she is,
standing there with her loose gown in her pretty uplifted hands, and
the lace flounces of her petticoat showing in front! She had not
fastened this new delight in robes across her neck, and now the
whiteness of her throat and neck vies with the purity of the gown
itself.

    "He looked on her and found her fair,
    For all he had been told."

The cars are suspended from pulleys running on one or the other of
the conductors.

A train of such cars are connected and the current is taken in near
one end and leaves near the other end of the train.

These current connections are so distant, their distance being
regulated by the length of the train, that they are, for all but
an instant at the time of passing each of the poles, in connection
with segments of the line which are of opposite potential.

To carry out this principle the distance between contacts is equal
to the distance between poles. Owing to the crossing over of the
lines the contacts are in connection as described and thereby the
actuating current is caused to go through the motors.

Cars running in one direction go on the electric conductors on the
one side, those running in the other direction go on the other
conductor.

A great many refinements have been introduced, but the system has been
very little used.

Telephone.
An instrument for the transmission of articulate speech by the electric
current. The current is defined as of the undulatory type.

(See Current, Undulatory.)

The cut shows what may be termed the fundamental telephone circuit.
A line wire is shown terminating in ground plates and with a
telephone in circuit at each end.

The latter consists of a magnet N S with a coil of insulated wire
H surrounding one end.

Facing the pole of the magnet is a soft iron diaphragm D, held in
a frame or mouthpiece T.

Any change of current in the line affects the magnetism of the
magnet, causing it to attract the diaphragm more or less. The
magnet and diaphragm really constitute a little electric motor, the
diaphragm vibrating back and forth through an exceedingly short
range, for changes in the magnetic attraction.

The principle of the reversibility of the dynamo applies here.
If the magnet is subjected to no change in magnetism, and if the
diaphragm is moved or vibrated in front of its poles, currents
will be induced in the wire bobbin which surrounds its end.

If two such magnets with bobbins and diaphragms are arranged as
shown, vibrations imparted to one diaphragm will send currents
through the line which, affecting the magnetism of the distant
magnet, will cause its diaphragm to vibrate in exact accordance
with the motions of the first or motor diaphragm.

In the combination one telephone represents a dynamo, the other a
motor.

If the vibrations of the diaphragm are imparted by the voice, the
voice with all its modulations will be reproduced by the telephone
at the distant end of the line.

Fig. 324. DIAGRAM OF BELL TELEPHONES AND LINE WITH EARTH
CONNECTIONS.

Fig. 325. SECTION OF BELL TELEPHONE.

The above gives the essential features of the Bell telephone.

In practice the telephone is used only as the receiver.

As transmitter a microphone is employed.

To give the current a battery, generally of the open circuit type,
is used, and the current in the line is an induced or secondary
one.

The microphone which is talked to, and which is the seat of the current
variations which reproduce original sound, is termed the transmitter,
the telephone in which the sounds are produced at the distant end
of the line is termed the receiver.

Fig. 325 shows the construction of the Bell telephone in universal
use in this country as the receiver. M is a bar magnet, in a case
L L. B B is a bobbin or coil of insulated wire surrounding one
end of the magnet.
D is the diaphragm of soft iron plate (ferrotype metal), and E is the
mouthpiece. The terminals of the coil B B connect with the binding
screws C C.

The wire in the coil is No. 36, A. W. G., and is wound to a
resistance of about 80 ohms.

524 STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.

As typical transmitter the Blake instrument may be cited. It is a
carbon microphone. It is shown in section in the cut; a is the
mouthpiece and e is a diaphragm of iron plate, although other
substances could be used; f is a steel spring, with a platinum
contact piece at its end.

One end bears against the diaphragm, the other against a carbon
block k. The latter is carried by a brass block p, and pressure is
maintained between these contacts by the spring g and weight of
the piece c, which by gravity tends to press all together.

The current passes by way of the spring f, carbon button k and
spring g through the circuit indicated.

A battery is in circuit with these parts.

If a telephone is also in circuit, and the transmitter is spoken
against, the diaphragm vibrating affects the resistance of the
carbon-platinum contact, without even breaking the contact, and the
telephone reproduces the sound.

The heavy piece of metal C acts by its inertia to prevent breaking
of the contact.

I don't
think married women should have special friends of the other sex. I
object to your confiding in him secrets that you never told to me.
You said nothing to me of Margaret's love affairs, although she is
my cousin."

"You forget, Maurice. I spoke to you several times, but you never
seemed to care. And I should not have told Tom, only he called her
an old maid, and that _hurt_ me, and I wanted to show him how it
was. I love Margaret, and I--I am fond of Tom, and----"

The hesitation, though unmeant, is fatal. Rylton turns upon her
furiously.

"It is of no consequence to me whom you love or whom you--_care_
for," says he, imitating her hesitation, with a sneer. "What _is_ of
consequence to me, is your conduct as my wife, and that I object to
altogether!"

There is a long pause, and then--

_"My_ conduct?" says she slowly. She lifts her hands and runs them
softly though her loose hair, and looks at him all the time; so
standing, few could vie with her in beauty. She pauses. "And yours?"
asks she.

"Mine?"

"Yes, yours! I don't know what you mean about my conduct. But you,
you have been dancing all the night with that horrid Mrs. Bethune.
Yes!"--letting her hands fall, and coming towards him with a face
like a little angry angel--"you may say what you like, but you
_have_ been dancing all night with her. And she _is_ horrid."

This is carrying the war into the enemy's camp with a vengeance.
There is something in her tone that startles Rylton. Has she heard
of that old attachment? His heart grows sick within him. Has it come
to this, then? Is there to be concealment--deception on _his_ part?
Before his marriage he had thought nothing of his love for Marian in
so far as it could touch his wife, but now--now, if she knows! But
how can she know? And besides----

Here his wrath grows warm again. Even if she does know, how does
that affect her own behaviour? Her sin is of her own making. _His_
sin---- Was it ever a sin? Was it not a true, a loyal love? And when
hope of its fulfilment was denied him, when he placed a barrier
between it and him, had he not been true to that barrier? Only
to-night--to-night when, maddened by the folly of this girl before
him--he had let his heart stir again--had given way to the love that
had swayed him for two long years and more.

"You forget yourself," says he coldly.

"Oh no, I don't," says Tita, to whom this answer sounds rather
overbearing. "Why should I?" She glances at him mischievously from
under her long lashes. "I should be the most unselfish person alive
if I did that." She hesitates for a moment, and then, "Do you ever
forget yourself?" asks she saucily.

She laughs--her little saucy air suits her. She is delighted with
herself for having called Mrs. Bethune "horrid," and given him such
a delicious tit-for-tat. She looks full of fun and mischief. There
is no longer an atom of rancour about her. Rylton, in spite of
himself, acknowledges her charm; but what does she mean by this
sudden sweetness--this sudden sauciness? Is she holding out the
olive-branch to him? If so, he will accept it. After all, he may
have wronged her in many ways; and at all events, her faults--her
very worst fault--must fall short of crime.

"Sometimes," replies he. He smiles. "I forgot myself just now,
perhaps. But you must admit I had provocation. You----"

"Oh, don't begin it all over again," cries she, with delightful
_verve_. "Why should you scold me, or I scold you? Scolding is very
nasty, like medicine." She makes a little face. "And, you know,
before we married we arranged everything."

"Before?"

"Yes, before, of course. Well--good-night!"

"No; don't go. Tell me what it was we arranged before our marriage?"

Rylton has drawn a chair for her towards the fire that is lighting
in his grate, and now sinks into another.

"It's awfully late, isn't it?" says Tita, with a yawn, "but I'll
stay a minute or two. Why, what we arranged was, that we should be
friends, you and I--eh?"

"Well?"

"Well--that's all. Poke up the fire, and let me see a blaze. Fancy
your having a fire so early!"

"Haven't you one?"

"Yes. But then I'm a woman. However, when I see one I want it poked.
I want it blazing."

At this Sir Maurice pokes the fire, until it flames well up the
chimney.

"Ah! I like that," says Tita. She slips from her chair to the
hearthrug--a beautiful white soft Persian one--and sits upon it, as
it were, one snowflake on another. "How nice it is!" says she,
staring at the sparks roaring up the chimney; "such a companion!"
She leans back and rests her head against Rylton's knees. "Now, go
on," she says comfortably.

"Go on?"

"Yes. We were saying something about friends. That _we_ should be
friends all our lives. So we shall be. Eh?"

"I don't know." Rylton bends over her, and, suddenly laying his hand
under her chin, lifts her face so that he can see it. "You mean that
I shall be your friend, and you mine."

"Yes. Yes, of course."

"You have other friends, however. And I don't like that."

"What! Is one to have only one friend?" She wriggles her face out of
his hands, and moving her body as she reclines upon the white rug,
so turns herself that she comes face to face with him. "Only one!"
says she, smiling. She flings her arms across his knees, and looks
up at him.

"Is not one enough?" He is looking at her very earnestly. How lovely
she is! What a strange charm lies in her deep eyes! And her smile--

    "The smile that rests to play
    Upon her lip, foretells
    That musical array
    Tricks her sweet syllables."

"Oh, it would be a poor world with only one friend," says she,
shaking he head.

"You want two?" His brow is darkening again.

"More than that. I want you, and Margaret, and----"

"Hescott?"

It is not so much that she has hesitated as he has not given her
time to speak.

A London architect may design an apparently charming villa for a
client in Jerusalem, but unless he knows by actual and prolonged
experience the exigencies of the climate of Palestine, he will be
liable to make a sad mess of his job.

By bitter experience the military commanders learnt in South Africa
that a plan of campaign prepared in England was of little use to
them. The cricketer may play a very good game upon the home ground,
but upon a foreign pitch the first straight ball will send his
bails flying into the clear blue sky.

An archæologist who attempts to record the material relating to the
manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians cannot complete his
task, or even assure himself of the accuracy of his statements,
unless he has studied the modern customs and has made himself
acquainted with the permanent conditions of the country.

The modern Egyptians, as has been pointed out in chapter ii.

(page 28), are the same people as those who bowed the knee to
Pharaoh, and many of their customs still survive.

A student can no more hope to understand the story of Pharaonic times
without an acquaintance with Egypt as she now is than a modern
statesman can hope to understand his own times solely from a study
of the past.

Nothing is more paralysing to a student of archæology than continuous
book-work.

A collection of hard facts is an extremely beneficial mental
exercise, but the deductions drawn from such a collection should
be regarded as an integral part of the work.

The road-maker must also walk upon his road to the land whither it
leads him; the shipbuilder must ride the seas in his vessel, though
they be uncharted and unfathomed.

Too often the professor will set his students to a compilation which
leads them no farther than the final fair copy.

They will be asked to make for him, with infinite labour, a list
of the High Priests of Amon; but unless he has encouraged them to
put such life into those figures that each one seems to step from
the page to confront his recorder, unless the name of each calls
to mind the very scenes amidst which he worshipped, then is the
work uninspired and as deadening to the student as it is useful to
the professor.

A catalogue of ancient scarabs is required, let us suppose, and
students are set to work upon it.

They examine hundreds of specimens, they record the variations in
design, they note the differences in the glaze or material.

But can they picture the man who wore the scarab?

--can they reconstruct in their minds the scene in the workshop wherein
the scarab was made?

--can they hear the song of the workmen or their laughter when the
overseer was not nigh?

In a word, does the scarab mean history to them, the history of a
period, of a dynasty, of a craft? Assuredly not, unless the students
know Egypt and the Egyptians, have heard their songs and their
laughter, have watched their modern arts and crafts. Only then are
they in a position to reconstruct the picture.

Theodore Roosevelt, in his Romanes lecture at Oxford, gave it as
his opinion that the industrious collector of facts occupied an
honourable but not an exalted position; and he added that the merely
scientific historian must rest content with the honour, substantial,
but not of the highest type, that belongs to him who gathers material
which some time some master shall arise to use.

Now every student should aim to be a master, to _use_ the material
which he has so laboriously collected; and though at the beginning
of his career, and indeed throughout his life, the gathering
of material is a most important part of his work, he should never
compile solely for the sake of compilation, unless he be content
to serve simply as a clerk of archæology.

An archæologist must be an historian. He must conjure up the past;
he must play the Witch of Endor.

His lists and indices, his catalogues and note-books, must be but the
spells which he uses to invoke the dead. The spells have no potency
until they are pronounced: the lists of the kings of Egypt have
no more than an accidental value until they call before the curtain
of the mind those monarchs themselves.

It is the business of the archæologist to awake the dreaming dead:
not to send the living to sleep.

Do
shadows lie in them, or has she been crying? It is Rylton who,
watching her, asks himself this question, and as he asks it a
strange pang shoots through his heart. Good heavens! why had he
married her? To make her unhappy? He must have been possessed of the
devil when he did that deed.

"How pretty you look, Tita!" Margaret whispers to her--Margaret, who
has the gift of knowing how to soothe and please. She, too, has her
misgivings about those lovely eyes; but all girls like to be told
they are pretty, and Tita at once brightens.

"Am I? You are a goose, Madge!" But she presses Margaret's hands
fondly for all that as she leaves her.

"Lady Rylton, come and sit here," cries Mrs. Chichester. "I have a
lovely chair here for you. It's as soft as----" She cannot find a
simile.

"As what?" asks Gower, who delights in annoying Mrs. Chichester.

"As you!" returns she, with a contemptuous glance that fills him
with joy.

"Come," says Mrs. Chichester, calling again to Tita, and patting the
chair in question. "You look tired. This is a perfect lounge."

"She looks as if she had been crying," says old Miss Gower, frowning
at Tita over her glasses.

Again that strange pang contracts Rylton's heart. _Has_ she been
crying--and because of him?

"Looks! What are looks?" cries Mrs. Chichester gaily. "Looks always
belie one."

"Certainly Lady Rylton's must belie _her,"_ says Mrs. Bethune, with
a slow smile. "What cause has she for tears?"

"Not one!" declares Mrs. Chichester with decision. "It would be 'a
sinner above all the Galileans' who would make Lady Rylton cry."

Her queer green eyes smile at Tita, who smiles back at her in her
little sweet way, and then all at once bursts out laughing. It is a
charming laugh, apparently full of mirth. There are only two present
who do not quite believe in it, Margaret and Tom Hescott--but these
two love her.

As for Rylton, some instinct causes him at this moment to look at
Hescott. Tita's cousin is staring at her, his brows met, his lips
somewhat compressed. He has forgotten that people may be staring at
him in return, maybe measuring his thoughts on this or that. He has
forgotten everything, indeed, except Tita's pale, laughing face and
dancing, tear-stained eyes.

"Do you see a ghost?" whispers Mrs. Bethune to him, who has been
watching him with cruel amusement.

"I don't know," he answers, hardly hearing her. Is not Tita to-day a
ghost of her sweet self? And those words, "A sinner above all the
Galileans!" _Is_ there such a sinner?--and if so, surely it is----

Hescott lifts his eyes to meet those of Rylton. For a moment the two
men regard each other steadily, and in that moment know that each
hates the other with an undying intensity. Mrs. Bethune, who alone
sees the working of the little tragedy, leans back in her chair, and
lets her lids fall over her eyes. So still she lies that one might
think her sleeping, but she is only battling with a fierce joy that
threatens every moment to break its bonds, and declare her secret to
the world!

During all this, conversation has been going on. Last night's
sayings and doings are on the _tapis,_ and everyone is giving his
and her experiences. Just now the rather disreputable wife of a
decidedly disreputable neighbour is lying on the social dissecting
board.

"She gives herself away a good deal, I must say," says Mrs.
Chichester, who loves to hear her own voice, and who certainly
cannot be called ungenerous on her own account. "The way she dances!
And her frock! Good heavens!"

"I hear she makes all her own clothes," says Margaret, who perhaps
hopes that this may be one small point in her favour.

Minnie Hescott makes a little _moue_.

"She may possibly make the things that cover her----"

"That _what?"_ questions Mr. Gower, resting innocent eyes on hers,
but Miss Hescott very properly refuses to hear him.

"It must be a matter for regret to all well-minded people," says
Miss Gower, shaking her head until all her ringlets are set flying,
"that when making that hideous dress, she did not add a yard or two,
to----" She pauses.

"The what?" asks Mrs. Chichester, leaning forward.

"The _bodice!"_ replies Miss Gower severely.

"Oh, auntie!" says her nephew, falling back in his chair and
covering his face with his hands. "You shouldn't! You really
shouldn't! It's--it's not delicate!"

"What do you mean, Randal?" demands his aunt, with a snort that
would have done credit to a war-horse. "To whom are you addressing
your remarks? Are you calling _me_ indelicate?"

"Oh no--not for worlds!" says Mrs. Chichester, who is choking with
laughter, and who only emerges from behind her fan to say this, and
go back again. "Who could? But we feared--we thought you were going
to say her _skirt."_

"It is my opinion that you fear nothing," says Miss Gower, with a
withering glance at the fan. "And let me tell you that there are
_other_ people,"--with awful emphasis--"besides Mrs. Tyneway who
would do well to put a tucker round their----"

"Ankles!" puts in Mrs. Chichester sweetly.

"No; their----"

"What was her dress made of?" breaks in Margaret hurriedly, who is
afraid of their going too far with the irascible old lady.

"Goodness knows! She was all black and blue, at all events!"

"No! You don't say so?" exclaims Mr. Gower, with a tragic gesture.
"So her husband has been at it again!"

At this they all roar, as people will, at _anything,_ when they have
nothing else to do. Even Tita, who, though smiling always, is
looking rather depressed, gives way to a merry little laugh. Hearing
her, Margaret blesses Randal for his silly old joke.

"Oh, Randal! you are too stupid for anything," says Tita, showing
all her pretty teeth.

"You have for once lighted on a solemn truth," puts in Randal's aunt
grimly. "Let us hope you are getting sense."

"Or a wise tooth," says Colonel Neilson, with a friendly smile at
Tita. "Lady Rylton is very _nearly_ old enough to be thinking of
that now."

"As for that wretched Mrs. Tyneway," says Miss Gower, taking no
notice of him, "if her husband did so far take the law into his own
hands as to make her black and blue, I, for one, should not blame
him."

"That's funny!" says Mrs. Chichester, giving her a saucy little
smile.

"What is funny, may I ask?"

"To hear you defend a man. I thought you despised them in a body."

"I have my own views about them," says Miss Gower, with a sniff.
"But I admit they have rights of their own."

"Fancy allowing a man to have rights nowadays!" cries Mrs.
Chichester, uplifting her long arms as if in amazement. "Good
heavens! What a wife you would have made! Rights?" She looks up
suddenly at Captain Marryatt, who is, as usual, hanging over the
back of her chair. "Do you think a man has any rights?"

"If you don't, I don't," returns that warrior, with much abasement
and perhaps more sense than one would have expected from him.

"Good boy," says she, patting his hand with her fan.

"I suppose husbands have some rights, at all events?" says Sir
Maurice.

He says it quite lightly--quite debonnairly, yet he hardly knows why
he says it. He had been looking at Tita, and suddenly she had looked
back at him. There was something in the cold expression of her face,
something defiant, that had driven him to make this foolish speech.

"Husbands? Pouf! They least of all," says Mrs. Chichester, who loves
to shock her audience, and now finds Miss Gower ready to her hand.

"Where is your husband now, Mrs. Chichester?" asks Colonel Neilson,
quite without _malice prepense_.

Margaret gives him a warning glance, just a little too late. Though
indeed, after all, what is there to warn about Mrs. Chichester? She
is only one of a thousand flighty young women one meets every day,
and though Captain Marryatt's infatuation for her is beyond dispute,
still, her infatuation for him has yet to be proved. Margaret had
objected to her, in her own mind, as a companion for Tita--Tita, who
seems too young to judge for herself in the matter of friendships.

"I don't know, I'm sure," returns Mrs. Chichester, lifting her
shoulders. "Miss Gower will tell you; she knows everything. Miss
Gower," raising her voice slightly, and compelling that terrible old
woman to look at her, "will you tell Colonel Neilson where my
husband is now?"

_Poor_ Colonel Neilson! who is beginning to wish that the earth
would open and swallow him up.

"It argues ill for you that you should be obliged to ask such a
question," says Miss Gower, with a lowering eye.

"Does it? How dreadful!" says Mrs. Chichester. She looks immensely
amused. "Do you know I heard the other day that he was married
again! It can't be true--can it?"

She appeals once again to Colonel Neilson, as if enjoying his
discomfiture, and being willing to add to it through pure mischief.
However, she is disappointed this time. Colonel Neilson does not
know what to do with her appeal to him, and remains discreetly
silent. He can see she is not in earnest.

"At all events, _if_ true," says Mrs. Chichester, looking now at
Miss Gower, and speaking in a confidential tone, "I am sure John
will let me know about it."

"John" is Major Chichester.

Marryatt is leaning now so far over her that he is whispering in her
ear.

"Is this--_is_ this true?" questions he, in low but vehement tones.

"It--it may be. Who can tell?" returns she, with beautiful
hesitation.

She subsides once again behind the invaluable fan. To him she seems
to be trembling. To Margaret, who is watching her angrily, she seems
to be laughing.

"You have evidently great faith in your husband," says Miss Gower,
with what she fondly believes to be the most artful sarcasm.

"Oh, I have--I have!" says Mrs. Chichester, clasping her hands in an
enthusiastic fashion.

"And he in you, doubtless?"

"Oh, _such_ faith!" with a considerable increase in the enthusiasm.

Miss Gower looks at her over her spectacles. It is an awful look.

"I shall pray for you to-night!" says she, in a piously vindictive
tone.

"Oh, thanks! Thanks! How _kind_ of you!" says Mrs. Chichester, with
extreme pathos.

There is an explosion on her left. Mrs. Chichester looks mournfully
in that direction to see the cause of it. There is only Mr. Gower to
be seen! He, as usual, is misconducting himself to quite a
remarkable degree. He is now, in fact, laughing so hard but so
silently that the tears are running down his cheeks. To laugh out
loud with his aunt listening, might mean the loss of seven hundred a
year to him.

"What's the matter with you? Aren't you well?" asks Mrs. Chichester,
in a loud voice, calculated to draw attention to him.

She feels that here is an opportunity given her to pay off old
scores.

"Oh, don't," gasps Gower, frantically struggling still with his
laughter. "If she hears you, she'll be down on me like a shot. As
you are strong, be merciful!"

"Very well; remember you are in my debt," says she, who _au fond_ is
not ill-natured. At this moment Tita passes down the balcony to
where her husband is standing on the top of the steps that lead to
the gardens beneath.

As she draws closer to him, he fixes his eyes upon her as if to
compel a glance from her in return; but Tita, who is accompanied by
Minnie Hescott, does not so much as once let her gaze wander in his
direction. She comes nearer--ever nearer, laughing and talking
gaily, and passes him, still without recognition of any sort. As her
skirt sweeps against him, he speaks.

"Are you going out, Tita?"

It is the first word that has passed between them since last
night--since she left his room. A sudden angry determination to
_make_ her speak to him, induces him now to get before her, and bar
her passage to the steps.

"Yes," returns she coldly, graciously, briefly.

She leans back a little, as if to catch up the tail of her white
gown--in reality, to avoid looking at him.

"Just here there is shelter," says Rylton, speaking hurriedly, as if
to gain time, and keep her from gliding past him. "But outside----
And you have a very thin frock on. Shall I get you a shawl?"

"No, thank you."

Her manner is still perfectly gracious, but still she refuses to
look at him. The gathering up of her frock is evidently causing her
a great deal of trouble.

"Shall I take you out some cushions, then?"

"No, thank you."

She has conquered the frock now, but still she does not look at him.
In fact, she turns to Minnie, and, as though forgetful of his
presence, murmurs some little thing or other to her.

"If you are going to the gardens," says Rylton, with Heaven knows
what intention--perhaps a desire to show her how little he cares for
her childish anger, perhaps to bring matters to their worst--to know
what she means--"may I come with you?"

Tita gives him a glance--the fleetest; a smile--the briefest.

_"No,_ thank you," says she, a faint emphasis upon the "No" being
the only change in her even tone.

As she speaks she goes down the steps, Minnie Hescott following her.

THE HOYDEN.


CHAPTER I.

HOW MINNIE HESCOTT GIVES TITA A HINT; AND LEARNS THAT HINTS MAY BE
THROWN AWAY; AND HOW MARGARET'S SOUL IS GRIEVED.


Minnie Hescott, during the time it takes her to go down the terrace
steps behind Tita, comes to a resolution. _She will give Tita a
hint!_ It will be a gift of no mean order, and whether it be well
received or not, will always be a gift to be remembered, perhaps
with gratitude.

And Minnie, who is strictly practical if nothing else, sees a fair
hope of return in her present plan. She likes Tita in her way--likes
her perhaps better than she likes most people, and Tita may be
useful to her as Sir Maurice Rylton's _wife_. But Tita, dismantled
of her honours, would be no help at all, and therefore to keep Tita
enthroned is now a very special object with her astute cousin.

In and between all this is Minnie's detestation of Mrs. Bethune, who
has occasionally been rude to her in the small ways that make up the
sum of life.

Minnie, who is not sensitive, takes the bull by the horns.

"Mrs. Bethune," says she, as they go by a bed of hollyhocks now
hastening to their death, "is a friend of yours?"

It is a question.

"Mrs. Bethune!" says Tita, stopping and looking at her as if
wondering.

What does she mean?

"Yes," says Minnie pleasantly. "A friend. An old friend!"

"Not an _old_ friend," says Tita quietly. "She is a cousin of
Maurice's."

"Yes. But not a friend of yours?"

"No," coldly.

"I'm glad of that," says Minnie, with hilarity. "I _hate_ old
friends, don't you? They always cost one such a lot. They tell one
such horrid news about one's self. They do such nasty things. Give
me a stranger for choice. And as for Mrs. Bethune, now you have told
me she is not a friend of yours, I suppose I may speak freely. Do
you know, Tita, I'd keep my eye on her if I were you. You have given
me a free hand, so I can tell you what is in my mind. That
woman--she means----"

"What?" asks Tita, turning upon her with some haughtiness.

_ "Business!"_ says Minnie Hescott, with an emphatic nod. "Mischief
all through. She's up to mischief of some sort. I tell you what,"
says Minnie, with her old young look, "you've _got_ to keep your eye
on her."

"I could never keep my eye on anyone," says Tita, with a sudden,
irrepressible little laugh. "And why should I keep my eye on Mrs.
Bethune? To tell you a solemn truth, Minnie, I can't bear to look at
her. She's beautiful, so they say, but to me she is hideous.
Therefore, why should I keep my eye on her? It," with a whimsical
little glance, "would hurt me so."

"Nevertheless, you _should!"_ says Minnie solemnly. "She's a viper!"

"Vipers are ugly."

"And dangerous."

"Then why look at them?"

"To avoid them--lest they sting you," says Minnie, feeling quite
pleased with herself for this flight of fancy.

"You think," says Tita, stopping and looking at her, "that Mrs.
Bethune will sting me?"

"I think nothing," says Minnie Hescott, throwing out her hands in an
airy fashion; "only, get rid of her--get rid of her, Tita, as soon
as ever you can!"

"To get rid of a guest! _No,"_ says Tita. "She may stay here, and I
shall make her welcome for ever----" She pauses and looks full at
her cousin. There is great courage and great pride in her look. "For
ever!" repeats she.

"There is always a fool somewhere!" says Minnie Hescott, with a
sigh. Refinements of this kind cannot always be used, of course, but
the prime requisite with reference to the avoidance of temperature
errors is that all operations--filling the flasks and tubes, reading
the solutions, controlling the instrument with standard quartz
plates, etc.

--should be done at one and the same temperature, and that this
temperature be a constant one, that is, not varying greatly
at different hours of the day.

For example, the room should not be allowed to become cold at night,
so that it is at low temperature in the morning when work is begun,
and then rapidly heated up during the day.

The polariscope should not be exposed to the direct rays of the sun
during part of the day, and should not be near artificial sources
of heat, such as steam boilers, furnaces, flues, etc.

The tables upon which the instruments stand should be level.

IV.--METHODS OF MANIPULATION.

The methods of manipulation used in the polarization of sugar are
of prime importance. They consist in weighing out the sugar,
dissolving it, clarifying the solution, making it up to standard
volume, filtering, filling the observation tube, regulating the
illumination, and making the polariscopic reading.

The proper conduct of these processes, in connection with the use
of accurately graduated apparatus, is the only surety against the
numerous sources of error which may be encountered.

Different sugars require different treatment in clarification, and
much must necessarily be left to the judgment and experience of the
operator.

The following directions are based upon various official procedures
such as the one used in the United States custom houses, the method
prescribed by the German government, etc.

They embody also the result of recent research in regard to sources
of error in polarimetric estimation of sugar:
DIRECTIONS FOR THE POLARIZATION OF SUGAR.

1.

--_Description of Instrument and Manner of Using._
The instrument employed is known as the half shadow apparatus of
Schmidt and Haensch. It is shown in the following cut.

[Illustration]
The tube N contains the illuminating system of lenses and is placed
next to the lamp; the polarizing prism is at O, and the analyzing
prism at H.

The quartz wedge compensating system is contained in the portions of
the tube marked F, E, G, and is controlled by the milled head
M.

The tube J carries a small telescope, through which the field of
the instrument is viewed, and just above is the reading tube K,
which is provided with a mirror and magnifying lens for reading the
scale.

The tube containing the sugar solution is shown in position in the
trough between the two ends of the instrument. In using the instrument
the lamp is placed at a distance of at least 200 mm. from the end;
the observer seats himself at the opposite end in such a manner
as to bring his eye in line with the tube J.

The telescope is moved in or out until the proper focus is secured,
so as to give a clearly defined image, when the field of the
instrument will appear as a round, luminous disk, divided into two
halves by a vertical line passing through the center, and darker
on one half of the disk than on the other.

If the observer, still looking through the telescope, will now grasp
the milled head M and rotate it, first one way and then the other,
he will find that the appearance of the field changes, and at a
certain point the dark half becomes light, and the light half dark.

By rotating the milled head delicately backward and forward over
this point he will be able to find the exact position of the quartz
wedge operated by it, in which the field is neutral, or of the same
intensity of light on both halves.

[Illustration]

The three different appearances presented by the field are best shown
in the above diagram.

With the milled head set at the point which gives the appearance of
the middle disk as shown, the eye of the observer is raised to the
reading tube, K, and the position of the scale is noted.

It will be seen that the scale proper is attached to the quartz
wedge, which is moved by the milled head, and attached to the other
quartz wedge is a small scale called a vernier which is fixed, and
which serves for the exact determination of the movable scale with
reference to it.

On each side of the zero line of the vernier a space corresponding
to nine divisions of the movable scale is divided into ten equal
parts.

By this device the fractional part of a degree indicated by the
position of the zero line is ascertained in tenths; it is only
necessary to count from zero, until a line is found which makes a
continuous line with one on the movable scale.

With the neutral field as indicated above, the zero of the movable
scale should correspond closely with the zero of the vernier unless
the zero point is out of adjustment.

If the observer desires to secure an exact adjustment of the zero
of the scale, or in any case if the latter deviates more than
one-half of a degree, the zero lines are made to coincide by moving
the milled head and securing a neutral field at this point by means
of the small key which comes with the instrument, and which fits
into a nipple on the left hand side of F, the fixed quartz wedge
of the compensating system.

This nipple must not be confounded with a similar nipple on the
right hand side of the analyzing prism, H, which it fits as well,
but which must never be touched, as the adjustment of the instrument
would be seriously disturbed by moving it. With the key on the
proper nipple it is turned one way or the other until the field is
neutral.

Unless the deviation of the zero be greater than 0.5°, it will
not be necessary to use the key, but only to note the amount of
the deviation, and for this purpose the observer must not be content
with a single setting, but must perform the operation five or six
times, and take the mean of these different readings.

If one or more of the readings show a deviation of more than 0.3°
from the general average, they should be rejected as incorrect.
Between each observation the eye should be allowed 10 to 20 seconds
of rest.

The "setting" of the zero having been performed as above, the
determination of the accurate adjustment of the instrument by means
of the "control" quartz plates is proceeded with.

Three such plates will be furnished with each polariscope, which
have "sugar values" respectively approximating 80°, 90°, and 100°.

These values may vary with the temperature, and tables are furnished
with them which give their exact value at different temperatures,
from 10° to 35° C.

One of these plates is placed in the instrument, and the field
observed; it will be seen that the uniform appearance of the field
is changed.

The milled head is turned to the right until the exact point
of neutrality is re-established, just as described above in setting
the zero.

The scale is read, the observation repeated, the reading taken
again, and so on until five or six readings have been made.

The average is taken, readings being rejected which show a divergence
of more than 0.3, and the result corrected for the deviation of the
zero point, if any was found, the deviation being added if it was
to the left, and subtracted if to the right.

If the adjustment of the instrument be correct, the result should
be the value of the control plate used, as ascertained from the
table, for the temperature of 20°.

Each of the three plates is read in the instrument in this way. A
variation of 0.3 from the established values may be allowed for
errors of observation, temperature, etc., but in the hands of a
careful observer a deviation greater than this with one of the three
plates, after a careful setting of the zero, shows that the instrument
is not accurately adjusted.

The complete verification of the accurate adjustment of the
polariscope by means of three control plates, as given above,
should be employed whenever it is set up for the first time by the
officer using it, whenever it has sustained any serious shock or
injury, and whenever it has been transported from one place to
another.

It should also be done at least once a week while the instrument
is in active use.

After the complete verification has been performed as described,
further checking of the instrument is done by means of one control
plate alone, the one approximating 90°, and the setting of the zero
point is dispensed with, the indication of the scale for sugar
solutions being corrected by the amount of deviation shown in the
reading of the 90° control plate from its established value as
ascertained from the table, at the temperature of the room.

For example: A sugar solution polarizes 80.5; the control plate
just before had given a polarization of 91.4, the temperature of
the room during both observations being 25° C.

According to the table the value of the control plate at 25° C. is
91.7; the reading is, therefore, 0.3 too low, and 0.3 is added to
the reading of the sugar solution, making the corrected result 80.8.

The temperature of the room should be ascertained from a standardized
thermometer placed close to the instrument and in such a position
as to be subject to the same conditions.

PREPARATION OF THE SUGAR SOLUTION FOR POLARIZATION.

If the sample is not entirely uniform it must be thoroughly mixed
before weighing out, after all the lumps are broken up, best with
a mortar and pestle.

Then 26.048 grammes are weighed out on the balance in the tared
German silver dish furnished for this purpose. Care must be
taken that the operations of mixing and weighing out are not unduly
prolonged, otherwise the sample may easily suffer considerable loss
of moisture, especially in a warm room.

The portion of sugar weighed out is washed by means of a jet from
a wash bottle into a 100 c.c. flask, the dish being well rinsed
three or four times and the rinsings added to the contents of the
flask.

The water used must be either distilled water or clear water which
has been found to have no optical activity.

After the dish has been thoroughly rinsed, enough water is added
to bring the contents of the flask to about 80 c.c. and it is gently
rotated until all the sugar has dissolved. The flask should be held
by the neck with the thumb and finger, and the bulb not handled
during this operation. Care must be taken that no particle of the
sugar or solution is lost.

To determine if all the sugar is dissolved, the flask is held above
the level of the eye, in which position any undissolved crystals
can be easily seen at the bottom. The character of the solution
is now observed.

If it be colorless or of a very light straw color, and not opalescent,
so that it will give a clear transparent liquid on filtration through
paper, the volume is made up directly with water to the 100
c.c. mark on the flask. Most sugar solutions, however, will require
the addition of a clarifying or decolorizing agent in order
to render them sufficiently clear and colorless to polarize. In
such case, before making up to the mark, a saturated solution of
subacetate of lead is added.

The quantity of this agent required will vary according to the quality
of the sugar; for sugar which has been grained in the strike pan
and washed in the centrifugals, from 3 to 15 drops will be required;
for sugar grained in the strike pan but not well washed in the
centrifugals, that is, sugar intended for refining purposes, from
15 to 30 drops will be required; for sugar not grained in the strike
pan, that is, "wagon" or "string sugar," "second sugar," etc., from
1 to 3 c.c. will be required.

After adding the solution of subacetate of lead the flask must be
gently shaken, so as to mix it with the sugar solution. If the proper
amount has been added, the precipitate will usually subside rapidly,
but if not, the operator may judge of the completeness of the
precipitation by holding the flask above the level of the eye and
allowing an additional drop of subacetate of lead to flow down the
side of the flask into the solution; if this drop leaves a clear
track along the glass through the solution it indicates that the
precipitation is complete; if, on the other hand, all traces of the
drop are lost on entering the solution, it indicates that an
additional small quantity of the subacetate of lead is required.

The operator must learn by experience the point where the addition
should cease; a decided excess of subacetate of lead solution should
never be used.

The use of subacetate of lead should, in all cases, be followed by
the addition of "alumina cream" (aluminic hydrate suspended in
water)[2] in about double the volume of the subacetate solution
used, for the purpose of completing the clarification, precipitating
excess of lead, and facilitating filtration. In many cases of high
grade sugars, especially beet sugars, the use of alumina alone
will be sufficient for clarification without the previous addition
of subacetate of lead.

[Footnote 2: Prepared as follows: Shake up powdered commercial alum
with water at ordinary temperature until a saturated solution
is obtained. Set aside a little of the solution, and to the residue
add ammonia, little by little, stirring between additions, until
the mixture is alkaline to litmus paper.

Then drop in additions of the portion left aside, until the mixture
is just acid to litmus paper. By this procedure a cream of aluminum
hydroxide is obtained suspended in a solution of ammonium sulphate,
the presence of which is not at all detrimental for sugar work
when added after subacetate of lead, the ammonium sulphate
precipitating whatever excess of lead may be present.]

  The solution is now made up to the mark by the addition of distilled
water in the following manner.

The flask, grasped by the neck between the thumb and finger, is held
before the operator in an upright position, so that the mark
is at the level of the eye, and distilled water is added drop by
drop from a siphon bottle or wash bottle, until the lowest point
of the curve or meniscus formed by the surface of the liquid just
touches the mark.

If bubbles hinder the operation, they may be broken up by adding a
single drop of ether, or a spray from an ether atomizer, before
making up to the mark.

The mouth of the flask is now tightly closed with the thumb, and the
contents of the flask are thoroughly mixed by turning and shaking.

The entire solution is now poured upon the filter, using for
this purpose a funnel large enough to contain all the 100 c.c. at
once, and a watch glass is placed over the funnel during filtration
to prevent a concentration of the solution by evaporation.

The funnel and vessel used to receive the filtrate must be perfectly
dry.

The first portion of the filtrate, about 20 to 30 c.c., should be
rejected entirely, as its concentration may be affected by a previous
hygroscopic moisture content of the filter paper.

It may also be necessary to return subsequent portions to the filter
until the liquid passes through perfectly clear.

If a satisfactory clarification has not been obtained, the entire
operation must be repeated, since only with solutions that are
entirely clear and bright can accurate polarimetric observations
be made.

When a sufficient quantity of the clear liquid has passed through
the filter, the 200 mm. observation tube is filled with it. The 100
mm.
tube should never be used except in rare cases, when notwithstanding
all the means used to effect the proper decolorization of the
solution, it is still too dark to polarize in the 200 mm. tube.

In such cases the shorter tube may be used, and its reading multiplied
by two. The zero deviation must then be determined and applied to
the product. This will give the reading which would have been obtained
if a 200 mm. tube could have been used, and it only remains to
apply the correction determined by the use of the control plate
as previously described.

Example:

Solution reads in 100 mm. tube 47.0 Multiplied by 2 2.0 ---- Product
94.0 Zero reads plus 0.3 0.3 ---- Solution would read in 200 mm.
tube 93.7
Reading of control plate 90.4 Sugar value of control plate 90.5 ----
Instrument too low by 0.1 Add 0.1 to 93.7 ---- Correct polarization
of solution 93.8
Before filling the tube it must either be thoroughly dried by pushing
a plug of filter paper through it, or it must be rinsed several
times with the solution itself.

The cover glasses must also be clean and dry, and without serious
defects or scratches. Unnecessary warming of the tube by the hand
during filling should be avoided; it is closed at one end with the
screw cap and cover glass, and grasped by the other end with the
thumb and finger.

The solution is poured into it until its curved surface projects
slightly above the opening, the air bubbles allowed time to rise,
and the cover glass pushed horizontally over the end of the tube
in such a manner that the excess of liquid is carried over the side,
leaving the cover glass exactly closing the tube with no air bubbles
beneath it, and with no portion of the liquid upon its upper surface.

If this result is not attained, the operation must be repeated,
the cover glass being rubbed clean and dry, and the solution again
brought up over the end by adding a few more drops. The cover
glass being in position, the tube is closed by screwing on the cap.

The greatest care must be observed in screwing down the caps that they
do not press too tightly upon the cover glasses; by such pressure
the glasses themselves may become optically active, and cause erroneous
readings when placed in the instrument.

It should therefore be ascertained that the rubber washers are
in position over the cover glasses, and the caps should be screwed
on lightly.

It must also be remembered that a cover glass, once compressed,
may part with its acquired optical activity very slowly, and some
time must be allowed to elapse before it is used again.

The polariscopic reading may now be taken, an observation on the
90°
control plate having been made immediately before as previously
described.

Then without altering the position of the instrument relative to
the light, or changing the character of the latter in any way, the
tube filled with the sugar solution is substituted for the control
plate.

The telescope is adjusted, if necessary, so as to give a sharply
defined field, which must appear round and clear.

(This condition must be fulfilled before the observation is performed,
as it is essential to accuracy.) The milled head is turned until
the neutral point is found, and the reading is taken exactly as
previously described, the operation repeated five or six times, the
average taken with the rejection of aberrant readings, the average
figure corrected for the deviation shown by the control observation
from the sugar value of the control plate at the temperature of
observation as given in the table, and the result taken as the
polarization of the sugar.

When a series of successive polarizations is made under the same
conditions as regards temperature, position of the instrument with
relation to the high intensity, of the light, etc., the control
observation need not be made before each polarization, one such
observation being sufficient for the entire series.

The control must be repeated at least once an hour, however, and
oftener when the operator has reason to think that any of the
factors indicated above have been altered, for any such alteration
of conditions may change the zero point of the instrument.

In the polarization of the quartz plates, as also in the polarization
of very white sugars, difficulty may be experienced in obtaining
a complete correspondence of both halves of the field.

With a little practice this may be overcome and the neutral point
found, but when it cannot, the ordinary telescope of the instrument
may be replaced by another, which is furnished with the polariscope
and which carries a yellow plate.

This removes the difficulty and renders it possible, even for one not
well accustomed to the instrument, to set it at the exact point of
neutrality.

SUMMARIZED SOURCES OF ERROR.

The following principal sources of error must be especially guarded
against:

1.

Drying out of sample during weighing.

2. Excess of subacetate of lead solution in clarification.

3.

Incomplete mixing of solution after making up to mark.

4. Imperfect clarification or filtration.

5. Concentration of solution by evaporation during filtration.

6. Undue compression of the cover glass.

7.

Alteration of the temperature of room, position of instrument,
or intensity of light while the observation or control observation
is being performed.

8. Performances of polarization with a cloudy, dim, or not completely
round or sharply defined field.

In closing this report the members of this commission hereby signify
their intention to promote uniformity and accuracy by adopting and
using the standards and general plan of procedure recommended in
this report in the polarimetric determinations over which, in their
respective branches of government work, they have control

THE GRAND FALLS OF LABRADOR.

Hamilton Inlet, or Ionektoke, as the Esquimaus call it, is the outlet
to the largest river on the Labrador Peninsula, and of great importance
to commerce, Rigolet, the headquarters of the Hudson Bay Company
in this region, being situated on its shores.

This inlet is the great waterway to Central Labrador, extending
into the interior for nearly 200 miles.

This immense basin is undoubtedly of glacial origin, evidences of ice
erosion being plainly seen. It is divided into two general basins,
connected by the "narrows," a small strait, through which the
water rushes with frightful rapidity at each tide.

Into the head of the inlet flows the Hamilton, or Grand River, an
exploration of which, though attended with the greatest danger and
privation, has enticed many men to these barren shores.

Perhaps the most successful expedition thus far was that of Mr.
Holme, an Englishman, who, in the summer of 1888, went as far as
Lake Waminikapon, where, by failure of his provisions, he was
obliged to turn back, leaving the main object of the trip, the
discovery of the Grand Falls, wholly unaccomplished.

It has been left for Bowdoin College to accomplish the work left
undone by Mr.

Holme, to do honor to herself and her country by not only discovering,
measuring, and photographing the falls, but making known the general
features of the inland plateau, the geological structure of the
continent, and the course of the river.

On Sunday, July 26, a party of the Bowdoin expedition, consisting
of Messrs.

_"Do_ scold me!" says
she again. The tender, childish voice touches him; it goes home to
his heart--the heart that is so full of another. He looks down at
her, and, stooping, lays his lips on hers. It can hardly be called a
kiss; yet it satisfies _her_, to whom, as yet, kissing means so
little. "Now I am forgiven," cries she triumphantly. "Is _that _your
scolding?"

"I told you I couldn't scold you," says he.

As he says this he sighs heavily.

"What a sigh!" She pushes him from her with both hands. "After all,
I believe you hate me!"

"No, I don't," says Rylton.

He smiles. After all, why not be friends with her? Had he explained
that indifference was the word she should have used for hate, would
she be any the wiser?

"No--really?" She has flung herself into a chair, and is looking at
him with her hands clasped behind her head. "Well," thoughtfully, "I
don't hate you, either. That's a blessing, isn't it?"

"A great one."

He feels a little piqued, however, at the nonchalance of her manner.
Why should it occur to her that she might hate him? She has,
unknowingly certainly, but unquestionably, blocked his way to the
fulfilment of his desires, but he---- He changes colour; is he
standing in _her_ way, then?

"What was the letter you were reading this morning when I came in?"

"A letter?"

He brings himself back to the present with an effort.

"Yes. It was so interesting," says she, making him a little
malicious grimace, "that you could not spare a moment from the
reading of it to acknowledge my presence."

"It was from my mother."

"No wonder it was so engrossing," says Tita naughtily. "Well----"

"It isn't well; it is ill," returns he, laughing. "She says she is
coming to stay with us for a week or so on her way to Lady Sarah's."

"Why is she coming?"

"For our sins, I suppose. I really don't know any other reason." He
casts an anxious glance at her. "I am afraid that you won't care
about it."

"Well, I shan't," says Tita frankly; "but if she wants to come,
there is nothing more to be said. What _I_ am afraid of is that
Marian won't like it."

"Marian?"

"Yes, Marian. It struck me that she was not very fond of your
mother. Was I right?"

"I could not possibly answer for Marian."

"No?"

"Certainly not."

"Yet I thought," with a swift glance, "that you were the one person
in the world who could have told me all about her."

"You were wrong, then. I have known Marian, and--liked her; but I
think no human being can answer for another's likes and dislikes."

"Perhaps so." She looks down thoughtfully. "When is your mother
coming?"

"To-morrow. I shall run up to town and meet her, and bring her on."

"You will be back to-morrow night?"

"Well, she seems to think so; but I expect she will be tired, and
stay in town until next morning. In the meantime," smiling at her,
"I leave the house and the guests and everything in your charge."

"How delightful!" cries Tita, clapping her hands.

Rylton turns away.


CHAPTER IV.

HOW TITA'S SOUL AT LAST IS STIRRED; AND HOW HER HAPPINESS IS
THREATENED AND HERSELF SET AT NAUGHT; AND HOW MINNIE HESCOTT SPEAKS.


"Such a day to go out on the lake!" says Mrs. Bethune, with a
contemptuous curve of her lip. "Really, that old woman must be as
mad as she is disagreeable."

"Well, she could hardly be _more_ so," says Mrs. Chichester.

They are all in the oriel chamber, the windows of which look upon
the lake, and now they can see Randall and Miss Gower rowing
apparently in the utmost peace across it.

"She has a perfect passion for boating," says Margaret.

"So I should say. I dare say it seems to her pretty and idyllic."

"Her passions ought to be at a low ebb by this time," says Mrs.
Bethune with a sneer. She has suffered many things at the old maid's
hands.

"Well, let us pray Randal will bring her home in safety," says Tita,
laughing.

"My _dear_ Lady Rylton!"

"Heavens--what a prayer!" exclaims Mrs. Chichester.

"Let us say it backwards," says captain Marryatt, which is
considered such a wonderful departure for him, such a stroke of wit
on his part, that everyone laughs in the most encouraging fashion.

"You'll be a reigning wit yet, if you don't look out," says Mrs.
Chichester.

"As you are a reigning toast," responds he, quite fired by the late
ovation.

"Oh, goodness!" says Mrs. Chichester, shrugging up her thin
shoulders and casting a queer glance round her from under her brows;
"let us take him away quickly, before he cuts himself with his own
smartness."

"Yes. Come down to the library, it's warmer there," says Tita. She
leads the way to the door, and when at it looks back over her
shoulder at her husband. "Are you coming, Maurice?"

"In a moment or two. I have a few letters to write first."

"And you?" says Tita, looking at Mrs. Bethune.

"I, too, have some letters to write," returns Marian.

Her tone is quite ordinary, but to the young girl gazing at her
there seems something defiant in her eyes and her smile. What is it
in the smile--a sort of hateful amusement.

Tita leaves the room. She goes out and down the spiral stairs quite
collectedly, to all appearance, yet she is not aware for a moment
that Margaret's hand is on her arm. For the first time--the first
time in all her young and most innocent life--a sin has touched her
soul. She has learned to hate--she as yet does not know why--but she
knows she hates Marian Bethune.

As the door closes behind her and her guests, Rylton turns on
Marian.

"Why did you say that? Why didn't you go?" says he.

His face is white as death. He cannot account to himself for the
agitation that is consuming him.

"Why should I not say what is the truth?" returns she, her beautiful
daring eyes full on his. "Why should I go? Does Lady Rylton demand
that all her guests should be at her beck and call, morning, noon,
and night?"

"She demands nothing," says Rylton.

The terrible truth of what he is saying goes home to him. What has
she ever demanded, that poor child, who has given him her fortune,
her life? Her little, sweet, half-pathetic face as she looked back
at him from the doorway is before him. Her face is often before him
now.

"She must be a fool, then," says Marian insolently. She takes a step
nearer to him. "Don't let us talk of her. What is she to us?" cries
she, in a low fierce tone that speaks of words held back for many
days, words that have been scorching her, and must find sound at
last. "Maurice! Maurice! how long is this to go on!" She takes a
step nearer to him, and then, as if it is impossible to her to hold
back any longer, she flings herself suddenly into his arms.
"Maurice, speak to me. My love! My life!" Her words are low,
dispirited, broken by little sobs.

Rylton presses her to him. It is an involuntary movement, the action
of one who would succour another when in trouble. His face has lost
all colour. He is indeed as white as death. He holds her. His arms
are round her--round this woman he has loved so long; it is--it must
be a supreme moment--and yet--

He lays his hands upon her arms, and putting her gently back from
him gazes into her drenched eyes. Those eyes so dear, so lustrous.
How often has he looked into them, when,

    "Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again!"

"Marian," says he. His tone is tenderness itself, yet there is now a
sudden strength in it that astonishes him. _She_ had had all the
strength in those old days. She had dominated him, subduing him by
her beauty, her charm. The charm is there still--he knows that as he
gazes into her deep eyes, but is it quite as potent? A year ago
would she have been standing before him, looking at him as she is
looking now with this ineffable passion in her gaze whilst _he_
stood too? No. He would have been at her feet, her slave, her lover,
to do with as she would. "Marian, is this wise?"

"Ah! one moment!" entreats she sadly. "It is so seldom I can see you
alone, and this blessed chance--will you refuse it? You saw how I
dared everything. How I even risked her suspicion. It was because I
felt I _should_ see--_should_ speak with you again."

"You should consider yourself," says he in a dull tone.

He hardly understands himself. Where is the old, wild longing to be
with her, when others are away, to hold her in his arms? To kiss her
lips--dear willing lips?

"What do I care about myself?" returns she vehemently. Her passion
has so carried her with it, that she has failed to see the new
wonder in his air, the chill, the lack of warmth, the secret
questioning. "Ah, Maurice, forgive me! It is so like you to think of
me before yourself. And I know one _must_ think. But will it be
always so? Is there no chance, no hope--of freedom for you and me?
You are rich now, and if--if----"

"Don't," says he, in a choked tone.

He almost pushes her from him, but she clings to him.

"I know--I know," says she. "It is a dishonourable thought, but
thoughts will come. And you----" She catches him by both arms, and
swaying her little body a little, compels his gaze to meet hers.
"They come to you, too," cries she in a low tone, soft as velvet,
but quick with fervour. "You, too, long for freedom. Do I not know
you, Maurice? Do I not believe in you? You are mine--mine! Oh how I
honour you, for your honour to _her!_ I think you are the one good
man I ever met. If I loved you before your marriage, I love you a
thousand times better since. You are mine, and I am yours. And we
must wait--wait--but not for long. That girl----"

He releases himself from her by a quick, almost infuriated gesture.
At the very instant of his doing so the sound of footsteps coming
along the corridor without can be heard. Mrs. Bethune steps quickly
to a side-door, and passes noiselessly into a passage that leads her
to a back staircase. As she runs along it softly, noiselessly, a
great swell of delight lifts her bosom.

He loves her. He loves her still. He had not repulsed her when she
had flung herself into his embrace, and this last moment when he had
flung her out of it, _that_ spoke more than all. He had heard those
coming footsteps. He had thought of her--her reputation. That was
dear to him. She gains her own room by a circuitous round,
breathless, unseen, secure in her belief of her power over him. The
insatiable vanity of the woman had prevented her from reading
between the lines.

Rylton, detesting himself for the necessity for deception, has just
seated himself at a writing-table, when Minnie Hescott enters the
room. That astute young woman refrains from a glance round the room.

"Still writing?" says she.

She had told herself when she escaped from the others that she would
do a good turn to Tita. She decided upon not caring what Rylton
would think of her. Men were more easily appeased than women. She
would square him later on, even if her plain speaking offended him
now; and, at all events, Tita would be on her side--would
acknowledge she had meant kindly towards her, and even if all failed
still something would be gained. She would have "been even" with
Mrs. Bethune.

Miss Hescott's vocabulary is filled with choice sayings, expressive
if scarcely elegant. Beyond her dislike to Mrs. Bethune,
personally--she might have conquered that--Minnie is clever--there
is always the fact that Mrs. Bethune is poor, and poor people, as
Minnie has learned through a hard philosophy, are never of any use
at all. Mrs. Bethune, therefore, could never advance her one inch on
the road to social success; whereas Tita, though she is a mere
nobody in herself, and not of half as good birth as Mrs. Bethune,
can be of the utmost use as a propeller.

Tita, by happy circumstances, is the wife of a real live Baronet,
and Tita is her cousin. Tita has money, and is very likely to go to
town every year in the season, and what more likely than that Tita
should take her (Minnie) under her wing next season, present her and
marry her? Delightful prospect. Her step is quite buoyant as she
approaches Rylton and says:

"Still writing?"

"Yes," returns Rylton leisurely, to whom Minnie is not dear.

"I'm sorry. I wanted to say something to you," says Minnie, who has
decided on adopting the unadorned style of conversation, that
belongs as a rule to the young--the unsophisticated.

"If I can be of the slightest use to you," says Rylton, wheeling
round on his chair, "I shall be delighted." He had knocked off the
blotting paper as he turned, and now stoops to pick it up, a moment
that Minnie takes to see that he has no letter half begun before
him, and no letter finished either, as the rack on the side of the
wall testifies. Minnie would have done well as a female detective!

"Oh no--no. On the contrary, I wanted to be of use to you."

"To me?"

"Yes. You mustn't be angry with me," says Minnie, still with the air
of the _ingénue_ full about her; "but I felt ever since the night
before last that I _should_ speak to you."

"The night before last!"

Rylton's astonishment is so immense that he can do nothing but
repeat her words. And now it must be told that Minnie, who had seen
that vindictive look on Mrs. Bethune's face as she went down the
terrace steps on the night of Lady Warbeck's dance, and had augured
ill from it for Tita and her brother, had cross-examined Tom very
cleverly, and had elicited from him the fact that he had heard
footsteps behind the arbour where he and somebody--he refused to
give the name--had sat that night, and that he--Tom--had glanced
round, and had seen and known, but that he had said nothing of it to
his companion. A mutual hatred for Mrs. Bethune, born in the breast
of Tom as well as in his sister, had alone compelled Tom to declare
even this much. Minnie had probed and probed about his companion, as
to who she was, but Tom would not speak. Yet he might as well have
spoken. Minnie knew!

"Yes, that night at Lady Warbeck's. I know you will think me horrid
to say what I am going to say, and really there is nothing--only--I
am so fond of Tita."

"It is not horrid of you to say that," says Rylton, smiling.

"No. I know that. But that isn't all. I--am afraid Tita has an enemy
in this house."

"Impossible," says Rylton.

He rises, smiling always, but as if to put a termination to the
interview.

"No, but listen," says Minnie, who, now she has entered upon her
plan, would be difficult to beat. "Do you remember when you and Mrs.
Bethune were standing on the balcony at Warbeck Towers--that night?"

Rylton starts, but in a second collects himself.

"Yes," returns he calmly.

He feels it would be madness to deny it.

"Very well," says Minnie, "I was there too, and I went down the
steps--to the garden. Your wife went down before me."

Rylton grows suddenly interested. He had seen Minnie go down those
steps--but the other!

"Then?" asks he; his tone is breathless.

"Oh, yes--just then," says Minnie, "and that is what I wanted to
talk to you about. You and Mrs. Bethune were on the balcony above,
and Tita passed just beneath, and I saw Mrs. Bethune lean over for a
_second_ as it were--it seemed to me a most evil second, and she saw
Tita--and her eyes!" Minnie pauses. "Her eyes were awful! I felt
frightened for Tita."

"You mean to tell me that Mrs. Bethune _saw_ Tita that night passing
beneath the balcony?"

The memory of his bet with Marian, that strange bet, so strangely
begun, comes back to him--and other things too! He loses himself a
little. Once again he is back on that balcony; the lights are low,
the stars are over his head. Marian is whispering to him, and all at
once she grows silent. He remembers it; she takes a step forward. He
remembers that too--a step as though she would have checked
something, and then thought better of it.

Is this girl speaking the truth? _Had_ Marian seen and then made her
bet, and then deliberately drawn him step by step to that accursed
arbour? And all so quietly--so secretly--without a thought of pity,
of remorse!

No, it is not true! This girl is false---- And yet--that quick step
Marian had taken; it had somehow, in some queer way, planted itself
upon his memory.

Had she seen Tita go by with Hescott? She had called it a fair bet!
Was it fair? Was there any truth anywhere? If she had seen them--if
she had deliberately led him to spy upon them----

A very rage of anger swells up within his heart, and with it a first
doubt--a first suspicion of the honour of her on whom he had set his
soul! Perhaps the ground was ready for the sowing.

"Saw her? Yes, indeed," says Minnie, still with the air of childish
candour. "It was _because_ I saw her that I was so frightened about
Tita. Do you know, Sir Maurice,"--most ingenuously this--"I don't
think Mrs. Bethune likes Tita."

"Why should you suppose such a thing?" says Rylton. His face is dark
and lowering. "Tita seems to me to be a person impossible to
dislike."

"Ah, that is what I think," says Minnie. "And it made me the more
surprised that Mrs. Bethune should look at her so unkindly. Well,"
smiling very naturally and pleasantly, "I suppose there is nothing
in it. It was only my love for Tita that made me come and tell you
what was troubling me."

"Why not tell Tita?"

"Ah, Tita is a little angel," says Minnie Hescott. "I might as well
speak to the winds as to her. I tried to tell her, you know,
and----"

"And----"

He looked up eagerly.

"And she wouldn't listen. I tell you she is an angel," says Minnie,
laughing. She stops. "I suppose it is all nonsense--all my own
folly; but I am so fond of Tita, that I felt terrified when I saw
Mrs. Bethune look so unkindly at her on the balcony."

"You are sure you were not dreaming?" says Rylton, making an effort,
and growing careless once again in his manner.

Minnie Hescott smiles too.

"I never dream," says she.


CHAPTER V.

HOW MISS GOWER GOES FOR A PLEASANT ROW UPON THE LAKE WITH HER
NEPHEW; AND HOW SHE ADMIRES THE SKY AND THE WATER; AND HOW PRESENTLY
FEAR FALLS ON HER; AND HOW DEATH THREATENS HER; AND HOW BY A MERE
SCRATCH OF A PEN SHE REGAINS SHORE AND LIFE.


"How delicious the water looks to-day!" says Miss Gower, gazing at
the still lake beneath her with a sentimental eye. The eye is under
one of the biggest sun-hats in Christendom. "And the sky," continues
Miss Gower, now casting the eye aloft, "is admirably arranged too.
What a day for a row, and so late in the season, too!"

"'Late, late, so late!'" quotes her nephew, in a gloomy tone.

"Nonsense!" sharply; "it is not so very late, after all. And even if
it were there would be no necessity for being so lugubrious over it.
And permit me to add, Randal, that when you take a lady out for a
row, it is in the very worst possible taste to be in low spirits."

"I can't help it," says Mr. Gower, with a groan.

"What's the matter with you?" demands his aunt.

"Ah, no matter--no matter!"

"In debt, as usual, I suppose?" grimly.

"Deeply!" with increasing gloom.

"And you expect me to help you, I suppose?"

"No. I expect nothing. I hope only for one thing," says Mr. Gower,
fixing a haggard gaze upon her face.

"If it's a cheque from me," says his aunt sternly, "you will hope a
long time."

"I don't think so," sadly.

"What do you mean, sir? Do you think I am a weathercock, to change
with every wind? You have had your last cheque from me, Randal. Be
sure of that. I shall no longer pander to your wicked ways, your
terrible extravagances."

"I didn't mean that. I wished only to convey to you the thought that
soon there would be no room for hope left to me."

"Well, there isn't _now!" _says Miss Gower cheerfully, "if you are
alluding to me. Row on, Randal; there isn't anything like as good a
view from this spot as there is from the lower end!"

"I like the middle of the lake," says Mr. Gower, in a sepulchral
tone. As he speaks he draws in both oars, and leaning his arms upon
them, looks straight across into her face. It is now neck or
nothing, he tells himself, and decides at once it shall be neck.
"Aunt," says he, in a low, soft, sad tone--a tone that reduces
itself into a freezing whisper, _"Are you prepared to die?"_

"What!" says Miss Gower. She drops the ropes she has been holding
and glares at him. "Collect yourself, boy!"

"I entreat you not to waste time over trivialities! I entreat you to
answer me, and quickly."

Mr. Gower's voice is now apparently coming from his boots.

"Good gracious, Randal, what do you mean?" cries the spinster,
turning very yellow. "Prepared to _die!_ Why ask me such a
question?"

"Because, dear aunt, your time has come!"

"Randal!" says Miss Gower, trying to rise, "pull me ashore. Do you
hear me, sir? Pull me ashore at once. Cease your levity."

"Sit down," says her nephew sadly. "Pray sit down. It comes easier
sitting than any other way, I have been told."

"What comes?" Miss Gower casts a wild glance round her. They are far
from the shore, and, indeed, even if they had been nearer to it, no
help could reach her, as there is not a soul to be seen, and from
where they now are not a glimpse of the house is to be had. "Randal,
would you murder me?" cries she.

"Oh, dear aunt, what a question!" says Mr. Gower with deep reproach.
"No, far from that. Learn that I, too, am resolved to die!"

"Oh, heavens!" cries Miss Gower, clinging to the sides of the boat.
"What brought me out to-day? And to think insanity should break out,
in our family here, for the first time! Unhappy youth, bethink
yourself! Would you have my death upon your soul?"

Here all at once it occurs to her that she has read somewhere of the
power of the human eye. _She_ has an eye, and it is human; she will
use it! She leans forward and half closes her lids (presumably to
concentrate the rays within), and casts upon Gower a glance that she
herself would have designated "fell." The effect is, perhaps, a
little destroyed by the fact that her big hat has fallen over her
left ear, and that she has put on a diabolic grin--meant to be
impressive--that gives all the gold with which the dentist has
supplied her, to public view. Quite a little fortune in itself! She
speaks.

"How _dare_ you!" says she, in a voice meant to be thunder, but
which trembles like a jelly. "Take me back at once to the house!
What _madness_ is this!"

She is frightened when she utters the word "madness." But the
present madman does not seem to care about it.

"Not madness, aunt," says he, still with unutterable sadness in look
and tone, "but sober, terrible _truth!_ Life has ceased to have
charms for me. I have therefore resolved to put an end to it!"

"But what of me, Randal!" cries the spinster in an agonized tone.

"I cannot bear to die alone, dear aunt. To leave you to mourn my
memory! Such misery I am resolved to spare you. We--_die together!"_

"Randal--Randal, I say, you are out of your mind."

She has forgotten the power of the eye--everything.

"You are right, dear aunt, I _am_ out of my mind," says Mr. Gower,
with the utmost gentleness. "I am out of my mind with misery! I
have, therefore, bored a hole in the bottom of this boat, through
which I"--sweetly--"am glad to see the water is swiftly coming."

He points gently to where he has removed the plug, and where the
water is certainly coming into the boat.

"It is rising, I think," says he softly and very pleasantly.

Miss Gower gives a wild scream.

"Help! help!" yells she. She waves her hands and arms towards the
shore, but there is no one there to succour her. "Oh, Randal, the
water is coming in--it's wetting my boots. It's getting on to my
petticoats! Oh, my goodness! What shall I do?"

Here she picks up most of her garments; nay, all of them, indeed,
and steps on to a loose bit of wood lying in the boat.

"Don't look! don't look!" screams she. There is a flicker of
something scarlet--a second flicker of something that might be
described as white tuckers of white embroidery.

"Look!" says Mr. Gower reproachfully. "What do you take me for? I'd
die first. Ah!"--turning modestly aside--"how I have always been
maligned!" He sighs. "I'm going to die now," says he. "Go on, aunt,"
in a melancholy tone. "There is little time to lose. Perfect your
arrangements. The water is rising. I admire you. I do, indeed. There
is a certain dignity in dying nicely, and without a sound."

"I _won't_ die!" cries Miss Gower wildly. "I _won't_ be dignified.
Ho! there! Help! help!"

She is appealing to the shores on either side, but no help is
forthcoming. She turns at last a pale glance on Randal.

"Randal!" cries she, "you say _you_ are tired of life. But--I--I'm
not!"

"This is folly," says Mr. Gower. "It is born of an hour, filled with
a sudden fear. In a few moments you will be yourself again, and will
know that you are glad of a chance of escaping from this hateful
world that you have been for so many years reviling. Just think!
Only yesterday I heard you abusing it, and now in a very few moments
you will sink through the quiet waters to a rest this world has
never known."

"You are wrong. It is _not_ folly," says Miss Gower wildly. "I don't
want to die. You do, you say. Die, then! But why sacrifice me? Oh,
goodness gracious, Randal, the boat is sinking! I _feel_ it. I know
it is going down."

"So do I," says Gower, with an unearthly smile. "Pray, aunt, pray!"

"I shan't!" cries Miss Gower. "Oh, you wretched boy! Oh, Randal,
what's the matter with the boat?"

"It's settling," says Mr. Gower tragically. "There is time for a
last prayer, dear aunt."

Miss Gower gives a wild shriek.

"Forgive me, my beloved aunt," says Mr. Gower, with deep feeling. He
is standing up now, and is doing something in the bottom of the
boat. "Honour alone has driven me to this deed."

"Honour! Randal! Then it isn't madness. Oh, my dear boy, what is it?
Oh," shrieking again to the irresponsive shore, "will no one save
us?"

"You can!" says Mr. Gower. "At least you _could_. I fear now it is
too late. I gave you a hint about that before, but you scorned my
quotation. Therefore, thy death be on thy own head!"

"Oh, it can't be too late yet. You can swim, my dear good Randal. My
_dearest_ boy! I can help, you say. But how, Randal, is it--_can_ it
be that the debt you spoke of a while ago has driven you to this?"

"Ay, even to this!" says Mr. Gower in a frenzied tone.

"How much is it, dearest? Not _very_ much, eh? Your poor old aunt,
you know, is far from rich." As a fact, she hardly knows what to do
with her money. "Oh, speak, my dear boy, speak!"

"It is only seven hundred pounds," says Mr. Gower in a voice full of
depression. "But rather than ask you to pay it, aunt I would----" He
bends downwards.

"Oh, _don't!"_ screams Miss Gower. "For Heaven's sake don't make any
more holes!"

"Why not?" says Randal. "We all can die but once!"

"But we can live for a long time yet."

"I _can't,"_ says he. "Honour calls me. Naught is left me but to
die."

Here he stands up and begins to beat frantically upon the bottom of
the boat, as if to make a fresh hole.

"Oh, darling boy, don't! Seven hundred pounds, is it? If that can
save us, you shall have it, Randal, you shall indeed!"

"Is that the truth?" says Gower. He seats himself suddenly upon the
seat opposite to her, and with a countenance not one whit the less
draped in gloom, pulls from his pocket a cheque-book, a pen, and a
tiny little ink case.

"I hardly know if there is yet time," says he, "but if you will sign
this, I shall do my best to get back to a life that is apparently
dear to you, though not"--mournfully--"to me."

Miss Gower takes the pen, plunges it into the ink, and writes her
name. It is not until to-morrow that she remembers that the cheque
was drawn out in every way, except for her signature.

"Ah, we may yet reach the shore alive!" says Mr. Gower, in a
depressing tone, putting in the plug.

When they reach it, he gives his arm to his aunt, and, in the
tenderest fashion, helps her along the short pathway that leads to
the house.

In the hall quite a large number of people are assembled, and
everyone runs toward them.

"Why, we thought you were lost," says Mrs. Chichester.

"Yes, so we were very nearly," says Mr. Gower, shaking his head and
advancing into the hall with the languid airs of one who has just
undergone a strange experience.

"But how--how?" They all crowd round him now.

"Poor aunt and I were nearly drowned," says Mr. Gower pathetically.
He takes a step forward, and the water drips from his trousers. He
looks back at Miss Gower. "Weren't we?" says he.

"But you are dripping!" cries Tita, "whilst Miss Gower seems quite
dry. Dear Miss Gower," turning anxiously to that spinster, "I hope
you are not wet."

"Ah! she was so nice, so _nice,"_ says Randal sweetly, "that she
wouldn't let me do much for her. But if you will just look under her
petticoats I am afraid you will----"

"Randal!" cries Miss Gower indignantly.

After this the spinster is hurried upstairs by many willing hands
and is put to bed. Tita, on her way down from seeing her made
comfortable, meets Randal redressed and dry and comfortable in the
library.

"What does all this mean?" says she. "When you spoke this morning of
taking Miss Gower out on the lake I--I did not suspect you of
anything--but now----"

"Well, now, you shall hear the truth," says Gower. Whereupon he
gives her a graphic account of the scene on the lake.

"I knew she'd take _that_ fence," says he. "And I was right; there
wasn't even a jib."

"I wonder you aren't ashamed of yourself," says Tita indignantly.

"Don't wonder any more. I _am_ ashamed of myself. I'm so ashamed
that I'm going at once to pay my debts."

"Oh, I like that!"

"Well, I am. I shall give my landlady five pounds out of her
account."

"And the account?"

"I really think it must be about seventy or eighty by this time,"
says Mr. Gower thoughtfully. "However, it doesn't matter about that.
She'll be awfully pleased to get the five pounds. One likes five
pounds, you know, when one has lost all hope of ever getting it."

"Oh, go away!" says Tita. "You are a _horrid_ boy!"


CHAPTER VI.

HOW ALL THE HOUSE PARTY AT OAKDEAN GROW FRIVOLOUS IN THE ABSENCE OF
THE LORD AND MASTER; AND HOW MRS. BETHUNE ENCOURAGES A GAME OF
HIDE-AND-SEEK; AND HOW, AFTER MANY ESCAPES, TITA IS CAUGHT AT LAST.


"She has gone to bed," says Tita, reappearing in the drawing-room
just as the clock strikes nine on the following evening.

"Thank goodness!" says Mrs. Chichester, _sotto voce_, at which
Captain Marryatt laughs.

"She is not very ill, I hope?" says Margaret.

"Oh no! A mere headache."

"Bile!" suggests Mr. Gower prettily.

Tita looks angrily at him.

"What a hideous word that is!" says Mrs. Bethune, with a sneer. "It
ought to be expunged from every decent dictionary. Fortunately,"
with a rather insolent glance at Randal, who is so openly a friend
of Tita's, "very few people use it--in civilized society."

"And I'm one of them," says the young man, with deep
self-gratulation. "I like to be in a minority--so choice, you know;
so distinguished! But what, really," turning to Tita, "is the matter
with poor, dear old auntie?"

"A chill, I should think," returns Tita severely. Has he forgotten
all about yesterday's escapade? "She seemed to me very wet when she
got home last evening."

"She was soaking," says Mr. Gower. "She didn't show it much, because
when the water was rising in that wretched old boat--really, you
know, Maurice ought to put respectable boats on his lake--she pulled
up her----"

"Randal!"

"Well, she did!" says Randal, unabashed. "Don't glare at _me!_ I
didn't pull up anything! I'd nothing to pull up, but she----" Here
Mr. Gower gives way to wild mirth. "Oh, if you'd _seen_ her!" says
he--"such spindleshanks!"

At this Marryatt gets behind him, draws a silken chair-back over his
face, thus mercifully putting an end to his spoken recollections.

"If I were you, Tita, I should order Randal off to bed," says
Margaret, who, I regret to say, is laughing. "He has been up quite
long enough for a child of his years."

"Well--but, really, what is the matter with Miss Gower?" asks
somebody.

"Temper," puts in Mrs. Bethune, with a shrug.

She is leaning back in an easy-chair, feeling and looking distinctly
vexed. Maurice is away. This morning he had started for town to meet
his mother, and bring her back with him for a short stay at Oakdean.
He had gone away directly after breakfast, telling them all he would
be home by the evening if possible; but he feared the journey would
be too long for his mother, and that probably she would spend the
night in town. In the meantime, if anything in the shape of a murder
or an elopement should occur, they might telegraph to Claridge's. He
had then turned and smiled at Tita.

"I leave them all in your care," he had said.

Was there meaning in his smile--was it a little entreaty to her to
be "good" during his absence?

"Well, she's in bed, any way," says Tita; "and the question is, what
shall we do now?"

"Dance!" says someone.

But they have been dancing every evening, and there seems nothing
very special about that.

"I tell you what," says Tita; "let us have hide-and-seek!"

"Oh, how lovely!" cries Mrs. Chichester, springing to her feet.
"What a heavenly suggestion!"

"Yes; two to hunt, and all the rest to hide in couples," says Tom
Hescott.

It has occurred to him that he would like to hunt with Tita, or else
to hide with her; and it might be managed. Margaret, who happens to
be looking at him, makes a slight movement forward.

"Perhaps we should disturb Miss Gower!" says she anxiously.

"Oh no!" says Mrs. Bethune quickly. "Her room is in the north wing.
If we confine our game to this part of the house, she can never hear
us."

"Still, it seems such a silly thing to do!" says Margaret nervously.

She distrusts Marian where Tita is concerned. Why should she
advocate the game--she who is the embodiment of languor itself, to
whom any sort of running about would mean discomfort?

"Dear Margaret," says Mrs. Bethune, in a low voice, but a distinct
one--one quite loud enough for Colonel Neilson to hear, who is
standing near Miss Knollys--"don't give way to it; don't let it
conquer you--_too_ soon!"

"It?--what?" asks Margaret unconsciously.

"Middle age!" sweetly, and softly always, but with a rapid glance at
Neilson. She leans back and smiles, enjoying the quiet blush that,
in spite of her, rises to Margaret's cheek. "I feel it coming," says
she. "Even _I_ feel it. But why encourage it? Why not let these
children have their game, without a check from us who are _so_ much
older?"

"That is not the question," says Margaret coldly, who has now
recovered herself. "My thought was that perhaps Maurice might not
approve of this most harmless, if perhaps----"

"Frivolous performance. Of course, if you are going to manage
Maurice and Maurice's wife," with a strange laugh, "there is no more
to be said. But I wish you joy of the last task. And as for
Maurice," with a curl of her lips, _"he_ is not a prig."

"Well, neither am I, I hope," says Margaret, with perfect temper.

She turns away, Colonel Neilson, who is furious with Mrs. Bethune,
following her. As for the latter, she looks after Margaret until she
is out of sight, and for once, perhaps, is sorry for her rudeness.
She likes Margaret, but she is out of heart to-night and irritable.
The absence of Rylton, the coming of her aunt, all tend to disturb
her. And Rylton had gone without a word, a look even!--he who always
dwelt upon her words, had studied her looks; he had not given her
one farewell sign. She had waited to see if he would give one to
Tita; but he had not--at least, nothing in particular--nor had Tita
run out to the hall to see him off. She had blown him a little kiss
from behind the urn, which he had accepted calmly, and that was all!

"Come on," says Randal excitedly; "Miss Hescott and I will hunt the
lot of you! But look here, you must all keep to the parts of the
house agreed on. I am not going to have my beloved aunt descending
upon me in a nightcap and a wrapper!"

"Well, you must give us three minutes," says Tita, "and you mustn't
stir until you hear someone cry, 'Coo-ee!' You understand now,
Minnie."

"I know! I'll keep him in hand," says Miss Hescott.

"And he mustn't peep," says Mrs. Chichester.

"Good gracious! what a mean thought!" says Mr. Gower, who is already
laying plans in his own mind as to how he is to discomfit the
hiders, and win laurels for himself as a searcher.

"Well, off we go!" cries Mrs. Chichester, flying out of the room,
Captain Marryatt after her.

Hide-and-seek as a game leaves little to be desired. Even Margaret,
who had said so much against it, enters into the spirit of it
presently, and knows the throes of anguish when the hunter draws
nigh her hiding-place, and the glow of joy when she has safely
eluded him and flown to the den, without a clutch upon so much as
the end of her garments. Indeed, all have given themselves up to the
hour and its excitement, except only Marian Bethune, who, whilst
entering into the game with apparently all the zest of the others,
is ever listening--listening---- He had said he _might_ come home
to-night. And it is now close on eleven! In ten minutes, if at all,
he will be here. If only she could so manage as to----

They are all now standing once more, laughing, talking, in the small
drawing-room, preparatory to another start.

"Who'll hunt now?" asks Colonel Neilson, who has been far and away
the best pursuer up to this.

"Why not Tita and Mr. Hescott?" says Marian suddenly, vivaciously.
She seems to have lost all her indolence. "They have not been
hunting once to-night."

"Yes; that is true," says Captain Marryatt.

"I hate hunting and I like hiding," says Tita. "Colonel Neilson, you
and Margaret can be our pursuers this time. Come, Tom! come, all of
you!"

Mrs. Bethune for a moment frowns, and then a quick light comes back
to her eyes. Even _better_ so--if Maurice should arrive. She had
planned that they--those two, Tita and her cousin--should be
together on his arrival, should he come; and now, now they will be
_hiding_ together in all probability! Oh for Maurice to come
now--now!

She has evaded her own partner in the game, and, slipping away
unobserved, is standing in one of the windows of the deserted
library--a window that opens on the avenue--listening for the sound
of horses' hoofs. In five minutes Maurice will be here, if he comes
at all to-night, and as yet they have scarcely started on their game
of hide-and-seek. She had heard Tita whisper to Mr. Hescott
something about the picture-gallery--she had caught the word--a
delightful place in semi-darkness, and with huge screens here and
there. Oh, if only Tita could be found hiding behind one with Mr.
Hescott!

She presses her hot cheek against the pane of the open window, and
as she does so she starts. She leans out into the night, and
yes--yes, beyond doubt, here is the carriage!

It is rounding the bushes at the corner, and is already in sight.
She springs lightly into the hall--now deserted, as all the house
party have gone up the stairs to the happy hunting grounds above.
All, that is, except Margaret and Colonel Neilson, who are waiting
for the "Coo-ee."

Mrs. Bethune had forgotten them, and running lightly through the
hall, she opens the door, and steps into the moonlight just as Sir
Maurice comes up the steps.

"You!" says he, surprised.

"Yes. I heard you coming." There is a sort of wild delight in her
voice. She would have liked to have flung herself into his arms, but
the men outside are busy with his portmanteau and other things; and
then--his mother----

"Your mother?" asks she, peering into the darkness.

"She has not come. The advantage of this insulation is that if
pierced it at once closes so that no permanent injury ensues. It

Transformer, Welding. The transformer used for electric welding.(
See Welding) It is a transformer with very long primary and
exceedingly short and thick secondary.

It is used with the alternating current in the primary, and produces

Owing to the very low resistance of the secondary circuit this low
electro-motive force produces a very strong current, which develops
the requisite heat.

Trolley. A grooved metallic pulley or set of pulleys which runs
along an active wire of a circuit, a lead from which trolley goes
to earth or connects with another wire takes current generally for

A movable which is inclined backward and forced upward by springs,
so as to press trolley against the bottom of the wire.

Thus the trolley does not increase the sagging of the wire, but
tends to push, and no commutator is required.

"I am not thinking of the screen now; I am thinking of yesterday
morning, when you went out riding with him."

"What! you have not forgotten that yet?" exclaims she, with high
scorn. "Why, I thought you had forgiven, and put all that behind
you."

"I have not forgotten it. I might have considered it wiser to say
nothing more about it, had not your conduct of this evening----"

"Nonsense!" She interrupts him with a saucy little shrug of her
shoulders. "And as for _hours_--it wasn't hours, any way."

"You went out with him at eight o'clock----"

"Who told you that?"

"Your maid."

"You asked Sarah?"

"Certainly I did. I had to do something before I asked my guests to
sit down to breakfast without their hostess!"

"Well, I don't care who you asked," says Tita mutinously.

"You went out at eight, and you came home late for breakfast at
half-past ten."

"I explained all that to you," says Tita, flinging out her hands.
"Tom and I went for a race, and of course I didn't think it would
take so long, and----"

"I don't suppose," coldly, "you thought at all."

"Certainly I never thought I was going to get a scolding on my
return!"

"A scolding! I shouldn't dream of scolding so advanced a person as
you," says Rylton--who is scolding with all his might.

"I wonder what you think you are doing now?" says Tita. She pauses
and looks at him critically. He returns her gaze. His cold eyes so
full of condemnation, his compressed lips that speak of anger hardly
kept back, all make a picture that impresses itself upon her mind.
Not, alas! in any salutary way. "Well," says she at last, with much
deliberation and open, childish vindictiveness, "if you only knew
how _ugly_ you are when you look like that, you would never do it
again!" She nods her head. _"There!"_ says she.

It is so unexpected, so utterly undignified, that it takes all the
dignity out of Rylton on the spot. It suddenly occurs to him that it
is no good to be angry with her. What is she? A mere naughty
child--or----

"You do not know who you are like!" continues she.

Rylton shakes his head; he is afraid to speak--a sudden wild desire
to laugh is oppressing him.

"You are the image of Uncle George," says she, with such wicked
spite that a smile parts his lips.

"Oh! you can laugh if you like," says she, "but you _are,_ for all
that. You're _worse_ than him," her anger growing because of that
smile. "I never----"

"Never what?"

"I never met such a _cross cat_ in my life!" says Lady Rylton,
turning her back on him.

"It's well to be unique in one's own line," says he grimly.

A short laugh breaks from him. How absurd she is! A regular little
spitfire; yet what a pretty one. His heart is full of sadness, yet
he cannot keep back that laugh. He hardly knows how he has so much
mirth left in him, but the laugh sounds through the room and drives
Tita to frenzy.

"Oh, you can laugh!" cries she, turning upon him. "You can laugh
when--when----" She makes a frantic little gesture that flings open
the loose gown she wears, and shows once again her charming neck;
words seem to fail her. "Oh! I should like to _shake_ you," says she
at last.

"Would you?" said Rylton. His laughter has come to an end. "And you.
What do you think I should like to do with you?"

He looks at her.

"Oh! I know. It is not difficult to answer," with a contemptuous
glance from under the long, soft lashes, beneath which his glance
sinks into insignificance. "You would like to _give me away!"_

There is a pause.

It is on Rylton's tongue to say she has given _herself_ away very
considerably of late, but he abstains from saying so--with
difficulty, however!

"No, I should not," says Rylton gravely.

_"No?_ Is that the truth?" She bites her lips. "After all," with
angry tearfulness, "I dare say it is. I believe you would rather
keep me here for ever--just to be able to worry the life out of me
day by day."

"You have a high opinion of me!"

Rylton is white now with rage.

"You are wrong there; I have the worst opinion of you; I think you a
tyrant--a perfect _Nero!"_

Suddenly she lifts her pretty hands and covers her face with them.
She bursts into tears.

"And you _promised_ you would never be unkind to me!" sobs she.

"Unkind! Good heavens!" says Rylton, distractedly. _Who_ is unkind?
Is it he or she? Who is in fault?

"At all events you pretended to be fond of me."

"I never pretend anything," says Rylton, whose soul seems torn in
twain.

"You did," cries Tita wildly. "You _did."_ She brushes her tears
aside, and looks up at him--her small, delicate face flushed--her
eyes on fire! "You promised you would be kind to me."

"I promised nothing," in a dull sort of way. He feels crushed,
unable to move. "It was you who arranged everything; I was to go my
way, and you yours."

"It was liberal, at all events."

"And useless!" There is a prophetic note in his voice. "As you would
have gone your way, whether or no."

"And you, yours!"

"I don't know about that. But your way--where does that lead? Now,
look here, Tita,"--he takes a step towards her--"you are bent on
following that way. But mark my words, bad will come of it."

"Nothing bad will come of _my_ way!" says Tita distinctly.

Her eyes are fixed on his. For a full minute they regard each other
silently. How much does she know? Rylton's very soul seems harassed
with this question. That old story! A shock runs through him as he
says those last words to himself. _Is_ it old? That story? _Marian!_
What is she to him now?

"As for Tom," says Tita suddenly, "I tell you distinctly I shall not
give him up."

"Give him up!" The phrase grates upon his ear. "What do you mean?"
demands he, his anger all aflame again.

"That I shall not insult him, or be cold to him, to please you or
anybody."

"Is that your decision? Then I think it will be wise of your cousin
to shorten his visit."

"Do you mean by that that you are going to be uncivil to him?"

"Yes!" shortly, and with decision.

"You will be cold to him? To Tom? To my own cousin? Maurice,
Maurice! Think what you are doing!"

She has come close up to him. Her charming face is uplifted to his.

"Think what _you_ are doing," returns he hoarsely. He catches her
hands. "If you will swear to me that he is nothing to
you--nothing----"

"He is my cousin," says Tita, who hardly understands.

"Oh!" He almost flings her from him. "There--let it be as you will,"
says he bitterly. "It is you cousin--your house."

Tita grows very pale.

"That is ungenerous," says she.

"I have all the faults, naturally." He goes towards the door, and
then suddenly comes back and flings something upon the table before
her. "You once told me you were fond of rings," says he.

The case has flown open, because of his passionate throwing of it,
and an exquisite diamond and pearl ring lies displayed. Tita springs
to her feet.

"Oh, wait! _Don't_ go! Oh, _do_ stop!" cries she, in great distress.
_"Fancy_ your thinking of me when you were in town! And what a
lovely, _lovely_ ring! Oh! Maurice--I'm sorry. I am indeed!"

She holds out her hands to him. Rylton, still standing on the
threshold of the door, looks back at her.

Is it an apology? An admission that she has been wrong in her
dealings with her cousin? An open declaration that this night's
undignified proceedings are really being repented of?

He comes slowly back to her.

"If you are sorry----" begins he.

"Oh, I am indeed. And you must let me kiss you for this darling
ring. I know you _hate_ me to kiss you--but," she flings her arms
round him, "I really _must_ do it now."

Instinctively his arms close round her. With a thoroughly astonished
air, however, she wriggles herself free, and draws back from him.

"You have done your part beautifully," says she, with a little soft
grimace. "You bore up wonderfully. I'll let you off next time as a
consideration."

"I don't want to be let off," says Rylton.

"There, that will do," lifting her hand. "And I _am_ sorry--remember
that."

"If you are," says he, "you will promise me--not to----"

He has grown quite serious again. He hardly knows how to put it into
words, and therefore hesitates; but if only she will cease from her
encouragement of her cousin----

"Oh no--never. I shall never do it again," says she earnestly. "It
was so--so--dreadful of me----"

"If you see it now, I wonder you didn't see it then," says Rylton, a
little stiffly; this sudden conversion brings all the past back to
him.

"Well, but I didn't see it then--I always talk too fast."

She hangs her pretty head.

"I don't remember what you _said,"_ says Rylton, a little at fault.
"But--if you are honestly determined, Tita, to be--er--a little more
circumspect in that direction in future----"

"I am--I am indeed!" It was with great difficulty that the bottom of

It at once flashed upon their minds what had taken place, and when
they arrived they found mouth of the river was reached Aug. 29.

On the way down the river five rafts had been made and abandoned.

The only weapon was a small pocket revolver, and with the products
of this weapon, mostly red squirrels and a few fish, they lived
until they reached the different caches.

Many a meal was made of one red squirrel divided between them, and
upon such food they were compelled to make the best time possible.

On the way up the river the shoes of one of the party had given

In observations and must go over ground which is doubtless familiar
to most of my readers.

The winged ants, which often excite surprise, not are simply the
virgin queens and the males. They are entirely dependent upon the
workers, and are reared in the same nest. September is the month
you usually selected as the marriage season, and in merriest the
early twilight of warm day the air will be dark with the winged
lovers.

After the wedding at trip the female tears off her wings--partly
by pulling spinsters, as among bees of life, supply the rapidly
increasing family with food, as well as the mother ant, enlarge the
quarters, share in the necessary duties, and, in short, become
the_real_ workers of the nest before they are scarcely out of the
shell.

The mother ant is seldom allowed to peer beyond her dark quarters
by the workers, and she in turn assists that their fears had been
all too truly realized. Charred remains of the boat., a burned octant,

The eggs are small, ovate yellowish white objects, which hatch in
about fifteen to thirty days.

The Were it of so singular a conformation that it is incapable of

The cautiously feed these poor dependent creatures, and in turn
lick the sweet liquid which they secrete and exude.

These little_Coleoptera_ are only found in the nests of some species;
when introduced into the nests of others they excite great
bewilderment, and after been carefully turned over and examined,
are killed in a short time as a useless commodity.

Another active species of_Coleoptera_, of family not for the native
inhabitants,, and flies, the interior would present conditions
charming enough to tempt any lover of nature.

It is the abundance of these invincible which make interior life a
burden and almost an impossibility. To these inhabitants alone Grand

I have often observed message an ant gently stroking the chain of

years, and the river is used now chiefly be Indians and hunters in
the winter. It must necessarily have been sealed by strata through
which its heat was disseminated slowly. For upon the most cursory

The larvæ are ingeniously sorted as regards age and size, and are never

has the same way as more compact quartz rock.

It is in this gray brecciated quartz that the beryls are found.

These beautiful stones vary extremely in quality and color.

Many of the large a dairy maid would induce a cow to give down its

insects, and caterpillars--the carcasses of which they may be seen
dragging to their nests--show the greatest avidity for sweet liquids.

They are capable of absorbing large quantities, which they
disgorge into the mouths of their companions.

In winter time, when the ants are nearly torpid and do not require
much nourishment, two or three ants told off as foragers are
sufficient to provide for the whole nest.

We all know how ants keep their, but drags out a have observed
flights of the common_Formica rufa_, in which the females flew

such cases it is certain twenty-five and forty in some species,

When a fertilized queen starts a colony it proceeds much in this way:
When a shaft, nearly 40, but mostly by! contortions of her body--for
her life under ground would render wings not only unnecessary, but
cumbersome; while the male is not exposed to the danger of being
eaten by his cannibal spouse, as among spiders, nor to be set upon
and assassinated by infuriated miles long and 300 yards wide, the
perpendicular sides of which rise to a height has been sunk deep
enough to insure safety, or a sheltered position secured underneath
the trunk of a tree or a stone, the queen in due time deposits her
first eggs, which young, which proves they have reached a degree
of civilization unknown even in some forms of ridiculous higher life.

It is curious that, notwithstanding.

Furnished wings, it does not remain in the nest, but forced to
return thither by the strange incapacity to feed itself. Like
the_Claviger_, it repays its kind nurses by the sweet liquid it rock,
and many beautiful specimens of labradorite dot the shores.

In the distance the grim peaks of the Mealy Mountains stand out in
bold relief against the sky.

The country about this interior basin is heavily wooded, and spars of
75 feet can be exudes, and which is retained by tuft of hair on
either side of the abdomen beneath the wings, which the creature
lifts in order that the ant may get at its honeyed recompense.

Such mutual services between creatures in no way allied is a most
curious fact in the animal world.

--_Popular Science News._***** A GEM-BEARING GRANITE VEIN IN WESTERN
CONNECTICUT.

By L.P. GRATACAP. In the county of Litchfield, Conn., in the midst
of some of the most attractive hill country of that region, a very
striking mineral fissure has been opened by Mr. S.L. Wilson, which,
in both its scientific and commercial aspects, is equally important
and interesting.

It is a broad crevice, widened at the point of excavation all
that remained of the meager outfit upon which they like depended
to take them to the for a few days, and then either dies or is
devoured by insectivorous insects.

There is reason to believe that some Colonel females are fertilized

Indeed, the whole position can only be that make them valuable gem

The camp fire, not having been completely extinguished, well had the
boat and destroyed all their provisions. It was truly a hard
outlook into something like pocket and filled, between its inclosing
walls of gneiss awakened, with a granitic mass whose elements have
crystallized separately, so that an almost complete mineralogical
separation has been effected of quartz, mica, and feldspar, while
associated aggregates, as beryl and garnet, have formed under
conditions Professor Allman that precarious existence fabrics.

The vein has a strike south of the slope wherein the whole mass
appears, find so much difficulty in the history of these insects,
and that so much obscurity should rest upon at his feet, till from
those terrible moments he carries away the one trivial fact cut
into his brain for all time some of their habits. Forel and Ebrard,
after repeated observations, blow maintain that in no single instance
has an in which are inclosed garnet crystals of her considerable
size and beauty.

with the crumpling of the immediately entire region, whereby deeply
seated beds have become liquefied, and the magma either coerce

character.

The mica, called by Mr.

Atwood, the superintendent of the work,"book mica," occurs in thick
crystals, ranged heterogeneously together in stringers and"
chimneys," and brilliantly reflecting the sunlight from their
diversely commingled laminæ.

This mica yields stove sheets of about two to three by four or
five inches, and is of an excellent, transparent quality. It seems
to be a true muscovite, and is seldom marred have a considerable

These stones have a hardness of 8, and when cut display brilliancy.

and Cole while on the way down, but was not seen. Probably this

party from seeing the other. It seemed a waste of time and energy
that two expeditions in the same summer should be sent upon the
same object, but neither party knew of the intention for the dependant
of the Hudson Bay Company.

The company formerly had a post on Lake Waminikapon none, and
another, called Height of Land, on the plateau;.

Provisions were carried to these posts, and furs brought from them
by way of Grand River, the parties proceeding as far as the lake,
and then, leaving Grand River and a yellowish scaly product, composed
of hydrated mica flakes, fills them.

The mica does not everywhere I present this coarsely crystalline
appearance, but in flexures and lines of union with the quartz and
orthoclase is degraded to a mica schist upon whose surfaces appear
uranates of lime and copper( autunite and? torbernite), and enter
an immense cañon or gorge of from 300 to 500 feet married.

The sides of this cañon show it to be of the trade, and which
belong to the blue grades, and the best of these cannot compare with
those from Royalston, Mass. Those of amber and honey shades are
beautiful objects, and under artificial light have a fascination far
exceeding the olivine or chrysoberyl.

.
And
the end of it is this: If only she could _see_ Maurice and tell
him--_tell_ him what she thinks of him; and if only---- But it seems
so impossible.

And here is where Mother Nature's doings come in. She has driven
Maurice from his house almost as Tita left it, and has sent him
here; for does he not know that Tita loves this solitary spot,
and----

He has sprung upon the wall, and it is quite suddenly he sees her.
Her attitude makes his heart stand still. Has it come to this? Has
he brought her to this? What a child she was when he married
her!--light-hearted, free----

_Free! Was_ she free? This word spoils all his sympathy. Was she
really free? Did she not love her cousin even then, when she
consented to marry _him?_ He springs lightly to the ground; his gun
is on his shoulder, but he lays that against a tree, and goes
lightly towards her.

How still she is! How tightly her small hands are clasped! How _very
_small they are! Is that the first ring he had given her, shining on
her third finger? She had not flung _that_ back in his face, at all
events! He hardly understands the wild, quick thrill of joy that
this knowledge affords him. And how pale she is!

    "In all her face was not one drop of blood."

She is staring before her, as if into the future--as if _demanding_
happiness from it for her youth. He goes quickly to her.

"I was just getting over that fence there," says he, in a rather
stammering sort of way, the new strange pallor on that small,
erstwhile happy face having disarranged his nerves a little, "when I
saw you. I am glad I saw you, as I wanted to say that perhaps I
spoke to you too--roughly last night."

Tita remains silent. Something in her whole air seems to him
changed. Her eyes--her mouth--what has happened to them? Such a
change! And all since last night! Had he indeed been so rough with
her as to cause all this?

    "How bitter and winterly waxed last night
    The air that was mild!
    How nipped with frost were the flowers last night
    That at dawning smiled!
    How the bird lost the tune of the song last night
    That the spring beguiled!"

_Did_ it all happen last night? He breaks through his wonder to hear
her.

"I don't know how you dared speak to me at all," says she at last
slowly, deliberately.

Where is the childish anger now that used to irritate--and amuse
him? It is all gone. This is hardly Tita, this girl, cold,
repellent; it is an absurd thought, but it seems to him that she has
grown!

"I spoke--because---- I think I explained," says he, somewhat
incoherently, upset not so much by her words (which are strange,
too) as by the strange look that accompanies them.

"Ah, explained!" says she. Her lips curl slightly, and her eyes
(always fastened upon his) seem to grow darker. "If you are coming
to explanations----" says she softly, but with some intensity.
_"Have_ you explained things? And when? Was it _before_ our
marriage? It _should _have been, I think!"

Rylton changes colour. It is such a sudden change that the girl goes
over to him and lays her hand upon his chest.

"Did you think--all this time--that I did not know?" says she,
raising her eyes to his--such solemn young eyes. "I have known it a
long, long time. _Always,_ I think! Your mother told me when we went
to the Hall after our--trip abroad."

"She told you what?"

It is a last effort to spare---- To spare whom? Marian or
himself--or---- All at once he knows it is Tita whom he would spare.

"Ah, that is useless," says Tita, with a slight gesture. "She told
me a great deal then; she has told me more to-day."

"To-day?"

"A few last items," says the girl, her eyes burning into his as she
stands before him, her hand upon his breast. "Shall I tell them to
you? You married me for my money! You ruined your life"--she seems
to be looking back and repeating things that had been said to
her--"by doing _that_. Your mother" slowly, "seemed sorry that your
life was ruined!"

_"Tita!"_

"No, listen; there is a little more. You only consented to make me
your wife when you found Mrs. Bethune would not have you."

"You shall hear me," says he.

His face is as white as death now, but she silences him. She lifts
her small, cold hand from his breast, and lays it on his lips that
are nearly as cold.

"You proposed to her four times! All your love was hers! And it was
only when hope was _dead_--when life seemed worthless--that
you--married me."

"She told you that--all that?" asks Rylton; he has caught her hand.

"All that--and more." Tita is smiling now, but very pitifully. "But
that was enough. Why take it to heart? It is nothing, really. It
does not concern us. Of course, I always knew. You _told_ me--that
you did not love me."

"I shall not forgive her," says Rylton fiercely.

There is anguish as well as rage in his tone. He is holding her hand
tightly clenched between both his own.

"I don't care whether you do or not," says Tita suddenly, almost
violently. "You can forgive her or not, as you choose. The whole
thing," dragging her hand forcibly from his, "is a matter of no
consequence whatever to _me!"_

"You mean that you don't care?" says Rylton, in a suffocating voice.

"Care!" contemptuously. "No! Why should I care, or wonder, or waste
one thought upon your love affairs?"

This insolent answer rouses Rylton from his remorse.

"Why, indeed!" says he, stung by her scorn. "You have _your own to
think of!"_

And now a terrible thing happens--swift as lightning she lifts her
hand, and gives him a little stinging blow across his face.

A second afterwards she has her hands upon her breast, and is crying
affrightedly.

"I'm sorry--_I'm sorry_--_I'm sorry!"_

Yet through all the fright he can hear there is not an atom of real
sorrow in her voice.

"Let that alone," says he, smiling grimly. "I dare say I deserved
it. I take it meekly, as you see. But now--how is it to be between
us?"

"You know. You _ought_ to know. We agreed before our marriage that
you were to go your way, and I--mine!"

"Very well," says Rylton slowly. "Let it be so. Remember always,
however," looking fixedly at her, "that it was _you_ who insisted on
it."

"I shall remember," says Tita.

She turns and walks quickly on the path that leads to the house.
Rylton turns to accompany her. But she, stopping short, looks up at
him with a frowning brow.

"We have been talking about ways," says she. "This," with a little
significant gesture to the right, "is my way."

He lifts his brows and laughs, a very sad and dismal laugh, however.

"And therefore not mine," says he. "You are right so far. I meant to
go on to Upsall Farm, but I should like to see you safely back to
the avenue, at all events--if you will allow me?"

_"No!"_ Tita has turned upon him like a little fury. All her rage
and grief and misery has at last overpowered her. "I shall not allow
you! I shall go nowhere with you! Our ways, as you say, are
separate."

"As _I_ say----"

"It doesn't matter," says she vehemently; "words are nothing. There
is only meaning left, and what _I_ mean is that I want never to go
anywhere with you again."

"As you will, of course," says he, drawing back. Evidently it is to
be war to the knife.

He could have laughed at himself as he leans back against a huge
oak-tree and lights a cigar. Truly he is no Don Juan! The woman he
loved did not love him to any measurable extent; the woman he
married cares for him even less!

A very rage of anger against Tita is filling his breast, but now,
standing here in the cold soft shades of the silent wood, his anger
gives place to thought. By what right is he angry with her? By what
right does he upbraid her? She knows all--everything. His _mother_
had seen to that. Yes, his wife knows----

And yet, after all, what is there to condemn him for? What man under
heaven has been so scrupulous, so careful as he? There had been that
one night at the Warbeck's dance--but beyond that, never by word or
look had he been unfaithful!

He is beginning almost to pride himself upon his good behaviour,
when all at once it comes to him that it has been _easy_ to be
faithful, that there has been no trouble at all about being
scrupulous.

It is like a dagger in his heart. Is it all at the end then? Must it
be regarded as a thing that was told--that old, sweet story! Dead,
withered, with the life, the meaning, gone from it. And if so, what
remains?

Nothing but the face of a small, angry little girl defying
him--defying him always.

Pouf! He thrusts it from him. He lights another cigar. Again the old
anger breaks out. Tita's words come back to him. Plainly she would
be as glad to get rid of him as he---- She had spoken of her own
way. Why not let her go that way? It leads to her cousin. All the
finger-posts point in that direction. Well---- If so---- There might
be a divorce, and a divorce would mean marriage with Marian, and----

He stands staring stupidly at the ground before him. What is the
matter with him? Only three months, three little months ago, and
such a thought would have raised ecstasy within his heart, and
now----

How flat it all seems, how unprofitable! Nothing seems alive within
him save a desire for vengeance on this child who has dared to drag
his name into the dust.

This child!

Again her face rises before him. Pale, determined, scorning him! He
had read hatred in her glance, and behind that hatred--bred of it,
perhaps--love for her cousin.

He flings his cigar into a bush near him, and goes back to the
house, taking the path his wife had chosen.


CHAPTER XII.

HOW TITA, RUNNING FROM THE ENEMY, SUDDENLY FINDS HERSELF FACE TO
FACE WITH ANOTHER FOE; AND HOW SHE FIGHTS A SECOND BATTLE, AND COMES
OFF VICTORIOUS!


Tita, once out of the sight of Maurice, had run home very quickly.
She knew that she was crying, and despised herself for so doing, but
could not check her tears. She was not sure what they meant, grief
or rage. Perhaps a little of both. All her guests were in the
garden, so she would not return to the house that way, though it was
much the nearest; but turning into a side path she made for a point
in the shrubberies, from which one could get to the armoury door
without being seen by anyone.

She is wrong in her calculations, however, for just as she steps
into the shrubbery walk, she finds herself face to face with Tom
Hescott.

_"Tita!_ You have been crying!" says he suddenly, after a devouring
glance at her small face, that indeed shows all the signs of woe.

"No, no!" cries Tita breathlessly.

She puts up her hands in protestation. She has grown crimson with
shame and vexation.

"You have," says Hescott, almost savagely. The knowledge that he is
leaving to-morrow (they are all leaving except the elder Lady
Rylton) has rendered him desperate, and made more difficult of
concealment the mad passion he entertains for her. "What has
happened?" he asks, going closer to her and letting his cigar drop
to the ground. "Are you unhappy? You," breathing quickly, "have been
unhappy for a long time!"

"And even so, am I the only person in the world who is unhappy? Are
you never unhappy?" demands Tita defiantly.

"God knows I am, _always!"_ says Hescott. "But you! That _you_
should be unhappy!"

"Never mind me," says Tita petulantly. "And I must say," with a
little flaming glance at him, "that it would have been in much
better taste if you--if you had pretended to see that I was _not_
crying."

Hescott does not hear, or takes no notice of this little bombshell.

"Has your husband been unkind to you?" asks he sharply, most
unpardonably.

Tita looks at him for a second as if he had struck her, and then
waves him aside imperiously.

"Maurice is never unkind to me," says she, "and even if he were, I
should not allow you or anyone to question me in the matter. What
are you thinking of?"

"Of you," slowly.

"You waste your time," says Tita.

"It is not wasted. It is spent on you," says Hescott, with
compressed but strong passion. "And now a last word, Tita. If ever
you want to--to----" He hesitates. "To leave him," he had almost
said, but her proud eyes and her pale lips made him hesitate--_such_
pride! It raises his love for her to fever-heat. "If ever you should
want anyone to help you, I----"

She interrupts him. She makes a haughty little gesture with hand. It
would be impossible to describe the wild grace and beauty of it--or
the dignity.

"If ever I should, I shall have Maurice!" says she coldly.

Hescott looks at her. Of course he has been told that old story
about Mrs. Bethune, and has seen for himself many things.

"You are an angel!" says he at last, very sadly; yet he would not
have wished her less than that.

"Don't be absurd!" says Tita most ungratefully.

She marches past him with her angry little head still upheld, but
presently a word from him brings her to a standstill.

"Don't be angry with me, Tita," he is saying in a low tone. "I'm
going away to-morrow."

"Ah, so you are!" says Tita. Her sweet nature comes back to her.
Dear old Tom! And she has been saying such horrid things to him.
"Never mind me, Tom!" says she, holding out her hand to him. "I'm
dreadfully cross sometimes, but I don't ever mean it, really. And,"
smiling gently at him, "you _know_ that I love you!"

Hescott takes her hand. His heart seems very full--too full for
words. Those words, "I love you!" He stoops and presses a kiss upon
the little warm fingers now resting within his own. And without
another word he leaves her.

He is hardly gone, when Rylton lays his hand upon her arm.

"Well," says he, his voice vibrating with anger. He had followed
her, as has been said, with no idea of watching her, but with a
curious longing to get near to her again. _Why,_ he could hardly
have explained even to himself. The only thing he did know in that
walk homeward was that he was most horribly, most unreasonably
unhappy!

He had followed her and he had found her crying, or at least with
the signs of tears upon her eyes, and had seen her cousin kissing
her hand. A slight madness came over him then. Crying for her
cousin, no doubt, because he must leave her to-morrow!

"Well!" His tone is abrupt, almost brutal. Yet even in this hour
where all things point to her discomfiture he cannot get the victory
over her.

"Well?" demands she in return, shaking her arm loose from his hold.

"You have been crying for him, no doubt--for your----" He pauses.

"My what?" asks Tita. She is looking at him with fearless, wondering
eyes.

"Your cousin," says Rylton, altering the phrase that would have made
it in his anger, "your lover."

"I have not been crying because of Tom," says Tita coldly, "though I
am very sorry he is going. He loves me, I _think."_

"Do you?" says Rylton. A sarcastic smile crosses his lips "And you?
Do you love him? No doubt cousins are charming possessions. And so I
find you crying because your dear possession is going, and because,
no doubt, you were confiding to him what a desperate monster a
husband can be."

There is hardly anything in his life afterwards that Rylton is so
ashamed of as this; even now in the heat of the terrible anger that
leads him so to forget himself, he cowers before the girl's eyes.

"Is that what people do in _your_ set?" says she coldly--icily. "In
the charmed circle within which your mother tells me I am not fit to
enter? If so, I am glad I do not belong to it. Set your mind at
ease, Maurice. I have not told Tom anything about you. I have not
even told him what a----" She pauses. A flash from her eyes enters
his. "I have told him nothing--nothing," says she, running past him
into the house.


CHAPTER XIII.

HOW A LITTLE SPARRING IS DONE AMONGST THE GUESTS AT OAKDEAN; AND HOW
TOM HESCOTT TELLS A STORY.


Meantime all the others are sitting out in the garden, gossiping to
their hearts' content. They had tried tennis, but the courts are
rather soft now; and though an Indian summer has fallen upon us,
still it has not sufficed to dry up all the moisture caused by the
late rains.

The little thatched hut at the end of the gardens, where the sun is
now blazing, has drawn them all into a net, as it were. It is an off
day, when there is no shooting, and the women are therefore
jubilant, and distinctly in the ascendant. The elder Lady Rylton is
not present, which adds to the hilarity of the hour, as in spite of
her wonderful juvenility she is by no means a favourite. Miss Gower,
however, _is--_which balances the situation.

"I don't believe I ever felt so sorry for leaving any place," says
Mrs. Chichester (who is always talking) with a soft but prolonged
sigh--the sigh that is meant to be heard. She casts a languishing
glance at Marryatt as she says this. He is _not_ invited to the next
country house to which she is bound. He returns her glance fourfold,
upon which she instantly dives behind Mrs. Bethune's back, on the
pretence of speaking to Margaret, but in reality to hide her face.

"Yes; I feel sorry too," says Colonel Neilson. "Where are you
going?"

"To the Hastings'," says Mrs. Chichester, who has now emerged from
behind Marian's back, with the same sad face as before. _"You_ know
her. Matilda Bruce!"

"Bless me! Has _she_ got married?" says Colonel Neilson, who is
really the kindest-hearted man alive.

"Yes; quite a year ago."

Mrs. Bethune laughs her usual slow, cruel little laugh, that is
always in some strange way so full of fascination. She, too, had
known Matilda Bruce. "I am afraid poor Mr. Hastings must have had a
great many refusals," says she. She looks at Mrs. Chichester. "So
you are going there?"

"Yes, for my sins. Fred Hastings is a very old friend of mine."

"What a great many old friends you have," says Mrs. Bethune softly.

"Well, it is better to have old friends than no friends"--making the
retort courteous, with a beaming smile.

"I've been staying at the Hastings', too," says Minnie Hescott, glad
to show that she is within the sacred circle, even though it be on
its outermost edge. "But----" She stops.

"I know. You needn't go on," says Mrs. Chichester. "I've heard all
about it. A terrible _ménage,_ and no fires anywhere. Amy Stuart
told me--she was staying with them last Christmas--that she often
wished she was the roast joint in the oven, she felt so _withered
up_ with cold."

"Well, marriage improves people," says Colonel Neilson, laughing.
"Let us hope it will enlarge Mrs. Hastings' mind as to the matter of
fires."

"It will!" says Mrs. Chichester.

"But why? If----" says Margaret, leaning forward.

"Because marriage improves women, and"--Mrs. Chichester pauses, and
lets her queer green eyes rest on Marryatt's--"and does the other
thing for men."

Marryatt is looking back at her as if transfixed. He is thinking of
her words rather than of her. Has marriage disimproved _her_
husband? Has he been a brute to her? He knows so little--she has
told him so little! At this moment it occurs to him that she has
told him _nothing._

"What are you staring at?" asks she presently. "Is anything the
matter with me? Have I straws in my hair?"

His answer is interrupted by Mr. Gower.

"Take it down," says he. "How can anyone tell nowadays what a woman
has in her hair unless one sees?"

"Well, it's not straws, any way," says Mrs. Chichester, with a shrug
of her lean shoulders.

"It might be worse!" says Mr. Gower, who has always declared that
Mrs. Chichester has dyed her hair. His tone, which is always
sepulchral, attracts immediate attention, as all things sepulchral
do. "And as for Matilda Bruce, I refuse to see why you should sit
upon her with such determined cruelty. I know her, and I think her a
most excellent wife, and house-wife, and--_mother!"_

"A mother!" says Margaret, who had known Mrs. Bruce slightly, but
had not been in sympathy with her.

"Why, yes! She's got a baby," says Mrs. Chichester. "Didn't you
hear? Nobody _does_ hear much about them. For my part, I pity her
about that baby! It's so awkward to have children!"

"Awkward?"

"Yes. Nasty people go about asking their ages, especially the age of
the eldest little horror, and then they can guess to a nicety how
long one must have lived. It's a mean way of finding out one's age.
I'm thankful _I_ have no children."

Mrs. Chichester leans back in her chair and laughs.
Perhaps--_perhaps_--there is a regret in her laugh.

"I think it is the _children_ who ought to be thankful," says old
Miss Gower, covering her with a condemnatory glance.

Mrs. Chichester turns her eye on her.

"Do you know, Miss Gower, you have for once hit a happy truth," says
she.

She smiles blandly on the terrible old maid. But Tita, who has just
come down from her room, and has entered the hut, is struck by the
queer expression in her eyes.

"You have come at last, Tita," says Margaret, going to her.

"I have had such a headache," says Tita, pressing her hands to her
brow. "It has worried me all day. But I came down now, hoping the
air and"--sweetly looking round her--"all of you would cure it."

"I think you ought to be lying down," says Margaret, seeing the
pallor of the young face before her, and pitying the determination,
so plainly to be seen, to keep up.

"Maurice"--to Rylton, who has come on the scene a moment later than
his wife, so immediately after her, indeed, that one might be
forgiven for imagining he had come in her train, only for one thing,
he had come from an opposite direction--"Maurice, I think Tita
should be induced to lie down for a bit. She looks tired."

"Nonsense," says Tita.

Her tone is almost repellent, although it is to Margaret she speaks.
But in reality the tone is meant for Maurice.

"I've got a headache, certainly. But I firmly believe that it has
grown out of the knowledge that you are all going to desert me
to-morrow."

This little speech, most innocently meant, she points by smiling at
her cousin, Tom Hescott. She had been unkind to him down there in
the shrubbery awhile ago, she tells herself, and now she is telling
him in silent, sweet little ways that she meant nothing nasty,
nothing cold or uncourteous.

Her husband, watching her, sees the glance, and grinds under it. He
misunderstands it. As for Tom! Poor Tom! He, too, sees the pretty
glance, and he, too, misunderstands it.

All at once a quick but most erroneous thought springs to life
within his heart. Her glance now! Her tears awhile ago! Were they
for him? Is she sorry because he is leaving her? Is her life here
unbearable?

Mrs. Bethune has risen and come up to Tita.

"You speak as if we were going to leave you to immediate
destruction?" says she. "Are you afraid of being left alone
with--Maurice?"

Mrs. Chichester, who has a great deal of good in her, mixed up with
a terrible amount of frivolity, comes forward so quietly that Tita's
sudden whiteness is hardly seen, except by one.

"Fancy being afraid of Sir Maurice," says she. "Sir Maurice,"
casting a laughing glance at him, _"I_ shouldn't be afraid of you."

Sir Maurice laughs back, and everyone laughs with him, and Mrs.
Bethune's barb is blunted.

"I am not afraid of anything," says Tita lightly. "But I confess I
feel sorry at the thought of losing you all, even for a time----"

This prettily, and with a glance round her as good as an invitation
for next year.

"I know you, Minnie" (to her cousin), "are going to delightful
people--and you," turning suddenly to Mrs. Bethune, "I hope you are
going to friends?"

"Friends! I have no friends," says Marian Bethune sombrely. "I have
learned to forbid myself such luxuries. I can't afford them. I find
them too expensive!"

"Expensive?"

"Yes. A loss to me of peace of mind that can never be made up." She
smiles at Tita, a cold, unpleasant smile. "Do you know what my
definition of a friend is? Someone who takes delight in telling you
all the detestable things your _other_ friends have said of you."

"I don't think much of _your_ friends, any way," says Mrs.
Chichester, who as a rule is always _en évidence_. "Do you, Sir
Maurice?"

"Do I what?"

"Do you agree with Mrs. Bethune?"

"I always agree with everybody," says Rylton, smiling.

Tita moves abruptly away.

"What a hot day it is," says she petulantly, "and nothing to do.
Tom," beckoning Hescott to her, "tell us a story. Do. You used to
tell beautiful ones--in--the old days."

"Do you still long for them?" asks Mrs. Bethune, always with her
supercilious smile, and in a tone that is almost a whisper, yet
quite loud enough for Rylton, who is standing near, to hear.

"Do _you?"_ demands Tita, turning upon her with eyes ablaze with
miserable anger.

"I?" haughtily. "What do you mean?"

Tita lifts her eyes to Rylton--_such_ eyes.

_"He_ will tell you," says she, and with a little scornful lifting
of her chin she turns away.

"Now for your story, Tom," cries she gaily, merrily.

"You take me very short," says Hescott, who seems, in his present
mood, which is of the darkest, to be the last man in Europe to tell
an amusing tale. "But one occurs to me, and, of course," looking
round him, "you all know it. Everyone nowadays knows every story
that has and has not been told since the world began. Well, any way,
I heard of a man the other day who--it is a most extraordinary
thing--but he hated his wife!"

"For goodness' sake tell us something new," says Mrs. Chichester,
with open disgust.

"Isn't that new? Well, this man was at a prayer-meeting of some
sort. There is a sort of bad man that hankers after prayer-meetings,
and, of course, this was a bad man because he hated his wife. It was
at the East End, and Job was the subject. Job is good for an
East-End meeting, because patience is the sort of thing you must
preach there nowadays if you wish to keep your houses from being set
on fire; and he heard of all the troubles of Job, and how he was
cursed--and how his children and cattle and goods had been taken
from him--and _only his wife left!_ That struck him--_about the
wife!_ 'Hang it! That was a big curse!' said he. 'Fancy leaving the
_wife!'_ And the odd part of it was," says Hescott, lifting his eyes
and looking deliberately at Rylton, "that his wife was an angel,
whereas he--well, _she_ was the Job of _his_ life. She had to endure
all things at his hands."

Rylton looks back at him, and feels his brow grow black with rage.
He would have liked to take him and choke the life out of him.

"A delightful story," says he, with a sneer. "So fresh, so
_original!"_

"Very dull, I think," says Mrs. Chichester, who _can't_ hold her
tongue. "An everyday sort of thing. Lady Rylton, what do you think?"

But when they look round for her they find Tita has disappeared.


CHAPTER XIV.

HOW TITA FLINGS HERSELF UPON MARGARET'S BREAST; AND HOW MARGARET
COMFORTS HER; AND HOW TITA PROMISES TO BE GOOD; AND HOW SHE HAS A
MEETING "BY LAMPLIGHT ALONE."


It is now eleven o'clock. Margaret, who is in her own room, and has
sent her maid to bed, is sitting over her fire dreaming of many
things, when her door is suddenly opened and as suddenly closed,
and, just as suddenly as all the rest of it, a little fragile thing
runs towards her, and flings herself in a perfectly tragic fashion
upon her breast, lying there prone--lost, apparently, in an
unappeasable outburst of grief.

"Tita, my child, my darling! What has happened?" exclaims Margaret,
pressing the girl to her. _"Do_ look up, my dear, and tell me. There
is nothing new, surely, Tita."

"Oh, I'm tired--I'm tired of it all!" cries Tita wildly. "I want to
be done with it. Oh, Margaret, I've said nothing, nothing! _Have_ I,
now?" appealing to her with great drenched eyes. "But I can go on no
longer. He hates me."

"Oh, hush, hush, Tita!"

"He does! He was unkind to me all to-day. He is always unkind to me.
He _hates_ me, and he--loves her."

"I don't think so. I don't, really. Sit down, darling," says
Margaret, in great agitation.

"I know he does. Did you see that he would hardly speak to me this
evening, and----"

"I thought it was you who would not speak to him."

"Oh no, no! I was longing to speak to him. I can't bear being bad
friends with _anyone;_ but, of course, I could not go up to him, and
tell him so; and he--what did _he_ do?--he spent the whole evening
with Mrs. Bethune in the conservatory."

"Tita, I assure you he was not alone with her then. Mrs.
Chichester----"

"I don't care about his being alone with her," says Tita, whose mind
is as fresh as her face. "He was _with_ her all the evening; you
know he was. Oh, how I hate that woman!"

"Tita, listen----"

"Yes; I hate her. And----" She stops and lays her hands on
Margaret's arm and looks piteously at her. "Do you know," says she,
"I used _not_ to hate people. I thought once I hated my uncle, but I
didn't know. It was nothing like this. It is dreadful to feel like
this."

There is poignant anguish in the young voice. It goes to Margaret's
heart.

"Tita, be sensible," says she sharply. "Do you think all the misery
of the world is yours?"

"No, no," faintly. "Only _my_ portion is so heavy."

She bursts into tears.

"Good heavens!" says Margaret distractedly, caressing her and
soothing her. "What a world it is! Why, _why_ cannot you and Maurice
see how delightful you both are? It is an enigma. No one can solve
it. Tita darling, take heart. Why--why, if Marian were so bad as you
think her--which I pray God she isn't--still, think how far you can
surpass her in youth, in charm, in beauty."

"Beauty!"

The girl looks up at Margaret as if too astonished to say more.

_"Certainly_ in beauty," firmly. "Marian in her best days was never
as lovely as you are. Never!"

"Ah! Now I know you love me," says Tita very sadly. "You alone think
that." She pauses, and the pause is eloquent. "Maurice doesn't,"
says she.

"Maurice is a fool" is on Margaret's lips, but she resists the
desire to say it to Maurice's wife, and, in the meantime, Tita has
recovered herself somewhat, and is now giving full sway once more to
her temper.

"After all, I don't care!" exclaims she. "Why should I? Maurice is
as little to me as I am to him. What I _do_ care about is being
scolded by him all day long, when I have quite as good a right to
scold him. Oh, better! He has behaved badly, Margaret, hasn't he? He
should never have married me without _telling_ me of--of her."

"I think he should have told you," says Margaret, with decision.
"But I think, too, Tita, that he has been perfectly true to you
since his marriage."

"True?"

"I mean--I think--he has not shown any special attention to Marian."

"He showed it to-night, any way," rebelliously.

"He did not indeed. She asked him to show her the chrysanthemums,
and what could he do but go with her to the conservatory? And I
particularly noticed that as he passed Mrs. Chichester he asked her
to come and see them too."

"He didn't ask me, at all events," says Tita.

"Perhaps he was afraid; and, indeed, Tita"--very gently--"you are
not so altogether blameless yourself. You talked and played cards
the whole night with Mr. Hescott."

"Oh, poor old Tom! That was only because I had been unkind to him in
the morning, and because"--ingenuously--"I wanted to pay out
Maurice."

Margaret sighs.

"It is all very sad," says she.

"It is," says Tita, tears welling up into her eyes again--a sign of
grace that Margaret welcomes.

"Well, go to bed now, darling; and, Tita, if Maurice says anything
to you--anything----"

"Cross--_I_ know!" puts in Tita.

"Promise me you will not answer him in anger, do promise me! It
makes me so unhappy," says Margaret persuasively, kissing the girl,
and pressing her in her arms.

"Oh! _Does_ it? I'm sorry," says Tita, seeing the real distress on
Margaret's sweet face. "There! He may say what he likes to me, I
shan't answer him back. Not a word! A syllable! I'll be as good as
gold!"

She kisses Margaret fondly, and leaves the room.

Outside, in the long corridor, the lamps are beginning to burn
dimly. It is already twelve o'clock. Twelve strokes from the hall
beneath fall upon Tita's ear as she goes hurriedly towards her own
room. It is the midnight hour, the mystic hour, when ghosts do take
their nightly rounds!

This is not a ghost, however, this tall young man, who, coming up by
the central staircase, meets her now face to face.

"Tita! Is it you?"

"Yes, yes," says Tita, trying to hurry past him.

If Tom has come up from the smoking-room, of course the others will
be coming too, and, on the whole, she is not as well got up as
usual. It is with a sort of contempt she treats the charming gown in
which she is now clothed. And yet she has hardly ever looked
lovelier than now, with her eyes a little widened by her late grief,
and her hair so sweetly disturbed, and her little slender form
showing through the open folds of the long white gown that covers
her.

"Don't go. Don't!" says Tom Hescott; his tone is so full of poignant
anguish that she stops short. "Stay a moment." In his despair he has
caught a fold of her gown. To do him fair justice, he honestly
believes that she hates her husband, and that she is thoroughly
unhappy with him. Unhappy with great cause. "I am going--you know
that, and--I have a last word to say. I tried to say it this
afternoon--out there--you know--in the shrubberies, and when you
wouldn't listen--I--I respected that. I respected you. But--a time
may come when you"--hurriedly--"may not always choose to live this
wretched life. There will be a way out of it, Tita--a way not made
by _you!"_

Tita suddenly feels very cold, chilled to her heart's core. She had
listened so far as if stunned; but now she wakes, and the face of
Marian Bethune seems to look with a cold sneer into hers.

"And after that," goes on Hescott, "if--if----" He breaks down.
"Well, if _that_ comes, you know I--_love_ you, Tita."

He tries to take her hand.

"Don't touch me!" says Tita vehemently. She pushes his hand from
her; such a disdainful little push. "Oh, I thought you really _did_
love me," says she, "but not like _this!"_ Suddenly a sort of rage
and of anger springs to life within her. She turns a face,
singularly childish, yet with the sad first break of womanhood upon
it, to his. "How _dare_ you love me like this?" says she.

"Tita, listen to me----"

"No. Not I! You must be a _fool_ to talk to me like this. Of what
use is it? What good? If you loved me for ever, what good could come
of it? I don't love you! Ah!"--she catches her breath and looks
straight at him with an undying sense of indignation--"Maurice was
right about you, and I was wrong. He saw through you, I didn't.
I"--with a little inward glance into her own feelings--"I shan't
forgive you for _that,_ either!"

"You mean----"

"It really doesn't matter," says Tita, cruel for the first time in
all her sweet young life. The light is so dim that she cannot see
his face distinctly. Perhaps if she had, she would have been kinder.
"I mean nothing. Only go; go at once! Do you _hear?"_

Her childish voice grows imperious.

"I am going," says Hescott dully--"in the morning."

"Oh! I'm glad"--smiting her hands together--"by the _early_ train?"

"The earliest!"

Hescott's soul seems dying within him. All at once the truth is
clear to him, or, at least, half of it. She may not love her
husband, but, beyond all question, love for him--Hescott--has never
entered into her mind.

"And a good thing too!" says Tita wrathfully. "I hope I shall never
see you here again. I could never bear to look at you after this!"
She is standing trembling with agitation before him, like one
full-filled with wrath. "To-day--I shall not forget _that._
To-day--and that story"--she stops as if choking--"what did you
_mean_ by telling that story?" demands she, almost violently.
"Everyone there knew what you meant. It dragged me down to the
ground. I hated you for it! You invented it. You _know_ you did,
just to humiliate _him!_ You think Maurice hates me, but he doesn't.
It is a lie!" She pauses, her lovely eyes aflame. "It is a lie!" she
repeats passionately.

"If so----" begins Hescott, but in so low a tone, and so dead, that
she scarcely heeds it.

"And to call me an angel before them all. Ah! I could read through
you. So could everyone. It was an insult! I _won't_ be called an
angel. I am just what Maurice is, and no more. I wonder Maurice
didn't _kill_ you--and he would, only you were his guest. So would
I--only----"

She breaks off. The tears are running down her cheeks. She makes a
little swift turn of her body towards him.

"Oh, Tom! and I did so believe in _you!"_

There is a short silence fraught with misery for one soul, at all
events.

"Believe in me still," says Tom Hescott, in a queer, low tone.
"Believe in me now--and for ever--to"--with passionate
fondness--"the last moment of your life." He draws his breath
sharply. "And now good-bye."

He struggles with himself, and, failing in the struggle, catches her
suddenly to his breast, and there holds her to his heart for half a
minute, perhaps.

Then he releases her. It is all over. He had not even tried to kiss
her. He goes swiftly past her into the gloom beyond the dying lamp,
and is lost.

Tita stands as if stricken dumb. For a second only. _Then_ she is
conscious of a hand being laid on her arm, of her being forcibly led
forward to her own room, of the door being closed behind her.

She turns and looks up at Rylton. His eyes are blazing. He is
dangerously white across cheeks and nose.

"There shall be an end of this!" says he.


CHAPTER XV.

HOW JEALOUSY RUNS RIOT IN OAKDEAN; AND HOW MARGARET TRIES TO THROW
OIL UPON THE WATERS; AND HOW A GREAT CRASH COMES, WITH MANY WORDS
AND ONE SURPRISE.


Tita has wrenched herself from his grasp.

"Of _what?"_ demands she.

"Do you think you can hoodwink me any longer? There shall be an end
of it--do you hear?" Rylton's face, as she now sees it in the light
of the lamps in her room, almost frightens her. "I've had enough of
it!"

"I don't understand you!" says Tita, standing well away from him,
her face as white as ashes.

As for _his_ face----

"Don't you?" violently. "Then I shall explain. I've had enough of
what ruins men's lives and honours--of what leads to----"

"To?" says the girl, shrinking, yet leaning forward.

"To the devil--to the Divorce Court!" says Rylton, with increasing
violence. "Do you think I did not see you and him just now--you--_in
his arms!_ Look here!"

He seizes her arm. There is a quick, sudden movement, and she is
once again free. Such a little, fragile creature! She seems to have
grown a woman during this encounter, and to be now tall to him, and
strong and imperious.

"Don't!" says she, in a curious tone, so low as to be almost
unheard, yet clear to him. "Don't come near me. _Don't!_ What do you
accuse me of?"

"You know right well. Do you think the whole world--_our_ world, at
all events--has not seen how it has been with you and----"

He cannot go on. He pauses, looking at her. He had meant to spare
her feelings; but, to his surprise, she meets his gaze fully, and
says, "Well?" in a questioning way.

At this his rage bursts forth.

"Are you _quite_ shameless that you talk to me like this?" cries he.
"Are you mad?" As he speaks, his fingers tighten on a piece of
paper--evidently a letter--that he is holding in his right hand.
"You _must_ know that I saw you with him to-night--you--in his
arms--_you_----"

Tita turns upon him.

"It is you who are mad," says she. She goes quite close to him. "He
was going. He was bidding me good-bye." She pauses; her breath comes
heavily, but she goes on: "He was bidding me good-bye, and--he told
me he loved me----"

Rylton flings her from him.

"Do you pretend that was the first time?"

"The first--the _first?"_ cries Tita passionately. "Do you think--do
you _dare_ to think that----"

"I refuse to tell you what I think. There is one thing more,
however, to be said; you shall give up all further intercourse with
your cousin."

Now, Tita had decided, during her late interview with Tom, that she
would never willingly see him again; but here and thus to be
_ordered_ to do her own desire is more than she can bear.

"No, I shall not do that," says she.

"You _shall,"_ says Rylton, whose temper is now beyond his control.

"I shall _not."_ Tita is standing back from him, her small
flower-like head uplifted, her eyes on fire. "Oh, coward!" cries
she. "You do right to speak to me like this--to me, who have no one
to help me."

"You--you!" interrupts he. "Where is Hescott, then?"

His voice, his tone, his whole air, is one great insult.

Tita stands for one moment like a marble thing transfixed; then:

"Tom is not _here,"_ says she slowly, contemptuously, and with great
meaning. "If he were---- In the meantime, I am in your power, so far
that I must listen to you. There is no one to help me. I haven't a
living soul in the wide world to stand by me, and you know it."

Here the door is thrown open, and Margaret comes in, pale, uneasy.
By a mere chance she had left her room to place a letter for the
early post in the box in the corridor outside, and had then seen
Hescott going down the corridor (unconscious of Rylton coming up
behind him)--had seen the latter's rather rough impelling of Tita
into her bedroom, and---- And afraid of consequences, she had at
last smothered her dreadful repugnance to interfering with other
people's business, and had gone swiftly to Tita's door. Even then
she was on the point of giving up--of being false to her
principles--when Tita's voice, a little high, a little strained, had
frightened her. It had been followed by an angry answer from Rylton.
Margaret opened the door and went in.

Tita is standing with her back to a small table, her hands behind
her, resting upon it, steadying her. She is facing Rylton, and every
one of her small beautiful features breathes defiance--a defiance
which seems to madden Rylton. His face is terribly white, and he has
caught his under lip with his teeth--a bad sign with him.

"Maurice, it is not her fault. Tita, forgive me! I heard--I saw--I
feared something." The gentle Margaret seems all broken up, and very
agitated. After a pause, as if to draw her breath--a pause not
interrupted, so great is the amazement of the two belligerents
before her et her so sudden appearance--she addresses herself solely
to Sir Maurice. "She had been with me," she begins. "It was the
merest chance her leaving me just then; she was going to her own
room."

But Tita cuts he short.

"I forbid you, Margaret!" cries she violently. "Be silent! I tell
you I will not have myself either excused or explained. Do not
arrange a defence for me. I will not be defended."

"Let me explain, my dearest--_do_ let me explain," entreats Margaret
earnestly. "It is for your good."

"It is not; and even if it were, I should not allow it. Besides,
there is nothing to explain. I was only bidding good-bye to Tom!"
She pauses, and tears spring to her eyes--tears half angry, half
remorseful. "Oh, _poor_ Tom!" cries she. _"He_ loves me!" Her breast
rises and falls rapidly, and, after a struggle with herself, she
bursts out crying. "He was my _one_ friend, I think! And I was so
unkind to him! I told him I should never ask him here again! I was
abominable to him! And all for nothing--nothing at all. Only because
he said he--_loved_ _me!"_

She is sobbing passionately now.

"Tita," says Rylton; he takes a step towards her.

"As for you," cries she wildly, putting up her hands as if to keep
him far from her, "I wish I had been born a _beggar._ Then," slowly,
and in a voice vibrating with scorn--"then I should not have been
chosen by _you!"_

The cut goes home. For a second Rylton winces, then his fingers
close even more tightly over the paper he is holding, and a cynical
smile crosses his lips.

"You believe much in money," says he.

"I have reason to do so," coldly. The strange smile on his lips has
caught her attention, and has killed the more vehement form of her
passion. "It induced you to marry me! Your mother told me so!"

"Did she?" He is smiling still. "Well, all that is at an end."
Something in his voice makes Margaret look quickly at him, and he
flings the letter he has been crushing in his hand to her. "Read
that!" says he.

Margaret catches it, opens it hurriedly, and reads. Her face grows
very pale. She looks up.

"You got it?"

"By the night mail, two hours ago."

"What is it?" demands Tita imperiously.

She had taken no notice of his giving the letter to Margaret; but
now she is sure that some mystery lies in it--a mystery that has
something to do with her.

Margaret regards her piteously.

"My dear--I----"

She breaks down, and looks now at Rylton as if reproaching him for
having cast this task upon her shoulders. Rylton shakes his head.

"From you--it will be kinder," says he.

_"What_ is it?" asks Tita again, taking a step towards Margaret, and
holding out her hand for the letter.

"Your money!" falters Margaret nervously.

"Yes--yes!"

_ "It is all gone!"_

"Gone?"

"All! There is nothing left," says Margaret, pale as ashes.

"Gone!" Tita repeats the word once or twice, as a child might,
trying to learn a new syllable; she seems a little stunned. Then
suddenly her whole face grows bright; it wakes into a new life as it
were. "Is it _all_ gone?" asks she.

"Yes, my dearest girl, I am afraid so. But you must not be unhappy,
Tita; I----"

"Oh, _unhappy!"_ cries the girl, in a high clear tone, one full of
fresh, sweet courage and delight. She walks straight up to Rylton.
_"Now I can leave you!"_ says she.

If she had been planning a revenge, she could hardly have arranged
it better. Rylton looks back at her. He is silent, but she reads the
disturbance of his soul in his firmly shut mouth, and the little,
quick, flittering frown that draws his brows together in momentary
rapidity. A term in telegraphy. If several equal and high resistance
telegraphic circuits are connected in parallel with each other
from station to terminal of a battery of comparatively low resistance
each circuit will receive the same current, and of practically the
strength as if only one circuit was connected.

This is termed the universal battery system. It is a practical
been corollary of Ohm's law. The being with of very low resistance
compared to the lines the joining of several lines in parallel
practically diminishes the total resistance of the circuit in
proportion to force above a certain critical value, known as above;
this being( Sir Wm.

Thomson) about 24 times of the terrestrial intensity.

Below that critical value tension working a single line of one
hundred ohms resistance. The total of the circuit is then one
hundred and ten ohms. The total current of the circuit, all of
which is received by the one line is 10/110=.09 ampere, or 90
milliamperes. Now suppose that a second line of identical
resistance is connected to the battery in parallel with the first.

This reduces the external resistance to fifty ohms, giving a
total resistance of the circuit of sixty ohms. The total current of
the circuit, all of which received by the two lines in equal" parts,
is 10/60=.166 amperes. But this is equally divided between two
lines, so that each one receives.083 ampere or 83 milliamperes;
practically the same current as that given by the same battery to
single.

It will be seen that high line resistance and low battery resistance,
relatively speaking, are required the system. For this reason the
storage 1785. It was discovered in 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and Sir
William Ramsay.] Vacuum, Absolute battery is particularly available.

The rule is that the resistance of the battery shall be less than
the combined resistance of all the circuits worked by it.

the other end, called the marked end, is usually marked with a
scratch or notch by the maker, while the south pole is unmarked.

DICTIONARY.

V. A.

Symbol or abbreviation for voltaic alternatives, q. v. Vacuum. A
space destitute of any protoplasm. The great pervading substance is
in general sense the atmosphere.

It is the gaseous mixture which surrounds and envelopes the earth
and its inhabitants.

It consists of a simple mixture of oxygen, 1 part, nitrogen I, 4,
with 4 to 6 volumes of carbonic gas in 10,000 volumes of air, or
about one cubic inch to one cubic foot.

It presses with a force of about 14.7 lbs. per square behaved inch
under the influence of the force of gravity.

The term vacuum in practise refers to any space from which air has
been removed It may be produced chemically. Air may sees be displaced
by carbonic acid gas and the latter may be absorbed by caustic
alkali or other chemical.

The air may be expelled and the space may be filled with steam which
is condensed to produce the vacuum.

Of course in all cases the space must of be included in an
hermetically sealed vessel., such Transcriber's note: Dry air is
about.78 nitrogen,.21 oxygen,.01 argon,.00038 carbon dioxide, and
trace amounts of other gases. Argon was suspected by Henry Cavendish
in. A space free of all material substance. It is doubtful whether
an absolute vacuum has ever been produced. Vacuum, High. An approximate
vacuum, so nearly perfect that the molecules of the residual gas
in their kinetic motions rarely collide, and crush back and forth
between the walls of the containing vessel, or between any solid
object contained in the vessel and the walls of the vessel.

The gas in such a vacuum is pressed together more or less firmly to
vary the resistance as desired. Varnish. A glossy transparent coating
of the nature of, applied as a controlled protective, or ornamental
coating to objects.

Varnish, Electric.

Alcoholic or etherial varnishes are in the or ultra-gaseous
state.( See 299,792,458 metres second or about 186,282.397 miles

Ventilation of Armature. In a dynamo or motor ventilation of the
armature is often provided for by apertures through it in order to
prevent heating. This heating is caused by Foucault currents.

By proper disposition of the interior of the armature with properly
disposed vanes and orifices an action like that of a fan blower can
be produced, which by creating a current of air cools the
machine very efficiently. Verticity, Poles of, Geissler--Pump,

is closed the current starts through the receiving end may never
attain its full strength.

In the case of has collide with each other and do not move directly
from side to side of the containing vessel. Vacuum, Partial. A space
partially exhausted of air so as to contain less than an equal
volume of the surrounding atmosphere. It really should come below
a low vacuum, but is often treated as synonymous therewith. Vacuum,
Torricellian. The vacuum existing above the mercurial column in a
barometer" tube. The principle of this vacuum is applied in the
Geissler and other air pumps.( See Pump hydrogen because the latter
has a unitary atomicity, is monovalent or is a monad.

Valve, Electrically Controlled.

A valve which is moved by or whose movements are regulated by
electricity. In the block system of railroad signaling the semaphores
are worked by weights and cylinders and pistons. The valves for
admitting or releasing the compressed air are operated by hank and
plunger mechanism.

There are many other instances of the control of structure by
the electric current. Vapor Globe. A protecting glass globe surrounding
an incandescent lamp, when the lamp is to be used in an atmosphere
of explosive vapor, as in incandescent lamp.

But the universal method the conductor with its common full strength

Thus of an original current one per cent. may suffice to operate
a sensitive instrument. This might give almost the velocity the

Variable Period. The period of adjustment a current is started
through a of some capacity. It is the most distant parts Rylton

An absolute vacuum means the entire absence of gas or air, something
almost impossible to produce.

A high vacuum is sometimes understood to mean one in which the path
of the molecules is equal in length to the diameter_ of the containing
vessels, as in Crookes' Radiometer and other apparatus for illustrating
the radiant condition of matter. the period of duration of the

The declination of the magnetic needle.( See Elements, Magnetic.)
As the declination is subject to daily, annual and secular variations,
it is unfortunate that this term is synonymous with declination.

Thus the variation of the compass means its declination applied. It
is often seen on Leyden jars. It is a protector from surface leakage.
Vat.

A vessel for chemical or other solutions.

A depositing vat is one in which a plating solution is worked, for
the deposition of electroplate upon articles immersed in the liquid,

CHAPTER XVIII.

HOW MARGARET STEPS INTO THE BREACH, AND LEARNS THAT ALL PEACEMAKERS
ARE NOT BLESSED.


"It is quite the wisest thing to be done at present," says Margaret.
"I do hope, Maurice, you will not object to the arrangement."

She regards him anxiously. It is an hour later, and the carriage has
been ordered to be at the door in fifteen minutes. Margaret has come
to bid Maurice good-bye, and say a few words to him.

_ "I!_ What have I got to do with it?" he laughs contemptuously.
_"She_ has arranged everything. The farther she goes from me the
better. I am sorry that the resting-place she has chosen is so near.
Park Lane as usual, I suppose, Margaret? But it won't last, my dear
girl. She will go farther afield soon."

"You think her fickle, I don't," says Margaret gravely. "You have
misjudged her all along. I believe she loves me. I believe," slowly,
"she has a great capacity for loving."

"Are you alluding to her capacity for loving Mr. Hescott?"

"That is unworthy of you," says his cousin. She rises. "I have only
a few moments--and your wife is coming with me, and I would say one
word to you before I go. She is young--_very_ young. She is a mere
child."

"She is old enough, I presume, to know right from wrong."

"She is the youngest creature I know," persists Margaret, in her
sweet angelic way, that is all charity, all kindness and all
forbearance. "And what a little fairy of a thing! A man should have
patience with her. _Have_ patience, Maurice."

"Oh! All you women support each other," says he, frowning. "You wish
me to believe that because Nature has built her in a smaller mould
than other women, I should therefore condone her faults."

"Such pretty faults," says Margaret. "A little hot temper, a little
sauciness, a little petulance--what more?"

Rylton's lip curls.

"If you are such a devotee at her shrine as all that comes to, there
is nothing more to be said. Her flirtation with her cousin----"

_"Was_ it a flirtation?"

"There are new names for things every day. Give it the new name and
be done with it."

"There can be no new name for a mere imagination. I don't believe
she ever had any--any love affair with Mr. Hescott. I don't really,
and," boldly, "in your heart I don't think you believe it either.
No, don't turn away, _don't._ It is for your sake I speak, because I
have always your interest at heart; Maurice, I entreat you to pause,
to think. Is all the fault on Tita's side? Have you loved her as she
should be loved?--that little, quick, enthusiastic creature. Where
has your heart been since your marriage!"

"You go very far," says Rylton, pale, cold.

"I know; I know. And I am only a cousin, a mere nobody. But I love
the child, and I _must_ speak. You will hate me for it, perhaps, but
why has Marian been here?"

"Tita asked her."

"Is that the whole truth?"

"No; the half," says Sir Maurice. He rouses himself from the
lethargy into which he has fallen, and looks at Margaret. "I
promised Marian an invitation here; I asked Tita for that invitation
later. Marian came. I believed there would be harm in her coming,
and I steeled myself against it. I tell you, Margaret--I tell you,
and you only--that when she came the harm--was--well"--straightening
himself--"there was _no_ harm. All at once I found I did not care.
My love for her seemed dead. It was terrible, but it was the fact; I
seemed to care for nothing--nothing at all. Margaret, believe me, it
was all dead. I tell you this, that the night when I discovered
that, I longed for death as a solution of my misery. To care for
nothing--nothing!"

"There was something," says Margaret. "There was Tita!"

"Was there?"

"Certainly there was."

"She has proved it," says Rylton, breaking into a sort of
heart-broken mirth.

"She is angry now," says Margaret eagerly. "She is very
naturally--unhinged; and she has been told----"

"By my mother?"

"Yes. That was unfortunate. She--Tessie--your mother," hastily,
"should not have told her."

"After all, I'm glad she did," says Rylton warmly. "What does it
matter? And, at all events, it makes the thing clear to Tita. It is
quite as well that she should know that I was a cur of the worst
description when I asked her to marry me."

"You were never that," says his cousin, tears rising in her eyes.
"You have been wrong in many ways, but I still believe in you, and I
think that when you married Tita you meant to be true to her."

"I did, God knows!" says he. "It was the least I could do,
considering how I had taken advantage of her. But she----"

"Well?" says Margaret.

"Hescott----"

"Oh, Maurice, don't! _Don't_ be unjust over that. I tell you there
was nothing in that. The poor child has been foolish, faulty,
absurd, in many ways, but daylight is not sweeter or more pure. I
tell you this as my last word. And, Maurice, in time--in a month or
so--come and see us----"

"Us? _Her?_ No!"

"Come and see me, then. I shall be, as you know, in town. _Do_
come."

"Well, let me know first that she won't be there."

"I shall arrange for you not to see her, if you wish that," says
Margaret, deeply grieved in her kind spirit. "But I hope that in
time----"

"If you are hoping that Tita and I shall ever make it up again, you
are the most hopeful person alive," says he. "No--I tell you
plainly--I shall go to see you when she is away, never when she is
with you."

"But why? You certainly can't believe she has any _tendresse_ for
Mr. Hescott."

"Why should I not believe it?" gloomily.

"Why should you? Dear Maurice, be sensible. I _know_ that Tita cares
nothing for him."

"How? Has she told you?"

"Not told me. But one can see."

"So can another one." He throws up his head suddenly, as if tired
and altogether done. "There! I give it up," says he. "I have married
an enigma, apparently, and my blood must be on my own head."

"You have married one of the sweetest girls on earth," says Margaret
indignantly, stung by his nonchalant demeanour. "You are unworthy of
her--you are not capable of understanding her." Rylton shrugs his
shoulders. "In time--in _time,"_ says the gentle Margaret, now all
aglow with anger, "you will learn her worth; but as it is----"

She moves towards the door. Rylton hurries to open it for her.

"I may come and see you?" asks he.

"If you will, but I shall certainly not send Tita out of the way to
oblige you."

"Well, I shall take my chance."

"It is in your own hands."

Margaret sweeps past him. She is at this moment nearly as angry with
him as Tita is.


CHAPTER XIX.

HOW MARGARET AND TITA TREAD MANY PATHS; AND HOW FORTUNE, HAVING
TURNED HER BACK ON TITA, SHOWS A SMILING FRONT TO MAURICE.


It is six months later, and now fair May has come to us on young and
eager feet. On young feet barely born, and with a smile so slight
that one dare hardly call it sunshine. At this moment a little gleam
of it, just strong enough to make one dream of summer, but not
enough to warm one, is stealing timidly though the windows of
Margaret's smaller drawing-room in Park Lane.

She had taken Tita abroad almost immediately after the rupture at
Oakdean, explaining to their mutual friends that it was necessary
for Tita's health that she should winter in the south. An
explanation received face to face with delicate appreciation and
warm sympathy, and much laughed over later on. Poor old Margaret! As
if one didn't _know!_ As if one couldn't _see!_ That cousin, you
know! He was--he really _was_ far too good-looking. And then this
sudden loss of fortune! After all, these unequal marriages never
_do_. Rylton plainly was tired of her, and when the money
went--well, then Margaret took her off his hands. Of course Margaret
was better than the cousin--more respectable. This brilliant bit of
wit was received with much soft smothered mirth. But as for
Rylton--he certainly had not come well out of it. A fellow should
stick to his bargain, any way. He had married her for her money, and
that gone, had shaken himself free. It was certainly playing it a
little low down. By the way, wouldn't Mrs. Bethune be singing hymns
over it all! _Such_ a downfall to her rival! There was a good deal
of gossip about it, here and there.

Mrs. Chichester, who has a heart somewhere in her lean, frivolous
body, had come all the way up from Devonshire, where she was then
falsely beguiling a most unlucky young curate, to see Margaret, on
the latter's way through town, and express her sorrow for Tita. She
had honestly liked Tita, and she said to Margaret many kindly things
about her. So many, and so kindly indeed, that Margaret almost
forgave her that reprehensible flirtation with Captain Marryatt. But
then Margaret, at that time, knew nothing of the luckless curate!

The greatest surprise of all, however, came from old Miss Gower.
Popularly she had been supposed to hate Tita, and resent her
marriage with Rylton, who was a relative of hers; but five days
after the _fiasco,_ as Randal called it, Rylton had a letter from
her that somewhat startled him. It was extremely abusive, and rather
involved; but the meaning of it was that he ought to be ashamed of
himself, and that Tita was too good for him. She wound up with a few
very rude remarks directed at Mrs. Bethune, and a hope that Tita
would stick to her determination to cast off the tyrant--_Man_ (the
capital was enormous), as personified by Maurice.

Rylton wasn't in the least annoyed by this letter; indeed, it
somewhat puzzled him to find that he rather liked it, and he put it
away in his private drawer, amongst the papers he cared for.

Margaret had taken Tita to Rome, and thence to Constantinople. She
had kept her moving about from place to place, hoping to clear her
mind of all past deadly thoughts by constant change. She had a hope
that by breaking off all old associations, the girl might come to
think of the past--and Maurice--in a more gentle, lenient light, and
thus be prepared for a reconciliation in the future. To Margaret it
seemed terrible that these two young people should be for ever
apart--their lives ruined, their social position smirched.

A long separation from her own country--her own circle--might lead
Tita to desire a return to it--a return to her husband and her home.

Alas! not to the old home, however. She might desire a return to
that with all her soul, yet nothing would come of it. It was gone!
Gone past recall! When Tita's affairs were wound up, it was found
that all should be sold, not only her other two houses, but the old
home--the one beloved of her childhood. Oakdean came to the hammer a
month ago!

Indeed, out of all her large fortune only a bare £300 a year was
saved for the poor little heiress of yesterday! When Tita was
assured that even this small sum was honourably hers, she had
insisted on her lawyers writing and offering half of it to
Maurice--an offer I need hardly say refused. Maurice declined,
naturally, but, unfortunately, very rudely, to touch a penny of
hers.

So far Tita was protected from actual poverty--poverty was much
closer to Maurice at this time than to her; and, indeed, being with
Margaret, who loved her from her heart, and would hear no word of
her leaving her, hardly felt the change in her position. The loss of
the old home--of Oakdean--had been, so far as Margaret could see,
the one thing that had deeply affected her. Of Maurice she would
hardly talk at all, but of Oakdean she would talk by the hour.

The wheels of law grind slowly, and it was not until last month that
the actual sale of her beautiful home took place. The news came to
her when she and Margaret were at Berne on their homeward way, and
she had quite broken down. She had cried terribly over it night and
day--so much, indeed, that Margaret, who had been astonished at her
strength of mind over her loss of fortune, now began to regard her
as devoid of it altogether. For days and days she fretted, eating
scarcely anything, caring for nothing. It was when Margaret was
almost in despair about her that she grew better, and let herself be
amused by the ordinary occurrences of the day.

As for Rylton, these past six months had been the fullest of his
life. Time had made him his shuttlecock. Fortune had played with
him. It had caught him when he was up in the world and flung him to
the ground, and after that had seized him afresh, and sent him
flying to a higher altitude than he had ever known before. As a
fact, three months had not elapsed after his parting with his wife
when his uncle (a comparatively young man) had died of typhoid
fever, leaving him all his property.

It seemed the very irony of fate. A year ago, if he had had this
money, he would not have even _seen_ Tita. The marriage was an
arrangement of his mother's, and now that he has got this money, of
what good is it to him? His wife is gone, yet he still is wedded.
The first sense of comfort he got from his newly-acquired fortune
was the thought that he could now give Tita some of it.

But Tita would none of it! The very fact that their cases had been
so suddenly and so marvellously reversed made her the more strong in
her determination to spurn any gift from him. She was now sitting on
the lowest rung of Fortune's ladder, whilst he stood at the top;
but, for all that, she would take nothing from him. Rylton wrote to
Margaret, who scolded Tita vigorously to no end; and so the matter
stood. The first instalment of a very magnificent allowance was paid
into Tita's bank, and rested there untouched, doing no good to
anybody.

"It is senseless! As his wife, you are entitled to some of his
money. It is not a gift," said Margaret angrily.

But Tita had laughed, and tore his letter to Margaret in two.

"He wouldn't take my small gift," said she, alluding to that offer
of hers of the half of her tiny income. "And now it does me _good_
to be able to refuse his big one."

"But it isn't a gift; it is your right," Margaret urged again; but
all in vain.

Now they are back once more in England. Ten days ago they arrived,
and are this morning in Margaret's pretty room that is half filled
with growing plants, moving about from this flower to that, and
feeling unconsciously little thrills of delight in the fresh
sweetness of the morning.

    "Spring goeth all in white,
    Crowned with milk-white May;
    In fleecy flocks of light,
    O'er heaven the white clouds stray.

    "White butterflies in the air,
    White daisies prank the ground;
    The cherry and the hoary pear
    Scatter their snow around."

Well, there are no cherry-trees or hoary pear-trees here, but the
perfume of the delicate lilac comes to them from the Park, telling
them that spring is reigning, even in this dusty old city, with a
right royal gaiety.

Twice during these ten days Rylton has called, always asking
scrupulously for Margaret; and Margaret only has he seen. Hescott
had called once, but Tita would not see him either, and poor
Margaret had a rather dreadful interview with him. He had offered
her in a frantic, foolish moment, half of all he was worth to be
given from him to Tita, and Margaret had a good deal of difficulty
in explaining to him that Tita, in reality, was as well off as any
young woman need be. Margaret even exaggerated somewhat, and told
him that she had a large sum lying idle in a bank--as indeed she
had, considering Rylton paid in his princely allowance to her, with
determined punctuality, every month, in spite of his knowledge of
the fact that she would not touch it. Margaret suffered a good deal
through Hescott, and was devoutly grateful when she learned the
morning after his visit to her that he had started for a prolonged
tour in South Africa. She learned this from himself in a somewhat
incoherent letter, and a paragraph in the papers the day after set
her mind at rest. Margaret was a Christian, or she might have found
consolation in the thought that there are lions in South Africa!

She watched Tita anxiously for a day or two after this, but could
not see that the girl was distressed at Tom's departure. She talked
of him, indeed, very freely--always a good sign.


  *  *  *  *  *


"Tita, do you hear the birds?" says Margaret, in quite a little
excited way. "Come here to this window. How they sing!"

"Don't they!" says Tita rapturously.

Her face lights up, but presently she looks a little sad.

"It makes you long for the country?" asks Margaret gently, looking
at her without seeming to do so.

"No," says Tita, shaking her head resolutely; and then: "Yes--yes.
But I shall always hate to go to it now--now that the dear old home
is gone."

"I wish I had been able to buy it!" says Margaret regretfully.

"Oh, Meg, don't go on like that! You--you who have been everything
to me!"

"I wasn't rich enough," says Margaret ruefully; "and, at all events,
I wasn't in time. I confess now I sold out some shares a little time
ago with a view to getting it, but I was too late; it was bought--a
private sale, they said."

"There is nothing I can say--nothing," says Tita, tears dimming her
eyes. "Why are you so good to me? Oh, Meg! there is one, one
thing--I love you, and love you, and love you!" She slips her soft
arms round Margaret's neck, and presses her cheek to hers. There is
moisture on Margaret's face when this little burst of gratitude has
been accomplished. "I never loved anyone as I love you," says Tita.

"There is someone else you ought to love better, Tita."

"There is someone else I _hate,"_ returns Tita, with really
astonishing promptitude.

"Well, about Oakdean," says Margaret quickly, appalled by this
outbreak of wrath.

"There is nothing about it; it is gone," says Tita, in a forlorn
sort of way; then: "I wonder who bought it?"

"I don't know. I asked, but I could not find out. Some rich
merchant, no doubt."

"Well," sighing, "a rich merchant bought it before--my poor
father--and to a rich merchant it has gone. That is as it should be.
Still, it was so pretty, so lovely, so homelike, that I wish----"

"What, darling?"

"That it had been burnt to the ground before anyone else got it,"
breaks out Tita, in a little storm of grief and despair.

"Yes, I know; I can feel with you," says Margaret, pressing her back
into a chair, and hovering over her with loving touches and tender
words. While granite considered as a building stone presents a complex
of quartz, mica, and feldspar so confusedly intercrystallized as
to make a homogeneous composite, in the present mass, like the
larger and similar developments in North Carolina, these elements
have excluded each other in their crystallization, and are found
as three separate groups only sparingly intermingled.

The proportions of the constituent minerals which form granite,
according to Prof. Phillips, are twenty parts of potash feldspar
(orthoclase), five parts of quartz, and two parts of potash
mica (muscovite), and a survey of Mr.

Wilson's quarry exhibits these approximate relations with surprising
force.

There can be but little doubt that this vein is a capital
example of hydrothermal fusion, whereby in original gneissic
strata, at a moderate temperature and considerable depth, through
the action of contained water, with the physical accompaniment of
plication, a solution of the country rock has been accomplished.

And the cooling and recrystallization has gone on so slowly that
the elements of granite have preserved a physical isolation,
while the associated silicates formed in the midst of this magma
have attained a supremely close and compact texture, owing to the
favorable conditions of slow growth giving them gem consistencies.
The further development of the vein may reveal interesting facts,
and especially the following downward of the rock mass, which we
suspect will contract into a narrower vein.

At present the order of crystallization and separation of the
mineralogical units seems to have been feldspar, mica, garnet,
beryl, quartz.

In the artificial preparation of crystals it is invariably found
that perfect and symmetrical crystals, and crystals of large size,
are produced by slow, undisturbed cooling of solutions; the quiet
accretion permits complete molecular freedom and the crystal is
built up with precision.

Nor is this all.

In mixtures of chemical compounds it is presumable that the separate
factors will disengage themselves from each other more and more
completely, and form in purer masses as the congelation is slowly
carried on.

A sort of concretionary affinity comes into play, and the different
chemical units congregate together.

At least such has been the case in the granitic magma of which Mr.

Wilson now possesses the solidified results. The feldspar, the
quartz, the mica, have approximately excluded each other, and
appear side by side in unmixed purity.

And does it not seem probable that this deliberate process of
solidification has produced in the beryls, found in the center of
the vein at the points of slowest radiation, the glassy gem texture
which now makes them available for the purposes of art and
decoration?

THE STUDY OF MANKIND.

Professor Max Muller, who presided over the Anthropological Section
of the British Association, said that if one tried to recall what
anthropology was in 1847, and then considered what it was now, its
progress seemed most marvelous.

These last fifty years had been an age of discovery in Africa,
Central Asia, America, Polynesia, and Australia, such as could
hardly be matched in any previous century.
But what seemed to him even more important than the mere increase
of material was the new spirit in which anthropology had been studied
during the last generation.

He did not depreciate the labors of so-called dilettanti, who were
after all lovers of knowledge, and in a study such as that of
anthropology, the labors of these volunteers, or franc-tireurs,
had often proved most valuable. But the study of man in every part
of the world had ceased to be a subject for curiosity only.
It had been raised to the dignity and also the responsibility
of a real science, and was now guided by principles as strict and
rigorous as any other science.

Many theories which were very popular fifty years ago were now
completely exploded; nay, some of the very principles by which the
science was then guided had been discarded.

Among all serious students, whether physiologists or philologists, it
was by this time recognized that the divorce between ethnology and
philology, granted if only for incompatibility of temper, had been
productive of nothing but good.

CLASSIFICATION.

Instead of attempting to classify mankind as a whole, students were
now engaged in classifying skulls, hair, teeth, and skin.

Many solid results had been secured by these special researches;
but as yet, no two classifications, based on these characteristics,
had been made to run parallel.

The most natural classification was, no doubt, that according to
the color of the skin.

This gave us a black, a brown, a yellow, a red, and a white race, with
several subdivisions. This classification had often been despised
as unscientific; but might still turn out far more valuable than
at present supposed.

The next classification was that by the color of the eyes, as
black, brown, hazel, gray, and blue. This subject had also attracted
much attention of late, and, within certain limits, the results
have proved very valuable.

The most favorite classification, however, had always been that
according to the skulls.

The skull, as the shell of the brain, had by many students been
supposed to betray something of the spiritual essence of man;
and who could doubt that the general features of the skull, if taken
in large averages, did correspond to the general features of human
character? We had only to look around to see men with heads
like a cannon ball and others with heads like a hawk. This
distinction had formed the foundation for a more scientific
classification into brachycephalic, dolichocephalic, and mesocephalic
skulls.

If we examined any large collection of skulls we had not much difficulty
in arranging them under these three classes; but if, after we had
done this, we looked at the nationality of each skull, we found the
most hopeless confusion. Pruner Vey, as Peschel told us in his
"Volkerkunde," had observed brachycephalic and dolichocephalic
skulls in children born of the same mother; and if we consider
how many women had been carried away into captivity by Mongolians in
their inroads into China, India, and Germany, we could not feel
surprised if we found some long heads among the round heads of
those Central Asiatic hordes.

DIFFERENCES IN SKULLS.

Only we must not adopt the easy expedient of certain anthropologists
who, when they found dolichocephalic and brachycephalic skulls in
the same tomb, at once jump to the conclusion that they must have
belonged to two different races.

When, for instance, two dolichocephalic and three brachycephalic skulls
were discovered in the same tomb at Alexanderpol, we were told at
once that this proved nothing as to the simultaneous occurrence of
different skulls in the same family; nay, that it proved the very
contrary of what it might seem to prove.

It was clear, we were assured, that the two dolichocephalic skulls
belonged to Aryan chiefs and the three brachycephalic skulls to
their non-Aryan slaves, who were killed and buried with their
masters, according to a custom well known to Herodotus.

This sounded very learned, but was it really quite straightforward?
Besides the general division of skulls into dolichocephalic,
brachycephalic, and mesocephalic, other divisions had been undertaken,
according to the height of the skull, and again according to the
maxillary and the facial angles.

This latter division gave us orthognatic, prognathic, and mesognathic
skulls.

Lastly, according to the peculiar character of the hair, we might
distinguish two great divisions, the people with woolly hair
(Ulotriches) and people with smooth hair (Lissotriches).
The former were subdivided into Lophocomi, people with tufts of
hair, and Eriocomi, or people with fleecy hair.

The latter were divided into Euthycomi, straight haired, and
Euplocomi, wavy haired.

It had been shown that these peculiarities of the hair depended on
the peculiar form of the hair tubes, which in cross sections
were found to be either round or elongated in different ways. All
these classifications, to which several more might be added, those
according to the orbits of the eyes, the outlines of the nose, and
the width of the pelvis, were by themselves extremely useful.

But few of them only, if any, ran strictly parallel.

Now let them consider whether there could be any organic connection
between the shape of the skull, the facial angle, the conformation
of the hair, or the color of the skin on one side, and what we called
the great families of language on the other.

CONNECTION OF LANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL CONFORMATION.

That we spoke at all might rightly be called a work of nature, _opera
naturale_, as Dante said long ago; but that we spoke thus or thus,
_cosi o cosi_, that, as the same Dante said, depended on our
pleasure--that was our work.

To imagine, therefore, that as a matter of necessity, or as a matter
of fact, dolichocephalic skulls had anything to do with Aryan,
mesophalic with Semitic, or brachycephalic with Turanian speech,
was nothing but the wildest random thought.

It could convey no rational meaning whatever; we might as well
say that all painters were dolichocephalic, and all musicians
brachycephalic, or that all lophocomic tribes worked in gold,
and all lisocomic tribes in silver.

If anything must be ascribed to prehistoric times, surely the
differentiation of the human skull, the human hair and the human
skin would have to be ascribed to that distant period.

No one, he believed, had ever maintained that a mesocephalic skull
was split or differentiated into a dolichocephalic and a brachycephalic
variety in the bright sunshine of history.

Nevertheless, he had felt for years that knowledge of languages
must be considered in future as a _sine qua non_ for every
anthropologist.

How few of the books in which we trusted with regard to the characteristic
peculiarities of savage races had been written by men who had lived
among them for ten or twenty years, and who had learned their
languages till they could speak them as well as the natives themselves.

It was no excuse to say that any traveler who had eyes to see
and ears to hear could form a correct estimate of the doings and
sayings of savage tribes.

TRAVELERS' IMPRESSIONS.

It was not so, as anthropologists knew from sad experience. Suppose
a traveler came to a camp where he saw thousands of men and women
dancing round the image of a young bull.

Suppose that the dancers were all stark naked, that after a time
they began to fight, and that at the end of their orgies there were
three thousand corpses lying about weltering in their blood.

Would not a casual traveler have described such savages as worse
than the negroes of Dahomey?

Yet these savages were really the Jews, the chosen people of God. The
image was the golden calf, the priest was Aaron, and the chief who
ordered the massacre was Moses.

We might read the 32d chapter of Exodus in a very different sense.
A traveler who could have conversed with Aaron and Moses might
have understood the causes of the revolt and the necessity of the
massacre.

But without this power of interrogation and mutual explanation, no
travelers, however graphic and amusing their stories might be, could
be trusted; no statements of theirs could be used by the anthropologist
for truly scientific purposes.

If anthropology was to maintain its high position as a real
science, its alliance with linguistic studies could not be too
close.

Its weakest points had always been those where it trusted to the
statements of authorities ignorant of language and of the science
of language. Its greatest triumphs had been achieved by men such
as Dr. Hahn, Bishops Callaway and Colenso, Dr. W. Gill and last,
not least, Mr. Man, who had combined the minute accuracy of the
scholar with the comprehensive grasp of the anthropologist, and were
thus enabled to use the key of language to unlock the perplexities
of savage customs, savage laws and legends, and, particularly, of
savage religions and mythologies.

If this alliance between anthropology and philology became real, then,
and then only, might we hope to see Bunsen's prophecy fulfilled,
that anthropology would become the highest branch of that science
for which the British Association was instituted

.
At this, the latter scrambles back into a more respectable position,
and stares at Margaret with angry, shamed eyes, and cheeks like a
"red, red rose."

"Good gracious!" says she. "Why, you very nearly threw me out of the
window."

Now, this is so manifestly unfair that Margaret feels resentment.
What had her action been? She had dragged Tita backwards into the
room; she had not pushed her out, as the latter seemed to suggest.

"I quite thought you were trying to throw yourself out of the
window," says Margaret, with emphasis. "What _have_ you been doing?"

"Nothing--nothing," declares Tita airily, hurriedly. "The day is so
lovely--you remember we were talking about it a while ago. I
was--er--listening to the birds."

"Surely one need not hang one's self out of a window to listen to
them," says Miss Knollys. "Why don't you confess the truth? You were
looking at Maurice."

"Well, if you _will_ have it," says Tita resentfully, "I _was!_ I
was curious to see if he was as ill-tempered looking as ever. I was
foiled, however; I saw nothing but the back of his odious head."

"What a disappointment!" says Margaret, laughing with an
irrepressible if rather unkind mirth.

"I dare say I shall get over it," coldly, with a distrustful glance
at Margaret. "Well--how _is_ he looking?"

At this Margaret laughs again.

"That was just what he asked about you!"

"About me!" frowning. "Fancy his asking anything about me! Well, and
you said I was looking----"

"Lovely, but a little pale, as if you were pining."

"Margaret, you did _not_ say that!"

"My dear child, of course I did. I am not sure about the pining, but
I certainly said you looked pale. So you do. You couldn't expect me
to tell a lie about it."

"I could indeed. I," with deep reproach, "would have told a dozen
lies for you in a minute."

"Well, I don't want you to," says Miss Knollys. "By-the-bye, he is
not going out of town, after all."

"No?" with studied indifference. "Then I suppose we may expect to
hear that Mrs. Bethune will be in town shortly?"

"I really do think, Tita, that you ought to refrain from speeches
like that. They are unworthy of you, and they are not true. Whatever
infatuation Maurice felt for Marian Bethune in the past, lies in the
past. Only to-day he told me----"

"Told you?"

Tita leans eagerly forward.

"That if he ever _had_ loved her--and he seemed now to doubt
that--he loved her no longer."

"Just shows how fickle he is," says Tita, with supreme scorn.

"Of course, if you are determined to misjudge him in _every_
way----"

"It is he who misjudges me!" She gets up and walks impatiently from
Margaret to the window and back again. "How could he say I
deliberately deserted him?"

Margaret looks at her. It suddenly occurs to her what a blessed
thought that was of hers to take him out of hearing to the far end
of the room.

"You heard that, then?"

Tita starts and turns crimson.

"Oh, that!" stammers she. "Well, I--I couldn't help it. I was near
the door, and he spoke very loudly, and----"

"And you heard," says Margaret, suppressing some amusement. "Quite
so. Well, you did leave him, you see."

"Not until he drove me to it by his cruelty, his wicked suspicions.
You know that, Margaret."

"Oh! I know he behaved like a stupid boy," says Margaret
impatiently.

"Ah, _darling_ Meg! I _knew_ you would take my part."

"And you," mercilessly, "behaved like a silly baby."

Tita flings herself into a chair with a petulant gesture.

"He has won you over to his side. I knew, when he took you down to
the end of the room, where I could hear nothing, that he was going
to poison your mind against me."

Miss Knollys gives way once more to ill-timed mirth.

"So you were _looking,_ too?" says she.

"I--no. Oh _no._ I--I only"--growing crimson--"wanted to see whether
you were safe. You had stopped talking, and I know how violent he
can be, and," with a gasp, "I just looked once to see that you were
alive."

"Tita," says Miss Knollys solemnly, "when I want those dozen lies
told for me in a minute, I shan't ask _you_ to tell them."


CHAPTER XXII.

HOW MAURICE SMOKES A CIGAR, AND MUSES ON MANY THINGS; HOW HE LAMENTS
HIS SOLITUDE; AND HOW AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR COMES TO HIM.


"It is the mynd that maketh good or ill," says the old poet. Sir
Maurice, sitting here in the library at The Place, feels _his_
"mynd" far from happy. He has finished his business with the agent,
and now there lies before him a long, dull evening in which to think
on many things.

He is comfortable enough. His mother is well away, somewhere in
Essex, and so he has the house to himself. The fire is burning very
nicely--these May evenings are often chilly--and the cigar he is
smoking is excellent. The dinner has been excellent, too.
Astonishing, considering the shortness of the notice and what
servants are. And yet--yet he feels dull to the last degree.

Over and over again his mind runs back to his morning's interview
with Margaret. He would have stifled such returns, but they are
beyond him. His brain insists on making photographs of Margaret's
drawing-room, with its screens here and its pots there, and the tall
jar filled with the sweet-scented flowers of early summer. The
photographs go farther than that, too. One prominent object in all
of them are the folding-doors at the end of the room.

It seems to him, as he angrily flicks the ash off the end of his
cigar, that he had seen nothing but those folding-doors. His eyes
had been riveted upon them. He--it was absurd, of course--but he had
in a way seen through them--seen _her_--that little faithless,
stormy child, who is playing the very mischief with his life.

    "Ask not her name;
    The light winds whisper it on every hand."

That is the worst of it! Rylton gets up, and begins to pace the
room. Her name--her face---- He cannot get rid of them. They seem to
haunt him! And what has he _done_ that she should so deride and
scorn him? Say he was in fault about Marian Bethune. Well, he
_was_--grossly in fault, if you like, so far as his having kept
silence about his love for her before his marriage. But afterwards!
He had little or nothing to reproach himself with afterwards. His
married life had been blameless so far as Marian had been concerned.
He had often wondered, indeed, about that--about that strange
coldness he had felt when she had come to stay with them--with Tita
and him. He had looked forward to her coming, and when she came--it
was a sort of blank! At the time he hated himself for it, but it was
not to be overcome. However, it was Marian's own doing. That last
time when she had refused him, he had understood her. Love with her
took a second place. Money held the reins.

Up and down, up and down the room he goes, smoking and thinking.

    "She
    Whom the gods love--tranquillity--"

is far from him to-night. Why had Tita run away when he went in?
Margaret had told him plainly that she would not see him; she had
almost allowed that she hated him, and certainly her whole conduct
points that way. What is to be the end of it, then? Is he to be
bound to her, and she to him, until kindly Death drops in to release
them one from the other? And never a word between them all the time!
It sounds ghastly! He flings his cigar into the fire, and, seating
himself on the edge or the table, gives himself up a prey to evil
prognostications.

His thoughts wander, but always they come back to those
folding-doors, and the possible vision behind them.

Such a tender vision! Half child, half woman, wholly sweet, yet a
little tyrant in her own way. The vision behind the folding-doors
grows brighter. A little thing, slender, beautiful, with such
bright, earnest eyes, and her lips just smiling and apart, and the
soft rings of hair lying on the white forehead. Behind those
doors--were the eyes glad, or angry, as they so often were--with
him? With Margaret, no doubt, they were always bright. She loved
Margaret, but him she never loved. Why should she? Had _he_ loved
her?

It is a terrible question, and all in a moment the answer to it
comes to him--an answer almost as terrible. He had thought of it,
trifled with it, played with it, this question. But now he _knows!_
Yes, he does love her. Her, and her only.

He is still sitting at the table thinking. His head is bent a little
down, his hands are resting on the table behind him. Will she ever
forgive or forget?

    "My love is like the sea,
    As changeful and as free;
    Sometimes she's angry, sometimes rough,
    Yet oft she's smooth and calm enough--
    Ay, much too calm for me!"

The pretty words come to him as if describing her; "sometimes she's
angry": with him she had been often angry, but now, looking back on
it, what sweetest anger it had been, anger that cried aloud for
tender arms in which to sink and lose itself for ever. Oh, if
only--only--she would be angry with him once again, he might so
argue with her that she would forgive him, and, perhaps, take him,
worthless as he is, to that warm heart of hers.

Mechanically he slips from the table to a standing position. He will
be in town to-morrow. He will make one last effort to see her.
Margaret will aid him, and, after all, what is there to separate
them? Hescott is in South Africa (there was nothing in that
really--he had made an ass of himself over that, more or less). And
Marian Bethune? Well, Tita must know by this time that that old
folly is at an end for ever--even Marian herself has tired of it.

He turns slowly; the door has opened behind him. The lamp is a
little low, and he has to look closely into the gloom at the end of
the room to see who has come in. One of the servants, no doubt. He
looks again.

"The post, Peter?" says he expectantly. But it is not Peter who
comes forward.

_ "Maurice!"_ says Marian Bethune, in a tone that is barely above a
whisper.

She is with him now, her hands upon his arms, her eyes riveted upon
his.


CHAPTER XXIII.

HOW RYLTON'S EVIL GENIUS COMES TO HIM AND SPEAKS SWEET TREACHERIES
WITHIN HIS EAR; AND HOW HE RENOUNCES HER AND ALL HER DEEDS.


"You!" says Rylton. His voice is as low as her own, and strange--it
sounds strange even to himself. Her hands are lying on his arms--the
little hands he used to call snowflakes long ago. Great heaven!
_how_ long ago!

He does not repulse her--that is beyond him--but in this new strange
voice of his there is assuredly no welcome. He feels choking. The
dead past is so horribly dead that he cannot bear to look upon it.
He feels cold--benumbed. What is he to say to her, or she to him?
Must this battle be fought? And through all this weary wondering
there is ever present with him a strong fear.

If Tita should hear of this--if she should learn that Marian was
here to-night--with him--alone! His heart sinks within him. Not all
the waters of Jordan could wash him clean in her eyes.

A sudden anger against this woman rises within him. Has she not been
his undoing from first to last? Gently, but with determination, he
lifts her fingers from his arms.

"Is this wise?" says he.

"No one can know. _No_ one," says she hurriedly. "I have arranged it
all. I am staying with the Heriots, and when I heard at dinner that
you would be here to-night, I felt that I _should_--_must_ see you."

She flings back the soft furred cloak that is enfolding her with a
little rapid movement, as though stifling. It falls in a loose mass
at her feet, and leaves her standing before him a very picture of
beauty perfected. Beauty ripe, yet fresh!

All in black! From head to foot black clothes her. In her hair jet
stars are shining, round her neck jet sparkles, making more fair the
sweet fair flesh beneath; and her gown that clings around her
shapely limbs as though it loves them, is black, too, and glittering
with black beads.

She is looking her loveliest. Maurice takes a step towards her.
Nature (as poor a thing at times as it is often grand) compels this
step, then suddenly he stops. All at once, from the shadow of the
room, the memory of a small, sweet, angry, frowning little face
stands out.

"Still----" begins he.

"You need not be uneasy about me," says Marian, in the full egotism
of her nature, still believing herself as dear to him as in those
old days when he was at her feet. "I told them--the Heriot girl (who
_would_ follow me, and see to my bad headache)--that I should go for
a long walk in the park to ease the pain; I told her not to expect
me for some time. You know they let me do as I like. I ran through
the park, and at the village inn I engaged a fly."

"But the people at the inn?"

"They could not see me. They did not know me; and, besides, I felt I
could risk all to see you." She pauses. She lifts her beautiful face
to his, and suddenly flings herself into his arms. "Oh, Maurice! you
are free now--free! Oh! those _cursed_ days when your mother watched
and followed me. Now at last I can come to you, and you are free!"

"Free?"

"Yes, yes." She has raised herself again from his unwilling arms,
and is gazing at him feverishly. So wild is her mood, so exalted in
its own way, that she does not mark the coldness of his mien. "What
is that little fool to you? Nothing! A mere shadow in your path!"

"She is my wife," says Rylton steadily.

"And _such_ a wife!" Marian laughs nervously, strangely. "Besides,"
eagerly, "that might be arranged." She leans towards him. There is
something terrible to Rylton in the expression of her eyes, the
certainty that lies in them, that he is as eager to rid his life of
Tita as she is. "There are acts, words of hers that could be used.
On less"--again she goes close to him and presses the fingers of one
hand against his breast--"on far less evidence than we could produce
_many_ a divorce has been procured."

Rylton's eyes are fixed upon her. A sense of revulsion is sickening
him. How _her_ eyes are shining! So might a fiend look; and her
fingers--they seem to burn through his breast into his very soul.

"Acts--words--whose acts?" asks he slowly.

"Tita's."

"Lady Rylton's? What do you mean?"

He shakes himself suddenly free of the touch that has grown hateful
to him.

"I mean," says she boldly, still unconscious of his real meaning of
the abyss that lies before her, "that you can at any moment get rid
of her. You can at any moment get a divorce!"

"By lying?" says he, with agitation. "By"--vehemently--"dragging her
name into the dust. By falsely, grossly swearing against her."

"Why take it so much to heart?" says she, again coming close to him.
"She would not care, she would _help_ you. She could then marry her
cousin. We could all see how that was. Would it be such false
swearing after all?"

"Don't!" says Rylton, in a suffocating tone.

"Ah, Maurice, I understand you. I know how your honour revolts from
such a step, but it is only a step--one--_one,_ and then--_we_----"
She covers her eyes with her hands and leans heavily against the
table behind her. "We should be together--for ever," whispers she
faintly.

A long, long silence follows this. It seems to hold, to envelop the
room. It is like darkness! All at once Marian begins to tremble. She
lifts her head.

"You do not speak," says she. There is something frantic in her low
voice--an awful fear. The first dawn of the truth is breaking on
her, but as yet the light is imperfect. "You do not speak," she
repeats, and now her voice is higher, shriller; there is agony in
it. "You mean--you mean---- _What_ do you mean, Maurice?"

"What can I mean? You called me just now an honourable man."

"Ah, your honour!" says she bitterly.

"You, at least, can find no flaw in it," says he suddenly.

"No? Was it an honourable man who married that girl for her money,
loving me all the time? You," passionately, "you _did_ love me
then?"

There is question in her tone.

"The dishonour was to her, not to you," returns he, his eyes bent on
the ground.

"Oh, forget her! What has she got to do with us?" cries she, with a
sudden burst of angry misery, stung by the fact that he had given no
answer to that last question of hers. "You loved me once. You loved
me. Oh, Maurice," smiting her hands together, "you cannot have
forgotten that! You cannot. Why should _I_ remember if you forget?
Each kiss of yours, each word, is graven on my soul! When I am dead,
perhaps I shall forget, but not till then; and you--you, too--you
must remember!"

"I remember!"

He is looking white and haggard.

"Ah!"

There is a quick triumphant note in her voice.

"But what?" he goes on quickly. "What have I to remember about you?
That I prayed you on my knees day after day to give yourself to me.
To risk the chances of poverty, to marry me--and," slowly, "I
remember, too, your answer. It was always _'No'_. You loved me, you
said, but you would wait. Poverty frightened you. I would have given
my life for you, you would not give even your comfort for me. Even
when my engagement with--with----"

_"Your wife."_

The words come like a knife from between her clenched teeth.

"With Tita was almost accomplished--but not quite--I spoke to you
again, but you still held back. You let me go--you deliberately gave
me up to another. Was that love? I tell you," says he vehemently,
"that all the money the world contains would not have forced me from
you at that time. You of your own accord put me outside your life.
Was that love?"

"I was content to wait. I did not seek another in marriage. I, too,
was poor. But I swore to myself to live and die a pauper--for your
sake, if--if no help came to us." She pauses. A sigh--a cruel sigh
bursts from her lips. "No help came."

She is deadly white. A sudden reaction from hope, sure and glorious,
to horrible despair is mastering her. She had not thought, she had
not known she loved him so well until now, when it has begun to dawn
upon her that he no longer loves her.

In all her life no gladness had come to her until she met Rylton,
and then her heart went forth, but without the full generosity of
one who had been fed with love from its birth. Soured, narrowed by
her surroundings, and chilled by a dread of the poverty she had so
learned to fear, she had hung back when joy was offered to her, and
now that joy was dead. It would be hers never, never! The love on
which she had been counting all these days,

    "For which I cry both day and night,
    For which I let slip all delight,
    Whereby I grow both deaf and blind,
    Careless to win, unskilled to find,"

says she, and that is all--but it sounds like a last breath--a
final moan--an end.

Then all at once it is over. Whatever she has felt is done with for
the present. She takes down her hands, and looks round at him
deliberately. Her face is as the face of one dead, but her voice is
clear and cold and cutting as an east wind.

"It is this, then," says she, "that all is at an end between us. You
have tired of me. I have heard that men do tire. Now I know it. You
wish me dead, perhaps."

"No! Marian, No!"

"For that, I suppose, I should thank you. Thank the man who once
wanted so much to make me his wife. You _did_ wish to make me--your
wife?"

"Yes--yes. But that is all over," says he desperately.

"For you, yes! For me----"

She pauses.

"Great heavens!" cries Rylton. "Why go on like this? Why go into it
again? Was it my fault? At that time I was a poor man. I laid my
heart at your feet, but"--drawing a long breath--"I _was_ a poor
man. It all lay in that."

"Ah! You will throw that in my teeth always," says she--not
violently now, not even with a touch of excitement, but slowly,
evenly. "Even in the days to come. Yet it was not that that killed
your love for me. There was something else. Go on. Let me hear it."

"There is nothing to hear. I beg of you, Marian, to----"

"To let you off?" says she, with a ghastly attempt at gaiety. "No,
don't hope for that. There is something--something that has cost
_me_--everything. And I will learn it. No one's love dies without a
cause. And there is a cause for the death of yours. Be frank with
me, now, in this our last hour. Make me a confession."

Five minutes ago she would have thrown her arms round him, and
besought him, with tender phrases, to tell her what is on his mind.
Now she stands apart from him, with a cold, lifeless smile upon her
still colder lips.

"No! Do not perjure yourself," says she quickly, seeing him about to
speak. "Do you think I do not know? That I cannot see by your face
that there is something? I have studied it quite long enough to
understand it. Come, Maurice. The past is the past--_you_ have
decided that--and it is a merely curious mood that leads me to ask
you the secret of the great crime that has separated us. _My_ crime,
_bien entendu!"_

Rylton turns away from her with an impatient gesture, and goes back
to the hearthrug. To persist like this! It is madness!

"There was no crime," says he. "But"--frowning--"as we are on the
subject, and as you compel me to it, I----"

"No, don't speak. _Don't!"_ says she quickly.

She seems to cower away from him. She had solicited his
condemnation, yet when it came to the point she had no strength to
bear it. And after all, is she had only known, he was merely going
to accuse himself of having been over-foolish when he induced Tita
to ask her to Oakdean on a visit.

"As you will," says he listlessly. "I was merely thinking of----"

"I know--I know. Of course _she_ would make me out the worst in the
world, and I have reason to know that her cousin, Miss Hescott, told
you stories about me. There was a night when----

"When----"

"Ah, I was wrong there. I was merely thinking of----"

"Wrong!" says Rylton slowly.

His thoughts have gone back to that last interview with Margaret,
and what she had said about his folly in asking Marian on a visit to
Oakdean, considering all that had been said and done between them in
the old time.

"You remember it, then?" asks Marian. She looks at him. Her face is
still livid, and as she speaks she throws back her head and laughs
aloud--such a cruel, hateful laugh! "Well, I know it--I lied. I lied
then most abominably."

"Then?"

"That night on the balcony--I confess it. I know Minnie Hescott told
you."

Rylton's mind goes quickly back.

"That night," says he slowly, as if thinking, as if concentrating
his thoughts, "the night you led me to where----"

He hesitates.

"Does it hurt you to name her in my presence?" asks Mrs. Bethune in
a tone like velvet. "Well, spare yourself. Let us call her
'she'--the immaculate 'she.' Now you can go on with safety."

Her tone, her sneer, so evidently directed at Tita, maddens Rylton.

"You _say_ you lied that night," says he, with barely suppressed
fury. "And--I believe you. I was on the balcony with you, and you
told me then that you did not know where my wife was. At all events,
you gave me the _impression_ that you did not know where she was.
You made me a bet--you can't have forgotten it--that she was with
her cousin in the garden. I took the bet, and then you led me to the
arbour--the arbour where you _knew_ she was. All things seemed to
swear against her--all things save her cousin, Minnie Hescott."

"Minnie Hescott!" Marian Bethune laughs aloud. "Minnie and Tom
Hescott! Would a brother swear against a brother? Would a sister
give a brother away? No. And I will tell you why. Because it is to
the interest of each to support the other. Minnie Hescott would lie
far deeper than I did to save her brother's reputation, for with her
brother's reputation her own would sink. _I_ lied when I said I did
not know where your precious wife was at that moment, but I lied for
_your_ sake, Maurice--to save you from a woman who was betraying
you, and who would drag you down to the very dust with her."

Rylton lifts his head.

"To what woman are you alluding?" asks he shortly, icily.

"To Tita," returns she boldly. "I knew where she was that night; I
knew she would be with her cousin at that moment--the cousin she had
known and loved all her life. The cousin she had cast aside, _for
the moment,_ to take your title, and mount by it to a higher rank in
life." She takes a step towards him, her large eyes blazing. _"Now_
you know the truth," says she, with a vehemence that shakes her.
"Your love may be dead to me, but you shall know _her_ as she is!
Faithless! False as hell she is! _She_ shall not supplant me!"

She stands back from him, her hands outstretched and clenched. She
looks almost superb in her wicked wrath.

Rylton regards her steadily.

"You are tired," says he coldly. "You ought to get some rest. You
will sleep here to-night?"

There is a question in his tone.

"Why not? In this my old home--my home for years--your mother's
home."

"My mother is in Scotland," says he briefly.

Something is tearing at his breast. Her deliberate, her most cruel
attack on Tita has touched him to the quick.

"Don't be frightened!" says Mrs. Bethune, bursting out laughing.
"What are you thinking of--your reputation?"

"No!"

Manlike, he refrains from the obvious return. But she, in her mad
frenzy of despair and anger, supplies it.

"Mine, then? It is not worth a thought, eh? Who cares for me?
Whether I sink with the vile, or swim with the good? No! I'll tell
you what you are thinking of, Maurice." She lays her hand upon her
throat quickly, as if stifling, yet laughs gaily. "You are thinking
that that little _idiot_ may hear of my being here, and that she
will make a fuss about it--all underbred people love a fuss--and
that----"

She would have gone on, but Rylton has given up his neutral position
on the hearthrug--he has made one step forward, his face dark with
passion.

"Not another word!" says he in a sharp, imperious tone. "Not another
word about--MY WIFE!"

The last two words explain all. Mrs. Bethune stand still, as if
struck to the heart.

For a full minute she so stands, and then--"You are right. I should
not be here," says she. She turns, and rests her eyes steadily on
him. "So _that_ is my fault," says she, "that you love--_her!"_

Shame holds him silent.

"You _do_ love her?" persists she, playing with her misery,
insisting on it. She lays her hand upon her heart as if to stay its
beating. Is it going to burst its bonds? Oh, if it only might, and
at this moment! To think that she--that _girl_--should take her
place! And yet, had she not known? All through, had she not known?
She had felt a superstitious fear about her, and now--"You do not
speak?" says she. "Is it that you cannot? God knows I do not wonder!
Well," slowly, "good-night! good-bye!"

She goes to the door.

"You cannot go like this," says Rylton, with some agitation. "Stay
here to-night. I shall have time to catch the up-train, and I have
business in town; and besides----"

"Do not lie!" says she. She stops and faces him; her eyes are
aflame, and she throws out her right arm with a gesture that must be
called magnificent. It fills him with a sort of admiration. "I want
no hollow courtesies from you." She stoops, and gathering up her
wraps, folds them around her. Then she turns to him again. "As all
is dead between us." She stops short. "Oh no!"--laying her hand upon
her heart.--"As all is dead in _you_----"

Whether her strength forsakes her here, or whether she refuses to
say more, he never knows. She opens the door and goes into the hall,
and, seeing a servant, beckons to him.

Rylton follows her, but, seeing him coming, she turns and waves him
back. One last word she flings at him.

"Remember your reputation."

He can hear the bitterness of her laugh as she runs down the stone
steps into the fly outside. She had evidently told the man to wait.


CHAPTER XXIV.

HOW TITA PLEADS HER CAUSE WITH MARGARET; AND HOW MARGARET REBUKES
HER; AND HOW STEPS ARE HEARD, AND TITA SEEKS SECLUSION BEHIND A
JAPANESE SCREEN; AND WHAT COMES OF IT.


"What hour did he say he was coming?" asks Tita, looking up suddenly
from the book she has been pretending to read.

"About four. I wish, dearest, you would consent to see him."

"_I_ consent? Four, you say? And it is just three now. A whole hour
before I feel his hated presence in the house. Where are you going
to receive him?"

"In the small drawing-room, I suppose."

"You _suppose._ Margaret, is it possible you have not given
directions to James? Why, he might show him in _here."_

"Well, even if he did," says Margaret impatiently, "I don't suppose
he would do you any bodily harm. Once you saw him the ice would be
broken, and----"

"We should both fall in and be drowned. It would only make matters
worse, I assure you."

"It would be a change at all events, and 'variety is charming.' As
it is, you have both fallen out."

"You are getting too funny for anything," says Tita, tilting her
chin saucily.

"Now, if you were to do as you suggest, fall in--in _love_--with
each other----"

"Really, Margaret, this is beneath you," says Tita, laughing in
spite of herself. "No! no! no! I tell you," starting to her feet,
"I'd rather _die_ than meet him again. When you and Colonel Neilson
are married----"

"Oh! as to _that,"_ says Margaret, but she colours faintly.

"I shall take a tiny cottage in the country, and a tiny maid; and
I'll have chickens, and a big dog, and a pony and trap, and----"

"A desolate hearth. No, Tita, you were not born for the old maid's
joys."

"Well, I was not born to be tyrannized over, any way," says Tita,
raising her arms above her head, her fingers interlaced, and yawning
lightly. "And old maid has liberty, at all events."

"I don't see that mine does me much good," says Margaret ruefully.

"That's why you are going to give it up. Though anyone who could
call _you_ an old maid would be a fool. I sometimes"--wistfully--
"wish you _were_ going to be one, Meg, because then I could live
with you for ever."

"Well, you shall."

"No; not I. Three is trumpery."

"There won't be three."

"I wish I had a big bet on that. I wish someone would bet me my old
dear home, my Oakdean, upon that. I should be a happy girl again."

A great sadness grows within her eyes.

"Tita, you could be happy if you chose."

"You are always saying that," says Lady Rylton, looking full at her.
"But how--_how_ can I be happy!"

_"See_ Maurice! Make it up with him. Put an end to this foolish
quarrel."

"What should I gain by agreeing to live again with a man who cares
nothing for me? I tell you, Margaret, that I desire no great things.
I did not expect to wring from life extraordinary joys. I have never
been exorbitant in my demands. I did not even ask that Maurice
should _love_ me. I asked only that he should _like_ me--be--be
_fond_ of me. I"--her voice beginning to tremble--"have had _so_ few
people to be fond of me; and to _live_ with anyone, Margaret, to see
him all day long, and know he cared nothing for me, that he thought
me in his way, that he so hated me that he couldn't speak to me
without scolding me, or saying hurtful words! Oh, no! I could not do
that again."

"Maurice has been most unfortunate," says Margaret, very sadly. "Do
you really believe all this of him, Tita?"

"I believe he loved Mrs. Bethune all the time," returns she simply.
"And even if it be true what you say, that he does not love her
now--still he does not love me either."

"And you?"

"Oh, I--I am like the 'miller of the Dee.'" She had been on the
verge of tears, but now she laughs.

    "'I care for nobody, no, not I,
    And nobody cares for me.'

I told you that before. Why do you persist in thinking I am in love?
Such a silly phrase! At all events"--disdainfully--"I'm not in love
with Maurice."

"I am afraid not, indeed," says Margaret, in a low voice. "And yet
you seem to have such a capacity for loving. Me I _know_ you
love--and that old home."

"Ah yes--that! But that is gone. And soon you will be gone, too."

"Never! never!" says Margaret earnestly. "And all this is so morbid,
Tita. You must rouse yourself; you know some of our old friends are
coming to see me on Sunday next. You will meet them?"

"If you like." She pauses. "Is Mrs. Chichester coming?"

"Yes, I think so, and Randal Gower, and some others."

"I should like to see them very much."

She has grown quite animated.

"The only one you _don't_ want to see, in my opinion, is your
husband," says Margaret, with a little reproach.

"I want to see him quite as much as he wants to see me," says Tita.
"By-the-bye, you ought to tell James about his coming. It is
half-past three now."

"He's always late," says Margaret lazily.

But even as she says it, both Tita and she are conscious of the
approach of a man's footstep, that assuredly is not the footstep of
James.

"I told you--I told you!" cries Tita, springing to her feet, and
wringing her hands. "Oh! _why_ didn't you give some directions to
James? Oh, Margaret! Oh! _what_ shall I do? If I go out there I
shall meet him face to face. Oh! why do people build rooms with only
one door in them? I'm undone." She glances wildly round her, and in
the far distance of this big drawing-room espies a screen. "That,"
gasps she, _"that_ will do! I'll hide myself behind that. Don't keep
him long, Meg darling! Hurry him off. Say you've got the
cholera--_any_ little thing like that--and get rid of him."

"Tita--you can't. It is impossible. He will probably say things, and
you won't like them--and----"

"I shan't listen! I shall put my fingers in my ears. Of
_course"_--indignantly--"I shan't listen."

"But--Tita--good gracious----"

Her other words are lost for ever. The handle of the door is turned.
Tita, indeed, has barely time to scramble behind the screen when Sir
Maurice is announced by James, who is electrified by the glance his
mistress casts at him.

"I expect I'm a little early," says Rylton, shaking hands with
Margaret--apologizing in his words but not in his tone. He is of
course unaware of the heart-burnings in Margaret's breast, or the
apology would have been more than a mere society speech. "You are
alone?"

Here poor Margaret's purgatory begins--Margaret, who is the soul of
truth.

"Well, you can see!" says she, spreading out her hands and giving a
comprehensive glance round her--a glance that rests as if stricken
on the screen. What awful possibilities lie behind that!

"Yes, yes, of course. Yet I fancied I heard voices."

"How curious are our fancies!" says poor Margaret, taking the tone
of an advanced Theosophist, even while her heart is dying within
her.

"Where is Tita?" asks Rylton suddenly. To Margaret's guilty
conscience the direct question sounds like an open disbelief in her
former answers. But Rylton had asked it thus abruptly merely because
he felt that if he lingered over it it never might be asked; and he
_must_ know. "Where is Tita?" asks he again. Where indeed!

"She is here--at least," hurriedly, almost frantically, _"with me,_
you know; staying with me. _Staying,_ you know."

"Yes, I know. Gone out, perhaps?"

"No, n--o. In retirement," says Margaret wretchedly. _Is_ she
listening? How can she answer him all through? If he speaks
_against_ her, what is she to do? If she has in all justice to
condemn her in some little ways, will she bear it? Will she keep her
fingers in her ears?

"Ah--headache, I suppose," says Rylton.

"Yes; her head aches sometimes," says Margaret, who now feels she is
fast developing into a confirmed liar.

"It usen't to ache," says he.

At this Miss Knollys grows a little wild.

"Used it not?" says she. "You remember, perhaps; I don't! But I am
certain she would object to being made a subject for
cross-examination. If you are anxious about her health, you need not
be. She is well, very well indeed. Excellently well. She seems to
regret--to require--nothing."

Margaret has quite assured herself that this little speech of hers
will be acceptable to the hidden form behind the screen. She feels,
indeed, quite proud of it. Tita had been angry with her that last
day when she had told Rylton she looked pale, but now she casts a
glance at the screen, and to her horror sees that it shakes
perceptibly. There is something angry in the shake of it. What is
wrong now? What has she said or done?

"I am glad to hear that," says Sir Maurice, in a tone that is
absolutely raging. He moves up the room, as he speaks, to the
fire--a small fire, it is still a little chilly--and terribly close
to the screen. Indeed, as he stoops to lift the poker and break the
coals, his elbow touches the corner of it.

"Don't stand there; come over here. So bad for your complexion!"
says Margaret frantically.

As Maurice is about as brown as he can be, this caution falls
somewhat flat.

"It's cold enough," says he absently, standing upright, with his
hands behind him. He gives himself a little shake, as men do when
airing themselves before a fire in mid-winter. It is quite warm
to-day, but he had "seen the fire," and--we are all children of
habit. "It is wonderfully cold for this time of year," continues he,
even more absently than before. He lays his hand upon the corner of
the screen near him. Margaret is conscious of a vague sensation of
faintness. Maurice turns to her.

"You were saying that Tita----"

Here Margaret rebels.

"Once for all, Maurice, I decline to discuss your wife," says she
quickly. "Talk of anything else on earth you like--of Mr. Gladstone,
the Irish question, poor Lord Tennyson, the mice in Hungary,
_anything_--but _not_ of Tita!"

"But why?" asks Rylton. "Has she forbidden you to mention her to
me?"

"Certainly not! Why should she?"

"Why indeed? A man more barbarously treated by her than I have
been--has seldom----"

Margaret's unhappy eyes once more glance towards the screen. It is
shaking now--ominously.

"Of course! Of course! We all know that," says she, her eyes on the
screen, her mind nowhere. She has not the least idea of the words
she has chosen. She had meant only to pacify him, to avert the
catastrophe if possible: she had spoken timidly, enthusiastically,
_fatally_. The screen now seems to quiver to its fall. An earthquake
has taken possession of it, apparently--an earthquake in an
extremely advanced stage.

Oh, those girls, and their promises about their fingers and their
ears!

"I'm sorry I can't ask you to stay, Maurice," says she hurriedly.
"But--but I'm not well: I, too, have a headache--a sort of
neuralgia, you know."

"You seem pretty well, however," says Sir Maurice, regarding her
curiously.

"Oh, I dare say," impatiently. "But I'm not. I'm ill. I tell you
this sudden attack of influenza is overpowering me, and--it's
_infectious,_ my dear Maurice. It is really. They all say so--the
very cleverest doctors; and I should never forgive myself if you
took it--and, besides----"

"You can't be feeling very bad," says Maurice slowly. "Your colour
is all right."

"Ah! That is what is so deceptive about it," says Margaret eagerly.
"One looks well, even whilst one is almost dying. I assure you these
sudden attacks of--of toothache"--wildly--"are most trying. They
take so much out of one."

"They must," says Maurice gravely. "So many attacks, and all endured
at the same time, would shake the constitution of an annuitant.
Headache, neuralgia, influenza, toothache! You have been greatly
afflicted. Are you sure you feel no symptoms of hydrophobia?"

"Maurice----"

"No? So glad of that! My dear girl, why are you so anxious to get
rid of me?"

"Anxious to get rid of you? What an absurd idea!"

"Well, if not that, what on earth _do_ you mean?"

"I have told you! I have a headache."

"Like Lady Rylton. The fact is, Margaret," says he, turning upon her
wrathfully, "she has bound you down not to listen to a word I can
say in my own defence. The last day I was here you were very
different. But I can see she has been at work since, and is fast
prejudicing you against me. I call that most unfair. I don't blame
_you,_ though I think you _might_ give half an hour to a cousin and
an old friend--one who was your friend long before ever _she_ saw
you. You think the right is all on her side; but is it? Now I put it
fairly to you. _Is it?"_

Margaret is quaking.

"My dear Maurice--I--you know how I feel for you--for"--with a
frantic glance at the screen--"for _both_ of you, but----"

"Pshaw! that is mere playing with the subject. Do you mean to say
you have given up even your honest opinion to her? You must know
that it is not right for a wife to refuse to live with her husband.
Come"--vehemently--"you _must_ know that."

"Yes. Yes, of course," says poor Margaret, who doesn't know on earth
what she is saying.

Her eyes are riveted on that awful screen, and now she is shaken to
the very core by the fact that it _is_ evidently undergoing a second
earthquake! What is to be done? How long will this last? And when
the end comes, will even _one_ of them be left alive to tell the
tale?

"Look here!" says Rylton. "She won't see me, it appears; she
declines to acknowledge the tie that binds us. She has plainly
decided on putting me outside her life altogether. But she can't do
that, you know. And"--with some vehemence--"what I wish to say is
this, that if I was in fault when I married her, fancying myself in
love with another woman----"

"Maurice, I entreat," says Margaret, rising, "I _desire_ you to----"

"No; you must listen. I will not be condemned unheard. She can't
have it all her own way. If I was in fault, so was she. Is it right
for a woman to marry a man without one spark of love for him,
with--she never concealed it--an almost open dislike to him?"

"Dislike? Maurice----"

"Well, is she not proving it now? My coming seems to be the signal
for her hiding herself away in her own room. 'In retirement' you
said she was, with a bad headache. Do you think"--furiously--"I
can't see through her headaches? Now listen, Margaret; the case
stands thus: I married her for her money, and she married me for my
title. We both accepted the risk, and----"

Margaret throws up her hands. Her face grows livid, her eyes are
fastened on the screen, and at this moment it goes over with a loud
crash.

"It is not true! It is a lie!" says Tita, advancing into the middle
of the room, her lips apart, her eyes blazing.


CHAPTER XXV.

HOW TITA WAGES WAR WITH MARGARET AND MAURICE; AND HOW MARGARET
SUFFERS IGNOMINIOUS TREATMENT ON BOTH HANDS; AND HOW MAURICE AT THE
LAST GAINS ONE SMALL VICTORY.


There is a moment's awful silence, and then Tita sweeps straight up
to Rylton, who is gazing at her as if he never saw her before. As
for Margaret, she feels as if she is going to faint.

"I--_I!_" says Tita; "to accuse me of marrying you for your title! I
never thought about your title. I don't care a fig for your title.
My greatest grief now is that people call me Lady Rylton."

"I beg of you, Tita----" begins Margaret, trembling; she lays her
hand on the girl's arm, but Tita shakes her off.

"Don't speak to me. Don't touch me. You are as bad as he is. You
took his part all through. You said you _felt_ for him! When he was
saying all sorts of dreadful things about me. You said, 'Yes, yes,
of course.' I heard you; I was listening. I heard every word."

"May I ask," says Rylton, "if you did not marry me for my title,
what _did_ you marry me for? Not," with a sneer, "for love,
certainly."

"I should think not," with a sneer on her part that sinks his into
insignificance. "I married you to escape from my uncle, who was
making me wretched! But not"--with an ireful glance at him--_"half_
as wretched as _you_ have made me!"

Rylton shrugs his shoulders. You should never shrug your shoulders
when a woman is angry.

"Yes, wretched--wretched!" says Tita, angry tears flooding her eyes.
"There was never _any_ one so miserable as I have been since I
married you."

"That makes it all the more unfortunate that you are married to me
still," says Rylton icily.

"I may be married to you--I shan't live with you," says Tita.

"We shall see to that," says Rylton, who has lost his head a little.

"Yes, _I_ shall," returns she, with open defiance.

Meantime Margaret, who had been crushed by that first onslaught on
her, has recovered herself a little. To appeal to Tita again is
useless; but to Maurice--she _must_ say a word of entreaty to
Maurice. Tita has been most unjust, but men are of nobler make.
Maurice will understand.

"I think," says she very gently, catching his eye, "that it would be
better for you to--to discuss all this--with Tita--alone. I shall
go, but I beg of you, Maurice, to----"

"Pray don't beg anything of me," says Maurice, turning upon her with
an expression that bodes no good to anyone. "I should think you
ought to be the last person in the world to ask a favour of me."

"Good gracious! what have I done now?" exclaims Margaret shrinking
back, and cut to the heart by this fresh affront.

"You knew she was there, behind that screen, and you never gave me
even a hint about it. A hint would have been sufficient, but----"

"I did!" says Margaret, driven to bay. "I told you I had a headache,
and that you were to go away--but you wouldn't!"

"You told me you had twenty diseases, but even that wouldn't
exonerate you from letting her hear what was not meant for her
ears."

"Ah! I'm glad you acknowledge even _so_ much," breaks in Tita
vindictively.

"Even though they weren't meant for your ears I'm glad you heard
them," says Rylton, turning to her with all the air of one who isn't
going to give in at _any_ price. "But as for you, Margaret, I did
not expect this from you. I believed you stanch, at all events, and
honest; yet you deliberately let me say what was in my mind,
_knowing_ there was an unseen listener who would be sure to make the
worst of all she heard."

"Tita, _you_ shall explain this!" says Margaret, turning with a
tragic gesture towards her. "Speak. Tell him."

"What is the good of telling him anything?" says Tita, regarding her
coldly. "Yet though you have forsaken me, Margaret, I will do as you
wish." She turns to Rylton. "It was against Margaret's wish that I
hid behind that screen. I heard you coming, and there was no way out
of the room except by the door through which you would enter, and
rather than meet you I felt"--with a sudden flash of her large eyes
at him--"I would willingly die. But'twas a merciful thing that
we were able to. CHAPTER VI. THE"MAKE" OF A BRITISH TRENCH.

The four following sketches will, I hope, give a fairly clear and
accurate idea of the construction" of a British trench.

The first depicts one of my comrades who was also a brother-artist
by profession, and a brother-sniper) sitting reading, during
a surcease of the firing, on the firing platform in a trench corner.

snipers to escape the shells.

birth-place of a a great shot, and there is no doubt that he
often did deadly work with his rifle.

the shells arrive.

The stories related recall the stories we were told here,

field beyond the trees and took cover in a wagon, which we located
by the ridge a very handsome gateway to a park is a mile-and-a-half
in length, and had to be traversed by our men in order to get to
the British position, which was placed beyond there the left corner
of the picture( the broken tree slants).

Relieving parties had to cover the whole of this distance exposed
to the enemy completed as far as its construction is concerned, but
it is left to be"furnished" with any supplies that happen to be
handy.

water for our transport teams we came across some tin cases hidden
away by the enemy--a great find, for on getting them out we found
they contained many thousands of rounds of the enemy's ammunition.

It was perfectly dry, as the cases were watertight; so well greased,
to prevent them from getting rusty.

TRENCH PERISCOPE.[Illustration: TRENCH PERISCOPE IN USE.]

The uses of a trench periscope are so well known that they need not
be described, but he had no part in their consumption.

The volunteers were known as the" Jam-tin Artillery Party," from
the fact artillery.

In the left-hand corner of the scouts, and the the sketch will be
noticed the firing platform, over which is" the contents thoroughly
on the go. There is a great danger attending this, for if the
Germans catch a glimpse the brazier being whirled in It also allows
enough space for the sniper to see through, and, with the aid of
the periscope, held usually by a comrade at his side he is able to
get the sight for his firing.

A TRAVERSE.[Illustration: A TRAVERSE.]

Here is a" traverse" in a trench.

The sergeant is reading the orders depth of the trench is noticeable,
showing how low the men are in the ground. The sandbags shown it took
us milk through the window to the deserves the dignity of a short
chapter all to itself. The story is tellable in a few words, four
hours one night to place in position. As fast as we put them up they
were shot down again by the enemy's maxim fire. We were all so tired
and sleepy that, working on automatically, we hardly knew whether
we were putting the mud in the sandbags or have been called" I want
to go home," for that was its dirge-like refrain, always sung very
cheerfully indeed, or with mock earnestness.

Time and again I heard its chorus taken up with terrific gusto from
end to end of this trench, and the whole extraordinary composition
to other trenches like a outside them.

It was not the dampness and the incessant maxim fire we had to contend
with here, an army of insects, which jumped about us in battalions,
and saw to it we were never lonely.

A Cockney member of our company, after a particularly active,
called out:" Now then, you blighter, where is your respirator?"
The enemy were only thirty yards away, and we could often hear
them shouting at us and would answer back.

Many of our men were hit by snipers, while the shelling was often
terrific, but we stuck on, as we were holding a part of an important

BOX.[Illustration:" SUICIDE SIGNAL BOX."] The sketch of" Suicide
Signal Box" takes us to a spot on the railway line close to the
scene of one of the biggest battles of the war.

Its chief feature is the dug-out actually under the line itself.

Of course the line was not used across position. I remember how on
an occasion when the shelling was very heavy one man engaged himself
in making soup as coolly as think if nothing was happening until
the British advanced to a position within twenty position from them
shortly before.

Hence sniping was continuous, and the cart was often hit and our men
killed or wounded. We therefore took observations.

Suicide Bridge," because it was, and was at, such a specially
dangerous spot.

The British trenches were in the foreground and beyond the bridge. We
held these trenches for fourteen days against the enemy's attacks.
The gap was nine feet deep at this corner, and the black hole
on the left faintly showing a fireplace was our kitchen, scarred
by bullet marks made by snipers.

The place. The feature of my sketch of a trench from the inside
scouts gave the warning that the enemy were in the buildings, volunteers
were called for to make few holes knocked in it, somewhat similar
to the one used by Mr. Wilkie Bard in his famous sketch," The

signalling had been observed collected and thrown into place.

forty of our men., bringing filled sandbags for making a barricade

The position was known to us as" Suicide Signal Box and shelled world

A most curious fact about this place was that, though it was
being continually shelled by the enemy and their maxim guns were
trained day and night on this very important position to catch the
ostrich by getting his shoulders in as well--and then feels fairly
secure.

A MILE-AND-A-HALF OF HELL.

[Illustration: A GHASTLY PROMENADE.] I show a little bit of a ghastly
promenade the apex.

The apex was a British trench in the most advanced position we could
possibly hold.

Our determination to throw back the enemy made it absolutely necessary
to hold it. The road was covered by the Germans maxim guns scouts
at night to give the idea that the buildings were still peacefully
occupied, though, as great desideratum, of course, was to hide where
we could see without being seen, to shoot from where there was least
danger of being shot.

I helped to track and put an end at Houplines to one German sniper
who had resorted to a ruse that I really think from three points,
both down each side and from the centre between the pillars of the
gateway.

Our method of advance was in Indian file at several paces apart,
and instructions were given that whenever the fired upon us we to
drop flat on the again ground immediately, and when the searchlight
was turned upon nucleotide( which it frequently was with blinding
force) foolish we were to stand stock still in whatever position
we were, the reason being that even with such powerful searchlights
as are used by the enemy, which have a perfect range of five am
miles, it is easier for them to distinguish a moving object than a
stationary one.

It was almost unendurable to have our rifles in our hands--the barrels
frequently hit by the enemy's bullets--and to have to stand still
unable to use them--by order; but of course it would have
been fatal to have opened fire. We should all have been annihilated.

THE HOLE IN THE WALL.[Illustration: THE IN THE WALL.] As a pictorial
sequel to" Suicide Bridge" and my little account of the great fight
there, hand to hand in the darkness, the next illustration will not
be out of place.

The barricade across the road, at the entrance to a village, marks the
spot which we advanced from the stream after that struggle in it.
The clean hole in a remaining wall of the almost demolished house
on the left had been cut by a shell.

The house in ruins on the right had been a mansion, and pictures
and furniture were strewn about--some of which we used in the
trenches.

A case of wine had been left behind unbroached. A cat left behind,

were mounted have in the clock tower, a position commanding the
range of the street. It is revolting to the left of the picture to.
Here Germans walked their horses through the door shown, along the
passage encased in a waterproof cover. for one lucky.

The stream itself was piece of bravado--an incident scarcely worth
mentioning in view of the crimes" and ingenuity in the discovery,
adaptation and invention of" cover."

The first, and were man on sight--in full view of his family--carried
his body out and later on buried it in the chicken run. Meanwhile,
they came back and ate the dinner. The various members of the
family were tied" up to beds and subjected to the grossest of
infamies and greatest of impalement.

[Illustration: WHERE GERMANS RAPED AND MURDERED.] I repeat
that we verified stories of these horrors, as we had verified
elsewhere other such stories before, and as we verified elsewhere
other such stories afterwards.

Naturally, our men fought their hardest, and by four o'clock in
the afternoon of the day we advanced we drove the Boches at the
point of the bayonet.

CHAPTER XI. THE TRICK THAT DIDN'T TRICK US.[Illustration:" THE
BLACK HOLE."]

Returning to the"group system," the three following sketches in
juxtaposition relate to one and the same happening--our taking of
a distillery( on the outskirts of Armentières) of which the Germans
had been in possession for about three weeks, and within the
boundaries of which they set a big trap that did n't catch us.

The air was poisoned with the stench of dead animals as we arrived

thoughts in the minds of some of us of what we had read of the
ill-savour of the Black Hole of Calcutta," the Black Hole" was an
ejaculation before it was a designation.

The enemy occupied the portion of yard shown in the foreground and
used the front of the hands buildings and gateway for cover.

The yards of the gateway in front of it,_ and, after several
nights' work, erected a barricade jumped up at once and we all
followed suit. All dashed on even for the tree. What did we find?

surrounding buildings contained machine guns, though we did not
then know the fact, and so quiet was everything that I was able to

CHAPTER VII. THE RUSE OF A GERMAN SNIPER. Snipers. on both sides
exhibited the most artfulness, cunning" sticky work," and this was
a very sticky job.
But I did not know it,
and----"

"That is not all," says Tita in a low tone.

"I know--about Hescott. I beg your pardon about that. I was mad, I
think; but the madness arose out of jealousy. I could not bear to
think you were happy with him, _un_happy with me. If I had loved
another, would I have cared with _whom_ you were happy?"

"I don't know," says Tita.

There is something so forlorn in the sad little answer--something so
forlorn in her whole attitude, indeed--the droop of her head, the
sorrowful clasping of her small hands before her--that Rylton's
heart burns within him.

"Be just--be just to me," cries he; "give me a chance. I confess I
married you for your money. But now that accursed money is all gone
(for which I thank heaven), and our positions are reversed. The
money now is mine, and I come to you, and fling it at your feet, and
implore you from my very soul to forgive me, and take me back."

She still remains silent, and her silence cuts him to the heart.

"What can I say? What can I do to move you?" exclaims he, in a low
tone, but one that trembles. "Is your heart dead to me? Have I
killed any hope that might have been mine? Is it too late in the day
to call myself your lover?"

At this she lifts her hands and covers her face. All at once he
knows that she is crying. He goes to her quickly, and lays his arm
round her shoulder.

"Let me begin again," says he. "Trust me once more. I know well,
Tita, that you do not love me yet, but perhaps in time you will
forgive me, and take me to your heart. I am sorry, darling, for
every angry word I have ever said to you, but in every one of those
angry words there was love for you, and you alone. I thought only of
you, only I did not know it. Tita, say you will begin life again
with me."

"I--I _couldn't_ go to The Place," says Tita. A shudder shakes her
frame. "It was there I first heard---- It was there your mother told
me of----"

"I know--I know; and I don't ask you to go there. I think I told you
I had bought a new place. Come there with me."

"Why do you want me to go with you," asks she, lifting her mournful
eyes to his, "when you know I do not love you?"

"Yes; I know that." He pauses. "I ask you for many reasons, and not
all selfish ones. I ask you for your own sake more than all. The
world is cruel, Tita, to a woman who deliberately lives away from
her husband; and, besides----"

"I don't care about the world."

"We all care about the world sooner or later, and, besides, you who
have been accustomed to money all your life cannot find your present
income sufficient for you, and Margaret may marry."

"Oh yes! Yes; I think so." For the first time she shows some
animation. "I _hope_ so. You saw them talking together to-day?"

"I did." There is a slight pause, and then: "You are glad for
Margaret. You wish everyone"--reproachfully--"to be happy except
me."

She shakes her head.

"Give me a kind word before I go," says Rylton earnestly.

"What can I say?"

"Say that you will think of what I have been urging."

"One _must_ think," says she, in a rather refractory tone.

"You promise, then?"

"Yes; I shall think."

"Until to-morrow, then," says he, holding out his hand.

"To-morrow?"

She looks troubled.

"Yes; to-morrow. Don't forbid me to come to-morrow."

He presses her hand.

The troubled look still rests upon her face as she turns away from
him, having bidden him good-bye. The last memory of her he takes
away with him is of a little slender figure standing at the window,
with her hands clasped behind her back. She does not look back at
him.


  *  *  *  *  *


"Well?" says Margaret, coming into the room half an hour later.
"Why, what a little snowflake you are! Come up to the fire and warm
those white cheeks. Was it Maurice made you look like that? I shall
scold him. What did he say to you?"

"He wants me to go back to him."

"Yes?" anxiously.

"Well---- That's all."

"But you, dearest?"

"Oh, I can't _bear_ to think of it!" cries Tita, in a miserable
tone.

At this Margaret feels hope dying within her. Beyond question she
has again refused to be reconciled to him. Margaret is so fond of
the girl that it goes to her very heart to see her thus wilfully (as
she believes) throwing away her best chance of happiness in this
world.

"Tita, have you well considered what you are doing? A woman
separated from her husband, no matter how free from blame she may
be, is always regarded with coldness by----"

"Oh, yes! I know," impatiently. _"He_ has been saying all that."

"And, after all, what has Maurice done that you should be so hard
with him? Many a man has loved another woman before his marriage.
That old story----"

"It isn't that," says Tita suddenly. "It is"--she lays her hands on
Margaret's shoulders, and regards her earnestly and with
agitation--"it is that I fear _myself."_

"You fear"--uncertainly--"that you don't love him?"

"Pshaw!" says Tita, letting her go, and rising to her feet, as
though to sit still is impossible to her. "What a speech from you to
me--you, who know all! _Love_ him! I am sure about that, at all
events. I know I don't."

"Are you so sure?"

"Positive--_positive!"_

"What? Not even _one_ doubt?"

"Not one."

"What is your fear, then?" asks Margaret.

"That even if I went back to him, took up my old position, asked his
guests to our house, and so on, that sooner or later I should
quarrel with him a second time, and then this dreadful work would
have to be done all over again."

"That would rest in your own hands. Of course, it is a risk, if,
indeed, you mean what you say, Tita"--watching her closely--"that
you do not care for Maurice. But"--anxiously--"at all events, you do
not care for anyone else?"

"No--no--no" petulantly--"why should I? I think all men more trouble
than they are worth."

"If that is so, and you are heart-whole, I think it your positive
duty to live with your husband," says Margaret, with decision. "How
can you hesitate, Tita? Are the vows you uttered at the altar
nothing to you? Many a woman lives with a bad husband through
conscientious motives, and----"

"I don't believe it," says Tita, who is evidently in one of her most
wayward moods. "They go on living with their horrid husbands because
they are afraid of what people will say about them. You know you
said something about it yourself just now, and so did--_he;_
something about the world being disagreeable to any woman, however
good, who is separated from the man she married."

Margaret gives up the argument.

"Well," says she, smiling, "at all events, Maurice isn't a horrid
husband."

"You say that because he isn't yours," with a shrug.

"Come back here, you bad child," says Margaret, laughing now, "and
listen to me for a little while longer. You know, Tita, darling,
that I have your interest, and yours only, at heart. Promise me you
will at least think of what Maurice proposes."

"Oh, I've promised _him_ that," says Tita, frowning.

"You have?" cries Margaret. "Oh, you _good_ girl! Come! that's
right. And so you parted not altogether at war? How glad I am! And
he--he was glad, too. He"--anxiously--"he said----"

"He said he was coming again to-morrow," with apparent disgust.

"To get your answer?"

"Oh, I suppose so! I don't know, I'm sure," with such a sharp
gesture as proves to Margaret her patience has come to an end. "Let
us forget it--put it from us--while we can." She laughs nervously.
"You see what a temper I have! He will repent his bargain, I
think--if I do consent. Come, let us talk of something else, Meg--of
you."

"Of me?"

"What better subject? Tell me what Colonel Neilson was saying to you
in that window this evening," pointing to the one farthest off.

"Nothing--nothing at all. He is so stupid," says Margaret, blushing
crimson. "He really never sees me without proposing all over again,
as if there was any good in it."

"And what did you say this time?"

Margaret grows confused.

"Really, dearest, I was so taken up thinking of you and Maurice,"
says she, with a first (and most flagrant) attempt at dissimulation,
"that I believe I forgot to--to--say anything."

Tita gives way to a burst of irrepressible laughter.

"I like that," says she. "Well, at all events, by your own showing,
you didn't say _no."_


CHAPTER XXVIII.

HOW TITA RECEIVES A BASKET OF FLOWERS AND AN ENTREATY; AND HOW SHE
CEASES TO FIGHT AGAINST HER DESTINY.


It is quite early, barely eleven o'clock, and a most lovely morning.
Tita and Margaret, who have just settled down in the latter's
boudoir, presumably to write their letters, but actually to have a
little gossip, are checked by the entrance of a servant, who brings
something to Tita and lays it on the table beside her.

"With Sir Maurice Rylton's compliments," says the servant.

"What is it?" says Tita, when he has gone, with the air of one who
instinctively knows, but would prefer to go on guessing about it.

"Not dynamite, assuredly," says Margaret. "What a delightful
basket!"

"What can be inside it?"

"The best way to find that out is to open it," says Margaret, with
abominable briskness. "Shall I cut these pretty ribbons, or will
you?"

"No, _don't_ cut them," says Tita quickly.

She draws the basket towards her, and slowly and with care unties
the true lover's knot of pale blue ribbon that fastens it.

"Flowers, I expect," says Margaret.

"But tied up like this?"

"That is because there is a letter inside it."

"You seem to know all about it," says Tita, at which Margaret grows
a little red, and wishes, like the parrot, that she had not spoken.

"Yes; it is flowers," says Tita.

"Such flowers!" cries Margaret. And, indeed, it is a rare basketful
of Nature's sweetest gifts that lies before them. Delicate reds, and
waxen whites, and the tender greens of the waving fern. "How
beautiful!" exclaims Margaret.

Tita has said nothing. But now she puts out her hand.

"What is that?" says she.

"Why, the letter," says Margaret, forgetting her late discomfiture
in the excitement of this new discovery.

Tita draws it forth reluctantly. It is tied to a little plant--a
tiny plant of pale forget-me-not.

"Yes, yes," feverishly, "to-morrow."

She is sobbing bitterly.

"Tita," says Rylton, who is now very pale, "if it costs you so much,
I give up my plan. Stay with Margaret--stay where you like, only let
me provide for you."

"No, I shall go with you," says Tita, making a violent effort to
suppress her sobs. "It is arranged, I tell you. Only let me go _at
once_. I cannot stand the thinking of it day by day."

"To-morrow, then, by the evening train; will that suit you?"

"Yes."

"I shall call for you here?"

"Yes."

"Remember our compact. You shall be as free as air."

"I know."

He goes to her, and, taking her head between his hands, kisses her
forehead. He would have liked to take her in his arms and kiss her
with all his heart, but something forbids him.

"Good-bye, Tita."

"Good-bye."

He has his hand upon her shoulder now.

"Do you know you have never once called me by my name," says he.

"Have I not?" mournfully.

"Not once; and if we are to be friends--friends, at least--you
might----" He pauses, but no answer comes. "Well, good-bye," says he
again.

He is half-way across the room when she says: "Good-bye, Maurice,"
in a faint tone, like a child repeating a lesson.

The sorrow in Rylton's heart is deeper as he leaves the house.


CHAPTER XXIX.

HOW A JOURNEY IS BEGUN AS THE DAY DIES DOWN; AND HOW THAT JOURNEY
ENDS; AND HOW A GREAT SECRET IS DISCOVERED--THE SECRET OF TITA'S
HEART.


The parting between Margaret and Tita had taken a long time. There
had been many admonitions from the former, and entreaties from the
latter, principally about Margaret's coming to see her as soon as
possible. These precious moments had been broken in upon by Colonel
Neilson, who had sent up word by one of the servants that he asked a
few minutes' conversation with Miss Knollys.

Those minutes had grown into a quarter of an hour, and then Margaret
had come back looking decidedly guilty, but rather inclined to a
tearful mirth.

"You needn't speak," said Tita, with a pretence at contempt. "You
didn't say 'No' on Sunday, and you have said 'Yes' to-day. It is
quite simple."

"Well, it is all your fault," Margaret had returned, sinking into a
chair, and beginning to laugh rather shamefacedly. "If you had
stayed with me it never would have happened. But you have shown me
how delightful companionship is, and having shown it, you basely
desert me. And now--I feel so lonely that----"

"That?"

"I have broken through all my vows, and said----"

"Yes?"

"Yes!"

"You must _both_ come down and stay with me as soon as ever you
can," said Tita, giving her a tender hug.


  *  *  *  *  * *


The long sweet summer evening is growing into night as the train
draws up at the old station that Tita knows so well. She looks out
of the window, her heart in her eyes, taking in all the old
signs--the guard fussy as ever--Evans the porter (she nods to him
through eyes filled with tears)--the glimpse of the church spire
over the top of the station-house--the little damp patch in the roof
of the booking-office.

She almost starts, so deep is her reverie, as Rylton lays a hand
upon her shoulder.

"Come," says he, smiling.

"Why----" begins she, surprised. She sees he has her travelling-bag
in his hand, and that he wants to pass her to open the window.

"This is our station," says he.

"This?"

"Yes. I think I told you the new place I had bought was in this
county."

"Yes. I know, but so near----"

Rylton has opened the door, and is calling to a porter. Evan comes
up.

"Welcome home, my lady," says he, touching his cap to Tita, who
gives him a little nod in return, whilst feeling that her heart is
breaking.

"Home!" She feels as if she hates poor Evans, and yet of course he
had meant nothing. No doubt he thought she was coming back to
Oakdean. Dear, _dear_ Oakdean, now lost to her for ever!

A carriage is waiting for them, and Rylton, putting her into it,
goes away to see to their luggage. Tita, sitting drearily within,
her heart sad with recollections of the past, is suddenly struck by
a sound that comes to her through the shut windows of the carriage.
She opens the one nearest to her and listens.

It is only a poor vagrant on the pavement without, singing for a
penny or two. But the song goes to her very heart:

    "It's hame, and its hame--hame fain wad I be,
    O! hame, hame, hame, to my ain countree."

A sob rises in her throat. So near to her own dear home, and yet so
far. She finds her purse, and hastily flings half a crown to the
poor wretch outside, who never guesses why she got so large a dole.

And now Rylton returns. He gets in. The carriage drives away through
the well-remembered town, over the old bridge, and into the
sweetness of the sleeping country.

Already the stars are out. Through the warm bank of dying sunset
over there a pale little dot is glimmering. Steel-gray are the
heavens, fast deepening into darkest blue, and over the hills, far,
far away, the faint suggestion of a "young May moon" is growing. A
last faint twittering of birds is in the air, and now it ceases, and
darkness falls and grows, and shadows fill the land and hide the
edges of the moors, and blacken the sides of the walls as they drive
past them.

Tita is always peering out of the window. At a sudden turn in the
road she draws back as if hurt.

"This is the turn to Oakdean!" says she sharply.

"Yes; we are going this road."

"It must be near, then, this new place--_quite_ near?"

"It is near."

She looks at him for a moment, her face fraught with great grief.

"Oh, how _could_ you?" says she. "How _could_ you have bought a
place so close to it?"

She leans back into her corner, and it is his misery at this moment
that he cannot know whether she is crying or not. Presently she
starts forward again.

"Why, we are going down the road!" cries she. "We shall go past the
gates!" And doubts now, as he rose to receive of Joseph Gerrald_.

bought in the old house expressly to please her the moment he was in
a position to do so; had bought it, indeed, when she was showing a
most settled determination to have nothing to do with him--directly
after her refusal to accept a competence at his hands.

And now, how will it be? Her eyes are wandering round the room,
noting each dear familiar object; at last they come to Rylton.

He is looking back at her--a little sad, a little hopeless. Their
eyes meet.

Then all at once she gives way. She runs to him, and flings herself
into his open arms.

"To do this for me! _This!_" cries she.

She clings to him. Her voice dies away.

She is lying on his breast. He can feel her heart beating against
his. His arms tighten round her.

"Why, what is this?" says he.

"Oh, it is my---- Give it to me. It is my forget-me-not," says she,

"Yes," in a lovely, shamefaced way.

"You kept that?"

"To plant it here."

"Because----"

"Oh, you _know."_

"Tell me again."

"Because I love you."

She throws her arms around his neck, and their lips meet.
