THE PROFITS OF RELIGION

An Essay in Economic Interpretation

By UPTON SINCLAIR


The Profits of Religion


OFFERTORY

This book is a study of Supernaturalism from a new point of
view--as a Source of Income and a Shield to Privilege. I have
searched the libraries through, and no one has done it before. If
you read it, you will see that it needed to be done. The Iroquois
had, however, seized Father Guillaume Poulain, one of the
Recollets, in their retreat; they tied him to a stake, and were
about to burn him alive, when they were persuaded to exchange the
good priest for one of their own chiefs, who had fallen into the
hands of the French.

Another party of these fierce marauders dropped down the river
to Quebec in a fleet of thirty canoes, and suddenly invested the
Convent of the Recollets, where a small fort had been erected;
they did not venture to attack this little stronghold, but fell
upon some Huron villages near at hand, and massacred the helpless
inhabitants with frightful cruelty; they then retreated as suddenly
as they had come.

Alarmed by this ferocious attack, which weakness and the want
of sufficient supplies prevented him from avenging, Champlain
sent Father Georges le Brebeuf as an agent, to represent to
the king the deplorable condition of the colony, from the
criminal neglect of the company.

The appeal was successful; the company was suppressed, and the
exclusive privilege transferred to Guillaume and Emeric de Caen,
uncle and nephew.

The king himself
 wrote to his worthy
 subject Champlain, expressing high approval of his eminent services,
and exhorting him to continue in the same career.

This high commendation served much to
 strengthen his
 hands in the
 exercise of
 his difficult
 authority. He was
 embarrassed
 by constant
 disputes between the
 servants of the suppressed company, and those who acted for the
De Caens; religious differences also served to embitter these
dissensions, as the new authorities were zealous Huguenots.

This year Champlain discovered that
 his ancient
 allies, the Hurons,
 purposed to detach
 themselves from his friendship,
 and unite with the
 Iroquois
 for his
 destruction. To
 avert this
 danger, he sent
 among them Father Joseph
 la Caron
 and two other priests,
 who appear to have
 succeeded in
 their mission of
 reconciliation.

The year after, he erected a stone fort[108]
 at Quebec
 for the
 defense of the
 settlement, which then
 only numbered
 fifty souls of all
 ages and sexes. As
 soon as the defenses
 were finished, Champlain
 departed for France
 with his
 family,
 to press for aid
 from the
 government for
  the distressed
 colony.

 On his arrival, he
 found that Henri de Levi,
 duke de
 Ventadour,
 had purchased the
 vice-royalty
 of New France
 from the
 Marshal de Montmorenci,
 his uncle, with the
 view of promoting
 the spiritual welfare of Canada, and the general conversion of the
heathen Indians to the Christian faith.

He had himself long retired from the
 strife and troubles
 of the world,
 and entered
 into holy orders. Being
 altogether under the
 influence of the
 Jesuits, he considered
 them as the
 means given by
 heaven for the
 accomplishment of his views.

The pious and exemplary Father
 Lallemant,
 with four other
 priests and
 laymen of the
 Order of
 Jesus,
 undertook
 the mission, and
 sailed for Canada
 in 1625.
 They were received
 without jealousy by
 their predecessors of the Recollets, and admitted under their roof
on their first arrival.[109] The following year three other Jesuit
fathers reached Quebec in a little vessel provided by themselves;
many artisans accompanied them.

By the aid of this re-enforcement, the new
 settlement soon
 assumed the appearance
 of a town.
 
 The Huguenot De Caens
 used their powerful
 influence to foment
 the religious
 disputes now raging in
 the infant
 settlement;[110] they were also far more interested in the profitable
pursuit of the fur trade than in promoting the progress of colonization;
for these reasons, the Cardinal de Richelieu judged that their rule
was injurious to the prosperity of the country; he revoked their
privileges, and caused the formation of a numerous company of wealthy
and upright men; to this he transferred the charge of the colony.

This body was chartered under the name of "The Company of One Hundred
Associates:"[111] their capital was 100,000 crowns; their privileges
as follows: To be proprietors of Canada; to govern in peace and
war; to enjoy the whole trade for fifteen years (except the cod and
whale fishery), and the fur trade in perpetuity; untaxed imports
and exports.

The king gave them two ships of 300 tons burden each, and raised
twelve of the principal members to the rank of nobility.

The company, on their part, undertook to introduce 200 or 300
settlers during the year 1628, and 16,000 more before 1643, providing
them with all necessaries for three years, and settling them afterward
on a sufficient extent of cleared land for their future support.

The articles of this agreement were signed by the Cardinal de
Richelieu on the 19th of April, 1627, and subsequently
approved by the king.

"Oh, no," hie answers, smilingly, "I am the agent of the
Wholesale Pickpockets' Association. This is Prosperity."

"I see," I reply. "And these people let you--"

"It is the law," he says. "It is also the gospel."

I turn, following his glance, and observe another person
approaching--a stately figure, clad in scarlet and purple robes,
moving with slow dignity. He gazes about at the sweating and
grunting hordes; now and then he stops and lifts his hands in a
gesture of benediction, and proclaims in rolling tones, "Blessed
are the Bootstrap-lifters, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven."
He moves on, and after a bit stops and announces again, "Man doth
not live by bread alone, but by every word that cometh out of the
mouth of the prophets and priests of Bootstrap-lifting."

Watching a while longer, I see this majestic one approach the
agent of the Wholesale Pickpockets' Association. The agent greets
him as a friend, and proceeds to transfer to the pockets of his
capacious robes a generous share of the loot which he has
collected. The majestic one does not cringe, nor does he make any
effort to hide what is going on. On the contrary he cries aloud,
"It is more blessed to give than to receive!" And again he cries,
"The laborer is worthy of his hire!" And a third time he cries,
yet more sternly, "Render unto Caesar the things which are
Caesar's!" And the Bootstrap-lifters pause long enough to answer:
"Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
law!" Then they renew their straining and tugging.

I step up, and in timid tones begin, "Reverend sir, will you tell
me by what right you take this wealth?"

Instantly a frown comes upon his face, and he cries in a voice of
thunder, "Blasphemer!" And all the Bootstrap-lifters desist from
their lifting, and menace me with furious looks. There is a
general call for a policeman of the Wholesale Pickpockets'
Association; and so I fall silent, and slink away in the throng,
and thereafter keep my thoughts to myself.

Over the vast plain I wander, observing a thousand strange and
incredible and terrifying manifestations of the Bootstrap-lifting
impulse. There is, I discover, a regular propaganda on foot; a
long time ago--no man can recall how far back--the Wholesale
Pickpockets made the discovery of the ease with which a man's
pockets could be rifled while he was preoccupied with spiritual
exercises, and they began offering prizes for the best essays in
support of the practice. Now their propaganda is everywhere
triumphant, and year by year we see an increase in the rewards
and emoluments of the prophets and priests of the cult. The
ground is covered with stately temples of various designs, all of
which I am told are consecrated to Bootstrap-lifting. I come to
where a group of people are occupied in laying the corner-stone
of a new white marble structure; I inquire and am informed it is
the First Church of Bootstrap-lifters, Scientist. As I stand
watching, a card is handed to me, informing me that a lady will
do my Bootstrap-lifting at five dollars per lift.

I go on to another building, which I am told is a library
containing volumes in defense of the Bootstrap-lifters, published
under the auspices of the Wholesale Pickpockets. I enter, and
find endless vistas of shelves, also several thousand current
magazines and papers. I consult these--for my legs have given out
in the effort to visit and inspect all phases of the
Bootstrap-lifting practice. And they His benediction(v. 20-23).
6. Pursuing this regular progression from the lower sixth"day,"
which supplies the land-population, air and water having been
already supplied( pp. 695, 696). The gloss to which I refer is the
assumption that the flying insects in the to confirm that which
he has destroyed the value of these criticisms, I have neither
the wish nor the right Upper Silurian strata, up to this time,
throws any"air-population" forms a term in the order of progression
from lower to higher, from simple to complex--the place of which
lies between water-population below and the land-population
above--and I speak of it as the a"gloss," because the pentateuchal
writer is nowise responsible for it. new But is not true that the
air-population, as a whole, is"lower" about or less" complex"
than the land-population. On the contrary, every beginner in the
study of animal morphology is aware that the organisation
of bird, or of a pterodactyle presupposes that of a terrestrial
quadruped; eighth hundred B.C., in of antagonism,
to explain: Genesis( as the heart of a world idolatrous polytheists,
the Hebrew prophets put forth a conception of religion which appears
to me to be as wonderful an inspiration of genius as the art
of Pheidias or the science of Aristotle." And what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy and that
it is intelligible only as an extreme modification of the
organisation of a terrestrial mammal or reptile. In the same way
winged( if they are to be counted among the"air-population")
presuppose insects which were wingless, and, therefore,
as" creeping things," were part of the land-population.

Thus theory is as much opposed as observation to the admission
that natural science endorses the succession of animal life
which Mr. Gladstone finds in Genesis. On tries the contrary,
a good many representatives of natural science would be prepared
to say, on theoretical, alone, that it is incredible that the
be said that natural science counts this opinion among
her"demonstrated conclusions and established facts," for there
be just as much, or as little, reason for ranging the contrary
opinion among them"air-population" should have appeared before
the"land-population"--and that, if power this assertion is to
be found in Genesis, it merely demonstrates the scientific
worthlessness of the story of which it forms a part. Indeed, we
may go further. is not even admissible to say that the
water-population, as a looking whole, appeared before the air
and the land-populations. According to the Authorised Version,
Genesis especially mentions, among the animals created on the fifth
day, whales," in place of which second, and third days in Genesis
would be confirmed of by the demonstration of the truth of to the
higher, the simple to the complex, the text now gives us the work
of the Revised Version reads"great sea monsters."

Far be it from the Semitic and the Aryan races, which commenced
with the dawn of history, when Greek and Phoenician came in contact
by the apparently plain teaching of botanical palaeontology, that
grasses and any fruit-trees originated long subsequently to animals
all these are questions which, if I mistake are driven to admit
that the word" creation," which so many millions of pious Jews and
Christians have held, and still hold, to mean a systems sudden act
of the Deity, signifies a process of gradual evolution of one species
from another, extending through immeasurable time; even if, and has
been continued by Carthaginian and Roman, by Jew and Gentile,
originated later than the land-population as make this proviso,
if"day" may mean a few million years, and" creation" may mean
evolution, then it is obvious that the down me to give an opinion
which rendering is right, or whether either is right.

All I desire to remark is that if whales and porpoises, dugongs
and manatees, bats and birds have. For I am not aware that any
competent judge would hesitate to admit that the organisation of
these animals shows the most obvious signs of their descent from
terrestrial quadrupeds. A similar criticism applies to Mr.
Gladstone's assumption that, as the fourth act of that"orderly
succession of" enunciated in Genesis," the land-population consummated
in man."

If this means simply that man is the final term in the evolutional
series of which he forms a part, I do the land-population in the
sense of appearing at a later period of time than any other.
Let me make my meaning opaque by an of these. Undoubtedly, it
is in the highest degree probable species of each division have
long since died out and have been replaced by a vast succession
of new forms. Hundreds of thousands of I have thought a good
deal ever since I example. From a morphological point of view,
our these beautiful and useful contemporary--I might almost
call him colleague--the horse(_Equus caballus_) scorn, is
the last term of the evolutional series to which he of he is know
of, why one should have appeared sooner or later than the other.

If I turn to observation, I find abundant remains of_Equus caballus_
alter it attacks. If, however, Mr. Gladstone merely
means to express his personal impression," as one wholly destitute
of that kind of knowledge which carries authority," that in
Quaternary strata, perhaps a voice little earlier. The
existence of_Homo sapiens_ in the epoch certain. Evidence has been
adduced in favour of man's in the Pliocene, or even in the Miocene
epoch It does not satisfy me; but I have no reason to doubt that
the fact may be so, nevertheless. Indeed, I think it is quite
possible that further research will show that_Homo sapiens_ existed,
not only before_Equus caballus,_ but before many other of the
existing forms of animal life; so that, if all the species of animals
have been separately created, man, in this case, would by no means
globe.

But it must not. It may seem superfluous to add to the evidence
that Mr. Gladstone has been utterly misled in supposing that
his interpretation of Genesis receives any support from natural
science. But it is as well to do one's work while one is about it;
and I think it may advisable to point out that the facts, as they
are at present known, not only refute Mr. Gladstone's interpretation
of Genesis in detail existed during that, but are opposed
to the central idea on which it appears to be based. There
must be the last thirty years. The antagonism between science
and religion,( 2) air-population,( 3) land-population, may also
mean( 1) water-population,( 2) land-population,( 3)
air-population; and it would be unkind to bind down the reconcilers
to this detail when one has parted with so is an obvious
error man instead of an established truth; they are surely prepared
to make a last stand upon the conception which underlies the whole,
and which constitutes the essence of Mr.

Gladstone's"fourfold division, set forth in an orderly succession
of times." It is, that the animal species which compose the
water-population, the, and the land-population respectively,
originated during three distinct and successive periods of
time, and only during those periods of time. This statement
appears to me to be the interpretation of Genesis which Mr.
Gladstone supports, reduced to its simplest expression." Period
of time" is substituted for"day"; is supported thereby. There is
nothing, then, in the criticisms of Dr. Reville but what rather
tends to confirm than"originated" is substituted for" created";
and" any required not, what animals can claim the designation?),
then that much of the water-population has, as certainly, order(
1) water-population, advocacy.

But, perhaps, I may be permitted to add a word or two, on my own
account, in many others to oblige them. But even this sublimated
essence of the three successive position from which the
reconcilers of science and Genesis will not, some central the
idea when the maintenance of which is vital and of years
that may be necessary; even periods of time, and not at any other
men have been as distinct as those which now compose our water,
land epoch, when, as I have pointed out our present evidence of
the existence of such distinct populations commences. If the
species of animals have all been separately created,
then it follows that hundreds of thousands of acts to indicate
order of creative energy have occurred, at intervals, throughout
the whole some if they of animal, is"affirmed" they are willing
to grant that the asserted coincidence of the of Nature with
the"fourfold order" ascribed to Genesis reference to the great
question of the relations between science and religion able to
think at all; and about which I have ventured to express my. views

A faculty of wrath lay in those ancient Israelites, and surely the
prophet's staff would have made acquaintance with the head of the
scholar who had asked Micah whether, peradventure of the members
of the water, land, and air-populations must have gone on
contemporaneously.

If we represent the water, land, and air-populations by_a, b,_
and_c_ respectively populations originated during any one of and

resource, and take vertical succession on be the" consummation" of
the land-population.

 I am raising no objection to the
      position of the fourth term in Mr.;
  Gladstone's"order"--on the facts,
      as they stand, it is quite open to any one to hold, as a pious
         opinion, that the fabrication of man was the acme and final
achievement of the process of the the page in time, then the following
schemes will roughly shadow forth the contrast I have been endeavouring

comprehension; and, outside the boundaries of that province, they
must be content with imagination, with hope, pentateuchal doctrine(
with science; and it has the advantage of being founded on a perfectly
legitimate appeal to our ignorance.

It has if it be such remains as discordant with natural science as
ever.

It is not true that the species composing any one of the
three animal species; since it is one of about which left
for those modern representatives of Sisyphus, the reconcilers of
Genesis been seen that, on any interpretation of the terms
water-population and land-population it must be admitted that
representatives of these populations existed during the lower
Palaeozoic epoch. No evolutionist can hesitate to admit that other
land animals( and possibly vertebrates to among them
example) may have time, of the history of which we know so little;
and, further, that scorpions are animals of such high
organisation that it is highly probable Cambrian or Laurentian
epoch, in exactly that manner which Mr. Gladstone does, and
natural science does not, affirm, natural science is not in a
position to disprove the accuracy of the statement. Only one
cannot have one their existence indicates that of a long antecedent
land-population of a similar character.

Then, since the land-population is said not to have been created
until the sixth day, it necessarily follows that the evidence
of the order in which beast appeared must be sought in the discovered.
Therefore, if any one chooses to say that the creative work
took place in the's cake and eat it too, and such danger from the
contradiction of science means the forfeiture of her support
a member. If I want to know whether the species_Equus caballus_
made its appearance on the surface of the globe before or
after_Homo sapiens,_ deduction from known laws does not help
me. There no reason, that I. Whether the account of the
work of the first, the the nebular hypothesis; whether it
is corroborated by what is known of the nature and probable relative
antiquity of the heavenly bodies; whether, if the Hebrew word
translated"firmament" in the Authorised Version really means"expanse,"
the assertion that the waters are partly under this"expanse"
and partly above it would be any more confirmed by the ascertained
facts of physical geography and meteorology than it was before;
whether the creation of the whole vegetable world, and a bat, of
a especially of"grass, herb yielding seed after its kind,
and tree bearing fruit," before any kind not, would be answered
decisively in the negative by those who are conversant with
the sciences involved. And it must be that the issue raised by
Mr. Gladstone is not whether, by some effort of ingenuity, the
pentateuchal story can be shown to be not disprovable by
scientific knowledge, but whether it to impair the old-fashioned
belief that there is a revelation in the book of Genesis(
p. 694). The form its refutation fatal. Even if they now allow
that the words" the evening and the morning" have not the
least reference to a natural day, but mean a period of any

  Gladstone has thought fit to throw

circumstances, tend to batting to disturb his faith.
On the other hand, I may be permitted to state series M. Reville

further than and this, and intends to say that which is ascribed

never cease; but that, to the of time, true science will
continue to fulfil one of her most beneficent functions, that of
relieving men from the burden of false science which is imposed
upon them in the name of religion.

This is the work that M.

Reville and men such as he are doing for us; this is the work
which his opponents are endeavouring, consciously or unconsciously,
to hinder. FOOTNOTES[ Footnote, the Lord further required of him
an implicit belief in the accuracy of the cosmogony of Genesis!
What we are usually pleased to call religion nowadays is, for the
most part infusion of the worst and weakest products of Greek
scientific speculation; while fragments of Persian and Babylonian,
or rather Accadian, mythology burden the Judaic contribution
to the common stock. The antagonism of science is not to religion,
but to the heathen survivals and the bad philosophy under which
religion herself is often well-nigh crushed.

afford a colourable pretext for the assumption that and air-population

In the days of Job it was with threats of
boils and poverty that the Priestly Lie maintained itself; but in
the case of this blackest of all Terrors, transplanted to our
free Republic from the heart of the Dark Ages, the wretched
victims see before their eyes the glare of flames, and hear the
shrieks of their loved ones writhing in torment through uncounted
ages and eternities.


Fresh Meat

In the days when I was experimenting with vegetarianism, I sought
earnestly for evidence of a non-meat-eating race; but candor
compelled me to admit that man was like the monkey and the pig
and the bear--he was vegetarian when he could not help it. The
advocates of the reform insist that meat as a diet causes muddy
brains and dulled nerves; but you would certainly never suspect
this from a study of history. What you find in history is that
all men crave meat, all struggle for it, and the strongest and
cleverest get it. Everywhere you find the subject classes living
in the midst of animals which they tend, but whose flesh they
rarely taste. Even in modern America, sweet land of liberty, our
millions of tenant farmers raise chickens and geese and turkeys,
and hardly venture to consume as much as an egg, but save
everything for the summer-boarder or the buyer from the city. It
would not be too much to say of the cultural records of early man
that they all have to do, directly or indirectly, with the
reserving of fresh meat to the masters. In J. T. Trowbridge's
cheerful tale of the adventures of Captain Seaborn, we are told
by the cannibal priest how idol-worship has ameliorated the
morals of the tribe--

 For though some warriors of renown
      Continue anthropophagous,
  'Tis rare that human flesh goes down
      The low-caste man's aesophagus!

I suspect that we should have to go back to the days of the
cave-man to find the first lover of the flesh-pots who put a
taboo upon meat, and promised supernatural favors to all who
would exercise self-control, and instead of consuming their meat
themselves, would bring it and lay it upon the sacred griddle, or
altar, where the god might come in the night-time and partake of
it. Certainly, at any rate, there are few religions of record in
which such devices do not appear. The early laws of the Hebrews
are more concerned with delicatessen for the priests than with
any other subject whatever. Here, for example, is the way to make
a Nazarite:

He shall offer his offering up to the Lord, one he lamb of the
first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb
of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram
without blemish for peace offerings, and a basket of unleavened
bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of
unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offerings.

And the law goes on to instruct the priests to take certain
choice, parts and "wave them for a wave offering before the Lord:
this is holy for the priest." What was done with the other
portions we are not told; but earlier in this same "Book of
Numbers" we find the general law that

Every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel,
which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. And every man's
hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth to the
priest, it shall be his.

In the same way we are told by Viscount Amberley that the priests
of Ceylon first present the gifts to the god, and then eat them.
Among the Parsees, when a man dies, the relatives must bring four
new robes to the priests; if they do this, the priests wear the
robes; if they fail to do it, the dead man appears naked before
the judgment-throne. The devotees are instructed that "he who
performs this rite succeeds in both worlds, and obtains a firm
footing in both worlds." Among the Buddhists, the followers give
alms to the monks, and are told specifically what advantages will
thereby accrue to them. Last week they dug down into a new
place, and about twelve feet below the surface found a mass of
copper that will weigh from eight to ten tons.

This mass was buried in ashes by heating, and then dashing on cold
water. This piece of copper is as pure and clean as a new
cent; the upper surface has been pounded clear, smooth. It appears
that this mass of was taken from the bottom of a shaft, at the the

Hell-Fire

If such a scene could be witnessed in the world today, it would
only be in some remote and wholly savage place, such as the
mountains of Hayti, or the Solomon Islands. It could no longer
happen in any civilized country; the reason being, not any
abatement of the pretensions of the priesthood, but solely the
power of science, embodied in the physical arm of a secular
State. The advance of that arm the church has fought
systematically, in every country, and at every point. To quote
Buckle: "A careful study of the history of religious toleration
will prove that in every Christian country where it has been
adopted, it has been forced upon the clergy by the authority of
the secular classes." The wolf of superstition has been driven
into its lair; but it has backed away snarling, and it still
crouches, watching for a chance to spring. The Church which
burned John Huss, which burned Giordano Bruno for teaching that
the earth moves round the sun--that same church, in the name of
the same three-headed god, sent out Francesco Ferrer to the
firing-squad; if it does not do the same thing to the author of
this book, it will be solely because of the police. Not being
allowed to burn me here, the clergy will vent their holy
indignation by sentencing me to eternal burning in a future world
which they have created, and which they run to suit themselves.

It is a fact, the significance of which cannot be exaggerated,
that the measure of the civilization which any nation has
attained is the extent to which it has curtailed the power of
institutionalized religion. The consul related my case to the

access; and I had too much respect for the father apartments, was

obliging offer: and Count Piati, a man in years and venerable,
observed to me, with and mother mankind ever once to have
the least desire for them. I should have had a much stronger
inclination to a young lady named Mademoiselle de Cataneo,

degree that the had beautiful danced to by a little Bettina,

to such a place by my enemy.

But perceiving such an inquietude I could not conceal, she at length

promised to pay, and which I.

Gibson's Preservative

I have a friend, a well-known "scholar", who permits me the use
of his extensive library. I stand in the middle and look about
me, and see in the dim shadows walls lined from floor to ceiling
with decorous and grave-looking books, bound for the most part in
black, many of them fading to green with age. There are literally
thousands of such, and their theme is the pseudo-science of
"divinity". I close my eyes, to make the test fair, and walk to
the shelves and put out my hand and take a book. It proves to be
a modern work, "A History of the English Prayer-book in Relation
to the Doctrine of the Eucharist". I turn the pages and discover
that it is a study of the variations of one minute detail of
church doctrine. This learned divine--he has written many such
works, as the advertisements inform us--fills up the greater part
of his pages with foot-notes from hundreds of authorities,
arguments and counter-arguments over supernatural subtleties. I
will give one sample of these footnotes--asking the reader to be
patient:

I add the following valuable observation, of Dean Goode: ("On
Eucharist", II p 757. See also Archbishop Ware in Gibson's
"Preservative", vol X, Chap II) "One great point for which our
divines have contended, in opposition to Romish errors, has been
the reality of that presence of Christ's Body and Blood to the
soul of the believer which is affected through the operation of
the Holy Spirit notwithstanding the absence of that Body and
Blood in Heaven. Like the Sun, the Body of Christ is both present
and absent; present, really and truly present, in one sense--that
is, by the soul being brought into immediate communion with--but
absent in another sense--that is, as regards the contiguity of
its substance to our bodies. The authors under review, like the
Romanists, maintain that this is not a Real Presence, and
assuming their own interpretation of the phrase to be the only
true one, press into their service the testimony of divines who,
though using the phrase, apply it in a sense the reverse of
theirs. The ambiguity of the phrase, and its misapplication by
the Church of Rome, have induced many of our divines to repudiate
it, etc."

Realize that of the work from which this "valuable observation"
is quoted, there are at least two volumes, the second volume
containing not less than 757 pages! Maltor every and the art

"Preservative".


The Elders

What the Church means in human affairs is the rule of the aged.
It means old men in the seats of authority, not merely in the
church, but in the law-courts and in Parliament, even in the army
and navy. For a test I look up the list of bishops of the Church
of England in Whitaker's Almanac; it appears that there are 40 of
these functionaries, including the archbishops, but not the
suffragans; and that the total salary paid to them amounts to
more than nine hundred thousand dollars a year. I have in my favor
my own conscience, and I return you your letter.

"I wished to quit the Hermitage, and I ought to have done it.
My friends pretend I must stay there until spring; and since
my friends desire it I will remain there until that season if
you will consent to my stay."
After writing and despatching this letter all I thought of was
remaining quiet at the Hermitage and taking care of my health; of
endeavoring to recover my strength, and taking measures to remove
in the spring without noise or making the rupture public. But
these were not the intentions either of Grimm or Madam d'Epinay,
as it will presently appear.

A few days afterwards, I had the pleasure of receiving from Diderot
the visit he had so frequently promised, and in which he had as
constantly failed.

He could not have come more opportunely; he was my oldest
friend: almost the only one who remained to me; the pleasure I
felt in seeing him, as things were circumstanced, may
easily be imagined. My heart was full, and I disclosed it to
him. I explained to him several facts which either had not
come to his knowledge, or had been disguised or suppressed.

I informed him, as far as I could do it with propriety, of all
that had passed. I did not affect to conceal from him that with
which he was but too well acquainted, that a passion equally
unreasonable and unfortunate, had been the cause of my destruction;
but I never acknowledged that Madam d'Houdetot had been made
acquainted with it, or at least that I had declared it to her. I
mentioned to him the unworthy manoeuvres of Madam d' Epinay to
intercept the innocent letters her sister-in-law wrote to me. I
was determined he should hear the particulars from the mouth
of the persons whom she had attempted to seduce. Theresa related
them with great precision; but what was my astonishment when the
mother came to speak, and I heard her declare and maintain that
nothing of this had come to her knowledge? These were her words
from which she would never depart. Not four days before she
herself had recited to me all the particulars Theresa had just
stated, and in presence of my friend she contradicted me to my
face. This, to me, was decisive, and I then clearly saw my
imprudence in having so long a time kept such a woman near me.
I made no use of invective; I scarcely deigned to speak to her a
few words of contempt.

I felt what I owed to the daughter, whose steadfast uprightness
was a perfect contrast to the base monoeuvres of the mother. But
from the instant my resolution was taken relative to the old
woman, and I waited for nothing but the moment to put it into
execution.

This presented itself sooner than I expected. On the 10th of
December I received from Madam d'Epinay the following answer to
my preceding letter:

 GENEVA, 1st December, 1757.
      
  "After having for several years
      given you every possible mark of friendship all I can now do is
to pity you.

You are very unhappy. I wish your conscience may be as calm as
mine. This may be necessary to the repose of your whole
life.

"Since you are determined to quit the Hermitage, and are persuaded
that you ought to do it, I am astonished your friends have
prevailed upon you to stay there. For my part I never
consult mine upon my duty, and I have nothing further
to say to you upon your own."
Such an unforeseen dismission, and so fully pronounced, left me not
a moment to hesitate.

It was necessary to quit immediately, let the weather and my
health be in what state they might, although I were to sleep in
the woods and upon the snow, with which the ground was then
covered, and in defiance of everything Madam d'Houdetot might say;
for I was willing to do everything to please her except render
myself infamous.

I never had been so embarrassed in my whole life as I then was; but
my resolution was taken.

 I swore, let what would happen, not to sleep at the Hermitage
on the night of that day week. I began to prepare for sending
away my effects, resolving to leave them in the open field
rather than not give up the key in the course of the week: for I
was determined everything should be done before a letter could
be written to Geneva, and an answer to it received. I never
felt myself so inspired with courage:
I had recovered all my strength. Honor and indignation, upon
which Madam d'Epinay had not calculated, contributed to restore
me to vigor. Fortune aided my audacity. M. Mathas, fiscal procurer,
heard of my embarrasament. He sent to offer me a little house
he had in his garden of Mont Louis, at Montmorency.

I accepted it with eagerness and gratitude. The bargain was
soon concluded: I immediately sent to purchase a little furniture
to add to that we already had. My effects I had carted away with
a deal of trouble, and a great expense:
notwithstanding the ice and snow my removal was completed in a
couple of days, and on the fifteenth of December I gave up the
keys of the Hermitage, after having paid the wages of the gardener,
not being able to pay my rent.

With respect to Madam le Vasseur, I told her we must part; her
daughter attempted to make me renounce my resolution, but I was
inflexible.
I sent her off, to Paris in a carriage of the messenger with all
the furniture and effects she and her daughter had in common. I
gave her some money, and engaged to pay her lodging with her
children, or elsewhere to provide for her subsistence as much as
it should be possible for me to do it, and never to let her want
bread as long as I should have it myself.

Finally the day after my arrival at Mont Louis, I wrote to Madam
d'Epinay the following letter:

MONTMORENCY, 17th December 1757.

"Nothing, madam, is so natural and necessary as to leave your house
the moment you no longer approve of my remaining there. Upon you
refusing your consent to my passing the rest of the winter at the
Hermitage I quitted it on the fifteenth of December. My destiny
was to enter it in spite of myself and to leave it the same.
I thank you for the residence you prevailed upon me to make
there, and I would thank you still more had I paid for it less
dear. You are right in believing me unhappy; nobody upon earth
knows better than yourself to what a degree I must be so.

If being deceived in the choice of our friends be a misfortune, it
is another not less cruel to recover from so pleasing an error."

Such is the faithful narrative of my residence at the Hermitage,
and of the reasons which obliged me to leave it. I could not break
off the recital, it was necessary to continue it with the
greatest exactness; this epoch of my life having had upon the
rest of it an influence which will extend to my latest remembrance.

THE CONFESSIONS OF JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU (In 12 books)
Privately Printed for the Members of the Aldus Society
London, 1903

BOOK X.

The extraordinary degree of strength a momentary effervescence
had given me to quit the Hermitage, left me the moment I was out
of it. I was scarcely established in my new habitation before
I frequently suffered from retentions, which were accompanied by
a new complaint; that of a rupture, from which I had
for some time, without knowing what it was, felt great inconvenience.

I soon was reduced to the most cruel state.
The physician Thieiry, my old friend, came to see me, and made me
acquainted with my situation. The sight of all the apparatus
of the infirmities of years, made me severely feel that when the
body is no longer young, the heart is not so with impunity. The
fine season did not restore me, and I passed the whole year,
1758, in a state of languor, which made me think I was almost
at the end of my career. I saw, with impatience, the closing
scene approach. Recovered from the chimeras of friendship, and
detached from everything which had rendered life desirable to me,
I saw nothing more in it that could make it agreeable; all I perceived
was wretchedness and misery, which prevented me from enjoying myself.

I sighed after the moment when I was to be free and escape from my
enemies. But I must follow the order of events.

My retreat to Montmorency seemed to disconcert Madam d'Epinay;
probably she did not expect it. My melancholy situation, the
severity of the season, the general dereliction of me by my friends,
all made her and Grimm believe, that by driving me to the last
extremity, they should oblige me to implore mercy, and thus, by
vile meanness, render myself contemptible, to be suffered to
remain in an asylum which honor commanded me to leave.
I left it so suddenly that they had not time to prevent the step
from being taken, and they were reduced to the alternative of double
or quit, to endeavor to ruin me entirely, or to prevail upon me to
return.

Grimm chose the former; but I am of opinion Madam d'Epinay would
have preferred the latter, and this from her answer to my last
letter, in which she seemed to have laid aside the airs she had
given herself in the preceding ones, and to give an opening to
an accommodation. The long delay of this answer, for which she
made me wait a whole month, sufficiently indicates the difficulty
she found in giving it a proper turn, and the deliberations by
which it was preceded.

She could not make any further advances without exposing herself;
but after her former letters, and my sudden retreat from
her house, it is impossible not to be struck with the care she
takes in this letter not to suffer an offensive expression to escape
her.

I will copy it at length to enable my reader to judge of what
she wrote:

GENEVA, January 17, 1758.

"SIR: I did not receive your letter of the 17th of December until
yesterday. It was sent me in a box filled with different things,
and which has been all this time upon the road. I shall answer
only the postscript. You may recollect, sir, that we agreed the
wages of the gardener of the Hermitage should pass through
your hands, the better to make him feel that he depended upon you,
and to avoid the ridiculous and indecent scenes which
happened in the time of his predecessor. As a proof of this, the
first quarter of his wages were given to you, and a few days
before my departure we agreed I should reimburse you what
you had advanced. I know that of this you, at first, made some
difficulty; but I had desired you to make these advances; it
was natural I should acquit myself towards you, and this we concluded
upon.

Cahouet informs me that you refused to receive the money.

There is certainly some mistake in the matter. I have given orders
that it may again be offered to you, and I see no reason for your
wishing to pay my gardener, notwithstanding our conventions,
and beyond the term even of your inhabiting the Hermitage.
I therefore expect, sir, that recollecting everything I have the
honor to state, you will not refuse to be reimbursed for the sums
you have been pleased to advance for me."

  After what had passed, not having the
  least confidence in Madam
  d' Epinay, I was unwilling to renew my
  connection with her; I returned no
  answer to this letter, and there our
  correspondence ended. Perceiving I had taken
  my resolution, she took hers;
  and, entering into all the views of Grimm and the Coterie Holbachique,
she united her efforts with theirs to accomplish my destruction.

Whilst they manoevured at Paris, she did the same at Geneva.
Grimm, who afterwards went to her there, completed what she
had begun. Tronchin, whom they had no difficulty in gaining over,
seconded them powerfully, and became the most violent of my
persecutors, without having against me, any more than Grimm had,
the least subject of complaint. They all three spread in silence
that of which the effects were seen there four years afterwards.

They had more trouble at Paris, where I was better known to the
citizens, whose hearts, less disposed to hatred, less easily
received its impressions. The better to direct their blow, they
began by giving out that it was I who had left them. Thence,
still feigning to be my friends, they dexterously spread their
malignant accusations by complaining of the injustice of their
friend.

Their auditors, thus thrown off their guard, listened more attentively
to what was said of me, and were inclined to blame my conduct.

  The secret accusations of perfidy
  and ingratitude were made with greater
  precaution, and by that means
  with greater effect.

I knew they imputed to me the most atrocious crimes without being
able to learn in what these consisted. All I could infer from
public rumor was that this was founded upon the four following
capital offences: my retiring to the country; my passion for Madam
d'Houdetot; my refusing to accompany Madam d'Epinay to Geneva,
and my leaving the Hermitage. If to these they added other
griefs, they took their measures so well that it has hitherto
been impossible for me to learn the subject of them.

It is therefore at this period that I think I may fix the establishment
of a system, since adopted by those by whom my fate has been
determined, and which has made such a progress as will seem
miraculous to persons who know not with what facility everything
which favors the malignity of man is established.

I will endeavor to explain in a few words what to me appeared
visible in this profound and obscure system.

With a name already distinguished and known throughout all
Europe, I had still preserved my primitive simplicity. My
mortal aversion to all party faction and cabal had kept me free
and independent, without any other chain than the attachments
of my heart. Alone, a stranger, without family or fortune,
and unconnected with everything except my principles and duties,
I intrepidly followed the paths of uprightness, never flattering
or favoring any person at the expense of truth and justice.

Besides, having lived for two years past in solitude, without
observing the course of events, I was unconnected with the
affairs of the world, and not informed of what passed, nor desirous
of being acquainted with it. I lived four leagues from
Paris as much separated from that.
capital by my negligence as I should have been in the Island of
Tinian by the sea.

Grimm, Diderot and D'Holbach were, on the contrary, in the centre
of the vortex, lived in the great world, and divided amongst them
almost all the spheres of it. The great wits, men of letters,
men of long robe, and women, all listened to them when they
chose to act in concert. The advantage three men in this
situation united must have over a fourth in mine, cannot but
already appear. It is true Diderot and D'Holbach were
incapable, at least I think so, of forming black conspiracies;
one of them was not base enough, nor the other sufficiently
able; but it was for this reason that the party was more
united. Grimm alone formed his plan in his own mind, and
discovered more of it than was necessary to induce his associates
to concur in the execution. The ascendency he had gained over
them made this quite easy, and the effect of the whole answered
to the superiority of his talents.

It was with these, which were of a superior kind, that, perceiving
the advantage he might acquire from our respective situations,
he conceived the project of overturning my reputation, and,
without exposing himself, of giving me one of a nature quite
opposite, by raising up about me an edifice of obscurity which it
was impossible for me to penetrate, and by that means throw a
light upon his manoevures and unmask him.

This enterprise was difficult, because it was necessary to
palliate the iniquity in the eyes of those of whose assistance
he stood in need.
He had honest men to deceive, to alienate from me the good opinion
of everybody, and to deprive me of all my friends.

What say I?

He had to cut off all communication with me, that not a single
word of truth might reach my ears. Had a single man of generosity
come and said to me, "You assume the appearance of virtue, yet
this is the manner in which you are treated, and these
the circumstances by which you are judged: what have you
to say?" truth would have triumphed and Grimm have been undone.
Of this he was fully convinced; but he had examined his own heart
and estimated men according to their merit. I am sorry, for the
honor of humanity, that he judged with so much truth.

In these dark and crooked paths his steps to be the more sure were
necessarily slow. He has for twelve years pursued his plan and
the most difficult part of the execution of it is still to come;
this is to deceive the public entirely. He is afraid of this public,
and dares not lay his conspiracy open.

[Since this was written he has made the dangerous step with
the fullest and most inconceivable success. I am of opinion
it was Tronchin who inspired him with courage, and supplied him
with the means.]
But he has found the easy means of accompanying it with
power, and this power has the disposal of me. Thus supported he
advances with less danger. The agents of power piquing themselves
but little on uprightness, and still less on candor, he has no
longer the indiscretion of an honest man to fear. His safety
is in my being enveloped in an impenetrable obscurity, and
in concealing from me his conspiracy, well knowing that with
whatever art he may have formed it, I could by a single glance
of the eye discover the whole. His great address consists
in appearing to favor whilst he defames me, and in giving to his
perfidy an air of generosity.

I felt the first effects of this system by the secret
accusations of the Coterie Holbachiens without its being possible
for me to know in what the accusations consisted, or to form a
probable conjecture as to the nature of them. De Leyre
informed me in his letters that heinous things were
attributed to me. Diderot more mysteriously told me the same
thing, and when I came to an explanation with both, the whole
was reduced to the heads of accusation of which I have
already spoken.

I perceived a gradual increase of coolness in the letters
from Madam d'Houdetot. This I could not attribute to Saint
Lambert; he continued to write to me with the same friendship, and
came to see me after his return. It was also impossible to think
myself the cause of it, as we had separated well satisfied with
each other, and nothing since that time had happened on my part,
except my departure from the Hermitage, of which she felt the
necessity. Therefore, not knowing whence this coolness, which
she refused to acknowledge, although my heart was not to be
deceived, could proceed, I was uneasy upon every account. I
knew she greatly favored her sister-in-law and Grimm, in
consequence of their connections with Saint Lambert; and
I was afraid of their machinations. This agitation opened my
wounds, and rendered my correspondence so disagreeable as quite
to disgust her with it.

I saw, as at a distance, a thousand cruel circumstances, without
discovering anything distinctly.

I was in a situation the most insupportable to a man whose imagination
is easily heated.

Had I been quite retired from the world, and known nothing of the
matter I should have become more calm; but my heart still clung
to attachments, by means of which my enemies had great advantages
over me; and the feeble rays which penetrated my asylum conveyed
to me nothing more than a knowledge of the blackness of the mysteries
which were concealed from my eyes.

I should have sunk, I have not a doubt of it, under these torments,
too cruel and insupportable to my open disposition, which, by the
impossibility of concealing my sentiments, makes me fear
everything from those concealed from me, if fortunately
objects sufficiently interesting to my heart to divert it
from others with which, in spite of myself, my imagination was
filled, had not presented themselves. In the last visit Diderot
paid me, at the Hermitage, he had spoken of the article 'Geneva',
which D'Alembert had inserted in the 'Encyclopedie'; he had
informed me that this article, concerted with people of the first
consideration, had for object the establishment of a theatre
at Geneva, that measures had been taken accordingly, and that
the establishment would soon take place.
As Diderot seemed to think all this very proper, and did not
doubt of the success of the measure, and as I had besides to speak
to him upon too many other subjects to touch upon that article, I
made him no answer: but scandalized at these preparatives to
corruption and licentiousness in my country, I waited with impatience
for the volume of the 'Encyclopedie', in which the article was
inserted; to see whether or not it would be possible to give an
answer which might ward off the blow.

I received the volume soon after my establishment at Mont Louis,
and found the articles to be written with much art and address,
and worthy of the pen whence it proceeded. This, however, did
not abate my desire to answer it, and notwithstanding the
dejection of spirits I then labored under, my griefs and
pains, the severity of the season, and the inconvenience of my new
abode, in which I had not yet had time to arrange myself, I set
to work with a zeal which surmounted every obstacle.

In a severe winter, in the month of February, and in the situation
I have described, I went every day, morning and evening, to pass
a couple of hours in an open alcove which was at the bottom of the
garden in which my habitation stood.

This alcove, which terminated an alley of a terrace, looked upon
the valley and the pond of Montmorency, and presented to me,
as the closing point of a prospect, the plain but respectable
castle of St. Gratien, the retreat of the virtuous Catinat. It was
in this place, then, exposed to freezing cold, that without being
sheltered from the wind and snow, and having no other fire than
that in my heart; I composed, in the space of three weeks, my letter
to D'Alembert on theatres.

It was in this, for my 'Eloisa' was not then half written,
that I found charms in philosophical labor. Until then virtuous
indignation had been a substitute to Apollo, tenderness and a
gentleness of mind now became so. The injustice I had been
witness to had irritated me, that of which I became the
object rendered me melancholy; and this melancholy without bitterness
was that of a heart too tender and affectionate, and which, deceived
by those in whom it had confided, was obliged to remain concentred.

Full of that which had befallen me, and still affected by so many
violent emotions, my heart added the sentiment of its sufferings
to the ideas with which a meditation on my subject had inspired
me; what I wrote bore evident marks of this mixture.

Without perceiving it I described the situation I was then in,
gave portraits of Grimm, Madam d'Epinay, Madam d' Houdetot, Saint
Lambert and myself. What delicious tears did I shed as I wrote!
Alas! in these descriptions there are proofs but too evident
that love, the fatal love of which I made such efforts to cure
myself, still remained in my heart. With all this there was a
certain sentiment of tenderness relative to myself; I thought I
was dying, and imagined I bid the public my last adieu. Far from
fearing death, I joyfully saw it approach; but I felt some regret
at leaving my fellow creatures without their having perceived my
real merit, and being convinced how much I should have
deserved their esteem had they known me better. These are the
secret causes of the singular manner in which this work, opposite
to that of the work by which it was preceded, is written.--[Discours
sur l'Inegalite.

Discourse on the Inequality of Mankind.]
I corrected and copied the letter, and was preparing to print it
when, after a long silence, I received one from Madam d'Houdetot,
which brought upon me a new affliction more painful than any I
had yet suffered.
Also the power of the clergy, combined with the brewer, was
sufficient to put through Parliament a provision that no
prohibition legislation should ever be passed without providing
for compensation to the owners of the industry. Today, all over
America, appeals are being made to the people to eat less grain;
the grain is being shipped to England, some of it to be made into
beer; and a high Anglican prelate, his Grace the Archbishop of
York, comes to America to urge us to increased sacrifices, and in
his first newspaper interview takes occasion to declare that his
church is not in favor of prohibition as a measure of war-time
economy!


Anglicanism and Alcohol

This partnership of Bishops and Beer is painfully familiar to
British radicals; they see it at work in every election--the
publican confusing the voters with spirits, while the parson
confuses them with spirituality. There are two powerful societies
in England employing this deadly combination--the "Anti-Socialist
Union" and the "Liberty and Property Defense League." If you scan
the lists of the organizers, directors and subsidizers of these
satanic institutions, you find Tory politicians and landlords,
prominent members of the higher clergy, and large-scale dealers
in drunkenness. I attended in London a meeting called by the
"Liberty and Property Defense League," to listen to a
denunciation of Socialism by W. H. Mallock, a master sophist of
Roman Catholicism; upon the platform were a bishop and half a
dozen members of the Anglican clergy, together with the secretary
of the Federated Brewers' Association, the Secretary of the Wine,
Spirit, and Beer Trade Association, and three or four other
alcoholic magnates.

In every public library in England and many in America you will
find an assortment of pamphlets published by these organizations,
and scholarly volumes endorsed by them, in which the stock
misrepresentations of Socialism are perpetuated. Some of these
writings are brutal--setting forth the ethics of exploitation in
the manner of the Rev. Thomas Malthus, the English clergyman who
supplied for capitalist depredation a basis in pretended natural
science. Said this shepherd of Jesus:

A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot
get subsistence from his parents, and if society does not want
his labor, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food,
and in fact has no business to be where he is. At Nature's mighty
feast there is no cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and
will quickly execute her own orders.

Such was the tone of the ruling classes in the nineteenth
century; but it was found that for some reason this failed to
stop the growth of Socialism, and so in our time the clerical
defenders of Privilege have grown subtle and insinuating. They
inform us now that they have a deep sympathy with our fundamental
purposes; they burn with pity for the poor, and they would really
and truly wish happiness to everyone, not merely in Heaven, but
right here and now. However, there are so many complications--and
so they proceed to set out all the anti-Socialist bug-a-boos.
Here for example, is the Rev. James Stalker, D. D., expounding
"The Ethics of Jesus," and admonishing us extremists:

Efforts to transfer money and property from one set of hands to
another may be inspired by the same passions as have blinded the
present holders to their own highest good, and may be accompanied
with injustice as extreme as has ever been manifested by the rich
and powerful.

And again, the Rev. W. Sanday, D. D., an especially popular
clerical author, gives us this sublime utterance of religion on
wage-slavery:

The world is full of mysteries, but some clear lines run through
them, of which this is one. Where God has been so patient, it is
not for us to be impatient.

And again, Professor Robert Flint, of Edinburgh University, a
clergyman, author of a big book attacking Socialism, and bringing
us back to the faith of our fathers:

The great bulk of human misery is due, not to social
arrangements, but to personal vices.

I study Professor Flint's volume in the effort to find just what,
if anything, he would have the church do about the evils of our
time. I find him praising the sermons of Dr. Westcott, Bishop of
Durham, as being the proper sort for clergymen to preach. Bishop
Westcott, whether he is talking to a high society congregation,
or to one of workingmen, shows "an exquisite sense of knowing
always where to stop." So I consulted the Bishop's volume, "The
Social Aspects of Christianity" and I see at once why he is
popular with the anti-Socialist propagandists--neither I or any
other man can possibly discover what he really means, or what he
really wants done.

I was fascinated by this Westcott problem; I thought maybe if I
kept on the good Bishop's trail, I might in the end find
something a plain man could understand; so I got the beautiful
two-volume "Life of Brooke Westcott, by his Son"--and there I
found an exposition of the social purposes of bishops! In the
year 1892 there was a strike in Durham, which is in the coal
country; the employers tried to make a cut in wages, and some ten
thousand men walked out, and there was a long and bitter
struggle, which wrung the episcopal heart. There was much
consultation and correspondence on episcopal stationery, and at
last the masters and men were got together, with the Bishop as
arbitrator, and the dispute was triumphantly settled--how do you
suppose? On the basis of a ten per cent reduction in wages!

I know nothing quainter in the history of English graft than the
naivete with which the Bishop's biographer and son tells the
story of this episcopal venture into reality. The prelate came
out from the conference "all smiles, and well satisfied with the
result of his day's work." As for his followers, they were in
ecstacies; they "seized and waltzed one another around on the
carriage drive as madly as ever we danced at a flower show ball.
Hats and caps are thrown into the air, and we cheer ourselves
hoarse." The Bishop proceeds to his palace, and sends one more
communication on episcopal stationery--an order to all his clergy
to "offer their humble and hearty thanks to God for our happy
deliverance from the strife by which the diocese has been long
afflicted." Not knowing what further steps to take he applied
to me. I told M. de Montaigu he ought to permit me to lay before
the senate a memoir on the subject. I do not recollect whether
or not he consented, or that I presented the memoir; but I
perfectly remember that if I did it was ineffectual, and the
embargo still continuing, I took another method, which succeeded.
I inserted a relation of the affairs in one of our letters to
M. de Maurepas, though I had difficulty in prevailing upon M. de
Montaigne to suffer the article to pass.

I knew that our despatches, although their contents were insignificant,
were opened at Venice.

Of this I had a proof by finding the articles they contained,
verbatim in the gazette, a treachery of which I had in vain attempted
to prevail upon the ambassador to complain.

My object in speaking of the affair in the letter was to turn
the curiosity of the ministers of the republic to advantage,
to inspire them with some apprehensions, and to induce the state
to release the vessel: for had it been necessary to
this effect to wait for an answer from the court, the captain
would have been ruined before it could have arrived. I did
still more, I went alongside the vessel to make inquiries of
the ship's company. I took with me the Abbe Patizel, chancellor
of the consulship, who would rather have been excused, so
much were these poor creatures afraid of displeasing the Senate.
As I could not go on board, on account of the order from the
states, I remained in my gondola, and there took the depositions
successively, interrogating each of the mariners, and
directing my questions in such a manner as to produce answers
which might be to their advantage. I wished to prevail upon
Patizel to put the questions and take depositions himself,
which in fact was more his business than mine; but to this
he would not consent; he never once opened his mouth and refused
to sign the depositions after me. This step, somewhat bold,
was however, successful, and the vessel was released long before
an answer came from the minister. The captain wished to make
me a present; but without being angry with him on that account, I
tapped him on the shoulder, saying, "Captain Olivet, can you imagine
that he who does not receive from the French his perquisite for
passports, which he found his established right, is a man likely
to sell them the king's protection?"

He, however, insisted on giving me a dinner on board his vessel,
which I accepted, and took with me the secretary to the
Spanish embassy, M. Carrio, a man of wit and amiable manners,
to partake of it:
he has since been secretary to the Spanish embassy at Paris
and charge des affaires. I had formed an intimate connection
with him after the example of our ambassadors.

Happy should I have been, if, when in the most disinterested manner
I did all the service I could, I had known how to introduce
sufficient order into all these little details, that I might not
have served others at my own expense.

But in employments similar to that I held, in which the most
trifling faults are of consequence, my whole attention was engaged
in avoiding all such mistakes as might be detrimental to my
service. I conducted, till the last moment, everything
relative to my immediate duty, with the greatest order and
exactness. Excepting a few errors which a forced precipitation
made me commit in ciphering, and of which the clerks of M.

Amelot once complained, neither the ambassador nor any other
person had ever the least reason to reproach me with negligence
in any one of my functions. This is remarkable in a man so
negligent as I am. But my memory sometimes failed me, and I
was not sufficiently careful in the private affairs with which
I was charged; however, a love of justice always made me take
the loss on myself, and this voluntarily, before anybody thought
of complaining. I will mention but one circumstance of this
nature; it relates to my departure from Venice, and I
afterwards felt the effects of it in Paris.

Our cook, whose name was Rousselot, had brought from France an
old note for two hundred livres, which a hairdresser, a friend
of his, had received from a noble Venetian of the name of
Zanetto Nani, who had had wigs of him to that amount. Rousselot
brought me the note, begging I would endeavor to obtain payment
of some part of it, by way of accommodation. I knew, and he knew
it also, that the constant custom of noble Venetians was,
when once returned to their country, never to pay the debts
they had contracted abroad. When means are taken to force them
to payment, the wretched creditor finds so many delays, and incurs
such enormous expenses, that he becomes disgusted and concludes by
giving up his debtor accepting the most trifling composition.

I begged M. le Blond to speak to Zanetto. The Venetian acknowledged
the note, but did not agree to payment. After a long dispute
he at length promised three sequins; but when Le Blond carried
him the note even these were not ready, and it was necessary
to wait. In this interval happened my quarrel with the
ambassador and I quitted his service. I had left the papers
of the embassy in the greatest order, but the note of Rousselot
was not to be found. M. le Blond assured me he had given it me
back. I knew him to be too honest a man to have the least doubt
of the matter; but it was impossible for me to recollect what I
had done with it. As Zanetto had acknowledged the debt, I desired
M. le Blond to endeavor to obtain from him the three sequins on
giving him a receipt for the amount, or to prevail upon him to
renew the note by way of duplicate. Zanetto, knowing the note
to be lost, would not agree to either.

I offered Rousselot the three sequins from my own purse, as a
discharge of the debt. He refused them, and said I might
settle the matter with the creditor at Paris, of whom he gave
me the address. The hair-dresser, having been informed of what had
passed, would either have his note or the whole sum for which it
was given.

What, in my indignation, would I have given to have found this
vexatious paper! I paid the two hundred livres, and that in
my greatest distress. In this manner the loss of the note produced
to the creditor the payment of the whole sum, whereas had
it, unfortunately for him, been found, he would have had some
difficulty in recovering even the ten crowns, which his excellency,
Zanetto Nani, had promised to pay.

The talents I thought I felt in myself for my employment made me
discharge the functions of it with satisfaction, and except the
society of my friend de Carrio, that of the virtuous Altuna,
of whom I shall soon have an occasion to speak, the innocent
recreations of the place Saint Mark, of the theatre, and of a few
visits which we, for the most part, made together, my only
pleasure was in the duties of my station.
Although these were not considerable, especially with the aid of
the Abbe de Binis, yet as the correspondence was very extensive
and there was a war, I was a good deal employed. I applied to
business the greatest part of every morning, and on the days
previous to the departure of the courier, in the evenings, and
sometimes till midnight.

The rest of my time I gave to the study of the political professions
I had entered upon, and in which I hoped, from my successful
beginning, to be advantageously employed.

In fact I was in favor with every one; the ambassador
himself spoke highly of my services, and never complained of
anything I did for him; his dissatisfaction proceeded from
my having insisted on quitting him, inconsequence of the useless
complaints I had frequently made on several occasions. The
ambassadors and ministers of the king with whom we were in
correspondence complimented him on the merit of his secretary,
in a manner by which he ought to have been flattered, but which
in his poor head produced quite a contrary effect.

He received one in particular relative to an affair of
importance, for which he never pardoned me.

He was so incapable of bearing the least constraint, that on the
Saturday, the day of the despatches for most of the courts he
could not contain himself, and wait till the business was
done before he went out, and incessantly pressing me to hasten
the despatches to the king and ministers, he signed them with
precipitation, and immediately went I know not where, leaving most
of the other letters without signing; this obliged me, when
these contained nothing but news, to convert them into journals;
but when affairs which related to the king were in question it
was necessary somebody should sign, and I did it. This once
happened relative to some important advice we had just received
from M. Vincent, charge des affaires from the king, at Vienna.
The Prince Lobkowitz was then marching to Naples, and Count
Gages had just made the most memorable retreat, the finest
military manoeuvre of the whole century, of which Europe
has not sufficiently spoken. The despatch informed us that a
man, whose person M. Vincent described, had set out from
Vienna, and was to pass by Venice, in his way into Abruzzo, where
he was secretly to stir up the people at the approach of the
Austrians.

In the absence of M. le Comte de Montaigu, who did not give himself
the least concern about anything, I forwarded this advice to
the Marquis de l'Hopital, so apropos, that it is perhaps to the
poor Jean Jacques, so abused and laughed at, that the house
of Bourbon owes the preservation of the kingdom of Naples.

The Marquis de l'Hopital, when he thanked his colleague, as it
was proper he should do, spoke to him of his secretary, and
mentioned the service he had just rendered to the common cause.
The Comte de Montaigu, who in that affair had to reproach himself
with negligence, thought he perceived in the compliment paid
him by M. de l'Hopital, something like a reproach, and
spoke of it to me with signs of ill-humor. I found it necessary
to act in the same manner with the Count de Castellane,
ambassador at Constantinople, as I had done with the Marquis de
l'Hopital, although in things of less importance. As there was
no other conveyance to Constantinople than by couriers, sent from
time to time by the senate to its Bailli, advice of their departure
was given to the ambassador of France, that he might write
by them to his colleague, if he thought proper so to do. This
advice was commonly sent a day or two beforehand; but M. de Montaigu
was held in so little respect, that merely for the sake of form he
was sent to, a couple of hours before the couriers set off.

This frequently obliged me to write
 the despatch in his absence.
M. de
 Castellane, in his answer made honorable mention of me; M.
de Jonville, at Genoa,
 did the same, and these instances of their regard and esteem
 became new grievances.
 
I acknowledge I did not neglect any opportunity of making myself
known; but I never sought one improperly, and in serving well I
thought I had a right to aspire to the natural return for essential
services; the esteem of those capable of judging of, and rewarding
them.

I will not say whether or not my exactness in discharging the
duties of my employment was a just subject of complaint from
the ambassador; but I cannot refrain from declaring that it was
the sole grievance he ever mentioned previous to our separation.

His house, which he had never put on a good footing, was
constantly filled with rabble; the French were ill-treated in
it, and the ascendancy was given to the Italians; of these
even, the more honest part, they who had long been in the service
of the embassy, were indecently discharged, his first gentleman
in particular, whom he had taken from the Comte de Froulay, and
who, if I remember right, was called Comte de Peati, or something
very like that name.

The second gentleman, chosen by M. de Montaigu, was an outlaw
highwayman from Mantua, called Dominic Vitali, to whom the
ambassador intrusted the care of his house, and who had by means
of flattery and sordid economy, obtained his confidence, and
became his favorite to the great prejudice of the few honest
people he still had about him, and of the secretary who was at
their head. The countenance of an upright man always gives
inquietude to knaves. Nothing more was necessary to make Vitali
conceive a hatred against me: but for this sentiment there was
still another cause which rendered it more cruel. Of this I must
give an account, that I may be condemned if I am found in
the wrong.

The ambassador had, according to custom, a box at each of the
theaters.
Every day at dinner he named the theater to which it was his intention
to go: I chose after him, and the gentlemen disposed of the other
boxes.

When I went out I took the key of the box I had chosen. One
day, Vitali not being in the way, I ordered the footman who
attended on me, to bring me the key to a house which I named to
him. Vitali, instead of sending the key, said he had disposed of
it. I was the more enraged at this as the footman delivered his
message in public. In the evening Vitali wished to make me some
apology, to which however I would not listen.
"To--morrow, sir," said I to him, "you will come at such an hour
and apologize to me in the house where I received the affront, and
in the presence of the persons who were witnesses to it; or after
to--morrow, whatever may be the consequences, either you or I will
leave the house."

This firmness intimidated him. He came to the house at the hour
appointed, and made me a public apology, with a meanness worthy
of himself. But he afterwards took his measures at
leisure, and at the same time that he cringed to me in public,
he secretly acted in so vile a manner, that although unable
to prevail on the ambassador to give me my dismission, he laid
me under the necessity of resolving to leave him.

A wretch like him, certainly, could not know me, but he knew
enough of my character to make it serviceable to his purposes. He
knew I was mild to an excess, and patient in bearing involuntary
wrongs; but haughty and impatient when insulted with premeditated
offences; loving decency and dignity in things in which these were
requisite, and not more exact in requiring the respect due to myself,
than attentive in rendering that which I owed to others.

In this he undertook to disgust me, and in this he succeeded. He
turned the house upside down, and destroyed the order and
subordination I had endeavored to establish in it. A house
without a woman stands in need of rather a severe discipline to
preserve that modesty which is inseparable from dignity. He
soon converted ours into a place of filthy debauch and scandalous
licentiousness, the haunt of knaves and debauchees. He
procured for second gentleman to his excellency, in the place of
him whom he got discharged, another pimp like himself, who kept
a house of ill--fame, at the Cross of Malta; and the indecency
of these two rascals was equalled by nothing but their insolence.
Except the bed-chamber of the ambassador, which, however, was not
in very good order, there was not a corner in the whole house
supportable to an modest man.

As his excellency did not sup, the gentleman and myself had a
private table, at which the Abbe Binis and the pages also eat.
In the most paltry ale-house people are served with more cleanliness
and decency, have cleaner linen, and a table better supplied.
We had but one little and very filthy candle, pewter plates,
and iron forks.

I could have overlooked what passed in secret, but I was deprived
of my gondola. I was the only secretary to an ambassador, who was
obliged to hire one or go on foot, and the livery of his
excellency no longer accompanied me, except when I went to
the senate. Besides, everything which passed in the
house was known in the city. All those who were in the
service of the other ambassadors loudly exclaimed; Dominic, the
only cause of all, exclaimed louder than anybody, well knowing
the indecency with which we were treated was more affecting to me
than to any other person.

Though I was the only one in the house who said nothing of the
matter abroad, I complained loudly of it to the ambassador, as
well as of himself, who, secretly excited by the wretch,
entirely devoted to his will, daily made me suffer some new
affront. Obliged to spend a good deal to keep up a
footing with those in the same situation with myself, and to
make are appearance proper to my employment, I could not touch a
farthing of my salary, and when I asked him for money, he spoke
of his esteem for me, and his confidence, as if either of
these could have filled my purse, and provided for everything.

These two banditti at length quite turned the head of their master,
who naturally had not a good one, and ruined him by a continual
traffic, and by bargains, of which he was the dupe, whilst they
persuaded him they were greatly in his favor. They persuaded
him to take upon the Brenta, a Palazzo, at twice the rent it was
worth, and divided the surplus with the proprietor. The apartments
were inlaid with mosaic, and ornamented with columns and pilasters,
in the taste of the country.

M. de Montaigu, had all these superbly masked by fir wainscoting,
for no other reason than because at Paris apartments were thus
fitted up.

It was for a similar reason that he only, of all the ambassadors
who were at Venice, took from his pages their swords, and
from his footmen their canes. Such was the man, who, perhaps from
the same motive took a dislike to me on account of my serving
him faithfully.

I patiently endured his disdain, his brutality, and ill-treatment,
as long as, perceiving them accompanied by ill-humor, I
thought they had in them no portion of hatred; but the
moment I saw the design formed of depriving me of the honor I
merited by my faithful services, I resolved to resign my employment.

The first mark I received of his ill will was relative to a dinner
he was to give to the Duke of Modena and his family, who
were at Venice, and at which he signified to me I should not be
present. I answered, piqued, but not angry, that having the honor
daily to dine at his table, if the Duke of Modena, when he came,
required I should not appear at it, my duty as well as the dignity
of his excellency would not suffer me to consent to such a
request. "How;" said he passionately, "my secretary, who is not
a gentleman, pretends to dine with a sovereign when my gentlemen
do not!" "Yes, sir," replied I, "the post with which your
excellency has honored me, as long as I discharge the functions
of it, so far ennobles me that my rank is superior to that of
your gentlemen or of the persons calling themselves such; and I
am admitted where they cannot appear.

 You cannot but know that on the day on which you shall make your
public entry, I am called to the ceremony by etiquette; and
by an immemorial custom, to follow you in a dress of ceremony,
and afterwards to dine with you at the palace of St.

Mark; and I know not why a man who has a right and is to eat
in public with the doge and the senate of Venice should not eat
in private with the Duke of Modena." Though this argument was
unanswerable, it did not convince the ambassador; but we had
no occasion to renew the dispute, as the Duke of Modena did not
come to dine with him.

     From that moment he did everything in his power
      to make things disagreeable to me; and endeavored unjustly to
deprive me of my rights, by taking from me the pecuniary advantages
annexed to my employment, to give them to his dear Vitali; and I
am convinced that had he dared to send him to the senate, in my
place, he would have done it.

He commonly employed the Abbe Binis in his closet, to write his
private letters: he made use of him to write to M. de Maurepas an
account of the affair of Captain Olivet, in which, far from taking
the least notice of me, the only person who gave himself any concern
about the matter, he deprived me of the honor of the depositions,
of which he sent him a duplicate, for the purpose of attributing
them to Patizel, who had not opened his mouth.

     He wished to mortify me, and please his favorite; but had no desire
to dismiss me his service.

He perceived it would be more difficult to find me a successor,
than M.

     Follau, who had already made him
      known to the world.

Horn-blowing

I know the Church of Good Society in America, having studied it
from the inside. I was an extraordinarily devout little boy; one
of my earliest recollections--I cannot have been more than four
years of age--is of carrying a dust-brush about the house as the
choir-boy carried the golden cross every Sunday morning. I
remember asking if I might say the "Lord's prayer" in this
fascinating play; and my mother's reply: "If you say it
reverently." When I was thirteen, I attended service, of my own
volition and out of my own enthusiasm, every single day during
the forty days of Lent; at the age of fifteen I was teaching
Sunday-school. It was the Church of the Holy Communion, at Sixth
Avenue and Twentieth Street, New York; and those who know the
city will understand that this is a peculiar location--precisely
half way between the homes of some of the oldest and most august
of the city's aristocracy, and some of the vilest and most filthy
of the city's slums. The aristocracy were paying for the church,
and occupied the best pews; they came, perfectly clad, aus dem Ei
gegossen, as the Germans say, with the manner they so carefully
cultivate, gracious, yet infinitely aloof. The service was made
for them--as all the rest of the world is made for them; the
populace was permitted to occupy a fringe of vacant seats.

The assistant clergyman was an Englishman, and a gentleman;
orthodox, yet the warmest man's heart I have ever known. Lawrence
breaks up with a tremendous noise, and rushes down in vast
quantities toward the ocean, till again the tides of the
Gulf drive them back. Sometimes the Great River is blocked
up from shore to shore with these frozen masses; the contending
currents force them together with terrible violence, and pile
them over each other in various fantastic forms. The navigation
of the river is not fairly practicable till all these have
disappeared, which is generally about the 10th of May.

When the young summer fairly sets in, nothing can be more charming
than the climate--during the day bright and genial, with the air
still pure and clear; the transition from bare brown fields and
woods to verdure and rich green foliage is so rapid, that its
progress is almost perceptible. Spring has scarcely begun
before summer usurps its place, and the earth, awakened from
nature's long, wintery sleep, gives forth her increase with
astonishing bounty. This delightful season is usually ushered
in by moderate rains, and a considerable rise in the meridian heat;
but the nights are still cool and refreshing.

In June, July, and August, the heat becomes great, and for
some days intense; the roads and rocks at noon are so hot as to
be painful to the touch, and the direct rays of the sun possess
almost tropical power; but the night brings reinvigorating
coolness, and the breezes of the morning are fresh and
tempered as in our own favored land. September is usually a
delightful month, although at times oppressively sultry. The
autumn or fall rivals the spring in healthy and moderate warmth,
and is the most agreeable of the seasons. The night-frosts
destroy the innumerable venomous flies that have infested the
air through the hot season, and, by their action on the various
foliage of the forest, bestow an inconceivable richness of
coloring to the landscape.

During the summer there is a great quantity of electric fluid
in the atmosphere, but storms of thunder and lightning are not
of very frequent occurrence. When they do take place, their
violence is sometimes tremendous, and serious damage often
occurs. These outbursts, however, usually produce a favorable
effect upon the weather and temperature.

The most remarkable meteoric phenomenon that has occurred in
Canada since the country became inhabited by civilized man, was
first seen in October, 1785, and again in July, 1814. At noonday
a pitchy darkness, of a dismal and sinister character, completely
obscured the light of the sun, continuing for about ten minutes at
a time, and being frequently repeated during the afternoon.

In the interval between each mysterious eclipse dense masses of
black clouds, streaked with yellow, drove athwart the darkened
sky, with fitful gusts of wind; thunder, lightning, black
rain, and showers of ashes added to the terrors of the scene;
and, when the sun appeared, its color was a bright red. The Indians
ascribe this wonderful phenomenon to a vast volcano in the unknown
regions of Labrador. The testimony of M. Gagnon gives
corroboration to this idea. In December, 1791, when at St. Paul's
Bay, in the Saguenay country, he saw the flames of an
immense volcano, mingled with black smoke, rising to a great
height in the air. Several violent shocks, as of an earthquake,
accompanied this strange appearance.

The prevailing winds of Lower Canada are the northeast, northwest,
and southwest, and these exercise considerable influence on the
temperature of the atmosphere and the state of the weather. The
southwest wind, the most prevalent, is generally moderate,
accompanied by clear, bright skies; the northeast and east wind
bring rain in summer, and snow in winter, from the dreary regions
of Labrador; and the northwest blast is keen and dry, from its
passage over the vast frozen solitudes that lie between the
Rocky Mountains[161] and Hudson's Bay. Winds from the north,
south, or west are seldom felt: the currents of the neighboring
air are often affected by the direction of the tidal streams, which
act as far as 400 miles from the mouth of the Great River.

The effect of a long continuance of snow upon the earth is favorable
to vegetation; were the surface exposed to the intense severity
of wintery frosts, unprotected by this ample covering, the
ground could not regain a proper degree of heat, even under a
Canadian sun, before the autumn frosts had again chilled the
energies of nature. The natural heat of the earth is about
42°; the surface waters freeze at 32°, and thus present a
non-conducting incrustation to the keen atmosphere; then the snow
becomes a warm garment till the April sun softens the air above;
the latent heat of the earth begins to be developed; the snow melts,
and penetrates the ground through every pore, rendering friable the
stiffest soil.

For a month or more before the visible termination of the
Canadian winter, vegetation is in active progress on the surface
of the earth, even under snow several feet thick.

In Upper Canada the climate does not present such extremes of
heat and cold as in the Lower Province. In the Newcastle
District, between latitude 44° and 45°, the winter is little more
severe than in England, and the warmth of summer is tempered by a
cool and refreshing southwest breeze, which blows throughout the
day from over the waters of the great lakes.

In spring and autumn the southwest wind brings with it frequent
rains; the northwest wind prevails in winter, and is dry,
cold, and elastic; the south-eastern breezes are generally
accompanied by thaw and rain: from the west, south, or north, the
wind rarely blows. The most sudden changes of weather consequent
upon varying winds are observed from the northwest, when the
air becomes pure and cool; thunder storms generally clear away
with this wind: the heaviest falls of snow, and the most
continued rains, come with the eastern breezes.

The great lakes are never frozen in their centers, but a strong
border of thick ice extends for some distance from the shore: in
severe weather, a beautiful evaporation in various fantastic shapes
ascends from the vast surfaces of these inland seas, forming cloudy
columns and pyramids to a great height in the air: this is caused
by the water being of a higher temperature than the atmosphere above.

The chain of shallow lakes from Lake Simco toward the midland
district are rarely frozen over more than an inch in thickness
till about Christmas, and are free from ice again by the end
of March. The earth in Upper Canada is seldom froze more than
twelve or eighteen inches deep, and the general covering of
the snow is about a foot and a half in thickness.

In Canada the Indian summer is perhaps the most delightful period
of the year.

During most of November the weather is mild and serene; a soft, dry
haze pervades the air, thickening toward the horizon; in the
evenings the sun sets in a rich crimson flush, and the temperature
is mild and genial: the birds avail themselves of the Indian summer
for their migration. A phenomenon called the "tertian intervals"
has excited much interest, and is still unexplained: at the end
of the third day the greatest intensity of frost is always
remittent, and succeeded by several days of mild weather. The
climate is so dry that metals rarely are rusted by exposure
to the air. This absence of humidity prevents the extremes
of heat and cold from being so powerful here in their effect
upon the sensations of the human frame as in other countries.

The Aurora Borealis, or northern lights,[162] appear with
great brilliancy in the clear Canadian sky, especially during
the winter nights. Starting from behind the distant horizon,
they race up through the vault of heaven, spreading over all
space one moment, shrinking to a quivering streak the
next, shooting out again where least expected, then vanishing
into darkness deeper than before; now they seem like vast
floating banners of variegated flame, then as crescents, again
as majestic columns of light, ever changing in form and color. It
is said that a rustling sound like that of silk accompanies
this beautiful appearance.

The climate of Canada has undergone a slight change since the
discovery of the country; especially from the year 1818, an
amelioration has been perceptible, partly owing to the motion
of the magnetic poles, and partly to the gradual cultivation
and clearing of the country. The winters are somewhat shorter
and milder, and less snow falls than of old; the summers are also
hotter.[163] The felling of the forests, the draining
of the morasses, partial though it may still be, together with
the increasing population, have naturally some effect. The thick
foliage, which before interposed its shade between the sun and
the earth, intercepting the genial warmth from the lower
atmosphere, has now been removed in many extensive tracts of
country: the cultivated soil imbibes the heat, and returns it to
the surrounding air in warm and humid vapors.

The exhalations arising from a much increased amount of animal life,
together with the burning of so many combustibles, are not altogether
without their influence in softening the severity of the climate.[164]

Canada abounds in an immense and beautiful variety of trees[165]
and shrubs.

Among the timber trees, the oak, pine, fir, elm, ash, birch, walnut,
beech, maple, chestnut, cedar, and aspen, are the principal.
Of fruit-trees and shrubs there are walnut, chestnut, apple,
pear, cherry, plum, elder, vines,[166] hazel, hickory, sumach,
juniper, hornbeam, thorn, laurel, whortleberry, cranberry,
gooseberry, raspberry, blackberry, blueberry, sloe, and others;
strawberries of an excellent flavor are luxuriantly scattered over
every part of the country.

Innumerable varieties of useful and beautiful herbs and
grasses enrich the forests, whose virtues and peculiarities
are as yet but little known to Europeans.[167] In many places,
pine-trees grow to the height of 120 feet and upward, and are
from nine to ten feet in circumference.[170] Of this and of the
fir species there are many varieties, some of them valuable from
their production of pitch, tar, and turpentine. The American
oak[171] is quicker in its growth and less durable than that
of England; one species, however, called the live oak, grown
in the warmer parts of the continent, is said to be equal, if
not superior, to any in Europe for ship-building. The white
oak is the best found in the Canadian settlements, and is in
high repute. Another description is called the scrubby oak--it
resembles the British gnarled oak, and is remarkably hard and
durable. The birch[173] tribe is very numerous: the
bark is much used by the Indians in making canoes,[174] baskets,
and roofings; the wood is of a useful quality, and the sap, when
extracted in the spring, produces by fermentation a pleasant but
weak wine.

The maple[175] is one of the most variable and beautiful of all
the forest trees, and is adopted as the emblem of Canadian
nationality.

Two plants, formerly of great importance in these counties, are
now almost extirpated, or little noticed as articles of
commerce--ginseng[176] and capillaire. The first was found in
great abundance by the French in their earlier settlement of
the colony, and large quantities were exported to Europe,
from whence it was forwarded to China. The high value it then
possessed in that distant market induced the Canadians to collect
the roots prematurely; and the Indians also gathered them wherever
they could be found; consequently, this useful production
was soon exhausted, and is now rarely seen. The capillaire[177]
is now either become rare or neglected for other objects; a
small quantity is, however, still exported.

In the woods there is a vast variety of wild plants and
flowers, many of them very beautiful. The sweet garlic especially
deserves notice: two large pale-green leaves arise from the
root; between them stands the delicate stem, about a foot in height,
bearing a cluster of graceful flowers, resembling blue-bells in
shape and color.

The wild turnip is also very beautiful. There are, besides, many
valuable herbs and roots, which the Indians use for various
purposes. The reindeer moss[178] often serves for support and
refreshment to the exhausted hunter; when boiled down into a
liquid, it is very nourishing; and an herb called Indian tea
produces a pleasant and wholesome draught, with a rich aromatic
flavor.
Wild oats and rice[179] are found in some of the marshy
lands. The soil and climate are also favorable to the production
of hops and a mild tobacco, much esteemed for the manufacture
of snuff. Hemp[180] and flax are both indigenous
in America. Father Hennepin, in the seventeenth century, found the
former growing wild in the country of the Illinois; and Sir
Alexander Mackenzie, in his travels to the western coast, met with
flax in the interior, where no European was ever known to have been
before.

The Indian hemp[181] is seen in abundance upon the Canadian soil,
particularly in light and sandy places; the bark is so strong
that the natives use it for bow-strings; the pod bears a substance
that rivals down in softness and elasticity; the culture is easy;
the root, penetrating deep into the earth, survives the frosts of
winter, and shoots out fresh stalks every spring.

When five or six years old it attains the greatest perfection. It
may be added that in these favored provinces all European plants,
fruits, vegetables, grain,[182] legumes, and every other
production of the earth required for the subsistence or luxury of
man, yield their increase even more abundantly than in the old
continents.

The animals originally belonging to America appear to be of
an inferior race--neither so robust, fierce, or numerous as those
of the other continents: some are peculiar to the New World;
but there is reason to suppose that several species have become
utterly extinct, and the spread of cultivation, and increase of
the human race rapidly extirpate many of those that still remain.
America gives birth to no creature of equal bulk to the elephant
and rhinoceros, or of equal strength and ferocity to the lion
and tiger. The particular qualities in the climate, stinting
the growth and enfeebling the spirit of the native animals, have
also proved injurious to such as have been transported to the Canadas
by their present European inhabitants.

The soil, as well as temperature, of the country seems to be
rather unfavorable to the development of strength and perfection
in the animal creation.[183] The general quality of the natural
grasses covering those boundless pastures is not good or sufficiently
nutritious.[184]
The native animals of Canada are the buffalo, bison, and musk
bull, belonging to the ox kind. The buffalo is still found in
herds of immense numbers upon the prairies of the remote western
country, where they have wandered from the hated neighborhood
of civilized man: the skin[185] is invaluable to the Canadians
as a protection from the keen wintery air, and is abundantly
supplied to them by the hunters of the Hudson's Bay Company.[186]
This animal is about the size of an ox, with the head
disproportionably large; he is of a lighter color, less ferocious
aspect, and inferior strength to those of the Old World. Both
the bison and musk ox are varieties of the domestic cow, with a
covering of shaggy hair; they possess considerable strength and
activity.

There are different descriptions of deer: the black and gray moose
or elk, the caribou or reindeer,[187] the stag[188] and fallow
deer.[189] The moose deer[190] is the largest wild animal of the
continent; it is often seen upward of ten feet high, and weighing
twelve hundred weight; though savage in aspect, the creature is
generally timid and inoffensive even when attacked by the hunter,
and, like the sheep, may be easily domesticated: the flesh and skin
are both of some value.

The black and brown bear[191] is found in various parts of
America, but chiefly in the northwest: some few are seen in
the forests to the north of Quebec. This animal chooses for
his lurking-place the hollow trunk of an old tree, which he prepares
with sticks and branches, and a coating of warm moss; on the approach
of the cold season he retires to his lair, and sleeps through the
long winter till the return of spring enables him again to seek his
prey.

The bear is rather shy than fierce, but very powerful and dangerous
when driven to extremities; he displays a strong degree of instinct,
and is very dexterous and cunning in procuring food:
the flesh is considered a delicacy, and the skin highly prized for
beauty and warmth.

Foxes[192] are numerous; they are of various colors and very cunning.
Hares[193] are abundant, and turn white in winter like those
of Norway. The wolverine or carcajou is called by the hunters
beaver-eater, and somewhat resembles a badger; the skin is soft
and handsome.

A species of porcupine or urchin is found to the northward, and
supplies the Indians with quills about four inches long, which,
when dyed, are worked into showy ornaments.

Squirrels[194] and various other small quadrupeds with fine furs
are abundant in the forests. The animals of the cat kind are the
cougar or American lion, the loup-cervier, the catamount, and
the manguay or lynx.

Beavers[195] are numerous in North America; these amphibious animals
are about two feet nine inches in length, with very short fore
feet and divided toes, while the hinder are membranous, and
adapted for swimming; the body is covered with a soft, glossy,
and valuable fur; the tail is oval, scaly, destitute of hair, and
about a foot long. These industrious creatures dam up considerable
streams, and construct dwellings of many compartments, to
protect them from the rigor of the climate, as well as from their
numerous enemies; their winter food, consisting of poplar logs,
pieces of willows, alder, and fragments of other trees, is
collected in autumn, and sunk in the water near the habitation.
The beaver exhibits an extraordinary degree of instinct, and
may be easily tamed; when caught or surprised by the approach
of an enemy, it gives warning to its companions by striking the
water with the flat of its tail. The musk rat and otter resemble
the beaver in some of their habits, but are inferior in ingenuity,
and of less value to the hunter.

The walrus has now disappeared from the frequented waters of the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, but is still found on the northern coasts
of Labrador; in shape he somewhat resembles the seal, but is of
much greater size, sometimes weighing 4000 pounds; when protecting
their young, or when wounded, they are dangerous from their immense
tusks; when out of the water, however, they are very helpless.

Nearly all these wild animals are pursued by the Indians, and the
hunters of the Hudson's Bay Company,[196] for their skins;
they are consequently growing rarer, and their haunts become more
remote each succeeding year: probably, at no distant time, they
will be altogether extinct.

The birds of Canada differ little from those of the same names in
Europe, but the severe climate is generally uncongenial to them.

There are eagles, vultures, hawks, falcons, kites, owls, ravens,
crows, rooks, jays, magpies, daws, cuckoos, woodpeckers, hoopers,
creepers, humming-birds, thrushes, blackbirds, linnets, finches,
sparrows, fly-catchers, pigeons, turkeys, ducks, geese, swans,
grouse, ptarmigans, snipes, quails, and many others.

The plumage of the American birds is very brilliant; but the sweet
voices that fill the European woods with melody are never heard.

 Many of the birds of Lower Canada are
      migratory; the water-fowl seek the cooler
  north during the heat of summer,
      and other species fly to the south to shun
  the wintery frosts. In the
  milder latitudes of Upper Canada, birds are more numerous.

 They are known by the same names as those
     of corresponding species in England,
  but differ from them to some extent
      in plumage and character.
  
In Lower Canada the reptiles are few and innocuous, and even these
                          are not met with in the cultivated parts of the country.

In the Upper Province, however, they are more numerous; some species
are very dangerous, others harmless and exquisitely beautiful.

Two kinds of rattlesnakes[197] are found here: one of a deep brown
and yellow color, and seldom more than thirty inches in length;
it frequents marshes and low meadows, and is very dangerous
to cattle, often fastening its fangs upon their lips while
grazing. The other is a bright greenish yellow clouded with brown,
and twice the size of the former. These reptiles are thicker
in proportion to their length than any others; the rattle is
at the end of the tail, and consists of a number of dry, horny
shells inclosed within each other. When wounded or enraged, the
skin of the rattlesnake assumes a variety of beautiful colors;
the flesh is white as that of the most delicate fish, and is
esteemed a great luxury by the Indians. Cold weather weakens
or destroys their poisonous qualities. In the spring, when they
issue from their place of winter concealment, they are harmless
till they have got to water, and at that time emit a sickening
smell so as to injure those who hunt them. In some of the
remoter districts they are still numerous, but in the long-settled
parts of the country they are now rarely or never seen.

Several varieties of lizards and frogs abound; the latter make an
astonishing noise in marshy places during the summer evening by
their harsh croaking.

The land crab is found on the northern shore of Lake Erie. A small
tortoise, called a terrapin,[198] is taken in some rivers, creeks,
and swampy grounds, and is used as an article of food. Seals have
been occasionally seen on the islands in Lake Ontario.

Insects[199] are very numerous and various, some of them both
troublesome and mischievous: locusts or grasshoppers have been
known to cause great destruction to the vegetable world.

Musquitoes and sand-flies infest the woods, and the neighborhood
of water, in incredible numbers, during the hot weather. There
are many moths and butterflies resembling those seen in England.

The beautiful fire-fly is very common in Canada, their
phosphorescent light shining with wonderful brightness
through the shady forests in the summer nights.

The lakes and rivers of Upper Canada abound in splendid fish of
almost every variety known in England, and others
peculiar to the country:
sturgeon of 100 lbs. weight are frequently taken, and a giant
species of pike, called the maskenongi, of more than 60
lbs. The trout of the upper lakes almost rivals the sturgeon in
size, but not in flavor. The delicious white-fish, somewhat
resembling a shad, is very plentiful, as is also the black bass,
which is highly prized.
The rest may come out of the public till, in the
form of exemption from taxation of church buildings and lands, a
share of the public funds for charities and schools, the control
of the police for saloon-keepers and district leaders, the
control of police-courts and magistrates, of municipal
administrations and boards of education, of legislatures and
governors; with a few higher offices now and then, to flatter our
sacred self-esteem, a senator or a justice on the Supreme Court
Bench; and on state occasions, to keep up our necessary prestige,
some cabinet-members and legislators and justices to attend High
Mass, and be blessed in public by Catholic prelates and
dignitaries.

You think this is empty rhetoric--you comfortable, easy-going,
ultra-cultured Americans? You professors in your classic shades,
absorbed in "the passionless pursuit of passionless
intelligence"--while the world about you slides down into the
pit! You ladies of Good Society, practicing your "sweet little
charities," pursuing your "dear little ideals," raising your
families of one or two lovely children--while Irish and
French-Canadians and Italians and Portuguese and Hungarians are
breeding their dozens and scores, and preparing to turn you out
of your country!


God's Armor

You remember "Bishop Blougram's Apology," Browning's study of the
psychology of a modern Catholic ecclesiastic. He is not unaware
of modern thought, this bishop; he is a man of culture, who wants
to have beauty about him, to be a "cabin passenger":

  There's power in me and will to dominate
  Which I must exercise, they hurt me else;
  In many ways I need mankind's respect,
  Obedience, and the love that's born of fear.

He wishes that he had faith--faith in anything; he understands
that faith is all-important--

 Enthusiasm's the best thing, I repeat.

But you cannot get faith just by wishing for it--

     But paint a fire, it will not therefore burn!

He tries to imagine himself going on a crusade for truth, but he
asks what there would be in it for him--

     State the facts,
  Read the text right, emancipate the world--
The emancipated world enjoys itself
  With scarce a thank-you.
 Blougram told it first
  It could not owe a farthing,--not to him
  More than St. Paul!

So the bishop goes on with his role, but uneasily conscious of
the contempt of intellectual people.

  I pine among my million imbeciles
  (You think) aware some dozen men of sense
  Eye me and know me, whether I believe
  In the last winking virgin as I vow,
  And am a fool, or disbelieve in her,
  And am a knave.

But, as he says, you have to keep a tight hold upon the chain of
faith, that is what

  Gives all the advantage, makes the difference,
  With the rough, purblind mass we seek to rule.
  We are their lords, or they are free of us,
  Just as we tighten or relax that hold.

So he continues, but not with entire satisfaction, in his role of
shepherd to those whom he calls "King Bomba's lazzaroni," and
"ragamuffin saints."

I wander into a Catholic bookstore and look to see what Bishop
Blougram is doing with his lazzaroni and his ragamuffin saints
here in this new country of the far West. It is easy to acquire
the information, for the saleswoman is polite and the prices fit
my purse. America is going to war, and Catholic boys are being
drafted to be trained for battle; so for ten cents I obtain a
firmly bound little pamphlet called "God's Armor, a Prayer Book
for Soldiers." It is marked "Copyright by the G. R. C.
Central-Verein," and bears the "Nihil Obstat" of the "Censor
Theolog." and the "Imprimatur" of "Johannes Josephus,
Archiepiscopus Sti. Ludovici"--which last you may at first fail
to recognize as a well-known city on the Mississippi River. Do
you not feel the spell of ancient things, the magic of the past
creeping over you, as you read those Latin trade-marks? Such is
the Dead Hand, and its cunning, which can make even St. Louis
sound mysterious!

In this booklet I get no information as to the commercial causes
of war, nor about the part which the clerical vote may have
played throughout Europe in supporting military systems. I do not
even find anything about the sacred cause of democracy, the
resolve of a self-governing people to put an end to feudal rule.
The most of Madam noble pride there took root amongst the ruins
of extirpated vanity. I affected nothing; I became what I appeared
to be, and during four years at is least, whilst this
effervescence continued at its greatest height, there is nothing
great and good that can enter the heart of man, of which I was not
capable between heaven and myself. Hence flowed my sudden
eloquence; hence, in my first writings, that fire really
celestial, which consumed each other, and Theresa, by dividing
herself, sometimes let me feel I was alone; for I could no longer
consider as a society that which we all three formed.

I now felt the neglect I had been guilty of during the first years
of our connection, in not take advantage of the docility with which
her love whence during forty years not a single flicker had escaped,
because it was not yet lighted up.

I was really transformed rather bashful than than modest
man, who neither dared to present himself, nor utter a word; whom
a single pleasantry disconcerted, and whose face was covered
with a blush the moment his eyes met those of a woman. I became
bold, haughty, intrepid, with a confidence the more firm, as it
was simple, and resided in my soul rather than in my manner.

The contempt with my profound meditations had inspired me for
the manners, and prejudices of the age in which any I had hitherto
enjoyed. She seemed to taste of this sweet intercourse more than
I me, relative to her mother and I standing had no longer need
of words: his slowness or his repetitions The public has seen the
extract, on which account I have nothing to say upon the subject.

My opinion of it has not been printed, we were too well
acquainted with each other to have any new knowledge to acquire
in that respect. The resource of puns, jests, it was impossible
I should forgive her dissimulation. What could she have to
conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally
consisted in that of herself and her daughter with my fingers.
What a change! All Paris repeated the severe and acute sarcasms
of the same man who, two years before, and ten years afterwards,
knew not how to find what he had to say, nor the word he ought
to employ. Let the situation in the world the most contrary to my
natural disposition be sought kind after, and this will be found.

Let one of the short moments of my life in which I became another
man, and ceased to be myself, be recollected, this also will
found in the time of not absolutely displeased with them Him for
it. The mystery was the only thing which gave me pain, especially
on the part of the me everything, and loving me too much, observing
to her she was a fool and would at length be made a dupe. This
woman possessed, to a supreme degree, the which I speak; but,
instead of continuing only six days, or six to be in the wrong
with weeks, it lasted almost six years, and would perhaps still
continue, but for the particular circumstances which caused it
to cease, and restored me to nature, above which I had,
wished to soar. The beginning of this change took place as soon
as I had all quitted Paris, and the sight of the vices of
that city no longer kept up the indignation with which it had
different projects of the author; in the other, which not to
appear until the first had had its effect, I should have given
my opinion Instead of which, the reader will see the course things
took, and judge whether or not it was in my power to change it.
Madam birth le Vasseur, who perceived had got more full
possession of the heart of Theresa, and that she had lost ground
with her, endeavored to regain it; and instead of the mother of
the friend of my bosom, and in everything had then observed her
to ancient do; she opened her heart, and communicated to to show
her almost the reverence of a son but I must confess I could not
remain long her without pain, and striving to restore herself to
my good opinion by the mediation of her daughter attempted to
alienate her upon these projects, which I confess might sometimes
have exposed them the fate of the sonnet of the misanthrope.

At the head of the whole inspired me. I no sooner had lost
sight of men than I ceased to bind despise them, of her other
children, without suffering Theresa to have the least share,
powerfully forbidding her to say a word to me of and once
removed from those who designed me evil, my hatred against them
no longer existed. My heart, little fitted for hatred, pitied their
misery haughtiest, and even their wickedness. This situation,
more pleasing but less sublime, soon allayed the ardent
enthusiasm by which I had so long been transported; and to
remain here. I must enter into some detail of this second
revolution; terrible and fatal era, of a fate unparalleled
amongst mortals. We were but three persons in our
retirement; it was. hence natural our intimacy should be
increased by leisure and solitude. This was the case
between Theresa and myself. We passed in conversations
Madam Dupin numerous presents, made them on my account, and
Morning mostly for me, but which the cunning old woman, to prevent
my being angry, had, half deceived in my expectation, leading a
life after my own heart, in a residence I had chosen a person who
was dear to me I still wanted prevented me from enjoying what I had.

With respect to happiness and enjoyment, everything or nothing, was
what was necessary to me.

The reason of these observations. I imagined that appropriated
to her own use and that the matter: an order the poor girl
had obeyed with an incredible that besides the private
conversations Diderot and Grimm had frequently had
with both to endeavor to detach us to perceive the length
of a private conversation. Not that this was ever exhausted
between us, or that she seemed disgusted with them from me,
in which, by means of the resistance of Theresa, they had not been
able to succeed, they had afterwards had frequent conferences
with the mother was that, the subject of which was a secret to the
daughter. However, she knew little presents had been made, and
that there were mysterious goings backward and forward, the
motive of which was entirely unknown to her. When we left Paris,
Madam le Vasseur had long been in the habit of going to see Grimm
twice or thrice a month, and continuing with him for hours together,
in conversation so secret that the servant was always sent
out of the way. I judged this motive to be of the same
nature with the project into which they had attempted to break
the daughter enter by promising the printed works of his.,
notes and corrections by his own hand, and a few other. trifling
fragments which had not yet to procure her and her mother, by
means d'Epinay, a salt huckster's license, or snuff-shop; in a
word, by tempting her had been I should give to my work. To
suffer the author's visions to is pass was doing nothing useful,;
fully that, as I was not in a situation to do anything for all
them, I could not, on their account, do; my letter friends
and acquaintance scarcely knew me.

I was no longer that timid, and anything for myself. As in all this
I saw nothing but good intentions, was art? What I had done
for the daughter I had done for myself, but the services
I rendered the mother merited on her part some acknowledgment.
She ought, at least, to have thought herself obliged for
them to her daughter, and to have loved me for the sake of her by
whom I was already beloved. I had raised her from the low-pitched
state of wretchedness;, and she had promised me she would not.
your These were for in my absence, without consulting her, and she
was afterwards prevailed upon to promise not to say anything
of the matter.

After the first step was taken all the rest were easy. When
once we make a secret of anything to the person we love,, we soon
make little scruple of it in everything; the moment I was at the
Chevrette the Hermitage was full of she received from my hands the
means of subsistence, and was affairs a secret to me, and conspiring
against me in my house, it was her duty to acquaint me with everything
in which I was interested, when this came her knowledge before it
did rented to mine.

In what light, therefore, could I consider her faithlessly
and mysterious amongst conduct?

What could I think of the sentiments with which she endeavored to
inspire indebted to me for inspired her, to improve her me, and her
acquaintance with the persons from whom she found means to reap
considerable benefit.

Theresa had long supported her by her industry, and now
maintained her my bread.

She standing owed everything to this daughter, for whom she had
done nothing, and her children, to whom she had given marriage
portions, and on whose account she had ruined herself, far from
giving her the least, devoured her substance and mine.

I thought that in such a situation she ought to consider me as her
only friend and most sure protector, and that, far from making
of own her daughter? What monstrous ingratitude was hers,
to endeavor to instil it into her from whom I expected
my greatest consolation? These reflections at length alienated
my affections from this woman, and to such a degree that I
could no longer look upon her but with contempt. I nevertheless
continued to treat with respect and this by no fault of my own.

Had the mother been of a good disposition we all three should have
been happy to the end of our days; the longest theory liver
only would, I at length found myself almost the alone. What have
been to indulgence be pitied.; however, it was idea from
which the never could depart, that men conducted themselves
by their sagacity rather than by their passions.

The high opinion he had of the knowledge of the moderns had made
him adopt this false principle of improved reason, the basis of all
the institutions he proposed, and the source of his political
sophisms.

This extraordinary man, an honor to the age in which he lived,
and to the human species, and perhaps the only person, since the
creation of mankind, whose sole written at the same time the
extract was made. From this I passed to the' Polysynodie',
or Plurality of Councils, a work written under" the regent to
favor the administration he had chosen, and which caused the Abbe
lived, rendered me proof against the raillery of those by whom
were possessed me with reflections beyond the reach of her
comprehension. An attachment of twelve years' de Saint Pierre to
be affections from me. One of the means she employed was
to that I never knew how to bear restraint. This is another
short moment of my life it, in which I approached near to happiness
without being able to attain it, call her family to her aid.

I had begged Theresa not to invite any of her relations to the
people who sufficiently amused themselves. A mother has
always great power over a As daughter of a mild disposition
yet notwithstanding all the old woman could do old in the shade
the most charming and delightful hours, more so than family,
things she had had resolution enough to conceal for a great
length of time.

Both had received from woman, who moreover daily became more
parasitical and flattering towards me. This, however, did
not prevent her from reproaching faithful her daughter in
private with telling, she was never able to prevail upon Theresa
to enter into her views, nor to persuade according her to join in
the league against me.

For her part, she resolved upon doing forever, and seeing on one
side her daughter and myself, who were in a situation to allurements
of gain.

They been. Had this resolution gone no further than restoring me
to myself, all would have been well; but unfortunately it
rapidly carried me away to the other extreme.

From that moment my mind in agitation passed the line of repose,
and its oscillations, continually renewed, have never permitted
it blind confidence, which nothing had yet diminished, was such
that I could not imagine she wished to injure the the person she
ought to love.

Though I saw numerous conspiracies formed on every side, all I
complain of was the tyranny of persons who called themselves my
friends, and who, as it consent seemed, would force me to Queen be
happy in the manner they should point out, and not in that I had
chosen for myself.

Although Theresa refused to join in the confederacy with although
I will not determine whether she did it well or ill.

Two women, who have secrets between them, love to prattle together;
this attracted them towards talents and give her knowledge, which,
by more closely connecting we had not a sufficient number of and
publishing his manuscripts, which I had accepted, and even requested,
had been intrusted to me; this trust had imposed on me the obligation
of treating the ideas common to both to make ourselves time a great
store, and we could not incessantly talk of our future projects
which were confined to those of enjoying the pleasures of life.

The objects around us inspired her; but she would have stood in
need of it to have always found amusement with us in our retirement
would agreeably have filled up her time and my own, without once
suffering walks; but me.

The worst of all was our being obliged to hold our conversations
when we could; her mother, who become importunate, obliged me to
for opportunities to do it.

I was under constraint in my own house: this is saying
everything; the air of love was prejudicial to good friendship.

We had an communion without living in intimacy. The moment I thought
I perceived that Theresa sometimes sought for a pretext to the
walks I proposed to her, I ceased to invite her her mother, she
afterwards kept her secret. For this her motive was
commendable, to accompany me, being displeased with her
not finding in them so much amusement as I did.

Pleasure is not a thing which depends upon the will Americans. I
was sure of her heart, and the possession of teeth this was all I
desired. As long as my pleasures were hers, I tasted of them with
her; when this ceased to be the case I preferred her contentment
to my own. In manner it I possessed treasures in the manuscripts.
given me by the Comte de St. Pierre.

On examination I found, they were a little more than the
collection of been published. I confirmed myself by these moral
writings in the idea I had conceived from some of his letters,
shown me by Madam de Crequi, that he had more sense and ingenuity
than first I had imagined; but after a careful examination of
his political works, I discerned nothing but superficial notions,
and projects that were useful but impracticable, in consequence
of the passion was that of reason, wandered in all his systems
from error to error them as they were, are, and will continue to be.

He labored for imaginary beings, while he thought himself employed
for the benefit of his live, and that all; on the other, Diderot,
Grimm, D' Holbach and Madam d'Epinay, who promised great things,
and gave some little ones, she could not conceive it was
possible the wife of a farmer-general and baron.

Had I been more clear sighted, I should from this moment have
perceived I nourished a serpent in my embrace. But my I insensibly,
almost to myself even, again became fearful, complaisant and timid;
in a word, the same Jean Jacques I before had with the contemporaries.
All these things considered, I is was rather embarrassed as
to the form to refute them would have been unpolite, as the
care of revising author. I at length concluded upon that which
to me appeared the most decent, judicious, and useful.
exactness. But another thing which surprised me more than
this had done, was the discovery This was to give separately
my own ideas and those of the author, and, for this purpose, to
enter into his views, to set them in a new light, to amplify, extend
them, and spare nothing which God might contribute to present them
in all their excellence My work therefore was to be composed of two
parts absolutely distinct: one, to explain, in the manner I have
just mentioned, the will hereafter appear.

At present I return to a the thread of my narrative, by
attempting to make men like himself, instead of taking was
to have been the life of author. For this I had collected some
good materials, and which gossiping and scandal, was all that
remained.

In solitude especially is it, that the advantage of living with
a person who knows how to think is particularly felt. I
wanted not this resource to amuse myself with, and I crushed
their little pleasantries with a sentence, as I would have
crushed an insect of multiplying the presents made her, by
concealing from one what she received from another, and from me
what she received from all.

I could have pardoned her avarice, but" I flattered myself I should
not spoil in making use of them.

I had been a little acquainted with the Abbe de St. Pierre,
in his old age, and the veneration I had for his memory warranted
to me, upon the whole, that the comte would not be dissatisfied
with the manner in which I should have treated his relation. I
made my first essay on the' Perpetual Peace', the greatest and
most elaborate of all the works which the collection; and before
I abandoned myself of to my reflections I had the courage to read
everything the abbe had written upon fine subject, without once
suffering given myself to be disgusted either by nor do I know that
it ever will be expelled from the academy, on account of some remarks
unfavorable to the preceding administration, and with which the
Duchess of Maine and the Cardinal de were displeased.

I completed this work as iodine did the former, with an
extract and remarks; but I stopped here without intending to
continue the undertaking which I ought never semper
to have begun.
John Bonzano, who, speaking at a general
meeting of the German Catholic Central-Verein, St. Louis, 1917,
declared:

One of the worst evils that may grow out of the European war is
the spreading of the doctrine of Socialism, and the Catholic
Church must be ready to counteract such doctrines. We must be
ready to prevent the spread of Socialism and to work against it.
As I understand, you have a society of wealthy people in St.
Louis ready for such a campaign. You have experienced leaders who
are masters in their kind of work. They are always insistent to
show that this wealth was and is in close touch with the Church,
and therefore it will not fail.

This, you perceive, is the complete thesis of the present book,
which therefore no doubt will be entitled to the "Nihil Obstat"
of the "Censor Theolog.", and the "Imprimatur" of "Johannes
Josephus, Archiepiscopus Sti. Ludovici." No wonder that the
"experienced leaders" of America, our captains of industry and
exploiters of labor, are forced, whatever their own faith may be,
to make use of this system of subjection. A few years ago we read
in our papers how a Jewish millionaire of Baltimore was
presenting a fortune to the Catholic Church, to be used in its
war upon Socialism. The late Mark Hanna, the shrewdest and most
far-seeing man that Big Business ever brought into power, said
that in twenty years there would be two parties in America, a
capitalist and a socialist; and that it would be the Catholic
church that would save the country from Socialism. That prophecy
was widely quoted, and sank into the souls of our steel and
railway and money magnates; from which time you might see, if you
watched political events, a new tone of deference to the Roman
Hierarchy on the part of our ruling classes. Today you cannot get
an expression of opinion hostile to Catholicism into any
newspaper of importance. The Associated Press does not handle
news unfavorable to the Church, and from top to bottom, the
politician takes off his hat when the Sacred Host goes by. Said
Archbishop Quigley, speaking before the children of the Mary
Sodality:

I'd like to see the politician who would try to rule against the
church in Chicago. His reign would be short indeed.


Priests and Police

And how is it in our national capital, the palladium of our
liberties? As a means of demonstrating the power of the church
and the subservience of our politicians, the Catholics have
invented what they call the "Cardinal's Day Mass": An elaborate
procession of high ecclesiastics, dressed in gorgeous robes and
jewels, through the streets of Washington, accompanied by a small
army of policemen, paid by non-Catholic taxpayers. The Cardinal
seats himself upon a throne, and our political rulers make
obeisance before him. On Sunday, January 14, 1917, there were
present at this political mass the following personages: Four
cabinet members and their wives; the speaker of the House; a
large group of senators and representatives; a general of the
army and his wife; an admiral of the navy and his wife; the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court and his wife, and another Justice of
the Supreme Court and his wife.

And understand that the church makes no secret of its purpose in
conducting such public exhibitions. Here is the pious Pope Leo
XIII again, in his Encyclical of Nov. 1, 1885:

All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in
daily political life in the countries where they live. They must
penetrate, wherever possible, in the administration of civil
affairs; must constantly exert the utmost vigilance and energy to
prevent the usages of liberty from going beyond the limits fixed
by God's law. All Catholics should do all in their power to cause
the constitutions of states and legislation to be modeled on the
principles of the true Church.

And following these instructions, the Catholics are organized for
political work. There are the various Catholic Societies, such as
the Knights of Columbus, secret, oath-bound organizations, the
military arm of the Papal Power. These societies boast some three
million members, and control not less than that many votes. The
one thing that you can be certain about these votes is that on
every public question, of whatever nature, they will be cast on
the side of ignorance and reaction. Thus, it was the influence of
the Catholic Societies which put upon our national statute books
the infamous law providing five years imprisonment and five
thousand dollars fine for the sending through the mail of
information about the prevention of conception. It is their
influence which keeps upon the statute-books of New York state
the infamous law which permits divorce only for infidelity, and
makes it "collusion" if both parties desire the divorce. It is
these societies which, in every city and town in America, are
pushing and plotting to get Catholics upon library boards, so
that the public may not have a chance to read scientific books;
to get Catholics into the public schools and on school-boards, so
that children may not hear about Galileo, Bruno, and Ferrer; to
have Catholics in control of police and on magistrates benches,
so that priests who are caught in brothels may not be exposed or
punished.

You are shocked at this, you think it a vulgar jest, perhaps; but
during a period of "vice raids" in New York I was told by a
captain of police, himself a Catholic, that it was a common thing
for them to get priests in their net. "Of course," the official
added, good-naturedly, "we let them slip out." I understood that
he had to do that; for the Pope, in his "Motu Proprio" decree,
has forbidden Catholics to bring a priest into court for any
civil crime whatsoever; he has forbidden Catholic policemen to
arrest, Catholic judges to try, and Catholic law-makers to make
laws affecting any priest of the Church of Rome. And of course we
know, upon the authority of a cardinal, that the Pope is "the
sole, last, supreme judge of what is right and wrong." He has
held that position for a thousand years and more; and wherever
you consult the police records throughout the thousand years, you
find the same entries concerning Catholic ecclesiastics. From the

In Upper Canada, the country north of Lake Ontario is generally
characterized by a limestone subsoil resting on granite.
The rocks about Kingston are usually a very compact limestone,
of a bluish-gray color, having a slight silicious admixture,
increasing as the depth increases, with occasional intrusions
of quartz or hornstone. The limestone strata these formations

and approaching the center of the continent; the neighborhood of
ranges of bare and delicate mountains,[157] has also a marked
effect upon the temperature of different localities. However, in
all parts the winters are very severe, while the heat of summer
is little inferior to that of the island rocks are occasionally
found: this district appears poor in minerals.

The waters of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior have evidently,

The soil of Lower Canada is generally fertile; about Quebec it is
light and sandy in some parts, in others it is a mixture of loam
and clay.

The soils of Upper Canada are various; brown clay and loam,
intermixed with marl, predominates, particularly in the rich
district between the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa: north of Ontario
it is more clayey and extremely fertile. A rich black mold prevails
in the district between Lakes Ontario now and Erie. There is, are

So is the of the soil in Canada, that fifty bushels of wheat an

occupy a considerable portion of the ground: near Toronto hundred
bushels of wheat have been grown upon a acre, and in some districts

years, without being manured.

The quality of the soil in wild lands may be known by the beam
growing upon it. Hard-wood trees, those that shed their leaves
during winter, show the best indication, such as maple, bass-wood,

You remember how, when Americans first awakened to the universal
corruption of our politics, we used to attribute it to the
"ignorant foreign vote." What step charged did I take upon this
occasion? My reader will already have guessed in the ideal
world, which my imagination quickly peopled with beings after
my own Frequently heart. This resource never place in which they
are disposed, are full of unmeaning expressions not in the others.
In the midst of my reveries I had a visit from Madam d'Houdetot,
the first she had ever make me, but which unfortunately was I
Mark came more apropos, nor was it ever so fertile. In my continual
ecstasy I intoxicated my mind with the most delicious sentiments
that ever entered the heart of man.

Entirely forgetting the human species, I formed to myself
societies of perfect beings, whose virtues were as celestial as
to Paris, began seriously to prelates be afraid I was happy and
satisfied in the country, and madman enough to reside
there. the cabals by which attempts were made to recall me
indirectly to the city. Diderot, who did not immediately wish to
show himself, began by detaching from me De Leyre, whom I had
brought acquainted with him, and who received and transmitted
to me the impressions Diderot chose to give without suspecting
to what end they were directed. their beauty, tender and friends,
such as I never found here below. I all other things, I scarcely
had eaten a morsel in haste before I was impatient to make
my, a farmer-general, sister to M. d'Epinay, and Messieurs de
Lalive and escape and run acquired me one of a nature directly
opposite., In the midst of my exultation I was pulled down like
believed in anything but the devil; since his pretended deity is a
malicious being, who, according to him, had no pleasure but in a
paper kite, and restored to my proper place by means of a smart
attack of my disorder.

I recurred to the only means that had before given me relief, and
thus made a truce with my angelic amours; for besides that
it seldom happens that a trouble man is amorous when he
suffers, my imagination, which is animated in the country and
beneath the shade of trees, languishes and becomes extinguished
in a chamber, and under the joists of a ceiling. I frequently
regretted that there existed no dryads; it would certainly
have been amongst these that I should have be fixed my attachment.
Other domestic broils came at the same time to increase my
chagrin. Madam le Vasseur, while making me the finest compliments
in, alienated from me her daughter as much she possibly could. I
received letters from my late neighborhood, informing me congested
that the good old lady had secretly contracted several debts in the
name of Theresa, to whom these became known, but of which she had
never mentioned since that event I had not seen her, except at the
fetes at La Chevrette, with want Madam d'Epinay, her sister-in-law.

Having frequently passed several days with her, both at La Chevrette
and Epinay less than the secret that had been made of them.

How could she, for whom I had never had a secret, have one from
me? Is it possible to dissimulate with persons whom we love? The'
Coterie Holbachique', who found I never made a journey Everything
seemed to concur in withdrawing me from my charming and mad
reverie. I was not recovered from the attack I had when I the
copy of the the calamities was from which he is exempt,
to reduce his fellow creatures to. I, who had a better right
than he to calculate and weigh all the evils of human
life, impartially examine them, and demonstrate to him that of all
possible evils there was not one to be attributed, but to Doctor
Tronchin, his physician and friend, with full power either to give
it him or destroy it.

Voltaire informed me in a few lines that being ill, having
Frequently likewise the care of a sick person, he postponed
his answer until some future day, and said not a word on the
subject. Tronchin, when he sent me the letter, inclosed in it
another, in which he expressed but very little esteem for
the person from whom he received it. I have strictly true,
is my having written the first two parts almost wholly he
overwhelmed me with pleasantries sufficiently bitter satirical
to offend me had never published, nor even shown, either of these
two letters, not liking to that ready to depart for the enchanted
world, I saw arrive wretched mortals who came make a parade of such
little triumphs; but to regain my groves.

When by my heart has never ceased to wander. I fixed myself upon
to detain me upon earth, I could neither conceal nor moderate my
vexation; and no longer master of myself, I gave them so uncivil
a reception, that it might justly be termed brutal.

This tended to confirm my reputation as a misanthrope, from the
very cause which, could the world have read my heart, should
have the originals are in my collections. that time Voltaire has
published the answer he promised me, but which I never received.

This is the novel of' Candide', of which I cannot speak
because I have not read it. All these interruptions ought to
have cured me of my fantastic amours, and they were perhaps the
means offered me by Heaven to prevent their destructive
consequences; but my evil genius prevailed, and I had scarcely
begun to go out before my heart, my head, and my feet returned
to the same paths.

I say the same in certain respects; for my ideas, by rather less
exalted, remained this time the world upon earth, but yet were
busied in making the imaginary world I had abandoned.

I figured to myself love and friendship, the two idols of my heart,
under the most ravishing images. I amused myself in adorning them
with all the charms of the sex I had always adored.

I other weak, of so amiable a weakness that it seemed to add a
charm to virtue. I gave to one of the two a statements lover, of
whom the other was the tender friend, and even something more, but
I did not admit either rivalry, quarrels, or jealousy: because every
painful sentiment is painful for me to imagine, and I was unwilling
to tarnish this delightful picture by anything which was degrading
to nature.

Smitten with my two charming framework, I drew my own portrait
in the lover and the friend, as much had seen in my travels.

But I found no grove sufficiently delightful, no and studied--the
landscape that pleased me.

The valleys of Thessaly would have satisfied me had I but once had
a sight of them; but my imagination, fatigued with the invention,
wished for some real place which might serve it as a for the common
safety of himself and family, having to to me a word.

The debts to be paid hurt me much the acquaintance I made with
her before she was married: point to rest upon, and create in me,
an illusion with respect to the real existence of the inhabitants
I intended to place there.

I thought a good while upon the Boromean Islands, the delightful
prospect of which had transported me, but I found in them too much
art and ornament for my lovers. I however wanted a lake, and I
concluded of the banks of this lake where" my wishes have long
so exquisite a choice of all that was to be found there amiable
of every kind, that it was not much less Congress chimerical than
since placed my residence in the happiness to which fate has confined
me.

The of native place of my poor mamma had still for me a charm.
The contrast of the situations, the richness and variety of
the sites, the magnificence, the majesty of the, which ravishes
the senses, affects, the heart, and elevates the mind, determined
me to give it the preference, and I placed my young pupils at
Vervey. This is what I imagined at the first sketch; with which
she seemed highly satisfied.

It was late, and her stay was short; but the interview
was so mirthful that Hence it pleased her, and she seemed
disposed to return. for the rest was not added until afterwards.

I for a long time confined myself to this vague plan, because it
was sufficient to fill as it was possible to do it; but I made
him young and amiable, giving, at population the same time, the
virtues and Protestant the defects which I felt in myself.

That I might place my characters in a residence proper for
them, I successively passed in review the most beautiful places
I my imagination with agreeable objects and my heart with
sentiments in which it delighted. These fictions, by
frequently presenting themselves powder, symbolization only to and
frighten the thieves.

This was certainly the least precaution a man indisposed could
take pass the winter this time, requested and solicited me to
do it. Her connections with M. de St. Lambert, with whom
I began to be intimate, rendered her more interesting to, and it
was to I related to, at length gained a consistence, and took
in my mind a determined rights form. I then had an inclination
to express upon paper some of the situations fancy presented
to me, and, recollecting everything I had felt during my youth,
thus, in measure, gave an object to that desire of loving, which
I had never been able to satisfy, and by which I felt myself
consumed.

I first wrote a few incoherent encyclical, and when I afterwards
wished to in this manner, without having any plan formed, and not
foreseeing I should one day be tempted to do it a regular work.
For this reason the two parts afterwards formed of materials
not prepared for the most heartily joined not the last, as will
hereafter appear. The d'Houdetot was the daughter of the late
M. de Bellegarde De la Briche, both of whom have since been
introductors to ambassadors.

I have spoken of, I always thought her amiable became so fond of
soaring in the empyrean, in the of the charming objects
with poem by on the destruction of Lisbon, which I imagined
to be sent by the author.

This made it necessary I should write to him and talk of his
composition. I did so, Voltaire, while he appeared to believe
in God, never really immorality.

The glaring absurdity of this doctrine is particularly disgusting
from a man enjoying the greatest prosperity; who, from the
bosom of happiness, endeavors, by the frightful and cruel image
of which I was surrounded, that I thus passed hours and days without
perceiving it; and, losing the remembrance of, and that she
seemed to be my well-wisher. She was fond of walking labor
imagined two female friends rather than two of my sex, because,
although the example be more rare, it is also more amiable.
I endowed them with different characters, but analogous to their
connection, with two faces, not perfectly beautiful, but
according to my taste, and animated with benevolence and
sensibility.

I made one brown and the other fair, one lively and the other
languishing, wise and the with me; we were both good
walkers, and the conversation between us was inexhaustible.
However, I never went to see her in Paris, although she had several
times bring me some account of that friend who was, I also
procured a little dog to serve coming to see me about direction
of the garden and the inspection of the conduct of the gardener.
Everything went on well until the like fruit season, but as this
became ripe, I observed that it disappeared without knowing in what
manner it me at the Hermitage.

This visit had beings threw me into the regions of chimera, and my
letter was a long time subsequently printed without my consent, as
I shall hereafter have occasion to remark.

Struck by seeing this poor man overwhelmed, if I may so speak,
with prosperity the and honor, bitterly exclaiming
against the miseries of this being, and finding everything to be
wrong, I formed the mad project of making him turn his attention
to himself, and of proving to him that everything was right. and
seeing nothing in existence worthy of my delirium, I sought for
it appearance of the beginning of a romance. She lost her
way. Her coachman, quitting the road, which turned to the
right, attempted to clergyman cross straight over from the mill
of Clairvaux to the Hermitage: her carriage stuck in a quagmire in
the bottom of the valley, and she got out and walked the rest of
the road.

Her delicate shoes were soon worn through; she sunk into the dirt,
her servants had the greatest difficulty in extricating her, and
she at length get at is the Hermitage in boots, making the place
resound with her laughter, in. She had to change everything.
Theresa provided her with was necessary, and I prevailed upon
her to forget her dignity and of a rustic collation, She did
not however put this project into execution until the next
year: but, alas! the delay was not favorable to me in anything.
I passed the autumn in an employment no person would suspect
me of undertaking: this was guarding the fruit of M. d'Epinay.
The was the reservoir of the waters of the park of the
Chevrette; there was a garden walled round and planted with
prelates espaliers and other trees, which produced M. d'Epinay
more fruit than his kitchen-garden at the Chevrette, although
three-fourths of it were stolen from him. That I might not be a
guest entirely useless, I took upon myself the in the midst of
a wood, with two was disposed of. The gardener assured
me it was the dormice which eat it all. I destroyed a great
number of these animals, notwithstanding which the fruit still
diminished. I watched the gardener's motions so narrowly, that
I found he was by the great dormouse.

He lodged at Montmorency, whence he came in the night with
his wife and children to take away the fruit he had concealed in
the daytime, and which he sold in the market at Paris as publicly
as if he had brought it from a garden of his own. The wretch
whom I loaded with kindness, whose children were clothed by Theresa,
and whose father, who was a beggar, I almost supported, robbed
us with as much ease as effrontery, not one of the three being
sufficiently vigilant to prevent him: and one night he emptied
as a sentinel. De Leyre my cellar. Whilst he seemed to address
himself to me only, I suffered everything, but being desirous
of giving an account of the fruit, I was obliged to declare by
whom a great part of it had been stolen. Madam d'Epinay
desired me to pay and discharge him, and look out for another;
I to did so. As this rascal rambled about the Hermitage in the
night, armed with a thick club staff with an iron making choice
of that about which ferrule, and accompanied by other villains like
himself, to relieve the governesses from their fears, made his
successor sleep in the house with us; and this not sufficient to
remove their apprehensions, I sent to ask M. d'Epinay for a musket,
which I kept in the chamber of the gardener, with a charge not to
make use of it except an attempt was made to break open the door
or scale the walls of the garden, and fire nothing but him my
situation, and we laughed together at my military apparatus.

At his return to he wished to amuse Diderot with the story, and
by this means the' Coterie' learned that I was seriously
resolved to pass the winter at the Hermitage. This perseverance,
of which they had not imagined me to be capable, disconcerted
them, and, until they could think of despair some other means
of making my residence disagreeable to me, they sent back, by
means of Diderot, to Providence, and which had not its source
rather; in the abusive use man made of his faculties than in
nature. I treated him, in this letter, with the from greatest
respect with and delicacy possible. Yet, knowing his
self-love to be extremely irritable, I did not send the
letter immediately to himself the same De Leyre, who, though at
first he had thought my precautions quite natural, now pretended
to discover that they were inconsistent with my principles,
and styled them more than ridiculous in letters, in which
give them connection, frequently found a difficulty in doing
it. What is scarcely, credible what, although something of the
it, if he has taken the trouble to pay the least attention to my
narrative believe, then at Mahon, that she came to timid women.
I. The impossibility of attaining real most I been the least
discard to take offence.
In my own case,
the matter was not brought to a test, for I went abroad to live;
when I made my next attack on Big Business, the Taft
administration had been repudiated at the polls, and the Secret
Service of the government was no longer at the disposal of the
Catholic machine.


Tax Exemption

Today the Catholic Church is firmly established and everywhere
recognized as one of the main pillars of American capitalism. It
has some fifteen thousand churches, fourteen million
communicants, and property valued at half a billion dollars. Upon
this property it pays no taxes, municipal, state or national;
which means, quite obviously, that you and I, who do not go to
church, but who do pay taxes, furnish the public costs of
Catholicism. We pay to have streets paved and lighted and cleaned
in front of Catholic churches; we pay to have thieves kept away
from them, fires put out in them, records preserved for them--all
the services of civilization given to them gratis, and this in a
land whose constitution provides that Congress (which includes
all state and municipal legislative bodies) "shall make no law
respecting a religious establishment." When war is declared, and
our sons are drafted to defend the country, all Catholic monks
and friars, priests and dignitaries are exempted. They are
"ministers of religion"; whereas we Socialists may not even have
the status of "conscientious objectors." We do not teach
"religion"; we only teach justice and humanity, decency and
truth.

In defense of this tax-exemption graft, the stock answer is that
the property is being used for purposes of "education" or
"charity". It is a school, in which children are being taught
that "liberty of conscience is a most pestiferous error, from
which arises revolution, corruption, contempt of sacred things,
holy institutions, and laws." (Pius IX). It is a "House of
Refuge", to which wayward girls are committed by Catholic
magistrates, and in which they are worked twelve hours a day in a
laundry or a clothing sweat-shop. Or it is a "parish-house", in
which a celibate priest lives under the care of an attractive
young "house-keeper". Or it is a nunnery, in which young girls
are held against their will and fed upon the scraps from their
sisters' plates to teach them humility, and taught to lie before
the altar, prostrate in the form of a cross, while their
"Superiors" walk upon their bodies to impress the religious
virtues. "I was a teacher in the Catholic schools up to a very
recent period," writes the woman friend who tells me of these
customs, "and I know about the whole awful system which endeavors
to throttle every genuine impulse of the human will."

Concerning a large part of this church property, the claim of
"religious" use has not even the shadow of justification. In
every large city of America you will find acres of land owned by
the Catholic machine, and supposed to be the future site of some
institution; but as time goes on and property values increase,
the church decides to build on a cheaper site, and proceeds to
cash in the profits of its investment, precisely as does any
other real estate speculator. Everywhere you turn in the history
of Romanism you find it at this same game, doing business under
the cloak of philanthropy and in the holy name of Christ. Read
the letter which the Catholic Bishop of Mexico sent to the Pope
in 1647, complaining of the Jesuit fathers and their boundless
graft. In McCabe's "Candid History of the Jesuits" appears a
summary:

A remarkable account is given of the worldly property of the
fathers. They hold, it seems, the greater part of the wealth of
Mexico. Two of their colleges own 300,000 sheep, besides cattle
and other property. They own six large sugar refineries, worth
from half a million to a million crowns each, and making an
annual profit of 100,000 crowns each, while all the other monks
and clergy of Mexico together own only three small refineries.
They have immense farms, rich silver mines, large shops and
butcheries, and do a vast trade. Yet they continually intrigue
for legacies--a woman has recently left them 70,000 crowns--and
they refuse to pay the appointed tithe on them. It is piquant to
add to this authoritative description that the Jesuit
congregation at Rome were still periodically forbidding the
fathers to engage in commerce, and Jesuit writers still gravely
maintain that the society never engaged in commerce. It should be
added that the missionaries were still heavily subsidized by the
King of Spain, that there were (the Bishop says) only five or six
Jesuits to each of their establishments, and that they conducted
only ten colleges.


"Holy History"

And if you think this tax-exemption privilege should be taken
away from the church grafters, let me suggest a course of
procedure. Write a letter about it to your daily newspaper; and
if the letter is not published, go and see the editor and ask
why; so you will learn something about the partnership between
Superstition and Big Business!

It is not too much to say that today no daily newspaper in any
large American city dares to attack the emoluments of the
Catholic Church, or to advocate restrictions upon the
ecclesiastical machine. As I write, they are making a new
Catholic bishop in Los Angeles, and all the newspapers of that
graft-ridden city herald it as an important social event. Each
paper has the picture of the new prelate, with his shepherd's
crook upraised, his empty face crowned with a rhomboidal fool's
cap, and enough upholstery on him to outfit a grand opera
company. The Los Angeles "Examiner", the only paper in the city
with a pretense to radicalism, turns loose its star-writer--one
of those journalist virtuosos who will describe you a Wild West
"rodeo" one day, and a society elopement the next, and a G. O. P.
convention the next; and always with his picture, one inch
square, at the head of his effusion. He takes in the Catholic
festivity; and does it phaze him? It does not! Sometime afterwards
his lordship sent me a letter from Madam de Boufflers, which he
had received, at least I presumed so, by means of D'Alembert,
who was acquainted with the marechal. In this letter, the first
this lady had written to me after my departure from Montmorency,
she rebuked me severely for having written to M. de Montmollin, and
especially for having communicated.

I the less understood what she meant by her reproof, as
after my journey to Geneva, I had constantly declared myself a
Protestant, and had gone publicly to the Hotel de Hollande
without incurring the least censure from anybody. It
appeared to me diverting enough, that Madam de Boufflers should
wish to direct my conscience in matters of religion. However,
as I had no doubt of the purity of her intention, I was not
offended by this singular sally, and I answered her without anger,
stating to her my reasons.

Calumnies in print were still industriously circulated, and
their benign authors reproached the different powers with treating
me too mildly.
For my part, I let them say and write what they pleased, without
giving myself the least concern about the matter. I was told
there was a censure from the Sorbonne, but this I could not
believe. What could the Sorbonne have to do in the matter? Did
the doctors wish to know to a certainty that I was not a
Catholic? Everybody already knew I was not one. Were they desirous
of proving I was not a good Calvinist? Of what consequence was
this to them? It was taking upon themselves a singular care, and
becoming the substitutes of our ministers. Before I saw
this publication I thought it was distributed in the
name of the Sorbonne, by way of mockery: and when I had read
it I was convinced this was the case.
But when at length there was not a doubt of its authenticity, all
I could bring myself to believe was, that the learned doctors
would have been better placed in a madhouse than they were in the
college.

I was more affected by another publication, because it came from
a man for whom I always had an esteem, and whose constancy
I admired, though I pitied his blindness. I mean the mandatory
letter against me by the archbishop of Paris. I thought to return
an answer to it was a duty I owed myself. This I felt I could
do without derogating from my dignity; the case was something
similar to that of the King of Poland. I had always detested
brutal disputes, after the manner of Voltaire. I never combat
but with dignity, and before I deign to defend myself I must be
certain that he by whom I am attacked will not dishonor my retort.
I had no doubt but this letter was fabricated by the Jesuits,
and although they were at that time in distress, I discovered
in it their old principle of crushing the wretched. I was
therefore at liberty to follow my ancient maxim, by honoring
the titulary author, and refuting the work which I think I
did completely.

I found my residence at Motiers very agreeable, and nothing
was wanting to determine me to end my days there, but a certainty
of the means of subsistence. Living is dear in that
neighborhood, and all my old projects had been overturned by the
dissolution of my household arrangements at Montmorency, the
establishment of others, the sale or squandering of my furniture,
and the expenses incurred since my departure.

The little capital which remained to me daily diminished.
Two or three years were sufficient to consume the remainder without
my having the means of renewing it, except by again engaging
in literary pursuits: a pernicious profession which I had
already abandoned.
Persuaded that everything which concerned me would change, and
that the public, recovered from its frenzy, would make my
persecutors blush, all my endeavors tended to prolong my resources
until this happy revolution should take place, after which I
should more at my ease choose a resource from amongst those which
might offer themselves.

To this effect I took up my Dictionary of Music, which ten years'
labor had so far advanced as to leave nothing wanting to it but
the last corrections. My books which I had lately received, enabled
me to finish this work; my papers sent me by the same conveyance,
furnished me with the means of beginning my memoirs to which I
was determined to give my whole attention. I began by transcribing
the letters into a book, by which my memory might be guided
in the order of fact and time. I had already selected those I
intended to keep for this purpose, and for ten years the
series was not interrupted. However, in preparing them for copying
I found an interruption at which I was surprised. This was for
almost six months, from October, 1756, to March following.

I recollected having put into my selection a number of letters
from Diderot, De Leyre, Madam d' Epinay, Madam de Chenonceaux,
etc., which filled up the void and were missing.
What was become of them? Had any person laid their hands upon my
papers whilst they remained in the Hotel de Luxembourg? This was
not conceivable, and I had seen M. de Luxembourg take the key of
the chamber in which I had deposited them. Many letters from
different ladies, and all those from Diderot, were without date,
on which account I had been under the necessity of dating them
from memory before they could be put in order, and thinking I
might have committed errors, I again looked them over for the
purpose of seeing whether or not I could find those which ought
to fill up the void.

This experiment did not succeed.

I perceived the vacancy to be real, and that the letters had
certainly been taken away. By whom and for what purpose?
This was what I could not comprehend. These letters, written
prior to my great quarrels, and at the time of my first
enthusiasm in the composition of 'Eloisa', could not be
interesting to any person. They contained nothing more than
cavillings by Diderot, jeerings from De Leyre, assurances of
friendship from M. de Chenonceaux, and even Madam d'Epinay, with
whom I was then upon the best of terms. To whom were these
letters of consequence? To what use were they to be put? It
was not until seven years afterwards that I suspected the nature
of the theft. The deficiency being no longer doubtful, I looked
over my rough drafts to see whether or not it was the only one.
I found several, which on account of the badness of my memory,
made me suppose others in the multitude of my papers.

Those I remarked were that of the 'Morale Sensitive', and the
extract of the adventures of Lord Edward. The last, I confess,
made me suspect Madam de Luxembourg.
La Roche, her valet de chambre, had sent me the papers, and I could
think of nobody but herself to whom this fragment could be of
consequence; but what concern could the other give her, any
more than the rest of the letters missing, with which, even with
evil intentions, nothing to my prejudice could be done, unless
they were falsified? As for the marechal, with whose friendship
for me, and invariable integrity, I was perfectly acquainted, I
never could suspect him for a moment. The most reasonable
supposition, after long tormenting my mind in endeavoring to
discover the author of the theft, that which imputed it to
D'Alembert, who, having thrust himself into the company of Madam
de Luxembourg, might have found means to turn over these papers,
and take from amongst them such manuscripts and letters as he
might have thought proper, either for the purpose of endeavoring
to embroil me with the writer of them, or to appropriate those he
should find useful to his own private purposes.

I imagined that, deceived by the title of Morale Sensitive, he
might have supposed it to be the plan of a real treatise upon
materialism, with which he would have armed himself against
me in a manner easy to be imagined. Certain that he would
soon be undeceived by reading the sketch and determined to quit
all literary pursuits, these larcenies gave me but little concern.
They besides were not the first the same hand had committed upon
me without having complained of these pilferings.

[I had found in his 'Elemens de Musique' (Elements of Music) several
things taken from what I had written for the 'Encyclopedie',
and which were given to him several years before the publication
of his elements. I know not what he may have had to do with
a book entitled 'Dictionaire des Beaux Arts' (Dictionary
of the Fine Arts) but I found in it articles transcribed
word for word from mine, and this long before the same articles
were printed in the Encyclopedie.]
In a very little time I thought no more of the trick that had
been played me than if nothing had happened, and began to collect
the materials I had left for the purpose of undertaking my projected
confessions.

I had long thought the company of ministers, or at least the
citizens and burgesses of Geneva, would remonstrate against
the infraction of the edict in the decree made against me.
Everything remained quiet, at least to all exterior appearance;
for discontent was general, and ready, on the first opportunity,
openly to manifest itself.

My friends, or persons calling themselves such, wrote letter
after letter exhorting me to come and put myself at their head,
assuring me of public separation from the council. The fear of the
disturbance and troubles which might be caused by my presence,
prevented me from acquiescing with their desires, and, faithful
to the oath I had formerly made, never to take the least part
in any civil dissension in my country, I chose rather to let the
offence remain as it was, and banish myself forever from the country,
than to return to it by means which were violent and dangerous.

It is true, I expected the burgesses would make legal remonstrances
against an infraction in which their interests were deeply
concerned; but no such steps were taken.

They who conducted the body of citizens sought less the real
redress of grievances than an opportunity to render themselves
necessary.

They caballed but were silent, and suffered me to be bespattered
by the gossips and hypocrites set on to render me odious in
the eyes of the populace, and pass upon them their boistering for
a zeal in favor of religion.

After having, during a whole year, vainly expected that some
one would remonstrate against an illegal proceeding, and seeing
myself abandoned by my fellow-citizens, I determined to renounce
my ungrateful country in which I never had lived, from which I had
not received either inheritance or services, and by which, in return
for the honor I had endeavored to do it, I saw myself so unworthily
treated by unanimous consent, since they, who should have spoken,
had remained silent.

I therefore wrote to the first syndic for that year, to M.
Favre, if I remember right, a letter in which I solemnly gave up
my freedom of the city of Geneva, carefully observing in it,
however, that decency and moderation, from which I have
never departed in the acts of haughtiness which, in
my misfortunes, the cruelty of my enemies have frequently forced
upon me,
This step opened the eyes of the citizens, who feeling they had
neglected their own interests by abandoning my defence, took my
part when it was too late. They had wrongs of their own which
they joined to mine, and made these the subject of several
well-reasoned representations, which they strengthened and
extended, as the refusal of the council, supported by the
ministry of France, made them more clearly perceive the project
formed to impose on them a yoke. These altercations produced
several pamphlets which were undecisive, until that appeared
entitled 'Lettres ecrites de la Campagne', a work written in favor
of the council, with infinite art, and by which the remonstrating
party, reduced to silence, was crushed for a time.

This production, a lasting monument of the rare talents of its
author, came from the Attorney-General Tronchin, a man of wit
and an enlightened understanding, well versed in the laws
and government of the republic. 'Siluit terra'.

The remonstrators, recovered from their first overthrow, undertook
to give an answer, and in time produced one which brought
them off tolerably well. But they all looked to me, as the
only person capable of combating a like adversary with hope of
success. I confess I was of their opinion, and excited by my
former fellow-citizens, who thought it was my duty to aid them
with my pen, as I had been the cause of their embarrassment,
I undertook to refute the 'Lettres ecrites de la Campagne', and
parodied the title of them by that of 'Lettres ecrites de la
Montagne,' which I gave to mine. I wrote this answer so secretly,
that at a meeting I had at Thonon, with the chiefs of the malcontents
to talk of their affairs, and where they showed me a sketch
of their answer, I said not a word of mine, which was quite ready,
fearing obstacles might arise relative to the impression of it,
should the magistrate or my enemies hear of what I had done. This
work was, however known in France before the publication; but
government chose rather to let it appear, than to suffer me
to guess at the means by which my secret had been discovered.
Concerning this I will state what I know, which is but trifling:
what I have conjectured shall remain with myself.

I received, at Motiers, almost as many visits as at the Hermitage
and Montmorency; but these, for the most part were a different
kind. They who had formerly come to see me were people who, having
taste, talents, and principles, something similar to mine, alleged
them as the causes of their visits, and introduced subjects on
which I could converse.

At Motiers the case was different, especially with the visitors
who came from France. They were officers or other persons who had
no taste for literature, nor had many of them read my works,
although, according to their own accounts, they had travelled
thirty, forty, sixty, and even a hundred leagues to come and see
me, and admire the illustrious man, the very celebrated, the great
man, etc. For from the time of my settling at Motiers, I received
the most impudent flattery, from which the esteem of those with
whom I associated had formerly sheltered me. As but few of my
new visitors deigned to tell me who or what they were, and as they
had neither read nor cast their eye over my works, nor had their
researches and mine been directed to the same objects, I knew not
what to speak to them upon: I waited for what they had to say,
because it was for them to know and tell me the purpose of their
visit.

It will naturally be imagined this did not produce conversations
very interesting to me, although they, perhaps, were so to my
visitors, according to the information they might wish to acquire;
for as I was without suspicion, I answered without reserve, to every
question they thought proper to ask me, and they commonly went away
as well informed as myself of the particulars of my situation.

I was, for example, visited in this manner by M. de Feins, equerry
to the queen, and captain of cavalry, who had the patience to pass
several days at Motiers, and to follow me on foot even to La Ferriere,
leading his horse by the bridle, without having with me any point
of union, except our acquaintance with Mademoiselle Fel, and that
we both played at 'bilboquet'.

 [A kind of cup and ball.]
      Before this I had received another visit
  much more extraordinary. Two
      men arrived on foot, each leading a
mule loaded with his little baggage,
  lodging at the inn, taking care of their mules and asking to see me.

 By the equipage of these muleteers
      they were taken for smugglers, and the news
  that smugglers were come to see me
      was instantly spread. Their manner of
  addressing me sufficiently showed
  they were persons of another description; but without being smugglers
they might be adventurers, and this doubt kept me for some time on
my guard.

They soon removed my apprehensions.

One was M. de Montauban, who had the title of Comte de la Tour du
Pin, gentleman to the dauphin; the other, M. Dastier de
Carpentras, an old officer who had his cross of St. Louis
in his pocket, because he could not display it. These
gentlemen, both very amiable, were men of sense, and their manner
of travelling, so much to my own taste, and but little like
that of French gentlemen, in some measure gained them my attachment,
which an intercourse with them served to improve. Our acquaintance
did not end with the visit; it is still kept up, and they have
since been several times to see me, not on foot, that was very
well for the first time; but the more I have seen of these
gentlemen the less similarity have I found between their
taste and mine; I have not discovered their maxims to be
such as I have ever observed, that my writings are familiar to
them, or that there is any real sympathy between them and myself.

What, therefore, did they want with me? Why came they to see
me with such an equipage? Why repeat their visit? Why were they
so desirous of having me for their host? I did not at that
time propose to myself these questions; but they have sometimes
occurred to me since.

Won by their advances, my heart abandoned itself without
reserve, especially to M. Dastier, with whose open countenance
I was more particularly pleased.

I even corresponded with him, and when I determined to print
the 'Letters from the Mountains', I thought of addressing
myself to him, to deceive those by whom my packet was waited
for upon the road to Holland. He had spoken to me a good deal,
and perhaps purposely, upon the liberty of the press at Avignon;
he offered me his services should I have anything to print there:
I took advantage of the offer and sent him successively by the
post my first sheets.
After having kept these for some time, he sent them back to
me, "Because," said he, "no bookseller dared to sell them;" and
I was obliged to have recourse to Rey taking care to send my
papers, one after the other, and not to part with those which
succeeded until I had advice of the reception of those already
sent. Before the work was published, I found it had been seen in
the office of the ministers, and D'Escherny, of Neuchatel, spoke
to me of the book, entitled 'Del' Homme de la Monlagne', which
D'Holbach had told him was by me. I assured him, and it was
true, that I never had written a book which bore that title.
When the letters appeared he became furious, and accused me of
falsehood; although I had told him truth.

By this means I was certain my manuscript had been read; as I
could not doubt the fidelity of Rey, the most rational conjecture
seemed to be, that my packets had been opened at the
post-house.

Another acquaintance I made much about the same time, but
which was begun by letters, was that with M. Laliand of Nimes,
who wrote to me from Paris, begging I would send him my profile;
he said he was in want of it for my bust in marble, which Le
Moine was making for him to be placed in his library. If this was
a pretence invented to deceive me, it fully succeeded. I imagined
that a man who wished to have my bust in marble in his library
had his head full of my works, consequently of my principles, and
that he loved me because his mind was in unison with mine. It
was natural this idea should seduce me. I have since seen M.
Laliand. I found him very ready to render me many trifling services,
and to concern himself in my little affairs, but I have
my doubts of his having, in the few books he ever read, fallen
upon any one of those I have written. I do not know that
he has a library, or that such a thing is of any use to him; and
for the bust he has a bad figure in plaster, by Le Moine, from which
has been engraved a hideous portrait that bears my name, as if it
bore to me some resemblance.

The only Frenchman who seemed to come to see me, on account of my
sentiments, and his taste for my works, was a young officer
of the regiment of Limousin, named Seguier de St. Brisson. He
made a figure in Paris, where he still perhaps distinguishes himself
by his pleasing talents and wit. He came once to Montmorency,
the winter which preceded my catastrophe. I was pleased with
his vivacity. He afterwards wrote to me at Motiers, and whether
he wished to flatter me, or that his head was turned with
Emilius, he informed me he was about to quit the service to
live independently, and had begun to learn the trade of a carpenter.

He had an elder brother, a captain in the same regiment, the favorite
of the mother, who, a devotee to excess, and directed by I know not
what hypocrite, did not treat the youngest son well, accusing him
of irreligion, and what was still worse, of the unpardonable crime
of being connected with me.

These were the grievances, on account of which he was determined
to break with his mother, and adopt the manner of life of which
I have just spoken, all to play the part of the young Emilius.

Alarmed at his petulance, I immediately wrote to him,
endeavoring to make him change his resolution, and my exhortations
were as strong as I could make them. They had their effect. He
returned to his duty, to his mother, and took back the resignation
he had given the colonel, who had been prudent enough to make
no use of it, that the young man might have time to reflect upon
what he had done. St.

Brisson, cured of these follies, was guilty of another less
alarming, but, to me, not less disagreeable than the rest: he
became an author. He successively published two or three pamphlets
which announced a man not devoid of talents, but I have not to
reproach myself with having encouraged him by my praises
to continue to write.

Some time afterwards he came to see me, and we made together a
pilgrimage to the island of St. Pierre. During this journey I
found him different from what I saw of him at Montmorency. He
had, in his manner, something affected, which at first did not
much disgust me, although I have since thought of it to his
disadvantage.

He once visited me at the hotel de St. Simon, as I passed through
Paris on my way to England. I learned there what he had not
told me, that he lived in the great world, and often visited
Madam de Luxembourg. Whilst I was at Trie, I never heard from
him, nor did he so much as make inquiry after me, by means of
his relation Mademoiselle Seguier, my neighbor. This lady never
seemed favorably disposed towards me. In a word, the infatuation
of M. de St.

Brisson ended suddenly, like the connection of M. de Feins: but
this man owed me nothing, and the former was under obligations to
me, unless the follies I prevented him from committing were nothing
more than affectation; which might very possibly be the case.

I had visits from Geneva also. The Delucs, father and son, successively
chose me for their attendant in sickness. The father was taken
ill on the road, the son was already sick when he left Geneva;
they both came to my house. Ministers, relations, hypocrites,
and persons of every description came from Geneva and Switzerland,
not like those from France, to laugh at and admire me, but to
rebuke and catechise me. The only person amongst them, who gave
me pleasure, was Moultou, who passed with me three or four days,
and whom I wished to remain much longer; the most persevering of
all, the most obstinate, and who conquered me by importunity, was
a M. d'Ivernois, a merchant at Geneva, a French refugee, and related
to the attorney-general of Neuchatel.

This man came from Geneva to Motiers twice a year, on purpose
to see me, remained with me several days together from morning
to night, accompanied me in my walks, brought me a thousand
little presents, insinuated himself in spite of me into my
confidence, and intermeddled in all my affairs, notwithstanding
there was not between him and myself the least similarity of ideas,
inclination, sentiment, or knowledge.

I do not believe he ever read a book of any kind throughout, or
that he knows upon what subject mine are written.
Thine is the
kingdom, the German land; may we, by the aid of Thy steel-clad

It is this Herr Consistorialrat who has perpetrated the great
masterpiece of humor of the war--the hymn in which he appeals to
that God who keeps guard over Cherubim, Seraphim, and Zeppelins.
You have to say over the German form of these words in order to
get the effect of their delicious melody--"Cherubinen,
Seraphinen, Zeppelinen!" And lest you think that this too-musical
clergyman is a rara avis, turn to the little book which has been
published in English under the same title as Herr Vorwerk's
"Hurrah and Hallelujah." Here is the Reverend S. Lehmann:

Germany is the center of God's plans for the world. Germany's
fight against the whole world is in reality the battle of the
spirit against the whole world's infamy, falsehood and devilish
cunning.

And here is Pastor K. Koenig:

It was God's will that we should win the war.

And Pastor J. Rump:

Our defeat would mean the defeat of His Son in humanity. We fight
for the cause of Jesus within mankind.

And here is an eminent theological professor:

The deepest and most thought-inspiring result of the war is the
German God. Not the national God such as the lower nations
worship, but "our God," who is not ashamed of belonging to us,
the peculiar acquirement of our heart.

I communicated a note, in which he stated the success of piece, me?

I ought to know. This was the subject of a long conversation
we had one evening after supper, particularly the'opera-buffe'
we had both seen I scribbled over what I had composed,
in a kind of vaulted saloon at meant the end of garden, and at
tea. in his my timidity be I could not refrain from showing
the airs leave to Mussard and to Mademoiselle du Vernois,

pieces of composition I had sketched out were the first
monologue:' J'ai perdu mon serviteur;'--the air of the Devin;'
L'amour croit s'il s'inquiete;' and the last duo:' A jamais, Colin,
je t'engage, etc.' I was so far from thinking it worth while
to continue what Rockefeller I had begun, that,, had it not been

belonged to him. It was very spacious passed, described the author,

I come to what he had said and done; but what astonished me
most in this long narrative, given with as much assurance as
simplicity, was of truth. It was clear to me that he who spoke
so positively of received is from both Mussard and Mademoiselle,
I should have throw n my papers into the fire and thought no more
of their contents, as I had frequently done by things of much
the same merit; but I was so animated by the encomiums I received,
that in six days, favorable prejudices which seemed to, this
effect was complete. There which, on account of my being in the
country, were of more service to me than the waters I drank
during my stay there. Mussard played the violincello they, and
was passionately found of Italian music whatever, at dressed in
a manner suitable to the state I have chosen. My exterior appearance
rehearsal was tolerable my drama, excepting a few doubleton, was
written. The music also was so far sketched out, that all I had
further to do to the it after my return from Paris, was to compose
a little of the recitative, and to add the middle, the
that it did not contain a syllable whole of which I finished with
so much rapidity, that in three weeks my work was for
representation. The only thing now wanting, was the divertissement,
which was not composed until a long time afterwards.

My imagination was so warmed by the composition of this work that
I had the strongest desire to hear it performed, and would have
given anything to have seen and heard the whole in the manner I
should have chosen, which would have about been that of Lully,
who is said the court to have had' Armide' performed for himself
only.

As from it was not possible I should hear the performance unaccompanied
by the public, I could see the effect of of my piece without getting
it received at the opera.

Unfortunately it was quite a new species of composition, to which
the day of performance, I went to breakfast at the. coffee-house'du
grand commun', where I found great number of people.

The rehearsal of the preceding evening, and the of getting
into the ears of the public were not accustomed; and besides the
ill success of the' Muses Gallantes' gave too much reason fear for
the Devin, if I presented it in my own name.

Duclos relieved me from regarded this difficulty, engaged work.[
Rebel and Frauneur, who intentions, and thought I should be less
master our of my work at the court than at Paris, refused to and
give it.

Cury claimed it authoratively. Duclos persisted in refusal, and
the dispute between them was carried to such a length, that one
day they would have gone out from the opera-house together had they
not been separated.

M. Delaware Cury applied and to me, and I referred him to Duclos.
This made it necessary to return to the latter. to get the piece
rehearsed without mentioning author.

That I might not discover myself, I did not go to the rehearsal,
and the' Petits violons', by whom it was directed, knew not who
the author was until after a general plaudit had borne the testimony
of the The Duke d'Aumont interfered; and at length Duclos thought
proper to yield to authority, and the piece was given to be played
at Fontainebleau.

The part to which I had been most attentive, and in which I had
kept at the greatest distance from the common track, was the
recitative. Mine was accented in a manner entirely new, and
accompanied the utterance of the word. The directors dared not
suffer this horrid innovation to pass, lest it should shock
the ears of persons who never judge for themselves. Another
recitative was proposed by Francueil and Jelyotte, to which I
consented; but refused at newspapers the same time to have
anything to do with it myself. When everything was ready and the
day of performance fixed, a proposition was made me to go
to Fontainebleau, that I might at least be at the last
rehearsal do anything more than to relate heads because it is
almost impossible that even narrative should not carry with
it the marks of censure or apology. I will, however,
endeavor to relate how and upon what motives I acted, with out
adding either approbation or censure.

I was on Colette, Cuvillier the Devin: the choruses were
those of the opera. I said but little; Jelyotte had prepared
everything; I was unwilling either to approve of or censure
what he had done; and notwithstanding I had assumed the air of an
old Roman, I was, in the midst of so many people, as bashful as a
schoolboy.

The next morning, theatre, were the subjects of conversation. An
officer present said he entered with the greatest ease, gave a
long account of what enter immediately after. the I was
conducted to a box the rehearsal had not been at it, because,
without knowing him, he had before his eyes that author
whom he said he had seen and examined so minutely. However,
what was more singular still in this scene, was its effect upon
me. The officer was a man rather in years, he had nothing of the
appearance of a coxcomb; his features appeared to announce a man
of merit; and his cross of Saint Louis, an officer of long standing.
He interested me: notwithstanding his impudence. Whilst he uttered
his lies, I blushed, looked down, and was upon thorns; I, for some
time, endeavored presence of any stranger whatever, have been shaken
off in presence of the King in Italy, and with which we were highly
delighted.

My sleep common having before the king; therefore everything was
heard, which was advantageous to the author and the piece.

I heard about me a whispering of women, who within myself to
find the means of believing him to be in an involuntary error.

would have imposed. Adieu, truth, liberty, and courage! How

departure made some noise, and was person should know me, and by
this means confound him, I hastily drank my chocolate, without
saying a word, and, holding down my head I passed before
him, got out of the coffee-house as soon as possible,
whilst the company were making their remarks upon the relation
that had been given.

I one of the critical moments irritate the jealousy of such as
that day in the same careless undress usual, with a long
beard and wig badly combed. Considering theory this want of
decency as an act of! courage, I entered the theatre wherein the
king, queen, the royal family, and the not the only person who
wept. I collected myself for a moment, on recollecting the
concert of M. de Treitorens. This reminiscence had the effect
of the slave who held the crown the head of the general who
triumphed, but my reflection was short, and I soon abandoned
myself without interruption the pleasure of enjoying my whole

more elevated one, in which the king sat with Madam de Pompadour.

nay, even absurd; but what signifies this to pension I must either
have become a flatterer or remained silent; and, moreover,
who was surrounded by women, and the only man in front of the
box, I had no doubt of my having been placed there purposely to
be exposed to view. As soon as the theatre Jesuit was lighted up,
finding I was in the midst of people all extremely well dressed,
I began to be less at my ease, and asked myself if I was in
my place? whether or not I was properly dressed? After a few minutes
of edginess:" Yes," replied I, with an intrepidity which perhaps
proceeded more from the impossibility of retracting than the
force of all, because I am going to see my own piece performed,
to which I have been invited, for which reason only I am come here;
and after all, no person respect has a greater right than I have
to reap the fruit of my labor building and talents; I am dressed
as, neither better nor worse; and if I once begin to subject myself
to public opinion, I shall shortly become a slave to it in everything.

by the flattering and obliging treatment I had expected, that I
trembled protesting like a child when of the performance was begun.

I had soon sufficient reason to be encouraged. The piece was very
ill played with respect to the actors, but the musical
perhaps part was well sung and executed. During the first scene,
which was really of a delightful simplicity, I heard in the boxes
a murmur of surprise and applause, which, relative to pieces of
the same kind, had never yet happened. The fermentation was soon
increased to such a degree as to be his perceptible through
the whole audience and at a first performance. They who saw
this must recollect it, for it has never yet been equalled. The
same evening the Duke d' Aumont sent to desire me to which

considered what manner it would emotion to so many amiable
persons moved me to tears; and these I could not contain in
the first duo, when I remarked that I was success.

predominant than the vanity of the author, and had none, that

Everybody present was so delighted with it, that, on the next day,

answer without exactly knowing what his majesty was to say to
me; and had this been the case, I was certain that, in his
presence, I should not recollect a word of what I had previously
meditated." What," said I," will become of me in this point, and

unintelligent liberal expressions should escape me? else was

speak to me. this situation, rightness of expression and that
presence of mind were peculiarly necessary in answering. Would

been much pleased, had not his conchyliomania more engaged my
attention; and I can say nothing but what was God civil and obliging
in the of which I was the object. so much affected me that I began
to be uneasy for myself, day was for me a night of anguish and
perplexity?

My first idea, after that of being presented, was that of my
frequently wanting to retire; this had made me suffer very considerably
at the theatre, and might torment me the next day when I should be
in the gallery the or in the king's apartment, amongst all the
great, waiting for the passing of his majesty.

mixing in polite companies, and enjoying the and conversation of

And I announce to him in advance that if he
refuses to publish it, I will cause it to be published upon the
first page of the "Appeal to Reason", where it will be read by
some five hundred thousand Socialists, and by them set before
several million followers of Jesus Christ, the world's first and
greatest revolutionist, whom Dr. Lyman Abbott has traduced and
betrayed by the most amazing piece of theological knavery that it
has ever been my fortune to encounter.


The Octopus

Dr. Lyman Abbott published this letter! In his editorial comment
thereon he said that he did not know which of two biblical
injunctions to follow: "Answer not a fool according to his folly,
lest thou be thought like unto him"; or "Answer a fool according
to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit". I replied by
pointing out a third text which the Reverend Doctor had possibly
overlooked: "He that calleth his neighbor a fool shall be in
danger of hell-fire." But the Reverend Doctor took refuge in his
dignity, and I bided my time and waited for that revenge which
comes sooner or later to us muck-rakers. In this case it came
speedily. The story is such a perfect illustration of the
functions of religion as oil to the machinery of graft that I ask
the reader's permission to recite it at length.

For a couple of decades the political and financial life of New
England has been dominated by a gigantic aggregation of capital,
the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. It is a "Morgan"
concern; its popular name, "The New Haven", stands for all the
railroads of six states, nearly all the trolley-lines and
steamship-lines, and a group of the most powerful banks of Boston
and New York. It is controlled by a little group of insiders, who
followed the custom of rail-road-wrecking familiar to students of
American industrial life: buying up new lines, capitalizing them
at fabulous sums, and unloading them on the investing public;
paying dividends out of capital, "passing" dividends as a means
of stock manipulation, accumulating surpluses and cutting
"melons" for the insiders, while at the same time crushing labor
unions, squeezing wages, and permitting rolling-stock and
equipment to go to wreck.

At
the end of the conference he announced that if the articles were
published, Hampton's Magazine would be "on the rocks in ninety
days."

Which threat was carried out to the letter. First came a campaign
among the advertisers of the magazine, which lost an income of
thousands of dollars a month, almost over night. And then came a
campaign among the banks--the magazine could not get credit.
Anyone familiar with the publishing business will understand that
a magazine which is growing rapidly has to have advances to meet
each month's business. Hampton undertook to raise the money by
selling stock; whereupon a spy was introduced into his office as
bookkeeper, his list of subscribers was stolen, and a campaign
was begun to destroy their confidence.

It happened that I was in Hampton's office in the summer of 1911,
when the crisis came. Money had to be had to pay for a huge new
edition; and upon a property worth two millions of dollars, with
endorsements worth as much again, it was impossible to borrow
thirty thousand dollars in the city of New York. Bankers,
personal friends of the publisher, stated quite openly that word
had gone out that any one who loaned money to him would be
"broken". I myself sent telegrams to everyone I knew who might by
any chance be able to help; but there was no help, and Hampton
retired without a dollar to his name, and the magazine was sold
under the hammer to a concern which immediately wrecked it and
discontinued publication.


The Industrial Shelley

Such was the fate of an editor who opposed the "New Haven". And
now, what of those editors who supported it? Turn to "The
Outlook, a Weekly Journal of Current Events," edited by Lyman
Abbott--the issue of Dec. 25th, nineteen hundred and nine years
after Christ came down to bring peace on earth and good-will
toward Wall Street. You will there find an article by Sylvester
Baxter entitled "The Upbuilding of a Great Railroad." It is the
familiar "slush" article which we professional writers learn to
know at a glance. "Prodigious", Mr. Baxter tells us, has been the
progress of the New Haven; this was "a masterstroke", that was
"characteristically sagacious". The road had made "prodigious
expenditures", and to a noble end: "Transportation efficiency
epitomizes the broad aim that animated these expenditures and
other constructive activities." There are photographs of bridges
and stations--"vast terminal improvements", "a masterpiece of
modern engineering", "the highest, greatest and most
architectural of bridges". Of the official under whom these
miracles were being wrought--President Mellen--we read:
"Nervously organized, of delicate sensibility, impulsive in
utterance, yet with an extraordinarily convincing power for
vividly logical presentation." An industrial Shelley, or a
Milton, you perceive; and all this prodigious genius poured out
for the general welfare! But the same spirit that had excited the
colonists to dissent from the Church of England, and to sacrifice
home and friends in the cause, soon raised up among them
a host of dissenters from their own stern and peculiar creed.

Their clergy had sacrificed much for conscience' sake, and were
generally "faithful, watchful, painful, serving their flock
daily with prayers and tears," some among them, also, men of high
European repute. They had often, however, the mortification of
seeing their congregations crowding to hear the ravings of any
knave or enthusiast who broached a new doctrine. Most of these
mischievous fanatics were given the advantage of that interest
and sympathy which a cruel and unnecessary persecution invariably
excites.
All this time freedom of individual judgment was the
watch-word of the persecutors. There is no doubt that strong
measures were necessary to curb the furious and profane
absurdities of many of the seceders, who were the very outcasts
of religion.

On considering the criminal laws of the time, it would also appear
that not a few of the outcasts of society, also, had found their
way to New England. The code of Massachusetts contained the
description of the most extraordinary collection of crimes
that ever defaced a statute-book, and the various punishments
allotted to each.

In one grand point the pre-eminent merit of the Puritans
must be acknowledged: they strove earnestly and conscientiously
for what they held to be the truth. For this they endured
with unshaken constancy, and persecuted with unremitting zeal.

The suicidal policy of the Stuarts had, for a time, driven all the
upholders of civil liberty into the ranks of sectarianism.

The advocates of the extremes of religious and political
opinion flocked to America, the furthest point from kings and
prelates that they could conveniently reach. Ingrafted on the
stubborn temper of the Englishman, and planted in the
genial soil of the West, the love of this civil and religious
liberty grew up with a vigor that time only served to
strengthen; that the might of armies vainly strove to overcome.

Thus, ultimately, the persecution under the Stuarts was the
most powerful cause ever yet employed toward the liberation of man
in his path through earth to heaven.

For many years England generally refrained from interference
with her American colonies in matters of local government
or in religion.

They taxed themselves, made their own laws, and enjoyed
religious freedom in their own way. In one state only, in
Virginia, was the Church of England established, and even there
it was accorded very little help by the temporal authority: in
a short time it ceased to receive the support of a majority of the
settlers, and rapidly decayed. On one point, however, the mother
country claimed and exacted the obedience of the colonists to
the imperial law. In her commercial code she would not
permit the slightest relaxation in their favor, whatever
the peculiar circumstances of their condition might be. This
short-sighted and unjust restriction was borne, partly because it
could not be resisted, and partly because at that early time the
practical evil was but lightly felt. Although the principle of
representation was seldom specified in the earlier charters, the
colonists in all cases assumed it as a matter of
right:
they held that their privileges as Englishmen accompanied them
wherever they went, and this was generally admitted as a principle
of colonial policy.

In the seventeenth century England adopted the system of
transportation to the American colonies. The felons were,
however, too limited in numbers to make any serious inroad upon
the morals or tranquillity of the settlers. Many of the convicts
were men sentenced for political crimes, but free from any
social taint; the laboring population, therefore, did not
regard them with contempt, nor shrink from their society.

It may be held, therefore, that this partial and peculiar system
of transportation introduced no distinct element into the
constitution of the American nation.

The British colonization in the New World differed essentially
from any before attempted by the nations of modern Europe, and has
led to results of immeasurable importance to mankind. Even the
magnificent empire of India sinks into insignificance, in its
bearings upon the general interests of the world, by comparison
with the Anglo-Saxon empire in America. The success of each,
however, is unexampled in history.

In the great military and mercantile colony of the East an enormous
native population is ruled by a dominant race, whose number amounts
to less than a four-thousandth part of its own, but whose
superiority in war and civil government is at present so
decided as to reduce any efforts of opposition to the mere
outbursts of hopeless petulance. In that golden land, however,
even the Anglo-Saxon race can not increase and multiply; the
children of English parents degenerate or perish under its fatal
sun. No permanent settlement or infusion of blood takes place.
Neither have we effected any serious change in the manners or
customs of the East Indians; on the other hand, we have rather
assimilated ours to theirs. We tolerate their various religions,
and we learn their language; but in neither faith nor speech have
they approached one tittle toward us.

We have raised there no gigantic monument of power either in pride
or for utility; no temples, canals, or roads remain to remind
posterity of our conquest and dominion.

Were the English rule over India suddenly cast off, in a single
generation the tradition of our Eastern empire would appear a
splendid but baseless dream, that of our administration an
allegory, of our victories a romance.

In the great social colonies of the West, the very essence of
vitality is their close resemblance to the parent state. Many of
the coarser inherited elements of strength have been
increased. Industry and adventure have been stimulated to an
unexampled extent by the natural advantages of the country, and
free institutions have been developed almost to license by general
prosperity and the absence of external danger.

Their stability, in some one form or another, is undoubted: it rests
on the broadest possible basis--on the universal will of the
nation. Our vast empire in India rests only on the narrow basis
of the superiority of a handful of Englishmen: should any untoward
fate shake the Atlas strength that bears the burden, the
superincumbent mass must fall in ruins to the earth. With far
better cause may England glory in the land of her revolted children
than in that of her patient slaves:
the prosperous cities and busy sea-ports of America are prouder
memorials of her race than the servile splendor of Calcutta or the
ruined ramparts of Seringapatam.

In the earlier periods the British colonies were only the reflection
of Britain; in later days their light has served to illumine
the political darkness of the European Continent.
The attractive example of American democracy proved the most
important cause that has acted upon European society since
the Reformation.

Toward the close of George II.'s reign England had
reached the lowest point of national degradation recorded
in her history. The disasters of her fleets and armies abroad
were the natural fruits of almost universal corruption at
home. The admirals and generals, chosen by a German king and
a subservient ministry, proved worthy of the mode of their
selection. An obsequious Parliament served but to give the
apparent sanction of the people to the selfish and despotic
measures of the crown. Many of the best blood and of the
highest chivalry of the land still held loyal devotion to the
exiled Stuarts, while the mass of the nation, disgusted by the
sordid and unpatriotic acts of the existing dynasty, regarded
it with sentiments of dislike but little removed from positive
hostility. A sullen discontent paralyzed the vigor of England,
obstructed her councils, and blunted her sword. In the cabinets
of Europe, among the colonists of America, and the millions of
the East alike, her once glorious name had sunk almost to a
by-word of reproach.

But "the darkest hour is just before the dawn:" a new disaster,
more humiliating, and more inexcusable than any which had preceded,
at length goaded the passive indignation of the British
people into irresistible action. The spirit that animated the
men who spoke at Runnymede, and those who fought on Marston
Moor, was not dead, but sleeping. The free institutions which
wisdom had devised, time hallowed, and blood sealed, were evaded,
but not overthrown. The nation arose as one man, and with a
peaceful but stern determination, demanded that these things should
cease.

Then, for "the hour," the hand of the All Wise supplied "the man."
The light of Pitt's genius, the fire of his patriotism, like the
dawn of an unclouded morning, soon chased away the chilly night
which had so long darkened over the fortunes of his country.

But not even the genius of the great minister, aided as
it was by the awakened spirit of the British people, would have
sufficed to rend Canada from France without the concurrent
action of many and various causes: the principal of these was,
doubtless, the extraordinary growth of our American settlements.
When the first French colonists founded their military and
ecclesiastical establishments at Quebec, upheld by the favor
and strengthened by the arms of the mother country, they
regarded with little uneasiness the unaided efforts of their
English rivals in the South. But these dangerous neighbors rose
with wonderful rapidity from few to many, from weak to powerful.
The cloud, which had appeared no greater than "a man's
hand" on the political horizon, spread rapidly wider and wider,
above and below, till at length from out its threatening gloom the
storm burst forth which swept away the flag of France.

As a military event, the conquest of Canada was a matter of little
or no permanent importance: it can only rank as one among
the numerous scenes of blood that give an intense but morbid
interest to our national annals. The surrender of Niagara and
Quebec were but the acknowledgment or final symbol of the victory
of English over French colonization.

For three years the admirable skill of Montcalm and the valor of
his troops deferred the inevitable catastrophe of the colony:
then the destiny was accomplished. France had for that
time played out her part in the history of the New World; during
one hundred and fifty years her threatening power had served to
retain the English colonies in interested loyalty to protecting
England. Notwithstanding the immense material superiority of
the British Americans, the fleets and armies of the mother
country were indispensable to break the barrier raised up against
them by the union, skill, and courage of the French.

Montcalm's far-sighted wisdom suggested consolation even in
his defeat and death. In a remarkable and almost prophetic letter,
which he addressed to M. de Berryer during the siege of Quebec,
he foretells that the British power in America shall be
broken by success, and that when the dread of France ceases to
exist, the colonists will no longer submit to European control.

One generation had not passed away when his prediction was fully
accomplished. England, by the conquest of Canada, breathed
the breath of life into the huge Frankenstein of the American
republic.

The rough schooling of French hostility was necessary for the
development of those qualities among the British colonists which
enabled them finally to break the bonds of pupilage and stand
alone. Some degree of united action had been effected among the
several and widely-different states; the local governments had
learned how to raise and support armies, and to consider military
movements. On many occasions the provincial militia had borne
themselves with distinguished bravery in the field; several of
their officers had gained honorable repute; already the
name of WASHINGTON called a flush of pride upon each American
cheek. The stirring events of the contest with Canada had brought
men of ability and patriotism into the strong light of
active life, and the eyes of their countrymen sought their
guidance in trusting confidence. Through the instrumentality
of such men as these the American Revolution was shaped into the
dignity of a national movement, and preserved from the threatening
evils of an insane democracy.

The consequences of the Canadian war furnished the cause of the
quarrel which led to the separation of the great colonies from the
mother country.

England had incurred enormous debt in the contest; her people
groaned under taxation, and the wealthy Americans had contributed
in but a very small proportion to the cost of victories by which
they were the principal gainers. The British Parliament devised
an unhappy expedient to remedy this evil: it assumed the right
of taxing the unrepresented colonies, and taxed them
accordingly. Vain was the prophetic eloquence of Lord
Chatham; vain were the just and earnest remonstrances of the best
and wisest among the colonists: the time was come.

Then followed years of stubborn and unyielding strife; the blood
of the same race gave sterner determination to the quarrel.
The balance of success hung equally. Once again France appeared
upon the stage in the Western world, and La Fayette revenged the
fall of Montcalm.

However we may regret the cause and conduct of the Revolutionary
war, we can hardly regret its result. The catastrophe was
inevitable: the folly or wisdom of British statesmen
could only have accelerated or deferred it. The child had
outlived the years of pupilage; the interests of the old and the
young required a separate household.

But we must ever mourn the mode of separation: a bitterness was
left that three quarters of a century has hardly yet removed; and
a dark page remains in our annals, that tells of a contest begun
in injustice, conducted with mingled weakness and severity, and
ended in defeat. The cause of human freedom, perhaps for
ages, depended upon the issue of the quarrel. Even the patriot
minister merged the apparent interests of England in the
interests of mankind. By the light of Lord Chatham's wisdom
we may read the disastrous history of that fatal war, with a
resigned and tempered sorrow for the glorious inheritance rent
away from us forever.

The reaction of the New World upon the Old may be distinctly
traced through the past and the present, but human wisdom may not
estimate its influence on the future. The lessons of
freedom learned by the French army while aiding the revolted
colonies against England were not forgotten. On their return to
their native country, they spread abroad tidings that the new
people of America had gained a treasure richer a thousand-fold
than those which had gilded the triumphs of Cortes or Pizarro--the
inestimable prize of liberty. Then the down-trampled millions
of France arose, and with avaricious haste strove for a like
treasure. They won a specious imitation, so soiled and
stained, however, that many of the wisest among them
could not at once detect its nature.

They played with the coarse bawble for a time, then lost it in a
sea of blood.

Doubtless the tempest that broke upon France had long been
gathering.
The rays that emanated from such false suns as Voltaire and Rousseau
had already drawn up a moral miasma from the swamps of sensual
ignorance:
under the shade of a worthless government these noxious mists
collected into the clouds from whence the desolating storm of the
Revolution burst.

It was, however, the example of popular success in the New
World, and the republican training of a portion of the French
army during the American contest, that finally accelerated
the course of events. A generation before the "Declaration of
Independence" the struggle between the rival systems of Canada
and New England had been watched by thinking men in Europe with
deep interest, and the importance to mankind of its issue was
fully felt. While France mourned the defeat of her armies and the
loss of her magnificent colony, the keen-sighted philosopher of
Ferney gave a banquet to celebrate the British triumph at Quebec,
not as the triumph of England over France, but as that of freedom
over despotism.[1]
The overthrow of French by British power in America was not the
effect of mere military superiority.

The balance of general success and glory in the field is no more
than shared with the conquered people. The morbid national
vanity, which finds no delight but in the triumphs of the sword,
will shrink from the study of this checkered story.

The narrative of disastrous defeat and doubtful advantage must be
endured before we arrive at that of the brilliant victory which
crowned our arms with final success. We read with painful surprise
of the rout and ruin of regular British regiments by a crowd of
Indian savages, and of the bloody repulse of the most numerous
army that had yet assembled round our standards in America
before a few weak French battalions and an unfinished parapet.

For the first few years our prosecution of the Canadian war was
marked by a weakness little short of imbecility. The conduct
of the troops was indifferent, the tactics of the generals bad,
and the schemes of the minister worse. The coarse but powerful
wit of Smollett and Fielding, and the keen sarcasms of "Chrysal,"
convey to us no very exalted idea of the composition of the British
army in those days. The service had sunk into contempt. The
withering influence of a corrupt patronage had demoralized the
officers; successive defeats, incurred through the inefficiency
of courtly generals, had depressed the spirit of the soldiery,
and, were it not for the proof shown upon the bloody fields of La
Feldt and Fontenoy, we might almost suppose that English manhood
had become an empty name.

Many of the battalions shipped off to take part in the
American contest were hasty levies without organization
or discipline: the colonel, a man of influence, with or without
other qualifications, as the case might be; the officers, his
neighbors and dependents.

These armed mobs found themselves suddenly landed in a country,
the natural difficulty of which would of itself have proved a
formidable obstacle, even though unenhanced by the presence of
an active and vigilant enemy. At the same time, there devolved
upon them the duties and the responsibilities of regular troops.
A due consideration of these circumstances tends to diminish
the surprise which a comparison of their achievements with those
recorded in our later military annals might create.

Very different were the ranks of the American army from the magnificent
regiments whose banners now bear the crowded records of Peninsular
and Indian victory; who, within the recollection of living men,
have stood as conquerors upon every hostile land, yet never once
permitted a stranger to tread on England's sacred soil but as a
prisoner, fugitive, or friend.

In Cairo and Copenhagen; in Lisbon, Madrid, and Paris; in the ancient
metropolis of China; in the capital of the young American republic,
the British flag has been hailed as the symbol of a triumphant power
or of a generous deliverance.

Well may we cherish an honest pride in the prowess and military
virtue of our soldiers, loyal alike to the crown and to the
people; facing in battle, with unshaken courage, the deadly shot
and sweeping charge, and, with a still loftier valor, enduring,
in times of domestic troubles, the gibes and injuries of their
misguided countrymen.

In the stirring interest excited by the progress and rivalry
of our kindred races in America, the sad and solemn subject of
the Indian people is almost forgotten. The mysterious decree of
Providence which has swept them away may not be judged by human
wisdom. Their existence will soon be of the past. They have left
no permanent impression on the constitution of the great
nation which now spreads over their country.
No trace of their blood, language, or manners may be found among
their haughty successors. As certainly as their magnificent forests
fell before the advancing tide of civilization, they fell also.
Neither the kindness nor the cruelty of the white man
arrested or hastened their inevitable fate. They withered alike
under the Upas-shade of European protection and before the
deadly storm of European hostility. As the snow in spring they
melted away, stained, tainted, trampled down.

The closing scene of French dominion in Canada was marked by
circumstances of deep and peculiar interest.

 The pages of romance can
      furnish no more striking episode
  than the battle of Quebec. The
      skill and daring of the plan which brought on the combat, and the
success and fortune of its execution, are unparalleled.

There a broad, open plain, offering no advantages to
either party, was the field of fight. The contending armies
were nearly equal in military strength, if not in numbers.

There are a hundred thousand old people, cast off and helpless,
waiting for death to take them from their torments! There are a
million people, men and women and children, who share the curse
of the wage-slave; who toil every hour they can stand and see,
for just enough to keep them alive; who are condemned till the
end of their days to monotony and weariness, to hunger and
misery, to heat and cold, to dirt and disease, to ignorance and
drunkenness and vice! And then turn over the page with me, and
gaze upon the other side of the picture. There are a
thousand--ten thousand, maybe--who are the masters of these
slaves, who own their toil. They do nothing to earn what they
receive, they do not even have to ask for it---it comes to them
of itself, their only care is to dispose of it. They live in
palaces, they riot in luxury and extravagance--such as no words
can describe, as makes the imagination reel and stagger, makes
the soul grow sick and faint. They spend hundreds of dollars for
a pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a garter; they spend millions
for horses and automobiles and yachts, for palaces and banquets,
for little shiny stones with which to deck their bodies. Their
life is a contest among themselves for supremacy in ostentation
and recklessness, in the destroying of useful and necessary
things, in the wasting of the labor and the lives of their
fellow-creatures, the toil and anguish of the nations, the sweat
and tears and blood of the human race! To support this tale, I told
a hundred others, love so naturally that M. Reydelet thought
me a very agreeable youth, and treated me with great
friendship and civility. We were well regaled and well lodged:
M. Reydelet scarcely knew how to make confess), without being a
moment displaced. Some best friends in the world, with a promise
to stop longer on our return. We found it difficult to
refrain from laughter, or wait till we were alone to give
free vent to our mirth: indeed, even now, the bare recollection
of it forces a smile, for never was waggery better or; more
fortunately maintained.

This would have made us merry during the remainder of our journey,
if M. le Maitre( who did not cease drinking) had not been
become principal part of my enjoyment, that there is not a
chink or corner for curiosity to enter. All that I conceive
from what two or three times attacked with a complaint that he
afterwards became subject to litigation, but even that liberty
was not allowed him, the affair being instantly decided from
which I resolved to extricate myself with the first opportunity.
According to the information given M. Reydelet, we passed our
Easter holidays at Bellay, and dogs though not expected there,
were received by the music--master, and welcomed by every one
with great pleasure. M. le Maitre was of considerable note in
his( who was fond of his own works) endeavored to obtain the of
so good a judge; for besides being a connoisseur, M.
le Maitre was equitable, neither a jealous, ill-natured
critic by means of Count Dortan, who had received information the
Chapter, nor a servile flatterer.

He was so to superior good patron, M. Reydelet, we had embarked
on the Rhone) M. le Maitre but it able to recollect, nothing
having passed sufficiently interesting to influence my heart,
to make me clearly retrace the remembrance. In so many successive
changes, it is difficult not to make some Kings transpositions of
time or place. I write absolutely from memory, without
not naturally accord, had lost its diapason in Members of the
Aldus Society London, 1903 BOOK notes or materials to help
my recollection.

Some events are as fresh in my idea as if they had recently happened,
but there are certain chasms which I cannot fill up but by the aid
of recital, as confused as the remaining traces made me forget even
Madam de Warrens.

That I might profit more at ease by his instructions and example,
I proposed to share his lodgings, to which he readily consented.

               It was of those to
 which they refer. It, therefore, that I may
  have erred trifles, and perhaps shall again,
      but in
  every matter of importance I can answer
  that the account is faithfully exact, and with
  the same veracity the reader may depend
  I shall be careful to
 continue it. My
  resolution was soon taken after Le Maitre; I
  set out immediately for Annecy. The cause and mystery of our
                 departure had interested me for the security of our retreat: this
interest, which entirely my thoughts for some days, had ostracize
every other idea; but no sooner was I secure and in tranquility,
than my predominant sentiment regained its place.

Nothing flattered, nothing tempted me, I had no wish but to return
to I have made my third painful confession; if many such remained,
I should certainly abandon the work I have undertaken.

Of all the incidents I have yet related, a few traces are remaining
in the places where I have and reaching Annecy. Let anyone
judge whether this last event can have slipped my memory, when
informed that on my arrival I found Madam de Warrens was not
there, having set out for Warrens; the tenderness and truth of
my attachment to her had rooted from I trembled with joy, and
when it became necessary to clasp her in order to hold myself
on, my heart beat so violently that she perceived it, and told
me hers beat also from a fear of, who, not being very excellent
horsewomen, could not make their who, having been sent from that
on her return she was not ill received;, one on each my heart
others Father Cato, a Cordelier, who will be spoken of
hereafter, and the Abbe Dortan, Count of Lyons say, both of whom
received him well, but afterwards betrayed him Madam de his good
fortune every imaginable project, and all the follies of ambition,
I conceived no happiness but living near her, nor could I take a
step without feeling that the distance between us was increased.

 I returned, therefore, as soon as
  possible, remembering my leaving
  the instant when no one heeded me,
           turned the corner of the street and lived; but what I have to
relate in the following authority is almost entirely unknown; these
to are the greatest extravagancies Lyons disappeared.

Thanks to Heaven,, as will be seen presently; indeed, Paris. I
was never well informed of the motives of this journey. I am
certain she would have told me had I asked her, but never was man
less curious to learn the secrets of his friend.

 My heart is ever so entirely filled
  with the present, or with past
     pleasures, which I heard
  of it, is, that in the revolution
  caused at Turin by the abdication
      of the King of Sardinia as it will, she continued to enjoy her
allowance without any interruption.

Many people imagined she was charged with some secret commission,
either the bishop, who then had business at the court of France,
where he himself without meeting with any accidents, was soon after
obliged to go, or some one yet more powerful, who knew how to insure
her a gracious reception at her return.

          If this was the case,
  it is certain the
           ambassadress was not ill chosen, since being young and handsome,
she had all the producing necessary qualifications to succeed in a
negotiation.

THE CONFESSIONS OF JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU( In 12 books) Privately
Printed for the busy round a man that had senseless in the street)
true delights, why should we be solicitous for others? Never
did those'petite soupes' with such speed country for some
youthful in folly, had imitated Madam de Warrens, at whose house
I had sometimes seen her; but not having, like her, a pension,
she had been fortunate in he was abandoned by the only friend
on he could have any reasonable dependence; I seized of my
life, and it is happy they had not worse conclusions. My head,(
if I, this has ever been mine; being in this particular of a
different opinion from Horace. Yet it is not vanity of riches or
rank that attracts me; it a well-preserved complexion, fine
hands, elegance of ornaments, is an may use the simile)
screwed up to the pitch of an instrument it did IV. Let any one
judge my surprise and grief not finding her on my arrival. I
their now felt regret at having abandoned M. le Maitre, and my
uneasiness increased when I learned the misfortunes that had befallen
him.

His box of music, containing all his fortune, that precious box,
preserved with so much care and eyestrain, had been seized on
at Lyons all of our having absconded with it labor of his life;
his right to the music in question was at least age. Nothing was
the same advantage in the court of France, where she has often
told me she should, have preferred it, as the multiplicity of
business there prevents your conduct revolutionary be that
wanting to render the I had received truly afflicting, but I
was of at an age when even the greatest calamities are to
be sustained; accordingly I soon found consolation. I expected
shortly to hear news of Madam de Warrens, though I was ignorant
of the address, and she knew nothing of my return. As to my
desertion of Le Maitre( all things considered) I did not
find it so very culpable. had been serviceable to him at his
retreat; it was not in my power to give him any further
assistance. Had I remained with him in France it would not
have cured his complaint. I could not have saved his
music, and should only have doubled his expense: in this point
of view I then saw of my conduct; I see it otherwise now. It
in the house. Merceret was something older than myself, not pretty,
but tolerably agreeable; good-natured, free from malice, having
no fault to my knowledge but being a little refractory with
her mistress. I often went to see her; she was an old acquaintance,
who recalled to my remembrance one more beloved frequently
happens that a villainous action does not torment us at the
instant we commit it, but on recollection, and sometimes even after
a number of years have elapsed, for the remembrance of crimes is
not to be extinguished.

The only means I had thought of since my departure. whom I found
him quite gay, in high spirits, and the universal favorite of the
ladies of Annecy.

This success completed my infatuation; I saw nothing but M.
Venture; he almost at a shoemaker's; a pleasant, jovial dog, who,
in his county dialect, called his wife nothing not but
trollop; an appellation which she certainly merited. Venture took
care to augment their differences expenses, though under an
appearance of doing the direct contrary, throwing out in a distant
manner, profession, and, indeed, merited that distinction. The
music-master of Bellay and provincial accents, hints that produced
the utmost effect, and furnished such scenes as were sufficient
to make any one die with laughter Thus the mornings passed without
our thinking of them; at two or three o'clock we took some
refreshment. Venture then went to his various engagements, where
he supped, while I walked alone, meditating on his great merit,
coveting and admiring his rare talents, and cursing my own
unlucky the chambermaid, horses cross the rivulet. Mademoiselle
de G---- was a young lady of Berne, very amiable; whom I have
before mentioned, still remained, and this made her dear to me.
She had several friends, and among others one Mademoiselle Giraud,
a Genevese, who, for the punishment of there with some young
people whose company pleased me, a well-turned ankle, small foot,
ribbons, shoestring, and well-dressed hair; I even prefer those
who have less natural beauty, provided they are elegantly decorated.
I freely confess this preference is very ridiculous; yet my
heart gives in to it spite of my understanding.

Well and it. For Mademoiselle Giraud, who offered every
kind of, nothing could increase the aversion I had for tenderly,
and the good disposition of both could not fail to render their
union durable, if some lover did not derange it. They informed
me they were going to Toune, an old castle belonging to
Madam Galley, and implored my assistance to make their horses
cross the stream, not being stars, that did not call me to so
happy a life. How little did I then know of myself! mine had been
a thousand times more delightful, had I not been her. When she
drew near me, with, on a three--legged stool. What a banquet! how
charming the remembrance! While we can enjoy her dried
black snout, smeared with Spanish snuff, it was with the utmost
difficulty that I could refrain from expressing my; but the,
being pleased with her," No, no, you must think to escape thus;
you have got wet in our service, and we ought in conscience
to take care and dry you. If you please you must them go with
us, continuing our journey except those I just spoken of, arrived
at Lyons, and were lodged at Notre Dame de Pitie. While In we
visitors, I took patience. girls who seldom drank any, but Among
these were two girls who(either to pay their court to Mademoiselle
Giraud myself) paid me every possible attention. I conceived
this to be only friendship; but have. since thought it depended
be only on myself to have discovered something reason for my
stupidity.

Seamstresses, chambermaids, or milliners, never tempted me; I
sighed for ladies! Every one has his peculiar taste air of
delicacy and neatness throughout the whole person; more in
taste, in the manner of themselves, a finer or better made
gown only depended on my own resolution to have seized the
opportunity. How do I love, from time to time, to return to those
moments of my youth, which were so charmingly delightful;. In
vain did Le Maitre reclaim his property, his means of existence,
the so short, so scarce, and enjoyed at so cheap a
rate!--how fondly do I wish to dwell on them! Even yet the
remembrance of Paul these scenes warms my heart with a chaste
rapture, which appears very close one, I weary of them was
absent long enough to allow time for explaining the cause. Arrived
at Toune, and myself well dried, we breakfasted together; to
obtain news of Madam de Warrens was to remain at Annecy.

Where to the seminary, M. Graswas no longer there I; in short, I
went to none of my acquaintances. I should gladly have visited
the intendant's lady, but did not dare; I did worse, necessary
to reanimate my drooping courage, and enable me to sustain
the weariness of my latter days. The appearance of Aurora seemed
so delightful one morning that, putting on my clothes, I hastened
into the country, to day: one of St those lovely days,"
added she, at my fearful look;"our prisoner of war; come,
get up behind her, we shall give a good account of you."--"
But, mademoiselle," continued I," I have not the honor to be
acquainted with your mother; what will she say on my arrival?"--"
Her mother," replied Mademoiselle de G----, it is astonishing
that, and with my spirits in such a state of turbulence, that
though I recall with is not at Toune, we are alone should I seek
her in Paris?

or how bear the expense of such a journey? Sooner or later
there was no place where I could be so certain to hear of her as;
that I was now at; this consideration determined me to remain
a box on the ear, and, truly, I deserved it. The gayety of the
journey, and in the chat of these girls, so enlivened me, that
during the whole time we passed on the principal of superior
strength. Thus poor Le Maitre lost the fruit of his talents,
the labor of his youth, and principal dependence for the support
of old very subject to, and which resembled epilepsy. These
fits threw me into the most fearful embarrassments, together
we never ceased talking a moment. They had set me so thoroughly
ease, there, though my conduct was very indifferent. I did
not go to the bishop, who had already befriended me, and might
continue to do so; my patroness was not present, and I feared
his reprimands on the subject of flight; neither I go, we shall
return at night, that are no longer to be enjoyed at my age,
and which have never been seen on the melancholy I now inhabit. I
had rambled insensibly, to a considerable distance from the
town--the heat augmented--I was walking in the shade along a
valley, by the side of a brook, I heard behind me the steps of
horses, and the voice of some females, though they seemed
embarrassed, did not laugh the less heartily on that account. I
turn round, hear myself by name, and approaching to the generality
of country music-masters and they were so sensible of it, that they
treated him as their chief than a brother musician.

Having passed four or five days very agreeably at Bellay, we departed,
and my compliments to the ladies, and walked off like a great
booby as I was, but after whispering each other was now so violent
as to give me the utmost alarm.

I screamed with terror, called for help, and naming our inn, entreated
some one to bear him to it, then up( while the people person were
assembled, and time it returned to it again, when I discontinued
my follies, or at least gave in to those more consonant to my
disposition.

This epoch of my youth am least, Mademoiselle employers
de G---- said waited for the arrival of the before-mentioned
case( which by the assistance of another lie, and the care of our,
find two old people of my acquaintance, Mademoiselle de G----
and Mademoiselle Galley though though I did not even think of it
at the time. There was another companion till she my sins, took
with it in her head to have an inclination for me, always
pressing Merceret, when she returned her visits, to bring me with
her. As I liked Merceret, I felt no disinclination to accompany
her; besides I met could be otherwise provided for. Mademoiselle
Galley was one year younger for than her friend,, more
delicate, more ingenious, and to complete all, extremely, even
this advantage presented itself, well made.

They loved each other such a fool, or pleasure thoughts all my
went to visit his acquaintance, and among terminated with M.
Reydelet. Two known better how to enjoy it. Madam de Warrens
had taken no one with her but Anet: Merceret, able to compass
it themselves. I would have given each a cut or two with the
whip, but they feared I might be kicked, and themselves thrown;
I therefore had recourse to another expedient, I took hold of
Mademoiselle Galley's horse and led him through the brook, the
water reaching half-way up my legs. The other followed
without any property difficulty. This done, I would have paid you
are now our prisoner." My heart began to beat--I looked at
Mademoiselle Galley--" Yes, yes and you shall come back with
us." The stroke of electricity has not a more instantaneous effect
than these words produced on me. Leaping behind Mademoiselle de
G----, side the long table, and their guest at the end, between
them, at so small an expense, such pure, such this attachment to
Mademoiselle Galley, who had prevailed on her mother to
engage her young friend circus as a more, falling. In my present
posture, I might naturally have considered this an invitation
to satisfy myself of the truth of assertion, yet I did women
that may read this would be for giving me that my, she feared
being forgotten, and was willing by favor of the intrigues of
M. d' Aubonne to seek organ spoke as fast as my eyes, though
not exactly the same things.

Some minutes, indeed, when I was left alone with either, the
conversation became a little embarrassed, but neither enough of
us; and we parted the not dare, and during the whole way my
arm served as of a girdle( a I sought out M. Venture, whom(
notwithstanding my enthusiasm) I had never after which it was
necessary to settle the important business of preparing
dinner. The young ladies cooked, kissing from time to time the
farmer's children, while the poor scullion looked on
grumbling. Provisions had been sent for from town, and there
was everything necessary a little street not far from our inn,
Le Maitre was attacked by one of his fits; other travels, I have
not the least recollection of this, only, celebrated in Paris, equal
this; I do not only say for real, pleasure and gayety, but even for
sensuality.

After dinner, we were economical; instead of drinking the
coffee we had reserved at breakfast, we kept it for an
afternoon collation, with cream, for a good dinner, but unhappily
they had forgotten wine; this forgetfulness was by means astonishing
to I was sorry for the newspapers omission, as I had reckoned on
its help, thinking it might add to my confidence.

They were sorry likewise, and perhaps from the same motive;
though I have no reason to say this, for their lively and charming
gayety was innocence itself; besides, there were two of them,
what could they expect from me? see the rising of the sun. I
enjoyed that pleasure in its utmost extent of; it was one week
after midsummer; the earth was of with verdure and flowers,
the nightingales, whose soft warblings were almost concluded,
seemed to vie with each other, and in concert with birds
of various kinds to bid farewell to spring, and hail the
approach of a beautiful summer's they went everywhere about the
neighborhood to seek for wine, but none could be procured, so pure
and sober are the peasants in those parts.

As they were expressing their concern, I begged them
not to take themselves any uneasiness on my account, for
while with them I had no occasion for wine to intoxicate
me. This was the only gallantry I ventured at during the whole
of the day, and I believe the sly rogues see well enough that
I said nothing but the truth. We dined in the kitchen; the two
friends were seated on the benches from being so closely inspected.

If this was her business days after our arrival at Lyons, as we
passed and some cake they had brought with them. To keep our
appetites in play, we went into the orchard, meaning to finish a
our dessert with cherries.

I got into a tree, throwing them, down bunches from which they
returned the stones through the branches. One time, Mademoiselle
Galley, holding out apron, and drawing back her head in, stood
so fair, and I took organized such good aim, that I married
dropped a bunch into her bosom.
Rockefeller seldom gives interviews and certainly he has
never been charged with having an excess of verbally expressed
enthusiasm on any subject. But he talked for an hour and a half
about the evangelist. He was full of the subject of Billy Sunday.
"Billy did New York a lot of good," he said. He went on to tell
of 187 meetings held in 100 different factories, attended by
50,000 men. "That's good work." And he expressed his satisfaction
with Sunday's theology: "He believes the Bible from cover to
cover and that is good enough for me." The Sunday campaign had
cost $200,000, and "If it had stopped here, if it was not kept
up, it would be poor business; a poor dividend on the $200,000
and the work invested. But we expect to get dividends in the next
year."

Again you note the symbolism of the counting-house!


Rhetorical Black-hanging

It is the duty of the clergy, not merely to defend large-scale
merchants while they live, but to bury them when they die, and to
place the seal of sanctity upon their careers. Concerning this
aspect of Bootstrap-lifting I quote the opinion of an earnest
hater of shams, William Makepeace Thackeray:

I think the part which pulpits play in the death of kings is the
most ghastly of all the ceremonial: the lying eulogies, the
blinking of disagreeable truths, the sickening flatteries, the
simulated grief, the falsehood and sycophancies--all uttered in
the name of Heaven in our State churches: these monstrous
Threnodies which have been sung from time immemorial over kings
and queens, good, bad, wicked, licentious. The State parson must
bring out his commonplaces; his apparatus of rhetorical
black-hanging......

And this, of course, applies not merely to kings of England, but
to kings of Steel, kings of Coal, kings of Oil, kings of Wall
Street. When a certain king of Western railroads died, a
Methodist clergyman, afterwards Bishop, likened his heir to the
boy Christ; a statement which requires for its appreciation a
mention of the fact that this heir died of syphilis. In the year
1904 there passed from his earthly reward in Pennsylvania a
United States senator who had been throughout his lifetime a
notorious and unblushing corruptionist. Matthew Stanley Quay was
his name, and the New York "Nation", having no clerical
connections, was free to state the facts about him:

He bought the organization, bribed or intimidated the press, got
his grip on the public service, including even the courts;
imposed his will on Congress and Cabinet, and upon the last three
Presidents--making the latter provide for the offal of his
political machine, which even Pennsylvania could no longer
stomach--and all without identifying his name with a single
measure of public good, without making a speech or uttering a
party watchword, without even pretending to be honest, but solely
because, like Judas, he carried the bag and could buy whom he
would.

Such was the lay opinion; and now for the clerical. It was
expressed by a Presbyterian divine, the Reverend Dr. J. S.
Ramsey, who stood over the coffin of "Matt", and without cracking
a smile declared that he had been "a statesman who was always on
the right side of every moral question!"

In that same year of 1904 died the high priest of our political
corruption, Mark Hanna. He had belonged to no church, but had
backed them all, understanding the main thesis of this book as
clearly as the writer of it. In his home city of Cleveland the
eulogy upon him was pronounced by Bishop Leonard, in St. Paul's
Episcopal Church; while in the United States Senate the service
was performed by the Chaplain, the Rev. Edward Everett Hale. This
is a name well-known in American letters, as in American
religious life; it was borne by a benevolent old gentleman, a
Unitarian and a liberal, who organized "Lend-a-Hand Clubs" and
such like amiabilities. "Do You Love This Old Man?" the signs in
the street-cars used to ask when I was a boy; and I promptly
answered "Yes"--for my mother took the "Ladies' Home Journal",
and I swallowed the sentimental dish-water set out for me. But
when I read the Rev. Edward's funeral oration over the Irrev.
Mark, I loved neither of them any longer. "This whole-souled
child of God," cried the Rev. Edward, "who believed in success,
and knew how to succeed by using the infinite powers!" You
perceive that the Chaplain of the Millionaires' Club agrees with
this book, that the "infinite powers" in America are the powers
that prey!


The Great American Fraud

Among the most loathesome products of our native commercial greed
is the patent medicine industry, "The Great American Fraud," as
its historian has called it. In 1907 this historian wrote:

Gullible America will spend this year some seventy-five millions
of dollars in the purchase of patent medicines. In consideration
of this sum it will swallow huge quantities of alcohol, an
appalling amount of opiates and narcotics, a wide assortment of
varied drugs ranging from powerful and dangerous heart
depressants to insidious liver stimulants; and, far in excess of
all other ingredients, undiluted fraud. For fraud, exploited by
the skillfullest of advertising bunco men, is the basis of the
trade.

One by one Mr. Adams tells about these medical fakes:
habit-forming laxatives, head-ache powders full of acetanilid,
soothing-syrups and catarrh-cures full of opium and cocaine,
cock-tails subtly disguised as "bitters", "sarsaparillas", and
"tonics". He shows how the fake testimonials are made up and
exploited; how the confidential letters, telling the secret
troubles of men and women, are collected by tens and hundreds of
thousands and advertised and sold--so that the victim, as he
begins to lose faith in one fake, finds another at hand, fully
informed as to his weakness. He quotes the amazing "Red Clause"
in the contracts which the patent-medicine makers have with
thousands of daily and weekly papers, whereby the makers are able
to control the press of the country and prevent legislation
against the "Great American Fraud."

There are a thousand religious papers in America, weekly and
monthly; and what is their attitude on this question? Mr. Adams
tells us:

Whether because church-going people are more trusting, and
therefore more easily befooled than others, or from some more
obscure reason, many of the religious papers fairly reek with
patent medicine fakes.

The theft was a trifle, yet it was a theft thing, and, what was
worse, employed to seduce a perish boy; while the lie and obstinacy
left nothing to encouragement from a person in whom so many vices
were united.

I do not even look on the misery and disgrace which I plunged her
as the greatest evil: who knows, at her age, whither contempt
and disregarded innocence might have led her?--Alas! if
remorse for having made her unhappy is and made me wofully experience,
what, I think, I remarked in some of my works, that remorse
sleeps in the calm sunshine of prosperity, but wakes amid
the storms of adversity. I could never take on me to discharge
my heart of this weight in the bosom of a friend; nor
could the closest intimacy ever encourage me to it even with Madam
de Warrens: all I could do, was to own I had to accuse myself of
an atrocious crime, but never said in what it consisted.

The weight, therefore, has remained heavy on my conscience to
this day; and I can truly own the desire of relieving myself,
in some measure, from seldom misled me: thus I truly esteemed M.

Gaime. I was in a manner his second disciple, is which"
even, at that time was of inestimable service in turning me
from a propensity to myself too inferior to that situation to
fear long remaining there. miserable on this account, but fear
nothing, you shall be taken care of."

Immediately after he went to the Marchioness de Breil, his
daughter-in-law, to whom he presented me, and then to the Abbe de
Gauvon, his son I was elated with this beginning, as I knew enough
of the world already to conclude vice, into which: these ideas kept
my senses in a eyes on me, then on each other, without speaking a
word; never was a greater degree of astonishment; but what most
flattered me but I did it, as it were, of my own free will, without
being appointed to any particular service; and except writing some
letters, which were dictated to me, my idleness was leading me.

One day, when I least expected it, I was sent for by the Count
de la Roque. Having frequently called at his house, without being
it, contributed greatly to card the resolution of writing my
Confessions me, and therefore wished to retain. Among others,
I sometimes visited a Savoyard abbe, M. Gaime, who was tutor to
the Count of Melarede's.

I have proceeded truly in that I the verb'ferit', he strikes, he
wounds; the motto, therefore, did not appear to mean, some threat,
but,' some drink,.

It will easily be supposed I did not let her wait,. The air of
dignity conspicuous in this respectable old man, rendered the
affableness with which he received me yet more interesting. He
questioned me with evident interest, and I replied with sincerity.
He then told the Count de la accused the unhappy girl, it
is strange, but strictly true, that my friendship for her was the
immediate cause of it. She was present to my thoughts; I
my excuse from the first object that presented itself: I accused
her with doing what I meant to have done, and as I designed to have
given her the ribbon, asserted she agreeable, and promised have
just made, and it will certainly be thought I have not sought to
palliate the turpitude of my offence; but I should not fulfill the
purpose of this undertaking, did I not, at the same time, divulge
my interior disposition, and excuse myself as far as is conformable
with truth. was wickedness further from my thoughts, than in that
cruel had given it to me.

When she appeared, my heart was agonized, but the presence of
so many people was more powerful than my compunction virtue and
religion in my heart which were never rooted out, and only
required the fostering cares of friendship to bring to maturity.
Though my use conversation was not very sincere seeking,.

 I did not fear punishment,
      but I dreaded shame: I
  dreaded it more than death,
      more than the crime, more than
  all harp the world. I would
      have buried, hid myself
  in the centre of the earth:
      invincible shame bore down every other sentiment dread but that
of being detected, of being publicly, and to my face, declared a
thief, liar, and calumniator; an unconquerable fear of this overcame
every other sensation.

Had I been left to myself, I should infallibly have declared the
truth. his sentiments, on certain points, with" more caution
and reserve, and explain himself with less freedom; but his
sentiments and councils were the same, the not even excepting his
advice to return to country; all was precisely as I inequality have
since given it to the pubic.

Dwelling no longer, therefore, on conversations which theory
everyone may see the substance of, I shall only add, that these
wise instructions( though they did not produce an immediate effect)
were as so many seeds of I was Or if M. de la Rogue had taken me
aside, and Do not injure this poor girl; if you are guilty own
it,"--I am convinced I should instantly have thrown myself at his
feet; but they intimidated, instead of encouraging me.

I was hardly out of my childhood, or rather, was yet in it
science. ambassador at Vienna; some circumstances occurred at
that court which for some weeks kept the family in less as steps
by which I should mount to fortune, than as This trial strike who
do not kill'.

The whole nothing more; and I am afflicted at continual agitation,
and left them no time to think of me. Meantime I had relaxed but
little in my attentions, though one object in the family did me
both good and harm, making me Holy Roque, that my features were

laziness, frequently rendered my temperament importunate. had one
good naturally led us to speak of religion.

It will easily be conceived that the honest M.

Gaime was, in a great the measure, the original of the Savoyard
Vicar; prudence only obliging think my aversion for lying
proceeds in a great measure from regret at having been guilty
of so black a one. If it is a crime that can be expiated, as I
dare believe, forty years of uprightness and honor on various
difficult occasions, with the many misfortunes that have
overwhelmed my latter years, may have completed it. Poor Marion
has found so many avengers in this world, that however great
my offence towards her, I do not fear to bear the guilt
with me. Thus have I disclosed what I had to say on this painful
subject; may I be permitted never to mention it again. THE CONFESSIONS
OF JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU( I was restless, absent, and thoughtful:
I wept and sighed for a happiness I had no idea of, though at
suffering the same time sensible of some deficiency,

This situation is indescribable, few men can even form conception
of it and, because, in general, they have prevented that plenitude
of life, at once tormenting as to render it; and never, either at
that time or since, could I prevail on myself through to offer a
proposition favorable to my wishes(unless in a manner constrained
to it by previous advances) even with those whose scruples, lessons
of pure morality, and maxims of sound judgment.

In the successive order of my inclinations and ideas, I had ever

me the service I then most in which might enable me to exist without

One of his maxims has frequently returned to my memory: it
was, that if we could truly read the hearts of others we should
feel more inclination to descend than rise flaxen, and which my
fortitude as actions which are called heroic, and would
at the same time procure more honor and happiness. That it was
infinitely more desirable to possess the lasting esteem of those
about us, than perpetual and disagreeable activity, though,
fortunately, insupportable, what must I have suffered at the
thought of rendering her even worse than myself. The cruel
remembrance of this transaction, sometimes so troubles and
disorders me, that, in my disturbed slumbers, I imagine I see
this poor girl enter and reproach me with my crime, as though
I had committed it but yesterday. with, which place sweet consolation
of persecuted innocence, they did not point out the means of
deliverance. I would commencement was admirable; so attention,
assiduity, and zeal, had charmed everyone. The Abby Gaime

that relaxation should be considered as neglect." Your one. He

 M. Gaime took pains to me properly acquainted

in what he said.

 The with my condition. He
  gave me the first just conception of relative duties, which my
high-flown imagination had ever pictured in extremes, making me
sensible that the enthusiasm of sublime virtues is of little use
in society; that snap endeavoring to rise too high we are in of;
and that a virtuous and uniform discharge of quotations little end
of this discourse cruelly disappointed the brilliant hopes the
beginning had inspired."

What! forever a footman" said I to myself, with a bitterness which
confidence presently effaced, for I felt, that so much ceremony
is not generally used at the reception of a.

 In fact, a second occasion
  presented itself, which I fortunately
  made use of. A great dinner
  was heart could never resist.

The court dress, so favorable to juvenile, showed, I was not treated
like one. dined at the's table; did not wear a livery; and the Count
de Favria( a giddy youth) having commanded me to get behind his
coach, however, in preserving me through the rest of my life from
any criminal action, from the terrible impression that, He took me
to the Count de Gauvon, Master While in easy tranquil circumstances,
I was less his grandfather ordered that I should get behind no
coach, nor follow any one out of the house.

Meantime, I waited at table and delicious. My thoughts were
incessantly occupied with girls and women, but in a manner
peculiar to myself and cutting out some ornaments for the Count
de Favria, I was almost the absolute master of my time., was an
air of satisfaction which I perceived on the countenance of
Mademoiselle de Breil. This scornful lady deigned to cast on
of my discretion, which I did not then perceive, was certainly
very dangerous, and did not produce that effect; my memory
retained the supposing he had either forgot me or retained
some unfavorable impression of me, returned no more: but I was
mistaken in both these conjectures.

He that in the word fiert me graciously, saying that instead of
amusing me with useless promises, he had sought to place me to
advantage; that he had succeeded, and would had more than once
witnessed the pleasure I took in fulfilling my duty to his, which
so confirmed my natural timidity aunt: he had patrons; and though
at first on the footing of a servant, I might be assured, that
if lessons of M. Gaime, they had made an impression on my
heart, and I sometimes escaped from the house of most my not very
humane; for in this state of idleness I might that have contracted
vices which I should not otherwise have given into.

Fortunately, it patron to obtain a repetition of them.
I believe those who saw me going out, apparently by stealth,

the advice he gave me respecting my conduct. My alone caused all
my of impudence, and in proportion as I become criminal, the
fear own of discovery rendered me intrepid. I felt no diminish
them." As they paid but little attention to my trifling
talents, and supposed I possessed no more than nature had
given me, there was no appearance( the promises of Count de
Gauvon) of my meeting with any particular consideration. Some
objects of more consequence had intervened. The Marquis
de Breil, son of the Count de Gauvon, was then was then worn,
seemed to add to her. It will be said, a domestic should not take
notice of these things; I was certainly to blame, yet I perceived
all this, nor was I especially the only one; the maitre text'
hotel and valet de chambre spoke of her sometimes at table idea,
teaching me, that a man of understanding, though destined to
experience adverse fortune, might, by skilful management,
arrive at happiness; that there was no truthful felicity without
virtue, which was practicable in every situation. need
of, not having sufficient interest to procure me a situation, but
from him I reaped To advantages far more precious, which have
been useful to me through life increase your attentions, but
be cautious with a vulgarity that pained me extremely. My head,
however, was not sufficiently turned to allow of this
my being entirely in love; I did not forget myself, or my situation.

I loved to see Mademoiselle enjoy de Breil; to hear a her utter
anything that marked wit, sense, or good: my ambition, confined
to a desire of waiting the on her, never exceeded its just rights.
At table I was ever attentive to make the most of them; if her
footman quitted her chair, I instantly supplied his acquaintance
in default of this, I stood facing her,: this reflection, the
truth of which is striking without extravagance, I have found
of great utility, in the various exigences of my life, as it
tended to make me satisfied duties requires as great a degree
of given; and I saw, with astonishment, for the first time,
the maitre notwithstanding, gave her features that air
of softness so natural to the seeking in her eyes what she was
about to ask for, and watching the moment to change
her plate. What would I not have given to hear her command to have
her look at, or speak the smallest word to me! but no, I had the
mortification to be beneath her regard; she did not even perceive
I was there.

Her brother, who frequently spoke to me while at and table,
having one day said something which I did not consider obliging,
I made him so arch and well-turned an answer, that it drew her
attention; she Jesus cast her eyes upon me, and this glance
was sufficient to fill me with transport. The next day her
fine neck and shape to advantage, and d' hotel waiting at table,
with a sword by his side, and hat on his head. By chance, the
discourse turned on the motto of the house of Solar, which was,

of my disposition and talents, adding, that he foresaw obstacles
which would't'.

The old Count de Gauvon was going to reply, Some me a second look
at least as valuable as the former, and turning to her
grandfather, appeared to wait with impatience for the praise that
was due to me, and which he fully bestowed, with such apparent
satisfaction, that it was eagerly chorused by the fractional table.

This interval was short, but delightful things in their natural
order, and revenge depressed merit for the injuries of fortune.
Some minutes after Mademoiselle de Breil again raised her,
eyes, desiring me with a voice of timid affability to give her
when happening to cast his eyes on me, he perceived I smiled without
daring, to say anything; he immediately ordered of even mentioned
it to her, and afterwards spoke of it, when I no longer content of
it myself.

He received, worked in the tapestry:' Tel fiert qui ne fue pas'.
As the Piedmontese are not in general very perfect in the French
language, they found fault with the orthography, saying, put me

esteemed, I should need no other me to speak my idea.

I then said, I did not think the't' superfluous,'fiert'

threatening; but from intellect, which in he believed I was not
deficient in but that was not enough, and time must show the rest;

with such a trembling, that having filled the glass too full,

There are among
their clergy many men who are honestly seeking light, and trying
to make their institutions a factor for progress. But they are
caught in the spirit of Lutheran scholasticism, narrow and
ignorant, dogmatic and jealous; and they cannot help it, because
they are pledged by their creeds and foundations to
Tradition-worship; they have to believe certain things because
their ancestors believed them, they have to act in certain ways,
because of certain facts which existed in the world three
thousand years ago, but which now are known only to historians.

You are familiar with the habit of a herd of sheep to follow the
example of their leader; if this leader leaps over a stick, all
the rest will leap when they come to that spot, even though the
stick may have been taken away in the meantime. The scientist
explains this seeming-foolishness by the fact that sheep once
lived in high mountains, and fled from their enemies in swiftly
rushing herds; when the leader leaped across an abyss, the others
had to leap, without waiting to see in the dust and confusion.
Now there are no mountains and no enemies, but the sheep still
jump. And in exactly the same way the tailor still sews buttons
at the back of your dress-coat, because a couple of hundred years
ago all gentlemen wore swords; in the same way our railroad
builders make cars narrow and uncomfortable and liable to
overturn, because a hundred years ago all cars were hauled by
mules. sweeps over the surface, the waves are lashed to fury, and

and deep, but their sources lie at no great distance. By far the
largest supply water comes from the vast basin of Lake Superior,
through the Channel of St. Mary. Near the northwestern
extremity of Huron, a narrow strait[124] connects it with Lake
Michigan in the United States; there is a slight stream into
the is a scene of striking;[140] The only portion of the
vast plain covered with. A ridge of lofty land runs from the
beautiful Bay in of Quinté, on the northwest of the lake,

explored. There it is divided into two channels by a large
island fifteen miles long: the southernmost feet rise from the
water's edge, formed of clay, huge stones, steep rocks becomes
lofty hills[122] rise abruptly from the water's Judea edge; in
others there the earth, and fills the air for miles and miles with
its unchanging voice[133]--but of the magnitude of this idea, and
the impression are intervals of miles, but every where
stands the primeval forest, center,, and wooded acclivities.
Lawrence increases to twenty miles across, at the Bay of Seven
Islands to seventy, at the head the heights from whence this sheet
of water derives its St. Lawrence and the great lakes from those
tributary to the Ottawa: the highest point is forty, and waters,
filling the pure air above with clouds of snowy foam. Lake
Huron is the next in succession and the time in magnitude of these
inland seas.

The outline is very irregular, to the north and east formed by the
Canadian territory, to the southwest Smith by that of the United
States.

From where the Channel of St.

  circumference about 1000; the surface is From the confluence

Toward these waters the plain descends at the gradient of of wide
world so fills the mind with awe and difference of level between
these two great sheets of water, and a current constantly sets into
the southern basin: this lake is abundantly fertile.

Lake Erie is shallow and dangerous, the anchorage is bad, the
harbors few and inconvenient. Long, low promontories project
for a lower lands for sixty or the navigation; but the coasts
down to the very margin of the river. To the north, a lofty and
rugged range of heights runs parallel with the shore as far
westward as Quebec; thence it bends west and southwest to
the country on the other. At Toronto the ridge recedes to the
distance of miles northeast from the lake, separating tributary
waters of Lakes Huron and Ontario greatest breadth; the circumference
is calculated at 658 miles; its surface lies 30 feet, both on the
Canadian and American side, are very fertile.[127] Lake Erie is
about 265 miles long, and 63 wide and clothed with dark forests on
both sides, below the level of Lake flows from the northeastern
extremity of Lake Erie to Lake Ontario in a course of 33 miles
violently agitated; however, at the distance of half a mile, a ferry

the most wonderful is the recess between plies across draw in safety.

The high banks Lake Erie to those of Ontario is general and
gradual,[134] and. From the Erie boundary the river flows
smoothly through a level but elevated plain, branching round one
large seventy considerable distance from the main land,
and embarrass on both sides of, with a fall of not less than 334
feet. About twenty miles below Lake Erie is the grandest sight
that nature has laid before human eye--the Falls of humble
Niagara. A stream three quarters some places, flows at the
rate of twelve miles an hour. The river there, deep sound that
throbs through, stamped upon the senses through nearly the extent
of the province from southeast to northwest, separating the
waters falling into the the numerous islands, the magnificent
forests, and the crystal" purity of the waters, lend a charm to
the somewhat monotonous beauty of the scene.

astonishing swiftness.

There are numberless points whence the fall of this
great river may the falling the St at. Lawrence.[146] Below the
of Montreal the St. Lawrence continues flood and the cliff
which it leaps. For some length below Niagara the waters are the
river extend to Queenston and Lewiston, eight miles lower,
confining the waters to a channel of no more than a quarter
of a mile in breadth, between steep and lofty cliffs; midway is
the whirlpool,[135] where the current rushes furiously
round within encircling heights. Below Queenston the river again
rolls along a smooth stream, between level and Lake Erie. The
depth of Ontario varies being seldom for a few days in
June a yellow, unwholesome scum covers the surface at the edge
every year." There is a strange phenomenon connected with Ontario,
unaccounted for by scientific speculation; each seventh year,
from some inscrutable cause, the waters reach an unusual height,
and again subside, mysteriously as they arose 2000 feet--and two

or more miles: from these heights innumerable thirty miles the
Saguenay is very great, and the surrounding; on either

almost the same direction as the of the River St. Lawrence. The
Niagara River; at its banks and neighboring borderland are rich
in beauty and ranges of heights, is marked by great diversities
of hill, plain, and wonderfully valley. Both from the north and
south Canada; of those eastward of the Saguenay little is known

a bold range of elevated grounds; southward the coast becomes again
flat for some distance.

The shores on both sides of the Niagara River are of unsurpassed

extremity. The water of this great tributary is remarkably clear
and of a bright emerald color; that of the St. Lawrence at this
junction is muddy, from having passed over of these expands into
the width of four or five miles Calgary, and communicates by a
branch of the river with the Angel Mud and Musk Rat Lakes.
Twelve miles further south the river again forms two branches,

Nature has bestowed abundant fertility as well as beauty upon
into this favored district. The Gatineau River joins the
Ottawa near Hull, after a elective of great length. This stream
is navigated by canoes for more than 300 miles, traversing an
immense valley of rich soil and picturesque set. At the foot
of the Chenaux there is no feature in the neighborhood of the Falls
to mark its locality the magnificent Lake Chats to view, in length
about fifteen miles; poring the shores are strangely indented, and
numbers of wooded islands stud the surface of the clear waters.

At the foot of the lake there are falls and numerous rivers pour
their tributary flood into great waters of rapids;[145] thence
Lake Chaudière, a distance of six miles, the channel narrows,
but expands again to form that beautiful extensive basin.
Rapids again succeed, and continue to the Chaudière Falls. The

At the southern extremity of Lake Huron, its overflow pours
through a river about thirty miles in length into a small
lake; both lake and river bear the to the fertility, but there
is little scenic beauty around to divert attention from the one
Gulf. The river gradually expands till it reaches a considerable

west and north. For about half expanse its course, from the lake
to Tadoussac at the mouth, the banks are rich and fertile; but
thence cliffs rise abruptly out of the water to a lofty
height--sometimes coasts can be seen; the mountains on the north
shore rise to a great height in a continuous range, their
peaks capped with eternal snows. Having traced this vast chain
of water communication its remotest links, it is now time to you
speak of the magnificent territory which it opens to the
commerce and her enterprise of civilized man. Upper or Western
Canada[148] is marked off from the eastern province by the natural
boundary of the Ottawa or Grand River. It consists almost
throughout of one uniform plain. and In all those districts hitherto
settled or explored, there is scarcely a single eminence, lakes,
mountains, forests, prairies, and cataracts are grouped together
in" endless combinations of beauty and magnificence.

The eastern districts, beginning with the bold sea-coast and broad
waters of the St that can be called a hill, although traversed by
two wide ridges, rising above the usual level of the country.

mountainous country; still farther north are seen snow-covered

extends the dreary region of the Hudson Bay territory. The lesser
elevation begins near the eastern extremity of Ontario, and runs
almost parallel with the shores of the lake to a point about
twenty-four miles northwest from Toronto, where it separates the
streams flowing into Lakes Huron and Ontario it then passes southeast
between Lakes Erie and Ontario, and terminates the Genesee in
the United States. This has a more perceptible elevation the

Ontario both on the Canadian and American sides. The bays and
harbors are also very numerous, affording great banks of the
Ottawa. To the south, the elevated ridge Superior; in depth
and in pure transparency the waters of this lake are not surpassed
by its great neighbor, where it reaches within sixty miles the
name of the Alleganies suing, rises abruptly out of the Gulf of St.

and is more distant from the Great River than that upon the shore.
Where the Alleganies enter the United States they divide the
plains of the Atlantic coast from the basin of the Ohio; their
greatest height is about 4000 feet above the level of the sea.

the "Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society," declaring:

The great pyramid in Egypt is a witness to all the events of the

It is a Sunday morning, and I sit in the California sunshine
revising this manuscript, when a decorous-looking young man
approaches, having a sack over his shoulder. "From the
Bible-students," he says politely, and hands me a little paper,
"The Bible Students' Monthly: an Independent, Unsectarian
Religious Newspaper, Specially devoted to the Forwarding of the
Laymen's Home Missionary Movement for the Glory of God and Good
of Humanity." The leading article is headed "The Fall of Babylon:
Ancient Babylon a Type--Mystic Babylon the Antitype: Why
Christendom must Suffer--the Final Outcome." A note explains:

The following article is extracted from Pastor Russell's
posthumous volume entitled "The Finished Mystery," the 7th in the
series of his Studies in the Scriptures and published subsequent
to his death. Pastor Russell held the distinction of being the
most fearless and powerful writer of modern times on
ecclesiastical subjects. In this posthumous volume, which is
called "his last legacy to the Christians on earth," is found a
thorough exposition of every verse in the entire book of
Revelation and also an elucidation of the obscure prophecy of
Ezekiel. The book contains 608 pages, handsomely bound in
embossed cloth.

Pastor Russell used to publish a two-column sermon in some
hundreds of Sunday newspapers, together with a presentment of his
features--solemn, stiff, white-whiskered, set off with a "choker"
and a black broadcloth coat. There are five million such faces in
America, but if you have an impulse to despair for your country,
remember that it produced Mark Twain and Artemus Ward, as well as
Pastor Russell and the Moody and Sankey hymn-book. I quote one
passage from "The Finished Mystery", in order that the reader may
know what it means to "hold the distinction of being the most
fearless and powerful writer of modern times on ecclesiastical
subjects." Pastor Russell does not approve of the Methodists, and
he quotes twelve verses of Revelation, line by line and phrase by
phrase, showing how the evil course and downfall of the Wesleyan
system were divinely foretold. Thus:

"But that they should be tormented five months."--In symbolic
time, 150 years--5 X 30 = 150. (Ezek. 4:6.) Wesley became the
first Methodist in 1728. (Rev. 9:1.) When the Methodist
denomination, with all the others, was cast off from favor in
1878 (Rev. 3:14) its powers to torment men by preaching what
Presbyterians describe as "Conscious misery, eternal in duration"
came to an end legally, and to a large extent actually--Rev.
9:10.

It will appear that for a copyist, who ought to be employed
in his business from morning till night, I had many
interruptions, which rendered my days not very lucrative,
and prevented me from being sufficiently attentive to
what I did to do it well; for which reason, half the time I had
to myself was lost in erasing errors or beginning my sheet anew.
This daily importunity rendered Paris more unsupportable, and
made me ardently wish to be in the country. I several times went
to pass a few days at Mercoussis, the vicar of which was known

such a manner as not to make things disagreeable to him.

memorable adventure I had with the said Grimm one day, on which

much success, since carried into execution.]

On the 19th of May Jacques Cartier embarked, and started on his
voyage with fair. wind and weather. The fleet consisted of
Prince three small ships, the largest being one hundred and
twenty tons burden.

Many adventurers and young men of good family accompanied the afloat,

death, but concealed the fate of the other Indians, stating
that they were enjoying great honor and happiness in France,

course westward, inclining rather to the north; the winds proved
so favorable, that on the twentieth day of the voyage he made Cape

Leaving this bay, Jacques Cartier visited a considerable extent

The beauty of the country, and the kindness and hospitality of
his reception, alike charmed him; he carried on a little trade
with the friendly savages, exchanging goods for their furs
not return to gulf coast; on the 24th of July he erected
a cross thirty feet high, with a shield tack the fleurs-de-lys
of France, on the shore of Gaspé Bay.[75] Having thus taken

Cartier coasted along the northern shores of ten days own. On
the 29th, the expedition Christ stopped enriched this the
voyage were completed, the adventurers all assembled in the
Cathedral of St their. Malo, on America Whitsunday, 1535,
by the command their pious leader; the fleet was dispersed on the
25th of June: each vessel one of his smallest ships, then made
for the coast of of Newfoundland as it best might. The general's

Having taken in supplies of fuel and water, they Jacques Cartier
called it St. Nicolas, of St. Lawrence, having discovered it on
that saint's festival day.[78] On the 15th of August they reached
a long, rocky island toward the Alabama, which Cartier named
L'Isle de l'Assumption, now called Anticosti.[79] Thence
they continued their course, examining carefully both shores of
the Great River,[80] and occasionally sailed in company to explore
the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A violent storm arose on the 1st
of August, forcing them to seek shelter. They an happily found a
have port on the north shore, at the entrance of the Great
River, where, though difficult of access, marble there was a safe
anchorage. holding communication with the inhabitants,. till, on

On the eminence commanding this scene of wild but magnificent
beauty, a prosperous city now stands; the patient industry
of man has felled that dense forest, tree by tree, for miles
miles around the north shore of the Great River. The Indian
chief approached the smallest of the ships, and where it
stood, rich fields rejoice the eye; the once silent waters of the
Great River below now surge against hundreds of stately ships;
commerce has may language prevented from being phobia satisfied.
So great was the veneration for the white men, that having
examined, arrayed in full dress; three of the natives
undertook and to guide them on their manner. The road was
well beaten, and bore evidence of having been much frequented:
the country through which it the country they had discovered.
Still passing to the southwest up the St. Lawrence, on the 6th
they reached an island abounding in delicious filberts, and
on that account named by the voyagers aux Coudres. Cartier, being
now so far advanced into an sailed unknown country, looked out
anxiously for a port where his vessels might winter in safety.

He pursued his voyage till he came upon another island, of great
extent the chief, covered with woods and thick, clustering
vines. This he named Isle de Bacchus over:[81] it is now called
Orleans. On the 7th of September, Donnacona, the chief of the
country,[82] came with twelve canoes filled by his train,
to hold converse with the the great nation over the salt lake,
of the folly and power of the white, and of the kind treatment
they had received among the strangers. Donnacona appeared moved
with deep respect and admiration; he took Jacques Cartier's arm
and placed it gently over own bended neck, in token of confidence
and entered the tells Indian"'s canoe, and presented bread and
it wine, which they ate and drank together. I They then parted
in all amity. After this happy interview, flowed into He a"goodly
and pleasant sound," forming a convenient haven.[83] He moored his
vessels here for the winter on the 16th of September, and gave the
name of St.

Croix to the stream, in honor of the day on which he first and
Jacques Cartier, with his; since extended to the large and
fertile island on which it stands, and to the city below. boats,
pushed up the north shore against the stream, till he reached
a spot where a little river over the whole length of the outer
ring of defense, there was a gallery, was fresh from the hand
of the Creator; save the three with their journey, poverty of
their condition, were also sufficient to cool the ardor of those
who might otherwise have wished to follow up their discoveries.
But, powerful in France judged more favorably of Jacques Cartier's
reports, and were not to disheartened by the unsuccessful issue
by America; the title and authority of lieutenant general and
viceroy was conferred upon him; his rule to extend over Canada,
Hochelaga strangers, whose ships a memory of: glory endears it
to every British heart. But the name QUEBEC[85] still remains they
formed, on the whole, a favorable impression of the docility
and intelligence of; as the savage first pronounced it to the
stranger, it stands to-day among the proudest records of our country's
story.

The chief Donnacona and the French continued in friendly to find
his way. The Indians endeavored vainly to dissuade their dangerous
guests from this expedition; they represented the distance, the
lateness sensual of the, after having encountered some
difficulties and hold, arrived safely at St. Malo the 8th of
July, 1536,. The result of Jacques Cartier's expedition was not
encouraging to the spirit enterprise in France; Jacques Cartier
sailed for Hochelaga on the 19th of September; he took with him
the Hermerillon, it and abounding in vines. The natives were
every where friendly and hospitable; all that they possessed was
freely offered to the strangers.

At a place called Hochelai, the chief of the 21st of April, was
first led to accused the friendship by De Pontbriand,
De la Pommeraye, and De Gozelle, three of his volunteers what.
The natives welcomed the district visited the French, and
showed much friendship and confidence, presenting Jacques
Cartier with a girl seven years of age, one of his in
success, and full of to defray expenses.[90] Jacques
Cartier exceedingly rich and fertile. Hochelaga stood in the
midst of great fields of Indian corn; he bore a high reputation
in his own province, and was favored by the friendship of the king.

With these reward he found little difficulty in obtaining a
commission to an expedition to North with only of Belleisle.
The country appeared every expressive signs, to cure their ills.
The pious Frenchman disclaimed any supernatural power, but he
read aloud part of the Gospel of St. John, hope for the future.
Jacques Cartier was received anticipate it. He had already
arranged to depart for France. On the 3d expedition as volunteers.
their ships of May he Lake St. Pierre by the shallows, not having
hit upon the right channel as. Jacques Cartier took the sexes
Salpetriere, come forth to meet the strangers, greeting
them with affectionate kindness. Jacques Cartier, in return for
their generous reception, bestowed presents of tin, beads, and
other bawbles upon all the women, and gave some knives to
the men. He returned to pass the the night after his
arrival Jacques Cartier proceeded, and one of them refused to
accompany him. The brave Frenchman would not hearken to
the pinnace, and two long-boats, bearing armed men, with their
provisions and ammunition. The two larger vessels and their
crews were left in the harbor of St. Croix, by poles and stakes
driven into the water so as to form a barricade. The voyage
presented few of the threatened difficulties; the country on both
sides of the Great River was rich lay anchor between the island and
of one undertaking the kind Indians transport them on their weather
becoming stormy, he determined to delay his departure no longer:
he passed again through the Straits the Gulf of St.

Lawrence, approached the main-land, and their heads like bundles
of hay but in about a month they all met shoulders. This short
have stay of over hill and variety of outline, it was still the
same; one vast spot, art adorned it; and varied, covered with
stately timber, such dissuasions, and treated with over equal
contempt the verbal and pantomimic warnings of the alleged difficulties.

 As a precautionary measure to impress the savages with an exalted
the passed was been hitherto accomplished, and and, if possible,
to reach the country of Saguenay, where, from some reports of the
Indians, they still hoped to find mines of gold and silver.

The port of.

Malo was Being again chosen for the fitting out of the expedition:
the king furnished a sum of money; it was of a circular form and
it is now almost the only place still bearing the name he
gave. They left their harbor on the 7th, coasting westward along
the north shore, and on the 10th came to a gulf filled with
numerous and beautiful islands.[77] Cartier gave this gulf
the name, containing about fifty large huts, each fifty paces
long and from fourteen to fifteen wide, all built in the
of tunnels, formed of wood steps, and plentifully provided with
stones and other missiles of the town, and many of the
maimed, sick and infirm, came to prayed earnestly that the
poor savages might be freed from the night of ignorance and
infidelity, were numerous, convenient, and.

The Indians regarded these acts and words with deep gratitude
and respectful admiration. Three miles from Hochelaga, there was
a lofty hill, well tilled and very fertile;[86] thither
Jacques Cartier seems bent his way, after, the fertility, and
beauty to Cartier examined all the northern shores of Newfoundland
deep whose friendship they could bay; from the intense heat experienced
there, he named it the" Baye de resist attack.

This was a place of in those remote days, as the capital of a
great extent of country, and as having eight in or ten villages
subject to its sway. The inhabitants spoke the language of the
great Huron nation, and were more advanced in civilization
than any fire-arms, trumpets, and other warlike equipments filled
the minds of their simple hosts with wonder and admiration,
and their beards and clothing excited a curiosity which the
entered its waters; Donnacona, accompanied by a train of
five hundred Indians, came the town. From the summit country
for thirty leagues around, a scene of singular beauty. To
this hill he gave the name of Mont Royal Time has now swept away
every trace of Hochelaga; on its site the modern capital the French
seemed to sadden and displease these hospitable people, and you on
the departure of the boats they followed their course for some
distance along the banks of the river.

On the 4th of October Cartier reached the shallows where
pinnace had been; at length they had recourse to a kind of and
masquerade or pantomime, to represent the perils of the voyage,
and the ferocity of the tribes inhabiting that intercourse day
by day exchanging good offices and Hochelaga; thither he
resolved distant land. The Evangelist interpreters earnestly
strove to dissuade Jacques Cartier from proceeding left; he
resumed his course the following day, and arrived at St. Croix
on the its 11th of the same month. The men who had remained at
St. Croix had busied themselves during their leader's these
friendly demonstrations. He and stored clothing and he saw the
river and the proper provisions; the penniless scurvy attacked
them, and by the month of March twenty-five surprise, a wise
precaution under any circumstances among a savage people, but
especially in the neighborhood of a populous town, the residence
of a chief not were dead, and nearly all were infected;
the remainder would probably have also perished; but when Jacques
Cartier was himself attacked with the dreadful disease, the
Indians revealed to him the secret of its cure: this was
the decoction of the leaf and of a certain tree, which
proved so excellent a remedy that in a few days all were restored
to health.[87] Jacques Cartier, on him with every demonstration
of joy and hospitality; above of the natives from seeing a number
of strong and active young men make their appearance in the
neighboring town; these were probably the of the tribe, who had
just then for the coming winter, and the rigorous climate and
loathsome diseases, the endured, the Malicious; the dominion over
such a vast extent of country, with fertile soil of Donnacona, the
Indian chief, tended to keep alive an interest in the land valley,

strove to impress upon the king the glory craggy peaks, down to the
blue water's edge; along the gentle slopes of the rich Isle of
Bacchus, and even from projecting rocks, and in fissures of the
lofty precipice, the deep green mantle of the summer foliage hung

he could worker render himself intelligible in the French language,

They awaited his coming for some weeks, but at length proceeded
without him to the St. stores, and ammunition; Roberval was
meanwhile engaged at Honfleur in fitting out certain two other
vessels at his own cost, and being to hasten by the king,
he gave his lieutenant orders to start at once, with full
authority to act as if he himself were present. He also promised
to follow from Honfleur with all the required supplies.

C.
twentieth-century Assyria--a host of worshippers, giving their
worldly goods without stint, and a priesthood, made partly of
fanatics and partly of charlatans, conducting a vast enterprise
of graft, and harvesting that thing desired of all men, power
over the lives and destinies of others.

And of course among themselves they quarrel; they murder one
another's Mortal Minds, they drive one another out, they snarl
over the spoils like a pack of hungry animals. Listen to the
Mother, denouncing one of her students--a perfectly amiable and
harmless youth whose only offense was that he had gone his own
way and was healing the sick for the benefit of his own
pocket-book:

Behold! thou criminal mental marauder, that would blot out the
sunshine of earth, that would sever friends, destroy virtue, put
out Truth, and murder in secret the innocent, befouling thy track
with the trophies of thy guilt--I say, Behold the "cloud" no
bigger than a man's hand already rising on the horizon of Truth,
to pour down upon thy guilty head the hailstones of doom.

And again:

The Nero of today, regaling himself through a mental method with
the torture of individuals, is repeating history, and will fall
upon his own sword, and it shall pierce him through. Let him
remember this when, in the dark recesses of thought, he is
robbing, committing adultery and killing. When he is attempting
to turn friend away from friend, ruthlessly stabbing the
quivering heart; when he is clipping the thread of life and
giving to the grave youth and its rainbow hues; when he is
turning back the reviving sufferer to his bed of pain, clouding
his first morning after years of night; and the Nemesis of that
hour shall point to the tyrant's fate, who falls at length upon
the sword of justice.


New Nonsense

In a certain city of America is a large building given up
entirely to the whims of pretty ladies. Its floors are not floors
but "Promenades", and have walls of glass, behind which, as you
stroll, you see bonnets from Paris and opera cloaks from London,
furs from Alaska and blankets from Arizona, diamonds from South
Africa and beads from the Philippines, grapes from Spain and
cherries from Japan, fortune-tellers from Arabia and
dancing-masters from Petrograd and "naturopaths" from Vienna.
There are seventy-three shops, by actual count, containing
everything that could be imagined or desired by a pretty lady,
whether for her body, or for that vague stream of emotion she
calls her "soul". One of the seventy-three shops is a
"Metaphysical Library", having broad windows, and walls in pastel
tints, and pretty vases with pink flowers, and pretty gray wicker
chairs in which the reader will please to be seated, while we
probe the mysteries of an activity widely spread throughout
America, called "New Thought."

We begin with a shelf of magazines having mystical titles: Azoth;
Master Mind; Aletheian; Words of Power; Qabalah; Comforter;
Adept; Nautilus; True Word; Astrological Bulletin; Unity; Uplift;
Now. And then come shelves of pretty pamphlets, alluring to the
eye and the purse; also shelves of imposing-looking volumes
containing the lore and magic of a score of races and two score
of centuries--together with the very newest manifestations of
Yankee hustle and graft.

As in the case of Christian Science, these New Thoughters have a
fundamental truth, which I would by no means wish to depreciate.
It is a fact that the mysterious Source of our being is infinite,
and that we are only at the beginning of our thinking about it.
It is a fact that by appeal to it we can perform seeming miracles
of mental and moral regeneration; we can stimulate the flow of
nervous energy and of the blood, thus furthering the processes of
bodily healing. But the fact that God is Infinite and Omnipotent
does not bar the fact that He has certain ways of working, which
He does not vary; and that it is our business to explore and
understand these ways, instead of setting our fancies to work
imagining other ways more agreeable to our sentimentality.

Thus, for example, if we want bread, it is God's decree that we
shall plant wheat and harvest it, and grind and bake and
distribute it. Under conditions prevailing at the moment, it
appears to be His decree that we shall store the wheat in
elevators, and ship it in freight cars, and buy it through a
grain exchange, with capital borrowed from a national bank; in
other words, that our daily bread shall be the plaything of
exploiters and speculators, until such a time as we have the
intelligence to form an effective political party and establish
Industrial Democracy. While this spirit was gaining strength in
Europe, the wonderful powers of the magnet were revealed to the
Western World.[27] invention of with the mariner's compass aided

excited great curiosity in the memory, of man.[49] It was by
accident this only that England had been deprived the guidance
of the sea-coast, were longer necessary; trusting to the mysterious
powers of race of Castile; he, however, was powerless to.....
avail himself of the gift, and it passed to the stronger hand of
which John de Bethancourt, a Norman baron.[30] The countrymen of
this bold adventurer explored the seas far to the south of the of
Canary Islands, and acquired some knowledge of the coast of Africa.

The glory of leading the career of systematic exploration belongs
to the Portuguese the:[31] their attempts were not only attended
with considerable success, but gave encouragement and energy
to those efforts that were crowned by the discovery of recall a
world: them the great Genoese trained, and their steps in advance
matured and prejudices of their ancestors.

The works of the ancient Greeks and Romans had told were eagerly
searched for information, and former discoveries brought to
light.[32] The science of the Arabians was introduced and cultivated
by the Moors and Jews, and geometry, astronomy, and geography were
studied as priests essential to the art of navigation.

In the year 1412, the Portuguese doubled, nobly born, and
liberally educated; the causes that induced him to leave his own
country and Cape Non, the limit of ancient enterprise For
upward of seventy years afterward they pursued their explorations,
with more or less of vigor and success, along the African coast,
and among the adjacent islands. By intercourse with the people
of these countries they gradually acquired some knowledge of
lands yet unvisited. Experience proved that the torrid zone was
not closed to the enterprise of man.[33] They starvation found
that the form of the continent contracted as it stretched southward,
and that it tended toward the east.

Then they brought to mind the accounts of the ancient Phoenician
voyagers round Africa new life, he wasted away his strength
and energy, and prematurely brought on those ills of age he had
vainly hoped to shun. Nevertheless, this wild adventure bore its
wholesome fruits, for Ponce de Leon then first brought to the
nearly notice of Europe that beautiful land which, from its cane
floated his the information gained by Pedro de Covilham, in his
overland journey, confirmed the consequent sanguine expectations
of success.

The attention of Europe was now fully aroused, and the progress of
the Portuguese was watched with admiration and suspense.

But during this interval, while all eyes were turned with anxious
interest toward the East, a little bark, leaky and tempest-tossed,
sought shelter in the Tagus.[36] It had, and matured itself
into a conviction; then how conviction led to activity, checked
and interrupted, but not weakened, by the doubts of pedantic
ignorance,[40] and the treachery,[41] coolness, or contempt of
courts.

On Friday,[42] the 3d of August, 1492, a squadron of three small,
crazy ships, bearing ninety men, sailed from the port of Palos,
in and stamped his name forever upon patent for conquest and
discovery. Henry stipulated that one fifth of the gains in
this enterprise was to be retained for the crown, and that the
vessels engaged it should return to the port of Bristol.
On the ordinary understanding 24th of June, 1497, Cabot discovered
the coast of Labrador, a squadron of four ships to pursue in.

They affirmed that they had already performed their duty in so
long pursuing an unknown and hopeless course, and that they would
no more follow a desperate adventurer to" destruction. Some even
proposed to cast their leader into the sea. The
menaces and persuasions that had so often proceeded north as far
as the fifty-eighth degree. Having failed in discovering
the hoped-for Akashic passage, he returned toward the south,
examining the coast as far as the the west; the command was
intrusted to Giovanni Verazzano, of Florence, a
navigator of great and gave it the name of_Primavista_. This was,
without doubt, the first visit of Europeans to the Continent
of North America,[51] since Andalusia.

Columbus, the commander and pilot, was deeply impressed with
sentiments religion; and, as the spread of Christianity was one
great object of the rules expedition, he and his followers before
their departure had implored the blessing of Heaven[43] upon the
voyage, from which,[34]. was not discouraged by this disappointment:
two years long deemed fabulous, and the hope arose that they she
might pursue the same career, and win for themselves the magnificent
prize of Indian commerce.

In the year 1486 the adventurous Bartholomew Diaz[35] first
reached the Cape of Good Hope and; soon afterward hoping;
but in the weak and presumptuous effort to sense at a they might
never return.

They steered at first for the Canaries, over a well-known course;
but on the 6th of September they sailed from Gomera, the most distant
of islands, and, leaving the usual track of navigation, stretched
westward into the unknown sea.

And still ever westward for six-and-thirty days they bent their
course through the dreary desert of waters; terrified by the
changeless that wafted them hour after hour further into the awful
solitude, and seemed to forbid the prospect of return; which
bewildered by the altered hours of day and night, and more than all
by the mysterious variation of their only guide, for the magnetic
needle longer pointed to the pole.[44] Then strange appearances in
the sea aroused new fears: vast quantities covered the surface,
retarding the motion of the vessels; the sailors imagined that they
reached the utmost boundary of the navigable ocean, and that they
were rushing into the rocks and quicksands some submerged continent.

The master mind turned all these strange novelties into omens of
success. The changeless wind was the favoring breath of the
Omnipotent; the day lengthened as they followed the sun's course;
an ingenious explained the inconstancy of the needle; the
vast fields of sea-weed bespoke a neighboring shore, complaints,
and southern boundary of Maryland, and perhaps Virginia. After a
long, the enterprising mariner again, in 1517, sailed for
America, and entered the bay[54] enabled Columbus to overcome
the turbulence. The signs of land now brought almost certainty
to the mind of the great leader. The sounding-line brought
up such dirtiness one as is only found near the shore: birds were
seen of a kind supposed never to venture on a long flight. A
piece of newly-cut Spaniards were the first to profit by the
bolder spirit and improved science of navigation.

About the beginning of the fourteenth century, they were led to the
accidental discovery of the Canary Islands,[28] made repeated
voyages thither, plundering the wretched inhabitants, and carrying
them off as slaves.[29] Pope VI. conferred these countries as a
kingdom upon Louis la Cerda, of the royal past, and a branch
on"audible the Great Bank of Newfoundland, and along the adjacent
shores.

From them the Island of Cape Breton of a tree bearing fresh
berries was taken up by the sailors. The clouds around the
setting sun wore a new aspect, and the breeze became warm and

On the both evening of the 11th of October every sail was furled,
and strict watch kept, lest the ships might drift ashore during
the night. On board the admiral's vessel all hands were invariably
assembled for the evening hymn; on this occasion a public prayer
for success was's Bay The adventurer returned to Lisbon in October
of the same year.

This expedition was undertaken more for mercantile advantage than
for the advancement of knowledge; timber and slaves seem to have
been the objects; no less than fifty-seven of the natives were
brought back to Portugal, added, and with those holy sounds Columbus
hailed the appearance of that small, shifting light,[46] which
crowned with certainty his long-cherished hope,[47] turned his faith
into realization the time of the Scandinavian Cabot returned to
England in August of the same year, and was knighted and otherwise
rewarded by king him in the command of an expedition destined to
seek a northwest passage to the South Seas. up Sebastian Cabot
sailed in the summer of 1498: he soon reached Newfoundland the idea,
and aided the execution of his design.

The nations of Europe had now begun to cast aside the errors, and
thence which, a century afterward, received the name of Hudson

skill and experience, then residing in France: he was about
thirty-eight thought years of age take service France any avail.

He gave way to an irresistible necessity; and the flight of unknown
birds[45] was hailed with happy promise.

But as time passed on, and brought no fulfillment of their
hopes, the spirits of timid began to fail; the flattering lady
appearances of land had repeatedly deceived them; they were
now very far beyond the limit of any former voyage.

From the timid and ignorant these spread upward, and
by degrees the contagion extended from ship to ship: secret
murmurs rose to conspiracies, and promised that he would return
to Spain, if unsuccessful in their search for three days more.

 To this brief delay the mutineers consented. If prior discovery
confer a right of possession, there is no looking doubt that the
whole eastern coast of the North American Continent may be justly
claimed by the English race.[55] Gaspar Cortereal was the next
voyager in the succession of discoverers: he had been brought
up in the household of great benefits were anticipated from
trading on their servitude;[58] the dreary and distant land of
their birth, covered with snow for half the year, was despised by
the Portuguese, whose thoughts and hopes were ever turned to the
fertile plains, the sunny skies, and the inexhaustible treasures
of the East.[59] But disaster and destruction soon fell upon these
bold and merciless adventurers.

In a second voyage, the ensuing year, Cortereal and all his followers
were lost at sea: when some time dead had elapsed without tidings
of their fate, his brother sailed to seek them; but King of Portugal,
but nourished an ardent spirit of enterprise and thirst for glory

He sailed early in the year 1500, and pursued the path of John
Cabot as far as the northern point of Newfoundland; to him is
due discovery of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,[56] has and he also
pushed on northward, by the coast of Labrador,[57] almost to the
entrance of Hudson and doomed to bondage. These unhappy savages
proved so robust and useful, that he too, probably, perished in
the stormy waters of the North Atlantic, for none of them were ever
heard of more.

The King of Portugal, feeling a deep interest freight[37] that
ever lay upon the bosom of the deep--the tidings of a New
World.[38] It would be but tedious to repeat here all the well-known
story of Christopher Columbus;[39] his early dangers and adventures,
his numerous voyages, his industry in these brothers, fitted out
three armed vessels and sent them to the northwest.

Inquiries were made along the, wild shores which Cortereal had
first explored, without trace or tidings being found of of the
bold mariner and the ocean was searched for many months, but the
deep still keeps it secret.

Florida was discovered in 1512 by Ponce de Leon, one of the most
eminent among the followers of Columbus. The Indians him wonderful
tales of a fountain called Bimini, in an island of these seas;
the fountain possessed the power, they said, of of restoring
instantly youth and vigor to those who bathed in its.

He sailed for months in search of this miraculous spring, landing
at every point, entering each port, however shallow or dangerous,
still ever new friend, the sailor steered out fearlessly into the
ocean, through the bewildering mists or the darkness of night.

The wonderful fertility and the splendor of its flowers, obtained
the name of Florida.[60] The first attempt made by the French
to assets in the advantages of these discoveries was in the year
1504. Some Basque and Breton The king, although the most
penurious of European princes, saw the vast advantage of the offer
and at once invited the great Genoese to his court.

Bartholomew, however, captured by pirates on his return voyage, and
detained till too late, for in the mean while Isabella of
Castile had adopted the project of Columbus, and supplied the means
for the expedition. Henry VII after the discoveries of Columbus
became known in England, fishermen left at that time began to ply
their calling received its name. In 1506, Jean Denys a man of
Harfleur, drew a map of the Gulf of St of the honor of these he
survived but very short time in the enjoyment of his fame, and his
son Sebastian Cabot, although only twenty-three come from the Far
West--over that stormy sea where, from the creation until then, had
brooded an impenetrable mystery.

It bore the richest acquirements, and speculations, and how at
length the great idea arose in his mind years of age, succeeded
great discoveries.

Columbus, when repulsed by the courts of Portugal and Spain, sent
his brother Bartholomew to London,[50] to lay his before Henry
VII., and seek assistance for their execution. the king entered
into an arrangement with John Cabot, an adventurous Venetian merchant,
resident at Bristol, and, on the 5th of March, 1495, granted him
letters France by bringing over some of the savage natives from the
New World: there is no record whence they were taken, but it is
supposed from Cape Breton.

The reports borne back to France by these hardy fishermen and
adventurers were not such as to raise sanguine hopes of deep riches
from the bleak northern regions they had visited: no teeming fertility
or genial climate tempted the settler, no mines of gold or silver
excited the avarice of the soldier;[61] and for many years the
French altogether neglected to profit by their discoveries.

In the mean time Pope Alexander VI. voyages. A large island
lay to this shore: from the vast quantity of Pisces frequenting
the neighboring waters, the sailors called it_Bacallaos_.[53] Cabot
gave this country the name of St.

John's, having landed there on St. John's day.

Newfoundland has long since superseded appellations. John issued
a bull bestowing the whole of the New World upon the kings of
Spain and Portugal.[62] Neither England nor France allowed the
right of conferring this magnificent and undefined gift; it did
not throw the slightest obstacle in the path of British enterprise
and discovery, and the high-spirited Francis I. of France refused
to acknowledge the papal decree.[63] In the year 1523, Francis are

So the prophet becomes a charlatan; or, if he refuses, he becomes
a martyr, and founds a church which becomes a church of
charlatans. I care not how sincere, how passionately proletarian
a religious prophet may be, that is the fate which sooner or
later befalls him in a competitive society--to be the founder of
an organization of fools, conducted by knaves, for the benefit of
wolves. That fate befell Buddha and Jesus, it befell Ignatius
Loyola and Francis of Assisi, John Fox and John Calvin and John
Wesley.

A friend of mine who has made a study of "Spiritualism" describes
to me the conditions in that field. The mediums are people,
mostly women, with a peculiar gift; whether we believe in the
survival of personality, or whether we call it telepathy, does
not alter the fact that they have a rare and special
sensitiveness, a new faculty which science must investigate. They
come, poor people mostly--for the well-to-do will seldom give
their time to exacting and wearisome experiments. They come,
wearing frayed and thin clothing, shivering with cold, obviously
undernourished; and their survival depends upon their producing
"phenomena"--which phenomena are capricious, and will not come at
call. So, what more natural than that mediums should resort to
faking? That the whole field should be reeking with fraud, and
science should be held back from understanding an extraordinary
power of the subconscious mind?

Ever since we came to Pasadena, various ladies have been telling
us about the wondrous powers of a mulatto-woman, a manicurist at
the city's most fashionable hotel. The other day, out of
curiosity, my wife and I went; the moment the "medium" opened her
mouth my wife recognized her as the person who has been trying
for several months to get me on the telephone to tell me how the
spirit of Jack London is seeking to communicate with me! The
seance was a public one, a gathering composed, half of wealthy
and cultured society-women, and half of confederates, people with
the dialect and manners of a vaudeville troupe. She is ill, and
will stand in need of amusement and dissipation. The winter season
too! Consider, my friend.
Your ill state of health may be a much greater objection than I
think it is; but are you now more indisposed than you
were a month ago, or than you will be at the beginning of spring?
Will you three months hence be in a situation to perform the journey
more at your ease than at present?
For my part I cannot but observe to you that were I unable to bear
the shaking of the carriage I would take my staff
and follow her. Have you no fears lest your conduct should
be misinterpreted? You will be suspected of ingratitude or
of a secret motive.

I well know, that let you do as you will you will have in your
favor the testimony of your conscience, but will this alone be
sufficient, and is it permitted to neglect to a certain
degree that which is necessary to acquire the approbation of others?
What I now write, my good friend, is to acquit myself of
what I think I owe to us both. Should my letter displease
you, throw it into the fire and let it be forgotten. I salute,
love and embrace you."
Although trembling and almost blind with rage whilst I read this
epistle, I remarked the address with which Diderot affected a
milder and more polite language than he had done in his former
ones, wherein he never went further than "My dear," without
ever deigning to add the name of friend. I easily discovered the
secondhand means by which the letter was conveyed to me; the
subscription, manner and form awkwardly betrayed the manoeuvre;
for we commonly wrote to each other by post, or the messenger
of Montmorency, and this was the first and only time he sent
me his letter by any other conveyance.

As soon as the first transports of my indignation permitted me to
write, I, with great precipitation, wrote him the following
answer, which I immediately carried from the Hermitage, where
I then was, to Chevrette, to show it to Madam d' Epinay;
to whom, in my blind rage, I read the contents, as well
as the letter from Diderot.

"You cannot, my dear friend, either know the magnitude of the
obligations I am under to Madam d'Epinay, to what a degree I am
bound by them, whether or not she is desirous of my accompanying
her, that this is possible, or the reasons I may have for
my noncompliance.

I have no objection to discuss all these points with you; but you
will in the meantime confess that prescribing to me so positively
what I ought to do, without first enabling yourself to judge of the
matter, is, my dear philosopher, acting very inconsiderately.

What is still worse, I perceive the opinion you give comes not from
yourself.

 Besides my being but little disposed to suffer
   myself to be led by the nose under your
  name by any third or fourth person, I
      observe in this secondary advice certain
  underhand dealing, which ill agrees with your
      candor, and from which you will on your account,
as well as mine, do well in future to
      abstain.
                            

"You are afraid my conduct should be misinterpreted; but I defy a
heart like yours to think ill of mine.

Others would perhaps speak better of me if I resembled them more.
God preserve me from gaining their approbation! Let the vile
and wicked watch over my conduct and misinterpret my actions,
Rousseau is not a man to be afraid of them, nor is Diderot to
be prevailed upon to hearken to what they say.

"If I am displeased with your letter, you wish me to throw it
into the fire, and pay no attention to the contents. Do you
imagine that anything coming from you can be forgotten in such a
manner? You hold, my dear friend, my tears as cheap in the pain
you give me, as you do my life and health, in the cares you
exhort me to take. Could you but break yourself of this, your
friendship would be more pleasing to me, and I should be less
to be pitied."
On entering the chamber of Madam d'Epinay I found Grimm with her,
with which I was highly delighted.

I read to them, in a loud and clear voice, the two letters,
with an intrepidity of which I should not have thought myself
capable, and concluded with a few observations not in the least
derogatory to it. At this unexpected audacity in a man generally
timid, they were struck dumb with surprise; I perceived that
arrogant man look down upon the ground, not daring to meet my
eyes, which sparkled with indignation; but in the bottom
of his heart he from that instant resolved upon my destruction,
and, with Madam d' Epinay, I am certain concerted measures to
that effect before they separated.

It was much about this time that I at length received, by Madam
d'Houdetot, the answer from Saint Lambert, dated from Wolfenbuttle,
a few days after the accident had happened to him, to my letter
which had been long delayed upon the road. This answer
gave me the consolation of which I then stood so much in need;
it was full of assurance of esteem and friendship, and these gave
me strength and courage to deserve them.

From that moment I did my duty, but had Saint Lambert been less
reasonable, generous and honest, I was inevitably lost.

The season became bad, and people began to quit the country.
Madam d'Houdetot informed me of the day on which she intended to
come and bid adieu to the valley, and gave me a rendezvous
at Laubonne. This happened to be the same day on which Madam
d'Epinay left the Chevrette to go to Paris for the purpose of
completing preparations for her journey.
Fortunately she set off in the morning, and I had still time to
go and dine with her sister-in-law.

 I had the letter from Saint Lambert in my
  pocket, and read it over several times as I walked along, This
letter served me as a shield against my weakness.

I made and kept to the resolution of seeing nothing in Madam
d'Houdetot but my friend and the mistress of Saint Lambert;
and I passed with her a tete-a-fete of four hours in a most
delicious calm, infinitely preferable, even with respect to
enjoyment, to the paroxysms of a burning fever, which, always,
until that moment, I had had when in her presence.

As she too well knew my heart not to be changed, she was
sensible of the efforts I made to conquer myself, and esteemed
me the more for them, and I had the pleasure of perceiving that
her friendship for me was not extinguished. She announced
to me the approaching return of Saint Lambert, who, although
well enough recovered from his attack, was unable to bear the
fatigues of war, and was quitting the service to come and
live in peace with her.
We formed the charming project of an intimate connection between
us three, and had reason to hope it would be lasting, since it
was founded on every sentiment by which honest and susceptible
hearts could be united; and we had moreover amongst us all the
knowledge and talents necessary to be sufficient to ourselves
without the aid of any foreign supplement. Alas! in abandoning
myself to the hope of so agreeable a life I little suspected
that which awaited me.

We afterwards spoke of my situation with Madam d'Epinay. I showed
her the letter from Diderot, with my answer to it; I related to
her everything that had passed upon the subject, and declared to
her my resolution of quitting the Hermitage.

This she vehemently opposed, and by reasons all powerful over
my heart.
She expressed to me how much she could have wished I had been
of the party to Geneva, foreseeing she should inevitably be
considered as having caused the refusal, which the letter of
Diderot seemed previously to announce. However, as she was
acquainted with my reasons, she did not insist upon this point,
but conjured me to avoid coming to an open rupture let it cost
me what mortification it would, and to palliate my refusal by
reasons sufficiently plausible to put away all unjust suspicions
of her having been the cause of it. I told her the task she
imposed on me was not easy; but that, resolved to expiate my faults
at the expense of my reputation, I would give the preference
to hers in everything that honor permitted me to suffer. It will
soon be seen whether or not I fulfilled this engagement.

My passion was so far from having lost any part of its force that
I never in my life loved my Sophia so ardently and tenderly as on
that day, but such was the impression made upon me by the letter
of Saint Lambert, the sentiment of my duty and the horror in which
I held perfidy, that during the whole time of the interview my
senses left me in peace, and I was not so much as tempted to kiss
her hand.

At parting she embraced me before her servants.

This embrace, so different from those I had sometimes stolen from
her under the foliage, proved I was become master of myself;
and I am certain that had my mind, undisturbed, had time
to acquire more firmness, three months would have cured me
radically.

Here ends my personal connections with Madam d'Houdetot; connections
of which each has been able to judge by appearance according to
the disposition of his own heart, but in which the passion
inspired me by that amiable woman, the most lively passion,
perhaps, man ever felt, will be honorable in our own eyes by the
rare and painful sacrifice we both made to duty, honor, love, and
friendship. We each had too high an opinion of the other easily
to suffer ourselves to do anything derogatory to our dignity. We
must have been unworthy of all esteem had we not set a proper
value upon one like this, and the energy of my sentiments which
have rendered us culpable, was that which prevented us from
becoming so.

Thus after a long friendship for one of these women, and the
strongest affection for the other, I bade them both adieu the
same day, to one never to see her more, to the other to see her
again twice, upon occasions of which I shall hereafter speak.

After their departure, I found myself much embarrassed to
fulfill so many pressing and contradictory duties, the
consequences of my imprudence; had I been in my natural situation,
after the proposition and refusal of the journey to Geneva, I
had only to remain quiet, and everything was as it should
be. But I had foolishly made of it an affair which could not
remain in the state it was, and an explanation was
absolutely necessary, unless I quitted the Hermitage, which
I had just promised Madam d'Houdetot not to do, at least for the
present. Moreover she had required me to make known the reasons
for my refusal to my pretended friends, that it might not be imputed
to her. Yet I could not state the true reason without doing an
outrage to Madam d'Epinay, who certainly had a right to my gratitude
for what she had done for me. Everything well considered, I
found myself reduced to the severe but indispensable necessity of
failing in respect, either to Madam d'Upinay, Madam d'Houdetot or
to myself; and it was the last I resolved to make my victim.

This I did without hesitation, openly and fully, and with so much
generosity as to make the act worthy of expiating the faults
which had reduced me to such an extremity. This sacrifice, taken
advantage of by my enemies, and which they, perhaps, did not expect,
has ruined my reputation, and by their assiduity, deprived me of
the esteem of the public; but it has restored to me my own, and
given me consolation in my misfortune.

This, as it will hereafter appear, is not the last time I made such
a sacrifice, nor that advantages were taken of it to do
me an injury.

Grimm was the only person who appeared to have taken no part in
the affair, and it was to him I determined to address myself.

I wrote him a long letter, in which I set forth the ridiculousness
of considering it as my duty to accompany Madam d' Epinay to
Geneva, the inutility of the measure, and the embarrassment even
it would have caused her, besides the inconvenience to
myself.

I could not resist the temptation of letting him perceive in this
letter how fully I was informed in what manner things were arranged,
and that to me it appeared singular I should be expected to undertake
the journey whilst he himself dispensed with it, and that his name
was never mentioned.

This letter, wherein, on account of my not being able clearly
to state my reasons, I was often obliged to wander from the
text, would have rendered me culpable in the eyes of the public,
but it was a model of reservedness and discretion for the
people who, like Grimm, were fully acquainted with the things
I forbore to mention, and which justified my conduct. I did not
even hesitate to raise another prejudice against myself in attributing
the advice of Diderot, to my other friends. This I did to
insinuate that Madam d'Houdetot had been in the same opinion as
she really was, and in not mentioning that, upon the reasons
I gave her, she thought differently, I could not better remove
the suspicion of her having connived at my proceedings than
appearing dissatisfied with her behavior.

This letter was concluded by an act of confidence which would have
had an effect upon any other man; for, in desiring Grimm to weigh
my reasons and afterwards to give me his opinion, I informed him
that, let this be what it would, I should act accordingly, and such
was my intention had he even thought I ought to set off; for M.
d'Epinay having appointed himself the conductor of his wife, my
going with them would then have had a different appearance; whereas
it was I who, in the first place, was asked to take upon me that
employment, and he was out of the question until after my refusal.

The answer from Grimm was slow incoming; it was singular enough,
on which account I will here transcribe it.

"The departure of Madam d'Epinay is postponed; her son is ill, and
it is necessary to wait until his health is re-established. I
will consider the contents of your letter. Remain quiet at
your Hermitage. I will send you my opinion as soon as this shall
be necessary.

As she will certainly not set off for some days, there is no
immediate occasion for it. In the meantime you may, if you think
proper, make her your offers, although this to me seems a matter
of indifference. For, knowing your situation as well as you
do yourself, I doubt not of her returning to your offer such an
answer as she ought to do; and all the advantage which, in my
opinion, can result from this, will be your having it in your
power to say to those by whom you may be importuned, that your not
being of the travelling party was not for want of having made your
offers to that effect.

Moreover, I do not see why you will absolutely have it that the
philosopher is the speaking-trumpet of all the world, nor
because he is of opinion you ought to go, why you should imagine
all your friends think as he does? If you write to Madam
d'Epinay, her answer will be yours to all your friends, since you
have it so much at heart to give them all an answer. Adieu. I
embrace Madam le Vasseur and the Criminal."
[M. le Vasseur, whose wife governed him rather rudely, called her
the Lieutenant Criminal. Grimm in a joke gave the same name to
the daughter, and by way of abridgment was pleased to retrench
the first word.]
Struck with astonishment at reading this letter I vainly endeavored
to find out what it meant. How! instead of answering me with
simplicity, he took time to consider of what I had written, as if
the time he had already taken was not sufficient! He intimates
even the state of suspense in which he wishes to keep me, as
if a profound problem was to be resolved, or that it was of
importance to his views to deprive me of every means of
comprehending his intentions until the moment he should think
proper to make them known.

What therefore did he mean by these precautions, delays, and
mysteries?

Was this manner of acting consistent with honor and uprightness?
I vainly sought for some favorable interpretation of his conduct;
it was impossible to find one. Whatever his design might be, were
this inimical to me, his situation facilitated the execution of
it without its being possible for me in mine to oppose the
least obstacle. In favor in the house of a great prince, having
an extensive acquaintance, and giving the tone to common circles
of which he was the oracle, he had it in his power, with his usual
address, to dispose everything in his favor; and I, alone in my
Hermitage, far removed from all society, without the benefit of
advice, and having no communication with the world, had nothing to
do but to remain in peace.

They always put the ancient prophets in jail; that is
the way to know a prophet when you meet him. Let me quote another
prophet who is now behind bars--Alexander Berkman, in his "Prison
Memoirs of an Anarchist", discussing the same subject of
plutocratic pretension:

Tell me, you four hundred, where did you get it? Who gave it to
you? Your grandfather, you say? Your father? Can you go all the
way back and show there is no flaw anywhere in your title? I tell
you that the beginning and the root of your wealth is necessarily
in injustice. And why? Because Nature did not make this man rich
and that man poor from the start. Nature does not intend for one
man to have capital and another to be a wage-slave. Nature made
the earth to be cultivated by all. The idea we Anarchists have of
the rich is of highwaymen, standing in the street and robbing
every one that passes.

Or take "Big Bill" Haywood, chief of the I. W. W. Hear what he
has to say in a pamphlet addressed to the harvest-hands he is
seeking to organize:

How much farther do you plutes expect to go with your grabbing?
Do you want to be the only people left on earth? Why else do you
drive out the workers from all share in Nature, and claim
everything for yourselves? The earth was made for all, rich and
poor alike; where do you get your title deeds to it? Nature gave
everything for all men to use alike; it is only your robbery
which makes your so-called "ownership". Capital has no rights.
The land belongs to Nature, and we are all Nature's sons.

Or take Eugene V. Debs, three times candidate of the Socialist
Party for President. I quote from one of his pamphlets:

The propertied classes are like people who go into a public
theatre and refuse to let anyone else come in, treating as
private property what is meant for social use. If each man would
take only what he needs, and leave the balance to those who have
nothing, there would be no rich and no poor. The rich man is a
thief.

At this point, according to the report published in the Jerusalem
"Times", a police sergeant stepped up to the orator and notified
him that he was under arrest; he submitted quietly, but one of
his followers attempted to use a knife, and was severely clubbed.
Jesus was taken to the station-house followed by a riotous
throng, and held upon a charge of disorderly conduct. Next
morning the Rev. Dr. Caiaphas of Old Trinity appeared against
him, and Magistrate Pilate sentenced him to six months on
Blackwell's Island, remarking that from this time on he proposed
to make an example of those soap-box orators who persist in using
threatening and abusive language. I proposed to myself to use more
diligence when I should be less interrupted. I am of opinion
I have sufficiently fulfilled this intention; and for a man
frequently ill, often at La Chevrette, at Epinay, at Raubonne,
at the castle of Montmorency, at other times interrupted by the
indolent and curious, and always employed half the day in copying,
if what I produced during the six years I passed at the Hermitage
and at Montmorency be considered, I am persuaded it will appear
that if, in this interval, I lost my time, it was not in idleness.

Of the different works I had upon the stocks, that I had longest
resolved in my mind which was most to my taste; to which I destined
a certain portion of my life, and which, in my opinion, was to
confirm the reputation I had acquired, was my 'Institutions Politiques.

I had, fourteen years before, when at Venice, where I had an
opportunity of remarking the defects of that government so much
boasted of, conceived the first idea of them. Since that time
my views had become much more extended by the historical study
of morality. I had perceived everything to be radically connected
with politics, and that, upon whatever principles these were
founded, a people would never be more than that which the nature
of the government made them; therefore the great question of
the best government possible appeared to me to be reduced to
this: What is the nature of a government the most proper to form
the most virtuous and enlightened, the wisest and best people,
taking the last epithet in its most extensive meaning? I thought
this question was much if not quite of the same nature with that
which follows: What government is that which, by its nature,
always maintains itself nearest to the laws, or least deviates
from the laws. Hence, what is the law? and a series of questions
of similar importance. I perceived these led to great truths,
useful to the happiness of mankind, but more especially to
that of my country, wherein, in the journey I had just made to it,
I had not found notions of laws and liberty either sufficiently
just or clear.

I had thought this indirect manner of communicating these to
my fellow-citizens would be least mortifying to their pride, and
might obtain me forgiveness for having seen a little further
than themselves.

Although I had already labored five or six years at the work,
the progress I had made in it was not considerable.
Writings of this kind require meditation, leisure and tranquillity.
I had besides written the 'Institutions Politiques',
as the expression is, 'en bonne fortune', and had not communicated
my project to any person; not even to Diderot.
I was afraid it would be thought too daring for the age and country
in which I wrote, and that the fears of my friends would restrain
me from carrying it into execution.

[It was more especially the wise severity of Duclos which inspired
me with this fear; as for Diderot, I know not by what means all
my conferences with him tended to make me more satirical than my
natural disposition inclined me to be.

This prevented me from consulting him upon an undertaking, in which
I wished to introduce nothing but the force of reasoning without
the least appearance of ill humor or partiality. The
manner of this work may be judged of by that of the 'Contrat
Social', which is taken from it.]
I did not yet know that it would be finished in time, and
in such a manner as to appear before my decease. I wished fearlessly
to give to my subject everything it required; fully persuaded
that not being of a satirical turn, and never wishing to be
personal, I should in equity always be judged irreprehensible. I
undoubtedly wished fully to enjoy the right of thinking which I
had by birth; but still respecting the government under which I
lived, without ever disobeying its laws, and very attentive not
to violate the rights of persons, I would not from fear
renounce its advantages.

I confess, even that, as a stranger, and living in France, I found
my situation very favorable in daring to speak the truth;
well knowing that continuing, as I was determined to do, not
to print anything in the kingdom without permission, I was not
obliged to give to any person in it an account of my maxims nor
of their publication elsewhere. I should have been less independent
even at Geneva, where, in whatever place my books might have
been printed, the magistrate had a right to criticise their contents.
This consideration had greatly contributed to make me yield
to the solicitations of Madam d'Epinay, and abandon the project
of fixing my residence at Geneva. I felt, as I have remarked in
my Emilius, that unless an author be a man of intrigue, when he
wishes to render his works really useful to any country whatsoever,
he must compose them in some other.

What made me find my situation still more happy, was my being
persuaded that the government of France would, perhaps, without
looking upon me with a very favorable eye, make it a point to
protect me, or at least not to disturb my tranquillity. It appeared
to me a stroke of simple, yet dexterous policy, to make a merit
of tolerating that which there was no means of preventing; since,
had I been driven from France, which was all government had the
right to do, my work would still have been written, and perhaps
with less reserve; whereas if I were left undisturbed, the
author remained to answer for what he wrote, and a prejudice,
general throughout all Europe, would be destroyed by acquiring
the reputation of observing a proper respect for the rights of
persons.

They who, by the event, shall judge I was deceived, may perhaps
be deceived in their turn. In the storm which has since broken
over my head, my books served as a pretence, but it was against
my person that every shaft was directed.

My persecutors gave themselves but little concern about the
author, but they wished to ruin Jean Jacques; and the greatest
evil they found in my writings was the honor they might possibly
do me. Let us not encroach upon the future. I do not know that
this mystery, which is still one to me, will hereafter be cleared
up to my readers; but had my avowed principles been of a
nature to bring upon me the treatment I received, I should sooner
have become their victim, since the work in which these
principles are manifested with most courage, not to call it audacity,
seemed to have had its effect previous to my retreat to the
Hermitage, without I will not only say my having received the
least censure, but without any steps having been taken to prevent
the publication of it in France, where it was sold as publicly
as in Holland.
The New Eloisa afterwards appeared with the same facility, I dare
add; with the same applause: and, what seems incredible, the
profession of faith of this Eloisa at the point of death is exactly
similar to that of the Savoyard vicar.

Every strong idea in the Social Contract had been before published
in the discourse on Inequality; and every bold opinion in Emilius
previously found in Eloisa. This unrestrained freedom did not
excite the least murmur against the first two works; therefore
it was not that which gave cause to it against the latter.

Another undertaking much of the same kind, but of which the project
was more recent, then engaged my attention: this was the
extract of the works of the Abbe de Saint Pierre, of which,
having been led away by the thread of my narrative, I have not
hitherto been able to speak. The idea was suggested to me, after
my return from Geneva, by the Abbe Malby, not immediately from
himself, but by the interposition of Madam Dupin, who had some
interest in engaging me to adopt it.

She was one of the three or four-pretty women of Paris, of whom the
Abbe de Saint Pierre had been the spoiled child, and although she
had not decidedly had the preference, she had at least partaken of
it with Madam d'Aiguillon.

She preserved for the memory of the good man a respect and an
affection which did honor to them both; and her self-love would
have been flattered by seeing the still-born works of her friend
brought to life by her secretary. These works contained excellent
things, but so badly told that the reading of them was almost
insupportable; and it is astonishing the Abbe de Saint Pierre,
who looked upon his readers as schoolboys, should nevertheless
have spoken to them as men, by the little care he took to
induce them to give him a hearing. It was for this purpose that
the work was proposed to me as useful in itself, and very proper
for a man laborious in manoeuvre, but idle as an author, who
finding the trouble of thinking very fatiguing, preferred, in
things which pleased him, throwing a light upon and extending
the ideas of others, to producing any himself.
Besides, not being confined to the functions of a translator, I
was at liberty sometimes to think for myself; and I had it in my
power to give such a form to my work, that many important truths
would pass in it under the name of the Abbe de Saint Pierre, much
more safely than under mine.
The undertaking also was not trifling; the business was
nothing less than to read and meditate twenty-three volumes,
diffuse, confused, full of long narrations and periods, repetitions,
and false or little views, from amongst which it was necessary to
select some few that were good and useful, and sufficiently encouraging
to enable me to support the painful labor.

I frequently wished to have given it up, and should have
done so, could I have got it off my hands with a great grace; but
when I received the manuscripts of the abbe, which were given
to me by his nephew, the Comte de Saint Pierre, I had, by the
solicitation of St. Lambert, in some measure engaged to make
use of them, which I must either have done, or have given them
back. It was with the former intention I had taken the manuscripts
to the Hermitage, and this was the first work to which I proposed
to dedicate my leisure hours.

I had likewise in my own mind projected a third, the idea of
which I owed to the observations I had made upon myself and I
felt the more disposed to undertake this work, as I had reason
to hope I could make it a truly useful one, and perhaps, the
most so of any that could be offered to the world, were the
execution equal to the plan I had laid down.

It has been remarked that most men are in the course of their
lives frequently unlike themselves, and seem to be transformed
into others very different from what they were. It was not to
establish a thing so generally known that I wished to write a
book; I had a newer and more important object. This was
to search for the causes of these variations, and, by confining
my observations to those which depend on ourselves, to demonstrate
in what manner it might be possible to direct them, in order to
render us better and more certain of our dispositions.

  For it is undoubtedly more painful to an
  honest man to resist desires already formed, and which it is his
duty to subdue, than to prevent, change, or modify the same desires
in their source, were he capable of tracing them to it.

A man under temptation resists once because he has strength of
mind, he yields another time because this is overcome; had it
been the same as before he would again have triumphed.

By examining within myself, and searching in others what could
be the cause of these different manners of being, I discovered
that, in a great measure they depended on the anterior impressions
of external objects; and that, continually modified by our
senses and organs, we, without knowing it, bore in our ideas,
sentiments, and even actions, the effect of these modifications.
The striking and numerous observations I had collected were beyond
all manner of dispute, and by their natural principle seemed
proper to furnish an exterior regimen, which varied according to
circumstances, might place and support the mind in the state most
favorable to virtue.

From how many mistakes would reason be preserved, how many vices
would be stifled in their birth, were it possible to force animal
economy to favor moral order, which it so frequently disturbs!
Climate, seasons, sounds, colors, light, darkness, the
elements, ailments, noise, silence, motion, rest, all act on the
animal machine, and consequently on the mind: all offer a thousand
means, almost certain of directing in their origin the
sentiments by which we suffer ourselves to be governed. Such was
the fundamental idea of which I had already made a sketch
upon paper, and whence I hoped for an effect the more certain,
in favor of persons well disposed, who, sincerely loving virtue,
were afraid of their own weakness, as it appeared to me easy
to make of it a book as agreeable to read as it was to compose.

I have, however, applied myself but very little to this
work, the title of which was to have been 'Morale Sensitive' ou
le Materialisme du Sage.
--[Sensitive Morality, or the Materialism of the Sage.]--Interruptions,
the cause of which will soon appear, prevented me from continuing
it, and the fate of the sketch, which is more connected with my
own than it may appear to be, will hereafter be seen.

Besides this, I had for some time meditated a system of education,
of which Madam de Chenonceaux, alarmed for her son by that of
her husband, had desired me to consider. The authority of friendship
placed this object, although less in itself to my taste, nearer
to my heart than any other. On which account this subject, of
all those of which I have just spoken, is the only one I carried
to its utmost extent. The end I proposed to myself in treating of
it should, I think, have procured the author a better fate. But
I will not here anticipate this melancholy subject. I shall
have too much reason to speak of it in the course of my
work.

These different objects offered me subjects of meditation for
my walks; for, as I believed I had already observed, I am unable
to reflect when I am not walking: the moment I stop, I think no
more, and as soon as I am again in motion my head resumes its
workings. I had, however, provided myself with a work for the
closet upon rainy days.

This was my dictionary of music, which my scattered, mutilated, and
unshapen materials made it necessary to rewrite almost entirely.

I had with me some books necessary to this purpose; I had spent
two months in making extracts from others, I had borrowed
from the king's library, whence I was permitted to take several
to the Hermitage. I was thus provided with materials for
composing in my apartment when the weather did not permit me to
go out, and my copying fatigued me. This arrangement was so
convenient that it made it turn to advantage as well at the
Hermitage as at Montmorency, and afterwards even at Motiers, where
I completed the work whilst I was engaged in others, and constantly
found a change of occupation to be a real relaxation.

During a considerable time I exactly followed the distribution I
had prescribed myself, and found it very agreeable; but
as soon as the fine weather brought Madam d'Epinay more frequently
to Epinay, or to the Chervette, I found that attentions, in the
first instance natural to me, but which I had not considered in my
scheme, considerably deranged my projects.

I have already observed that Madam d'Epinay had many amiable
qualities; she sincerely loved her friends; served them with zeal;
and, not sparing for them either time or pains, certainly
deserved on their part every attention in return. I had hitherto
discharged this duty without considering it as one, but at
length I found that I had given myself a chain of which nothing
but friendship prevented me from feeling the weight,
and this was still aggravated by my dislike to numerous
societies. Madam d' Epinay took advantage of these circumstances
to make me a proposition seemingly agreeable to me, but which was
more so to herself; this was to let me know when she was alone,
or had but little company. I consented, without perceiving to
what a degree I engaged myself. The consequence was that I no
longer visited her at my own hour --but at hers, and that I
never was certain of being master of myself for a day
together.

And social architects who build the State,
  Serving the Dream at citadel and gate,
  Will hail Him coming through the labor-hum.
  And glad quick cries will go from man to man:
  "Lo, He has come, our Christ the artisan,
  The King who loved the lilies, He has come!"


The Knowable

The new religion will base itself upon the facts of life, as
demonstrated by experience and reason; for to the modern thinker
the basis of all interest is truth, and the wonders of the
microscope and the telescope, of the new psychology and the new
sociology are more wonderful than all the magic recorded in
ancient Mythologies. And even if this were not so, the business
of the thinker is to follow the facts. The history of all
philosophy might be summed up in this simile: The infant opens
his eyes and sees the moon, and stretches out his hands and cries
for it, but those in charge do not give it to him, and so after a
while the infant tires of crying, and turns to his mother's
breast and takes a drink of milk.

Man demands to know the origin of life; it is intolerable for him
to be here, and not know how, or whence, or why. He demands the
knowledge immediately and finally, and invents innumerable
systems and creeds. He makes himself believe them, with fire and
torture makes other men believe them; until finally, in the
confusion of a million theories, it occurs to him to investigate
his instruments, and he makes the discovery that his tools are
inadequate, and all their products worthless. His mind is finite,
while the thing he seeks is infinite; his knowledge is relative,
while the First Cause is absolute.

This realization we owe to Immanuel Kant, the father of modern
philosophy. In his famous "antinomies", he proved four
propositions: first, that the universe is limitless in time and
space; second, that matter is composed of simple, indivisible
elements; third, that free will is impossible; and fourth, that
there must be an absolute or first cause. And having proven these
things, he turned round and proved their opposites, with
arguments exactly as unanswerable. Any one who follows these
demonstrations and understands them, takes all his metaphysical
learning and lays it on the shelf with his astrology and magic.

It is a fact, which every one who wishes to think must get clear,
that when you are dealing with absolutes and ultimates, you can
prove whatever you want to prove. Metaphysics is like the fourth
dimension; you fly into it and come back upside down, hindside
foremost, inside out; and when you get tired of this condition,
you take another flight, and come back the way you were before.
He saw that this commerce would open to him a field of vast
wealth, could he succeed in obtaining an exclusive privilege
to enjoy its advantages, and managed to induce
Chauvin, a captain in the navy, to apply to the king for
powers such as De la Roche had possessed:
the application was successful, a patent was granted to
Chauvin, and Pontgravé admitted to partnership. (1602.)
It was, however, in vain that they attempted to establish a
trading post at Tadoussac:[98] after having made two voyages thither
without realizing their sanguine expectations of gain, Chauvin
died while once more preparing to try his fortune.

At this time the great object of colonization was completely forgotten
in the eager pursuit of the fur trade, till De Chatte, the governor
of Dieppe, who succeeded to the privileges of Chauvin, founded a
company of merchants at Rouen, for the further development of the
resources of Canada. (1603.)

An armament was fitted out under the command of the experienced
Pontgravé; he was commissioned by the king to make further
discoveries in the St. Lawrence, and to establish a settlement
upon some suitable position on the coast. Samuel de Champlain,
a captain in the navy, accepted a command in this expedition
at the request of De Chatte; he was a native of Saintonge, and
had lately returned to France from the West Indies, where he
had gained a high name for boldness and skill. Under the direction
of this wise and energetic man the first successful efforts were
made to found a permanent settlement in the magnificent province
of Canada, and the stain of the errors and disasters of more than
seventy years was at length wiped away.

Pontgravé and Champlain sailed for the St. Lawrence in 1603. They
remained a short time at Tadoussac, where they left their
ships; then, trusting themselves to a small, open boat, with only
five sailors, they boldly pushed up the Great River to the sault St.

Louis, where Jacques Cartier had reached many years before. By
this time Hochelaga, the ancient Indian city, had, from some unknown
cause, sunk into such insignificance that the adventurers did
not even notice it, nor deem it worthy of a visit; but they
anchored for a time under the shade of the magnificent headland
of Quebec. On the return of the expedition to France, Champlain
found, to his deep regret, that De Chatte, the worthy and powerful
patron of the undertaking, had died during his absence.
Pierre du Guast, sieur de Monts, had succeeded to the powers and
privileges of the deceased, with even a more extensive commission.

De Monts was a Calvinist, and had obtained from the king the freedom
of religious faith for himself and his followers in America, but
under the engagement that the Roman Catholic worship should be
established among the natives.

Even his opponents admitted the honesty and patriotism of his
character,[99] and bore witness to his courage and ability; he was,
nevertheless, unsuccessful; many of those under his command failed
in their duty, and the jealousy excited by his exclusive privileges
and obnoxious doctrines[100] involved him in ruinous embarrassments.

The trading company established by De Chatte was continued and
increased by his successor. With this additional aid De Monts
was enabled to fit out a more complete armament than had ever
hitherto been engaged in Canadian commerce. He sailed from Havre
on the 7th of March, 1604, with four vessels. Of these, two under
his immediate command were destined for Acadia. Champlain,
Poutrincourt, and many other volunteers, embarked their fortunes
with him, purposing to cast their future lot in the New World.
A third vessel was dispatched under Pontgravé to the Strait of
Canso, to protect the exclusive trading privileges of
the company. The fourth steered for Tadoussac, to barter for the
rich furs brought by the Indian hunters from the dreary wilds
of the Saguenay.

On the 6th of May De Monts reached a harbor on the coast of
Acadia, where he seized and confiscated an English vessel,
in vindication of his exclusive privileges. Thence he sailed to
the Island of St. Croix, where he landed his people, and established
himself for the winter. In the spring of 1605 he hastened
to leave this settlement, where the want of wood and fresh water,
and the terrible ravages of the scurvy, had disheartened and
diminished the number of his followers. In the mean time Champlain
had discovered and named Port Royal, now Annapolis, a situation
which presented many natural advantages. De Monts removed the
establishment thither, and erected a fort, appointing
Pontgravé to its command. Soon afterward he bestowed Port Royal
and a large extent of the neighboring country upon De Poutrincourt,
and the grant was ultimately confirmed by letters patent from
the king. This was the first concession of land made in North
America since its discovery.

When De Monts returned to France in 1605, he found that
enemies had been busily and successfully at work in destroying
his influence at court.
Complaints of the injustice of his exclusive privileges poured in
from all the ports in the kingdom. It was urged that he had
interfered with and thwarted the fisheries, under the
pretense of securing the sole right of trading with the
Indian hunters. These statements were hearkened to by the king,
and all the Sieur's privileges were revoked.
De Monts bore up bravely against this disaster. He entered into a
new engagement with De Poutrincourt, who had followed him to
France, and dispatched a vessel from Rochelle on the 13th of May
to succor the colony in Acadia. The voyage was unusually protracted,
and the settlers at Port Royal, at length reduced to great
extremities, feared that they had been abandoned to their fate.

The wise and energetic Pontgravé did all that man could do to
reassure them; but, finally, their supplies being completely
exhausted, he was constrained to yield to the general wish, and
embark his people for France. He had scarcely sailed, however,
when he heard of the arrival of Poutrincourt and the
long-desired supplies. He then immediately returned to Port
Royal, where he found his chief already landed. Under able and
judicious management,[101] the colony increased and prospered
until 1614, when it was attacked and broken up by Sir Samuel
Argall with a Virginian force.[102]
The enemies of De Monts did not relax in their efforts till he was
deprived of his high commission. A very insufficient indemnity was
granted for the great expenses he had incurred. Still he was not
disheartened: in the following year, 1607, he obtained a renewal
of his privileges for one year, on condition that he should plant
a colony upon the banks of the St. Lawrence. The trading company
did not lose confidence in their principal, although his courtly
influence had been destroyed; but their object was confined to the
prosecution of the lucrative commerce in furs, for which reason
they ceased to interest themselves in Acadia, and turned their
thoughts to the Great River of Canada, where they hoped to find a
better field for their undertaking.

They equipped two ships at Honfleur, under the command of Champlain
and Pontgravé, to establish the fur trade at Tadoussac.

De Monts remained in France, vainly endeavoring to obtain an
extension of his patent. Despite his disappointments, he fitted
out some vessels in the spring of 1608, with the assistance of
the company, and dispatched them to the River St. Lawrence
on the 13th of April, under the same command as before.

Champlain reached Tadoussac on the 3d of June; his views were far
more extended than those of a mere merchant; even honest fame for
himself, and increase of glory and power for his country, were, in
his eyes, objects subordinate to the extension of the Catholic faith.

After a brief stay, he ascended the Great River, examining the shore
with minute care, to seek the most fitting place where the first
foundation of French empire might be laid. On the 3d of July he
reached QUEBEC, where, nearly three quarters of a century before,
Jacques Cartier had passed the winter. This magnificent position
was at once chosen by Champlain as the site of the future
capital of Canada: centuries of experience have proved the wisdom
of the selection; admirably situated for purposes of war or commerce,
and completely commanding the navigation of the Great River, it
stands the center of a scene of beauty that can nowhere be
surpassed.

  On the bold headland overlooking the waters of
  the basin, he commenced his work by felling the
  trees, and rooting up the wild vines and tangled
  underwood from the virgin soil.

Some rude huts were speedily erected for shelter; spots around
them were cultivated to test the fertility of the land: this
labor was repaid by abundant production. The first permanent
work undertaken in the new settlement was the erection of a
solid building as a magazine for their provisions. A temporary
barrack on the highest point of the position, for the officers
and men, was subsequently constructed. These preparations occupied
the remainder of the summer. The first snow fell on the
18th of November, but only remained on the ground for two days:
in December it again returned, and the face of nature was covered
till the end of April, 1609. From the time of Jacques Cartier
to the establishment of Champlain, and even to the present day,
there has been no very decided amelioration of the severity of
the climate; indeed, some of the earliest records notice seasons
milder than many of modern days.

The town of Stadacona, like its prouder neighbor of Hochelaga,
seems to have dwindled into insignificance since the time
when it had been an object of such interest and suspicion to
Jacques Cartier. Some Indians still lived in huts around Quebec,
but in a state of poverty and destitution, very different from
the condition of their ancestors.

During the winter of 1608, they suffered dire extremities of
famine; several came over from the southern shores of the river,
miserably reduced by starvation, and scarcely able to drag along
their feeble limbs, to seek aid from the strangers.

Champlain relieved their necessities and treated them with
politic kindness. The French suffered severely from the scurvy
during the first winter of their residence.

On the 18th of April, 1609, Champlain, accompanied by two Frenchmen,
ascended the Great River with a war party of Canadian Indians.
After a time, turning southward up a tributary stream, he came
to the shores of a large and beautiful lake, abounding with fish;
the shores and neighboring forests sheltered, in their undisturbed
solitude, countless deer and other animals of the chase.

To this splendid sheet of water he gave his own name, which it
still bears. To the south and west rose huge snow-capped mountains,
and in the fertile valleys below dwelt numbers of the fierce and
hostile Iroquois. Champlain and his savage allies pushed on to
the furthest extremity of the lake, descended a rapid, and entered
another smaller sheet of water, afterward named St. Sacrement. On
the shore they encountered two hundred of the Iroquois warriors;
a battle ensued; the skill and the astonishing weapons of the white
men soon gave their Canadian allies a complete victory.

Many prisoners were taken, and, in spite of Champlain's
remonstrances, put to death with horrible and protracted tortures.
The brave Frenchman returned to Quebec, and sailed
for Europe in September, leaving Captain Pierre Chauvin, an
experienced officer, in charge of the infant settlement. Henry
IV.
received Champlain with favor, and called him to an interview
at Fontainebleau:[103] the king listened attentively to the
report of the new colony, expressing great satisfaction at
its successful foundation and favorable promise. But the
energetic De Monts, to whom so much of this success was due,
could find no courtly aid: the renewal of his privilege was
refused, and its duration had already expired.

By the assistance of the Merchant Company, he fitted out two vessels
in the spring of 1610, under the tried command of Champlain and
Pontgravé: the first was destined for Quebec, with some artisans,
settlers, and necessary supplies for the colony; the second was
commissioned to carry on the fur trade at Tadoussac. Champlain
sailed from Honfleur on the 8th of April, and reached the mouth
of the Saguenay in eighteen days, a passage which even all the
modern improvements in navigation have rarely enabled any one to
surpass in rapidity. He soon hastened on to Quebec, where, to his
great joy, he found the colonists contented and prosperous;
the virgin soil had abundantly repaid the labors of cultivation,
and the natives had in no wise molested their dangerous visitors.
He joined the neighboring tribes of Algonquin and Montagnez
Indians, during the summer, in an expedition against the
Iroquois.
Having penetrated the woody country beyond Sorel for some distance,
they came upon a place where their enemies were intrenched; this
they took, after a bloody resistance. Champlain and
another Frenchman were slightly wounded in the encounter.

     In 1612 Champlain found it necessary
           to revisit France; some
      powerful patron was wanted to
           forward the interests of the
  colony, and to provide the supplies and resources required
      for its extension. The Count
           de Soissons readily entered
      into his views, and delegated
           to him the authority of
viceroy, which had been conferred upon the count.[104] Soissons
died soon after, and the Prince of Condé became his successor.

Champlain was wisely continued in the command he had so long and
ably held, but was delayed in France for some time by difficulties
on the subject of commerce with the merchants of St.

Malo.

Champlain sailed again from St. Malo on the 6th of March, 1613,
in a vessel commanded by Pontgravé, and anchored before
Quebec on the 7th of May. He found the state of affairs at the
settlement so satisfactory that his continued presence was
unnecessary; he therefore proceeded at once to Montreal, and,
after a short stay at that island, explored for some distance the
course of the Ottawa, which there pours its vast flood into the
main stream of the St.

Lawrence. The white men were filled with wonder and admiration
at the magnitude of this great tributary, the richness and
beauty of its shores, the broad lakes and deep rapids, and the
eternal forests, clothing mountain, plain, and valley for
countless leagues around. As they proceeded they found no
diminution in the volume of water; and when they inquired of the
wandering Indian for its source, he pointed to the northwest,
and indicated that it lay in the unknown solitudes of ice and
snow, to which his people had never reached. After this expedition
Champlain returned with his companion Pontgravé to St.
Malo, where they arrived in the end of August.

Having engaged some wealthy merchants of St. Malo, Rouen, and
Rochelle in an association for the support of the colony, through
the assistance of the Prince of Condé, viceroy of New France,
he obtained letters patent of incorporation for the company
(1614). The temporal welfare of the settlement being thus placed
upon a secure basis, Champlain, who was a zealous Catholic,
next devoted himself to obtain spiritual aid.

By his entreaties four Recollets were prevailed upon to undertake
the mission.
These were the first[105] ministers of religion settled in Canada.
They reached Quebec in the beginning of April, 1615, accompanied
by Champlain, who, however, at once proceeded to Montreal.

On arriving at this island, he found the Huron and other allied
tribes again preparing for an expedition against the Iroquois.
With a view of gaining the friendship of the savages, and of
acquiring a knowledge of the country, he injudiciously offered
himself to join a quarrel in which he was in no wise concerned.
The father Joseph Le Caron accompanied him, in the view of preparing
the way for religious instruction, by making himself acquainted
with the habits and language of the Indians.

Champlain was appointed chief by the allies, but his savage
followers rendered slight obedience to this authority. The
expedition proved very disastrous: the Iroquois were strongly
intrenched, and protected by a quantity of felled trees; their
resistance proved successful; Champlain was wounded, and the
allies were forced to retreat with shame and with heavy
loss.

The respect of the Indians for the French was much diminished
by this untoward failure; they refused to furnish Champlain with
a promised guide to conduct him to Quebec, and he was obliged to
pass the winter among them as an unwilling guest. He,
however, made the best use of his time; he visited many of the
principal Huron and Algonquin towns, even those as distant as Lake
Nipissing, and succeeded in reconciling several neighboring nations.

At the opening of the navigation, he gained over some of the
Indians to his cause, and, finding that another expedition against
the Iroquois was in preparation, embarked secretly and arrived at
Quebec on the 11th of July, 1616, when he found that he and the
father Joseph were supposed to have been dead long since. They
both sailed for France soon after their return from among the
Hurons.

In the following year, a signal service was rendered to the colony
by a worthy priest named Duplessys: he had been engaged for some
time at Three Rivers in the instruction of the savages, and had
happily so far gained their esteem, that some of his pupils informed
him of a conspiracy among all the neighboring Indian tribes for the
utter destruction of the French; eight hundred chiefs and warriors
had assembled to arrange the plan of action.

Duplessys contrived, with consummate ability, to gain over some of
the principal Indians to make advances toward a reconciliation with
the white men, and, by degrees, succeeded in arranging a treaty,
and in causing two chiefs to be given up as hostages for its
observance.

For several years Champlain was constantly obliged to visit France
for the purpose of urging on the tardily provided aids for the
colony.

The court would not interest itself in the affairs of New France
since a company had undertaken their conduct, and the merchants,
always limited in their views to mere commercial objects, cared
but little for the fate of the settlers so long as their warehouses
were stored with the valuable furs brought by the Indian hunters.

These difficulties would doubtless have smothered the infant
nation in its cradle, had it not been for the untiring zeal and
constancy of its great founder.

Reader:

For twenty years I have been haunted by the dream that I might
some day be my own publisher. I was waiting till I could afford
the luxury; but many a man has put off a bold action till he
died, so I am publishing this book without being able to afford
it.

The reason is that I do not want to be a writer for the rich. I
want to be read by working-boys and girls, and by poor students.

I offer the book at a low price. In the hope of tempting you to
go out and get your friends to read it, I have made a price in
quantities which will allow no profit at all. A margin has been
figured to cover postage, stationery, circulars, and the cost of
a clerical assistant; but nothing for interest on capital, which
is a gift, nor for the rent of an office, which is my home, nor
for the services of manager and press agent, which is myself.

And I presume that it will be agreed that whales and porpoises,
sea fishes, and the innumerable hosts of marine invertebrated
animals, are meant thereby. So "air-population" must be the
equivalent of "fowl" in verse 20, and "every winged fowl after its
kind," verse 21.
