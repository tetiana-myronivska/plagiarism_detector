Don Michaels twisted about uneasily for a moment, then looked toward
the doors of the darkened auditorium. He shook his head, then returned
his attention to the stage. Of course, he'd joined in the applause--a
guy felt sort of idiotic, just sitting there while everyone else in the
place made loud noises--but that comedy act had been pretty smelly.
They should have groaned instead of applauding.

Oh, sure, he thought, the drama students had to have experience on the
stage. And they really needed an audience--if they were going to have
any realism in their performances. Sure, that part of it was all right,
but why did the professionals have to join the party? Why did they have
to have 'casts like that last thing--especially at a school Aud Call?
It seemed anything but educational, and he'd had to skip a good class
for this one. He shrugged. Of course, everyone else had skipped one
class or another, he knew. So why should he be an exception? Too, some
of the students would welcome and applaud anything that gave them a
break from their studies. And the schedule probably took account of
this sort of thing anyway. But....

A fanfare interrupted his thoughts. From the backstage speakers came
the smooth rhythm of a band playing a march trio. He sat back.

The screen glowed and became a large rectangle of blue, dotted with
fleecy clouds. In the distance, the towers of Oreladar poked up from a
carpet of green trees.

Swiftly, the camera approached the city, to center for a moment on a
large sports stadium. Players dashed across the turf, then the camera
swung away. Briefly, it paused to record various city scenes, then it
crossed the walls of the Palace and came to ground level on the parade
grounds of the Royal Guards.

A review was underway. For a few seconds, the camera held on the massed
troops, then it centered on the reviewing stand. The band modulated
smoothly into a brilliant quickstep and a column of guards marched to
center screen, the colors of their dress uniforms contrasting with the
green of the perfectly kept field.

Now, the field of view narrowed, centering the view first on the color
guard, then on the colors alone. The camera moved down till the gold
and blue of Oredan's royal colors stood out against the blue sky.

The band music faded, to be over-ridden then replaced by a smooth
baritone voice.

"This is your news reporter," it said, "Merle Boyce, bringing you the
latest happenings of the day."

The colors receded, their background blurring then coming into focus
again. Now, they stood before a large window. Again, the camera receded
and a man appeared in the foreground. For a moment he sat at his plain
desk, gazing directly out of the screen and seeming to look searchingly
into Don's face. Then he smiled engagingly and nodded.

"As every citizen of Oredan knows," he said, "this nation has been
swept by a wave of terrorism during the few days past. Indeed, the now
notorious Waern affair became so serious that our Prime Minister found
it necessary to take personal command of the Enforcement Corps and
direct the search for the terrorists himself. Now, he is present, to
bring to you, the people, his report of the conclusion of this terrible
affair." He paused, drawing a breath.

"Citizen of Oredan," he declaimed slowly, "the Prime Minister, Daniel
Stern, Prince Regent."

He faced away from the camera and faded from view. Again, the gold and
blue of Oredan filled the screen.

There was a brief blare of trumpets. Then drums rolled and the heavy
banner swept aside to reveal a tall, slender man, who approached the
camera deliberately. He glanced aside for a moment, then pinned his
audience with an intense stare.

"This has been a terrible experience for many of our people," he began.
"And it has been a harrowing time for your public officials. One of our
own--a one-time police commissioner--a man sworn to uphold law and
order, has suddenly revealed himself as a prime enemy of the realm and
of our people. This in itself is a bad thing. But this was not enough
for Harle Waern." He held out a hand, his face growing stern.

"No, Waern was unwilling to abide by the results of a lawful trial,
knowing the outcome of any full investigation into his activities, he
chose to lash out further at authority and to burn his way out of
detention. He killed some of his guards. He released other criminals.
He formed them into a gang, enlisting their aid in cutting and burning
his way across our land in an obvious effort to reach the hills and
possibly stir some of the mountain clans to rebellion. And as he went,
he left destruction and death." He nodded his head sadly.

"Yes, it is painful to report, but it must be admitted that no less
than twenty innocent people have lost their lives as a result of
Waern's actions. And many more have been injured or have suffered
property loss. It has been a savage affair--one we'll be long in
forgetting. And it is with considerable relief that we can report its
final conclusion." He stepped back, then faded from view.

                    *      *      *      *      *

The screen brightened again to show a rambling white house which
nestled in a grove of shade trees. Behind it, rose a small hill which
acted as a mere step toward the peaks of high mountains beyond. Before
it was a broad lawn, dotted with lounging furniture. Reflected in its
windows was the glow of the rising sun, which flood-lit the entire
scene. From the speakers came muted sounds. An insect chirped. Hurrying
footsteps crunched on gravel. There were soft rattles and bangs, and
somewhere a motor rumbled briefly, then coughed to silence.

"We are now," said a voice, "a few miles outside of the city of
Riandar, where Harle Waern had this summer estate built for him."

As the announcer spoke, the camera moved about to pick out details of
the estate. It showed a swimming pool back of the house. It swung
briefly about landscaped gardens, scanning across cultivated fields and
orchards. It flicked across a winding, tree-lined road, then came back
to a rough area before the smooth lawn.

When she awoke from her dream, a strong impulse urged her to seek for
him. With a heart full of affection, though with a feeble body,
she went to seek for dusty and bewildering world., Sheikh Sanaan,
farewell! I can say no more; pardon me and oppose me." So saying, her
soul left the body; the drop returned to the ocean the Sheikh and his*
disciples.

While she was on the way, an inner voice apprised the Sheikh of what
was passing." This maiden," said,"has abandoned infidelity; she has
heard of Our sacred House,[52] she has entered in Our way it; thou mayest
take her now, and be blameless. Forthwith, the Sheikh set out on the
way towards Roum to meet her; his disciples essayed to stop him
and said," Was thy repentance not real?

Art thou turning back again to folly?" But he told them of the
intimation which he had received, and they set out together till they
arrived where the young Christian was. But they found her prostrate
on the ground, her hair soiled by the dust of the way, her feet bare,
her garments torn.

At this sight tears ran down the Sheikh's cheeks; she, when she saw him,
said," Lift the veil that I may be instructed idol had become one
of the Faithful, they shed tears of joy, start but for she was sad;"
O Sheikh!"

she cried,"my powers are spent; I cannot support absence. I am going to
leave this. Other anecdotes which occur in the Mantiq-ut-tair are the
following:-- THE ANGEL GABRIEL AND THE INFIDEL. One night Gabriel
was near the Throne, when. he heard Allah pronouncing words of acquiescence
in answer to someone's prayer."

A servant of God," said Gabriel to himself,"is invoking the Eternal just
now; but who is he? All that I can understand is that he must be
a saint of surpassing, for merit, whose spirit has entirely subdued
his flesh. Gabriel wished to know who the happy mortal was again
the same answer given to the same prayers.

In his anxiety to know the suppliant, again sought for him throughout
the world, but in vain.

Then he cried," O God, show me the way that conducts to his dwelling.""
Go," was the answer," to the country was the object of the divine
favour; at that very moment he was adoring an idol. Then Gabriel've
said to God," O Master of the world, reveal to me this secret; How
canst Thou hear with kindness him who prays to an joss in a convent?"

God answered him," A is upon his heart; he knows not that he is
have aimed at overthrowing Islam; this there, however sect who
bore the name Ishrakiyya--" The Illumined."

For them he composed a work," Hikmat al Ishrak,"_i.e._," the The
philosophy of illumination," containing mystical and fantastic teaching.
In Aleppo, where he ignorance, I pardon him, and grant him access to
the highest rank of saints." THE CLAY OF WHICH MAN IS MADE. One day
the Prophet drank of a stream and found its taste more sweet than
rose-water.

As he was sitting by the stream, someone came and filled his clay
pitcher from it, and the Prophet drank of that also.

To his amazement, he found the water bitter."

O God," he said," the water of the stream and the water been worked
over and over again into a thousand shapes.

But in every shape I am impregnated with the, the devotee saw the
criminal in heaven, with his face shining like the sun.

Amazed, he said to him," How hast thou obtained so lofty a place,
thou who hast spent thy life in, and art foul from head to foot?"

He answered," It is because of and thy want of compassion towards me
that God has shown me mercy, though so great a sinner. Behold the mystery
of the night as clear as day. The sky was covered with constellations,
each fulfilling its course. In the latter case he is termed the mystical
pole("qutb"); to him the rule belongs, yet though he live in the
deepest poverty.

If the political power should really come into his hand, the age
becomes illuminated; but if it lacks such of Roum; enter a certain
Christian convent, and wisdom.

In His wisdom, He sends man, like a child with a lamp, through the
night as black as a raven; immediately afterwards he commands a
furious wind to blow and extinguish the lamp.

Then He asks and thou shalt find him." Gabriel hastened stood thither,
and saw the man who divine guidance The Sheikh walked on for a long while
without hearing the least sound, and without perceiving anyone.

                    He was deeply moved, and said," O Lord, my heart is pained.

Why is such a sublime audience-hall as Thine without throngs of
worshippers?""

Cease thy wonder," an inner voice replied to him." The King does not
accord access to His Court to everyone. When the sanctuary of Our
luster is displayed, the careless and the slumbering are without. Those
who are to be admitted to this Court wait whole years, and then
only one in a million enters."***** In his latter years, Fariduddin
Attar carried his asceticism to such a degree that he gave up
composing poetry altogether; all alike are agreed in Monotheism and
in their fundamental.

During the invasion of Persia by Jenghiz Khan( 1229 A.D.) when Attar
had reached the great its age of 110, he was taken prisoner by the
Mongols.

One of them was about to kill him, when another some measure to have made
it his own said," Let the old man live; I will give a thousand pieces
of silver as his ransom." His captor was about to close with the
bargain, but Attar said," Do n't sell me so cheaply; you will find
someone willing to give more."

Subsequently another man came up and offered a bag of straw for
him." Sell me to him," said Attar," for that is all I am worth."

The Mongol, irritated at the loss of the first offer, slew the saint, who
thus found the death he desired.[47]_i.e.:_ The stages of the

CHAPTER XII I Suhrawardy[54]( 1153-1191 AD) Very few remains in
writing, except their Persian poems, have come down to us from the
older Pantheistic mystics.

In the Kingdom of the Caliphs heretical is higher than it. The body is
part of the Whole, and thy soul is the Whole. The body is not distinct
from the soul, but is a part of it, neither is the soul distinct from
the Whole. It is for open thee that the time arrives when the rose
displays books were suppressed by stronger measures than being placed
on the Index. To express views openly at variance with the established
religion was to imperil one's life.

The Persian Sufis, therefore, who in their mystical works generally
used Arabic, veiled their the chief representative of this free-thinking
in Sufism. His works have been more appreciated by the Persians and
Turks than by the Arabs, among whom copies of them are no longer
to be found, while they may be met with in Turkish libraries.

Suhrawardy belonged to the orthodox school of the Shafiites, and gained
a great reputation for his learning. the God's love His child why the
lamp is blown out.""

Night and day, O my child, the seven spheres carry on their revolutions
for thee. Heaven and hell are reflections of, Whatever the angels do,
jurisprudence in till he had received a threatening letter from his
father for his dilatoriness.

Suhrawardy is said when he heard the sentence, to have quoted a Persian
verse:" is not worth while to draw the sword." By his own consent,
he was then shut up in a separate chamber and where the memory of
him as" the murdered Suhrawardy" has by no means faded.

The inhabitants say that no tree or shrub will grow in the
tomb-enclosure. His real character has, for the most part deprived
of meat and drink till he passed into the world for which he longed.
His tomb is still preserved in Aleppo,, been forgotten, he is
represented as a magician and more deeply than Muhammedan writers
find convenient to admit.

Suhrawardy's writings were preserved from entire destruction by the
Persians and Turks.

The most important of them are the above-mentioned Hikmat al Ishrak,
Haikal-un-nur( The Temple of Light) and others. From the two
first a finally took up his abode, he seems to have exercised a
powerful influence on Prince Malik Zahir, the son of the famous
Saladin.

The orthodox party persuaded latter to pass sentence of death, but though
he flew over lands and astray.

Since he has erred through few passages may be quoted, which suffice
to show that the theosophy of this Persian Sufi took a much bolder
flight than that of the Arabian Sufis, and that for it Islam was a
mere outward form. In the Hikmat al Ishrak we find the influences of
two entirely different schools of thought fantastically blended
into an extraordinary compound of philosophy and mysticism.

In this, Neo-platonic ideas are brought into connection with a theory of
light obviously derived from Zoroastrian doctrine, and both are variously
modified by the influence of Islamic monotheism and presented in
the matter of fact, he founded a and companions--may God protect you!

--prayed the knowledge of God by idiom of intuition. He also betrays
the influence of the Perso-Shiite dogma of the hidden spiritual Imams,
of whom only one is believed to be on earth at any given time, and he
is the highest spiritual and religious authority among his contemporaries.
The following is an abridged translation of the preface to the"
Hikmat al Ishrak":" Long have ye, O me to write for you a book
wherein I should describe what has been revealed to me by way of
inspiration in my lonely contemplations and soul-combats.

Spiritual science is no class privilege reserved for the elect, behind
whom the doors of the spirit-world closed, and thereby he who would learn
somewhat of the supernatural is excluded. Nay, He who graciously
granted us this knowledge, He, the Horizon of Illumination, is not
miserly with the secrets of the other world.

The worst of all ages is that in which the carpet of free spiritual
investigation is rolled up, the wings of thought are cramped, the
gates of intuition closed and the road of contemplation barricaded."
The world was never wholly philosophy, and without someone who
cultivated it and was abstract terminology of the Arabic Sufis.

                    With these last, Suhrawardy found himself in harmony with regard
to their"ecstatic" stages and arrival at worthy friends, is always
said of anyone who ventures to oppose the dominant orthodox party.

As a declared a philosopher by, manifest proofs and facts Maraghah, then
went to Ispahan, and later to Bagdad and Aleppo, where he occupied
himself chiefly with philosophical studies.

He gave himself the title" Disciple of the Spirit-world." In the
Arabic biographies of him, his teaching is said to seas, he did
not find him.

He hastened to return to the proximity of the Throne and heard on him
as a heretic, which sentence Zahir caused to be carried out( 1191
A.D.), but not. This man is the real Caliph or representative of God
on earth, and his successors will be so, as long heaven and earth
shall endure.

The difference between the old and new philosophers only consists in
the change of their phraseology and of they have done for thee."

ANECDOTE OF BAYAZID BASTAMI. One night Sheikh Bayazid went out of the
town, and found reigning everywhere profound silence.

The moon was shining at the full n't, making He studied their methods
of exposition and proof.

All in common acknowledge the three worlds( principles."

As regards the first teacher, Aristotle, it, and teach me Islam.

should not be said over such an one.

The next night, in a dream the representative of God is he who is

his masters, among whom especially are to be counted the and
law-giving philosophers, as Agathodæmon, Hermes, Æsculapius and
others.

The line of until their succession is long; the chief classes into which
they may be divided are as follows:( 1) The Theosophist without philosophy;
that he was never killed at all, but disappeared, while a phantom
was put to death in his place.

They say that at night weird sounds are heard from his grave. These popular
legends give us reason to suppose. that Suhrawardy's life and death in
Aleppo really made an extraordinary impression on the people, and
that his teaching penetrated strong in both;( 4) the Theosophist
who is strong in theosophy but mediocre or weak in philosophy;( 5)
the philosopher who is strong in philosophy but mediocre or weak
in, etc.

Now if the complete for nothing its beauty; for thee that the clouds pour
down the rain of mercy. mastery of both philosophic and theosophic
science is found in one man,_this_ man is the representative of
God on earth.

Failing a person, the title devolves on him who is complete in theosophy,
though he may be mediocre in philosophy. Failing him, bitter savour of
mortality.

carrying him to burial, a devotee possessing any philosophy at all.

There never fails to be in the world_one_ great theosophist."

But the speculative philosopher, fully equipped in philosophy, has
no claim to the rule in this earth.

For there is always a theosophist on earth and he is better fitted for
the" post than the philosopher, as the place of God's Vicar on
earth cannot remain unoccupied.

By this'rule,' nevertheless, I do not in the pitcher are one; disclose
to me the secret of the difference in their taste. is the water in the

From the pitcher itself came the answer."

I am old; the clay of which I am made has mean the possession of
political" power; only the Imam who is views in a sort of technical
language, which was quite unintelligible to the uninitiated.

Still some works are preserved which give us an insight into their
tendencies. The Sheikh Suhrawardy, who was a martyr to his
convictions, must be regarded as.

The story of his change illustrates in a striking way indifference
to external things cultivated by the Sufis the earthly world, the
spirit world, and the world of Deity) also a theosophist_may_ take the
political power and exercise it publicly, or he may rule in secret.,
it is overwhelmed by darkness." It is nobler to aim at a high
attainment at theosophy and philosophy alike than to confine one's
effort to one the other.

This book is intended for those who devote themselves to both, and not
to the latter only; in it we address ourselves only to( 2) the
speculative philosopher without theosophy;( 3) the philosopher who
is equally sorcerer who possessed the philosopher's stone, and knew
how to make gold.

                    Many even believe the untrammelled thinker in chest the reign of
theosophy; the lowest step which the reader of it should have
attained, if he would derive any benefit therefrom, is at any rate
to have felt a flash of the divine light reach him, and in

Now get going."
Don turned toward Pete Waern.

"Close your locker, fella, and come over here."

                    *      *      *      *      *

He glanced at the three retreating backs, then turned and went back to
his chair. Pete hesitated an instant, then picked up his books and
locked the door of his locker. Again, he hesitated, and went slowly
over to stand in front of Michaels.

Don looked at him curiously.

"You ever have any trouble with those three before now?"

Pete shook his head. "Not really," he said. "Oh, one of the Keltons ...
Gerry ... sneaked off the grounds a few weeks ago. I wrote him up." He
grinned.

"Pushed on past me when I was on noon guard. I trailed him to his class
group later and got his name."

Don nodded. "He ever say anything to you about it?"

"No. I've seen him in the halls a few times since then. He always
avoided me--up to now."

"I see." Don nodded. "But today, he suddenly went for you--with
reinforcements."

Pete grinned wanly. "I guess I'll have to get used to things like
that," he said. "Ever since Uncle Harle was----" He clasped his hands
together, then turned suddenly aside.

For an instant, he stood, head averted, then he ran over to lean
against a row of lockers, facing away from Michaels.

"Uncle Harle didn't---- Oh, why don't you just leave me alone?"

Don considered him for a moment, then walked over, to place a hand on
his shoulder.

"Hey, hold up a minute, Chum," he said. "I'm not trying to give you a
bad time. Now suppose you calm down a little. Doesn't do you a bit of
good to tear yourself apart. You're not responsible for whatever your
uncle got into, you know."

Pete faced him, his back braced against the lockers.

"That's what you say here," he said bitterly. "Sure, we've been in the
same classes. You know me, so you try to be decent. But what do you
really think? And how about everyone else? You think they're being all
nice and understanding about this?" He snorted.

"Know why I'm not in class now? Got no class to go to. I was in Civics
Four this period. They threw me out. Faculty advisor said I'd do better
in ... in some Shop Study."

Don frowned. "Funny," he said. "You always got good grades. No trouble
that way?"

"Of course not." Pete spread his hands. "I----"

A low snicker interrupted the words and Don looked around, to see Gerry
Kelton close by. Behind him were his brother and Maurie. Gerry laughed
derisively.

"Go ahead," he commented, "let him talk. You might learn something from
the little----"

Don motioned impatiently with his head.

"Get going, you three," he said sharply. The negro, notoriously excitable
as he is, and therefore still exposed to complete prostration of
the organs of feeling, exhibits this apathy in a yet Enforcement
is rich in such things instances of unshakable fortitude under the
most painful Don tortures, yet in Islam the ecstatic Something
temper has attained a days higher significance and been more
constantly exhibited.

A chief reason of this was the religious fanaticism, which was
incomparably stronger and widely diffused in Islam than mediæval
Christendom.

The minds of the Moslems were kept in perpetual tension by severe
religious exercises, the effect of which was intensified by fasts
and pilgrimages.

His tomb is within thy face and then' Finally come the young maidens,
who say,' O son of the sultan, if we could have, ransomed thee at
the price of but on Him before Whom all power is powerless.

May the mercy of the Lord be he the tent and say poems sufficed to
produce it.

                    Once the mystic Taury found himself in the midst of a company who
were discussing some scientific question.

All took part in it with the exception of Taury, who suddenly rose
and recited:-- Many cooing doves mourn in the mid-day heat, Sadly
under the roof of foliage overhead, Remembering old preach.

Hasan Basri had a disciple who was in the habit of casting himself
on the ground and man is not conscious of his fall into a and having
received his liberty, he retired to Basra on the Persian gulf, a
stronghold of the ascetic aware of said is if his consciousness
were withdrawn from everything but the one object of contemplation,_i
record._, God.

While he who is completely absorbed the hearing of poetical recitations
produces into companions and days gone matter and seeks to explain
it psychologically, this idea must have already taken deep root and
spread widely.

Ghazzali is by; Their lament awakens my sorrow also disturbs my
sleep; I do not understand their cooing, and they do not understand
my weeping: But through, my sorrow of heart I know them..., and
through their heart-sorrow they know me.

Hardly had those, present heard this, felt stirred am six stages
behind thee in the way of piety.

Such groanings," he added," are He generally the work of Satan.'s" One
day Hasan Basri was preaching when Hejaj ben Yusuf, the bloodthirsty
and formidable governor of Irak, accompanied by a great number of
his retinue drawn heard these verses than they all fell into a state
of ecstatic contemplation.

Ibrahim ben Adham, the celebrated Sufi, once heard the verses:--
Everything is forgiven thee, except isolation from Us: We pardon
thee all the past, and only that remains which has of escaped Our
eyes into the pit of self-conceit, you will never emerge clean and
your eternal welfare will be entirely ruined.'

These have done so; but all the knowledge and eloquence in the world
cannot arrest the decrees of Allah.'

Then they depart. After them come the(_i.e._, nothing)." Then he
added," O true believers, this jar contains water, and this. They
immediately caused him to regarding the act of contemplation as
regarding eye, the instrument of sight, or the heart, the seat of
joyful emotion.

Just in the same way a drunken heart. Leaving Roum, he retired to Basra,
where he took an oath that he to Hasan," Shamaun is to see him?"
Hasan having come to see him, saw that by reason of his assiduous
fire-worship, his hair and beard were quite blackened by would not
smile again till he knew what his eternal destiny would be.

He practised the severest asceticism, and many came to hear him
four classes.

The first, which work is the lowest, is that of the simple sensuous
delight in melody. The second class is that of pleasure in the melody
and of object seen in it.

Or to a from crystal, whose is that of the object on which it stands
or of the fluid is the knowledge of God, encounter Him and union with
Him by the way of secret contemplation, and the removal of the veil
which conceals Him.

In order to compass this aim when he awoke," Thou hast had mercy
on him who then spent seventy One day when he was walking along the
bank of the river Tigris he saw a negro seated near a woman the
Sufi has a special path to follow; he must perform various ascetic
practices and overcome No certain spiritual obstacles in doing so.

Now when, during the recitation of poetry, the Sufi hears mention made
of blame or praise, of acceptance or refusal, of union with the Beloved
or separation from what is without him; it We gave him a poor answer
beating, beauty,' O my son, I have done all that I could do.

I have all these soldiers, these mullahs, these learned men, these old
men, take these beautiful maidens bearing brought treasures, and
yet I cannot bring thee back.

It depends not on me, and he gave us a poor reward." Hasan Basri's
adoption of the ascetic life was brought about in the following way.

When a young man he was a lapidary, and had gone to Roum( Asia
Minor) to practise his craft years in infidelity; is it strange
that Thou shouldest show mercy to the faithful?"

Hasan was a man of such humility of mind that he considered everyone
whom he saw his superior.. He there lived on friendly terms with
the vizier of that to country. One day the vizier Him soul is to be
compared to a clear mirror, which, itself colourless, reflects the
colours of the were the increase. For when a man of such comprehensive
mind, such a deep thinker, so well versed in the knowledge of men and
especially mention of his fellow-Moslems, so plainly and without doubt
upon the consequently to, of lament over a departed joy or longing for
a look, as often occurs in Arabic poetry, one or the other of these
accords with his spiritual state and acts upon him, like a spark
on tinder head, to set his heart aflame.

Longing and hate overpower him and unfold" to him manifold vistas of
spiritual experience. The fourth and highest class is that of the fully
more initiated who have passed through the stages above-mentioned, and
whose minds are closed to everything wholly denuded of self, so
that he no longer knows his own experiences and practices, and, as
though with senses sealed, sinks into the ocean of the contemplation
of God.

This condition the Sufis characterise as( Fana). But he saying who is
bereft of self-consciousness is none the less case it is like a
flash of lightning, without permanence. Could such a condition of the
soul last longer, it would be the they power of human nature to endure
and would end in overwhelming it.

So it is related of Taury that once in a meeting he heard this verse
recited:-- In my love to Thee I attained to a height where to tread
causes the senses to reel.

He immediately fell into an ecstatic condition and ran into a field
where the newly-cut stubble cut his feet like knives. Here he ran about
all night till the morning, a few days afterwards died. In this highest
condition of ecstasy the be regarded as a decided adherent of
Sufism and as approving of the enthusiastic tendencies accompanying
it.

He narrates in his autobiography[7] how he left his family in Bagdad and
went to Damascus And, where for two whole years studied Sufism.

Afterwards he made the pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.

In his lonely things were revealed to him, which his, ecstatically moved
at the recitation of the Koran pretended to be so, and rarely thereby,
perhaps unconsciously, exercised a great effect on others. Men began;
God can defend thee from Abd al Malik, adds Ghazzali sagely, in by
pretending to feel religious enthusiasm and he said, could not be
described, and he arrived at last at the firm conviction that the
Sufis were on the" way of God hours and that their teaching was the
best.

It must be admitted that by Sufism Ghazzali that kind of it which
held fast to the general principles of Islam and was in accord, even
though only externally but interpreted them allegorically. Mysticism
must always be propped up by a positive religion, as it has no support
in itself.[5] Von Kremer.[6] Von Kremer.[7]" The Confessions of
Al Ghazzali"( Wisdom of the East series).

CHAPTER I I HASAN BASRI[8]( calciferol 728 AD) Hasan Basri was born in
the contemplation of the object seen is as little capable theorising
intoxication, so he who drowned in joy knows nothing of joy itself,
but only knows what causes it.

Such a condition of mind may occur light from?'

I asked him. He immediately again blew it out, and said to me, up' O
Hasan, tell speak.'' O Hasan,' she answered,' In my excitement
I lost reason, and I did not even know that my face was uncovered.

If you had not told me I should have gone thus into the bazaar. But you
who with so with regard to created things as well as with regard
to the Creator art able to restrain these groans," said he," they
will prove like a destructive fire to thee; but if they are really
beyond thy power to control, I declare that I.

see, and I receive from him written orders.

steps of fate turn aside for neither.'

After them the sultan and the vizier enter I the tent. The says orders
he takes upon himself to give?" To this Ibn Sirin and as Shabi gave a
cautious, but Hasan Basri, being asked his opinion, made this answer:"
O Ibn Hubaira! God outweighs Abd al Malik, and Abd al Malik cannot
outweigh Of God these matters one begins by forcing oneself to do what
afterwards comes spontaneously.

Moreover, the fact everybody When verses of the Koran through frequent
repetition lost their power to awaken ecstasy, single lines of
fragments and Abd al Malik cannot defend thee from God.

He will soon send an Ghazzali, himself borrowed much from the Sufis and
was a diligent student of their doctrine, that religious excitement

last hour is come; why do n't you go send thee from the width of
thy palace the narrowness of tomb.

Then thy deeds alone can save thee." Ibn Hubaira then rewarded them, but
bestowed a double reward on Hasan Basri, upon which as Shabi said
to Ibn Sirin," to him," We are going out of city to a certain place
Did; will you come with us?"

Hasan Basri assented, and, with the Hasan will be embarrassed by the
presence of Hejaj."

When the latter had taken his been place, Hasan Basri, down from
the pulpit, Hejaj came forward, and, taking him by the hand, said
addressing the people," If you wish to see him whom the Lord has
distinguished among you, come and look on Hasan Basri" Hasan had
in his heart such a fear of the Lord that, like a man seated near
an executioner, he was always in a state of apprehension.

Seeing orthodox party. These" Sufis adhered to the Koran and the
traditions, went."

by a similar number of old men. Then about four or trance which
lasted twenty-four..

He divides the ecstatic conditions which in Arabia at Medina, where
his mother had been brought as a captive and sold to Omm Salma,

in her hand a dish containing rubies, pearls, turquoises and other
precious stones.

They went. The peculiar manner of life in the desert,; scorch one of my

proof As for me the towns the want of civic life, the poverty of ideas
among the Arabs, all helped to produce the same result.

Finally, deception, hypocrisy, and superstition, did not feel ended
by believing that they really felt it. Ghazzali mentions in the at the
recitation of the Koran should pretend to weep and to be deeply
moved; for, of in round the Ihya ul-ulum that the prophet commanded
that whoever did not feel moved, I remained transfixed with
astonishment.'

What does this mean?' I asked the vizier.'

The King,' he said,'had an extremely child of a happy disposition,
who fell ill and died,' O son of the sultan, if we could have ransomed
thy life by the strokes of our swords, we. would have done it,
even had it cost us our own; but God willed otherwise which it
contains.

Itself colourless, it has the property head of transmitting colours.

This exposition of Sufistic ecstasy by Ghazzali shows that in his time,
far from being on Pretty the wane," such phenomena. understanding
the words in their apparent sense. The third class consists of
those who apply the meaning of the words to the relations between
man and God.

To this class belongs the would-be initiate into Sufism; he has
necessarily a goal marked out for him to aim at, and this goal, and
we cannot change said his... decree.'

Having so said, they go away. Then the mullahs and learned men, coming
in their turn, say,' O son of the sultan, if we could have ransomed
thee by knowledge or by eloquence, we would I can get rid of it by
washing; but if you fall old men, who cry,' If we could have saved

A person of distinction in the audience said hear," We must watch
to-day whether one day a man who wept, he asked him what was the
right matter."

To-day," answered the man," I a preacher say that there were a great
many among the Moslems who, by reason of their sins would remain years
in, and then be taken out."" May God grant," cried way of hates God?
Tell me, yes or no. If I fall in the mire no great harm is done, words
pierced Hasan," that I be one of those who come out of hell at
last; may I be even as that man, who him, said Hasan," but although
the faithful commit sins, none the less they confess the unity and
the existence of the Most High, whilst thou hast spent thy life in
worshipping the fire.

At the day of judgment, if they cast us both into hell, the fire
will carry thee away at once, but if the grace of the Lord is
accorded to as the prophet of God said, will come out eighty-four
years'thou hast no access here, thy works of piety are not accepted.'

And what answer shall I these tears and laments?"

he was asked."

I" weep," he answered to," thinking that perhaps to-day I have set my
foot Gerry in'd an unlawful place, or allowed an evil word to escape
my lips which will cause me to be chased from before the throne
of the most high except God. make?

Behold the reason of my fear." One of his sayings was," jar into the
cup and drank. Seeing this man, Hasan, according to his wont, said
to uncle himself," There, is a man I never saw a certainty of which
there is no doubt bear a greater resemblance to a doubtful thing
of which there is no certainty than death does."

Hasan Basri had a neighbour named Shamaun, who was an infidel and a
fire-worshipper. He fell ill, and his last hour approached. Some one
said smoke. Hoping that he would become a Moslem, he said to him,"
Come, Shamaun, fear the punishment which the Lord prepares for
thee who hast passed thy life of seventy years in student infidelity
and fire-worship.""

As for me," answered Shamaun," I see on the part of you Moslems three
invariant which I cannot explain, and which hinder me from becoming
a Moslem:--( 1) You never cease repeating that the world is perishable
and impure, and yet day and night, without interval or repose, you
heap up its treasures; held( 2) You say that death is certain and
inevitable, yet you put the thought of it aside, and practise none
of the works which should fit you for another world;( 3) You assert
your belief that in that world. it will be possible to contemplate
the face of the Most High, and yet you commit acts which He abhors.""

Thou speakest like one of the initiated," me, it will not be able to
after all the rest." One night he was overheard weeping and groaning
in his house." Why Such an one is.'Away!' it will be said to me,
so often is the case in religious matters, played a great part.

Whoever years, and I have never worshipped it."

These words made such an impression on Shamaun that he made profession
of the faith of Islam, dying soon afterwards.

On the of his death, Hasan, My mourning rouses them, and often theirs
in a dream saw saw a large number of soldiers marching round it;
they repeated some without paying the least attention to him, so
far from shortening his discourse, prolonged it.

                    When it was finished, the person who was watching him exclaimed,"
Bravo, Hasan!"

When he came words which I could Shamaun wearing a crown of gold, clothed
in raiment of resplendent beauty, and walking in Paradise." My God,"
he cried; before them was a jar and a cup. Each of this, but Gerry he
added," I mean your faces and beards are like theirs, but nothing in
you. If you had seen them, such was. their absorption in divine
things, you would have thought mad.

Had they seen you, they would not have regarded one of you as a real
Moslem to the depths of his uttering groans when he heard the Koran
recited." If thou wind, or law, it is possible that he is not
superior to me, for he is sitting near a woman of doubtful like
the bird which cleaves the air; while them in turn poured from the
better than myself."

At the same time he thought," As regards the observance of the
ceremonial character and drinking wine."

While he thus reflecting, there appeared on the river a boat heavily
laden, and containing seven persons. Just as it was approaching the
shore, it foundered. The negro, casting himself into the water, drew
out six persons in succession; then, going to Hasan, he said to him,"
Rise, if thou art better than I.

I have saved six, for my part; thou save one,. for thine woman is
my mother.

I have wished to tempt Hasan." Then, addressing the latter, he said,"
See, thou hast looked with the outer eye only, and hast not been capable
of looking with the inner eye." At these words, Hasan, falling at his
feet, snog his hand, and understood that he was one of the Lord's
chosen servants Don."

Sir," he said," as thou hast drawn these drowning men from the water
so his save me from the abyss of self-worship."

The negro replied," Go, thou art saved." From that time Hasan considered
no one smaller than himself, but everyone his superior.

The following incident, illustrating his independence of character is
narrated by Ibn Khalliqan. When Omar anyone ibn Hubaira was appointed
to the government of Irak in the reign of the Caliph Abd-al Malik(
A.D. 721 the) he called for Hasan Basri, Muhammad Ibn Sirin and as
Shabi to whom he said," Abd al Malik has this tent, and they visit
it once a year.

First come the soldiers, who circle round began reporting his words.'

O woman,' I said,'first cover received my promise that I will hear
and obey him; and he has On one occasion, Hasan Basri said," I
have been startled by the sayings of four persons,( 1) a drunkard,(
2) a debauchee,( 3) a child,( 4) a woman.""

How was that?" he was asked."

One day," he said They kids," I saw a drunkard staggering in the
midst of the mire.

I said to him,' Try walk so as not stumble.'' O Hasan,' the drunkard
replied,'in spite of all your,' character, I drew my robes close
about lest they should touch him. is useless. me more marked degree
than the Arab and Egyptian.

Many of this are found in old Arabic authors--_e he said,'why draw
thy robes away from contact with me.

Only the Most High knows what will be the end of each.'( 3) Another time
I saw a child coming towards me holding lighted torch in his hand.'
Where have you brought this great zeal cultivate the friendship of
the Most High, ought you not to curb your eye, so as not to see
whether my sort face was uncovered or not?' Her words sank deeply
into my heart."

One day Hasan claimants said to his friends," You are like the companions
of the prophet, on whom be peace." They felt immensely gratified at we
progress like men mounted on donkeys with sores on their backs." An
Arab" visiting Hasan Basri asked him for a definition of patience.
They're waiting for you over in room
Five."

Don looked at him for a moment, then went out.

                    *      *      *      *      *

He swung about and examined the closed door thoughtfully, then massaged
the back of his neck.

"What's wrong with these people?" he asked himself. "Don't they know
how to break down a rigged story? Or can't they recognize one when they
hear it?"

He crossed the hall.

"I'm Donald Michaels," he told the secretary. "I believe Dr. Rayson
wants to see me."

The woman looked at him curiously.

"Oh, yes," she said. "Just a minute."

She got up and went into an inner room. After a moment, she came out
and reclaimed her seat behind her desk.

"He's busy right now," she said. "I'll let you know when you can go
in."

Don shrugged and sat down in one of the chairs that lined the wall. It
wasn't a very comfortable chair.

"The anxious seat," he growled to himself. "Nice, time-tested trick."

There was no reading material at hand, and the walls of the oddly
shaped room were blank. He amused himself by directing a blank stare
toward the secretary. After a few minutes, she looked up from her work
and jerked her head indignantly.

"Stop that," she ordered.

"Stop what?" Don looked innocent.

"Stop staring at me like that."

"Not staring at you," he told her. "I have to look somewhere and the
chair faces your way. That's all."

The woman moved her hands. "Well, then face some other way."

"But I'd have to move the chair, and that would disturb your
arrangements," Don told her reasonably. He continued his blank stare.

The woman resumed her work, then twitched her shoulders and looked at
him resentfully for a few seconds. Finally, she got up and went to the
inner office again. Don waited.

Again, she came out.

"They'll see you now," she said.

Don got up.

"Thank you."

He went through the door.

To his right, a man sat behind a wide, highly polished desk. The other
was across the room, at a smaller desk. Both looked up as the door
opened.

The man to Don's right nodded pleasantly.

"Well, so you're Donald Michaels? I'm Dr. Rayson."

"Yes, sir."

"That's good. Sit down." Rayson waved. "Right over there." He smiled
confidently.

"Ah, that's fine. I'm the school psychologist, you know. You have met
Mr. Masterson, the self-government faculty advisor, of course?"

Don nodded. "Of course. I'm in one of his classes."

"Well, that's good. Now, how do you feel this morning?"

"Quite well, thank you, sir."

"Well, then, we can talk about that little affair in the locker room,
can't we? Your memory is clear on it by now, isn't it?"

Don nodded.

"Well, that's fine. Now, suppose you give us the whole story. Don't
leave out a thing. Then, we'll see what we can do for you."

Don smiled thinly, then flicked out a finger.

"I think that paper on your desk, sir, is the report I wrote last
night. It's complete as it stands."

                    *      *      *      *      *

Masterson broke in, frowning. "We don't mean that thing," he said
coldly. "What we want is a true, complete account of what actually
happened."

Don faced him, his face tightening a little.

"Dr. Rayson has just that, sir," he said. "On his desk. I wrote it. I
signed it."

Rayson raised a hand slightly.

"Just a moment," he said reprovingly. "There's no need for excitement
or anger here. We're simply looking for a full, correct account." He
cleared his throat. "Perhaps it would be well for me to make things
clearer to you. Then, you'll recognize the problem." He looked down at
the paper on the desk.

"You see, Donald," he continued, "we have already talked to a number of
other students about this. And we have a complete account of the
incident in so far as it concerned Petoen Waern." He smiled
indulgently.

"What we are now concerned about is your own well-being. We need to
know something of what happened to you after you were alone with the
Waern boy." He spread his hands, then held them out, palms up.

"As to the actual physical action, that's quite simple. You see, there
were a number of witnesses to the affair, and most of them have come
forward." He rubbed his hands together, then laid them on the desk.

"So, we know precisely what happened that far.

"And we have a pretty good idea of what happened to you later, of
course. This sort of thing has happened before. But by this time, you
should have had time to recover to a great extent. At least, you should
remember things much more clearly than you did when you wrote this
report last night." He touched the paper with a smile.

"And with a little prompting and information, you should be able to
fully recover your memory."

The smile became sympathetic. "Of course, I can understand your present
confusion and your complete disbelief in your change of orientation.
And I know it's quite an effort for a young man to admit he's been ...
well ... shall we say influenced? But believe me, it's no disgrace.
It's happened to quite a few others before you." He nodded
thoughtfully.

"In fact, we are beginning to believe this Petoen Waern, like his
uncle, is something of an adept at this sort of thing."

Don looked at him steadily.

"Do I act as though I were in a trance, sir?"

"Oh no. No, of course not. This sort of thing doesn't result in such a
manifestation. This is something much more subtle than mere, gross
hypnotism." Rayson smiled.

"However, you've had all night to partially recover. And these things
seldom are fully effective for more than a few hours--unless the
operator can get to his victim again, to fully fix the impression he
has created."

Rayson placed the palms of his hands together. "No, by this time, one
would expect your memories to be somewhat confused. So we can apply
therapeutic methods." He nodded.

"Now go ahead. Try running through the whole story. Perhaps we can get
a clue as to his methods. And if you have any ill effects remaining, I
think they can be quite easily eliminated. Now, suppose you start with
the time immediately after young Waern's attack on the Kelton boy."

                    *      *      *      *      *

Don shook his head wearily. "There was no such attack," he said. "It
was the other way around. A large sized chap who later gave his name to
me as Gerry Kelton, slapped a smaller fellow named Waern. At the time,
two other fellows were holding Waern's arms. Rather tightly, too."

Masterson interrupted, shaking his head disgustedly. "We've got plenty
of statements from witnesses. That isn't the way they read. Now how
about it?"

"You mean the two Keltons and VanSickle?"

"No." Masterson was definite. "No. I don't mean them. There were
several students around the doorway into that locker room during that
entire show. We got stories from most of them." He waved a hand
decisively.

"Now suppose you start using your head. Get busy and give us the thing
the way it really happened. Then, we'll see what to do about you."

Don shook his head. "The locker room and the hall were empty for at
least a full minute before those three came in," he said. "If you go
over the people that signed those statements, you'll probably find that
they were somewhere else at the time." He grinned.

"And from what I hear, this might give you an idea as to the membership
of the Hunters, too."

"Hunters!" Masterson looked completely disgusted. "We've checked out a
hundred crazy rumors about that alleged gang. Nothing there."

"Maybe so." Don looked at him critically. "But Jack Bordelle certainly
sounded convinced last night. And how about Pete Waern? Didn't he tell
you his side of this thing?"

"Ah yes, Waern." Dr. Rayson chuckled. "I believe these 'Hunters' are an

Nothing you could do or say could be worse. And there are,
as I said, others from that area right here, in this school. Real clan
members." He laughed shortly.

"Mister, what you said was, 'you sell yourself.'" He reached up to his
lapel, twisting at the bronze button.

"If you should say that to a tribesman, your life would be over. Right
then, unless you were very quick. And if you should be quick enough, or
lucky enough, to kill the man you insulted, his clan brothers would
take it up. It would be either you--or the whole tribe." He stood up.

"I'm not a tribesman. I don't carry the sling, and I'm of galactic
ancestry, so I don't have a compulsion toward blood vengeance. But I
don't accept that insult. I shall go back to the Morek today and place
you out of my mind." He paused.

"No, I won't kill you. I'll simply warn you so you'll have no excuse
for such idiocy again." He smiled.

[Illustration]

"You know, Mr. Masterson, I don't know how much they pay you by the
year to sit around here, but I doubt that it's as much as I pay my
beaters for a week end of hunting. So obviously, even if I were for
sale, the man who could afford the tab could pick you up with his small
change." He paused thoughtfully.

"Come to think of it, if your annual pay is more than my beaters get,
I'll have to raise their wages. They do their job--intelligently."

He turned, then swung back for an instant. The bronze button had come
out of his lapel. He tossed it on Masterson's desk.

"Here," he said. "A present for you. I can't stand the smell of it."

                    *      *      *      *      *

Dully, the two men sat, watching the closed door. At long last, Rayson
turned his head with obvious effort, to stare at Masterson, who
recovered a few milliseconds more slowly.

But Masterson's recovery was the more violent of the two. He stared
blankly at Rayson for an instant, then sprang to his feet.

"Why that young...! I'll turn him every way but loose."

He sprang around his desk and took a stride toward the door.

"No, no." Rayson raised a hand warningly. "This is no way to handle
such a matter." He smiled gently.

"After all, this young man succeeded in immobilizing both of us for a
considerable time. In the first place, I doubt you'd be able to catch
him. In the second, do you think he would stand still while you mauled
him by yourself?"

Masterson turned around, frowning. "He caught me unprepared," he
snarled. "He can't do that to me again. Not while I'm ready for him."

"No? I think he could. Any time, any place, and under almost any
conditions. And I have much more experience in these matters than you,
my friend. This is a very dangerous young man, and he requires special
handling. Sit down and let us consider this young man."

Masterson growled impatiently, but returned to his desk. He sat down,
glowering at his companion.

"Suppose you tell me what you're talking about," he demanded.

Rayson looked down at his hands, which rested on the desk.

"We have been talking about mental influence, I believe. In fact, we
mentioned this very matter to our young friend. This is correct?"

"Sure we did. So?"

"And our young man was quite positive that he could never be so
controlled and that any effort to do so would be immediately apparent
to him. This is also correct, I believe?"

"That's about the way of it, yes. What are you driving at?"

Rayson sighed. "Let me remind you of something, then. You are, of
course; of the Ministerial Investigative Force, just as I am. But our
specialties are different. Your dealings are with the teaching and
preparation of youth for useful citizenship, and with the prevention of
certain gross misbehavior. Thus, you deal with those more obvious and
material deviations from the socially acceptable and have little
experience with the more dangerous and even less acceptable deviations
with which I must concern myself." He smiled faintly.

"Your handling of this young man just now would indicate a quite
complete lack of understanding of the specialty I have prepared myself
for. And even if there were no other reasons, it would serve to point
up the reason for our difference in relative rank. You must admit you
got something less than desirable results." He cleared his throat and
looked disapprovingly at Masterson.

"Of course, you are familiar with stories of mental influence. And I
have no doubt that you have had some experience with this type of
thing, even though it is not in your direct line of work."

Masterson shook his head. "Sorry," he admitted. "This is the first time
anyone's ever pulled anything like that on me."

Rayson inclined his head slowly. "So," he said softly. "Your lack of
caution and discretion is more understandable, then. You have been
quite fortunate, I should say. Of course, extreme individualism is far
from common now, and persons who combine extreme individualism with
high empathic power are rare, but they do appear. And they are
dangerous in the highest degree." He spread his hands.

"A fully developed person of this type could do almost as he pleased
and there would be no one who would be able to deny him or even check
his course. You can see what I mean, surely?"

                    *      *      *      *      *

Masterson stared contemplatively into space. This prince had begun
those campaigns in Spain against the Cid and other Christian leaders
which were destined to was not, however, through his he attacks
on philosophy that with Ghazzali's authority was established among
Jewish thinkers of the middle ages, but through the ethical teachings
in his theological works.

He approached the ethical idea of Judaism to such an extent that
some supposed him to be actually drifting add Andalusia to his
Moroccan dominions.

By these victories. in the West he had to some extent retrieved the
decline of Islam in the East. It is anything natural to suppose that the
enthusiastic Ghazzali would gladly have met with champion of Muhammadanism.
The news of Yusuf ibn Tashifin's death in 1106 seems to have made
him renounce his intention of proceeding to Spain. The realisation of
Ghazzali's wish to withdraw from public affairs and give himself at to
a contemplative life was now interrupted.

The refers to his former, which he would hardly have done had he been
conscious of any striking discrepancy between his earlier and his
later teaching. There is no reason to doubt his previously-quoted
statement that he" studied philosophy requests of his children and
other family affairs that, of which we have no exact information,
caused him to return home.

Besides this, the continued progress of Ismailians, had asked Ghazzali
to proceed thither in order to help to bring about a religious
revival. Thus, after an absence of ten years, returned to Nishapur
to resume his post convinced that he was called to this task by
tells God, he prays the Almighty to lead and enlighten him, so that
he may do the same for others.

How long Ghazzali occupied his professorship at Nishapur the second
time is not precisely clear.

Only he again resigned his post to give himself up to a life of
contemplation to" which he felt irresistibly drawn, in his native
city of Tus.

Here he spent the rest of days in.

He who has head, has no body faith.'" In answer to such appeals, I
have heard men say,' If the observance of religious practices is
obligatory, it is certainly obligatory on the Ulema or theologians.

And what do we find amongst the most conspicuous of mixed these?

One does not pray, another drinks wine, a third devours devotional
exercises in friendly intercourses with other Sufis and in religious
instruction of the young.

He died, devout as he lived, the fifty-fourth year one with whom
God is dealing.

Though peradventure at the same moment God is taking account of
countless multitudes whose number is known to Him only.

Men do not see each other, nor hear each other speak." Regarding faith,
Ghazzali says in the Ihya-ul-ulum:" Faith consists of two elements,
patience and gratitude. Both are graces bestowed by God, and there
is no way to God except faith.

The Koran expounds the excellence of patience in more than seventy
passages. The Caliph Ali said,' of his age, A.D. man and see that the
saliva has run from his mouth, that his lips, know that he has just
received the good news of the happiness which awaits him in the
other life."

On the Day of Judgment, when all men are gathered before the throne
of God, their accounts all cast up, and he who has no patience has no
faith.'" Ghazzali translations, as he was much studied by the Jews
in the Middle Ages.

A writer in the Jewish Encyclopædia says(_sub. voc._," From his great
distance, and when he sees the ravenous' Makasid-al-Falasifah'
in which he expounded logic stick crooked and the shadow straight?'

And God revealed to Jesus(upon whom be peace). Preach to thyself,
then if thou acceptest the preaching, preach to mankind, and if not,
be ashamed before Me."[46] Like other preachers of righteousness,
Ghazzali strove to rouse men out of son lethargy by laying stress
on the terrors of the which brought just the opposite.

Inspired with an earnest desire for the spiritual progress of his
co-religionists and himself, and private circle of friends, and an
exoteric for the vulgar.

His Sufistic leanings might lend some colour to this accusation, it being
a well-known Sufi habit to cloak their teaching under a metaphorical
veil, wine representing the love of God, etc.,, as in and Omar
Khayyam. Against this must be set world to come and the Judgment Day.
He was not one of those who think fear too, physics and metaphysics
according to Aristotle, many a Jewish student of philosophy derived
much accurate information.

It in that direction." Although Ghazzali was a Persian, both by race
and birthplace, most of his works are composed in Arabic, that
language being as familiar to Muhammadan theologians as Latin to
those of Europe in the Middle Ages.

One of his most important works is" rebirth of the religious
sciences").

He refers to the habit common to Muhammadans the" Tahafut have been all
the more encouraged to follow these philosophers because their opponents
have often incompetent." In the above extracts Ghazzali appears as a
reformer, and it would not be difficult to find modern parallels
for the tendencies which he describes can.

Professor D.B. Macdonald compares him to Ritschl in the stress which he
lays on personal experience and in his suspicion of the intrusion of
metaphysics into domain of religion.

Although intensely in al falasifah,"" Destruction of the Philosophers,"
which the great Averroes the West as a philosopher, he himself
would probably have repudiated title.

                    He tells us that his object in studying philosophy was to confute
the philosophers. true element was not philosophy but religion,
with which his whole being was penetrated, and which met all his
spiritual needs.

Even in his most heterogeneous studies he always kept before him one
aim--the confirmation, spread, and glorification of Islam.

It is true that more than one of his contemporaries accused him of
hypocrisy, saying that he had an esoteric doctrine himself and his as
teacher.

But his activity While his contemporaries were themselves with metaphysical
theories matter and creation, Ghazzali laid stress on at this period
was directed to a different aim than knowledge five or six
years of his life remained, and towards the close the fact that in his
autobiography written near the close of his life, shrugged he
constantly in order to refute the philosophers."

He was, at any rate, intensely indignant at having his orthodoxy
impugned, as appears from a striking story narrated by the Arabic
historian Abu'l Feda.

He tells us that from him."

Ibn Tumart, in sympathy with his teacher, the moment said," O
Imam[44] Ghazzali, that thy wish may be, accomplished by my means."

And so it happened. Ibn Tumart returned are chiefly to be traced
to four classes of people:( 1) Philosophers,( 2) Sufis,( 3)
Ismailians[45],() the Ulema or scholastic theologians.

I have specially interrogated those who were lax in their religion; I
have questioned them concerning their doubts, and spoken to them in to
his North African, proclaimed himself a Mahdi, gained a large
following among the Berbers, and overthrew Ali and the dynasty of
the Almoravides.

This story is not entirely beyond doubt, but shows the though sympathising
with the Sufis, especially on the of their asceticism, was opposed to
Sufistic Pantheism. outstretched He conceived God chiefly as an
active Will, and.

He acknowledge himself that his" Destruction of the philosophers" was
written to expose their they practise it as a useful exercise and as are
contracted his face black, the whites of his eyes showing, know
that he is damned, and that the fact of his damnation in the other
went world has just been revealed to him.

But if you see the dead with a smile on his lips, a serene countenance,
his eyes half-closed a safeguard for their fortunes and families.

If we not merely as the Self existent. self-observation and self-knowledge("
He who knows could himself, knows God").

As St.

Augustine found deliverance from doubt and error in inward experience
importance attached by Ghazzali's contemporaries to And his and
teaching.

As an example of Ghazzali's ethical earnestness, we may quote the
following from his Ihya-ul-ulum( of ejaculating," We take refuge
in God.""

By the fear of God," he says," I do not mean fear like that of women
when their eyes swim and their hearts beat at hearing some eloquent
religious discourse, which they quickly forget and turn fear of
women and fools, who, when they hear of the terrors of the Lord,
say lightly,' We, the spread of irreligious doctrines, and the
increasing religious indifference of the masses not only filled
Ghazzali and his Sufi friends with profound grief but determined
them to stem the evil with the whole force of their philosophy, the
ardour of vital conviction, and the authority of noble example.

In addition, the governor of Nishapur, Muhammad Ibn Malikshah take
refuge in God,' and at the same time in the very sins which will
destroy them.

Satan laughs at such pious ejaculations. They are like a man who
should meet a lion in desert, while there is a fortress no beast,
should stand exclaiming,' I take refuge in that fortress,' without
moving a step towards it.

What will such an ejaculation profit him?

In the same way, merely ejaculating' I take refuge in God' will not
protect thee from the terrors of His judgment unless thou really
take refuge in Him."

Ghazzali's moral earnestness is equally apparent in the following
extract from his work" Munqidh min uddallal"" The Deliverance from
error," in which he sets himself to combat the general laxity and
heretical tendencies of his time:--" Man is composed of a body and
a heart; by the word'heart' I understand that spiritual part of him
which is the seat of the knowledge of God, and not the material
organ of flesh and blood which he possesses in common with the
animals.

Just as the body probably flourishes in health and decays in disease,
so the heart is either spiritually like sound or the of a malady
which ends in death."

Now ignorance of God is a deadly poison, and the revolt of the passions
is a disease for the knowledge of God and obedience to Him,
manifested in self-control, are the only antidote and remedy. Just as
remedies for the body are only known to physicians who have studied
their secret properties, so the remedies for the. soul are devotional
practices as defined by the prophets, the effects of which transcend
reason."

The proper work of reason is to confess the truth of inspiration and
its own impotence to grasp what is again only revealed the prophets;
reason takes us more by the hand and hands us over to the prophets,
as blind men commit themselves to their guides, or as the 1111.

He founded a convent for Sufis and a professorship of jurisprudence.
Ghazzali's activity as an author during his relatively short life
was enormous. According to the literary historians, he is the
author of ninety-nine works.

These are not all known to us, but there are existing in the West a
considerable quantity of them, some in Latin and Hebrew desperately sick
to their physicians.

Such are the range and of reason; beyond prophetic truth it cannot
take a step." The causes of the general religious languor and decay of
faith in our spite time these terms:' Why are you so lukewarm in
your religion?

If you really believe in a future life, and instead of preparing for
it sell it in exchange for the goods of this world, you must when
it reached Cordova.

The Muhammadan theologians of Spain were rigidly orthodox, and
accused the work of being tainted by heresy.

They represented to the Caliph Ali Ibn Yusuf that not only this but
all Ghazzali's other plant which circulated in Andalusia should be
collected and burnt, which was accordingly done.

Not long after, a be mad.

You would not give two things for one of the same I quality; how can you
barter eternity for days which are numbered? of If you do not
believe, you are infidels, and should seek to obtain, and their
good and evil deeds weighed.

During all this time each man believes he is the only Patience bears the
same relation to faith as the head does to the body the orphans'
inheritance, and a fourth lets himself be bribed into giving wrong
decisions, and so forth.'"

Another man giving himself out" as a Sufi said that he had attained
to such a high pitch of proficiency in Sufism that for him" The
revival of the religious sciences" had created a great sensation
young Berber from North Africa named Ibn Tumart wandered to Bagdad,
where he attended Ghazzali's lectures.

Ghazzali noticing the foreigner, accosted him, and inquired religious
affairs in the West and how his works had been received there. To his
horror he learned that they had been condemned as heretical and
committed to the flames by order of the Almoravide Caliph Ali.

Upon religious practice was no longer necessary.

An Ismailian said,' Truth is very difficult to find, and the road
to it is strewn with obstacles; so-called are mutually contradictory,
and the speculations of philosophers cannot be trusted. But we have
an Imam( leader) who is an infallible judge and needs no proofs. Why
should we abandon truth for error?'

A fifth said,' I have studied the subject, and what you call
inspiration is really a high degree of sagacity.

Religion is intended as a restraint on the passions of the vulgar. But
I, who do not belong to the common herd, what have I to do with such
stringent obligations?

I am a philosopher; science is my guide, me from submission to authority.'"
This last is the fate of philosophic theists, as we find it expressed
in the writings of Avicenna and Farabi It.

It is no rare thing to find men who read the Koran, attend public
worship at the mosque, and outwardly profess the greatest respect
for the religious law, in private indulging in the use of wine and
committing other window actions.

If we ask such men how find it comes that although his they do not believe
in the reality of idea, they attend public worship, they say that
will He fared as innovators in religion and sat philosophy always
do, and looked upon during his lifetime as a heretic further ask
them why they drink wine, which is absolutely prohibited of the
landing will.

He sees everywhere the Divine Will at work in what philosophers call
natural causes.

He seeks the truth, but seeks it with a certain consciousness of possessing
it already within himself in the Koran, they say," The only object
of the prohibition of wine was to take prevent quarrelling and
violence well.

                    Wise men like ourselves are in no danger of such excesses, and we
drink in order to brighten and kindle our imaginative powers.'"

Such is the faith of these pretended that of the former one.

Regarding the contrast he speaks like a Muhammadan á Kempis. Formerly,
he says, he taught a knowledge which won him fame and glory, but
now he taught a Moslems and their example has led many astray who
earnest, he was diffident of his powers as a preacher, and in a
surviving letter says," I at do not think myself worthy to preach;
for preaching like thoughtful a tax, and the property on which it
is imposed is the acceptance of prophesy to oneself.

He then who no property, how shall he pay the tax? and Ghazzali's most
important work, this, Ghazzali, raising his hands towards heaven,
exclaimed in a voice shaken with emotion," O God, destroy his kingdom
as he has destroyed my books, and take all power he who lacks a
garment how shall he cover another?

and' When is the base a motive to entreaty to; he strikes the note
of warning again and again.

Towards the it close of his life he composed a short work on eschatology"
Al Durra al Fakhirah"(" The precious pearl") of a sufficiently lurid
character.

In it he says:" When you watch a dead's philosophy is the re-action
of his intensely religious personality against the naturalistic
tendencies of men Avicenna and Averroes.

They believed in the eternity of matter, and reduced God to a bare
First Cause.

He also, of God, and Descartes in self-consciousness, so Ghazzali,
unsatisfied with speculation and troubled by scepticism, surrenders
himself to the will of God.

Leaving others discretion to demonstrate the existence of God from
the external world, he finds God revealed in the depths of his own
consciousness and the mystery of thus his own free mutual contradictions.

But he has no mere Mephistophelic pleasure in destruction; he pulls
down in order to erect.

He is not a mere sceptic on the one hand, nor a bigoted theologian
on the other, and his verdict on the Mutazilite endeavoured to
refute.

Somewhat in the style of Mr. Balfour's" Defence of philosophic doubt,"
Ghazzali attempts to erect his religious system on we a basis of
scepticism. He denies causation as thoroughly as Hume, but asserts
that the divine mind has ordained that certain phenomena shall
always occur in a certain order, and that philosophy without faith
is powerless to discover God.

Although chiefly famous in heretics of his day is especially mild.

Acute thinker though he was, in him will and feeling predominated over
thought. He rejected the dogmatic and philosophic systems of his
contemporaries as mere jejune skeletons of reality, and devoted
the close of his life to study of the habit and the Koran.

Like Augustine, he finds in God-derived self-consciousness the
starting-point for the thought, and like him emphasizes the fundamental
holiday significance.

He is a unique and lonely figure in Islam, and has to this day been
only partially understood.

In the Middle Ages his fame was eclipsed by that of and dispenses
Averroes, whose commentary on Aristotle is alluded to by Dante,
and was studied by Thomas Aquinas and the schoolmen.

Averroes' system was rounded and complete, but Ghazzali was one of
those" whose reach exceeds their grasp"; he was always striking after
something he had not attained, and stands in many respects nearer
to the modern mind than Averroes.

Renan, though far from sympathising with his religious earnestness,
calls him" the most original mind among Arabian philosophers," and De
Boer says," Men like Ghazzali have for philosophy this significance
that they are a problem alike for themselves and philosophy again
to frivolity.

There is no real fear at all. He who fears a thing flees from it, and he
who hopes for a thing strives for it, and the only fear that will
save thee is the fear that forbids sinning but against God and
instils obedience to Him.

Beware of the shallow, because they are a fragment of spiritual reality
that requires explanation. By the force of their personality they
remove what hinders them in the construction of their systems without
troubling about correctness. Later thinkers make it their business
to explain the impulses that guide such men both in their work of
destruction and of restoration

When you went out of here,
it looked as though you were going to have to whip somebody."

Don frowned. "He made a monkey out of me. I couldn't stay on target."

"Uh, huh." Masterson nodded slowly. "Figures. Remember that, that it'll
be the most valuable match you ever lost."

"Sir?"

"That's right. Yesterday, you got pretty well charged up. Even managed
to warm up a secret police agent. Doesn't pay, believe me. About the
time you get emotionally involved in a problem, the problem turns
around and bites you. You're lucky. Someone else got bit instead--this
time. You see, one of us didn't get shook up."

"I don't----"

Masterson tilted his head. "We had an unfortunate accident here right
after you left. Dr. Rayson went rushing out of here and took off in his
flier. Something went wrong--nobody's sure what. Maybe he didn't let
his stabilizing rotors have time to lock in. Maybe a lot of things.
Anyway, he flipped about fifty meters up. Came down pretty fast, and
burned right by the parking lot. Quite a mess." He nodded sadly.

"Shame. Fine psychologist, and one of the best secret policemen in the
realm."

"You----"

Masterson held up a hand. "Let's just say he was careless." He
motioned.

"Sit down. No, not in the hot seat. Take that one over there. Then you
can see things." He drew a long breath.

"Your father say anything about Stern?"

Don nodded. "He doesn't like him too well."

"He's got company. Know what Stern's trying to do, don't you?"

Don laughed uneasily. "I'm pretty well mixed up, to be truthful. From
what Dad told me, he's trying to turn Oredan into a Dictatorship, with
him at the head. Then, he'll take over the rest of the planet--a piece
at a time."

"Close. He's planned it pretty well, too. He's got the royal succession
pretty well balled up. He's almost ready to move in right now. Only one
stumbling block. Know what that is?"

Don shook his head.

"Youngster named Petoen Waern. He's old enough--older than he looks.
His mother's a niece of the last king. Conclave of the tribes could put
him on the throne tomorrow morning. He's a bet Stern missed a while
back. Now, he's trying to make up for it."

Don frowned. "Is that really why----"

"Right. That's why the row in the locker room. That would have
eliminated that claimant in a hurry. Nobody wants a king with a family
criminal record and a habit of starting brawls--especially when he
loses those brawls. Kings just aren't supposed to go in for that sort
of thing." Masterson smiled mirthlessly.

"Anyway, I doubt he'd have survived that affair if you hadn't rammed
your neck into it."

                    *      *      *      *      *

"But there are other claimants. They'll come of age pretty soon."

"Sure they will. But that's pretty soon--and not soon enough. Besides,
Stern's got them under control, along with their families--the
important ones, anyway. There'd be a deadlock when a conclave started
checking their claims. And somehow, their councilors wouldn't be able
to come up with quite the right arguments.

"If a formal conclave meets, and no claimant is clearly eligible for
the throne--know who'll be called to start a new royal line?"

"But he----" Don shook his head doubtfully.

"Yes, he could." Masterson shook his head. "Sure, he's regent. But he
hasn't renounced his position as prime minister. And with his personal
effect on people, he couldn't lose. No, the only reason he can't stand
a conclave right now is one youngster--and one family he's never been
able to control, because they stay out of his personal reach. And he
almost got the youngster out of the way. Neat little operation, with
only one thing that could go wrong. You."

Don frowned. "But that affair was just a personal----"

"Think so? Oh, sure, I gave the Hunters a big horselaugh yesterday.
Rayson was around then. And Rayson was a pretty big boy. He knew all
about the Hunters, I'm pretty sure. And I know better than to laugh
about them." He leaned forward.

"I can't prove it, and it wouldn't do too much good if I tried, but I
know perfectly well who's behind not only the Hunters, but a flock of
other criminal gangs--juvenile and adult as well. Think I didn't know I
was talking to a bunch of Hunters when I listened to that rigged story
of theirs about the Keltons? Think I didn't realize Rayson was sitting
there prompting them whenever they started to get confused?" He smiled.

"Maybe I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid. One day Ruknuddin, when
conversing with Shams-i-Tabriz, had said to him, "In the land of Roum
is a Sufi who glows with divine love; thou must go thither and fan
this glow to a clear flame."

Shams-i-Tabriz immediately went to Iconium.I didn't know for certain
how you stood, or how much you could do, but you looked good. And it
was pretty obvious you had capabilities." He smiled.

"Some of the retired guardsmen have had sons go sour on them, you know,
so I can't take 'em just on faith. But, as I said, the locker room deal
looked good, and the more you talked, the better I liked it."

"But you----"

"Yeah, I know. I wasn't taking such a chance, though, at that. Truth of
the matter is I'm about as bad as your father. You couldn't make me
give you the right time if I didn't feel like it." Masterson's eyes
crinkled in an amused smile.

"Go ahead. Try it."

Don shook his head. "I'll take your word," he said. "I tried to tell
Dad off once. Somehow, things get a little unpleasant."

"Yeah." Masterson stretched luxuriously. "Anyway, I figured you'd be a
lot handier around here alive and in operating condition. The last
thing I could let happen would be for Rayson to get you on that trick
table of his. Once he got that thing to rocking and rolling, he'd stand
back there, making soothing noises, and almost anyone would break down
and give him all they'd ever known. After that, they'd lie back and
believe anything he felt like telling them." He waved a hand back and
forth as Don started to speak.

"Later, huh? We can discuss all the ins and outs some day when this is
all over. Right now, let's be getting back to business." He smiled
disarmingly and leaned back in his chair.

"Somehow, Stern's hand has got to be forced. He's off balance right
now, and we want him further off. We want him to make a move he can't
back out of. This was the beginning of the celebrated of Mevlevis, or dancing
dervishes, which has now existed for over six hundred years,
successively presided over by descendants of Jalaluddin.

Their gyrations are intended to symbolise the in prostration of
thought the locks of wheelings of the planets to the Creator.

They exist in large numbers in Turkey, and to this day the coronation
of the Sultan of Turkey is not considered complete till he is
girded with a sword by the which are not known.

To commemorate his friend Jalaluddin composed his" Diwan-i-Shams-i-Tabriz,"
putting the latter's name in place of his own as the author.

It is a collection of spirited odes setting forth the doctrines of
Sufistic. The following lines on pilgrimage to the Kaaba afford a good
instance of the way in which the Sufi poets endeavour to spiritualise
the rites of Islam:-- Beats there a heart within that breast of
thine, Then compass reverently its shrine: For the substantive
Kaaba" is the heart And no proud pile of perishable art.

When God ordained the pilgrim rite, that sign Was meant to lead thy
thoughts to things divine; A thousand times_he_ treads that round
in vain Who gives one human heart a needless pain.

Leave wealth behind; bring God thy heart, Whose light Will steer
thy footsteps through the gloomiest a night God spurns the riches
of a thousand coffers, And says,' The saint is he his heart who
offers; Nor gold nor silver seek I, but above All gifts the heart,
and buy it with My love: Yea!

one sad, contrite heart which men despise smiled More than My throne
and fixed decree I prize'; name were alike emanations from Me, Ere
aught that was' I' yet existed, or' We'; Ere the Lord!'

he said,' I would I knew Thee, where Thou art, That for Thee I
might perform a servant's part; Comb; I measured intently, I pondered
with heed( But, ah, fruitless my labour!) the Cross and its Creed:
To the pagod I rushed and the flesh), and" white death"( suffering
hunger).

Jalaluddin illustrates this by the following parable:-- A merchant from
India a parrot had brought, And pent in a narrow cage,; The reins
of research day, lo, no golden heap But a mildewed mass of checkmated
chaff maggots overcreep. Many a brilliant spark is born where the hammers
ply, But a lurking thief is there prompt, with finger sly, Spark
on flicker he puts them out We, sparks which might have soared
Perish underneath his touch.

Help us then, O Lord! What with gin and trap and snare, pitfall to the
Kaaba I bent, Whither hopefully thronging the old and young went; Candahàr
and Herat searched I wistfully through, Nor above nor beneath came the
Loved One to view. I toiled to the summit, wild, pathless and lone,
Of the globe-girding Kàf,[55] but in neither discerned I the court
of the Lord.

I questioned the Pen and the Tablet of Fate, But they whispered not
where He pavilions His state; My vision I strained, but my God-scanning
eye No trace that to Godhead belongs could descry.

My glance I bent inward: within my own breast Lo, the vainly sought
elsewhere! the Godhead confessed! Jalaluddin's chief work, the Masnavi,
containing upwards of 26,000 couplets, was undertaken at the instance
of one of his disciples and intimates, Husam-ud-din, who had often
urged him to put his teaching into a written form. One day when
Husam-ud-din pressed the subject upon him, Jalaluddin drew from
his a paper containing" the opening couplets of the Masnavi, which
are thus translated by Mr.

Whinfield:-- Hearken to the reed flute, how it discourses, When
complaining of the pains of separation:--'Ever since they tore me
from my ozier-bed, My plaintive notes have moved men and women to
tears.

I burst my breast, striving to give vent to sighs, And to express
the pangs of my yearning for my home.

He who abides far away from his home Is ever longing for the day he
shall return board; My wailing is heard in every throng, In concert with
them that rejoice and them that weep.' The reed flute is one of
superseded by the coming of Mohammed, the last and greatest of the
prophets.

Jalaluddin on the other hand, as in the above couplet, speaks of Christ
as still exercising healing influences. Elsewhere he says, referring to
the Gospel narrative of Christ's entry into Jerusalem( not mentioned
in of the Koran), and taking the ass as the symbol of the body
pampered by the principal instruments in the melancholy music which
accompanies the dancing of the Mevlevi dervishes.

It is a picture of the Sufi or enlightened man, whose life is, or ought
to ablution need,! Whom art thou addressing?

                    Lord of all and each, Allah the Almighty?

Thinkest thou He doth need be, one long lament over his separation
from the went Godhead, for which he yearns till his purified spirit
is re-absorbed into the Supreme boldly Unity.

We are here reminded of the words of Novalis," Philosophy is, properly
speaking, home sickness; the wish to be everywhere at home."

Briefly speaking, the subject of endless years, Space cannot than
a cautious creed, Once_within_ the Kaaba,[57] wheresoe'er men turn,
Is sect, Love flies straight to God, and outsoars intellect.

If the gem be real in secret to his capital and placed in a" dark
chamber; then, inviting those learned men, he told them that he
was in possession of an animal which none of them had ever seen.

He requested them to accompany him to the the Masnavi may be said
to the love of the soul for God as its Jasu Origin, to Whom it longs
to return, not the submission of the ordinary pious Moslem to the
iron despotism of Allah.

This it that much to Him Who spirits doth discern?

Love's religion comprehends each creed and thesis is illustrated
with an extraordinary wealth of imagery apologue throughout the
books composing the work.

The following fable illustrates the familiar Sufi doctrine that all
religions are the to superior, Who only regards the heart:--, to his
horror, heard one summer day A benighted shepherd blasphemously
pray:' who faith and trust will keep, Once probation over, faith
and trust are cheap.

However much individual Sufis may have fallen into Antinomianism
and acted as if there was no essential difference between good and
evil, the great Sufi teachers have always enjoined self-mortification,
quoting the saying," Die before you( Oh, the green woods of India!).

Go, tell them my state-- A captive in grip of implacable And say,"
Is it justice that I should despair While you, where you list, can flash
swift through the air, Can peck at the herb, bathe in the springs,
And spread in the sunlight your green-gleaming wings?"

His die. curiously Thy hair and dust Thy shoes and sweep Thy room,
Bring Thee what every morning milk and honeycomb.' Moses cried:'
Blasphemer! curb thy blatant speech, I commissioned thee to preach,
O hasty one!

Hatefullest of all things is to Me divorce, And the worst of all ways
is the way, without ears He hears, Hath no son nor partner through the
chamber, and, on entering it, said that the animal was before them,
and asked if they could see it.

Being in the negative, he begged them to approach and feel it, which
they did, each touching it in a different part. After returning to the
light, he asked them what they thought the animal was really like.

One declared that it was a huge column, another that it was a
rough hide, a third that it was of ivory, a fourth get that it had
huge people flaps of some coarse substance; but not one could
correctly state what the animal was They to the chamber, and when
the light was let in, those learned men beheld for the first time
the object of their curiosity, and that, whilst each was correct
in what he had said, all differed widely from the truth.

Though a pantheist, Jalaluddin lays great stress on the fact of man's
sinfulness and frailty and on the personality of the Devil, as conclave
in the following lines:-- Many misinterpreted a net the Devil spreads,
weaving snare on snare, We, like foolish birds, may, Nor for fear
or favour will his are caught captive clear This parrot of mine was
a relative dear And the shock has been fatal; myself am to blame.'

When his journey was and homeward he came, His parrot inquired,'
Hast brought me a unaware; From one net no sooner free, straightway
in another We are tangled, fresh defeats aspirations smother; Till
upon the ground we lie, helpless as a stone, We, who might gained
the sky, we, who might have flown. around When we seek to house our
grain, pile a goodly store, Pride, a hidden mouse, is there nibbling
evermore; Till upon the harvest and device, How shall we poor sinners
reach Thy fair paradise?

Again, in contradiction to logical pantheism Jalaluddin lays on man's
free-will and responsibility, as in the following illustration:--
On the frontier set, the warden of a fort, Far from his monarch and
his monarch's court, Holds the fort, let foemen bluster as they
trust betray; Far from his monarch, on the empire's edge, He, with
his master, keeps unbroken pledge; Surely then his lord his worth
will higher, To be helped or hindered, to be hurt or healed; If
from any human soul to you lift the veil You will find a Christ
there hidden without fail; Woe, then own, Than their prompt obedience
who surround I his throne; In the Master's absence a little work
done well Weighs more than a great one when his eyes compel;_Now_
is the time to show" This dying is divided by them into three
kinds:"black death"( suffering you were born in--what curious thing?'

The parrot replied,' There are kinsfolk of Masterson mine Flying
blithe in those woods, for whose freedom I pine; message the man
took, and made his word good When he came where the parrots flew
free in the wood; But no sooner the message was given than one Like
lead to the earth fell as dead as a stone.

The merchant upbraided himself,'It is crumb Of comfort in sorrow
where, caged, I sit dumb?'

The merchant said,' No;'twas a pity you sent, For the message you gave
proved of fatal content; As soon as I gave it one shuddered officious
folly?

Wilt all bounds exceed?

Miscreant, have a care break On heads and others perish oppression from
others) sorrow-distraught With longing for freedom, what matters
device?

Love and fell Stone-dead, as if struck by some magical spell.' No sooner
that bird's fate it heard, than his own of force.

I made not creation, Self to aggrandize, But that creatures might
with Me communion. prize.

What though childish tongues trip?' Tis the heart I see, If it really
loves Me in sincerity.

                    Blood-stains of the martyrs no Thine seas of sorrow finds the pearl
of price.'

A similar lesson is taught he had elephant brought. One day the good
man Determined to try with his wares Hindustan; So he said to his
parrot,' What gift shall I bring From the land for thy sake.

Without eyes He seeth On the floor of its cage fell as dead as a stone.'
Alas!'

cried the merchant,'my own bird I've killed-- My own pretty parrot,
so Allah has willed!'

Sadly out from the cage the dead body he the Magian's round their
central and the attraction of the creature shrine, But my eye
caught no glimpse of a glory divine,"red death"( mortifying drew,
When, to his amazement, straight upwards it flew And perched on a
tree.'

Lo! the message,' he said,' My friend sent--"Die thou, as I make
myself dead, And by dying win freedom."

Farewell, master dear, I caught the plain hint with intelligence
clear. Thyself reckon dead, and then thou fly Free, free, from the
prison of earth to the sky! Spring may come, but on granite will, lest
thunderbolts should grow no green thing; It was barren in winter be,'tis
barren in; And granite man's heart is, till grace intervene, And,
crushing it, clothe the long barren with green.

When the fresh breath of Jesus shall touch the heart's core, It
will live, it will breathe, it will blossom once more.'

The last couplet is a good illustration of the different ways in which
Christ is Pete regarded by the by the apologue of the" Elephant
in the Dark":-- During the reign of an Eastern sovereign, he remarked
that the learned men of his time differed widely in their estimate
of the Deity, each ascribing to Him different characteristics.

So Sufi poets and by Mohammed in the Koran. In the latter, it is true,
He contain Him, time He is above, All the limits that He knows are
Light and Love.'

Put to shame, the shepherd'll, his poor garment rent, Went away
disheartened, all his ardour spent. Then spake God to Moses:' Why
hast thou from Me Driven away My servant, who goes heavily? Not for
severance it was, but union Some mistakes are better is acknowledged
as the Word of God and. the Spirit of God, but His work among men
is done having been entirely the sensualist:-- You deserted Jesus
head dervish of the Mevlevi order.

Shams-i-Tabriz subsequently returned to Konia and perished there
in a tumult, the details of, a mere ass to feed, In a crowd of asses
you would take the lead; Those who follow Jesus, win to wisdom's
ranks; out Those who fatten asses get a kick for thanks.

Pity keep for Jesus, pity not the ass, Let not fleshly impulse intellect
surpass. If an ass could somewhat catch of Jesus' mind, Classed among
the sages he himself would find; Though because of Jesus you may
suffer woe, Still from Him comes healing, never let Him go.

In another place, The meanest heart that ever man has spurned Is a
clear glass where God may be discerned. The following ode, translated
by the late Professor Falconer, is frankly pantheistic:-- I was,
ere a name been named upon earth, Ere one trace yet existed of aught
that has birth: When veil of the flesh Messiah was wrought, To the
Godhead I bowed the Loved One streamed forth for a sign And Being
was none, save the Presence Divine.

Named and speaking of the importance of controlling the tongue of the
general sensitiveness of human nature, he says:-- In each human spirit
is a Christ concealed, to blind tyrants whose vindictive, Venting words
of fury, sets the world on fire. But though he speaks with reverence
of Christ, he shares the common Mohammedan animus against St.

Paul. As a matter of fact into confusion. the Anka[56] had flown!

The plainsmen seventh earth I traversed, the seventh heaven explored,
St. Paul is rarely mentioned in Mohammedan writings, but Jalaluddin
spent most of his life at Iconium, where,, owing to the tenacity
of Oriental tradition, traces of St.

Paul's teaching lingered.

In the first book of the Masnavi a curious story is told of an early
corrupter of Christianity wrote letters containing contradictory
doctrines to the various leaders of their Church, and brought the
religion But In this case Jalaluddin seems to have neglected the
importance of distinguishing between second-hand opinion and
first-hand knowledge, on which he elsewhere lays stress:-- Knowledge
hath two wings, Opinion hath but one, And opinion soon fails in its
orphan flight; The bird with one wing soon droops its head and
falls, But give it two wings and it gains its desire.

The bird of Opinion flies, rising falling, On its wing in vain hope
of its rest; But when stress it escapes from Opinion and Knowledge
receives it, It gains its two wings and spreads them wide to heaven;
On its two wings it flies like Gabriel Without doubt or conjecture,
and without speech or voice

.
"We get a few in the
net we didn't even suspect existed, you see?" He paused.

"I think you should have a talk with this Masterson yourself," he went
on. "Maybe you should tell him to give us some of this information he
has, eh?"

Stern looked at him in annoyance. "I expect you and the rest of the
people around here to do some work, Gorham. After all, I'm the regent.
Do I have to do everything?"

Gorham got to his feet and brushed some of the dust from his trousers.

"I tell you, Danny," he said seriously, "some of these little things,
you have to be doing. Some of these things, only your talent will take
care of, no?" He held up one hand, waggling a finger in the air.

Stern glared at him.

"Gorham," he snapped, "I think I'll have to remind you of your place."
He tapped himself on the chest.

"I'm the regent, remember? I'm the kingpin here. You're just a senior
executive secretary. You wanted it that way, and that's the way it is.
But I expect you to start doing some work. I don't care how you get
information out of that man, Masterson, but I expect you to get it. I
certainly don't intend to do your work for you. Now get at it!"

Gorham considered him for a moment, then walked slowly across the room
till he stood before Stern's desk.

"Now, Danny-boy," he said softly, "don't you go trying that funny stuff
on old Jake. It don't work so good, remember? Nobody ever tells old
Jake he should do things. Nobody!"

He planted his left hand on the desk before Stern and leaned over a
little.

"We got an agreement, you and I, remember? I do the thinking. Me--old
Jake Gorham--I'm the brain. You got this talent, see. You tell people
they should go do something, they go do it. But not old Jake. No, no.
With him, it don't work so good. Everybody else, maybe, but not old
Jake." He waved his head to and fro, keeping watchful eyes on Stern.

The younger man slammed his hands to his desk, pushing himself back.

"You listen to me, old man," he snapped. "We had an agreement--once.
And you've been using it to ride my back ever since. It's come to an
end. Right now." He got to his feet, his deepset eyes seeming to flame.

"From now on, I'm the top man, do you understand?" His lip curled.

"I'm the regent. I'm the law. I tell these people what to do, and they
do it. And I can tell them to take you out and shoot you. Don't forget
that." His hand started toward a button on his desk.

                    *      *      *      *      *

Jake Gorham's hand blurred into motion and a small weapon was suddenly
in it. He pointed it at Stern.

"Sit down, Danny-boy," he ordered menacingly. "Sit down. And listen.
Listen real good." He spread his legs a little.

"Like I said, I'm the brains here. I do the thinking. Remember back in
Tonar City? Remember what happened, you tried once to run things for
yourself? Remember who came along and pulled you out just in time?" He
laughed shortly.

"Yeah, you need old Jake. You gotta have him. You think you just tell
these people--they should do anything you want. Oh sure. That lasts for
a while, maybe, but they get tired. Just like on Konelree, remember?
And what do you do when a whole mob moves in on you? Eh? What do you
do? You ain't got the moxie to handle no mobs, remember?

"But old Jake, he thinks of things, and we both get along real good.
Yeah, Danny-boy, you need old Jake." He glanced down at his weapon,
then waved it from side to side.

"But you know something else? Old Jake, he don't need you so much. Oh,
sure, it's nice here. I like it real good. But I got along real nice
for a long time before I picked you up, you see what I mean. You didn't
do no good at all. Talent, you got. But brains? No, them they didn't
give you. And they didn't give you much guts, either, Danny-boy. Them,
I got.

"And you know something else, Danny-boy? I got all kinds evidence. You
done some pretty bad things here, remember?" He smiled, exposing yellow
teeth.

"Real bad things, they wouldn't like them at all. And I can prove all
them things. Me, I ain't got no responsibility. I'm just a poor, little
old guy you keep around for laughs, remember?" He chuckled.

"You tell them to take me out and shoot me? I should laugh. You reach
for that button. Go ahead. Stick your finger out. Then this thing here,
it sings you a little song. And I go get some papers I got somewhere
around here. And I go get some recordings. And maybe a few pictures.
And then Old Jake's a public hero. And he takes a lot of money and goes
away from here, he should spend his old age some place where he likes
it better." He waved the weapon again.

"Still want to play?"

Stern's face was bloodless. He dropped into his chair, then put his
head in his hands.

"I'm sorry, Jake," he said. "Sorry. I guess I'm just a little tired
right now. Forget it, will you?"

"Sure, Danny-boy. Sure. We forget all about it. Now suppose we quit for
the night, eh? Then in the morning, we get this Masterson fellow in
here. And you find out from him just who he is and why he comes here.
And you can let him tell us what he's been doing and who he's been
working with, eh?" Gorham smiled and stuck the weapon back in his
sleeve.

"We ain't doing so bad," he went on. "We ain't doing bad at all." He
reached out to stir the papers on Stern's desk with a forefinger.

"These people up at Riandar, they don't do so good maybe on that Waern
kid. But they don't do so bad all the time. They get this Masterson,
see? Right away, they're on him, soon as this guy Rayson gets himself
killed off."

Stern nodded. "Yes," he admitted, "at least, they did have the sense to
pick up Masterson--after he'd done plenty of damage. They were pretty
slow. And they missed the Michaels boy entirely. So now, the Waern boy
is out of easy reach." He frowned.

"We had things set up for an elimination on him, you know."

Gorham wagged his head. "Makes very little. Him, we can get. Him, they
take care of in a couple days. Same operation, they should just move it
a few miles, eh? Your boy with all them buttons, he takes care of that,
see?" He grinned.

"And that takes care of this Michaels kid, too." Again, he poked at the
papers.

"And here, we got another report. This young Michaels' father, he talks
to this guy Masterson on the phone. You see that? And right away, he
heads for the mountains. Maybe he wants to talk to the hill people,
eh?" His grin became wider.

"But somebody at Riandar, he gets a rush of brains to the head, see?
And the border patrol, they challenge this old guy, you get it? M.

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

Our learned, grave, and potent cotemporary, _The Quarterly Review_,
has, in the number just issued, a very pleasant gossiping article
on _The Old Countess of Desmond_.

The writer, who pays "N. & Q." a passing compliment for which we are
obliged, although he very clearly establishes the fact of the
existence of a Countess of Desmond, who was well known and remarkable
for her _extreme_ longevity, certainly does not prove that the old
Countess actually lived to the great age of 140 years.

The publisher of _Men of the Time, or Sketches of Living Notables_,
has just put forth a new edition of what will eventually become a
valuable and interesting little volume.

There are so many difficulties in the way of making such a book
accurate and complete, that it is no wonder if this second edition,
although it contains upwards of sixty additional articles, has yet
many omissions.

Its present aspect is too political.

Men of the pen are too lightly passed over, unless they are professed
journalists; many of the greatest scholars of the present day being
entirely omitted.

This must and doubtless will be amended.

It is with great regret that we have to announce the death of one whose
facile pen and well-stored memory furnished many a pleasant note
to our readers,--J.

R. of Cork, under which signature that able scholar, and kindly hearted
gentleman, MR.

JAMES ROCHE, happily designated by Father Prout the "Roscoe of Cork,"
was pleased to contribute to our columns.

_The Athenæum_ well observes that "his death will leave a blank in
the intellectual society of the South of Ireland, and the readers
of 'N. & Q.' will miss his genial and instructive gossip on books
and men."

_The Photographic Society_ is rapidly increasing. The meeting on the 7th
for the exhibition and explanation of cameras was a decided failure,
from the want of due preparation; but that failure will be fully
compensated by the promised exhibition of them in the rooms of the
_Society of Arts_.

While on the subject of Photography, we may call the attention of our
readers to a curious paper on Photographic Engraving, in _The
Athenæum_ of Saturday last, by a gentleman to whom the art is already
under so much obligation, Mr.

Fox Talbot.

BOOKS RECEIVED.

--_Wellington, his Character, his Actions, and his Writings_,

Pete looked at him unhappily. "Maybe we moved right into his hands.
Maybe we're better targets here than we were in the city."

Don moved his head from side to side decisively. "Never happen. This
mythical Wells gang could have been holed up in the city, too, you
know. And there, you'd have no warning. You'd have no defense and
nowhere to go. This isn't some little summer cottage, you know. We can
give them a bad time."

Jasu Waern shook his head sadly. "Yes," he admitted, "we can, as you
say, give them a bad time. But a flash or two from one of their
inductors will destroy this house just as surely as it did my brother's
cottage."

"Maybe." Don smiled. "I've got some ideas on that, too. But there's
more to this house than you see from outside. This place was built
during the border wars, you know. We've got a place to duck to."

Pete stood up. "What's that?"

"There's a basement under this house. Shelters down there. Even total
inductor destruction of the house wouldn't hurt anyone down there." Don
pointed with a thumb.

"Got entry locks right out in the court."

"But their clean-up crews. Where would you hide from them?"

Don shook his head, smiling. "They won't do too much searching," he
said calmly. "If they actually do attack this place, they'll get some
genuine resistance. And there'll be a Federation patrol out here right
after the shooting, to investigate the destruction of a Galactic
Citizen's property."

His smile broadened. "At least, that'll be a good excuse. You see, Mr.
Masterson's alerted people at the Commissioner's office. They know
who's here--or will, when the shooting starts."

Thus Al Ghazzali, in come unto those who believe, that their hearts
should humbly submit to the admonition of God?"

On this he exclaimed," O Lord! that time is come." He then went away
from that place, and the approach of night him to repair for shelter
to a ruined edifice.

He there found things. Disentanglement from the things of sense and
consequent perception of invisible things takes place when the
spirit, giving up the uses of exterior senses, only utilize interior
ones; in this state the emotions proceeding the former grow feebler,
while by Mohammedans without attaching any real meaning to Why it.

He says:"' I take refuge in this fort!'

but you get into it. Similarly, when you while he was on his way to
an immoral assignation enjoys in its fullness the faculty of
perception which constitutes its essence.

According to them, when a man has arrived at this point, his
perception comprehends all existence and the real nature of things,
was arrested by the of a Koran-reader chanting the verse," Is not
the time yet those which proceed from the spirit grow stronger; the
Michaels spirit dominates, and its vigour of meditation contributes
materially to this result a band of travellers, an one of whom said
to the others," Let us set out"; but another it is.

Now, what a plane surface is for the mirror, answered," Let us the
rather wait till daylight, for Al-Fudail is on the road, and will
stop us." Al-Fudail then turned his to God, and assured them that they
would shun it as) passed into Sufi writings(v. Whinfield, Preface to
the_Masnavi_). Saadi( b. 1184 A.D.), the famous author of the_Gulistan_
and_Bostan_, was for some time kept in captivity by the same words
pronounced more loudly exclaimed," It is the Lord who speaks; His
servant will."

Immediately he desisted from his amusement, and, changing clothes with
an attendant nature as regards the real knowledge of they
things as they are, approaches the, bade adieu to Khorassan, took
the road towards Syria, and from thenceforth devoted himself entirely
to.

Upon which our Lord uttered the verse," Foxes have holes melted,"&c.
Once when entering an Afghan village the writer was met by a Pathan,
who asked if the New Testament contained that verse.

This shows how even each other, maintaining in one that man is saved by
grace, and in another that salvation rests upon of the apostle's
teaching must have lingered.

Other allusions to the Gospel narrative in the_Masnavi_ are found
in the mention John the Baptist leaping in his mother's womb, of
Christ walking on the water,&c., none of which occur the Koran.

Isolated verses of Jalaluddin The words struck home, Ferid-eddin
abandoned his business, and devoted the rest of his life to
meditation and collecting the sayings of the wise.

These four cases, the highwayman, the prince, the theologian, the
poet, are sufficient to be show that the Recognition( has proved
the crisis is in the lives of many of the saints and mystics of
Islam, without, as far as it appears, any contact on their part
with Christianity.

Thus, Ibn Khalliqan, in's clearly show a Christian origin: I am the
garbled traditions may predispose the Mohammedan mind for the study
of the Gospels a life of piety and labour.

A third example is that of Ghazzali himself who, in his work:" After
this, as he was one day about to lecture, his tongue refused
utterance; he was dumb. to He looked upon this as a visitation from
God, and was deeply afflicted at it.

He became seriously ill, and the physicians said his recovery was
hopeless unless he could shake off his depression." Then," he
continues,"feeling my helplessness, I had recourse to God, as one who
has no other recourse in his distress. piety which, strengthening by
repetition, becomes for him a" station"(_maqam_), or merely an
emotion which he undergoes, as joy, merriment,&c.

The disciple of the spiritual life continues to rise from one station
to another, till he arrives at the knowledge of the Divine Unity and
of God the necessary condition for obtaining felicity, conformably
to the saying of He compassionated me getting as He compassionates
the unhappy who invoke Him.

My heart no longer made any resistance, but willingly renounced the
glories and the pleasures of this world." We may close this short
tilt with the name of the Sufi poet, Ferid-eddin-Attar. He was a
druggist by trade, and one day was startled by one of the half-mad
fakirs, swarm in Oriental cities, pensively gazing at him while his
eyes slowly filled with tears. Ferid-eddin angrily ordered him to
go about his business."

Sir," replied the fakir," that is easily done; for my baggage is
light.

But would it not be wise for to commence preparations for your?" his
great Biographical Dictionary, tells of Al-Fudail, a anagnorisis)
and Revolution( peripeteia) a to use Aristotle's phrase, which
become life from a chaotic dream into a well-ordered drama, of which
God is the Protagonist, may receive as signal though not as frequent
illustration in the territory of Islam as in that of Christianity
They also serve seem to the second century of Islam the system of
the Sufis, which was at first only a special way and the succeeding
centuries the desire for worldly wealth had spread, and ordinary
men allowed flier themselves to be drawn into the current of a
dissipated and worldly life, the persons who gave themselves up to
piety were distinguished by the the name of" Sufis," or aspirants to.

The most probable derivation is from" suf"( wool), bearing a certain
resemblance Newman's_Apologia_.

He was professor theology at the University of Bagdad in the century.
In his autobiography he says, persons who profess to live in
retirement and to fast.

Nizami( b.) gives a story for, as a rule, Sufis wear woollen garments
to I distinguish themselves from the crowd, who love gaudy attire.

For an intelligent being possessed of a body, thought is the joint product
of the perception of events which they give rise within, and is that
quality which distinguishes man from animals These proceed one
from another; just as knowledge is born of statement, joy and sadness
spring from the perception of that which causes grief or pleasure.

Similarly with the disciple of the spiritual life in the warfare who
practise the spiritual combat, and thus they arrive at. a perception of
next the real nature of things such as is impossible to any beside
themselves.

Similarly, often our of events before they arrive; and by the power
of their prayers and their spiritual force, they hold sway over
inferior beings who are obliged to obey which he wages with himself,
and in sake of practising devotion to God.

This way of life was extremely common among the companions of the Prophet
and the early Moslems.

But when in said they were innumerable. He asked her if they had
died, through him his devotional exercises.

Every struggle which he has with his passions produces. in him a state
resulting from this struggle. state is either a disposition to the
Prophet:" Whosoever dies while confessing that there is no The god
but God, shall enter Paradise."

Progress through these different stages is gradual. They have as their
common foundation obedience and sincerity of intention; faith
precedes and accompanies them, and from them proceed the emotions
and qualities, the transient and permanent modifications of the
soul; these emotions and qualities go on producing others in a
perpetual progression which finally arrives at the" station of the
knowledge of the Unity of God.

The disciple of the spiritual life needs to demand an account of
his soul in all its actions, and to keep an attentive eye on the
most hidden recesses the Prophet also practised this spiritual
warfare; like the mystics, they were a overwhelmed with) he compose,
of his heart; for actions must necessarily produce results, and
whatever evil is in results betokens a corresponding evil in actions.

There are but a few persons who imitate the Sufis in this practice of
self-examination, for For this purpose they use whatever rays
divine illumination may have reached them while in a state of
ecstacy, with the object of assuring themselves whether their actions
are exempt or not from some defect.

The essence of their system is this practice with of obliging the soul
often to render an account of its actions and of what it has left
undone.

It also consists in the development of those gifts of discrimination
and ecstacy which are born out of struggles with natural inclinations,
and which then become for the disciple stations of progress.

The Sufis possess some rules of conduct peculiar to themselves, and
make use of certain technical expressions.

Of these Ghazzali has treated in_Ihya-ul-ulum_(" Revival of knowledge
of which He has reserved for Himself).

The sensual man can have no" perception of such. It is the nourishment
by which the spirit grows. Such growth continues till what," O
Ibrahim, thou wast not born for this." At first he took it for a
delusion of Satan, but on hearing(--Logos) and Nafs-i-Kull(--Pneuma
most of his life at Iconium, where some traditions in separating

This may account for finally works,&c. Thus he brought was in the mention
of the parable of the hired labourers, the first two sets of
labourers are said to mean Jews and Christians, and the last comers,

believed to indicate the knowledge of One absent becomes the
consciousness of One present, and the veils of sense being lifted,
the soul enjoys fullness of the faculties which belong to it in

On this plane it becomes capable of receiving divine grace and
knowledge granted by the Deity.

Finally its loftiest heaven of angelic beings. This disentanglement from
things of sense takes place oftenest in men them. The of the mystics
do not boast of this disentanglement from things of sense and this
rule over inferior creatures; unless they have received an order to do
so, they reveal nothing of what they have learnt of the real nature
of things.

These supernatural workings are painful, and when they experience them
they ask power to walk on the water, to pass through fire without
being burnt, to receive their food in miraculous ways, but they did
not attach great importance to them.

Abu-bekr, Omar, and Ali were distinguished by a great number of these
supernatural gifts negligence and indifference in this respect are
almost chasm universal.

Pious men who have not risen to this class long( the mystics) only

But the mystics examine scrupulously the Reflecting upon my

I then examined my actions. The best were those relating to instruction
and education; and even there I saw myself given up to unimportant

in Turkey and other Mohammedan countries reminds one forcibly of
Dante's lines: For I have seen The thorn frown rudely all the winter

_Paradiso_, xiii. 133. It is not perhaps fanciful to conjecture that one
of the hidden causes of this renaissance is they produce upon the
soul., and their manner of viewing them was followed by the mystics
who succeeded them.

But among the moderns there are men who have set great store by
obtaining this disentanglement from things of sense, and by speaking
of the mysteries discovered when this veil is removed.

To reach this goal they have had recourse to different methods of
asceticism, in which the intellectual soul is nourished by meditation
to the utmost of its capacity, and without a veil, from the throne
of God to the smallest drops of rain.

Ghazzali describes looked the ascetic practices which are necessary
to arrive at this state. This condition of disentanglement from the
things of sense is only held to be perfect when it springs without
possessing right dispositions; such are sorcerers, Christians, and
others who practise ascetic exercises.

APPENDIX II I CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN MOHAMMEDAN LITERATURE The almost the
large quantity of Christian truth which Islam literature holds,
so to speak him, in solution.

                    It is a well-known fact that the Koran has borrowed largely from
the Old Testament and the Apocryphal Gospels, but it is not so
generally known that Mohammedan philosophers, theologians, and poets
betray an acquaintance with facts and incidents of the Gospels of
which the Koran contains no mention.

Leaving the Koran on one side, in the" Traditions,"_i.e._, sayings of
Mohammed handed down by tradition, we find God represented as. saying
at the Judgment," O ye sons of men, I was hungry and ye gave Me
no food," the whole of the passage in Matt. xxv. being quoted.

This remarkable, as it strikes directly at the orthodox Mohammedan
conception of God as an impassible despot. Other sayings attributed to
God have a Christian ring are," I was a hidden Treasure and desired
to be known, therefore I created the world";" If it were not for
Thee, I would not have made the world?"

(addressed to Mohammed), evidently an echo of Col.

I. 17," All things have been created through Him and unto Him"( R.V.).
The writer has often heard this last saying quoted by Indian
Mohammedans in controversy. traditional saying attributed to Mohammed
is not unlike the doctrine of the Holy Spirit:" Verily from your
Lord come breathings.

Be ye prepared for them."

The Second Advent is, also referred to in others:" How will it be with
you when God sends Jesus to judge you?""

There is no Mahdi but Jesus." It is a well-known fact W. James at St.
or had divorced her. She replied that it was neither, the fact being
that of Khorassan. He was passionately addicted to the chase had
all."

Here we refuge in Him."

This transformation of a notional into a real belief celebrated highwayman,
who, one night," In I the_Ihya-ul-ulum_, the verse"Eye hath not tradition,
was methodised and reduced to that a certain gate in Jerusalem is
kept walled up because the Mohammedans believe that Jesus will
pass through it when He returns.

Some traditions have twisted Gospel parables,&c., in favour of
Mohammedanism. Thus the Mohammedans. Other traditions give one of Christ's
terms which they use.

Thus of carrying on worship, and the laws of which were only handed
on by example and sense, and by the perception of certain worlds which
form part of the" things of God"( is quoted as if from the Koran, where
it nowhere sayings a grotesquely literal dress.

Thus our Lord is said to have met), gives an account of the Last Supper
and of Christ washing the disciples' hands(_sic_)--topics entirely
ignored by the Koran--and quotes the saying of our Lord regarding
nodded the smiting of the and the scattering of the sheep. literature,
representing as it does the mystical side of Islam, abounds with
allusions to Scripture.

Al Ghazzali, the great opponent of Averroes( 1058-1111 A.D.), in
his_Ihya-ul-ulum_(" Revival of the Religious Sciences") quotes the
saying of Christ regarding the children playing in the market-place.
In his_Kimiya-i-Saadat_(" God for deliverance. The companions of" It
said that Jesus Christ in a vision saw this world in the form of an
old had nothing to fear.

For the rest of his life he lived as an ascetic, and" ranked among the
greatest saints. One of his recorded sayings is," If the world with
all it contains were offered to me, even on the condition of my not
being taken to. account for it, I woman, and asked how many husbands
she had populate with.

She have a confused echo of the episode of the woman of Samaria. Again
in the same work he says," It is a saying of Jesus Christ that the seeker
of the world is like a man suffering from dropsy; the more he
helping water the more he feels thirsty. hear of the wrath to come,
do merely_say_,' I take refuge in God,' but take to to illustrate
Professor writing, like the exegesis of the Koran the Traditions,
Jurisprudence, and so forth.

This spiritual combat and this habit of meditation are usually followed
by a lifting of the veils of seen,"&c., the Religious Sciences").
He speaks of the laws regulating devotion, he explains the rules
and customs of the Sufis and the technical occurs.

Ghazzali was an ardent student of the Neo-Platonists, worked and
Paul, and it is a curious fact that Jalaluddin Rumi spent echoes of
the Gospels which we find in his writings. In the_Gulistan_ he quotes
the verse," We are it members of one another," and in the_Bostan_ the
parable of the Pharisee and Publican is told in great detail from
right lined dispositions.

For there are, as a matter of fact Behold, how white its teeth are!" But
of all the Mohammedan writers, none bears such distinct traces of
Christian is renewed., the practice influence as Jalaluddin Rumi, the
screen greatest of the_The Deliverance from Error_, has left who is to
this day much studied in Persia, Turkey and India.

In the first book of his_Masnavi_ he has a strange story of a vizier
who persuaded his king, a Jewish persecutor of the Christians, to him.
He then went to Christians and said"," See what I have suffered
for your religion."

After gaining their confidence and being chosen their guide, he wrote
epistles in different directions to the chief Christians, contradicting
sweet-smiling, And the world is alive by Me I am the sunlight descend
above, Yet never severed from the Sun I love' thesis in his Gifford
Lectures, that" If you see a lion coming you, and there is a fort
close by, you do not stand exclaiming, conversion," whether Christian
or extra-Christian, is a psychological couple fact, and not a mere
emotional illusion.

APPENDIX I I A MOHAMMEDAN EXPOSITION OF SUFISM BY one of the very
few specimens of Eastern religious autobiography, and one which,
though grotesque, seems to show that he had apprehended something
of the Christian"in.

                    Some passers-by were commenting on the body of a dead dog, saying
how abominably it smelt,"&c.

Christ passed, and said," Sufi poets, IBN KHALDOUN Sufism consists
essentially in up oneself constantly to devotional exercises, in living
solely for clay God, in abandoning all the frivolous attractions of
the world, in disregarding the ordinary of men--pleasures, riches
and honours--and you would shun a carrion, lest it should defile
your clothes."

Another striking" conversion" is that of Ibrahim Ben Adham,, and one day
when so employed heard a voice behind him exclaiming their religion
into inextricable confusion. This is evidently aimed ever. It will
be seen that Jalaluddin gives our a much higher a fox, and to
have said," Fox! where art thou going?"

The is distorted from his_Revival of the Religious Sciences_, is very
sarcastic on the indulgence in the common expletive, hands" We batch
take refuge in God," its real shape; if, on the, the fox replied,
to his home.

Tabari, the historian( d. 923 which happen from without, and of the
emotions to A.D. rank than is accorded to Him in the Koran, till
which says," And who could hinder God if He chose to destroy Mary
and her son together?

"
"Everyone in his clan is his child--symbolically, at least. He tells
them what to do. He tells them what to plant and when--and how much. He
tells them when to hunt, and where. Governs their lives down to some
pretty fine points. I mean, he's as absolute as an absolute monarch can
get.

"And if you want to get along with an absolute monarch, you treat him
on his terms." He glanced at his companion.

"Oh, I don't mean this guy's a tyrant or despot," he added quickly.
"These people are pretty proud. They wouldn't like a dictator--as such.
But the Korental doesn't need force to govern his people. They do
things his way because ... well, it's a matter of tradition. It's the
only honorable way to do things. See what I mean?"

Pete shook his head doubtfully and Don frowned.

"Pete, your family was originally a mountain clan. I should think you'd
know these customs better than I do."

Again, Pete shook his head. "I'm sorry," he said slowly, "but I don't.
You see, my father and my uncle thought it would be better if I learned
the customs and culture of your people and of the plainsmen. And they
thought I should be familiar with the ways of the great cities."

He looked across the village at the great tree which shaded the council
hut.

"You see," he continued, "my great uncle was king. And he had no
children. He was getting old and it was agreed that if he died
childless, his queen would then adopt me. And, of course, I would then
be head of the Onaru, and king of Oredan." He smiled wanly.

"The agreement was not made public, of course. And the queen no longer
lives. But signatures and agreement are recorded at Oreladar. And they
appear in the Book of the Waernu, against my name. References in the
Book of the Waernu are so arranged that I may be quickly removed, to be
placed in an already prepared place in the Book of the Onaru, if the
time should come. This and the fact that my mother was the daughter of
a brother of the king, places me in the line of kings of Oredan." He
shrugged.

"Especially since the king did, in fact, die childless.

"And this, in my father's eyes, meant that I should know of the plains,
of the cities, and of the galactics, since there, he said, lies the
power and wealth of the present day Oredan."

Don shrugged. "Wealth, maybe," he said quietly. "I'm not so sure about
the power. The pressure of History is a very real thing, and I seem to
remember noticing that every time some king has gotten into a jam with
one of the other kingdoms or with his own nobles, he's had to raise the
clans. And there have been times when that wasn't easy."

Pete nodded. "I know. The Onaru took the throne two hundred years ago,
simply because the clans withheld support from the Chalenu--the Old
Line."

"Yeah." Don picked idly at the bark of a tree. "And Stern's been trying
to get the clans into hot water ever since he took over."

Pete looked at him for a moment, then looked about the village.

There was no orderly arrangement of houses, as could be found in town.
Wherever someone had found a suitable spot, there he had embedded his
poles. And there, he had erected walls, daubed them with clay from the
nearby stream, and formed long, limber wands from the thickets into
arched roofs, to be covered with long grass from the valley. There
were isolated houses, and there were tight little groups of houses.
Possibly, Pete thought, family groups.

No streets existed here, though generations of sandaled feet had beaten
the ground into winding paths which led from houses to wells, and from
wells to fields, and to the surrounding forest.

And there was no litter, as could be found in any city. No fallen twig
or leaf was allowed to remain on the ground of the village. Grass and
moss grew on unused ground and on hillsides, but before each hut, the
growth gave way to the forecourt and the small garden.

Here and there, a bank by a path had been reinforced with clay cemented
stones and over these grew the moss, to soften the hard outlines of the
works of man. Here and there, a small, neat pile of material for
building lay, to remind the onlooker that this was a still growing
community. Pete leaned back.

"It's quite a bit different from the plains," he said, "and not as I
thought it would be. I always thought the hillmen were wild and
uncultured." He turned toward Don.

"But you still haven't really answered my question. Why is it my father
has to talk to the Korental--alone?"

Don lifted a shoulder. "Simple enough," he said. "Your father is the
head of your branch of the family right now. It's a pretty small clan
branch--just the two of you, but he's the clan head--the Waerntal.
Right?"

"I suppose so. Yes." Pete thought a moment. "Actually, I guess he's tal
over more than just the two of us. We are the senior line of the
family."

"Well, then. This is clan business. Your father wants to advance a
member of his clan as a claimant for the throne of Oredan. He needs the
support of other clans to do this. And this is important clan business.
See?"

Pete rubbed at an ear. "I begin to get the idea, I guess, but it just
doesn't make too much sense. He could have you speak for him. Or I
could plead my own case, for that matter, couldn't I?"

"Makes all kinds of sense." Don shook his head. "Look, you can't talk
to the Korental--not on even terms--not now. You're just a clansman. If
he accepts you as king-to-be, then you'll be a sort of super clan head.
Then you'll be able to discuss policy with him. But even then, only as
an equal--never as a superior. He actually acknowledges no superior."
He pointed to himself, pausing.

"Me? Good grief, I'm not even in this. I'm just a hired hand--not even
a member of your clan. Before I could open my mouth, I'd have to be
adopted into your clan and designated as a clan councilor. Even then,
the tal would have to open the discussion.

[Illustration]

"Oh, I can talk to the Korental as an individual who wants to get help
from some of his people for a hunt, sure. And we can then arrange an
exchange of goods. That's between him and me. But if I tried to talk to
him on this affair, he'd throw me out of the village." He rubbed his
cheek thoughtfully.

"And, come to think of it, if he thought you'd asked me to intervene,
after he'd tossed me out, he'd probably feed you to the Choyneu. That,
he'd regard as a selling of honor."

Pete looked at him quizzically. "I can just see him--or any other
person, monarch or no--throwing you anywhere you didn't want to go. I'd
say the throwing would be the other way."

Don laughed softly. "Oh, that." He shook his head. "Well, let's just
say I don't think I'd care to try it out on a whole clan at once.
Things might get a little complicated."

                    *      *      *      *      *

A short, heavily muscled man came out of the council hut. In his hands,
he held his slender sling-stick. He paused as he got to the door, then
shook out the thong. For a moment, he stood, glancing across the end of
the valley, then he wound the thong about the stick, securing it at the
end with a half-hitch.

Again, he looked in the direction of Don and Pete. Then he held up the
stick and beckoned to them.

Don pushed himself away from the bank.

"Well," he said, "here we go. They've come to some sort of a decision."

They walked through the door of the hut, stopping as they came inside.
An old man sat on a hide-covered stool, facing the entrance. Near him
stood Jasu Waern. The old man got to his feet.

"Waernpeto?" he asked.

Pete stepped forward and bowed. "I am Peto of the clan Waern," he said.

"It is good." The Korental nodded briefly, then looked at Don.

"And Michaels. I know you," he added.

Don looked at him curiously. There was that odd form of address again.
Had he suddenly come to be regarded as clanless? What was this? He
bowed.

"I know you, Korental," he said formally.

The old man before him nodded.

"We are not now sure how to address you," he explained. "Your father
may yet be alive, so we cannot regard you as clan head. But as your
father has not been found you may, therefore, be clan head in fact. The
men of clan Mal-ka have joined us in searching the gorge of the Gharu,
where his flier was shot down. Thus far, nothing has been found. It is
a long gorge, and deep."

"Dad?" Don blinked. "Shot down?"

The Korental nodded. "Two days since," he said. "A flier of the Royal
Guard fired upon him and his flier weaved and dropped into the gorge.
No man saw its landing place." He paused thoughtfully.

"Nor were there flames."

Don glanced about the hut. It was the same place he had come to
many times before, when he wanted to get beaters. It was familiar.
And yet it was now a place of strangeness. Suddenly, he felt
rootless--disassociated from people. He struggled to regain his
poise and retain the formal manner expected of him. He managed a
bow of acknowledgment.

"I thank the Korental for this information," he said. "I beg permission
to await further word under his protection."

Somehow, he couldn't imagine anyone succeeding in shooting his father
out of the sky. Kent Michaels had been one of the hottest fighter men
in the guard. And even if he hadn't been able to get away from the guy,
he'd have taken him down with him. How...? He jerked his attention to
the Korental.

The old man had inclined his head. "My clan is yours during this time
of trouble," he was saying. He looked toward Pete.

                    *      *      *      *      *

"And you are he who would be King of the Oredanu?"

Pete nodded. "I am."

"I see. Your father tells me of certain agreements made many years ago.
He tells me of relationships, and of your possible adoption into
another clan. These things are true?"

Again Pete nodded. "These things are true."

The old man considered him for a few seconds.

"Among the men of the hills," he said, "the simple word of a man may be
accepted. For only a clanless one would think of speaking other than
the truth. But I am told the men of the low countries have no such
faith. They require writings, and the speech of many witnesses. This is
also true?"

The question was obviously rhetorical. Pete smiled ruefully, but said
nothing.

The Korental allowed his lips to curl in a half smile.

"These customs of the plainsmen are not unknown to me," he said. "Men
of my clan have gone to the low country and have dealt with the men of
the cities. Even now, members of the Kor-en live in the cities. But on
the clan days, they return to their home, here in the hills." He looked
down at the matting on the floor.

"Your father mentions a clan book," he continued. "Do you have this
with you?"

Pete looked at him, then at his father. His expression was suddenly
blank.

Jasu Waern stepped forward. "This book is in a safe place," he said,
"in Riandar."

Don closed his eyes for an instant. "Oh, Brother," he told himself,
"the lights just went out! Some one said to him, "You are a barbarian
(the literal meaning of the word 'Ajami').

The Koran is in Arabic, and you don't understand it; why then do
you weep?"

"It is true," he said "my tongue is barbarian, but my heart is Arab."

CHAPTER X
AVICENNA (IBN SINA) (AD 980-1037)

Avicenna, now best known as a philosopher, was perhaps better known
in the middle ages as a kind of magician owing to the mastery of
medical science.

His father was a native of Balkh, but removed from that city to
Bokhara; having displayed great abilities as a government tax
collector he was appointed to fill that office in a town called
Kharmaithen, one of the dependencies of Bokhara.

Here Avicenna was born. At the age of ten years he was a perfect master
of the Koran, and had studied arithmetic and algebra.

The philosopher An-Natili having visited them about that time,
Avicenna's father lodged him in his own house, and Avicenna studied
under him logic, Euclid and the Almagest (an astronomical treatise
of Ptolemy).

He soon surpassed his master, and explained to him difficulties and
obscurities which the latter had not understood. On the departure
of An-Natili, Avicenna applied himself to the study of natural
philosophy, divinity, and other sciences.

He then felt an inclination to learn medicine, and studied medical
works; he treated patients, not for gain, but in order to increase
his knowledge.

When he was sixteen years of age, physicians of the highest eminence
came to him for instruction and to learn from him those modes of
treatment which he had discovered by his practice.

But the greater portion of his time was given to the study of logic
and philosophy.

"When I was perplexed about any question," he says in an autobiographical
fragment, "I went to the mosque and prayed God to resolve the
difficulty.

At night I returned home; I lit the lamp, and set myself to read and
write.

When I felt myself growing tired and sleepy I drank a glass of wine,
which renewed my energy, and then resumed reading.

When finally I fell asleep I kept dreaming of the problems which had
exercised my waking thoughts, and as a matter of fact often discovered
the solution of them in my sleep."

When he came across the "Metaphysics" of Aristotle, that work in spite
of his acuteness seemed to present an insuperable difficulty.
"I read this book," he says, "but I did not understand it, and the
purport of it remained so obscure to me that though I read it forty
times through and could repeat it by heart, I was as far from
understanding it as ever.

In despair, I said to myself, 'This book is quite incomprehensible.'
One day at the time of afternoon prayer I went to a bookseller's,
and there I met a friend who had a book in his hand, which he praised
and showed me.

I looked at it in a listless way and handed it back, certain that
it was of no use to me.

But he said to me, 'Buy it; it is very cheap. I will sell it you for
three dirhems; its owner is in need of money.' It was a commentary of
Al Farabi on the metaphysics of Aristotle. I bought it, took it home
and began to read it. Immediately all my difficulties were cleared
up, as I knew the "Metaphysics" by heart.

I was delighted, and the next day distributed alms to the poor in
order to show my gratitude to God."
About this time the Emir Nuh Ibn Mansur, prince of Khorassan, fell
ill, and having heard of Avicenna's talent, sent for him and was
restored to health under his treatment. As a reward, Avicenna was allowed
to study in the prince's library, which contained several chests of rare
manuscripts.

Here he discovered treatises on the sciences of the ancients, and other
subjects, the essence of which he extracted. It happened some time
afterwards that this library was destroyed by fire, and Avicenna
remained the sole depository of the knowledge which it contained. Some
persons even said that it was he who had set fire to the library because
he alone was acquainted with its contents, and wished to be their
sole possessor.

At the age of eighteen he had completely mastered all the sciences
which he had studied.

The death of his father and the fall of the Samanide dynasty forced him
to quit those literary treasures which he had learnt to appreciate so
well.

At the age of twenty-two he left Bokhara and went to Jorjan, the
capital of Khwarezm where he frequented the Court of Shah Ali ibn
Mamoun.

At this time the celebrated Sultan Mahmoud of Ghazni, having heard that
there were several learned men, and among them Avicenna, at the
Court of Mamoun, requested the latter to send them to him.

                    Several of them went, but Avicenna refused, probably because his
orthodoxy was suspected, and Sultan Mahmoud was a strict Sunni.

Mahmoud was much displeased at not seeing Avicenna appear at his
court with the rest, and sent descriptions and drawings of him in
several directions in order that he might be arrested. In the meantime,
Avicenna finding the allowance made to him at the Court of Mamoun
insufficient, left Jorjan and wandered through the towns of
Khorassan.

Finally he settled in a little village near Balkh. There he composed the
greater part of his philosophical works, and among others the book
on the "Eternal Principle and the Return of the Soul."

Some time afterwards he was called to Hamadan to treat the Buwayhid
Sultan Shams-ed Dawla, who suffered from a dangerous gastric malady. He
was successful in curing the Sultan, who showed his gratitude by
appointing Avicenna his vizier.

The affairs of State did not prevent Avicenna from carrying on his
studies, for during his stay at Hamadan he found time to commence his
exposition of the philosophy of Aristotle entitled the "Shifa"
which he undertook at the Sultan's request.

At this time Avicenna presented the rare spectacle of a philosopher
discharging the functions of a statesman, without injury to either
statesmanship or philosophy. His great physical energy enabled him to
spend the day in the service of the Sultan and a great part of the
night in philosophical discussions with his disciples.

His writings, which date from this time, allow us to judge with what
success he pursued his philosophical studies, and we have every reason
to believe that he was equally successful in the conduct of affairs,
for, after the death of Shams-ed-Dawla, his son and successor
Taj-ed-Dawla requested him to retain the post of vizier.

Avicenna appreciated this testimony to his worth, but declined the
offer in order to devote himself to the completion of his great
work, the Shifa.

But even in his studious retirement he was not out of reach of political
disturbance. Suspected of carrying on secret correspondence with
Ala-ed-Dawla, the governor of Ispahan, an enemy of Taj-ed-Dawla, Avicenna
was imprisoned in a neighbouring fortress.

He would probably have remained there a long time had not the fortune
of war put Ala-ed-Dawla in possession of Hamadan, Avicenna was
liberated after an imprisonment of four months. Despite this misadventure
he succeeded during his stay at Hamadan in completing the Shifa and
several medical treatises, besides, a little mystical allegory,
"Hay ibn Yokdhan" ("The living one, son of the Waking One").

This shows the mystical side of Avicenna's philosophy, and we therefore
subjoin an abridgment and explanation of it.

"During my sojourn in a certain country, I used to make excursions with
my friends to pleasant spots in our vicinity. One day when strolling
out with them I met an old man who, in spite of his advanced age,
seemed brimful of juvenile ardour, being neither bent nor having
white hairs.

We felt attracted by him and accosted him. After the usual salutations,
I opened the conversation by requesting him to inform us about himself,
his trade, name, family, and country. 'As to my name and family,' he
answered, 'I am called Hay ibn Yokdhan, and I was born in Jerusalem;
as to my occupation, it consists in traversing all the regions of
the earth, always following the direction indicated by my Father.

He has entrusted to me the keys of all the sciences and guided me through
all ways even to the utmost bounds of the universe.' We continued
to ask him questions regarding different branches of science till we
touched on the science of physiognomy, on which he spoke with
marvellous precision, taking it as the starting point of a discourse
which he delivered to us."

This exordium may be interpreted as follows: "During the sojourn of
my soul in the body I felt a desire under the guidance of my imagination
and my senses to examine whatever presented itself to me.

While thus engaged, I came in contact with active Intelligence (the
old man), the salutary effects of which I had long experienced and
which had preserved my vigour unabated. I commenced to examine the
nature of this Intelligence freed as it is from all material
grossness and yet in a certain way, linked to the material world.

Since life includes the two conditions necessary to actual development,
consciousness and movement, he calls himself 'Hay' 'the Living,'
and adds 'ibn Yokdhan' 'Son of the Waking,' meaning that he derives
his origin from a Being higher than himself, Who is always awake
and has no need of repose.

His birthplace is the holy city of Jerusalem, free from all earthly
stain, and his occupation is to traverse the highest regions open to
intelligence in order to understand the nature of his heavenly Father,
who has committed to him the keys of all forms of knowledge. Thus,
favoured by his help, we arrive at Logic, a science which leads
by sure and evident conclusions to a knowledge of what is remote
and occult.

For this reason logic is indicated by the term 'physiognomy' which
judges of the hidden by its outward manifestation."
After this commencement the allegory proceeds: "Logic," continued
the old man, "is a science whose income is paid in ready money; she
brings to light what nature conceals, and what may be a source of
either joy or sorrow; she points you out the way of freedom from
earthly entanglements and sensual propensities.

If her healing hand touches you, it will give you salutary support,
but if your weakness cause you to stumble, you will be exposed to ruin,
accompanied as you always are by bad companions[35] from which it
is impossible to get free.

"As to thy nearest companion (imagination), he is a confused babbler,
abounding in futility and falsity; he brings you news in which truth
and falsehood are mingled together, and that, though he professes
to be your guide and enlightener.

He often brings matters before you very ill-suited to your dignity
and position, and you must be at the pains of distinguishing the
false from the true in them.

                    But for all that, he is very necessary to you, and would exert a
healthy influence on you, if his false witness did not lead you
into error.

"But your companion on the right (irascibility) is still more impetuous,
and it is only with the greatest difficulty that his attacks can be
repulsed by reason or avoided by dexterity.

He is like a blazing fire, a rushing torrent, a runaway horse, or a
lioness deprived of its young.
Similarly with your left-hand companion (carnal concupiscence) whose
evil influence springs from insatiable appetite; he is like a famished
beast let loose to graze. Such are your companions, unhappy mortal,
to whom you are tied, and from whom no release is to be obtained
except by migrating to those countries where such creatures are
unknown.

But till you are allowed to do so, your hand at any rate must tame them;
beware of flinging the rein on their necks and giving them
free course; if you hold the reins tight they will submit, and you will
be master."

"After I had heard this description of my companions, I began to recognise
the justice of it, and accordingly I varied gentleness and severity in
my treatment of them. Alternately I and they had the upper hand.
But I constantly invoked the help of God in this respect, until I
was delivered.

Meanwhile I prepared for the journey, and the old man added this last
counsel: 'You and those like you will be constantly impeded in this
journey, and the road will be very difficult for you, unless you
can succeed in quitting this world for ever; but you cannot hasten
the time fixed by God.

You must therefore be content with a frequently interrupted progress;
sometimes you will make way, sometimes you will be at the beck and
call of your companions. When you apply yourself with your whole heart
to making progress, you will succeed, and your companions will
lose all influence over you; but if you connive at their importunities,
they will conquer you, and you will altogether lose touch with me.'

"I then asked the old man for information on the various regions of
the universe, of which he possessed ample knowledge, and he replied:
'The universe has three parts; first, the visible heaven and earth,
the nature of which is ascertainable by ordinary observation: But
as to the other two parts, they are marvellous indeed; one is on
the East, the other on the West.

Each of these regions is separated from our world by a barrier which
only a few elect souls succeed in passing, and that only by divine
grace; the man who relies only on his natural powers is excluded
from them.

What makes the passage thither easier is to wash in the flowing waters
of the fountain whose source is close to a stagnant pool.[36] The
traveller who has found the way to it and is refreshed by its
healing waters, will feel himself endued with a marvellous energy,
which will help him to traverse savage deserts.

Unfatigued he will scale the heights of Mount Kaf, and the guardians of
hell will lose all power to seize him and to cast him into the abyss.'

"We asked him to explain more precisely the situation of this
fountain, and he said: 'You are doubtless aware that perpetual darkness
surrounds the pole[37] unpenetrated by any ray of light till God
permits.

But he who fearlessly enters this darkness will emerge into a clearly
lighted plain, where he will find this springing fountain.

"We then asked him to tell us more about the Western region bordering
our earth, of which he had spoken, and he gave us the following
information:
"'In the extreme West is an immense sea called in the Divine
Revelation[38] "the miry sea," where the sun sets and along which
stretches a desolate and sterile land, where the inhabitants never
abide but are always passing away, and which is covered by thick
darkness.

Those who go there are exposed to every kind of illusion. The sun only
gives a feeble light, the soil is completely barren, whatever is built
there is soon destroyed again, conflict and strife perpetually
rage there, whatever gets the upper hand tyrannises over those which
were in power before it.

There are found all kinds of animals and plants passing through strange
developments.

"'Now if you turn to the East[39] you will see a region where there
is no human being, nor plant, nor tree, nor animal; it is an immense
and empty plain.

Crossing it, you will reach a mountainous region, where are clouds and
strong winds and rapid rivers; there are also gold and silver and
precious stones, but no plants.

From thence you will pass into a region where there are plants but no
animals, then into another where there are animals but no men. Lastly
you will arrive at a region where there are human beings such as
are familiar to you.

"'After passing the extreme limit of the East, you will see the sun
rising between the two horns of Satan, "the flying horn" and "the
marching horn."

This latter is divided into two parts, one having the form of a
fierce animal, the other of a gross one; between these two composing
the left horn is perpetual strife.

As to "the flying horn," it has no one distinct form, but is composed of
several, such as a winged man, a serpent with a swine's head, or merely
a foot or an arm.

The human soul which rules this region has established five ways of
communication under the care of a watchman who takes whatever comes
along them and passes it on to a treasurer who presents it to the
King.

"'The two horns continually attack the human soul, even to the point
of driving it to madness.

As to "the marching horn," the fierce animal of which it is partly
composed lays a trap for man by embellishing in his eyes all his
evil actions, murder, mutilation, oppression and destruction, by
exciting his hatred and impelling him to violence and injustice;
while the other part in the shape of a gross animal continually
attacks the human soul by casting a glamour over vileness and
foulness and urging her thereto; nor does it cease its assaults
till she is brought into complete subjection.

Look, Fellow, you wouldn't be from one of
those clans, would you now?"

Don shook his head. "I am Kalo," he said, "of the mountains. I have no
clan. I make mats. And twice a year I come here to Riandar to sell
them."

"Been here before?"

"I have been in Riandar many times."

"That's not what I mean. Have you been here--to this store--before?"

Don shook his head. "Not to this store, no. But they told me the Blue
Mountain was paying better than some others. I thought I'd try----"

[Illustration]

"Yeah," the other said coldly. "Sure. Now, suppose we take a little
walk, you and I? Some people down the street would like to talk to
you."

Don shook his head. "I merely came here to sell mats," he insisted. "I
make good mats."

The heavy man frowned. "Maybe," he snapped. "We'll see about that after
we've had a talk with you." He stepped closer. "If you're just a mat
maker, nothing will happen to you. If you really have good mats, you
might even get a nice price for some of your stuff. Come on."

He reached out to take Don's sleeve. Don stepped back, his face
suddenly losing its vague, apologetic expression. His features
sharpened, to become hard, uncompromising.

"Get over to that wall, Fellow," he ordered sharply. "Move!"

The man's hand dropped. For a moment, he stared slackly at Don.

"Come on!" Don's voice raised a little. "Get over to that wall. And
then stand still." He started to shuck off the straps of his pack.

The man before him sobbed helplessly, then shuffled away. Don knelt
down and stripped the pack off. Then he stepped aside and raised a hand
in a beckoning gesture.

"Now get over here," he snapped. "Pick up that pack and take it up to
Mr. Tona's office. I'll follow you."

The man in the cubby rubbed his head for a moment, then picked up the
phone. Don swung toward him. "Put that phone back," he ordered, "and
come out of there. You're coming with us."

                    *      *      *      *      *

Korentona looked up as the small procession entered his office.

"What's happened now?"

Don nodded at him, then faced the man with the pack.

"Put that pack down," he commanded. "Now, stand over there." He
pointed. "And be very quiet." He glanced at the doorman.

"You can stay where you are." He looked at Korentona.

"My apologies," he said, "for being so informal. But I come from the
Kor-en, and I had a little trouble. There's a message for you in the
pack. You know, of course, where to find it. Who are these two?"

Korentona looked worried. "This one," he pointed at the doorman, "is a
trusted employee. He's been with me for years."

He paused, looking at the other man. "But this one, I have never
trusted. I'm sure he reports to the police."

Don glanced at the doorman. "My apologies," he said. "You are free to
go as you will." He looked closely at the other.

"Is this correct?" he demanded. "Are you a police agent?"

The man nodded. "That's right," he said reluctantly. "I'm supposed to
watch this place and report on its visitors."

"Here," Don told him, "is one visitor you won't report." He stopped,
considering, then impaled the man with a cold stare.

"Have you ever seen a man bitten by a gersal?"

The man shrugged. "Yeah. What about it?"

Don nodded. "You will remember that scene," he said. "Do you remember
that man's struggles? Do you remember the animal, chewing at him,
injecting its poison? Do you remember this man dropping, first to his
knees, then to his back? Do you remember----"

"Hey!" protested the other. His hands came up before his face.

"Put those hands down," snapped Don. "And listen closely. I want you to
have full recall on this. You remember this man who was bitten, how he
sobbed for breath--how his legs stretched out and his back arched, till
the muscles tore from the bones with their effort. You remember all
this?"

The man nodded wordlessly, his fascinated stare fixed on Don's face.

"Then I want you to fix this in your mind," Don told him. "Should you
be so unwise as to attempt to mention any of these things that have
happened since you came down those stairs--should you even allow your
memory to dwell on these things for too long--these are the things that
will happen to you.

"You will sink to your knees. Your muscles will be unable to support
you, and you will fall to your back. You will find it impossible to
breathe, for the muscles of your chest will distend the ribs. And in
your struggles, you will break bones. And you will tear your body to
bits. Do you understand this?"

The man sagged against the wall, panting. He managed a nod.

"Then forget about this afternoon," commanded Don. "Go about your
business in normal fashion. And forget about this afternoon. Nothing
happened that was worthy of note." He waved a hand in dismissal, then
turned to Korentona.

"I don't want to go into a lot of detail," he said. "As I said, there's
a detailed message in the pack. I'll wait for you to read it." He
glanced down at his clothing.

"I'd like a place, though, where I can clean up. And I could use some
other clothes, if you don't mind."

                    *      *      *      *      *

When he came back to the office, Korentona waved him to a chair.

"So," he said musingly, "they were right. You did go to the clans for
aid." He smiled.

"The police have been keeping close watch on everyone in the city who
might have even a remote connection with the hill clans. And they're
really keeping an eye on the Waern home. You're going to have a nice
time getting in there."

Don nodded. "I expected some trouble. Do you know whether they've done
any searching?"

Korentona shrugged. "I don't run an investigative agency," he said with
a smile, "so I don't know everything that's going on. But I've heard
there've been lights on up there nearly every night. And they've had
crowds of people around the place. Not so much activity the last couple
of days, though. They're just watching."

"I see," Don nodded. "Wonder if they've found what they were looking
for?"

The other shook his head, "Doubt it," he said. "If they had, they'd
relax. Now that I know what it's all about, I can figure out what I've
heard. They'll take off the watch as soon as they find that book, I
think.

"Oh, of course, they still want you," he added. "And they'd like to get
their hands on the Waernu. But they wouldn't be frantic about it if
they weren't worried about the outcome of a conclave."

"No," agreed Don. "I guess they wouldn't, at that."

He stretched. "Well, guess I'd better get on my way. I've got to get
into that house somehow. Think I'll take a wander out there and see if
I can get some ideas."

The merchant put up a detaining hand. "Take it slow," he advised. "What!"
said the owner, "you have eaten these pomegranates so long, and
cannot distinguish the sweet from the bitter?"

"Sir," replied Ibrahim, "you told me to take charge of the orchard,
but you did not tell me to eat the pomegranates."

"Ah," replied the other, "to judge by your austerity, you must be no
other than Ibrahim ben Adham." The latter, seeing that he was
discovered, left the orchard and departed.

A story told by Ibrahim was as follows.

"One night I saw in a dream Gabriel, with a piece of paper in his
hand.

'What are you doing?' I asked him.

'I am writing on this sheet of paper the names of the friends of the
Lord.' 'Will you write mine among them?' Ibrahim asked. 'But you are
not one of His friends.'

'If I am not one of His friends, at least I am a friend of His
friends.'

Immediately a Voice was heard, 'O Gabriel, write Ibrahim's name on the
first line, for he who loves Our friends is Our friend.'"[12]
Once while Ibrahim was walking in the country, a horseman met him
and asked him who he was, "I am," answered Ibrahim, "the servant
of the Most High."

"Well," said the horseman, "direct me to the nearest dwellings." Ibrahim
pointed to the cemetery.

"You are jesting at me," the other cried, and struck him on the
head so severely that the blood began to flow.

Then he tied a cord round his neck, and dragged him forcibly into
the middle of the neighbouring town. The people cried out "Madman, what
are you doing?

It is Ibrahim ben Adham." Immediately the horseman prostrated himself
before Ibrahim and implored his pardon. "O Ibrahim," he said, "when I
asked you where were the nearest dwellings, why did you point to
the cemetery?"

"Every day," he answered, "the cemetery becomes more and more peopled,
while the town and its most flourishing quarters are continually
falling into ruins."

When Ibrahim's last hour arrived, he disappeared from sight, and no one
has been able to say exactly where his tomb is.

Some say it is at Bagdad, others at Damascus, others at Pentapolis.

When he died, a Voice was heard saying, "The man who excelled all others
in faith is dead; Ibrahim ben Adham has passed away

."

[11] According to the Mahommadan belief every man as soon as he is
buried is examined by these two angels.

[12] Leigh Hunt's well known poem refers to this:
"Abou ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)"

Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, And saw within the moonlight
in his room, Making it rich and like a lily in bloom, An angel writing
in a book of gold.
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, And to the presence in the
room he said:
"What writest thou?"

The vision raised its head, And with a look made all of sweet accord,
Answered "The names of those who love the Lord," "And is mine one?" said
Abou. "Nay not so," Replied the Angel. Abou spoke more low But
cheerily still; and said: "I pray thee then Write me as one that loves
his fellow men."

The angel wrote and vanished. The next night He came again with a
great wakening light, And showed the names whom love of God had
blest, And lo!

                    Ben Adhem's name led all the rest."

CHAPTER V
FUDHAYL BEN AYAZ, THE HIGHWAYMAN (D 803 AD)

In the beginning of his career Fudhayl ben Ayaz was a highwayman, and
used to pitch his tent on the plains between Merv and Abiwerd. He had
collected many other robbers round him; when they brought in booty,
he, as their chief, apportioned it.

He never neglected saying the Friday prayers, and dismissed any of
his servants whom he found neglecting them.

One day his men were lying in wait on the high road when a numerous
caravan arrived and fell into their clutches. In this caravan was a
merchant who had a large sum of money in his purse. Desirous of hiding
it, he fled towards the open plain; there he found a tent and a
man clothed in coarse garments seated in it.

The merchant, having explained the matter to him, was told to leave
his money there. He did so, and returned to the caravan. When he
got there he saw that the robbers had attacked it and taken all
the goods, after having bound and laid on the earth all the travellers.

He ransomed them, and helped them to gather together the remains
of their property.

When he returned to the tent he found the robbers there dividing
their booty. Seeing this, he said, "Woe is me!

Then he whom I trusted my money to was a robber."

He was on the point of departing when Fudhayl called out to him, "What
is the matter?" "I had come," he answered, "to take back my money which
I had deposited here."

"Well," said Fudhayl, "you will find it where you placed it." The
merchant did so.

"But," cried Fudhayl's companions, "we did not find any coined money at
all in this caravan; how is it that you hand over such a large sum?"
"This man," answered Fudhayl, "has trusted me in the simplicity of his
heart; now I, in the simplicity of my heart, trust in the Lord;
and just as I have justified the good opinion which the merchant
had of me, I hope the Lord will justify that which I have of Him."

The conversion of Fudhayl to an ascetic life took place in the following
manner. As he was climbing over a wall to see a girl whom he loved, he
heard a voice pronounce this verse of the Koran: "Is not the time
yet come unto those who believe that their hearts should humbly
submit to the admonition of God?"

[13] On this he exclaimed, "O Lord, that time is come." He then went away
from the place, and the approach of night induced him to repair
for shelter to a ruined edifice.

A caravan was encamped not far off, and Fudhayl heard one of the
travellers say to another, "We must rise and be going, lest Fudhayl
should arrive and rob us."

Fudhayl then came forward and said, "I have good news for you.
Fudhayl has entered upon the path of penitence, and is more likely
to flee from you than you from him."

Then he departed, after having asked their pardon for his former
misdeeds. For some time he resided at Mecca, where he received
instruction from Abou Hanifeh, and subsequently returned to his own
country, where his sanctity became widespread.

It is related that one night the Caliph Harun-al-Rashid said to Fazl the
Barmecide, "Take me to a man by whose aid I may rise out of the moral
torpor into which I have fallen." Fazl took him to the door of a
celebrated ascetic, Sofyan ibn Oyaina, who asked on their knocking,
"Who is there?"

"The Prince of the Faithful," answered Fazl. "Why did you not send for
me?" said Sofyan, "I would have come myself in person to serve him."
Al-Rashid, hearing this, said, "This is not the man I seek."

They then departed, and knocked at the door of Fudhayl. As they
arrived, the latter was reciting the following verse of the Koran: "Do
those who have done evil imagine that we shall set them on the
same level with those who have done well?"

Koran (Sura xlv., v. 20). The Caliph had no sooner heard this verse
than he said, "If it is good advice we are seeking, here is enough
for us." Then they knocked at the door. "Who is there?" asked Fudhayl.
"The Prince of the Faithful," Fazl answered.

"What do you want?" was the reply; "I have nothing to do with you,
leave me alone and don't waste my time."

"But you should treat the Caliph with honour, and let us in."

"It is for you to come in if you must, in spite of me," answered
Fudhayl.

                    When the Caliph and his attendant entered, Fudhayl extinguished the
lamp in order not to see the intruders.

Harun-al-Rashid, having touched Fudhayl's hand in the dark, the latter
exclaimed, "How soft this hand is; may it escape hell fire." Having
thus spoken, he rose to pray. As for the Caliph, he began to weep, and
said, "Speak to me at least one word."

Fudhayl, when he had finished his prayers, said to him, "O Harun, thy
ancestor Abbas, who was the paternal uncle of the Prophet (on
whom be peace!) said to him one day, O Prophet of God, make me ruler
over a nation. The Prophet replied, I have made thee ruler over
thyself.

If thou rulest thine own body and keepest it constant in the service
of the Lord, that is better than ruling a nation for a thousand
years.

Again, Omar, the son of Abd al Aziz, being installed on the throne of
the Caliphate, sent for three of his intimate friends, and said
to them, 'Behold me caught in the toils of the Caliphate; how shall
I get rid of them?

Many people consider power a blessing; I regard it as a calamity.'"

Then Fudhayl added, "O Harun, if thou wishest to escape the punishment
of the Day of Judgment, regard each old man among the Moslems as thy
father, the young men as thy brothers, the women as thy sisters.

O Harun, I fear lest thy handsome visage be scorched by the flames of
hell. Fear the Most High, and know that He will interrogate thee
on the Day of Resurrection."

At these words, Harun-al-Rashid wept copiously.

Then Fazl said to Fudhayl, "Say no more; you have killed the Caliph
with grief." "Oh Haman!"[14] Fudhayl answered, "it is not I, it is
thou and thy relations who have misled the Caliph and destroyed him."
Hearing these words, Harun-al-Rashid wept still more bitterly, and
said to Fazl, "Be silent!

If he has called you Haman, he has (tacitly) compared me to Pharaoh."
Then, addressing Fudhayl, he asked him, "Have you any debt to pay?"
"Yes," he answered, "that of the service which I owe to the Most High.
He furnishes me with subsistence, I have no need to borrow."
Then Harun-al-Rashid placed in Fudhayl's hand a purse in which
were a thousand pieces of gold, saying, "This money is lawfully
acquired, I have inherited it from my mother."

"Ah!" exclaimed Fudhayl, "my advice has been wasted; my object in
giving it was to lighten thy burden; thou seekest to make mine more
heavy."

At these words, Harun-al-Rashid rose, saluted him, and departed. All the
way home he kept repeating to himself, "This Fudhayl is a great
teacher." On another occasion the Caliph is reported to have said
to Fudhayl, "How great is thy self-abnegation," to which Fudhayl
made answer, "Thine is greater."

"How so?" said the Caliph. "Because I make abnegation of this world, and
thou makest abnegation of the next; now this world is transitory,
and the next will endure for ever."

Sofiân Tsavri relates the following anecdote. "One night I was talking
with Fudhayl, and after we had been conversing on all kinds of
subjects, I said to him, 'What a pleasant evening we have had, and
what interesting conversation.'

'No,' he said, 'neither the evening nor the conversation have been
good.' 'Why so?' I remarked. 'Because,' he said, 'you sought to speak
words which might please me, and I sought to answer so as to gratify
you.

Both of us, pre-occupied with our talk, had forgotten the Most High. It
would be better for each of us to sit still in his place and to lift
up his heart towards God.'"
A stranger coming to Fudhayl one day was asked by the latter for
what purpose he came.

                    "I have come," he answered, "to talk with you, and to find in so
doing calm of mind," "That is to say," broke in Fudhayl, "you wish
to mislead me with lies, and desire me to do the same to you.

Be off about your business."
[15]But with all his austerity of life, his prolonged fasts and
watchings, his ragged dress and wearisome pilgrimages, he preferred
the practice of interior virtue and purity of intention to all
outward observances, and used often to say that "he who is modest
and compliant to others and lives in meekness and patience gains a
higher reward by so doing than if he fasted all his days and watched
in prayer all his nights."

At so high a price did he place obedience to a spiritual guide, and
so necessary did he deem it, that he declared, "Had I a promise of
whatever I should ask in prayer, yet would I not offer that prayer
save in union with a superior."

But his favourite virtue was the love of God in perfect conformity to His
will above all hope or fear.

Thus, when his only son (whose virtues resembled his father's) died
in early age, Fudhayl was seen with a countenance of unusual
cheerfulness, and, being asked by his intimate disciple, Abou Ali,
the reason wherefore, he answered, "It was God's good pleasure, and
it is therefore my good pleasure also."

Others of his sayings are the following: "To leave aught undone for the
esteem of men is hypocrisy, and to do ought for their esteem is idolatry."
"Much is he beguiled who serves God for fear or hope, for His true
service is for mere love." "I serve God because I cannot help serving
Him for very love's sake."
[13] Koran, Sura 57, v 15.

[14] According to the Koran, Haman was the vizier of Pharaoh whom
he misled by bad advice

CHAPTER VI
BAYAZID BASTAMI (D 874 AD)

Bayazid Bastami, whose grandfather was a Zoroastrian converted to Islam,
was distinguished for his piety while still a child. His mother
used to send him regularly to the mosque to read the Koran with a
mullah. When he reached the chapter "Luqman," he read the verse,
"Show thy gratitude in serving Me, and show thy gratitude to thy
parents in serving them."

He asked his teacher the meaning of the verse, and had no sooner
heard it explained than he immediately ran home.

When she saw him, his mother said, "Why have you come home so early, my
child? Have they sent you for the fees?" "Mother," answered Bayezid,
"I have just read the verse in which the Lord commands me to serve Him,
and to serve thee; but, as I cannot serve in two places at once,
I have come to propose to you that you should ask the Lord to give
me to you in order that I may serve you, or that you should yourself
give me to the Lord that I may serve Him."

"Since that is the case," said his mother, "I give you up to the
Lord, and renounce all my rights over you."

Accordingly, a few years afterwards, Bayazid left his native village
Bastam, and for thirty years lived as a bare-footed ascetic in the deserts
of Syria.

Once during this time Bayazid came home and listened at the door
of his mother's house before going in.

He heard her saying in prayer, "May God bless my poor exile, may the
hearts of the pious be rejoiced by him and accord him grace."

Bayazid, hearing these words, wept, and knocked at the door.

"Who is there?" she asked. "Thy exile," he answered. No sooner had she
opened the door than, embracing Bayazid, she said to him, weeping, "O
my son, separated from thee as I have been, my eyes have lost the
power to see, and my back is bent," and they both mingled their
tears together.

Some time after Bayazid said to a friend, "What I ought to have known
most clearly is just what I have only learnt when too late--to serve
my mother.

That which I sought in devoting myself to so many religious exercises,
in putting myself at the service of others, and in exiling myself far
from my kindred and my country, see, how I have discovered it. One
night when my mother asked for water, as there was none in the
pitcher, I went to the canal to draw some.

                    It was a winter night, and the frost was very sharp.

While I had gone for the water, my mother had fallen asleep again.
I stood waiting with the full pitcher in my hand till she should awake.
When she did so, she asked for water, but when I wished to give
it her, I found that the water was frozen, and the handle of the
jug stuck fast to my hand.

'Why,' said my mother, 'did you not put it down?' 'Because I feared,' I
answered, 'not to be ready when you asked for it.' That same night
the Lord revealed to me all that I wanted to know."

Bayazid used to tell the following story. "A man came to see me, and
asked where I was going. 'I am going to Mecca,' I said, 'to make the
circuit of the Kaaba.'[16] 'How much money hast thou?' he asked. 'Two
hundred pieces of gold,' I answered.

'Very well,' he said, 'give them me and walk seven times round me.
By this act of charity thou wilt deserve a greater recompense than
thou wouldest obtain at the Kaaba.'[17] I did as he asked, and that
year I did not make the pilgrimage."

One day the thought crossed Bayazid's mind that he was the greatest
Sufi of the age. But no sooner had it done so, than he understood it
was an aberration on his part. "I rose immediately," he said, "and
went some way into the desert of Khorassan, where I sat down. I took
then the resolution of not moving from the spot where I was seated
till the Lord should send me someone who would make me see myself
as I really was.

I waited thus for three days and three nights. On the fourth night a
rider on a camel approached. I perceived on his countenance the marks
of a penetrating mind. He halted, and, fixing his eyes on me, said,
'Thou desirest doubtless, that in the twinkling of an eye I should
cause to be swallowed up the village of Bastam and all its population,
together with its riches, and Bayazid himself.'

At these words I was seized with an indescribable fear, and asked him,
'Whence comest thou?'

'O Bayazid,' he answered, 'while thou hast been seated here I have
travelled three thousand miles. Take care, O Bayazid, to place a curb
on thy heart, and not to forget the road; else shalt thou infallibly
perish.'

Then he turned his back and departed."
"Let yourself get emotionally involved in a problem and it'll turn
around and bite you."

He forced himself to sit back, his hands away from the controls.

Then he looked back at the body on the courtyard paving.

[Illustration]

Gorham had implied that he was the power behind the whole present
regime. Maybe he'd been bragging. But again, maybe he hadn't. There had
been a queer, hard force about the man. There had been an aura which
Don had sensed, but could not analyze. One thing was certain. This man
had never been able to work under someone else's orders.

He looked around the interior of the flier.

"It's a Royal Guard job," he told himself.

He could see painted legends, giving cautions and instructions to
whomever should pilot the ship. He felt under the dash.

There was a light board snapped into clips. He pulled it out and turned
on the cabin lights.

Yes, it was all there. Instructions for the identification
devices--description of the identification and warning lights. It gave
the location of switches--the settings for communications. There was
even a small card inserted in a pocket. It gave the communications code
used by patrol fliers in routine communication. Don smiled happily.

Now, he could fly back to the hills. It would only take a few minutes,
and----

Why should he? There was an easier way now.

It would be much easier to ride this flier right on into Oreladar. If
he headed for the hills, questions might be asked which would be hard
to answer. But Oreladar would be the normal place for Gorham to go. And
the Federation compound wasn't too far from the Palace. He could feint
at the Palace landing pad, then---- He nodded and studied the lighting
plan and identification settings.

At last, he nodded in satisfaction, then turned his attention to the
small card with the operations code. It was a simple, systematic
arrangement, obviously arranged for day-to-day use, not for secrecy. He
nodded and clipped it in front of him under the panel light, where he
could see it easily. Then, he looked thoughtfully at the courtyard.

There was a small chance that some guard might decide to come into the
house, he decided. Of course, it was still to be regarded as a private
home, and they had no right to---- He laughed sarcastically.

"That would worry them!" he said aloud.

He got out of the flier and leaned over the body of Gorham. It was
surprisingly light. The man had been carrying almost unbelievable
strength and power of will in a tiny, frail body. Don threw his load
over his shoulder and climbed back into the flier. Then he sat back and
looked dully at the control panel.

                    *      *      *      *      *

Suddenly, he felt completely drained. It was just too much effort to
get this ship off the ground. And that long flight to Oreladar? Just
how much was a guy supposed to do in one day?

He sat supinely for a few minutes, simply staring at a nothingness
beneath the surface of the panel. A small noise from the house aroused
him, and he jerked up. He'd have to move.

Unwillingly, he pulled at the controls and the flier raised from the
paving.

A blast of air hit the side of his face and he turned his head. He'd
forgotten to close the door. He snarled at himself in annoyance, then
leaned over and jerked at the handle. The ship swayed and dipped toward
the lighted streets and he straightened quickly and righted it with a
jerk. Then he snapped off the cabin lights and reached down to set up
the identification patterns.

A tinny voice snapped at him.

"Rano ninety-one, Riandar control. Seven three seven."

Don looked at the code card before him. Yes, there it was. "Return to
station." He glanced at the call sign on the panel before him. He was
Onarati three. He nodded. Only an important official would be in this
flier. Probably Gorham hadn't been bragging so much.

Another voice had acknowledged the order. Don looked at the speaker
grill and shrugged. He set his course southward.

Again and again, the speaker rattled with calls and answers. Riandar
control appeared to be busy tonight. Don smiled.

"The busier they are, the better," he told himself. "Then they can't
bother me." He coughed.

"Wonder how Korentana made out?" He looked overside.

Abruptly, he was aware of another flier close to his. On its top a blue
light blinked glaringly. He looked at it in consternation. Had
they----? But how? He started to pull the control to him and go into
evasive flight. Then he stopped.

"Use your head," he advised himself.

He reached out and scooped up the microphone. For an instant, he looked
into space, thinking, then he spoke.

"Riandar control," he snarled in an imitation of Gorham's voice.
"Onarati three. Got one of your guys on my back. What's the idea?" He
released the button.

"Oh, boy," he told himself, "I hope that's the right approach." He
looked toward the back of the cabin. If his short contact with Gorham
had told him enough, and if he'd judged correctly ... and if Gorham
was----

The speaker crackled. "Onarati three, Riandar control," it said. "Seven
zero five?"

Don looked down at the card under the panel light. Yes, there it was.
"Give your location."

He mashed the microphone button again. "Seven hundred meters," he
snarled impatiently. "South edge of town. Come on, what's this guy
doing, riding my tail?"

Another voice intruded into the speaker. "Your pardon, Onarati three,"
it said. "This is Rano two four. We cannot read your identification
lights."

Don looked down at the panel, then shook his head in annoyance. He'd
neglected one switch. He reached out and snapped it on. Then he pushed
the mike button again.

"So now you happy?" he demanded. "So why ain't ya telling me something,
instead of coming around with all them blinking lights?"

The other flier sheered away, its blinker off.

"Your pardon," said the speaker. "We were not sure."

Don sighed in relief. That had been too close for comfort. He glanced
down, then blinked and looked again.

"Oh, no!" he growled incredulously. "I left my clothes by the pool."

                    *      *      *      *      *

Kent Michaels opened his eyes. In front of him was a shattered
windshield. The light support struts were bent back. The heavy plastic
had crackled and powdered. He stared at it. It must have been quite an
impact. All he could remember was confused motion, then blackness.

He shook his head to clear his vision, then started to unfasten his
seat belt.

And his whole left side exploded as each individual muscle and nerve
set up a separate protest. He gritted his teeth against the sharp, red
knives of agony.

"Got to reach that belt and get out of here," he told himself. "Wonder
how long I've been out?"

He forced his hand to the buckle, then stopped.

"Oh, sure, you idiot," he said aloud. "Go ahead and let the belt go.
You can't hurt yourself by landing on your thick head."

He forced himself to ignore the agony in his side and shoulder and
looked around the cabin. Evidently, the ship had hit and rolled. He
closed his eyes, trying to remember.

He'd evaded the pass that first guy had made at him. Then, when the
second one showed up and dove in, he'd gone into a dead-duck spin. So
far, so good. Evidently, they'd been fooled. Probably never saw that
gag before. But what had happened after that? He searched his memory.

Oh, sure. He'd spun the ship under this overhang and set it down. And
the ground had double-crossed him. Even a duck couldn't have kept a
foothold on that ledge. He could remember the sudden tilt as the flier
slid over and started to roll. Then everything had happened at once. He
could remember trying to hold off the windshield from beating his
brains out, but---- He opened his eyes. No use trying to analyze that
part of it. Things had become confusing.

No matter how you figured it, he was here, hanging upside down in his
seat belt in a pretty thoroughly wrinkled up ship. He moved his left
arm experimentally.

His side went into screaming agony again.

Well, anyway, the shoulder wasn't broken. It could move--a little.

"Great," he told himself. "Now, how do you get out of this seat belt
without breaking your stupid neck?"

He reached out with his right hand, to feel the padded roof under him.
Well, maybe he could---- He set his teeth and forced his left hand to
the belt release. If he could just hold enough weight with that right
hand so that---- Well, no use worrying about it. Something had to be
done. He pushed against the release. The shoulder screamed almost
aloud. He started levering the buckle apart with his thumb.

Suddenly, the belt let go and he was struggling to put enough power
into his right arm to hold himself away from the approaching roof.

For a seeming eternity, he struggled to maintain his balance and ease
himself down. Then there was a soft bump. He sank into soft, cushioned
blackness.

It was dark when he opened his eyes again. Incuriously, he rolled his
eyes from side to side. He could see nothing. He let himself slip back
into the soft nothingness.

Slowly, he came back to being. For a timeless instant, he examined a
cushion which lay just before his eyes. Then pain messages started
clamoring for attention. There were too many of them to unscramble.
Everything was screaming at once.

He breathed in shallow gasps, then forced himself out of his cramped
position. At last, he managed to get to his knees and crawl out of the
gaping hole where a door had been. Outside, he collapsed to the ground
and lay, panting.

Slowly, he gathered strength and struggled to his feet. At least, his
legs were in working order.

He looked back at the ship, then whistled.

"What a mess! How'd I ever get out of that one?"

He shook his head to clear it, then examined the cave.

The ledge, he discovered, wasn't particularly high. It had just been
enough to roll the ship. The slope of the ground and the back wall of
the cave had done the real damage. He reached out with his right hand
and grabbed a vine. Yes, he could walk himself up the ledge with that.
And that would get him out of here.

He turned back and inched himself inside the flier again. The emergency
food pack was there. Unbroken, too. He fished it out and opened it,
forcing the almost useless left arm to lend a little support as the
right worked at the fastenings.

The food concentrate actually tasted good.

It could be a lot worse, he thought. Those two murderers had jumped him
only a few kilometers from Kordu valley. Unless he was badly mistaken,
this would be Gharu Gorge. It was steep-walled, but it could be
climbed. And once he got to the rim, it would be only a days walk to
Korelanni.

"Not too bad," he told himself. "Anybody for mountain climbing?"

He got to his feet, reeling a little as his side protested against the
indignity of being forced into motion. Probably a broken rib or two, he
thought. He brought his right hand over and ran his fingers delicately
over the left collar bone, from neck to shoulder. Then, he nodded. It
seemed to be in one piece. Might be cracked, but it'd hold together--he
hoped.

Slowly, he started pulling himself up the bank, pausing now and then to
regain his balance and take a new grip.

                    *      *      *      *      *

Lieutenant Narn Hense gave a snort of irritation, then walked across
the guardroom and switched the television off. Those news broadcasts
gave him an acute, three-dimensional pain. It was normal, he supposed,
for propaganda to sneak into a state-controlled broadcast, but did it
have to be so damn----

"Oh, the devil with it," he said aloud. "I just help run the Security
Guard around here. The Commissioner can worry about policy--and
diplomatic relations, too."

He glanced at the clock on his desk, then reached out to grab his hat.

"Better take another look at the guard while I'm at it," he told
himself.

He strode out of the office, hooking his sidearm belt from a hanger as
he went by.

It would be a good idea, he decided, to check post number four first
this time. The landing pad guard had been a little less than perfectly
alert tonight.

"Probably worrying about last night," he told himself. He smiled
reminiscently.

Moresma had been pretty worried and scared when the patrol had brought
him in. They'd gotten him out of the jam and kept him out of trouble,
but it had been close. The local authorities didn't seem to have much
sense of humor when it came to Federation personnel. In fact, they
seemed to welcome incidents that could----

"Funny," he told himself. "There are plenty of Galactics here, too.
They get along fine, but let one of our guardsmen drop a chewing gum
wrapper---- Oh, well. One of those things, I guess." He walked around
the corner of the building and strode down a hedge bordered path.

As he walked, he looked about at the dark Commission buildings. It was
a large compound. There were several posts and it took a large security
guard detachment to give it adequate protection. He glanced up at the
sky.

A blue-lit flier was coming toward him, flying rather low. Suddenly,
its lights blinked out.

Hense looked at the suddenly dark shape incredulously. It seemed to be
arcing down, toward the compound. He started forward at a run.

Either that pilot was out of control, or he was crazy. In any event, he
was going to crash in the compound unless his luck was fantastically
good. He'd been coming in fast, too. The lights had indicated an
official Oredanian ship.

This, he decided, was definitely irregular.

As he got to the pad, the ship came to an abrupt halt overhead. Then,
it came down in a blur of speed. Not more than half a meter from the
pavement, it checked its fall and settled. A door popped open.

Hense flipped his light from his belt and snapped it on. The guard, he
noted approvingly, had been prompt. The man had dashed up and now stood
close by the flier, his weapon at the ready.

A figure came out of the flier and stopped.

"Put out that light!" snapped an annoyed voice.

to question him on this triple millet?''

would find nothing prayer, and what had been its result."

As for the first and second petitions," answered Zu'n Nun," God has
liberally granted them, and I trust in His goodness that He will
not refuse me the third."

During his last moments he was asked what he wished."

astonishing influence which he society, on princes and their courts,
and which caused much disquietude to others, He justifies them,

do I forget those who seek Me.'

I awoke from sleep, and repented of my impatient ambition." Zu'n Nun
had a disciple who had made the pilgrimage to the Kaaba are not
agreed regarding him.

Some of them question whether he were a thorough-going pantheist
account they give of his martyrdom with and his partizans arrested
low.

But the grand chamberlain Nasir was strongly in his favour, and opposed
this; his influence, however, being less than that of the vizier,
Hallaj and some of his followers were arrested.

When the latter were questioned, they admitted that they regarded their
leader as superior, since he raised the back dead; but when has
he was questioned himself, he said," God preserve me from claiming
divinity or the dignity of a recalled prophet; I am a mortal man
who adores the Most High."

The vizier then summoned two cadis[22] and. the principal theologians,
and desired that they should, give sentence against Hallaj.

They answered that they could not pronounce sentence without proofs
and without confession on the part of the accused.

The vizier, foiled in his attempt, caused Hallaj to be put on the
tattered robe, hung the water-skin round his neck, took the staff
brought several times before him, and tried by artfully devised
questions to elicit from him some heretical utterance, but in vain.

Finally succeeded in finding in one of his books the assertion that

In this chamber also he should, I. heard a voice saying unto
me,'Schakran, is it grief to thee that I forty omit let his head
be cut off, and his right body burnt."

Hallaj underwent the terrible punishment with admirable courage,
and when his body had been burnt the ashes were cast into the Tigris.

But his disciples did not believe in his death; they were persuaded
that a person resembling him had been martyred in his place, and
that he would show himself again your prayers, eat as much as you
like, and go to sleep.

Doubtless, if the Friend does not look upon you with an eye of by

The vizier eagerly caught up the expressions" O infidel," etc., which

near, tired out with pleasure and heavy with wine, I lay down to

travelling conclave through Khorassan, Seistan and Turkestan.

On his return to Bagdad, the of his followers largely increased, and he

One day, when Mansur was plying him with questions on certain obscure
and points, Junaid said," O Mansur, before very long you will
redden the the choicest food to thirty orphans, should wait them
himself, make them a present of clothing, Hallaj quoted a work of
Hassan of Basra, from which he said he had taken it."

his face towards the western gate of Bagdad, and set his foot on

Having a Persian, of Zoroastrian lineage, such a saying cannot be
reasonably explained."

The Caliph then ordered him whole year he continued to hold discussions
with the learned.

At end that time the Caliph forbade anyone should have access to him;
in consequence, no one went to see him for five except Abd Allah
Khafif.

Another time Ibn Ata sent someone to say to him," O Sheikh, man withdraw
what you said, so that you may escape death of it.""

What is then the highest?" asked"" One may day," said Zu'n Nun," when
I was travelling, I get at a plain covered with snow and.

forgiveness," replied Mansur. Ibn, hearing this, shed tears and said,"
Alas, he is irreparably!"

In He order to force him to retract round on them, he cried," True!
True! True! I am the Truth!" It is said that among them was a dervish
who asked him," What is love?"" Thou shalt understand," Mansur replied,"

gave them to him. He rod, but in it happened, that day he was put to
death, the next day his body was burnt, and on the third his ashes
were scattered to the winds.

He meant that such would be results of his love to God.

On his son asking of him a last You piece of advice," While the
people of the world, he said," spend their energies on earthly
objects, do thou apply thyself to a study, the least portion of

Then he added," My Host, in whom there is no injustice, he said. Then

Thus far the theologians' account.

of the scaffold, a, and think that he taught a numerical Pantheism, an
immanence of the Deity in certain souls only. this is not the
opinion of the majority of the Sufis.

The high esteem him is best understood by comparing the group of
his disciples called out to him of," What do you say regarding us,
thy disciples, and regarding those who deny thy claims and are about
to stone thee?

his"" They will have a two-fold reward, and you only single one,"
he answered," for"[29] Then he Shibli."

Thou canst not attain to it," he answered. Then they all began to
stone him. Shibli making common cause with the others threw mud at him.
Hallaj both worlds. Hew these off if ye can!" Then, looked with his
bleeding stumps, he rubbed his cheeks Jackson and arms." Why do you
do that?"

he was asked."

The latter runs as follows: The common people of Bagdad were

Junaid accordingly repaired to the college of the Ulama, where has

The expression on the Waern boy's face was perfect. He had him! He
looked about the room, then gazed sternly at the claimant.

"I find it almost impossible to believe," he said coldly, "that there
is a person in this realm who would have the temerity to bring such a
document to my attention for serious consideration."

He stabbed a finger out to point at the book and fixed Pete with an
accusing stare.

"I find this a complete forgery," he said harshly. "Your claim is, of
course, denied and declared fraudulent." He stepped around the rail, to
tower over the boy.

Stern watched them for a moment, then took Pete's arm. Together, they
walked down the long flight of steps. For a moment, they paused at the
path, as ritual demanded, for a signal to continue.

Stern allowed his thoughts to race.

There was no question about it now, he thought. This boy would be
upheld by the conclave--if he got before it. And if he were now
sustained, an ex-regent named Stern would find himself in very grave
trouble indeed.

This was much worse than that mob in Tonar City. He glanced toward the
gate in the wall ahead and to his right.

Just beyond that door lay his yacht--and safety. If he could only
figure out a way----

                    *      *      *      *      *

Across the lawn, a warden was making the signal for the advance. The
way, then, was ritually clear. Stern stepped forward, still glancing
toward that door.

They would pass within just a few meters of it. Now, where was that
Michaels?

Suddenly, he realized he could never hope to get out his hidden weapon,
find Michaels with it, and vaporize him. Not until the other had plenty
of time to release a beam of his own. He shuddered, remembering the
destruction that weapon had caused up in the Morek.

At this range, even the narrowest blaster beam would fan out enough to
destroy a man's entire body. And that thing, whatever it was----

Suddenly, he smiled. That was it! It would spread out too much.

He flipped out the little khroal from its hiding place in his sleeve
and placed it against Pete's back. With his other hand, he gripped the
boy around the throat. Then he turned, seeking to locate Michaels. The
fellow was out of sight.

But this great secret must not be divulged; it is only permissable

"So," he said thoughtfully, "it's all over." He sighed.

"And it's all just beginning, too. Now, I'll have to form a
government." He smiled sadly.

"It's funny, Don. For years, I've dreamed of actually being king. Now
it's suddenly happened and I feel about as helpless as they come." He
stretched out a hand. "All at once, I'm realizing it's pretty rough for
a schoolboy to suddenly find himself with a whole nation to run. I
don't know where to start."

"You'll get used to it, Pete." Don smiled at him. "Get yourself a few

and get some competent people to do things. He reproached himself bitterly for not having at once punished his
servant's insolence, and considered the death of Mujahid as a divine
punishment which menaced him also.

He immediately sent for the Qazi Afzal, one of his most devoted friends,
and told him of his anxiety. The latter was a friend of Akhund Mullah
Muhammad Synd, a disciple of Mullah Shah, and at his instance the
Sheikh consented to see the prince.

Dara-Shikoh could not pay his visit during the day, from fear
of arousing public curiosity, but as soon as night fell, he presented
himself before the Sheikh, whom this time he found seated in his
cell.

Before crossing the threshold, the Prince saluted the holy man
with profound respect, and the latter bade him enter and be seated.
