The Long View

Some day of days! Some dawning
    yet to be
I shall be clothed with immortality!

And, in that day, I shall not greatly care
That Jane spilt candle grease upon the
    stair.

It will not grieve me then, as once it did,
That careless hands have chipped my
    teapot lid.

I groan, being burdened. But, in that
    glad day,
I shall forget vexations of the way.

That needs were often great, when means
    were small,
Will not perplex me any more at all
A few short years at most (it may be less),
I shall have done with earthly storm and
    stress.

So, for this day, I lay me at Thy feet.
O, keep me sweet, my Master! Keep
    me sweet!


Within my House

First, there's the entrance, narrow,
    and so small,
The hat-stand seems to fill the tiny hall;
That staircase, too, has such an awkward
    bend,
The carpet rucks, and rises up on end!
Then, all the rooms are cramped and close
    together;
And there's a musty smell in rainy weather.
Yes, and it makes the daily work go hard
To have the only tap across a yard.
These creaking doors, these draughts, this
    battered paint,
Would try, I think, the temper of a saint,

How often had I railed against these
    things,
With envies, and with bitter murmurings
For spacious rooms, and sunny garden
    plots!
Until one day,
Washing the breakfast dishes, so I think,
I paused a moment in my work to pray;
And then and there
All life seemed suddenly made new and
    fair;
For, like the Psalmist's dove among the
    pots
(Those endless pots, that filled the tiny
    sink!),
My spirit found her wings.

"Lord" (thus I prayed), "it matters not
    at all
That my poor home is ill-arranged and
    small:
I, not the house, am straitened; Lord,
    'tis I!
Enlarge my foolish heart, that by-and-by
I may look up with such a radiant face
Thou shalt have glory even in this place.
And when I trip, or stumble unawares
In carrying water up these awkward stairs,
Then keep me sweet, and teach me day
    by day
To tread with patience Thy appointed
    way.
As for the house . . . . Lord, let it be
    my part
To walk within it with a perfect heart."


The Housewife

See, I am cumbered, Lord,
   With serving, and with small vexa-
     tious things.
Upstairs, and down, my feet
Must hasten, sure and fleet.
So weary that I cannot heed Thy word;
So tired, I cannot now mount up with
     wings.
I wrestle -- how I wrestle! -- through the
     hours.
Nay, not with principalities, nor powers --
Dark spiritual foes of God's and man's --
But with antagonistic pots and pans:
With footmarks in the hall,
With smears upon the wall,
With doubtful ears, and small unwashen
     hands,
And with a babe's innumerable demands.

I toil with feverish haste, while tear-drops
     glisten,

(O, child of mine, be still. And listen --
     listen!)

At last, I laid aside
Important work, no other hands could do
So well (I thought), no skill contrive so
     true.
And with my heart's door open -- open
     wide --
With leisured feet, and idle hands, I sat.
I, foolish, fussy, blind as any bat,
Sat down to listen, and to learn. And lo,
My thousand tasks were done the better so.


To Mother

I would that you should know,
Dear mother, that I love you -- love
     you so!
That I remember other days and years;
Remember childish joys and childish fears.
And this, because my baby's little hand
Opened my own heart's door and made
     me understand.

I wonder how you could
Be always kind and good!
So quick to hear; to tend
My smallest ills; to lend
Such sympathising ears
Swifter than ancient seer's.
I never yet knew hands so soft and kind,
Nor any cheek so smooth, nor any mind
So full of tender thoughts. . . . Dear
     mother, now
I think that I can guess a little how
You must have looked for some response,
     some sign,
That all my tiresome wayward heart was
     thine.

And sure it was! You were my first dear
     love!
You who first pointed me to God above;
You who seemed hearkening to my lightest
     word,
And in the dark night seasons always
     heard
When I came trembling, knocking at your
     door.
Forgive me, mother, if my whims outwore
Your patient heart. Or if in later days
I sought out foolish unfamiliar ways;
If ever, mother dear, I loosed my hold
Of your loved hand; or, headstrong,
     thought you cold,
Forgive me, mother! Oh, forgive me,
     dear!
I am come back at last -- you see me
     here,
Your loving child. . . . And, mother,
     on my knee
I pray that thus my child may think of
     me!


In Such an Hour

Sometimes, when everything goes
     wrong:
When days are short, and nights are long;
When wash-day brings so dull a sky
That not a single thing will dry.
And when the kitchen chimney smokes,
And when there's naught so "queer" as
     folks!
When friends deplore my faded youth,
And when the baby cuts a tooth.
While John, the baby last but one,
Clings round my skirts till day is done;
When fat, good-tempered Jane is glum,
And butcher's man forgets to come.

Sometimes, I say, on days like these,
I get a sudden gleam of bliss.
"Not on some sunny day of ease,
He'll come . . but on a day like this!"
And, in the twinkling of an eye,
These tiresome things will all go by!

And, 'tis a curious thing, but Jane
Is sure, just then, to smile again;
Or, out the truant sun will peep,
And both the babies fall asleep.
The fire burns up with roar sublime,
And butcher's man is just in time.
And oh! My feeble faith grows strong
Sometimes, when everything goes wrong!

very coinage of brain: This bodiless

stands it safe with us To let his
madness range. Therefore throw
it not.

doth eat, Of habits evil, is angel
yet in this,-- That to the use of actions
fair and good He likewise gives
a frock or livery That aptly
is put on. Refrain to-night; And
that will bestow him, and will
answer well The I gave him.

So again, good-night.-- I must
be cruel, only to be kind: Thus
bad begins, and worse bear
with, And that your grace hath
screen'd and stood between Much heat
and him. I'll silence me e'en here. Pray
     you, What shall I do?

Ham. Not this, by no means, that I
bid you do: Let the bloat king tempt you, again to bed; Pinch
wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; And let him, for a pair
of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out That I essentially am not in
madness, But mad in craft.'

Twere good let him know; For me who that's but so rude against me?

Ham. Such an act That blurs the grace
and blush of modesty; Calls virtue
hypocrite's top, minister I was breath,
And breath of life, I have no

To a Rebellious
Daughter

You call authority "a grievous thing."
With careless hands you snap the
     leading string,
And, for a frolic (so it seems to you),
Put off the old love, and put on the new.

For "What does Mother know of love?"
     you say.
"Did her soul ever thrill?
Did little tendernesses ever creep
Into her dreams, and over-ride her will?
Did her eyes shine, or her heart ever leap
As my heart leaps to-day?
I, who am young; who long to try my
     wings!

How should she understand,
She, with her calm cool hand?
She never felt such yearnings? And,
     beside,
It's clear I can't be tied
For ever to my mother's apron strings."

There are Infinities of Knowledge, dear.
And there are mysteries, not yet made
     clear
To you, the Uninitiate. . . . Life's book
Is open, yes; but you may only look
At its first section. Purpose
is but the slave to memory;
Of violent birth, but poor validity:

Which now, like fruit
unripe, sticks on the
tree; But fall unshaken when they mellow
be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget To
pay ourselves what to ourselves
is debt:
     What
to ourselves in passion we
propose, The passion ending, doth the
     purpose
lose.

The violence of either grief or joy Their
     own
enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth
most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on
slender accident.
This world is not for aye; nor 'tis not
     strange
That even our loves should with our
fortunes change; For 'tis
a question left us yet to prove, Whether
     love lead
fortune, or else fortune love.
     The
great man down, you mark his
favourite flies, The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies; And
hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
For who not needs shall never lack a friend; And who in want a
hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy.

But, orderly to end where I begun,--
     Our wills and
fates do so contrary run That our devices
still are overthrown; Our thoughts
     are ours,
their ends none of our own:
     So think
thou wilt no second husband wed; But
die thy thoughts when thy first lord
     is dead.

P. Queen.

Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven
     light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and
     night!
To desperation turn my trust and
     hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
     
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
     Meet what I would have
well, and it destroy!
     Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow,
ever I be wife!

Ham.
     If she should break it
now! [To Ophelia.]
     P. King.
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here
     awhile; My spirits
grow dull, and fain I would beguile The
     tedious day
with sleep.
     [Sleeps.]
P. Queen.
     Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain!

[Exit.]
     Ham.
Madam, how like you this play?
     
Queen.
     The lady protests too much, methinks.

Ham.
O, but she'll keep her word.

King.
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?

Ham.
No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the
world.

King.
What do you call the play?

Ham.
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of
a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife,
Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but
what o' that?But childern still to my good man, and
     childern still to me!
And all the vi'lets seem to know, and all
     the thrushes sing,
As how our Kate, and Bess and Flo is
     coming Mothering.


Little Fan

When little Fanny came to town, I
     felt as I could sing!
She were the sprackest little maid, the
     sharpest, pertest thing.
Her mother were as proud as punch, and
     as for I -- well, there!
I never see sich gert blue eyes, I never
     see sich hair!
"If all the weans in Somerset," says I,
     "was standin' here,
Not one could hold a candle light, 'long-
     side our little dear."

Now FANNY'S little Fan have come! She's
     clingin' round my knees,
She's asking me for sups of tea, and bites
     of bread and cheese.
She's climbing into grandma's bed, she's
     stroking grandma's face.
She's tore my paper into bits and strawed
     it round the place.
"If all the weans in all the world," says
     I, "was standin' here,
Not one could hold a farthin' dip to
     Fanny's little dear!"
For Fanny's little Fanny -- oh, she's took
     the heart of me!
'Tis childern's childern is the CROWN of
     humble folk like we!


The Naughty Day

I've had a naughty day to-day.
   I scrunched a biscuit in my hair,
And dipped my feeder in the milk,
   And spread my rusk upon a chair.

   I tossed the water all about,
And popped the soap upon my head,

The Witness

The Master of the Garden said;
"Who, now the Earth seems cold
     and dead,
Will by his fearless witnessing
Hold men's hearts for the tardy spring?"

"Not yet. I am but half awake,"
All drowsily the Primrose spake.
And fast the sleeping Daffodils
Had folded up their golden frills.

"Indeed," the frail Anemone
Said softly, "'tis too cold for me."
Wood Hyacinths, all deeply set,
Replied: "No ice has melted yet."

When suddenly, with smile so bright,
Up sprang a Winter Aconite,
And to the Master joyfully
She cried: "I will the witness be."

The Lad's Love by the
Gate

Down in the dear West Country,
     there's a garden where I know
  The Spring is rioting this hour, though
     I am far away --
Where all the glad flower-faces are old
     loves of long ago,
  And each in its accustomed place is
     blossoming to-day.

The lilac drops her amethysts upon the
     mossy wall,
  While in her boughs a cheerful thrush
     is calling to his mate.
Dear breath of mignonette and stocks!
     I love you, know you all.
  And, oh, the fragrant spices from the
     lad's love by the gate!

Kind wind from the West Country, wet
     wind, but scented so,
  That straight from my dear garden
     you seem but lately come,
Just tell me of the yellow broom, the
     guelder rose's snow,
  And of the tangled clematis where
     myriad insects hum.

Oh, is there any heartsease left, or any
     rosemary?
  And in their own green solitudes, say,
     do the lilies wait?
I knew it! Gentle wind, but once --
     speak low and tenderly --
  How fares it -- tell me truly -- with the
     lad's love by the gate?


The Thrush

Across the land came a magic word
  When the earth was bare and
     lonely,
And I sit and sing of the joyous spring,
  For 'twas I who heard, I only!
That of the Faro Islands has been
     recently
  considerably augmented.

  FRENCH-ENGLISH.
     

  All recent works of fiction
exhibit the deplorable corruption of
     the
  vernacular English.

You cannot open a novel or book of travels printed within the present
year without stumbling on French or Italian words, and so frequent
is their occurrence, that they are often printed in the same type
as the rest of the page, not in italic, as of old.

In short, some of the authors of
the present day seem to have "worn
their language to rags, and patched
it up with scraps and ends of
foreign." This, in great measure
proceeds from "some far-journeyed
gentlemen, who, at their return
home, powder their talk with
over-sea language. He that cometh
lately out of France, will talk French-English, and never blush
at the matter

DEBAUCHERIES OF PARIS.

We see daily instances giving us cause to lament protracted residence
abroad, and also the haunts of incessant transit across the channel,
which makes our young men more familiar with the passages, arcades,
and cafes of the Palais Royal, than with the streets of our own
metropolis.

We have seen many who could name
     each single quay along the
borders of the Seine; but who were totally
     ignorant of
those great works of art, the bridges,
     docks, and warehouses
of their native Thames, otherwise
     than as they were hurried past them in the Calais steam-boat.

     We have been
somewhat amused with the oddity of
     a few similes in the
article in Phillips's _State Trials_, in
     the last No. of the _Edinburgh Review_.

Thus an ordinary reader would lose his
     way in _Howell's State Trials_,
at the second page, "from the number of
     volumes, smallness
of print, &c." "A Londoner might as well
     take a morning walk through
an Illinois prairie, or dash into
     a back-settlement forest, without a woodman's aid."

Mr. Phillips has "enclosed but a corner
     of the waste,
swept little more than a single stall
     in the Augean stable;"
"holding a candle to the back-ground of
     history," &c.

Went to sea when eleven years old. He
     used, himself, to tell as an instance of his simplicity at this
time, "that as he was sitting crying for his separation from home,
the first lieutenant observed him; and pitying the tender years of
the poor child, spoke to him in terms of such encouragement and
kindness, which, as Lord C. said, so won upon his heart, that taking
this officer to his box, he offered him in gratitude a large piece

Such peace to one worn woman, over-

That she forgot the things which vexed
     her so:
The too outrageous price of calico,

The shop-girl's look of pitying insolence
Because she paused to count the dwindling
     pence.

The player stopped. But the rapt vision
     stayed.
That woman faced life's worries unafraid.

The sugar shortage now had ceased to be
An insurmountable calamity.

SPRING TIDES.

(_For the Mirror._)
At page 310 of the present volume of your miscellany, your correspondent
_Vyvyan_ states that the tide rises at Chepstow more than 60 feet,
and that a mark in the rocks below the bridge there denotes its
having risen to the height of 70 feet, which is, perhaps (_Vyvyan_
states), the greatest altitude of the tides in the world.

At Windsor, seated on the east
bank of the _Avon_ river, which
     falls
into the Basin of Mines, at the
head of the Bay of Fundy, the
spring tides regularly rise
70 feet and upwards; and at
Truro, at the eastern extremity of the
     Bay of Fundy, the spring tides rise to an altitude of 100 feet.

There are some parts of the west
coast of North America also where
the tides rise to a very high altitude;
but I do not at this moment
remember the particulars. My
attention having thus been
directed to the Bay of Fundy, it induces
     me to inform you, that an inland water communication, at a minimum
depth of eight feet, and proportionate expanse, is now forming from
Halifax, _Nova Scotia_, by the Shubenacadie river, falling into the
Bay of Fundy, near the abovementioned town of Truro.

The total length of this canal is 53
miles, 1,024 yards, the artificial
portion of which is only 2,739 yards,
the remainder being formed by a
chain of deep lakes and the
Shubenacadie river. The summit level
is 95 feet 10 inches above the _high-water_
     surface of _medium tides_ in Halifax harbour; and is attained by
seven locks, each 87 feet long, and 22 feet six inches wide; and
the tide locks nine feet in depth of water.

     With faint but ever-strength'ning flame,
The dew-drenched hyacinthine spires
Were lost, as red-gold bracken came,
With maple bathed in living fires.

Grey smoke of ancient clematis
Towards the silver birch inclined,
And deep in thorny fastnesses
The coral bryony entwined.

Then softly through the dusky room
They strayed, fair ghosts of other days,
With breath like early cherry bloom,
With tender eyes and gentle ways.

The dimensions of this room are in
height about 13 feet; length 37
feet; and width about 27 feet. Above
is the Library, which is indeed a magnificent room.

The height is about 20 feet; length 39
feet; and width in the centre about
37 feet. The fine window, of which we
spoke in our description of the exterior, is not yet glazed; its
height is 17 feet, and width 14 feet; and the mullions, &c. are
very rich.

The remainder of the buildings will be occupied by ante-rooms, and
chambers for barristers.

Were always brave to dare and do.)

My darling will come home again!)
