"Don't marry for a home, Waitstill! Your own mother did that, and so did
I, and we were both punished for it! You've been a great help and I've
had a sight of comfort out of the baby, but I wouldn't go through it
again, not even for her! You're real smart and capable for your age and
you've done your full share of the work every day, even when you were at
school. You can get along all right."

"I don't know how I'm going to do everything alone," said the girl,
forcing back her tears. "You've always made the brown bread, and mine
will never suit father. I suppose I can wash, but don't know how to iron
starched clothes, nor make pickles, and oh! I can never kill a rooster,
mother, it's no use to ask me to! I'm not big enough to be the head of
the family."

Mrs. Baxter turned her pale, tired face away from Waitstill's appealing
eyes.

"I know," she said faintly. "I hate to leave you to bear the brunt
alone, but I must!... Take good care of Patience and don't let her get
into trouble.... You won't, will you?"

"I'll be careful," promised Waitstill, sobbing quietly; "I'll do my
best."

"You've got more courage than ever I had; don't you s'pose you can
stiffen up and defend yourself a little mite?... Your father'd ought to
be opposed, for his own good... but I've never seen anybody that dared
do it." No, not one. "It has been slept in every night."
[Sidenote: Iron spring bedstead the best.]
[Sidenote: Comfort and cleanliness of _two_ beds.]
The only way of really nursing a real patient is to have an _iron_
bedstead, with rheocline springs, which are permeable by the air
up to the very mattress (no vallance, of course), the mattress to
be a thin hair one; the bed to be not above 3-1/2 feet wide.

If the patient be entirely confined to his bed, there should be
_two_ such bedsteads; each bed to be "made" with mattress, sheets,
blankets, &c., complete--the patient to pass twelve hours in each
bed; on no account to carry his sheets with him.

The whole of the bedding to be hung up to air for each intermediate
twelve hours. Of course there are many cases where this cannot be done
at all--many more where only an approach to it can be made. I am indicating
the ideal of nursing, and what I have actually had done. But about the
kind of bedstead there can be no doubt, whether there be one or two
provided.

[Sidenote: Bed not to be too wide.]
There is a prejudice in favour of a wide bed--I believe it to be a
prejudice.

All the refreshment of moving a patient from one side to the other of
his bed is far more effectually secured by putting him into a fresh bed;
and a patient who is really very ill does not stray far in bed. But
it is said there is no room to put a tray down on a narrow bed.
No good nurse will ever put a tray on a bed at all. If the patient can
turn on his side, he will eat more comfortably from a bed-side table;
and on no account whatever should a bed ever be higher than a
sofa.
Otherwise the patient feels himself "out of humanity's reach"; he can
get at nothing for himself: he can move nothing for himself. If the
patient cannot turn, a table over the bed is a better thing. I need hardly
say that a patient's bed should never have its side against the
wall.

The nurse must be able to get easily to both sides the bed, and to
reach easily every part of the patient without stretching--a thing
impossible if the bed be either too wide or too high.

[Sidenote: Bed not to be too high.]
When I see a patient in a room nine or ten feet high upon a bed
between four and five feet high, with his head, when he is sitting
up in bed, actually within two or three feet of the ceiling, I ask
myself, is this expressly planned to produce that peculiarly
distressing feeling common to the sick, viz., as if the walls and
ceiling were closing in upon them, and they becoming sandwiches
between floor and ceiling, which imagination is not, indeed, here
so far from the truth?

If, over and above this, the window stops short of the ceiling, then
the patient's head may literally be raised above the stratum of fresh
air, even when the window is open.

Can human perversity any farther go, in unmaking the process of restoration
which God has made? The fact is, that the heads of sleepers or of sick
should never be higher than the throat of the chimney, which ensures
their being in the current of best air.

And we will not suppose it possible that you have closed your chimney
with a chimney-board.

If a bed is higher than a sofa, the difference of the fatigue of getting
in and out of bed will just make the difference, very often, to
the patient (who can get in and out of bed at all) of being able to
take a few minutes' exercise, either in the open air or in another
room.

It is so very odd that people never think of this, or of how many more
times a patient who is in bed for the twenty-four hours is obliged to get
in and out of bed than they are, who only, it is to be hoped, get into
bed once and out of bed once during the twenty-four hours.

[Sidenote: Nor in a dark place.]
A patient's bed should always be in the lightest spot in the room;
and he should be able to see out of window.

[Sidenote: Nor a four poster with curtains.]

I need scarcely say that the old four-post bed with curtains is
utterly inadmissible, whether for sick or well. Hospital bedsteads are
in many respects very much less objectionable than private ones.

[Sidenote: Scrofula often a result of disposition of bedclothes.]
There is reason to believe that not a few of the apparently unaccountable
cases of scrofula among children proceed from the habit of sleeping with
the head under the bed clothes, and so inhaling air already breathed,
which is farther contaminated by exhalations from the skin.

Patients are sometimes given to a similar habit, and it often happens
that the bed clothes are so disposed that the patient must necessarily
breathe air more or less contaminated by exhalations from his skin. A
good nurse will be careful to attend to this. It is an important part,
so to speak, of ventilation.

[Sidenote: Bed sores.]
It may be worth while to remark, that where there is any danger of bed-sores
a blanket should never be placed _under_ the patient. It retains
damp and acts like a poultice.

[Sidenote: Heavy and impervious bedclothes.]
Never use anything but light Witney blankets as bed covering for the
sick. The heavy cotton impervious counterpane is bad, for the very
reason that it keeps in the emanations from the sick person, while
the blanket allows them to pass through.

Weak patients are invariably distressed by a great weight of
bed-clothes, which often prevents their getting any sound sleep
whatever.

NOTE.--One word about pillows. Every weak patient, be his illness what it
may, suffers more or less from difficulty in breathing. To take the
weight of the body off the poor chest, which is hardly up to its
work as it is, ought therefore to be the object of the nurse in
arranging his pillows.

Now what does she do and what are the consequences?

She piles the pillows one a-top of the other like a wall of bricks.
The head is thrown upon the chest.

And the shoulders are pushed forward, so as not to allow the lungs room
to expand.

The pillows, in fact, lean upon the patient, not the patient upon
the pillows.

It is impossible to give a rule for this, because it must vary with the
figure of the patient.

And tall patients suffer much more than short ones, because of the
_drag_ of the long limbs upon the waist.

But the object is to support, with the pillows, the back _below_
the breathing apparatus, to allow the shoulders room to fall back,
and to support the head, without throwing it forward.

The suffering of dying patients is immensely increased by neglect of these
points. And many an invalid, too weak to drag about his pillows himself,
slips his book or anything at hand behind the lower part of his
back to support it.

IX. LIGHT.

[Sidenote: Light essential to both health and recovery.]
It is the unqualified result of all my experience with the sick, that
second only to their need of fresh air is their need of light; that,
after a close room, what hurts them most is a dark room. And that it is
not only light but direct sun-light they want. I had rather have the
power of carrying my patient about after the sun, according to the
aspect of the rooms, if circumstances permit, than let him linger in a
room when the sun is off. People think the effect is upon the
spirits only. This is by no means the case. The sun is not only
a painter but a sculptor. You admit that he does the photograph.
Without going into any scientific exposition we must admit that light
has quite as real and tangible effects upon the human body.

But this is not all. Who has not observed the purifying effect of
light, and especially of direct sunlight, upon the air of a room?
Here is an observation within everybody's experience.

Go into a room where the shutters are always shut, (in a sick room or a
bedroom there should never be shutters shut), and though the room be
uninhabited, though the air has never been polluted by the breathing of
human beings, you will observe a close, musty smell of corrupt air, of
air i.e. unpurified by the effect of the sun's rays. The mustiness of
dark rooms and corners, indeed, is proverbial. The cheerfulness of a
room, the usefulness of light in treating disease is all-important.

[Sidenote: Aspect, view, and sunlight matters of first importance to the
sick.]
A very high authority in hospital construction has said that people
do not enough consider the difference between wards and dormitories
in planning their buildings. But I go farther, and say, that healthy
people never remember the difference between _bed_-rooms and
_sick_-rooms, in making arrangements for the sick. To a sleeper in health
it does not signify what the view is from his bed. He ought never to
be in it excepting when asleep, and at night.

Aspect does not very much signify either (provided the sun reach his
bed-room some time in every day, to purify the air), because he ought
never to be in his bed-room except during the hours when there is
no sun.

But the case is exactly reversed with the sick, even should they be
as many hours out of their beds as you are in yours, which probably
they are not. Therefore, that they should be able, without raising
themselves or turning in bed, to see out of window from their beds, to
see sky and sun-light at least, if you can show them nothing else,
I assert to be, if not of the very first importance for recovery,
at least something very near it.

And you should therefore look to the position of the beds of your
sick one of the very first things.

If they can see out of two windows instead of one, so much the better.
Again, the morning sun and the mid-day sun--the hours when they are quite
certain not to be up, are of more importance to them, if a choice
must be made, than the afternoon sun.

Perhaps you can take them out of bed in the afternoon and set them
by the window, where they can see the sun. But the best rule is, if
possible, to give them direct sun-light from the moment he rises till
the moment he sets.

Another great difference between the _bed_-room and the _sick_-room is,
that the _sleeper_ has a very large balance of fresh air to begin
with, when he begins the night, if his room has been open all day
as it ought to be; the _sick_ man has not, because all day he has
been breathing the air in the same room, and dirtying it by the
emanations from himself.

Far more care is therefore necessary to keep up a constant change of
air in the sick room.

It is hardly necessary to add that there are acute cases,
(particularly a few ophthalmic cases, and diseases where the eye
is morbidly sensitive), where a subdued light is necessary.

But a dark north room is inadmissible even for these. You can always
moderate the light by blinds and curtains.

Heavy, thick, dark window or bed curtains should, however, hardly
ever be used for any kind of sick in this country. A light white curtain
at the head of the bed is, in general, all that is necessary, and
a green blind to the window, to be drawn down only when necessary.

[Sidenote: Without sunlight, we degenerate body and mind.]
One of the greatest observers of human things (not physiological), says,
in another language, "Where there is sun there is thought." All physiology
goes to confirm this.

Where is the shady side of deep valleys, there is cretinism. Where are
cellars and the unsunned sides of narrow streets, there is the degeneracy
and weakliness of the human race--mind and body equally degenerating.
Put the pale withering plant and human being into the sun, and, if not
too far gone, each will recover health and spirit.

[Sidenote: Almost all patients lie with their faces to the light.]
It is a curious thing to observe how almost all patients lie with their
faces turned to the light, exactly as plants always make their
faces turned to the light; a patient will even complain that it
gives him pain "lying on that side."

"Then why _do_ you lie on that side?" He does not know,--but we do. It
is because it is the side towards the window.

A fashionable physician has recently published in a government
report that he always turns his patients' faces from the light.

Yes, but nature is stronger than fashionable physicians, and depend
upon it she turns the faces back and _towards_ such light as
she can get. Walk through the wards of a hospital, remember the bed sides
of private patients you have seen, and count how many sick you ever saw
lying with their faces towards the wall.

X. CLEANLINESS OF ROOMS AND WALLS.

[Sidenote: Cleanliness of carpets and furniture.]
It cannot be necessary to tell a nurse that she should be clean, or that
she should keep her patient clean,--seeing that the greater part of
nursing consists in preserving cleanliness. No ventilation can freshen
a room or ward where the most scrupulous cleanliness is not
observed.
Unless the wind be blowing through the windows at the rate of twenty
miles an hour, dusty carpets, dirty wainscots, musty curtains and
furniture, will infallibly produce a close smell.

I have lived in a large and expensively furnished London house, where
the only constant inmate in two very lofty rooms, with opposite
windows, was myself, and yet, owing to the abovementioned dirty
circumstances, no opening of windows could ever keep those rooms
free from closeness; but the carpet and curtains having been turned
out of the rooms altogether, they became instantly as fresh as could
be wished.

It is pure nonsense to say that in London a room cannot be kept clean.
Many of our hospitals show the exact reverse.

[Sidenote: Dust never removed now.]
But no particle of dust is ever or can ever be removed or really got rid
of by the present system of dusting. Dusting in these days means nothing
but flapping the dust from one part of a room on to another with doors
and windows closed. What you do it for I cannot think. You had much
better leave the dust alone, if you are not going to take it away
altogether. For from the time a room begins to be a room up to the
time when it ceases to be one, no one atom of dust ever actually leaves
its precincts.

Tidying a room means nothing now but removing a thing from one
place, which it has kept clean for itself, on to another and a
dirtier one.[28] Flapping by way of cleaning is only admissible in
the case of pictures, or anything made of paper.

The only way I know to _remove_ dust, the plague of all lovers of fresh
air, is to wipe everything with a damp cloth. And all furniture ought
to be so made as that it may be wiped with a damp cloth without
injury to itself, and so polished as that it may be damped without
injury to others. To dust, as it is now practised, truly means to
distribute dust more equally over a room.

[Sidenote: Floors.]
As to floors, the only really clean floor I know is the Berlin
_lackered_ floor, which is wet rubbed and dry rubbed every morning
to remove the dust. The French _parquet_ is always more or less dusty,
although infinitely superior in point of cleanliness and healthiness
to our absorbent floor.

For a sick room, a carpet is perhaps the worst expedient which could
by any possibility have been invented. If you must have a carpet, the
only safety is to take it up two or three times a year, instead of once.
A dirty carpet literally infects the room.

And if you consider the enormous quantity of organic matter from
the feet of people coming in, which must saturate it, this is by no
means surprising.

[Sidenote: Papered, plastered, oil-painted walls.]
As for walls, the worst is the papered wall; the next worst is plaster.

But the plaster can be redeemed by frequent lime-washing; the paper
requires frequent renewing. A glazed paper gets rid of a good deal
of the danger. But the ordinary bed-room paper is all that it ought
_not_ to be.[29]
The close connection between ventilation and cleanliness is shown in this.
An ordinary light paper will last clean much longer if there is
an Arnott's ventilator in the chimney than it otherwise would.

The best wall now extant is oil paint. From this you can wash the animal
exuviæ.[30]
These are what make a room musty.

[Sidenote: Best kind of wall for a sick-room.]
The best wall for a sick-room or ward that could be made is pure white
non-absorbent cement or glass, or glazed tiles, if they were made sightly
enough.

Air can be soiled just like water. If you blow into water you will soil
it with the animal matter from your breath. So it is with air. Air is
always soiled in a room where walls and carpets are saturated with
animal exhalations.

Want of cleanliness, then, in rooms and wards, which you have to guard
against, may arise in three ways.

[Sidenote: Dirty air from without.] 
1.

Dirty air coming in from without, soiled by sewer emanations, the
evaporation from dirty streets, smoke, bits of unburnt fuel, bits of
straw, bits of horse dung.

I
won't start till I've done a good day's work and I'll come home early."

"What do you want to go gallivantin' to the neighbors for? I never saw
anything like the girls nowadays; highty-tighty, flauntin', traipsin',
triflin' trollops, ev'ry one of 'em, that's what they are, and Ellen
Wilson's one of the triflin'est. You're old enough now to stay to home
where you belong and make an effort to earn your board and clothes,
which you can't, even if you try."

Spunk, real, Simon-pure spunk, started somewhere in Patty and coursed
through her blood like wine.

"If a girl's old enough to stay at home and work, I should think she
was old enough to go out and play once in a while." Patty was still too
timid to make this remark more than a courteous suggestion, so far as
its tone was concerned.

"Don't answer me back; you're full of new tricks, and you've got to stop
'em, right where you are, or there'll be trouble. You were whistlin'
just now up in the barn chamber; that's one of the things I won't have
round my premises,--a whistlin' girl."

"'T was a Sabbath-School hymn that I was whistling!" This with a
creditable imitation of defiance.

"That don't make it any better. Sing your hymns if you must make a noise
while you're workin'."

"It's the same mouth that makes the whistle and sings the song, so I
don't see why one's any wickeder than the other."

"You don't have to see," replied the Deacon grimly; "all you have to do
is to mind when you're spoken to. Now run 'long 'bout your work."

"Can't I go up to Ellen's, then?"

"What's goin' on up there?"

"Just a frolic. There's always a good time at Ellen's, and I would so
like the sight of a big, rich house now and then!"

"'Just a frolic.' Land o' Goshen, hear the girl! 'Sight of a big, rich
house,' indeed!--Will there be any boys at the party?"

"I s'pose so, or 't wouldn't be a frolic," said Patty with awful daring;
"but there won't be many; only a few of Mark's friends."

"Well, there ain't goin' to be no more argyfyin'! I won't have any girl
o' mine frolickin' with boys, so that's the end of it. You're kind
o' crazy lately, riggin' yourself out with a ribbon here and a flower
there, and pullin' your hair down over your ears. Why do you want to
cover your ears up? What are they for?"

"To hear you with, father," Patty replied, with honey-sweet voice and
eyes that blazed.

"Well, I hope they'll never hear anything worse," replied her father,
flinging a bucket of water over the last of the wagon wheels.

"THEY COULDN'T!" These words were never spoken aloud, but oh! how Patty
longed to shout them with a clarion voice as she walked away in perfect
silence, her majestic gait showing, she hoped, how she resented the
outcome of the interview.

"I've stood up to father!" she exclaimed triumphantly as she entered the
kitchen and set down her yellow bowl of eggs on the table. "I stood up
to him, and answered him back three times!"

Waitstill was busy with her Saturday morning cooking, but she turned in
alarm.

"Patty, what have you said and done? are that behind a nurse's back which they would not do before her

brought out the emphatic syllables by a beat of the broken knife on the
