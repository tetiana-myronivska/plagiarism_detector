A RIDE ACROSS PALESTINE

by Anthony Trollope


Circumstances took me to the Holy Land without a companion, and
compelled me to visit Bethany, the Mount of Olives, and the Church
of the Sepulchre alone.  I acknowledge myself to be a gregarious
animal, or, perhaps, rather one of those which nature has intended
to go in pairs.  At nations can scarcely their be unwelcome. With"

this in mind any, but rather in the playful spirit the parodist,
would lief direct faint rays the author has prepared not heart to the
wisdom, of fun to the shrine of heart great for memories.I would then return to the Holy
City, and remaining only long enough to refresh my horse and wipe
the dust from my hands and feet, I would start again for Jaffa, and
there catch a certain Austrian steamer which would take me to Egypt.
Such was my programme, and I confess that I was but ill contented
with it, seeing that I was to be alone during the time.

I had already made all my arrangements, and though I had no reason
for any doubt as to my personal security during the trip, I did not
feel altogether satisfied with them.  I intended to take a French
guide, or dragoman, who had been with me for some days, and to put
myself under the peculiar guardianship of two Bedouin Arabs, who
were to accompany me as long as I should remain east of Jerusalem.
This travelling through the desert under the protection of Bedouins
was, in idea, pleasant enough; and I must here declare that I did
not at all begrudge the forty shillings which I was told by our
British consul that I must pay them for their trouble, in accordance
with the established tariff.  But I did begrudge the fact of the
tariff.  I would rather have fallen in with my friendly Arabs, as it
were by chance, and have rewarded their fidelity at the end of our
joint journeyings by a donation of piastres to be settled by myself,
and which, under such circumstances, would certainly have been as
agreeable to them as the stipulated sum.  In the same way I dislike
having waiters put down in my bill.  I find that I pay them twice
over, and thus lose money; and as they do not expect to be so
treated, I never have the advantage of their civility.  The world, I
fear, is becoming too fond of tariffs.

"A tariff!" said I to the consul, feeling that the whole romance of
my expedition would be dissipated by such an arrangement.  "Then
I'll go alone; I'll take a revolver with me."

"You can't do it, sir," said the consul, in a dry and somewhat angry
tone.  "You have no more right to ride through that country without
paying the regular price for protection, than you have to stop in Z-
's hotel without settling the bill."

I could not contest the point, so I ordered my Bedouins for the
appointed day, exactly as I would send for a ticket-porter at home,
and determined to make the best of it.  The wild unlimited sands,
the desolation of the Dead Sea, the rushing waters of Jordan, the
outlines of the mountains of Moab;--those things the consular tariff
could not alter, nor deprive them of the glories of their
association.

I had submitted, and the arrangements had been made.  Joseph, my
dragoman, was to come to me with the horses and an Arab groom at
five in the morning, and we were to encounter our Bedouins outside
the gate of St. Stephen, down the hill, where the road turns, close
to the tomb of the Virgin.

I was sitting alone in the public room at the hotel, filling my
flask with brandy,--for matters of primary importance I never leave
to servant, dragoman, or guide,--when the waiter entered, and said
that a gentleman wished to speak with me.  The gentleman had not
sent in his card or name; but any gentleman was welcome to me in my
solitude, and I requested that the gentleman might enter.  In
appearance the gentleman certainly was a gentleman, for I thought
that I had never before seen a young man whose looks were more in
his favour, or whose face and gait and outward bearing seemed to
betoken better breeding.  He might be some twenty or twenty-one
years of age, was slight and well made, with very black hair, which
he wore rather long, very dark long bright eyes, a straight nose,
and teeth that were perfectly white.  He was dressed throughout in
grey tweed clothing, having coat, waistcoat, and trousers of the
same; and in his hand he carried a very broad-brimmed straw hat.

"Mr. Jones, I believe," he said, as he bowed to me.  Jones is a good
travelling name, and, if the reader will allow me, I will call
myself Jones on the present occasion.

"Yes," I said, pausing with the brandy-bottle in one hand, and the
flask in the other.  "That's my name; I'm Jones.  Can I do anything
for you, sir?"

"Why, yes, you can," said he.  "My name is Smith,--John Smith."

"Pray sit down, Mr. Smith," I said, pointing to a chair.  "Will you
do anything in this way?" and I proposed to hand the bottle to him.
"As far as I can judge from a short stay, you won't find much like
that in Jerusalem."

He declined the Cognac, however, and immediately began his story.
"I hear, Mr. Jones," said he, "that you are going to Moab to-
morrow."

"Well," I replied, "I don't know whether I shall cross the water.
It's not very easy, I take it, at all times; but I shall certainly
get as far as Jordan.  Can I do anything for you in those parts?"

And then he explained to me what was the object of his visit.  She

has so frequently happened to me that I have had to blush for the
acquaintances whom I have selected, that I seldom indulge in any
close intimacies of this kind.  But, nevertheless, I was taken with
John Smith, in spite of his name.  There was so much about him that
was pleasant, both to the eye and to the understanding!  One meets
constantly with men from contact with whom one revolts without
knowing the cause of such dislike.  The cut of their beard is
displeasing, or the mode in which they walk or speak.  But, on the
other hand, there are men who are attractive, and I must confess
that I was attracted by John Smith at first sight.  I hesitated,
however, for a minute; for there are sundry things of which it
behoves a traveller to think before he can join a companion for such
a journey as that which I was about to make.  Could the young man
rise early, and remain in the saddle for ten hours together?  Could
he live upon hard-boiled eggs and brandy-and-water?  Could he take
his chance of a tent under which to sleep, and make himself happy
with the bare fact of being in the desert?  He saw my hesitation,
and attributed it to a cause which was not present in my mind at the
moment, though the subject was one of the greatest importance when
strangers consent to join themselves together for a time, and agree
to become no strangers on the spur of the moment.
