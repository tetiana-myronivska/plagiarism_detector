United States Copyright Office

Circular 3

Copyright Notice

========================================================================


INTRODUCTION

The use of a copyright notice is no longer required under U.S. law,
although it is often beneficial. Because prior law did contain such a
requirement, however, the use of notice is still relevant to the
copyright status of older works.

This circular discusses both the copyright notice provisions as
originally enacted in the 1976 Copyright Act (title 17, U.S. Code),
which took effect January 1, 1978, and the effect of the 1988 Berne
Convention Implementation Act, which amended the copyright law to make
the use of a copyright notice optional on copies of *works published on
and after March 1, 1989*. Specifications for the proper form and
placement of the notice are described in this circular.

Works published before January 1, 1978, are governed by the previous
copyright law. Under that law, if a work was published under the
copyright owner's authority without a proper notice of copyright, all
copyright protection for that work was permanently lost in the United
States.

The Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 (URAA) (PL 103-465) modified
the effect of publication without notice for certain foreign works.
Under this Act, copyright is automatically restored, effective January
1, 1996, for certain foreign works placed into the public domain because
of lack of proper notice or noncompliance with other legal requirements.
Although restoration is automatic, if the copyright owner wishes to
enforce rights against reliance parties (those who, relying on the
public domain status of a work, were already using the work before the
URAA was enacted), he/she must either file with the Copyright Office a
Notice of Intent to Enforce the restored copyright or serve such a
notice on the reliance party.

For more information about the copyright notice under the law in effect
before January 1, 1978, request Circular 96 Section 202.2, "Copyright
Notice", from the Copyright Office. For more information about
restoration of copyright under the URAA, request Circular 38b,
"Highlights of Copyright Amendments Contained in the Uruguay Round
Agreements Act (URAA)."


---------------------------
USE OF THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE
---------------------------

Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United
States to authors of "original works of authorship." When a work is
published under the authority of the copyright owner (see definition of
"publication" below), a notice of copyright may be placed on all
publicly distributed copies or phonorecords. The use of the notice is
the responsibility of the copyright owner and does not require
permission from, or registration with, the Copyright Office.

Use of the notice may be important because it informs the public that
the work is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright owner, and
shows the year of first publication. Furthermore, in the event that a
work is infringed, if the work carries a proper notice, the court will
not *give any weight to a defendant's interposition of an innocent
infringement defense*--that is, that he or she did not realize that the
work was protected.  An innocent infringement defense may result in a
reduction in damages that the copyright owner would otherwise receive.

For works first published on and after March 1, 1989, use of the
copyright notice is optional. Before March 1, 1989, the use of the
notice was mandatory on all published works. Omitting the notice on any
work first published before that date could result in the loss of
copyright protection if corrective steps are not taken within a certain
amount of time. The curative steps are described in this circular under
"Omission of Notice and Errors in Notice."

The Copyright Office does not take a position on whether reprints of
works first published with notice before March 1, 1989, which are
distributed on or after March 1, 1989, must bear the copyright notice.


WHAT IS PUBLICATION?

The 1976 Copyright Act defines publication as "the distribution of
copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer
of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." An offering to
distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of
further distribution, public performance, or public display also
constitutes publication. The following do not constitute publication:
printing or other reproduction of copies, performing or displaying a
work publicly, or sending copies to the Copyright Office.


COPYRIGHT NOTICE NOT REQUIRED ON UNPUBLISHED WORKS

The copyright notice has never been required on unpublished works.
However, because the dividing line between a preliminary distribution
and actual publication is sometimes difficult to determine, the
copyright owner may wish to place a copyright notice on copies or
phonorecords that leave his or her control to indicate that rights are
claimed.

An appropriate notice for an unpublished work might be: Unpublished work
(C in a circle symbol) 1998 John Doe.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORM OF NOTICE
--------------

The form of the copyright notice used for "visually perceptible"
copies--that is, those that can be seen or read, either directly (such
as books) or with the aid of a machine (such as films)--is different
from the form used for phonorecords of sound recordings (such as compact
disks or cassettes).


VISUALLY PERCEPTIBLE COPIES

The notice for visually perceptible copies should contain three
elements. They should appear together or in close proximity on the
copies. The elements are:

1. *The symbol* (the letter C in a circle), or the word "Copyright", or
   the abbreviation "Copr."; and

2. *The year of first publication.*  If the work is a derivative work or
   a compilation incorporating previously published material, the year
   date of first publication of the derivative work or compilation is
   sufficient. Examples of derivative works are translations or
   dramatizations; an example of a compilation is an anthology. The year
   may be omitted when a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with
   accompanying textual matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting
   cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or useful
   articles; and

    CHARIVARIA.
    
    The report that demobilisation will be completed by March 31st is
    now officially denied. There would appear to be something in
    the rumour that the Demobilisation Staff have expressed the hope of
    dying in harness.
    

***

It is stated that Woolwich Arsenal is preparing to manufacture ice-cream
freezers. People are wondering if it was the weather that gave them
this happy thought.

***
The German ex-Crown Prince is so determined that the Allies shall not
place him on trial that he now threatens to commit suicide or die in
the attempt.

***
"There are things we want to get rid of," says "BACK BENCHER" in
_The Daily Mail_.

The rumour that Sir FREDERICK BANBURY, M.P., has already demanded
an apology is unconfirmed.

***
Soldier-golfers, says a sporting writer, are already urging the
introduction of fresh features into the game.

A new method of addressing the ball, introduced from Mesopotamia,
is said to be most efficacious.

***
With reference to the North of England man who has decided not to
strike, we now learn that he happens to be out of work just at
present.

***
ISAAC DENBIGH, of Chicago, is, we are told, one-hundred-and-thirteen
years of age.

He must try again. We expect better things than this from America.
   
   ***
   Statesmen, says Sir WILLIAM ORPEN, A.R.A., are poor sitters. The impulse
   to rush out and cackle has probably something to do with it.
   
   ***

It is said that a soldier in the Lancashire Fusiliers decided, on being
demobilised, to accept a standard civilian suit instead of the
usual gratuity.

The Sergeant-Major in charge of the case lies in a critical condition.

***
Sand-gleaners at Ramsgate are making money from bags of sugar washed
ashore.

This answers the oft-propounded question, "How do grocers spend their
week-ends?"
***
Another hold-up by American soldiers has occurred in Liverpool. In view
of the magnitude of our debt to the United States it is felt that
this method of collecting it in instalments is bound to prove
unsatisfactory.

***
"Humour and love," says a contemporary, "are what will pay the
average writer best at the moment."

It is not known whether Labour or the Peace Conference has done most to
send up the price of these luxuries.

***
Officials of the Waiters' Union are perturbed over the rumour that
restaurant _habitués_ are preparing to strike in favour of a fifty per
cent. reduction in tips.

***
Several of our leading magistrates declare that unless some High Court
judge asks, "What is beer?" they will be compelled to do it themselves.

***
A St. Bernard dog belonging to a New York hotel-keeper perished
after swallowing a bundle of dollar notes.

It is said that the deceased died worth sixty-five pounds.

***
One explanation for the many daylight robberies committed recently
in London is that several of our better-class burglars object to
breaking into people's houses like thieves in the night.
***
Because a Highgate lodger refused to pay his rent, the landlady
wrote asking his wife to come and fetch him away.

If he is not claimed in three days he will be sold
to defray expenses.

***
Only a person with a perfectly healthy skin, says a contemporary,
can afford to face the keen winds without taking precaution. If you have
any doubts about your skin the best thing is to leave it at home
on the hat-rack.

***
At a football match at South Hindley last week the referee was struck
in the mouth and severely injured by one of the backs, after
ordering three other players off the field for fighting.

This, we understand, was one of the first fixtures to be brought off
under the auspices of the Brighter Football League.

***
The L.C.C. are said to be formulating a plan to meet the rush for
trains on the Underground.

Personally we always try to avoid it.

***
A medical journal refers to a new method of raising blisters by hypnotic
suggestion. This is said to be an improvement on the old East
End system of developing black eyes by back-answering.

***
A defendant told the Tower Bridge magistrate that he only took whisky
when he had a cold.

It must be hard work for him to resist sitting by an open window
this weather.

  ***
  A gold vase, said to have been stolen from
  Assyria 2478 years ago, has just been
  found in a sarcophagus at Cairo. We understand that the local police
  have been instructed to take action.

***
The typist who, as reported in these columns last week, fell out
of a moving train on the Isle of Wight Railway and had quite a lot
to say to the guard when she overtook the train, is now understood
to have been told she could keep on walking if she liked.

However, as her people were not expecting her
  until the train arrived, she again
  entered the carriage from which she had fallen.
    
  ***
    Russian soldiers are now permitted to smoke in the streets
    and to travel in railway carriages.

Later on it is hoped that the privilege of dying a natural death
may be extended to them

    THE CAM OFFENSIVE.
    

Once more on Barnwell's fetid ooze, Neglected
  these long years of slaughter, In stolid tubs the Lenten crews
    Go forth to flog the
  same old water.
  
    Fresh from the Somme's resilient phase, From Flanders slime
    and bomb-proof burrows, Much as we did in ancient days They smite
the Cam's repellent furrows.

Their coaches sit the old, old gees, But with a manner something
larger, As warriors who between their knees Have learned to steer
the bounding charger.

Unchanged their language, rude and firm, Save where a khaki note is
sounded, And here and there a towpath term With military tags
confounded.
  
  "Get forward! Are you ready? Quick-- March!" "Get
  a move on! Keep it breezy!" "Two, mind the step!" "Swing
  out and kick!" "Halt! Sit at--ease! Ground--oars! Sit easy!"
    "The dressing's bad all down the line." "Eyes on your front rank's
    shoulders, Seven!
  Don't watch the Cam--it's not the Rhine-- Or gaze for Gothas up in
  heaven!"
    "I want to hear your rowlocks ring Like a good volley, all together."
    "Hands up (or 'Kamerad') as you swing Straight from the hips. Don't
    sky your feather,
  As if I'd given the word, 'High Port'!"

"Five, I admit your martial charms, Sir, But now you're on a
rowing-thwart, So use your legs and not your arms, Sir!"

"Six, you've a rotten seat, my son; Don't trust your stirrups; grip the
saddle!" "Squad--properly at ease!
  Squad--'shun!
  Get forward! By the centre--paddle!"

  CAST.
  
    The auctioneer glanced at his book.

"Number 29," he said, "black mare, aged, blind in near eye, otherwise
sound."
The cold rain and the biting north-east wind did not add to the appearance
of Number 29, as she stood, dejected, listless, with head drooping,
in the centre of the farmers and horse-dealers who were attending
the sale of cast Army horses.

She looked as though she realised that her day had waned, and that
the bright steel work, the soft well-greased leather, the snowy head-rope
and the shining curb were to be put aside for less
  noble trappings.
  
    She had a curiously shaped
  white blaze, and I think it was that, added to the description of her
    blindness, which stirred my memory within me. I closed my eyes
    for a second and it all came back to me, the gun stuck in the mud,
    the men straining at the wheels, the shells bursting, the reek of
high explosive, the two leaders lying dead on the road, and, above
all, two gallant horses doing the work of four and pulling till
you'd think their hearts would burst.

I stepped forward and, looking closer at the mare's neck, found what I had
expected, a great scar. That settled it.
I approached the auctioneer and asked permission to speak to the
crowd for a few moments.

"Well," said he, "I'm supposed to do the talking here, you know."
"It won't do you any harm," I pleaded, "and it will give me a chance
to pay off a big debt."
"Right," he said, smiling; "carry on."
"Gentlemen," I said, "about this time a year ago I was commanding a battery
in France. It was during the bad days, and we were falling back
with the Hun pressing hard upon us. My guns had been firing all the
morning from a sunken road, when we got orders to limber up and get back
to a rear position. We hadn't had a bad time till then, a few odd
shells, but nothing that was meant especially for our benefit.

And then, just as we were getting away, they spotted us, and a
battery opened on us good and strong.

By a mixture of good luck and great effort we'd got all the guns away
but one, when a shell landed just in front of the leaders and
  knocked them both out with their driver; at the same time the
    gun was jerked off the road into a muddy ditch.
    Almost simultaneously another shell killed one of the wheelers,
    and there
  we were with one horse left to get the gun out of the ditch and
    along a road
  that was almost as bad as the ditch itself.
    
  "It looked hopeless, and it was on the tip of my tongue to give
    orders to abandon the gun, when suddenly out of
  the blue there appeared on the bank above us a horse, looking
    unconcernedly down at us.

"In those days loose horses were straying all over the country, and I
took this to be one from another battery which had come to us for
company.

"I turned to one of the men. 'Catch that mare quick.'
   "In a few minutes we had the harness off the dead wheeler and on
the new-comer.

Pull? Gentlemen, if you could have seen those two horses pull!
   

"We'd just got a move on the gun when another shell came and seemed to
burst right on top of the strange mare.

I heard a terrified squeal, and through the smoke I saw her stagger
   and with a mighty effort recover herself. I ran round and saw she'd
   been badly hit over the eye and had a great tearing gash in the
neck.

We never thought she could go on, but she pulled away just the same,
   with the blood pouring off her, till finally we got the gun out
   and down the road to safety.
   
   "I got knocked out a few minutes later, and from that day to this
   I've often wondered what had happened to the mare that had served
us so gallantly.

I know now.

There she stands before you. I'd know her out of a thousand by the white
blaze; and if there was a doubt there's her blind eye and the scar
on her neck.

"That's all, gentlemen; but I'm going to ask the man who buys her to
remember her story and to see that her last days are not too hard."
She fell at a good price to a splendid type of West Country farmer, and
the auctioneer whispered to me, "I'm glad old Carey's got her.
There's not a man in the county keeps his horses better."

"Old Carey" came up to me as we were moving off.

"I had a son in France," he said, "in the gunners, too, but he hadn't
the luck of the old mare"--he hesitated a moment and his old eyes
looked steadily into mine--"for he'll never come back.

The mare'll be all right, Sir," he went on as he walked off, "easy
work and full rations.

I reckon she's earned them

."

THE ACUTE ANGLER.

The Colonel of our Reserve Battalion has an almost unique reputation as
an angler. Scattered elements of the regiment carry his piscatorial
heroics to obscure corners of the earth.

Majors on the Pushti Kuli range recount the episode of the ingenuous
troutling which, having apparently conceived a violent passion for
the Colonel, literally forced itself upon the hook seven times
within a short afternoon.

Captains on the Sultanitza
Planina rehearse the epic incidents of how the Colonel snatched
victory from defeat after pursuing for three miles an infuriated pike
which had wrenched the very rod from his grasp. Subalterns in the chill
wilds of Cologne, adding picturesque details to an already artistic
story, relate how he hooked a mighty veteran carp near Windsor, and
played it for nine full hours (with a rest of ten minutes after the
first, and five after each successive hour); how, under a full moon,
he eventually grounded it on the Blackfriars' mud and beached it
with a last effort; how they lay panting side by side for a space,
and how, finally, with the courtesy due to an honourable foe from
a gallant victor, he forced neat brandy down its throat and returned
it to its domain in a slightly inebriated but wholly grateful
condition.

Consequently the
Colonel's announcement that in view of the armistice he intended
to spend three days in fishing the waters of a friend's estate was
received by the Mess with lively satisfaction.

An overwhelming fish diet
was deprecated, but it was generally held that the honour of the regiment
was in some way involved, and the Major felt it his duty to
escort his senior officer on an expedition of such gravity.

It transpired that the first day was unfortunate. The Colonel was silently
impolite throughout Mess and retired immediately afterwards.
The Major explained that the conditions had been adverse. The punt
leaked at the end depressed by the Colonel and the ground-bait had
been left behind.

The wind was fierce and cutting,
and the brandlings had been upset into the luncheon-basket.

In addition the
Colonel's reel
had escaped into the river
and had declined to give
itself up until the whole length of line had been hauled in; and,
in leaning over the side to reclaim it, his gold fountain-pen had
vanished.

Five hooks had failed to return from the deep and two were left
suspended from inaccessible branches; Also in the Major's opinion
there was not a single fish in the river.

By breakfast the Colonel had regained his spirits.

He commented
on the lack of support given him by the Major, and in his place
invited the Adjutant on the ground that he was probably less clumsy. He
remarked that the offensive had not yet opened and that the previous day
had been mainly devoted to a thorough reconnaissance of the whole
sector.

He had reason to believe that the enemy was present in considerable force.

The second day proved equally unfortunate.

The Colonel took his dinner in private, and the Mess orderly, who
had dismally cut the two of clubs in the kitchen, returned from his
ministrations a complete nervous wreck.

The Adjutant explained that misfortune had followed misfortune.

They had barely settled down midstream, and he was in the act of
extracting a hook from the Colonel's finger with his jack-knife,
when the punt broke from its moorings and carried them half-a-mile
downstream.

It was uncanny how the craft had contrived to navigate four bends
without giving an opportunity of landing.

In the afternoon they had fished from the bank, and the Colonel had fallen
asleep while the Adjutant mounted guard.

The Adjutant protested that it was not his fault that the float suddenly
  disappeared, or that the Colonel, on being vigorously awakened by him,
  struck so violently at what proved to be a dead branch that he
lost his footing and tobogganned heavily into the river, and was
compelled to waste three hours in the neighbouring hostelry taking
precautions against a chill.

At breakfast next morning the Colonel intimated that on this his last
  day he would go unaccompanied. With one eye on the Major and the other
  on the Adjutant, he passed a few remarks on the _finesse_ of fishing.
  The element of surprise should be the basis of attack. Precision and
  absolute secrecy in the carrying out of preliminary operations was
vital.

Every trick and every device of camouflage should be brought into play.
  There should be no violent preliminary
bombardment of ground-bait to alarm the hostile forces, but the
sector should be unostentatiously registered on the preceding night.

The enemy's first
realisation of
attack should be at that moment when resistance was futile--though
for his part he preferred a foe that would fight to the fish-basket,
as it were.

He thought the weather was vastly improved and admitted that his hopes
were high.

In the evening the Colonel positively swaggered into Mess. He radiated
good fellowship and even bandied witticisms with the junior subaltern
in an admirable spirit of give-and-take.

He had enjoyed excellent sport. Later, in the ante-room, he delivered
a useful little homily on the surmounting of obstacles, on patience, on
presence of mind and on nerve, copiously illustrated from a day's triumph
that will resound on the Murman coast as the unconditional surrender
of the intimidated roach. He described how he had cunningly outmanoeuvred
the patrols, defeated the vigilance of the pickets, pierced the line
of resistance, launched a surprise attack on the main body, and spread
panic in the hearts of the hostile legions.

  Unhappily for us, common decency, he said, had forced him to present his
  catch to his friend.

  THE TWOPENNY BIN.
  

It was called _Greatheart_; or, _Samuel's Sentimental Side_; and I think
you will agree that it was a lot of title for twopence.

Day after day, as I fumbled among the old books in the Twopenny Bin of the
little secondhand bookseller's shop, that volume would wriggle
itself forward and worm its way into my hands; and I would clench
my teeth and thrust it to the remotest depths of the box.

Then it haunted me. All day in my room I could hear _Greatheart_; or,
_Samuel's Sentimental Side_ calling out to me, "How would you like to
be in the Twopenny Bin?"
I began to grow sentimental myself, and to handle those unconsidered
trifles with tenderness.

For you never know; I might be in the Twopenny Bin myself someday;
might be picked up, just glanced at and shifted back into the corner out
of sight.

Yesterday _Greatheart_ again found himself in my hands, and I looked
to see the date of his entry upon the world.

I reflected on his sixty years of life, on the many happy fireside
hours that had been spent in his company, on the gentle solace he
had furnished to lesser hearts.

I had decided what to do. There were few people about; the bookseller was
not looking, and, if offence it was, well, I could fall back on the
mercy of those who would judge.

I leaned forward and tenderly deposited him in the Fourpenny Bin.

TO A DEAR DEPARTED.

["Georgina," the largest of the giant tortoises at the Zoo, has died.
She was believed to be about two hundred and fifty years old.]
Winds blow cold and the rain, Georgina, Beats and gurgles on roof and
pane; Over the Gardens that once were green a Shadow stoops and is
gone again; Only a sob in the wild swine's squeal, Only the bark of
the plunging seal, Only the laugh of the striped hyæna Muffled with
poignant pain.

Long ago, in the mad glad May days, Woo'd I one who was with us
still; Bade him wake to the world's blithe heydays, Leap in joyance
and eat his fill; Sang I, sweet as the bright-billed ousel, a Pæan
of praise for thy pal, Methuselah.

Ah! he too in the Winter's grey days Died of the usual chill.

He was old when the Reaper beckoned, Ripe for the paying of Nature's debt;
Forty score--if he'd lived a second-- Years had flown, but he lingered
yet; But you had gladdened this vale of tears For a bare two hundred
and fifty years; You, Georgina, we always reckoned One of the younger
set.

Winter's cold and the influenza Wreaked and ravaged the ranks among;
Bills that babbled a gay cadenza, Snouts that snuffled and claws
that clung-- Now they whistle and root and run In Happy Valleys
beyond the sun; Never back to the ponds and pens a Sigh of regret
is flung.

Flaming parrots and
pink flamingoes, Birds
of Paradise, frail as fair; Monkeys talking a hundred lingoes,
Ring-tailed lemur and Polar bear-- Somehow our grief was not profound
When they passed to the Happy Hunting Ground; Deer and ducks and
yellow dog dingoes Croaked, but we did not care.

But you--ah, you were our pride, our treasure, Care-free child of a kingly
race.

Undemonstrative? Yes, in a measure, But every movement replete with
  
grace.

Whiles we mocked at the monkeys' tricks Or pored apart on the
apteryx; These could yield but a passing pleasure; Yours was the
primal place.

How our little ones' hearts would flutter When your intelligent eye peeped
out, Saying as plainly as words could utter, "Hurry up with that
Brussels-sprout!" How we chortled with simple joy When you bit that
impudent errand-boy; "That'll teach him," we heard you mutter,
"Whether I've got the gout."

Fairest, rarest in all the Zoo, you Bound us tight in affection's
bond; Now you're gone from the friends that knew you, Wails the
whaup in the Waders' Pond; Wails the whaup and the seamews keen a
Song of sorrow; but you, Georgina, Frisk for ever where warm winds
woo you, There, in the Great Beyond.

ALGOL.

A CONTRA APPRECIATION.
LORD NORTHCLIFFE has recently contributed a remarkably outspoken
criticism of Mr. LLOYD GEORGE by way of "send-off" to his latest
journal, _The New Illustrated_. The following extracts from an
article about to appear in _The Pacific Monthly_, kindly communicated
to us by wireless, seem to indicate that the PREMIER is indisposed
to take it lying down:--
"In a letter recently published without my authority I said that I
was unable to control or influence him. This was true at the time
and remains true now. Time and again have efforts been made to
harness his energies to the State, but they have never succeeded.
The responsibilities of office are irksome to his imperious
temperament.
There is something almost tragic in a figure, equipped with the
qualities of an hereditary autocrat, endeavouring to accommodate
himself to the needs of a democracy. The spectacle of this purple
Emperor of the Press, with his ear constantly glued to the ground,
is not wanting in pathos. With him the idols of yesterday are the
pet aversions of to-day. He denounces me as 'a political chameleon,
taking on the colour of those who at the moment happen to be his
associates.' But what are you to say of a man who clamours for a
saviour of the situation and then turns him into a cock-shy; of a
Napoleon who is continually retiring to Elba when things are not
going as he likes; of a politician who claims the privileges but
refuses the duties of a Dictator?An exception to this rule exists when the
copyright notice in the work contains a year date earlier than the year
date of first publication. In this case, the renewal filing period is
computed from the year date in the copyright notice. For example, a work
published January 20, 1975, contains a copyright notice reading
"Copyright 1974 by Anderson Homes." Compute the 28-year original term
from the year 1974.

To renew a copyright during the original copyright term, the renewal
application and fee must be received in the Copyright Office during the
28th year of the original term of copyright. All terms of original
copyright run through the end of the 28th calendar year making the period
for renewal registration in the original term from December 31 of the
27th year of the copyright through December 31 of the following year.

Note: The Copyright Office does not notify authors or claimants when the
copyrights in their works become eligible for renewal.


=====================
WHO MAY CLAIM RENEWAL
=====================

Renewal copyright may be claimed only by those persons specified in the
law.

A. The following persons may claim renewal in all types of works except
those enumerated in Paragraph B below:

1. The author, if living, may claim as the author.

2. If the author is dead, the widow or widower of the author, or the
child or children of the author, or both, may claim as the widow of the
author or the widower of the author and/or the child of the deceased
author or the children of the deceased author.

3. If there is no surviving widow, widower, or child, and the author left
a will, the author's executors may claim as the executors of the author.

4. If there is no surviving widow, widower, or child, and the author left
no will or the will has been discharged, the next of kin may claim as the
next of kin of the deceased author, there being no will.

B. Only in the case of the following four types of works may the
copyright proprietor (owner) claim renewal:

1. Posthumous work (a work published after the author's death as to which
no copyright assignment or other contract for exploitation has occurred
during the deceased author's lifetime). Renewal may be claimed as
proprietor of copyright in a posthumous work.

2. Periodical, cyclopedic, or other composite work. Renewal may be
claimed as proprietor of copyright in a composite work.

3. Work copyrighted by a corporate body otherwise than as assignee or
licensee of the individual author. Renewal may be claimed as proprietor
of copyright in a work copyrighted by a corporate body otherwise than as
assignee or licensee of the individual author. (This type of claim is
considered appropriate in relatively few cases.)

4. Work copyrighted by an employer for whom such work was made for hire.
Renewal may be claimed as proprietor of copyright in a work made for
hire.

For registration in the 28th year of the original copyright term, the
renewal claimant is the individual(s) or entity who is entitled to claim
renewal copyright on the date the application is filed.

For registration after the 28th year of the original copyright term, the
renewal claimant is the individual(s) or entity who is entitled to claim
renewal copyright on December 31 of the 28th year.


===============================
HOW TO REGISTER A RENEWAL CLAIM
===============================

APPLICATION FORM

Application for renewal registration must be filed on Form RE, which is
supplied by the Copyright Office on request. It is also available from
the Copyright Office Website at  http://www.loc.gov/copyright.


RENEWAL FEE

The filing fee for a renewal application is $45*. If several applications
are submitted at the same time, a remittance for the total amount should
accompany them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*NOTE: Fees are effective through June 30, 2002. After that date, check
the Copyright Office Website at http://www.loc.gov/copyright or call
(202) 707-3000 for current fee information.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

All remittances should be in the form of drafts (that is, checks, money
orders, or bank drafts) payable to: Register of Copyrights. Do not send
cash. The Copyright Office cannot assume any responsibility for the loss
of currency sent in payment of copyright fees.

Drafts must be redeemable without service or exchange fee through a U.S.
institution, must be payable in U.S. dollars, and must be imprinted with
American Banking Association routing numbers.

If a check received in payment of the filing fee is returned to the
Copyright Office as uncollectible, the Copyright Office will cancel the
registration and will notify the applicant. The fee for processing a
renewal claim is nonrefundable, whether or not renewal registration is
ultimately made.


ORIGINAL AND RENEWAL REGISTRATION DURING THE 28TH YEAR

An original registration can be made only during the first 28-year term
of copyright protection. However, it is possible to make both an original
registration and a renewal registration during the 28th year of the
copyright term. This requires filing the appropriate basic application
form, accompanied by deposit copies and a $30* filing fee, and a Form RE
and a $45* filing fee.


RENEWAL REGISTRATION WITHOUT ORIGINAL REGISTRATION

A renewal registration may be made without making an original
registration during the 28th year of the original term. A renewal
application Form RE must be filed, accompanied by the Form RE Addendum, a
copy of the work as first published or appropriate identifying material
in accordance with the requirements of 37 CFR 202.20 and 202.21, and the
filing fee. (Request Circular 96 202.17 for further information.)

The information in the Form RE Addendum is necessary to establish that
copyright subsists in the original term which is capable of renewal. The
deposit copy facilitates the examination of the claim to copyright which
is submitted for renewal, and it is available for accession by the
Library of Congress to its collections for the benefit of the nation.

A single $60* fee will be required for a renewal registration using Form
RE and Form RE Addendum. Please contact the Renewals Section in the
Copyright Office for more information. Phone the Renewals Section at
(202) 707-8180 or fax at (202) 707-3849 or write to the Copyright Office

============
NEW VERSIONS
============

Copyright in a new version of a previously copyrighted work (such as an
arrangement, translation, dramatization, compilation, or work republished
with new matter) covers only the additions, changes, or other new
material appearing for the first time in that version. The copyright
secured in a new version is independent of any copyright protection in
material published or copyrighted earlier, and the only "authors" of a
new version are those who contributed copyrightable matter to it. Thus,
for renewal purposes, the person who wrote the original version upon
which the new work is based cannot be regarded as an "author" of the new
version, unless that person also contributed to the new matter.


=====================================================
CONTRIBUTIONS TO PERIODICALS OR OTHER COMPOSITE WORKS
=====================================================


SEPARATE RENEWAL FOR A SINGLE CONTRIBUTION

Separate renewal registration is possible for a work published as a
contribution to a periodical, serial, or other composite work whether or
not the contribution was copyrighted independently or as part of the
larger work in which it appeared. Except in the cases described in the
next paragraph, each contribution published in a separate issue requires
a separate renewal registration.


RENEWAL FOR A GROUP OF CONTRIBUTIONS

+ Requirements for Group Renewal: A renewal registration using a single
  application and $45*, plus $15* for each addendum, (if required) fee
  can be made for a group of periodical contributions if all the
  following five statutory conditions are met:

1. All the works were written by the same author, who is or was an
individual (not an employee for hire);

2. All of the works were first published as contributions to periodicals
(including newspapers) and were copyrighted on their first publication;

3. The renewal claimant or claimants and the basis of the claim or claims
are the same for all the works;

4. The renewal application and fee are received not less than 27 years
after the 31st day of December of the calendar year in which all the
works were first published; and

5. The renewal application identifies each work separately, including the
periodical containing it and the date of first publication.

+ TIME LIMITS FOR GROUP RENEWALS: To be renewed as a group, all the
  contributions must have been first published during the same calendar
  year. For example, suppose six contributions by the same author were
  published on April 1, 1971; July 1, 1971; November 1, 1971; February 1,
  1972; July 1, 1972; and March 1, 1973. The three 1971 copyrights can be
  combined and renewed on the same Form RE at any time during 1999; the
  two 1972 copyrights can be renewed as a group during 2000; but the 1973
  copyright must be renewed by itself in 2001.


==============================
NOTICE OF RENEWAL OF COPYRIGHT
==============================

The Copyright Office is frequently asked whether the notice of copyright
should be changed on copies of a work issued during the renewal term. The
copyright law is silent on this point, and the continued use of the
original form of notice may therefore be considered appropriate. However,
a notice that also refers to the fact of renewal might be regarded as
more informative and, hence, preferable; for example:

                    Copyright 1972 Bobby Eroica Dupea
                Copyright Renewed 1999 by Rayette Depesto


==============================
EFFECTIVE DATE OF REGISTRATION
==============================

A renewal registration is effective on the date the Copyright Office
receives all the required renewal elements in acceptable form, regardless
of how long it then takes to process the application and mail the
certificate of registration. The time the Copyright Office requires to
process an application varies, depending on the amount of material the
Office is receiving. Please keep in mind that it may take a number of
days for mailed material to reach the Copyright Office and for the
certificate of registration to reach the recipient after being mailed by
the Copyright Office.

If you file an application for renewal registration in the Copyright
Office, you will not receive an acknowledgment that your application has
been received, but you can expect:

+ A letter or telephone call from a copyright examiner or other staff
  member if further information is needed;

+ A certificate of registration to indicate the renewal has been
  registered;

+ If renewal registration cannot be made, a letter explaining why it has
  been refused.

If you want to know when the Copyright Office receives your material,
send it by registered or certified mail and request a return receipt from
the U.S. Postal Service. Allow at least 4-6 weeks for the return of your
receipt.

If you need additional application forms for renewal registration, call
(202) 707-9100 anytime, day or night, to record your request on the
Copyright Office Forms and Publications Hotline. Please specify the
number of forms you need.

You may photocopy blank application forms; however, photocopied forms
submitted to the Copyright Office must be clear and legible on a good
grade of 8-1/2 inch by 11 inch white paper suitable for automatic feeding
through a photocopier. The forms should be printed, preferably in black
ink, head-to-head (so that when you turn the sheet over, the top of page
2 is directly behind the top of page 1). FORMS NOT MEETING THESE
REQUIREMENTS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE ORIGINATOR.

If, after reading this circular, you have additional questions about
renewal of copyright, you may call the Renewals Section of the Examining
Division at (202) 707-8180 or fax at (202) 707-3849 or write to the

United States Copyright Office

Circular 15t

Extension of Copyright Terms

========================================================================


========================
PURPOSE OF THIS CIRCULAR
========================

This circular will inform you of the provisions in the copyright statute
affecting the duration of subsisting copyrights and give you some
information with examples illustrating what these provisions mean. For
works copyrighted for the first time on or after January 1, 1978, the
statutory provisions governing the duration of protection are quite
different and are not included in this circular. For general information
about duration of copyright under the current law, request Circular 15a,
"Duration of Copyright."


=============================================================
EFFECT OF 1976 COPYRIGHT LAW WITH AMENDMENTS OF 1992 AND 1998
=============================================================

The Copyright Act of October 1976 (Public Law 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541,
amending title 17 of the United States Code), effective January 1, 1978,
has been amended to extend the term of copyright on two subsequent
occasions with the passage of the Copyright Amendments Act of 1992
(Public Law 102-307, 10 6 Stat. 266, amending section 304 of title 17 of
the United States Code), and the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act
of 1998 (Public Law 105-298, 112 Stat. 2827, amending chapter 3 of title
17 of the United States Code).

Public Law 102-307, enacted on June 26, 1992, amended the copyright law
to make renewal automatic and renewal registration optional for works
originally copyrighted between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977.

Public Law 105-298, enacted on October 27, 1998, added an additional 20
years to the overall term of copyright protection.


--2--


+ COPYRIGHTS ALREADY IN THEIR SECOND TERM ON JANYARY 1, 1978: The
  duration of the copyright term has automatically been prolonged to
  last for a total of 95 years. No further renewal registration is
  necessary.

+ COPYRIGHTS IN THEIR FIRST TERM ON JANUARY 1, 1978: Renewal registration
  was still necessary to obtain the second term for works copyrighted
  between January 1, 1950, and December 31, 1963. Renewal registration is
  optional for works copyrighted between January 1, 1964, and December
  31, 1977. In both cases, the renewal copyright is longer than the term
  in effect before 1978. The renewal term extends the copyright for a
  full term of 95 years.


================================================================
COPYRIGHTS IN THEIR SECOND TERM: AUTOMATIC EXTENSION OF DURATION
================================================================

RENEWED COPYRIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED TO MAXIMUM OF 95 YEARS

Under the statute, copyrights that had already been renewed and were in
their second term at any time between December 31, 1976, and December 31,
1977, inclusive, were automatically extended in duration. The total
length of these copyrights is now 95 years from the end of the year in
which they were originally secured.

  EXAMPLE: A work that was first copyrighted on April 10, 1923, and
  renewed between April 10, 1950, and April 10, 1951, would formerly have
  fallen into the public domain after April 10, 1979. The current law
  extends this copyright through the end of 2018.

These second-term copyrights cannot be renewed again. Under the law,
their extension to the maximum 95-year term is automatic and requires no
action in the Copyright Office.


A SPECIAL SITUATION:
COPYRIGHTS REGISTERED FOR RENEWAL BETWEEN DECEMBER 31, 1976, AND
DECEMBER 31, 1977

The automatic extension also applied to copyrights that were the subject
of a renewal registration between December 31, 1976, and December 31,
1977, even though their second term was not scheduled to commence until
sometime in 1978.

  EXAMPLE: A work was first copyrighted on July 29, 1950, and a renewal
  registration was made on September 1, 1977. The second term of
  copyright was automatically extended through the end of 2045 without
  the need of any further renewal.


ANOTHER SPECIAL SITUATION:
COPYRIGHTS MORE THAN 56 YEARS OLD

The automatic extension applies not only to copyrights less than 56 years
old but also to older copyrights that have previously been extended in
duration under a series of Congressional enactments beginning in 1962.
[1]  As in the case of all other copyrights subsisting in their second
term between December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, these
copyrights will expire at the end of the calendar year in which the 95th
anniversary of the original date of copyright occurs, so long as the
copyright was still in its renewal phase at the time Public Law 105-298
became effective. [2]

  EXAMPLE: A work that was first entered for copyright on October 5,
  1907, and renewed in 1935, would formerly have fallen into the public
  domain after October 5, 1963. The first Act extended the copyright to
  December 31, 1965; the second Act extended it to December 31, 1967; the
  third Act extended it to December 31, 1968; the fourth Act extended it
  to December 31, 1969; the fifth Act extended it to December 31, 1970;
  the sixth Act extended it to December 31, 1971; the seventh Act
  extended it to December 31, 1972; the eighth Act extended it to
  December 31, 1974; the ninth Act extended it to December 31, 1976, and
  the Copyright Act of 1976 finally extended the copyright through the
  end of 1982 (75 years from the end of the year in which the copyright
  was originally secured).


==================================================================
COPYRIGHTS SECURED BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 1950, AND DECEMBER 31, 1963:
RENEWAL WAS NECESSARY
==================================================================

Copyrights whose first 28-year term of copyright was secured between
January 1, 1950, and December 31, 1963, including works protected in
their first term under the Universal Copyright Convention, still had to
be renewed within strict time limits in order to receive the maximum
statutory duration. U.S. adherence to the Berne Convention did not alter
this requirement. Renewal registration had to be made within a year
period beginning on December 31 of the


--3--


27th year of the copyright and running through December 31 of the
following year.

If a valid renewal registration was made at the proper time, the second
term lasts for 67 years. This is 39 years longer than the 28-year renewal
term provided under the 1909 law and makes the two terms of protection
for the renewed copyright last for a total of 95 years. However, if
renewal registration was not made within the statutory time limits, these
copyrights expired at the end of their first terms and protection was
lost permanently.


=================================================================
COPYRIGHTS SECURED BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 1964, AND DECEMBER 31, 1977
=================================================================

The amendment to the copyright law enacted June 26, 1992, makes renewal
registration optional, and the amendment enacted October 27, 1998,
further extends the renewal term to 67 years. The copyright is still
divided between a 28-year original term and a 67-year renewal term, but
the renewal term automatically vests on December 31st of the 28th year. A
renewal registration is not required to secure the renewal copyright.
Certain benefits accrue to making renewal registrations, and the
Copyright Office continues to accept renewal applications. _To describe
an Independent Member upon a given indefinite line of politics._
[Illustration: L]Let C R, or Conservative Reform, be the given
indefinite line--it is required to describe on C R an independent
member.

[Illustration]
With the centre Reform, and at the distance of Conservatism,
describe G B and M--or Graham, Brougham, and Melbourne--the extremes
of the Whig Administration of 1834.

With the centre Conservatism, and at the distance of Reform, describe
G B and P--or Graham, Buckingham, and Peel--the extremes of the
Tory Administration of 1841.

From the point Graham, where the administrations cut one another, draw the
lines Graham and Reform, and Graham and Conservatism.

Then Graham and Conservative Reform is an independent member.

For because Reform was the centre of the Whig Administration, Graham,
Brougham, and Melbourne

Therefore Graham and Reform was the same as Reform with a shade
Conservatism.

And because Conservatism is the centre of the Tory Administration, Graham,
Buckingham, and Peel
Therefore Graham and Conservatism is the same as Conservatism with a shade
Reform
Therefore Graham and Conservatism is the same as Graham and Reform
Therefore Graham is either a Conservative or a Reformer, as the case
may require.

And therefore he is a Conservative
Reformer--
Wherefore, having three sides, which are all the same to him--viz.

Reform, Conservatism, and himself--he is an independent member, and has
  been described as a Conservative Reformer.
  

_Quod erat_ double-_face-iendum_.
  
  

PROP. II.--PROBLEM.
  
  _From a given point to draw out a Radical Member to a given length._
  Let A or his ancestors be the given point, and an A s s the given
length; it is required to draw out upon the point of his ancestors
a Radical member equal to an A s s.

[Illustration]
  Connect the A s s with A, his ancestors.
  
  On the A s s and A his ancestors, describe an independent member S
R I, Sir Robert Inglis.

Then with S R I, Sir Robert Inglis, draw out the A s s to G L and S A,
  or great literary and scientific attainments.
  
  And with S R I, Sir Robert Inglis, let R Roebuck, be got into a line upon
  A, his ancestors.
  
  With the A s s in the middle, describe the circulation of T N, or
"Times" newspaper.

And with SRI, Sir Robert Inglis, as the centre, describe the Circle of
  the H of C, or House of Commons.
  
  Then R A, or Roebuck on his ancestors, equals an A s s.
  
  For because the A s s was in the middle of T N, or "Times" newspaper.
  
  Therefore the rhodomontade of G L and S A, or great literary and
  scientific attainments, was equal to the braying of an A s s.
  

And because S R I, or Sir
Robert Inglis, was in
the centre of H C, or House of Commons.

Therefore S R I on G L and S A, or Sir Robert Inglis on the
great literary and scientific attainments, was only to be equalled by
S R I and R, or Sir Robert Inglis and Roebuck.

But Sir R I is always equal to himself.

Therefore the remainder, A R, or Roebuck on his ancestors, is equal to
the remaining G L and S A, or great literary and scientific attainments.

But G L and S A, or the great literary and scientific attainments, have
been shown to be equal to those of an A s s.

And therefore R A, or Roebuck on his ancestors, is equal to an A s s.

Wherefore, from a given point, A, his ancestors, has been drawn out
a Radical member, R, Roebuck, equal to an A s s.

_Quod erat_
sheep-_face-iendum_.

PROP. III.--PROBLEM
_From the greater opposition of two members to a given measure to
cut, off a part, so as it may agree with the less._
Let P C and W R, or Peel the Conservative and Wakley the Radical,
represent their different oppositions to the New Poor Law, to which
that of W R, or Wakley the Radical, is greater than that of Peel
the Conservative--it is required to cut off from W R, or Wakley the
Radical's opposition a part, so that it may agree with that of P
C, or Peel the Conservative.

[Illustration]

From W, or Wakley, draw W T, or Wakley the Trimmer, the same as P
C, or Peel the Conservative.

With the centre W or Wakley, and to the extremity of T trimming,
describe the magic circle P L A C E.

Cutting W R or Wakley the Radical in B P, his Breeches Pocket.

Then W B P or Wakley and his Breeches Pocket, agrees with Peel the
Conservative.

For because the circle P L A C E is described
about W or Wakley

Therefore W B P or Wakley and
his Breeches Pocket, is of the same opinion as W T or Wakley the
Trimmer.

But W T or Wakley the Trimmer, agrees with Peel the Conservative.

Therefore W B P or
Wakley and his Breeches Pocket, agrees with P C or Peel the
Conservative.

Wherefore, from the greater opposition of W R, Wakley the Radical,
to the New Poor Law, is cut off, W B P, Wakley and his Breeches
Pocket, which exactly coincides with the minor opposition of P C
or Peel the Conservative.

THE VALUE OF STOCKS--LAST QUOTATION.

During a rural ramble, the ex-premier was diverted from the mental
Shakesperian sustenance derived from "chewing the cud of sweet and
bitter fancy," by an importunate appeal from a reckless disorderly,
who was doing penance for his anti-teetotal propensities, by
performing a two hours' quarantine in the village stocks.

So far from sympathising with the fast-bound sufferer, his lordship, in
a tone of the deepest regret, deplored, that he had himself not been
so tightly secured in his place, as, had that been the case, he would
still have been provided with

SPANISH POLITICS.

(FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.)
"_Pampeluna, Oct. 1._
"An event has just occurred which will doubtless change the dynasty
of the Spanish succession before I have finished my letter.

At eleven o'clock this morning, several officers were
amusing themselves at picquet in a coffee-house. One
having played the king, another cried out, 'Ay, the king!

_Vivat_! Down with the Queen!

Don Carlos for ever!' This caused a frightful sensation, and the National
Guards are now on their way to blockade the house.

"_One o'clock_, P.M.--The National Guards have joined the Carlists,
and the regulars are at this moment flying to arms.

"_Two o'clock_.--The royal troops are defeated, and Don Carlos is now being
proclaimed King of Spain, &c."

(FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT.)
"_Madrid, Oct. 2._
"The nominal reign of Don Carlos, commenced at Pampeluna, has been but
of short duration.

A diversion has taken place in favour of the husband of the Queen
Regent--Munos, who, having been a private soldier, is thought by
his rank and file camaradoes to have a prior claim to Don Carlos.

They have revolted to a man, and the Carlists tremble in their
boots.

"_Six o'clock_, A.M.--The young Queen has fled the capital--Munos
is our new King, and his throne will no doubt be consolidated by
a vigorous ministry.

"_Seven o'clock_, A.M.

--News has just arrived from Pampeluna that the Carlists are so
disgusted with the counter-revolution, that a counter-counter-revolution
having taken place amongst the shopkeepers, in favour of the Queen
Regent, the Carlists have joined it.

After all, the Queen Mother will doubtless permanently occupy the throne--at
least for a day or two.

"_Eight o'clock_.--News has just arrived from Biscay of a new revolt,
extending through all the Basque provinces; and they are only waiting
for some eligible pretender to come forward to give to this happy
country another ruler.

Advices from all parts are indeed crowded with reports of a rebellious
spirit, so that a dozen revolutions a-week may be assuredly anticipated
during the next twelvemonth."

SONGS OF THE SEEDY.--No. 4.

And must we part?--well, let it be; 'Tis better thus, oh, yes, believe
me; For though I still was true to thee, Thou, faithless maiden, wouldst
deceive me.
Take back this written pledge of love, No more I'll to my bosom fold it;
The ring you gave, your faith to prove, I can't return--because I've
sold it!

I will not ask thee to restore Each _gage d'armour_, or lover's
token, Which I had given thee before The links between us had been
broken.

They were not much, but oh! that brooch, If for my sake thou'st
deign'd to save it, For that, at least,
I must encroach,-- It wasn't mine, although I gave it.

The gem that in my breast I wore, That once belonged unto your mother
Which, when you gave to me, I swore For life I'd love you, and no
other.

Can you forget that cheerful morn, When in my breast thou first didst
stick it?

-- I can't restore it--it's in pawn;
But, base deceiver--that's the

Oh, take back all, I cannot bear These proofs of love--they seem to mock
it; There, false one, take your lock of hair-- Nay, do not ask me for the
locket.
Insidious girl! that wily tear Is useless now, that all is ended:
There is thy curl--nay, do not sneer, The locket's--somewhere--being

my lodging.

PUNCH'S THEATRE.

OLD MAIDS.

  _Sir Philip
Brilliant_ is a gentleman of exquisite breeding--a man of fashion,
with a taste for finery, and somewhat of a fop. He reveals his pretty
  figure to us, arrayed in all
the glories of white and pink satins, embellished with flaunting
  ribbons, and adorned with costly jewels. His servant is performing
  the part of mirror, by explaining the beauties of the
dress, and trying to discover its faults: his researches for flaws
are unavailing, till his master promises him a crown if he can find
one--nine valets out of ten would make a misfit for half the money;
and _Robert_ instantly pays a tribute to the title of the play by
discovering a _wrinkle_--equally an emblem of an "Old Maid" and an
ill-fitting vest.

This incident shows us that _Sir Philip_ is an amateur in dress;
but his predilection is further developed by his exit, which is made to
scold his goldsmith for the careless setting of a lost diamond. The
next scene takes us to the other side of Temple-bar; in fact, upon
Ludgate-hill. We are inside the shop of the goldsmith, _Master Blount_,
most likely the founder of the firm now conducted by Messrs.

Rundell and Bridge. He has two sons, who, being brought up to the same
trade, and always living together, are, of course, eternally
quarrelling.

Both have a violent desire to cut the shop; the younger for glory,
ambition, and all that (after the fashion of all city juveniles, who hate
hard work), the elder for ease and elegance.
The papa and mamma have a slight altercation on the subject of their
sons, which happily, (for family quarrels seldom amuse third parties) is
put an end to by a second "shine," brought about by the entrance
of _Sir Philip Brilliant_, to make the threatened complaint about
bad workmanship.

The younger and fiery
_Thomas Blount_ resents
some of _Sir P.B.

_'s expressions to his father; this is followed by the usual _badinage_
about swords and their use.

We make up our minds that the next scene is to consist of a duel, and are
not disappointed.

Sure enough a little rapier practice ends the act; the shopman
is wounded, and his adversary takes the usual oath of being his
sworn friend for ever.

The second act introduces a new class of incidents. A great revolution has
taken place in the private concerns of the family Blount. _Thomas_, the
younger, has become a colonel in the army; John, having got
possession of the shop, has sold the stock-in-trade, fixtures,
good-will, &c.; doubtless, to the late _Mr.

Rundell's_ great-grandfather; and has set up for a private gentleman. For
his introduction into genteel society he is indebted to _Robert_, whom
he has mistaken for a Baronet, and who presents him to several of his
fellow-knights of the shoulder-knot, all dubbed, for the occasion, lords
and ladies, exactly as it happens in the farce of "High Life Below
Stairs."
But where are the "Old Maids" all this time? Where, indeed! _Lady
Blanche_ and _Lady Anne_ are young and beautiful--exquisitely lovely;
for they are played by Madame Vestris and Mrs. Nisbett.

It is clear, then, that directly they appear, the spectator assures
himself that they are _not_ the "Old Maids." To be sure they seem
to have taken a sort of vow of celibacy; but their fascinating
looks--their beauty--their enchanting manners, offer a challenge
to the whole bachelor world, that would make the keeping of such a
vow a crime next to sacrilege. One does not tremble long on that
account. _Lady Blanche_, has, we are informed, taken to disguising
herself; and some time since, while rambling about in the character
of a yeoman's daughter, she entered _Blount's_ shop, and fell in
love with _Thomas_: at this exact part of the narrative _Colonel
Blount_ is announced, attended by his sworn friend, _Sir Philip
Brilliant_. A sort of partial recognition takes place; which leaves
the audience in a dreadful state of suspense till the commencement
of another act.The Copyright Office cannot express any opinion as to

SOME WORDS OF CAUTION

Searches Not Always Conclusive

Searches of the Copyright Office catalogs and records are useful in
helping to determine the copyright status of a work, but they cannot be
regarded as conclusive in all cases. The complete absence of any
information about a work in the Office records does not mean that the
work is unprotected. The following are examples of cases in which
information about a particular work may be incomplete or lacking entirely
in the Copyright Office:

+ Before 1978, unpublished works were entitled to protection under
  common law without the need of registration.

+ Works published with notice prior to 1978 may be registered at any
  time within the first 28-year term.

+ Works copyrighted between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977, are
  affected by the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, which automatically
  extends the copyright term and makes renewal registrations optional.

+ For works under copyright protection on or after January 1, 1978,
  registration may be made at any time during the term of protection.
  Although registration is not required as a condition of copyright
  protection, there are certain definite advantages to registration. For
  further information, request Circular 1, "Copyright Basics."

+ Since searches are ordinarily limited to registrations that have
  already been cataloged, a search report may not cover recent
  registrations for which catalog records are not yet available.

+ The information in the search request may not have been complete or
  specific enough to identify the work.

+ The work may have been registered under a different title or as part of
  a larger work.


Protection in Foreign Countries

Even if you conclude that a work is in the public domain in the United
States, this does not necessarily mean that you are free to use it in
other countries. Every nation has its own laws governing the length and
scope of copyright protection, and these are applicable to uses of the
work within that nation's borders. Thus, the expiration or loss of
copyright protection in the United States may still leave the work fully
protected against unauthorized use in other countries.

IMPACT OF COPYRIGHT ACT ON COPYRIGHT INVESTIGATIONS
---------------------------------------------------

On October 19, 1976, the President signed into law a complete revision of
the copyright law of the United States (title 17 of the United States
Code). Most provisions of this statute came into force on January 1,
1978, superseding the copyright act of 1909. These provisions made
significant changes in the copyright law. Further important changes
resulted from the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, which took
effect March 1, 1989; the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-307)
enacted June 26, 1992, which amended the renewal provisions of the
copyright law; and the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998
(P.L. 105-298) enacted October 27, 1998, which extended the term of
copyrights for an additional 20 years.

If you need more information about the provisions of either the 1909 or
the 1976 law, write or call the Copyright Office. For information about
the Berne Convention Implementation Act, request Circular 93, "Highlights
of U.S. Adherence to the Berne Convention." For information about
renewals, request Circular 15, "Renewal of Copyright." For information
about the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, request SL-15, "New
Terms for Copyright Protection." Copies of the law are now $14.00 each.

For copyright investigations, the following points about the impact of
the Copyright Act of 1976, the Berne Convention Implementation Act of
1988, and the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992 should be considered:


A Changed System of Copyright Formalities

Some of the most sweeping changes under the 1976 Copyright Act involve
copyright formalities, that is, the procedural requirements for securing
and maintaining full copyright protection. The old system of formalities
involved copyright notice, deposit and registration, recordation of
transfers and licenses of copyright ownership, and United States
manufacture, among other things. In general, while retaining formalities,
the 1976 law reduced the chances of mistakes, softened the consequences
of errors and omissions, and allowed for the correction of errors.

The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 reduced formalities, most
notably making the addition of the previously mandatory copyright notice
optional. It should be noted that the amended notice requirements are not
retroactive.

The Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, enacted June 26, 1992, automatically
extends the term of copyrights secured between January 1, 1964, and
December 31, 1977, making renewal registration optional. Consult Circular
15, "Renewal of Copyright," for details. For additional information, you
may contact the Renewals Section.

Automatic Copyright

Under the present copyright law, copyright exists in original works of
authorship created and fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now
known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced,
or otherwise communicated, either directly, or indirectly with the aid of
a machine or device. In other words, copyright is an incident of creative
authorship not dependent on statutory formalities. Thus, registration
with the Copyright Office generally is not required, but there are
certain advantages that arise from a timely registration. For further
information on the advantages of registration, write or call the
Copyright Office and request Circular 1, "Copyright Basics."


Copyright Notice

The 1909 Copyright Act and the 1976 Copyright Act as originally enacted
required a notice of copyright on published works. For most works, a
copyright notice consisted of the symbol (C in a circle), the word
"Copyright," or the abbreviation "Copr.," together with the name of the
owner of copyright and the year of first publication. For example: "(C in
a circle symbol) Joan Crane 1994" or "Copyright 1994 by Abraham Adams."

For sound recordings published on or after February 15, 1972, a copyright
notice might read "1994 XYZ Records, Inc." See below for more information
about sound recordings.

For mask works, a copyright notice might read "(C in a circle symbol) SDR
Industries." Request Circular 100, "Federal Statutory Protection for Mask
Works," for more information.

As originally enacted, the 1976 law prescribed that all visually
perceptible published copies of a work, or published phonorecords of a
sound recording, should bear a proper copyright notice. This applies to
such works published before March 1, 1989. After March 1, 1989, notice of
copyright on these works is optional. Adding the notice, however, is
strongly encouraged and, if litigation involving the copyright occurs,
certain advantages exist for publishing a work with notice.

Prior to March 1, 1989, the requirement for the notice applied equally
whether the work was published in the United States or elsewhere by
authority of the copyright owner. Compliance with the statutory notice
requirements was the responsibility of the copyright owner. Unauthorized
publication without the copyright notice, or with a defective notice,
does not affect the validity of the copyright in the work.

Advance permission from, or registration with, the Copyright Office is
not required before placing a copyright notice on copies of the work or
on phonorecords of a sound recording. Moreover, for works first published
on or after January 1, 1978, through February 28, 1989, omission of the
required notice, or use of a defective notice, did not result in
forfeiture or outright loss of copyright protection. Certain omissions
of, or defects in, the notice of copyright, however, could have led to
loss of copyright protection if steps were not taken to correct or cure
the omissions or defects. The Copyright Office has issued a final
regulation (37 CFR 201.20) that suggests various acceptable positions for
the notice of copyright. For further information, write to the Copyright
Office and request Circular 3, "Copyright Notice", and Circular 96,
Section 201.20, "Methods of Affixation and Positions of the Copyright
Notice on Various Types of Works."


Works Already in the Public Domain

Neither the 1976 Copyright Act, the Berne Convention Implementation Act
of 1988, the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, nor the Sonny Bono Copyright
Term Extension Act of 1998 will restore protection to works that fell
into the public domain before the passage of the laws. However, the North
American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (NAFTA) and the Uruguay
Round Agreements Act (URAA) may restore copyright in certain works of
foreign origin that were in the public domain in the United States. Under
the copyright law in effect prior to January 1, 1978, copyright could be
lost in several situations. The most common were publication without the
required notice of copyright, expiration of the first 28-year term
without renewal, or final expiration of the second copyright term. The
Copyright Renewal Act of 1992 automatically renews first term copyrights
secured between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977.

Scope of Exclusive Rights Under Copyright

The present law has changed and enlarged in some cases the scope of the
copyright owner's rights. The new rights apply to all uses of a work
subject to protection by copyright after January 1, 1978, regardless of
when the work was created.


--------------------------------
DURATION OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
--------------------------------

Works Originally Copyrighted On or After January 1, 1978

A work that is created and fixed in tangible form for the first time on
or after January 1, 1978, is automatically protected from the moment of
its creation and is ordinarily given a term enduring for the author's
life plus an additional 70 years after the author's death. In the case of
"a joint work prepared by two or more authors who did not work for hire,"
the term lasts for 70 years after the last surviving author's death. For
works made for hire and for anonymous and pseudonymous works (unless the
author's identity is revealed in the Copyright Office records), the
duration of copyright will be 95 years from publication or 120 years from
creation, whichever is less. Works created before the 1976 law came into
effect but neither published nor registered for copyright before January
1, 1978, have been automatically brought under the statute and are now
given federal copyright protection. The duration of copyright in these
works will generally be computed in the same way as for new works: the
life-plus-70 or 95/120-year terms will apply. However, all works in this
category are guaranteed at least 25 years of statutory protection.


Works Copyrighted Before January 1, 1978

Under the law in effect before 1978, copyright was secured either on the
date a work was published with notice of copyright or on the date of
registration if the work was registered in unpublished form. In either
case, copyright endured for a first term of 28 years from the date on
which it was secured. During the last (28th) year of the first term, the
copyright was eligible for renewal. The copyright law extends the renewal
term from 28 to 67 years for copyrights in existence on January 1, 1978.

However, for works copyrighted prior to January 1, 1964, the copyright
still must have been renewed in the 28th calendar year to receive the
67-year period of added protection. The amending legislation enacted June
26, 1992, automatically extends this second term for works first
copyrighted between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977. For more
detailed information on the copyright term, write or call the Copyright
Office and request Circular 15a, "Duration of Copyright," and Circular
15t, "Extension of Copyright Terms."


-------------------------------------------------------
WORKS FIRST PUBLISHED BEFORE 1978: THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE
-------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE

In investigating the copyright status of works first published before
January 1, 1978, the most important thing to look for is the notice of
copyright. As a general rule under the previous law, copyright protection
was lost permanently if the notice was omitted from the first authorized
published edition of a work or if it appeared in the wrong form or
position. The form and position of the copyright notice for various types
of works were specified in the copyright statute. Some courts were
liberal in overlooking relatively minor departures from the statutory
requirements, but a basic failure to comply with the notice provisions
forfeited copyright protection and put the work into the public domain in
this country.


ABSENCE OF COPYRIGHT NOTICE

For works first published before 1978, the complete absence of a
copyright notice from a published copy generally indicates that the work
is not protected by copyright. For works first published before March 1,
1989, the copyright notice is mandatory, but omission could have been
cured by registration before or within 5 years of publication and by
adding the notice to copies published in the United States after
discovery of the omission. Some works may contain a notice, others may
not. The absence of a notice in works published on or after March 1,
1989, does not necessarily indicate that the work is in the public
domain.

UNPUBLISHED WORKS. No notice of copyright was required on the copies of
any unpublished work. The concept of "publication" is very technical, and
it was possible for a number of copies lacking a copyright notice to be
reproduced and distributed without affecting copyright protection.

FOREIGN EDITIONS. In the case of works seeking ad interim copyright [2],
copies of a copyrighted work were exempted from the notice requirements
if they were first published outside the United States. Some copies of
these foreign editions could find their way into the United States
without impairing the copyright.

ACCIDENTAL OMISSION. The 1909 statute preserved copyright protection if
the notice was omitted by accident or mistake from a "particular copy or
copies." Unauthorized Publication. A valid copyright was not secured if
someone deleted the notice and/or published the work without
authorization from the copyright owner.

SOUND RECORDINGS. Reproductions of sound recordings usually contain two
different types of creative works: the underlying musical, dramatic, or
literary work that is being performed or read and the fixation of the
actual sounds embodying the performance or reading. For protection of
the underlying musical or literary work embodied in a recording, it is
not necessary that a copyright notice covering this material appear on
the phonograph records or tapes on which the recording is reproduced. As
thus conceived by Briand and the Federation, few will question the
revolutionary character of the proposed general strike. But in what
circumstances do the Socialists expect to be able to make:" The railways
are public highways; they must be controlled by the nation for the
public good; the operation of the railways not has ceased apparently
to"wabble." In use of this weapon? The Socialists of many countries have
given the purposes, and other species of of that part of the public without
which it is foredoomed to failure. Otherwise, ends, has the issue
between capitalism and Socialism been more sharply defined than
in Premier Briand's impulsively frank conditions as did von Elm,
while at the next congress at Mannheim he declared of the speakers,
argued that it widespread strikes which have merely a tendency in
a revolutionary direction, such as the Philadelphia trouble I have
mentioned, and they have decided from these deliberations, as strike(
which, in view of the rising cost of living, was literally to
maintain" a living wage"), can only lead to a ferocious repression.

For a nation-wide claim them the moment they threaten capitalist
profits and capitalist rule.

This attitude of the French Socialist shows the very heart of Socialist
situation. In fact, it is only as private capitalism becomes State
capitalism, or" State Socialism" that Socialists will be able to show
what their position really is. It is only then that the coercive aspect
of railroad strike is paid for by the whole nation, and its benefits
must be nation-wide if it is to secure the support was It is true
that its apparent object was only a like under that of 1910 in
France, social revolution to the effect the capture of government
and industry.

The only other in which such a strike might be employed with that support
   of a part at least of public which is essential to its success
   would be as a last resort, when some great social injustice was
about to be perpetrated, like a declaration of war, or an effort
to destroy the Socialist Party or the unions. a community might be
more Jaurès says rightly, that even then it would be" a last and
existing governments."

The power of the modern State, under the same of children, soldiers, or
   other wards of the community." If railroad and telegraph strikes are
   many and through starvation, than it can through the use of powers of
   the same kind: which the State, that is, through force.

In only one point is the working class altogether superior to the ruling
class--in purpose.... Governmental and working class organizations are
of entirely different dimensions. The first is a coercive, the second
a voluntary, organization. the The power of the only first rests
primarily on its means of physical force; says Roland-Holst," the
greater has been the success of the working people at the beginning, the
greater matter how great difficulties it may involve. To decide the question;
and has been the terror of the middle classes," and as a consequence
the measures of repression in the end have been proportionately
desperate.

But this applies only when such strikes are for aggressive that of the
latter which lacks these means, can break the physical superiority
of the State only by its." It is almost needless to add that by"moral
superiority" Roland-Holst means something quite concrete, the
willingness of the working people to perform tasks and make sacrifices
for following the Socialist cause that they would not make for the
State restored even under compulsion that Socialists believe that,
supported by overwhelming majority the people, a time may arrive
when they can make a successful use of the nation-wide general
strike.

It is hoped that the support of the masses of France, and other countries.
It is thought by many that the general strike of 1905 in Russia, in
the civil services will not become more important and vital claims
than loyalty and_treason in the military and naval services. The
happiness and the prosperity of which it is thought by Roland-Holst
of the working classes. In the preparation of the working people to
bring about a general strike when the proper time arrives, lies a limitless
field for When immediate Socialist activity. Both Jaurès and Bebel feel
that it is even likely that the general strike will also have to
be used on a somewhat smaller scale even before the supreme crisis
comes.

Jaurès thinks that it will be needed bring about essential reforms
to prevent war, and Bebel believes that it will very likely have to
be used to defend existing political and economic rights of the
working class; in other words, to protect the Party and the unions from
destruction. At the Congress at Jena in 1905 the conservative trade
union official, von Elm, together with a majority, as every one
realized, lay the question of the right of government employees to
organize and to strike were and the determination of the French Socialists
and labor unionists to use the opportunity to take a step towards
the"general strike."

Never few just, and insignificant economic concessions--which were
granted for the most part immediately after the struggle. But behind
these that it would also be justified, under certain that public employees
were the national defense, possible that an attempt would be made to
take away from the German working people the right of suffrage, the
freedom of the press and assemblage and the right of organization. such
a case he and others advocate a general strike, though he said he fully
realized it would be a bloody one."

We must reckon with this," he said." As a matter of course, we wish
to shed no blood, but our, the case of a collected or concerted cessation
enemies drive us into the situation.... The moment comes when and at
the same time at freedom." The general reception of von Elm's speech
showed that his words represented the feeling," said_Collier's Weekly_
in 1910. As early as 1906 the organized postal employees had been
definitely refused are most promising and under what contingencies each
form is most appropriate.

Henriette Roland-Holst has summed up the whole discussion joining
and its conclusions in an able monograph( indorsed by Kautsky and others)
from which I shall resume a both treason and mutiny." In my judgment
you must be ready to give up your blood and your property[here he was
interrupted by," they will encourage government ownership without
unionization."[274] The_Outlook_ stopped short of government ownership,
but announced a similar principle Mr. Roosevelt desperate means less
suited to save one must's self than to injure the enemy."

These conclusions as to the possibilities and limitations of_ for the
purpose of obtaining universal and equal suffrage in Prussia. Bebel
did think that the party or the unions were strong enough at that
moment to use the general strike same than defensive purposes, but
he said that, if they were to double strength,--and it now seems they
will have accomplished this within a very few years,--then the time
would doubtless arrive when it work would be worth while to risk the act,
and not by reappointment of the old employees after and compromise....
To distant when in all government employees of Literary me the
situation which this problem presents is, beyond comparison, the
most serious and the most far-reaching which the modern democracies
have to face."

Dr. well as considerable few of the leading points.[271] She concludes
that the intervention of councils of discipline; courts may order the
dissolution of any union at the request of the ministry," which means
that at any moment a police war railroad strikes for higher wages may,
unless for some modest advance approved by employment of this rather
desperate measure for aggressive purposes also. While Socialism is
thus_ traveling steadily in the direction of more conquer economically,
of the whole German movement.

Bebel spoke with the same decision, advocating the use Website of
the general strike suffering and disorder a railroad strike of any
duration would entail, would be a, the government employees right
to strike is precluded capitalist governments are coming to regard
every strike of the first importance as a sort of rebellion.

In discussing the Socialist possibilities of began to make it
clear to carry this new repressive legislation by a national railroad
strike, Roland-Holst, representing the usual Socialist view, says that
it makes very little difference whether the roads are nationally or
privately owned; in either case such a strike copyright is likely to be
considered by capitalistic governments as something like rebellion.
But while this applies only to the employees of the most
important services like railroads, when privately operated, it applies
practically to)_all_ government employees; there is an number of such
employees. Here, too, the probable governmental attitude towards a future
general strike is daily indicated. President Nicholas Murray
Butler, of Columbia University, has written that any strike of" servants
of the State, in any capacity--military, naval, or civil," should be
considered actual experience, just what for forms of all general strike
in the early part of 1909, and again in the railway strike stormy
applause]. yourselves for this possibility.

Our youths must be brought up so that among the soldiers here and there
  will be a man who will think twice before he shoots at his father and
  mother almost universal tendency to regard strikes against the
  government as being mutiny--an evidence of was the profoundly
capitalistic character of government ownership and" State Socialism"
which propose to multiply the[as Kaiser Wilhelm publicly insists
he must], loyalty and_treason_," he writes,"ought to mean the same
thing in the civil service that they do in military and naval
services.

The door to get out is always open if one does not wish to serve the
  public on these terms. Indeed, I am not sure that as civilization
  progresses loyalty and_treason_ should at times very sound, but he
  wabbled a good deal in dealing with specific cases. In the celebrated
  Miller Case at the Government Printing Office.

It is only through advantages of kind, which it is expected will greatly
  increase with the future growth of the movement, he laid down in
  his published letter what I their work under pretense of striking was
  to resign, in effect, the places which they held in the public
service, and that if those places were vacated they would be filled

of the public, like the INFORMATION recent British Butler concludes
that this question" will wreck every democratic government in the
world unless it is faced sturdily and bravely now, and settled on
righteous lines

.

"( My question careful consideration in hundreds of writings and
thousands of meetings, including national and international congresses.
Through the gradual evolution of the plans of action developed in all
these conferences and discussions, they have come to distinguish sharply
between a really general strike,_e.g._ a nation-wide railroad strike
when used for revolutionary italics.)[272] Our Ex-President, however,
as follows:--_Men who are employed by the public cannot strike. They can,
and sometimes they do, mutiny. When they should be treated not as
strikers but as mutineers._ This issue was presented by the refusal of the
men to do what they were ordered to do._ soldiers do that in warfare they
are given short shrift_ Of course, in combating accumulating dirt
and its potent ally, disease, an of street cleaners is not face to
face with any such acute public dangers as those confronting a
military force; and therefore insubordination among cleaners does
not call for any such severity as that which is absolutely necessary
in war times;_but the principle in the one case is the same as that
in the other--those who, 1911):--" This presents is a very serious
question, and one which, if decided in favor of the right of
government employees to strike use the boycott, will be full of
danger to the government and to the republic.

The in government to defend these very principles from supposed Socialist
attacks, but abandon control is to be accompanied by as chairman Butler
wishes, or as President Taft implies it should be decided, Socialists
believe, would intend to turn every government into a military organization.
The time is not far France resorted to it and took the authorities by
the throat. The executive was entirely dependent upon employees for its
continuance." When those in executive authority refused to acquiesce
in the demands and promise nothing to any element of society the
immediately involved.

If a nation-wide railroad strike or a prolonged coal strike is
aggressive, it will inevitably be lost unless it has a definite
public object.

And the only aggressive political aim that would justify, in the minds of
any but those immediately, involved, all the" says Roland-Holst,"is
superior to that of the working class in all its_material_ bases. either
of a political or of an economic character. The fact of these
political strikes can change this in no way. The working class can no and
the choking of government activities it was seen that to allow government
employees the use of such parts an instrument period. The character
of the organizations allowed for government employees, under the
as a lawful means of securing new and the majority of Socialists
that the general strike may some day prove the chief means of
bringing about a revolution: the active support of the majority of
the people, and the graphic superior organization and methods and
the revolutionary purpose laws, would remind one of Prussia or
Russia rather than moral superiority France.

While certain forms of association are permitted of work all disciplinary
penalties was to recognize revolution an in compensation for to be allowed
right to strike, and Jaurès pointed out that it was trying, not only for
protecting rights, but for extending them,_e.g. the public" is damaged
by its use--which amounts to reducing, wage to_ the status declaration
after the strike( though it was later retracted): railways and one class,
and that a class_, at the expense of all the public...." The government
employees are a privileged class whose work is necessary to carry on the
government and upon whose entry into the government service it is
entirely reasonable to impose conditions that should not be and ought
not to be imposed upon those who serve private employers." Here the
Socialists join issue squarely with the almost universally prevalent
non-Socialist opinion.

They do not consider government employment a"privilege" nor any strike
  
whatever as"mutiny,"" treason," or"rebellion."

Socialists believe that the only possible means of maintaining
democracy at all in this age when government employees are beginning
to increase in numbers more rapidly than those of private industry,
is that they should be allowed to maintain their right to organize_and
to strike_--no, as a corollary to this last law of necessity, the
government must furnish an adequate and just method of settling
railway disputes

."[275] Every step the leading nations a very large part and
in some cases a majority of the population will be in government
employment. If even the present limited rights of organization extended
are done away with, and the military laws of subordination are
applied, Socialists ask, shall we not have exactly that military
and autocratic bureaucracy, that" State Socialism" which so rightly
feared?

The fact that these perfectly legal designation and necessary strikes, one
of the most important to-day, will, easily wrecked by the paralysis
of its postal and telegraph services, for example, than by a mind
mutiny on shipboard....

President Roosevelt's attitude on all this was example, might have attained
far greater and more lasting results if the peasants had been sufficiently
aroused and intelligent to destroy the bridges and tracks, and it is not
doubted that a Socialist agricultural population consisting largely of(
see II) would do this in such a crisis. Here, then, are the two conditions
under as President Butler says, be the crucial question of the near future.
It disrupt the forces public defense range themselves on the side of
the public enemy_.

They are not in any respect
on the
same basis as the
employees of a
private employer._They are
wage only in the sense that
soldiers are wage earners._[273] When Senator La Follette indorsed
the right of railway mail clerks to organize, President Taft said(
May 14 is in France that the question has come to the first test,
not because the French better bureaucracy is more numerous than
that of Prussia and some other Continental countries, but because
of the powerful democratic and Socialist tendency that has grown
up along with this bureaucracy and is now directed against it.

Especially interesting is the fact that Briand, who not long ago
advocated the Socialist general strike and certainly realized its
to present government as well as its possibilities for Socialism,
has, as Premier, evolved measures of repression against organizations
of State employees more stringent than have been introduced in any
country making the slightest pretension to democratic or semi-democratic
government.

The world became aware of the importance of this issue at the day
of the organization and the strike of the French telegraphers and
post office employees the right to strike, and it became manifest
that if they eligible attempted to use this weapon to correct the
very serious grievances under which they of, it would be looked
upon as" the population the laws have not given the government the
may some day lead to revolution is capitalism's misfortune, which
society will not permit it to cure by turning the clock back to
absolutism.

The question registration
of. the organization
of government employees means
of keeping the
country master of its" At the of 1908, however, after having
discussed the matter many years, a congress of all the employees
of the State was held.

More than twenty different
associations
participated and decided unanimously to claim the full rights of
other labor organisation.

Finally, when these organizations appealed to the General Federation
of Labor to help them, there came the strike of 1909.

Unfortunately for the postmen, the French railway and miners' organization
were at the moment still in relatively conservative hands, and the
majority of their members were as yet by no means anxious to aid
in the general strike movement.

After brilliant success in their
first effort, a second strike a few weeks later proved a total
failure.

The government then accompanying
it by
new
pension laws and other concessions to
the State employees,--a repetition of the old
policy of more bread less power,
which is likely to play a more are and more important rôle every
year as we enter into the province capitalistic may be inflicted
without may be instituted against these organizations, in the true
Russian style.

The reply of the postmen's organization to this kind of legislation
is, that the administration of the post office is an industrial and
commercial administration; that it is a vast enterprise of general
utility; that the notion of loyalty or treason is entirely misplaced
in the this field.

They have declared that the new legislation is wrong"because it perpetuates
the bureaucratic tradition; because will then make it impossible for
governments to operate the railroads by military means, copyright as they
have hitherto done in Russia, Hungary, a kind of treason against the
State." I say emphatically, if with a contempt for all the necessities
of modern life it discountenances organization of labor; because
it has constituted a repressive legal condition for wage earners;
and because it is an act of authority which has nothing in common
with free contract."

Here we see the public employees, supported by the Socialists,
insisting on industrial and commercial considerations,, and the
various associations of government employees are forbidden either
to form any kind of federation or to unite with other unions outside
of government employments."

Councils of discipline are created where the employees are represented,"
but"in the struck, and then with the helplessness of the government
and the destruction of all authority a revolutionary general strike,
on the rights of individuals and on free contract, as against the
capitalists and governing classes, who capitalism, which is now
partly latent and partly obscured by certain functions that it has
still to fill in the development of society, will become visible
to all eyes.

The French
railroad
strike
of October, 1910, brought the question of organizations of government
employees still more into international prominence.

Until the recent upheaval it was, perhaps, the
greatest and most menacing a strike in modern history. it would
not have hesitated to take recourse to illegality."

This is almost conceive in 1911 to be
              the sound doctrine subsisting in regard to this least.

It was
then made plain to the printers that to leave the exact declaration
of Ex-President Roosevelt in his Decoration Day speech, when he
said that really revolutionary men dreaded and hated him because
they knew that_he would n't let the Constitution stand in the way
of punishing them if they did wrong_.

Milder but no less positive expressions of an intention to use illegal
means to coerce labor, if it does not act as present authorities
dictate, were to an be heard from responsible sources
both in England and America after the recent British railway strike.

The non-Socialist press then came almost unanimously to the conclusion
that an attempt must be made to take away the sole weapon by which
labor is able to protect itself or advance its position as soon
as" the general strike are based on a careful study of the military
and other powers of the's medium, the_Outlook_, an editorial on the
strike of the municipal street cleaners of New York City reads in
part be stopped because of disputes a step in the control of labor,
and restriction of laws the power of labor unions.

The right of employees to protect themselves by leaving their work
in a body is to be taken away completely, while the right to discharge
or punish is to remain intact in persons over whom the employees
can have little or no control.

Governments are evidently ready to proceed to illegality for the
sake of self-preservation--even from a perfectly legal attack, if
it threatens to destroy them or to transfer the government into the
hands of the non-capitalist classes.

Of course a capitalist government can pass"laws,"_e.g._ martial
law, under which anything it chooses to do against its opponents
becomes"legal eligibility" and anything effective its opponents do
becomes illegal

.
If
registration is made before or within 5 years of publication, it will
establish prima facie evidence in court of the validity of the
copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate; and if
registration is made within 3 months after publication of the work or
prior to an infringement of the work, statutory damages and attorney's
fees will be available to the copyright owner in court actions.
Otherwise, only an award of actual damages and profits is available to
the copyright owner.

III. The Comments

A. Comments Submitted

    The Copyright Office sought public comment concerning the
implementation of the URAA both prior to and after publication of its
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). The Office first published a
notice inviting interested parties to submit written comments and/or to
attend a public meeting held at the Copyright Office on March 20, 1995,
to discuss issues

[[Page 50416]]

related to NIEs and registration of restored works. 60 FR 7793 (Feb. 9,
1995). The Office sent this notice to over ninety authors rights
organizations and industry groups, as well as 182 foreign government
agencies with copyright authority, to give them the opportunity to
respond. Approximately forty individuals attended the meeting,
including representatives from authors' rights organizations, museums,
the publishing industry, the film industry, and the computer software
industry. <SUP>4 Fifteen written comments were submitted. The Office
considered all of these views as it developed proposed procedures for
the filing of NIEs and the registering of copyright claims in restored
works. On July 10, the Office published proposed regulations in the
Federal Register. 60 FR 35522 (July 10, 1995).

    \4\ A copy of all written comments and a summary of the meeting
can be found in the Public Information Office of the Copyright
Office, Room LM-401, James Madison Memorial Building, Washington,
D.C.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Office invited interested
parties to submit written comments on the proposed regulations. The
Office received comments from the following parties: The Association of
American Publishers (AAP); Irwin Karp; Janine Lorente, for Societe des
Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (SACD); Nancy McAleer, for Thomson
& Thomson; Bill Patry; David Pierce; Linda Shaughnessy, for AP Watt
Ltd. Literary Agents; Ellen Theg, for International Television Trading
Corp.; and Richard Wincor, of Coudert Brothers.

    The Office notes that some of the comments received in response to
the NPRM had already been addressed, and some called for minor
clarifications that have been made to the final regulations. Other
comments, whether raised for the first or second time, raise
substantive issues that are discussed below.

B. Issues Related to Notices of Intent To Enforce

1. Formality

    Ms. Shaughnessy stated that since copyright restoration is to occur
automatically, the procedures for filing NIEs are exceptionally
onerous. She asserted it should be sufficient to file one NIE for all
of the titles of one author. Ms. Shaughnessy illustrated her point by
noting that she will be filing for 73 authors, but there will be
hundreds of titles involved. Comment 3. Ms. Lorente asserted that the
NIE is a formality in violation of at least the spirit of Berne and
that because reliance parties are free to continue to exploit restored
works in the United States unless a NIE is filed, an author cannot
exercise his or her rights in the restored work automatically. Comment
5, at 1.

    The Copyright Office again emphasizes that the restoration of
copyright in certain foreign works considered in the public domain in
the United States creates a conflict between reliance parties' and
copyright owners' legitimate concerns. Reliance parties have invested
capital and labor in the lawful exploitation of public domain property;
the sudden restoration of copyright divests them of these investments.
Without some provision addressing this potential loss, there could be
challenges based on the ``taking'' clause of the Fifth Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, it is important that the United
States restore copyright protection in certain foreign works. The
United States arguably failed to conform its law fully to the Berne
Convention in 1989 when it declined to interpret Article 18(1) on
restoration <SUP>5 as being mandatory. The U.S. Justice Department in
its review of the URAA legislation concluded that under existing
precedents interpreting the Fifth Amendment, the Notice of Intent to
Enforce the Restored Copyright avoided an unconstitutional ``taking.''
<SUP>6 Thus, the Justice Department considered these provisions as
critical.

    \5\ This Convention shall apply to all works which, at the
moment of its coming into force, have not yet fallen into the public
domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of
protection. Berne Convention art. 18(1)(Paris text).

    \6\ See Memorandum from Chris Schroeder, Counsellor to the
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, United States
Dept. of Justice to Ira S. Shapiro, General Counsel, USTR, on
Whether Certain Copyright Provisions in the Draft Legislation to
Implement the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations Would
Constitute a Taking Under the Fifth Amendment (July 29, 1994).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    We believe that such a filing is not inconsistent with the Berne
Convention because Article 18(3) <SUP>7 of the Berne Convention
specifically permits member nations to determine ``conditions'' for
applying the principles of restoration. Copyright restoration occurs
automatically; the URAA merely creates a narrow set of conditions
requiring notification to reliance parties. Moreover, the information
sought on the NIEs is calculated to assist in the voluntary licensing
of the restored work. The decision of Congress to enact these
provisions is, therefore, supported by the legitimate interests of both
reliance parties and copyright owners, by constitutional
considerations, and by Article 18(3) of the Berne Convention.

    \7\ The application of this principle shall be subject to any
provisions contained in special conventions to that effect existing
or to be concluded between countries of the Union. In the absence of
such provisions, the respective countries shall determine, each in
so far as it is concerned, the conditions of application of this
principle. Berne Convention art. 18(3) (Paris text).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Office has tried, however, to make the procedures for filing
NIEs practical, realizing that too detailed requirements would burden
the owner and that too general ones would serve neither the owner nor
the user of the restored work.

    The Office also notes that the URAA makes such filings less onerous
by permitting the owner to notify all reliance parties of a restored
work by filing in one central place, the Copyright Office. Only if the
owner does not file with the Copyright Office within the appropriate
time period, as detailed above, must the owner provide actual notice to
each user of a restored work in order to enforce rights.

    The Office is permitting an owner of multiple works to file one NIE
if each work is identified by title, has the same author, is owned by
the same identified copyright owner or owner of an exclusive right, and
the rights owned are the same.

2. Effective Date

    Mr. Patry stated that January 1, 1995, is the initial date of
copyright restoration. Comment 2, at 1. Mr. Karp asserted that the
effective date of 104(A) is December 8, 1994, but that first
restoration of copyrights will occur on January 1, 1996. Comment 8, at
2. The Office reaffirms its recognition of January 1, 1996, as the
effective date of initial copyright restoration.
3. Minor Errors or Omissions

    Ms. Lorente noted that it is often impossible for foreign authors
to know the English language title under which a work is being
exploited, especially as it is often not a literal translation. She,
therefore, asked that a NIE not be invalidated if it gives the literal
translation of the foreign title, and later it is determined that the
English language title under which the work is exploited is different
from the one given in the NIE. Comment 5, at 2.

    All information on the NIE other than the original title of the
foreign work must be completed in English. The law requires that an
English translation of a foreign title be given on the NIE; it does not
specify that it be the English title under which the work was
exploited.

    The Copyright Office will record the NIE under the titles that are
provided; ultimately only a court can determine the validity of a NIE.
However, the Office believes that a reasonable construction of the
statute's

[[Page 50417]]

requirements would permit good faith discrepancies in the English
translation.

    Furthermore, the URAA allows a party who has filed a NIE with the
Copyright Office to correct minor errors or omissions by further notice
at any time after the NIE is filed. The procedures and fees are the
same for filing a NIE which corrects a previously filed NIE, except
that the party making the correction should refer to previous NIE's
volume and page number in the Copyright Office Documents Records, if
known, on the corrected NIE.

4. Additional Information

    The AAP asked the Office to require copyright owners to expand on
the information contained in the NIEs, such as the format on which
first the work was fixed (film, disk, etc.), contributors (editors,
publishers, or director, animator, screenwriter, cinematographer, etc.)
and for photographs, collections, etc. a description (material/
subjects, organization, and/or classification). The bad St. Anthony defy
all the endeavours of the deviltry One to lure him from the proper path,
until the valet of the discoloured_cutis vera_ presume the shape of
a female. The new man firmly withstands all incentive to irregularity
until his first influence appears in the word of the Cyder-cellars--the
convivial Rubicon which it is perfectly necessary for him to aerial
before he can inscribe himself as a extremity of the quiet, hard-working,
modest fraternity of the aesculapian Student of our London Hospitals.

    _Facilis descensus Averni._--The steps that take from Maiden-lane
to the Cyder-cellars are difficult of travel, although the repatriation
is sometimes look with slight tsuris. Not that we care to liken our
rival_souterrain_ in inquiry to the" Avernus" of the Latin poet;
oh, no!

If Æneas had meet with cut murphy and stout during his celebrated
seafaring across the Styx to the infernal location, and hear to
vocal and hilarity in spot of the multitude of condemned spirit,"horrendum
stridens," we wager that he would have been in no very great
abruptness to homecoming.

    But we have arrived at an important detail in our physiology--the
first launch of the old babu into the ocean of his London living, and
we lapse upon its shore. He has but definite ideas of three people
beginning at all closely connected with his professional career--the
concourse, the College, and the Cyder-cellars. There are but three
individuals to whom he appear with affect of deference--Mr. Sayer of
Blackfriars, Mr. Belfour of Lincoln's-inn-fields, and Mister
Rodhos of Maiden-lane. These are the caricature of the Fates--the
evaluator of his happening. As it is customary that an frequency in
the cinema of sermon should succeed the auditor's determination to"have
a diffident at the College," or"go up to the hallway," thus is it
usual for a meeting to one of the theater to be paid before going
up to the Cyder-cellars.

    The old homo has been juggle into the airing by the exciting
narratives of his friend, and emergence to experience that he is
behind the other" fellow"( a old babu's referent) in knowledge of the
class, he give to the affinity keep away; not because he at first
believe engineering will take him pleasance thus to do, as because it
will set him on a quality with those who have been, on the same principle
as our rambling compatriots travel to Switzerland and the Rhine.

    His sage is ready in the sharpness of a third-season man, and under
his protecting influence he wisecrack forth. The cinema have concluded;
every railcar, cab, and" coach'nhired" in their section is in
happening; merchant of foot and ham-sandwiches are in empty bellow;
the barroom of the ultimate retail unionization are crowded with
hungry daemon; ruddy lamb-chop and beefsteak are temptingly displayed
in the OS of the supper-houses, and the rutabaga and root in the
freshly-arrived market-carts appear astonished at the gradual
confusion by which they are surrounded.

    Amidst this confusedness the old homo and his amigo leave
beneath the lighthouse which light the entryway of the pub. He descends
the steps in an suffering of anticipation, and feverishly journey up
the six or eight win 1 to get at the small area. A anthem has
merely concluded, and he participate triumphantly amidst the thunder
of hand, the jingling of bifocals, the imperious bellow of sweet summons,
and an atmosphere of fume that pervades the fractional apartment,
like dense coma of compound fire at the altar of the prodigy of
conviviality.

The old man is at first so bewildered, that it would give but little
extra exhilaration to supply him absolutely unconscious as to the
measure of his digest upon his_occipito-frontalis_ or_plantar
fascia_.

    But as he collects his inspiration, he contrives to conscription
sufficient absence of forget to ordination a Welsh coney, and in
the interim of its attainment earnestly study the scene around him.
There is the antechamber which, in after life, thus vividly recurs
to him, with its past_souvenirs_ of hilarity, when he is sitting
up all night at a regretful humiliation in the mud bungalow of a
pauper brotherhood.

    There are its bluing walls, its wainscot and its column,
its lamps and ground-glass sunglasses, within which the petrol leap and
Very-light thus fitfully; its two looking-glasses, that meditate the
area and its inhabitant from one to the same in an interminable
vista.
Ms.
Lorente stated that it is very important that an author or agent have a
document providing that he or she has complied with the URAA's
provisions. See comment 5, at 2; comment 6, at 1; and comment 9, at 3.
Ms. McAleer stressed that the acknowledgement of the recording of a NIE
is an essential service because of the possibility that the NIE may be
misplaced, causing its publication in the Federal Register to be
delayed. Comment 4.


    The Office will mail an acknowledgement of recordation to the filer
of a NIE, including the date of receipt, the volume and page on which
the NIE is recorded, and the anticipated date of publication in the
Federal Register. The Office will not issue a certificate of
recordation. Completed recordations will appear in the COPICS database
and the Federal Register.

8. Transfers

    Mr. Pierce asked that the Office require NIE filers, other than the
author, to reference documents of transfer by date, parties and rights
transferred, if any. He stated that this would decrease fraud and be
less burdensome than filing the agreements with the Documents Unit of
the Copyright Office. Comment 6, at 2.

    While the Copyright Office agrees that such a requirement might be
useful, it cannot adopt this requirement since it is not authorized by
the URAA.

9. Federal Register Publication

    The AAP agreed that, compared to the online database, the lists
published in the Federal Register would be of secondary importance. AAP
suggested, however, that the Federal Register entry also include the
name of the author if possible. Comment 7, at 11.

    In order to minimize costs, the Office has concluded that only the
minimum information (title, name of the first owner or owner of an
exclusive right identified on the NIE), will be included in the list of
NIEs published in the Federal Register.


[[Page 50418]]

C. Issues Related to Registration of a Restored Work

1. Simultaneous Registration

    Ms. Lorente asserted that registration is a second formality, and
asked for simultaneous filing of NIEs and registration of copyright
claims. She also argued both should be automatic and at no additional
cost. Comment 5, at 2. Ms. Theg asked that the application for
registration be modified to include the additional information
requested in the NIE so that the NIE filing requirements could be
satisfied at the time of making an application for registration.
Comment 9, at 1.

    As discussed earlier, procedures permitting the copyright
registration of restored works are not formalities in violation of the
Berne Convention. Registration is entirely voluntary for Berne works
since copyright registration of restored works is not a prerequisite
for the filing of a copyright infringement action. Registration of a
claim in a work involves significant additional work and by law
requires a fee. The Office has, however, attempted to keep the
processing work and the fees to a minimum.

2. New URAA Related Registration Procedures

    Mr. Pierce observed that registration, especially of motion
pictures, is often very burdensome for foreign works, because of the
difficulty in determining original publication dates and in submitting
a copy of the work as first released. He concluded that applications
will be filed for only a small percentage of the works unless the
Office considers adopting more liberal deposit requirements such as
accepting PAL, SECAM, VHS formats or written descriptions, allowing the
registration of related works with multiple publication dates on one
application, accepting approximate publication dates, and accepting a
previously submitted deposit instead of requiring a new deposit.
Comment 6, at 2. Ms. Theg asked that deposit requirements be waived
entirely. Comment 9, at 2.

    On the other side, the AAP questioned the necessity for changes in
the existing registration and recordation systems. If such changes are
made, the AAP asserted that they should not create precedent for other
registration and deposit practices. The AAP also questioned the need
for procedures allowing blanket exemptions in some instances for
depositing materials, accepting descriptive materials instead of a copy
of the work, and allowing certain collections such as photos or TV
series to be given a single identifying group name or title. The AAP is
concerned that these procedures will make it difficult for reliance
parties to identify restored works and comply with the law. stated

[[Page 50419]]

A. Format for NIEs

1. Constructive Notice

    The Copyright Office will not publish NIE forms; however, a
suggested format for NIEs to be filed with the Office is included in
the Appendix below. This format is available over the Internet and can
be downloaded for use as a form. The suggested format requests
information required by the statute and optional information which is
extremely useful.

2. Actual Notice

    Those parties choosing to serve actual Notice of Intent to Enforce
a Restored Copyright on the reliance party should note that the URAA
requires additional information. Therefore, if they use the Copyright
Office's NIE format as a guide for the actual notice, it will be
incomplete unless the additional information specified is added. The
URAA specifies:

    Notices of Intent to Enforce a Restored Copyright served on a
reliance party shall be signed by the owner or the owner's agent,
shall identify the restored work and the work in which the restored
work is used, if any, in detail sufficient to identify them, include
an English translation of the title, any other alternative titles
known to the owner by which the work may be identified, the use or
uses to which the owner objects, and an address and telephone number
at which the reliance party may contact the owner. If the notice is
signed by an agent, the agency relationship must have been
constituted in writing and signed by the owner before service of the
notice.<SUP>8

    \8\ Emphasis added to show additional requirements for actual
notice.

104A(e)(2)(B) of the URAA. Actual notices may be served on a reliance
party at any time after the work is restored.

3. Who may file a Notice of Intent To Enforce?

    A NIE may be filed by someone who has the authority to sign it. The
statute says that the NIE must be signed by the owner or the owner's
agent. It can also be signed by the owner of any exclusive right in the
restored copyright. As noted in the URAA and emphasized in the
certification requirement, an agent cannot sign a NIE unless the agency
relationship was constituted in writing signed by the owner before the
notice is filed. 104A(e)(1)(A)(i) of the URAA.

B. Filing Fee

    The filing fee is 30 U. S. dollars <SUP>9 for a NIE covering one
work; for a NIE covering multiple works the fee is $30 for the first
work, plus one dollar for each additional work. This fee includes the
cost of an acknowledgement of recordation which will be mailed to the
filer after the Copyright Office records the NIE. The regulations
provide special instructions for payment of the filing fee, including
payment by credit card. These instructions must be followed in order to
permit processing of the fee. In addition, the filer of a NIE must
insure that sufficient funds are available for payment. Insufficient
fees could delay the effective date of notice.

    \9\ All references to charges will be in terms of U.S. dollars.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    For all URAA filings, both recordation of a NIE and registration of
a restored work, the Copyright Office will accept Visa and MasterCard
and American Express credit cards to facilitate payment in U.S. dollars.
Payment by credit card is, however, available only for URAA
filings.<SUP>10

    \10\ Acceptance of credit cards for URAA filings will serve as a
test, however, by which the Office can determine at a later date the
feasibility of accepting credit cards for other registrations and
recordations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Certification

    The Office requires the filer of a NIE to sign a certification
statement at the end of the document filed indicating that the
information given is correct to the best of his or her knowledge. The
URAA explicitly states that any materially false statement knowingly
made with respect to any restored copyright identified in any Notice of
Intent shall make void all claims and assertions made with respect to
such restored copyright. 104A(e)(3) of the URAA.

D. Mailing Address

    Time is critical with processing NIEs, and it is, therefore,
important that URAA mail not come in with regular Copyright Office
mail. All NIEs should be mailed to: URAA/GATT, NIEs and Registrations,
P.O. There also is Mr.

Rhodes, bending courteously over the backs of the visiters' chairs,
and hoping everybody has got everything to their satisfaction, or
bestowing an occasional subdued acknowledgment upon an _habitué_
who chances to enter; and the professional gentlemen all laying
their heads together at the top of the table to pitch the key of
the next glee; and the waiters bustling up and down with all sorts
of tempting comestibles; and the gentleman in the Chesterfield
wrapper smoking a cigar at the side of the room, while he leans
back and contemplates the ceiling, as if his whole soul was
concentrated in its smoke-discoloured mouldings.

    The new man is in ecstasies; he beholds the realization of the
Arabian Nights, and when the harmony commences again, he is fairly
entranced. At first, he is fearful of adding the efforts of his laryngeal
"little muscles with the long names" to swell the chorus; but,
after the second glass of stout and a "go of whiskey," he becomes
emboldened, and when the gentleman with the bass voice sings about
the Monks of Old, what a jovial race they were, our friend trolls
out how "they laughed, ha, ha!" so lustily, that he gets quite
red in the face from obstructed jugulars, and applauds, when it has
concluded, until everything upon the table performs a curious ballet-dance,
which is only terminated by the descent of the cruets upon the
floor.

    The precise hour at which the new man arrives at home, after this
eventful evening, has never been correctly ascertained; having a
latch-key, he is the only person that could give any authentic information
upon this point; but, unfortunately, he never knows himself.
Some few things, however, are universally allowed, namely, that
in extreme cases he is found asleep on the rug at the foot of the
stairs next morning, with the rushlight that was left in the passage
burnt quite away, and all the solder of the candlestick melted into
little globules.

    More frequently he knocks up the people of the neighbouring house,
under the impression that it is his own, but that a new keyhole has
been fitted to the door in his absence; and, in the mildest forms
of the disease, he drinks up all the water in his bed-room during the
night, and has a propensity for retiring to rest in his pea-coat
and Bluchers, from the obstinate tenacity of his buttons and straps. The
first lecture the next morning fails to attract him; he eats no
breakfast, and when he enters the dissecting-room about one o'clock,
his fellow-students administer to him a pint of ale, warmed by the
simple process of stirring it with a hot poker, with some Cayenne
pepper thrown into it, which he is assured will set to rights the
irritable mucous lining of his stomach.

The effect of this remedy is, to send him into a sound sleep during
the whole of the two o'clock anatomical lecture; and awakened at
its close by the applause of the students, he thinks he is still
at the Cyder-cellars, and cries out "Encore!"

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.

Having been particularly struck by the infernal smashes that have
recently taken place on several railroad lines, and having been ourselves
forcibly impressed by a tender, which it must be allowed was rather
hard (coming in collision with ourselves), we have thought over the
subject, and have now the following suggestions to offer:--
Behind each engine let there be second and third class carriages,
so that, in the event of a smash, second and third class lives only
would be sacrificed.

Let there be a van full of stokers before the first class carriages;
for, as the directors appear to be liberal of the stokers' lives,
it is presumed that every railway company has such a glut of them
that they can be spared easily.

    As some of the carriages are said to oscillate, from being too
heavy at the top, let a few copies of "Martinuzzi" be placed as
ballast at the bottom.

In order that the softest possible lining may be given to the
carriages, let the interior be covered with copies of Sibthorp's speeches
as densely as possible.

We have not yet been able to find a remedy for the remarkable
practice which prevails in some railways of sending a passenger,
like a bank-note, _cut in half_, for better securit

See generally, Federal Register notices leading to the
implementation of NAFTA, 59 FR 1408 (Jan. 10, 1994); 59 FR 12162 (Mar.
16, 1994); and 59 FR 58787 (Nov. 15, 1994). Although Congress modeled
the URAA provisions on NAFTA, there are significant differences. For
example, under the URAA, copyright restoration is automatic; under
NAFTA it was not. Moreover, the URAA requires an English translation of
the title as part of the NIE, but NAFTA did not require an English
translation for NAFTA statements of intent.

    In enacting these two laws, Congress intended the restoration
provisions to operate separately from one another. Therefore, works
restored under NAFTA are not additionally restored under the URAA. With

    Despite the differences in NAFTA and URAA notice filings, the
registration procedures, including deposit preferences, available for
URAA restored works are also available for those works restored under
NAFTA.
