                           AN AMBUSCADE

Early in the year VIII., at the beginning of Vendemiaire, or, to
conform to our own calendar, towards the close of September, 1799, a
hundred or so of peasants and a large number of citizens, who had left
Fougeres in the morning on their way to Mayenne, were going up the
little mountain of La Pelerine, half-way between Fougeres and Ernee, a
small town where travellers along that road are in the habit of
resting. Long extinct Gesellschaftsvorfreuden I felt again in the
expectation of these guests. For the first time I am sorely missing
all of the many gracious devices with which I, as a daughter house to
decorate the table to understand - I had not even enough knives
and forks! Heavy heart I decided with the parents to borrow, what is
most necessary was missing. "Thou givest companies?" Mom asked astonished.
»Barely half a year after the death of your husband?"

"Only a few are interested in my central committee -," I replied evasively,
while the shame of these mendacious secrecy made me blush. Was it
coincidence or intention, that my father, shortly before I expected
my guests, came to me and institutions made to stay? In agonizing fear
I sat before him, all kinds of reasons devise to him, without
injuring him, to go to coerce. Finally he stood up. "My own daughter
throws me out," he said with a weary, blowing sound in his voice. "Dear
- dear papa! - "I wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed
him. At this moment, I came before me like a traitor. The evening that
I am so pleased, it was a pain for me * * * * * The next morning I
went to Stuttgart. An undefined hope that illuminates how was glad to
know, meet me: something very unusual would happen. At the station
received me Orbin woman. Their appearance was not impressive,
which I could have imagined. I saw nothing at first as a general shape
and sat under a large hat with disheveled feathers, the crooked head
sat on her and her shady trains. Almost I would have not recognized
it when she had him removed, and in the dining rooms of the hotel
to put me. Rotblonde hair is wavy bauschten to forehead and
temples, bright eyes, in all the lights of the Rainbow game, looked me
straight in the face, on the forehead, nose and mouth by digging small
vertical folds, leading to the still youthful and soft rounding of the
cheeks were embarrassed into mismatch. Without all of them immediately
began Höflichkeitspräliminarien my plan to ruthlessly ruffle. She
spoke with nervous Überstürzung, the words chasing each other, as if
one is the other swallow. »At a collaboration between you and us is,
of course, not to think. If on the other side something of the nature
of possible states have been -," a wary glance met-questioning me, -
"I would any such intention on the strongest fight. The political
struggle for us is A and O. Therefore, any Harmonieduselei with bourgeois
elements of evil and can only be confusing, the class struggle character
of our movement blur. Not the bridge opposites, such as bourgeois
idealists and ethicists wish, but they emphasize in the strongest
terms, is for us the main thing. Clean divorce - no concessions.
"I sighed deeply on. She understood me wrong and a fine ironic
smile curls her lips fleetingly. "That is not always easy, but for
people such as political parties, the only possible basis of their
existence." They invited me for the following day itself. Had my wife
not irritated, because the cause of the visit seemed no purpose to have
more. In an apartment of puritanical simplicity they welcomed me,
but an indefinable something, be it the choice of images, the
fall of the curtain or just the whole mood colors of space, betrayed
the artistic sensibilities of the nursing homes. And when her two boys
hereinstürmten fresh, Rotwang and shining eyes, I saw behind the
armor of the combatant people, the mother. As she was rich! -
We went out the afternoon before the city, the wooded hills hinan
that they so tenderly embrace. The children and nature seemed to
transform Orbin Wanda. It was much milder today. She talked about art
and literature with an understanding of an independent spirit and
melancholy unhappy lover. "That everything is asleep, has
to have to fall asleep to the large and comprehensive task," she said
finally, and her eyes got back to the feverish brilliance of
fanaticism. Scarcely were we in her apartment, as a man to her
hereinstürzte, out of breath a Depesche - and herschwenkend, while
behind him the eyes of the thick glass on the tears ran bearded cheeks.
»Angel - Angel is dead -" he painstakingly shows. With a defensive
movement of the hands - hands kurzfingeriger broad, which looked
as if the sculptor nature only in rough outlines sketched and
forget that they run - Wanda stared Orbin the accident messengers seconds
into his face. Then she threw up her arms and broke into a sobbing
konvulsivisches from under which her body is always violent trembling
began. Your feet would Fluctuating no longer wear, I thought, and
pushed her gently to a chair in which she sank unfounded. Meanwhile
the room had filled the exchange occurring between warm hands pressures.
All gathered around the weeping woman, quietly Flüstergespräche,
as would the dead among them, flew away after a long silence grimly
back and forth.

One family was this which had Stronger together than the blood: the
common feelings, thoughts and ideals derived from the depth of shared
grief for those who had been their leader. On tiptoe I crept out
and feel but with an overwhelming certainty, that I belonged to.
Late in the evening Orbin Wanda came again to me - very soft,
very loving. "They would be allowed, you we're not strangers," she
said. As I gained confidence and told her of the doubts and struggles
of the past few weeks. I saw how she smiled, - like an indulgent
parent about children suffering, but it does not hurt me. "In the
dichotomy of feelings which no one can help others," she said then.
"I know only one thing certain: this is your first conviction
completely clear and unshakable, as it disappears before the
mere feeling like Sommerschwüle before the storm. To arrive at this
conviction, this is certainly the heaviest. The logic of facts, bang
the living conditions of the proletariat means a view, of the bourgeois
idealist with great effort must be appropriated if it ever succeeds
in spite of all honesty, the old Adam of bourgeois ideas off. It is
so terribly difficult, out of his skin to go from that to
liberate what heredity and environment have made us.

"Her eyes looked like inside. We talked for a long time together. She
advised me now to carry out my plan, I would it perhaps best for
clarity, and to the Council and the - unofficial - help it, it should
not be missed. "Sit down in Berlin with the unions in combination,
specifically with the garment workers, the result of the movement in
which they currently stand, as a matter for your support should
consider. And then, above all, find our comrades Dr. Henry Brandt to
become interested. Win it, it helped you: he does everything by what
he wants. "Dr. Brandt! - I closed eyelids involuntarily lost in
memory. "All rivers flow into our sea," I heard a dark sounding voice
say, and fleeting - a dream image - a man appeared before me, blond
and slender, and deep gray eyes sank seconds into the mine. * * * * *
On my return I immediately wrote to John Reinhard, the leader of the
Garment Workers' Movement, and Heinrich Brandt. Reinhard me
immediately announced his visit shortly afterwards some Brandt
for the same hour. In the first strong feeling of joy, whose cause
I am not quite clear, I wanted to Reinhard copy to the other and
soon to be seen first.

About myself blushing, I tore up the card, which I had begun to write,
and asked instead, Brandt, to postpone his visit. "Shame," he replied,
"I would like to come immediately. Yesterday I read in the
wiener 'time' of an article by you, made me so delighted that the wish
for the author to know that I was busy. That request came on the same
morning, your letter. "And now, Reinhard stood before me, under the
left shoulder, the crutch, the face still yellow, as because I did for
the last time in the Egidyversammlung had seen, the black, thin hair
as though glued to order The broad skull and deep haggard temples.
"I think your plan is not for good, even necessary at this moment,
where the Reichskanzler the deadlock of social reform, not only
admitted, but defended, I would not be here so soon," he began
entertainment, by moving laboriously, the left leg straight out,
settled on the chair. "We are in the clothing since the beginning
of the year in a movement to me day and night can not sleep - -" I
know that the enforcement of operating workshops is, "I broke
him. "The Central Committee could not begin better than you to help."
He looked pleased at. "I see that you are oriented, and so I need
only add that your Central Committee also nowhere richer material to
the issue of women's work could be with us. Your impressions of
London, of which I have read the newspapers, they would not stand by
berliner. "I doubted the possibility of similar misery to us. Not
even at night if I had come from meetings, I had not seen so bitter,
as they told me in London in bright days had encountered. "Our poorest
ashamed - this is perhaps the last remains of humanity in
them," he said, "for weeks now I do almost nothing other than
visits to the home workers. I was just in an old paralyzed
woman, here in the west, five steps up, a einfenstriges windowless rooms
and a tiny kitchen with her daughter and their four small children
lived. From five to early night at eleven tramples the daughter of the
sewing machine to best nine brands in the week to earn. A few days
ago I was in a narrow pit, where a widow with two children live, on
the moldy furniture, on the shaky single bed, are elegant ladies'
blouses, for they mark only five times a week will take. "Reinhard rose,
red spots burned on his cheekbone, and while he further said, he
limped in the room excitedly back and forth.

"In another basement, where the floorboards rotten and the windows
beneath the earth is, two sisters - young, pale-addicted Dinger, -
for those who are fed up in the air and sun, laughing away. Is the
honor that you've preserved the miserable life worth - I would prefer
they be called. Seal under the roof, in two small holes, I saw a couple
with five children and a sleeping girl, the man pits on the rag
warehouse full of laryngeal cancer, the woman sews buttonholes for
all four brands in the week, "- quite -- folding - klipp - folding -
faster and faster beat Reinhard crutch to beat the horror of the melody
-, "a poor mother, I found in a sun-less angle to the north, they sewed
shirts, semi beaten them on the bed, where diphtheritiskranke two
children wrestled with death.

And just think, "- he stopped and laughed at grell," - a snow-white coat,
designed for bare shoulders of beautiful women, I saw once in the hands
of a syphilitic - "" For God's sake - you can hear on, "I, too, raised
me. »Why you cry, these facts are not on the public market? Why stick
your reports are not at all street corners? - No more Reichskanzler
would dare to break the deadlock of social reform to defend. ""
We are about to do it, "he replied, and his speech was once again the
sound of the old material at rest. "A brochure, in which I work,
will be sent to all relevant people and our party this year will be
presented, we have also, as you know, the entrepreneur before the
alternative asked, holding up workshops, or a general work stoppage to
his pursuit. Does it, then the public would need to contact us. BTW:
-, "he thought for a moment," how about if the central committee of
your activities on your own and start me on my searches would sometimes
accompany? "Thankfully I took his offer of at. The next time I
was almost daily a few hours with him. We came in districts that I
have never seen before, a long, sober lines of road, the houses
strung regularly, evenly gray whitewashed, and the bleakness of sight
only increased by the outer order and cleanliness. We exceeded farms
close behind in dark houses, the lights of the street no longer
fear and without shame to nakedness revealed their plight. To the
east, south led us the way, where in the middle of the barren, the
city has given low-floor high tenements to zerwühlten, roads were
expectant. Here, between the damp walls, lived the misery and
stared at us with shining eyes countless extinct life, the cruel cut
to the soul than the wildest cries of despair. Often when we are
out of the darkness came sparingly distributed lanterns and the light
of the City of Frederick us brilliantly received, adhered to my
wondering eyes the shiny mirror panes of shops and restaurants.
Boasting spread beyond the one all the glories that refresh the
palate, adorn the body, enrich the lives, laughing, joking, with
full pockets and shining eyes sat behind the other, the lovely
women, whose sole raison d'être as their beauty seemed to be , and
the men who pay homage to them.

How was it possible that from outside, from the gray row houses and the
streets become, not crowded, quiet soles on how Gespenster night,
here are pushed to all the glory to smash, the laughter to solidify?
And nests in my heart a hatred for all those who could not hate more.
* * * * * In the early morning of the 18th August was there. A poor
woman, I had visited, which I at one of our paths had found. She
was dying sick, - oh, and how happy she wanted to die, if only the
children would have been stronger than they Arzeneien all the world
to life chained. The transparent fingers are not allowed to sleep
peacefully folded together, they were desperately the white canvas,
in order dainty name trains, proud and free Mr. Graf hineinzusticken
crowns. A little bit of hope I had brought her, - hope that they will
soon die quietly allowed. Well, I went home, his head lowered and the
sun did hurt me. At King Street, I ended in a swarm of people
who woke me with: geputzt women with that out of curiosity, excitement
and nervous tension mixed expression in the trains, the ordinary
people at all major events - be it fire or wedding celebrations,
- characterized , men in their Sunday best, some sort of medal or
a cross on the chest, which in these days of carte blanche for
everything was drunkenness - they called her enthusiasm - brutality
against Nichtdekorierte, - one called it patriotism.

I saw around me: Flags fluttered from buildings, street vendors offered
krähender voice with medals from the Emperor, distant sound of
drum roll, Pferdegetrappel.

Correct: the cornerstone of the national monument was today.
With affectionate nostalgia, as the Greisin yellowed love letters,
the father had yesterday the General Uniform tissue paper out of their
shells removed, the embroidery, buttons and many even with a orders
Lederläppchen dusted and was certainly this morning full excitation,
drove to the castle. Now we were even up close behind the constable
vorgedrungen chains. A forward's no longer there, a return even less.
It was bearable. The Gala of the German princes car rolled over in her
old-fashioned heavy splendor, step, bellowing the Guard moved to the
Castle Square, waving behind her with flags Ulan, Dragoner and
flashing Küraß the Gardedukorps.
Berta was on all matters of Mary short answer, and
this, whether it be that they realized what her friend to proceed,
either because they themselves had a great pain, had gradually become
more remote, has become monosyllabic. But on Both weighed disrupting
their existing friendly relationship until quite difficult, as it
seriously and silently in their chamber occurred. They had been all
those little service done, what young girl just to even closer
friendship link. How very different it was today! Berta had the
silver needle from the rich blond hair pulled that ring in long curls
over the beautiful neck herabströmte. She tried it under the bonnet at
night stuck, unusually, this work without the help of Mary to
perform, she had not got to the edge, but too proud to be their enemy,
as Mary mentioned in her mind, her embarrassed to know they threw the
bonnet into the corner and grabbed a cloth to make it to the hair to
come. Silently Marie took the discarded bonnet and stepped back to add
the hair of their base after the normal way to organize and
aufzubinden. "route, you wrong!" cried the enraged Berta, by the
helpful hand zurückstieß. "Berta; hab 'ich Dich to deserve this?"
Marie spoke with calmness and gentleness. "Oh, if only you knew how
unhappy I am, you would be gentle on me!" "Unhappy?" who laughed out
loud, "unfortunate, perhaps, because the Lord just like once
danced with you?" "You are quite hard, Berta," Marie replied,
"You're mad at me and tell me again why not?" "So? So you want to not
know that you've betrayed me? Do not know how me your secrets to the
ridicule and the shame suspended? I would have never believed that
you are so bad, so wrong, would act on me!

"From new awoke in Berta the hurtful feeling to see your hintangesetzt
tears flowed, she put the hot forehead in his hand, and the rich
hair flowed over her and concealed the wine end. tears are
the characters milder pain. Marie knew that tears and drove with
more confidence continued: "Berta! Schilter you my secret. I see
you've guessed what I never could even tell. Put yourself in my situation.
Ah, you yourself, so bright and open You are, You even had me Your
secret can not trust. But now it is made. You know what my lips to
pronounce itself shy. I love him, yes I will be loved, and not only
from her yesterday. Will you hear me ? Can I tell you everything?
"Berta tears still flowed. You did not answer to those questions, but
pointed to Marie to tell how they Georg in the house of the Blessed
Muhme know that.

How they have been good to him, long before he confessed his love for
her all those wonderful memories living in her, with glowing cheeks,
with bright eyes led them up the past.

She told of many a fine hour of their oath of loyalty from their
farewell "And now," she continued with a melancholy smile, "now it
has this unfortunate war in this side.

He hears that we are here in Ulm, he believe otherwise, as my father
had joined the Confederation, he hopes, through me to earn his
sword because he is poor, quite poor Oh Berta, You know my father. He
is so good, but also as strict, if somewhat contradicts his opinion.
Is he a man give his daughter, his sword against Württemberg has
withdrawn? See, those were my tears! Oh, I wanted you so often
say, why it goes, but an invincible shame closed my lips. Can you I
still angry?
From the neck down he was wrapped in
a "sarrau" or smock, a sort of russet linen blouse, coarser in texture
than that of the trousers of the less fortunate conscripts. This
"sarrau," in which an antiquary would have recognized the "saye," or
the "sayon" of the Gauls, ended at his middle, where it was fastened
to two leggings of goatskin by slivers, or thongs of wood, roughly
cut,--some of them still covered with their peel or bark. But now it's
late. "And she was almost frightened, because the conversation was
about the midnight hour passed. For some time the colonel was already
very quiet, he was back in his armchair and was firmly asleep. Uncle
Max had do not sleep because of the story of the poor were WISI him
all youth Ascended memories so vivid that it is still a lot of
things and people wanted to discuss. But his sister was adamant, she
held the lamp in his hand and urged to leave. So because nothing
helped. But not just the unwelcome disruption to bear, he woke his
brother with such a huge jerk in his chair, that the colonel with a
horror shot upwards, as if an enemy bomb on him there. But his
brother knocked him peacefully on the shoulder and said: "It was
just a quiet reminder from your wife, that we want to retire." The
withdrawal was completed, and soon the house was at the height quite
still in da Moonlight. And at the bottom of the mountain standing
one, because it should also be stopped soon. Now even burned a weak
light inside, and threw his dull sheen by the pusher narrow
window into the night monderhellte.

Chapter 3 (also still at home) At the same time as the children of the
Supreme went home, ran the small Wiseli from all forces down the hill.
Because it knew that it was left to continue longer than expected,
the mother and the other did not.

But now his luck had been so great that there is a Go home now
forgotten. Now it ran so fast and would be almost a man
hineingerannt, who just out of the door of the cottage came when it
wanted to rush into it. He went to him but softly out of the way,
and leapt forward in Wiseli the room inside and the mother, on
a small chair by the window and sat on Wiselis astonishment still
no light was kindled. "Mother, are you angry that I am as long
materialize?" it cried and hugged her. "No No, Wiseli, "she replied
kindly." But I'm glad that you are there. "Now began the Wiseli the
mother of his great adventure to tell you how well the gasoline to him
had been, and how it twice with the Sledge had the most beautiful
mountain hinunterfahren can. When it came to his story was finished
and the mother is still so quiet sitting, until he remembered that
they otherwise did not.

It asked surprised: "But why have you still no light, mother? ""
I'm so tired tonight, Wiseli, "she replied."

I could not get up and light it. Get the lights come and bring me a sip
of water, I have such great thirst. "Wiseli ran into the kitchen
and came back soon, in one hand and the light in the other a bottle
of red juice gleamed so bright and inviting, that durst question ill
pleased exclaiming: "What you bring to me beautiful, Wiseli?" "I do
not know," said the child, "it stood on the kitchen table, see
how it sparkles."

The mother took the bottle in the hand and smelled it. "Oh,"
she said, "like fresh raspberries from the woods, give me a
quick little water to Wiseli."

The child poured red juice into a glass and filled it with water, and
thirsty trains the mother drank the refreshing Beerensaft.

"Oh, how refreshing," she said and handed the empty glass to the
child.

"positioning it away, Wiseli, but not far.

I am, I could drink up everything, so I'm thirsty. Who gave me this
bottle because it?

Certainly the Trine, it comes from the woman colonel. "" Was because
Trine with you in the room, mother? "
There seemed such a total absence of all human
intelligence about the man that the officers compared him in turn to
the cattle browsing in the valley pastures, to the savages of America,
or the aboriginal inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope. I have to go
because people will not let me live. Is that I can not neglect. I
dress at home ... I feel a whisper, like thieves step, look, I see
a bundle, I yelled ... Is it that the rat has entered and is
draining on the furniture. Nothing, that go by quickly, and my dear
aunt, I had the clothes on the rack and is has been everything we
had in the pocket of the vest. The founder, attacked a convulsive
hilarity, laughing with all her soul . - But look here, crook
- he said drying up the tears that laughter had to spring from her eyes
- if you do not use good media. Come on, son, you rob yourself ... you
know the saying ... that you will steal you right to Heaven. -
Where you going to go is to _Modelo_ ... - Shut up, bobón, and I
do not complaints, mind you ... not worse will follow this dialogue,
which promised much to the game, because the hall called Moreno
forceful insistence.

Oíase since talk of a cabinet rumor alive, agitation and mixing
several voices, among which are clearly distinguishable from those
of Juan Villalonga and smooth, just go.

Moreno was there, and Wilhelmina, who had not yet finished
laughing, said to his friends. "It is a angelón ... You have no idea
of the heavenly pasta that is made the heart of this man.
"Barbarita did not calm until you know why that riot in the salon was.
He went to see and came back with the story: "Daughters, the king
leaves. - What you say, woman!

- Que D. Amadeo, tired of struggling with these people, pull the crown
out the window and said: 'Go you to dial the devil. "- Everything
is God! - Guillermina said sighing and giving back to their work
undisturbed. Jacinta went to the living room rather than hear
the news, to see that day that her husband had not eaten at home.
"Hey - you said Guillermina secret , arrested, and both are
regarded with mischief - with twenty sonsaques it is hard enough.
"- iii - 'stock exchange knew nothing. I learned in the ten Bolsín -
Villalonga said -. I went to the casino to bring the news. When I
returned to Bolsín, was being consolidated to 20. - We've seen 10,
gentlemen - said the Marquis de Casa-Munoz in the tone of
Hamlet. - The Bank at 175 ... - exclaimed D. Baldomero hand going
through your head, and throwing a glance towards the ground dead and
gone. - Sorry you, friend - Moreno rectified Island -.

Is 172, and if you want to buy my own 170, the long now. I do not want
more paper for the beloved homeland. Tomorrow I go to London. -
Yes - said putting face Aparisi prophets - because that is
going to build here, will órdago. - Gentlemen, let us not be
impressionable - said the Marquis de Casa-Muñoz, who liked to
dominate situations look high -. That good sir is tired, it was not for
less, said: "That is why '. In your case I would have done the same.

An unheard-of
ferociousness, a brutal obstinacy, but also a regard for the sanctity
of an oath; a complete ignoring of our laws, our customs, our dress,
our modern coins, our language, but withal a patriarchal simplicity
and virtues that are heroic,--unite in keeping the inhabitants of this
region more impoverished as to all intellectual knowledge than the
Redskins, but also as proud, as crafty, and as enduring as they. The
position which Brittany occupies in the centre of Europe makes it more
interesting to observe than Canada. Surrounded by light whose
beneficent warmth never reaches it, this region is like a frozen coal
left black in the middle of a glowing fire. From its dark woods,
their sinister castles and cities close our ancestors longed after
laughing sky of Italy, and the seriousness of our daily life requires
strict everything that is young in us, after the gloss after the
recklessness of Paris. But I tried myself to appear calm and stormy
aufwogenden joy of my Lord to be. "What do you say this?" Asked my
husband "We would have to decide quickly. With the International
Socialist Congress, which meets ten days, my work would begin. "" And
your archive? "I threw. "You can do it but not many months of
editing from France!" "Oh, - the archives ..," he said with half of
the disposable, half-annoying tone that let me look up surprised.

The Archives was his creation, his favorite child mind. "The
archive, I could manage from anywhere! In Paris, but now it seems
to me the right place to socialism in its latest phase, to study
in Paris, where a minister is Millerand where intellectuals -
among them a Zola, a France, a Steinlen, - with Jaurès Arm in arm go!
.. So if you do not mind, so I suppose the motion. "* * * * * Paris!
The setting September sun surrounded the city with black hingestreckte
glowing glory. I was as sound in our train wheels roll a rhythmic
cheer, as if the giant snake fauchend not wait to play in the
blazing embers to fall. The morning after our arrival we walked
through the streets. It was the perfect surprise to me more and more
silent left. I had a little loud, colorful expected, something that
corresponds to the term "Paris", which we have set out. And now I saw
houses in equally fine lines restrained architecture, high
narrow window with grids before, saw walls, over which the ivy
crept, and giant tree, the courtyards of old silent mysterious
herüberrauschten. I saw how the many avenues suddenly wide, wide lost
gardens under whose gray statues dreamed shrubs, and trees round
laurel silent Bassins golden glitter of the many small fish in it.
An ancient churches we came over with a thick round and square towers,
or the mystical chaste Gothic tracery on the old portals. For Madeleine
exceeded the wide stone staircase up and came from the pagan splendor
of its pillars in the hall Dämmerdunkel its interior. A beautiful nun
knelt motionless at the entrance to the collecting box in advance
narrow white hands. And when we turned to go back, the eye wanders
over to our feet extending road and the majestic size of the Place
de la Concorde, where people and cars are lost, such as toys, up to
the dome of the widely Invalides.

He watched what was mortal of the Corsican giants, the world shaped
according to his will and a Living, yet today the city of Paris
met. Through broad avenues chestnut trees, whose dark leaves big
black shadow on the bright way threw, went We slowly climb, where
the Arch of Etoile is soft Morgennebeln plays around with the clouds
seemed to merge. And in the gardens of the Tuileries, we lost.
Delicate children with artificially low curls were fine places to
play, old men, with the red ribbon in the buttonhole, fed the birds
from a crowd of spectators surrounded, whose interest was almost like
prayer. From the trees danced softly, the yellow leaves, and a dreamy
sweet air, the sounds and colors dampened, played tenderly by the gray,
royal palace of the Louvre and gently stroked the faces of the passers,
as she wanted to comfort them, because it already had become autumn.
And even the beggar on the bridge, and the dirty Savoyardenknaben
who offered their wares for sale, and the old bookseller who
stockfleckigen Schartäken on Quaimauern built, smiling quietly.

The river rushed but is silent over his broken water shone in colors
such as opals tired. "An elegant woman is Paris," I said thoughtfully,
as we are starting our first returned, "a refined woman whose
beautiful melancholy of the trains aging umflort ... "In the
evening we left the hotel again. Now the world rustled City: rustling
dresses, rolling carts, girrendes laughing, yelling desert - to a
single sound, it all melted. Between the trees of the boulevards
radiated lanterns as the endless chains of lights, wide quoll
the light from the cafes on wippende Federhüte and reflecting
cylinder.

Only on the huge impact the Concordienplatz arc lamps such as
diamonds on the dark gray velvet of the night. Suddenly shone
among the trees beyond a miracle: a shimmering jewel built gate,
behind a fairytale city whose walls crystal, whose towers were fires
and the World Exhibition. We followed the teeming stream of people,
whose noise from all the languages of the world put together. It was
a dream only of Thousand and One Nights. A tower of shining gold threads
woven wore his diamond point on the black dome of the sky. In deep dark
ponds spilled cascades of light. The silent river mirrored palaces
back to all the splendor of the world on its banks were united. The
bridges spanned over him like a loud glückverheißende rainbow. And
if they exceeded the other side received a smile, a singing, a
rejoicing, - as if there were no more tears. A frenzy seized the
people from the terraces down - from the wide open doors of colorful
houses lured into the joy yearning violin tones, in wild trumpet
clashes. They danced Loie Fuller, the flame has become alive when they
are swung upwards, züngelten the veil over her head when she bowed,
lit up seconds her snow-white bosom.

Yonder trippelte on Sada Yacco heeled shoes, the Japanese, from their
slit eyes poured bursts fanatical art, on their robes gleamed Flowers
of Hell and birds of paradise. And under the colorful tent ring were
snakes around the body of the half-Indierin, züngelten tenderly to her
brown skin, while their small feet, of gold rings umklirrt, in
bars and moving her arms to ausstreckten - a single gesture demanding
lust .. . * * * * * Amidst the throng we met vultures at the Congress
Socialists had come to Paris. "A giant variety, - nothing more," he
growled, "essentially repulsive." I awoke as if from a dream: the faces
of the dancers appeared to me suddenly grimace liable, where the
makeup is blurred, grinned behind the smile of joy the crude drug for
profit.

And the lichtgewobene tower, the sky wore was made of iron; Menschlein
confidently climbed up into his head, and the most majestic dome
star far, far back before them. Scenes from plaster and canvas were
the palaces, the glass jewels in the portal. "One should not be a
moon addicted to address," I said. »Do you think I'm really on the
way to satisfy a longing, which to me seems to be born -" "And
this?"

Asked Henry. I hesitated, I knew how wrong I could be.

"Bacchantische like to see surplus, jauchzende life bliss, - the
is a god worthy.

More joy is something miserable, - discouraged. "" Then you are
in any event in Paris at the right place. Incidentally, I would
have your dignity northern German princess is not as exotic fantasies
believed, "mocked vultures.

"But after all, - I, as the old Paris, perhaps you can still serve."

We left the show, crossed the square to the Rue Royal. "Maxim"
was in large letters above the door of the restaurant, we entered
into the .

At the high chairs in front of the table Schenkenberger the bar sat
elegant men with tired and bored faces. From the room behind it
sounded subdued music.

The women among its mirror walls to the small, flower-tables
whispered just here and there with each other. They were all beautiful
and young.

Light blond and luscious in a white silk dress, pearls in the rosy
ears trickling round beads around the neck and a dull luster pearls in
the large bright eyes.

The other Statue of imprisonment beside her, the magnificent
figure tightly wrapped in red velvet, the narrow finger of Diamond
rings overcast, the night black hair into smooth Scheiteln around the
temples. And red, transparent skin behind their blue veins
knocked, brunette, with a warm brownish tone of Südländerin, lined
them on a snow-white in between, with a brighter face, as if the
Pompadour from the boring beyond in her beloved Paris returned.

Sometimes they stood up and slowly steps up and down, their clothes
were quickly, as if shimmering salamanders through dense foliage
slipped, even the provocative clip-folding of high heels their silk
shoes sounded intervening in their jewels broke hundreds of colored
lights, clouds stupefying fragrance pulled behind them.

They were like exotic flowers from foreign forests. The music went
through in waltz melodies. And through the open doors came gradually
the men from the bar - old and young old. Fasting, listless, like the
racehorse trainer, she mustered the women. They awoke to life only when
the champagne in the glasses before them drips.

Their eyes were too lascivious grasping, their laughter was common.

They appeared as crude barbarians captured queens compared. And now
the violins began to cheer, faster and faster the glasses were filled
and emptied again, the pairs swang in racing dance - then lowered a
Graubart the trembling knees in front of a young beauty, and drank
from her white silk shoes. "Well ?! "vulture questioningly turned
to me. I jerked the armpits, "Name the bacchantische Lust? If only men
drunk in order for women's beauty to inflame, and women only by the
noise of their eyes and their senses umnebelt, the revulsion over these
men to overcome property? "We went. About Boulevards pushed and pushed
to the crowd: strangers with tense trains everywhere outrageous
revelations of sin expecting little humble province of women with
a prostitute liable sparkle in their eyes, children, pale and nights,
are still selling flowers, the old half-knowing glance jealous of the
geschminkten womanizing, who as idols by the dark masses moving. Was
not Paris but the same? * * * * * When we next morning the meeting
of the International Congress entered, I was already alarmed at the
door are: the raged and screamed, whistled and tramples, as should be
a sensational piece to be the case. Vandervelde, leader of the Belgian
people, stood on the rostrum, but neither his authority nor the sonorous
sound of his beautiful voice, nor the incantatory gestures of his
hands were aristocratic master of the unleashed passion of the
crowd.

Impending reckten fists up to him: "À bas les ministériel," it
sounded in the bar from one side, where is Jules Guesde, French Liebknecht,
the followers Scharten. Who knew it not before, it was given to this
Assembly: Only a cardinal question of socialism was such a struggle
Wüster entbrennen. The representatives of the old revolutionary idea
steadfastly asserted their Intransigenz: "The liberation of the
worker can _nur_ a work of the working class itself, any pact with the
civil society is a betrayal of the cause of the proletariat." From this
succinct, each worker brain easily einzuprägenden rates that they
necessarily condemned the entry of the Socialists Millerand in the
Ministry and demanded from Congress a formal recognition of their
position.

Opposition Vandervelde, resolution of the mediation had defended the
Germans, the Italians rose Ferri; schönheitstrunkenen the novels
already cheered his mere appearance, and when he, with all the classic
words of the revolution juggling as a clever player pocket with shiny
crystal balls, and the revisionism Landtagswahl the participation of
the Germans to the French Ministerialismus as a waste branded,
thanked him buzzing applause.

The graceful Frenchwomen on the spectator stands, which the Congress
gave the same nerve stimulation as a Première, beat the enthusiastic
weißbehandschuhten hands together, and the speaker darker look
gratefully greeted the silky rushing defenders of capitalism, against
whom he also had called the fight.

Then came Jaurès, the modern republican France in the Dreyfus against
clericalism and militarism had defended - a figure set in, with
the broad head of a blond Teutons. He will have a hard time, I thought
given to this Assembly, the speaker their aesthetic value seems to be.
But at the first sound of his voice drew the crowd in its spell:
it was like the sea, even if she seemed calm, was in her storm, and
when it swelled, it was thundering against the walls, like the waves
against the rocks.

I was unable to the words to make sure I heard only the sound, those
musical tone of the language, the nature of the whole people,
reveals a people, the scientific conclusions by logical deduction
never able to be convinced, if not the artist him by the beauty of
form, by the pathos of the expression is packed, a people, which I
suddenly understood that it is storming the Bastille and Napoleon
Bonaparte to his emperor was crowned. as I was still dazed when we left
the room at night . At the door greeted us our fellow countrymen. "An
incredible company," railed one. "For nothing is guaranteed: not
even a pencil and paper can be found on the tables." - "And no way to
print the applications in time to leave," he added a second, - 'we know
not times where you should eat Jehn , "growled a third. Now, I felt
again in Germany. We entertain us as we zusammensaßen, about the
German resolution. "She is made of ifs and buts together, and one
case Millerand the door is closed, but opened the window," - räsonierten
the representatives of the sixth berliner constituency for which the
occurrence of a socialist in a bourgeois ministry not tactical,
but a fundamental question was. » 'The conquest of the governmental
power can not be done piecemeal,'" read stirnrunzelnd one of the
leaders of revisionism, "this is a sentence we can not sign, because
in parliamentary ruled states can not and will not otherwise than
gradually go ahead. "In the morning it agreed with the Germans
still closed for the resolution to ensure the unity of the party
to be documented, and it thereby secured its adoption.

I was glad that I had no mandate, because the discipline of our
comrades vielgerühmte me mißfiel the personal opinion of the will
of the majority subdued and the individualistic attitude of the
French seemed to me a proof of greater inner strength to be. I expressed
my view, as we work with our close friend the night before a
Boulevard Café zusammensaßen, and met with fierce opposition.

"Our discipline has made us great," bade it from all sides. »Numeric
great - certainly," I replied, "but according to whether or not
influential? In England, where the party is torn so as here, the socialist
idea pervades all circles are socialists all public authorities
in France based on the Socialist Republic, and a single socialist
minister is able, in months, more reforms in the areas protection of
the workers carry out than its predecessors for decades - "" And
in Germany the Reichstag took our group in the fight against the
Lex Heinze and saved the leadership of science and art unheard
gagged, "I broke one of the vivid present," it's slow for us but
it is, and even the resolution to be adopted by us so you pay is a
sign of progress.

She has the wrong radicalism canceled one of its peaks by the tactics
of political action. "" It seems to me, the relationships radicals and
revisionists always readily oblige. The disclosure of personal
conviction was unnecessary, "I replied." So do you think it is better
if you order from different views verzankte children's sake as to the
right and left running apart?

"" It seems to me, at least correct when yawning contrasts with rotten
boards of mutual concessions to try to bridge. "One was a momentary
silence, then looked expectantly at the vulture, which has just been
hinzugetreten." Politics is made concessions, "he said and
stressed equanimity the ash from his cigar," but that their wives
do not understand . For the business you are either too good or
too bad, so let your fingers like this.

Incidentally - I have a message in the bag that the wishes of Comrade
Brandt will receive: Your new Prophet, Bernstein, in Germany
will be happy persona. "From all sides with questions about the how
and why assails, rode with a vulture mocking glance at me in his
report continued: "The German government hopes to split the party.

It is Bülows, the new Reich Chancellor, the first heroic deed, if he
expulsion decree against Bernstein no longer repeated. Good luck to
this growth, your love German Reich, "thus, he is fleeting greeting.

We went silent after house, my husband and I, in our small furnished
apartment, which after a long search we finally had found. I felt at
home this clearer than ever that we are also gradually inwardly and
not side by side with each other went. In the night I heard how
restless he threw back and forth, and saw in the lantern light, the
mat through the window panes penetrated as zerquält its trains were.
He suffered, - and I knew not why, I, I stood next to him, had
left him alone! The heart is krampfte me.

Those women were not really the best, who had not want to be
open at all times as a container for the pain and the struggles of the
husband? Perhaps they were the lowest condition of its power. "Heinz,"
I whispered timidly and grabbed his hand, "why do not you talk to me?
- Something weighs on you --. "He smiled at me. "Good child, - you
do not be troubled! You have enough with yourself to do and with
your work. "" You, however, take part in fact - you are helping
me, and I should not help you be?

- Is it at the end related to the archive that you become inwardly're
unfaithful? "I urged." How do you know? "He went on." But I have eyes
in the head - I can see how often you make the corrections impatient
to throw - "" You're right, "he replied," I would just like you
with my affairs spared, as long as it myself so unclear. When I
launched Archive, was the social policy undeveloped farmland.

Now that the seed was up, anyone can Garben cut - "I understand," I broke
him vividly, "we both belong to those who create the paths, but not
the stones that can karren." "Ways to create -- "he repeated," quite
right! And this is in the party is now the time has come. Awful,
given this task hands tied to have! The revisionism lacks a spiritual
center, an independent body, the body of mere negation of the ideas
of practical policy in the minds of the masses hammers, the
intellectual forces of the intellectuals in the service of our cause
attracts. The Lex Heinze has it from the sleep awakened - and
here would have to be forged iron while it is warm. "" And why
are you tied to their hands? "I called, from the idea that he, was
packed. "The plan must be executed!" "With all your cleverness, but
you're a very stupid Katzel," he said.

"Or get a corn grows on the flat hand? No bourgeois publishers
would help him realize a publishing party and certainly not ... "I
thought of the American Garrison, his idea of the liberation of
slaves journal devoted himself wrote and printed. Whether we could
follow this example? My husband laughed me out. "Even if our entire
workforce of the case would sacrifice without pecuniary resources
hülfe nothing. I see only one way to get to the goal - "He broke
that he had already said too much." The mistake? "" The sale of the
archive. The proceeds could be the newspaper launch - "" Why do not you
try? "I am annoyed that he had only a moment to hesitate. He looked
at me researching. "Is this bravery or recklessness, what you talking
about? - With the sale of the archive is the safety of our existence
divulged. We may be the new company will lose everything - "" I am
not a moment in doubt, "I replied seriously." But it seems to me
compared to the size of the task are personal concerns are not
insignificant. "We were unanimous. From now on, my husband, devoted all
his free time the realization of his idea. He met with German publishers
in sales negotiations, and if I have given their repeated
Resultatlosigkeit was often close to it, the courage to lose, it
seemed with each of his failure to re-grow.

He turned to the better known revisionists, and if their faltering
responses depressed me, so it only increased his energy. And my love,
under the gray ash of everydayness just quietly geglimmt had glowed,
as the forest fire in the storm. The more I use the superiority of his
will felt, the more I loved him. And normally, my own experience to
be regarded as a scientific researcher of the experiment, from which
he draws some general conclusions, I saw that one of the theories of
modern women's movement, given the experience once again proved as
empty construction. "That developed mentally, spiritually
differentiated woman is the prerequisite and condition of deeper and
lasting relationships between the sexes, "was my old opponent, Helma
Kurz, even recently in her own swollen style magazine announced
its readers. They identified love and friendship, because they - the
lonely old girl - like the blind people of color said. Weibesliebe
is devotion to the higher person, whether the heart, she feels,
under the shirt of coarse servant or the gown of the doctor of
both laws is proposing.

That is the erotic loyalty so rare that the more the woman is mentally
and psychologically individualized. * * * * * With even greater zeal
than before, I plunged into my work, not only because the moment startled
nearer, in the I fee that would no longer spare, but even more so
because the book was completed before the new task - the magazine
of my husband - approached me. archives, libraries, employment
offices and opened up to me without difficulty.

The conscripts, their ranks closed
up by an officer, now stood like a herd of cattle in the road, about a
hundred feet distant from the escort, which was drawn up in line of
battle. Behind them stood the rear-guard of soldiers and patriots,
picked men, commanded by Lieutenant Lebrun. Hulot cast his eyes over
this arrangement of his forces and looked again at the picket of men
posted in advance upon the road. Satisfied with what he saw he was
about to give the order to march, when the tricolor cockades of the
two soldiers he had sent to beat the woods to the left caught his eye;
he waited therefore till the two others, who had gone to the right,
should reappear.

June. The ever discussed, and the concealed enemy siege of Mainz
draweth nigh because finally, you said that in his ear, now the
night Tranchée should be opened.

It was very dark, and we rode the famous road to the White Sûre hill,
you saw nothing, we heard nothing, but our horses stutzten at once, and
we were directly in front of us a little to be aware of the outgoing
train. Oestreich, soldiers dressed in gray, with gray Faschinen on the
back, then moved silently, hardly that, from time to time the sound
of beating each other hoes shovels and some suggested a nearby
movement. Wonderful and good ghosts can hardly think of a phenomenon,
which is always half-seen repeated, without clearly be seen. We
stayed at the patches hold up that they were gone, because from there
we could at least look after the place where they are in darkness and
should work.

Since similar operations are always in danger, betrayed to the enemy,
so one could expect that from the ramparts of this area, and even
if only on good luck, would be fired.

In this expectation was not long, because just at the point where
the starting Tranchée should be decreased to once a small rifle
fire going on, all incomprehensible.

If the French are herausgeschlichen, or even to our outpost
herangewagt have? We understood it not. The firing stopped, and all
sank into silence allertiefste.

Only the next morning we discovered that our own outpost on the column,
such as nursing assistants at an enemy had fired this stutzte, are
confused, each threw away his Faschine, shovels and hoes have been
saved if all the French, on the ramparts carefully made, were on
their guard, they came back without having thing, all the siege
army was in dismay. 17 June.

The French set up a battery on the road. Horrible night, rain and
storm. 18 June. When the opening of the recently unsuccessful
Tranchée discussed among the experts, wanted to find that one too far
from the fortress of the plant had remained, it was decided, therefore,
immediately, the third parallel and move closer to the fact that
accident decisive advantage drag. Man undertook it, and it was happy
place. 24 June. French and Klubisten how you could probably say
that there will be serious, organized, the growing shortage of food
is to be done against a ruthless Exportation manor house, of old and
sick, women and children who are equally cruel again rejected. The
plight of defenseless and hülfloser, between internal and external
enemies squashed people went through all the terms.

It is not omitted, Oestreicher the curfew to hear what all the
others the whole allied army exceeded. 25 June afternoon, a violent,
incomprehensible to all gunners at the end of our left wing; least
clarified what was on, the firing was on the Rhine, where the Dutch
fleet off Ihro manoeuvrer Majesty the King; Höchstdieselben were
therefore Elfeld gone. 27 June.

Beginning of the bombing, which was set alight Dechanei immediately.
Was successful the night of the assault on our Weissenau and the
hill above the monastery, admittedly vital points, the right wing of
the second parallel to secure. 28 June night. Continued bombardment of
the cathedral, tower and roof, and burn many houses around.

After midnight, the Jesuit church. We saw on the hill before Marie
Born on this terrible show, it was the sternenhellste night, the bombs
seemed to sky lights to compete, and there really were moments
where we both could not be distinguished.

New to us was climbing and falling balls of fire, because if they
were flat with a circular arc to reach the sky threatened to be
bent in a certain amount parabolically together, and the rising
Lohe soon announced that they reach their destination known.

Mr.

Gore and the Council Krause artistically treated the incident and made
so many fire studies, that they later succeeded in a translucent
piece of night to manufacture, which is still present and, most
enlightened, more than any word description of the idea of a glowing
unfortunate capital of the country able to transmit wants to be.

And how not indicated such a sight on the saddest situation by
ourselves to save us some reestablish access to such funds had! 29
June. Already long ago was a floating battery of speech was, what,
when Ginsheim built on the Main header and the first lying islands
and floodplains are filled and they should be. We talked so much
that they eventually became forgotten.

On my usual afternoon after riding on our hill, I was hardly Weissenau
there from when I on the river a large movement remarked: French
barges rowed hard after the islands, and the battery Oestreich,
created by the river until there best range, fired disrupted bounce
shot into the water, - for me a whole new drama.

As the ball for the first time on the movable element aufschlug,
arose from a strong, many feet in height bäumende Jump wave, which
had not yet collapsed, even as a second in the amount taken was
strong as the first, but not of the same height , and so came the
third, fourth, is also decreasing, until it was last against the
barges arrived, the area is continuing and vehicles accidentally
became dangerous.

At this drama could 'I do not see enough of, because it followed
on shot shot, again and again powerful new fountains, however, the old
has not had quite noisy. All at once broke up over there on the right
bank of shrubs and trees, a strange machine going, a vierecktes,
large, from local swam timbered beams, therefore, to my great
surprise, to my joy at the same time that I take this key, so much
discussed Expedition eyewitness should be.

My blessings wishes, however, seemed not to work, my hope did not
last long, because even soon turned to the mass itself, we saw
that they obeyed no rudder , the electricity was always turning it
with them.

On the hill above the Rhine and in the same manor house, everything
was in motion, hundreds of Frenchmen on the shore ran up and seduced
a huge clamor jubilation when this Trojan horse ocean, away from
the intended target of the headland, through the main inflowing
taken between now and the Rhine and Main left and dahinfuhr
unstoppable.

She drew the flow unbehülfliche machine against this manor house,
where they stranded ohnfern the bridge of the ship on a flat, even
überströmten from the river bottom.

Here now gathered all the French people of war, and as I have with my
excellent telescope the whole event is observed on the most accurate,
so I saw now, unfortunately, the trapdoor, which closed this room,
fall down and blocked it out and in captivity hiking. There was an
annoying sight: the case was not enough to bridge to dry land, the
small garrison had therefore only to wade through the water, the
circle until they reached their opponents.

There were sixty-four man, two officers and two guns, they were well
received, then to Mainz and most recently into the Prussian substitutions
brought to camp. After my return I will not failed to take advantage
of this unexpected event message to give, nobody want to 'believe, as
I even my eyes had not dared. Random Ihro were Royal Highness the
Crown Prince to the Duke of Weimar Gezelter, I was called and had
to narrate the incident, I did it exactly, but reluctant, knowing
that the bottom of the Hiobspost always something of the guilt of the
accident, the he says, to be maintained. Among the delusions of some
kind to us in unexpected events in a very unusual condition may be,
there are even many who are the only one at the moment waffnen can.
I was in the evening without the least impulse to the usual path to the
White Sûre ridden hill, the road went through a little deeper, where
neither water nor marsh, nor ditch, nor any obstacle to notice it;
on my return was the night caved, and when I just at that
depth hereinreiten wanted, I saw a black line to draw, which is
different from the brown earth verdüsterten sharp section. I
need 'it for a pit stop, but how a gap in the short time ago on
my way should be withdrawn, was not understandable.

I was therefore nothing left when it started to ride. When I came closer,
it remained in the black strips unverrückt, but it seemed to me before
the same lot, and resist to move, and soon I was called immediately
and found myself among the well-known cavalry officers. It was the
Duke of Weimar regiment, which, I do not know for what purpose
ausgerückt, at this depth was set as long as the line of black horse
appeared to me as well, which my Fupfad cut. After mutual greetings,
I then ran unimpeded to the tents. And that was after the calamity of
a boundless inner city, outside and in the region, rise to become
a lot like. The Weissenau hill on which the beautiful overview
granted every day of each visit, which differs from the situation
and make a word, what in the wide circle overseeable significant,
wanted to say, was on Sundays and public holidays, the assembly of
an innumerable amount of people who from the neighborhood herbeigezogen.

This hill, the little Frenchman harm: High Shots were very uncertain and
usually went away drüber. When the guard plate on the chest
protection, and to resist large, noted that the French hieher facing
the gun abfeuerten, so she cried: "Buck!" ward and then by all within
the battery people are expected to put themselves on their knees to
the face as throwing down to the chest defense against an incoming
ball low to be protected. Now it was Sunday and public holidays should
be fun, if a large quantity TRIMMED peasant people, often
with a prayer book and rosary, from the church take the hill
filled to umsahen, talking and schäkerten, but once on the plate Guard
"Buck!" and she cried all flying in front of this highly-dangerous
niederfielen dignified appearance and a vorüberfliegendes-divine
beings sausendes worship seemed, but soon faded back aufrafften danger
to alternately mocked and soon thereafter, when the besieged just
popular again niederstürzten. Man, this drama could very easily
provide, if you look at the next level a little sideways except
the direction of the ball was in this wonderful crowd and saw the
ball itself vorbeisausen heard.

But such a jump on the ball failed to go away no purpose nor intention.
On the backs of these heights was the way from Frankfurt ago, so that
the procession of carriages and Chaise, riders and pedestrians from
Mainz very well observed, and thus both the hill and the pilgrimage
ends in horror was set. It has also been some attention at the entrance
of the military such a quantity even soon banned, and the Frankfurter
took some detour, where they go unnoticed and unmatched in the
headquarters arrived. At the end of June. - In a restless
night, I amused myself aufzuhorchen on the manifold near and far sounds
excited, and could accurately differentiate the following: "Werda!"
plate guard in front of the tent. "Werda!" Item of the infantry.
"Werda!" as the round came from. outward and cons of going to the
plate guard. clatter of sabers on the spur. barking of the dogs away.
growl of the dog close. crowing of roosters. scratching the horse. snort
of the horses. Häckerlingschneiden . Sing, Diskurieren people
and squabble. cannon thunder. roar of cattle. cries of mule. * *
* * * gap.

That such a mind here, would like its no wonder. unglücksträchtig was
every hour, every moment you cared for his honorable Prince, for the
dearest friends, you forgot to think about their own safety. From
the wild, wild danger dressed like the look of a rattlesnake, one
crashed into the fatal unberufen rooms, and went, rode through the
Tranchée, let the Haubitzgranten roaring over your head shatter the
rubble next to fall down, sometimes you wish Schwerblessierten early
redemption of fierce suffering, and the dead man had not been recalled
to life. As defenders and attack but now stood against each other,
which would in general are so much to say. The French had to
threaten danger to provide timely and before the major works of art
also smaller jumps created pursuant to the blocking ends in a certain
distance to keep the siege, but more difficult. All of these obstacles
had to be removed when the third parallel opened, continued and should
be closed, as in the following is recorded separately. But we,
however, with a few friends, although without Ordre and occupation,
we went to the most dangerous items. Weissenau was in German
hands, but also the downstream is already conquered hill, we visited
the ruined city, held in the aftermath Gebeinhause of abnormal bone,
what the best already in the hands of the Wundärzte liked reached.
By now, but the balls of Karl hill always in the remnants of roofs and
walls suggested, let us by a local man of the Sentry, against a tip
to a known major body, where with some care to do much more
than was shown. It was with caution through rubble and debris, and
was finally stopped stone spiral staircase up to the Balkonffenster
a detached gable, which is certainly in times of peace to the owner
the best view to have had. Here we saw the confluence of the Main and
Rhine stream, and therefore the Main and Rhine tip, the lead-Au, the
fortified manor house, the ship's bridge on the left bank and then
the beautiful city: Failed spiers, incomplete roofs, smoking bodies
inconsolable sight.

Our guide said cautiously, only one window to the pole herumschauen
because of the Karl-jump her like a bullet would fly, and annoyances
he would arrange to have such.

Not satisfied with this one slipped further against the nunnery, where
it admittedly wild looked enough, where the bottom of the vaults for
bargain wine gift, however, the balls from time to time rattling
roofs perforated. But still drove the inquisitive man crept into the
last hill of the right wing, which is directly above the ruins of
the Favorite Charterhouse and deep into the glacis of the fortress
was now entrenched behind a rampart of Schanz baskets to a few
hundred paces cannonballs moved, while it admittedly it arrived,
the others who set up the first silence was lucky.

Here, I found it now, honestly confessed hot enough and you took it
not amiss, if any of that burst cannon fever again wanted to
excel, we are now pushed back, as we had come, but returned when
the opportunity and the occasion was back in the same danger.

Considering now that such a state where you are, the fear übertäuben,
each suspended destruction, for three weeks, so you will forgive us
if we have these terrible days as an ardent land rush over to try. *
* * * * 1st July was the third work in parallel and then the battery

Standstill on both sides, and holiday delights, the Frenchman, in Paris

From the main peak on the main one was the Benedictine monastery

On the other hand, ignites the laboratory and flies into the air.
Windows, shutters and chimneys of the town side break and fall
together. On 15 July we visited Mr. Gore in small winter home and
found Krause Council employs a portrait of the good friend to paint
what he did probably succeeded. Mr. Gore had attracted handsome,
princely table in order to appear if he has already settled in
this area would again have around. Now he sat, surrounded by all kinds
of house and field equipment in the chamber of a German peasant village,
on a crate, the Sugarloaf posted on a paper beside him; he held
the coffee cup in one hand, the silver Reißfeder, instead of the
spoon, in the other hand, and so was the Englishman of the very
decent and comfortable even in a bad Kantonierungsquartier presented,
as it gives us even more pleasant daily reminder in mind is.

If we have this friend allhier do, so we do not miss, a little
more about him say.

He was very happy in the camera obscura and had land and sea as well,
in this way the most beautiful memories collected. Now he could,
in Weimar resident, agility angewohnter not abdicate, has always
been inclined to travel to be small, but because it usually Krause

the above landscapes brought to paper, shaded, colored, and
so both worked for the bet. The siege of Mainz, as a rare, important
case, where the accident itself picturesquely to be promised, lured
the two friends also from the Rhine, where they behaved no idle
moment. And so they escorted us because also on a Gefahrzug after
Weissenau, where Mr. Gore particularly liked. We visited the cemetery
again, in hunting of pathological bones, a portion of the wall turned
to Mainz was inserted, it was free on field after the city. Hardly
noticed, but on the ramparts, a living thing in this room, then
shot them with bullets bounce after the gap, now saw the ball bounce
several times and dust come staggering, because it is because last
stand behind the heart or into the wall to save Gebeingewölbe knew
and the churchyard durchrollenden Ball Fair lookups. The repetition
of such a pleasure seemed to concern the valet, who, to life and limb
of his old gentleman concerned, we all spoke the conscience and the
bold Society urged to retreat. The 16th July was my bänglicher
day, and distressed me, the prospect of the next dangerous night
my friends, so it is behaved as follows. One of the most advanced enemy
small hills, before the so-called Welschen hill, made entirely their
duty, it was the biggest obstacle our front Parallel and had what it
cost wants to be taken away. On the other hand was now nothing to
say, but it showed a questionable circumstance. On message, or
assumption: the French were behind this hill, and under the
protection of the fortress cavalry camp, wanted to get to this
training and also cavalry raid with them.

What the hot: the Tranchée out directly in front of the cannons of
the hill and the fort, cavalry, and to develop itself in gloomy
night, so the hostile occupied Glacisstrasse herumzutummeln, everyone
will find understandable, but to me it was highly bänglich, Mr von
Oppen, a friend of my first plant from the regiment, commanded
to know about this.

"Double-quick, march!" cried Hulot to his men, "open your compasses
and trot the steeds faster than that! Are your legs frozen?"

These words drove the little troop into a rapid motion.

"There's a mystery, and it's hard to make out," continued Hulot,
speaking to his friends. "God grant it isn't explained by muskets at
Ernee. I'm very much afraid that we shall find the road to Mayenne cut
off by the king's men."

             *     *     *     *     *

The strategical problem which troubled the commandant was causing
quite as much uneasiness to the persons whom he had just seen on the
summit of Mont Pelerine. As soon as the drums of the National Guard
were out of hearing and Marche-a-Terre had seen the Blues at the foot
of the declivity, he gave the owl's cry joyously, and the Chouans
reappeared, but their numbers were less. Some were no doubt busy in
taking care of the wounded in the little village of La Pelerine,
situated on the side of the mountain which looks toward the valley of
Couesnon. Two or three chiefs of what were called the "Chasseurs du
Roi" clustered about Marche-a-Terre. "I already noticed, Max," said
the sister, "that you secretly with WISI do and have no sympathy with
the loyal Andres, which is almost the heart has pulled that
WISI for him was lost." "But but, assured his uncle, "I can feel him
after how unhappy he was. But further, how went the WISI? It has
but his eyes do not tear funny?" "But, I think so," drove the sister
continued . "I did not WISI more often seen, it had much to do. I
believe the man was not just bad, but he had little raw, he was
so rough and unfriendly, even with his small children.

WISI certainly had little joy more. It had several nice children, but
they were all very soft, she lost it again one after the other.

Five have had it buried, only one is left to him, a fine, delicate
little creature, a little Wiseli.

It is not much bigger than our Miezchen and is a good three years older.
Wisis health through it all had suffered so that we could clearly
see what would come.

And now it is there, a quick rafft wasting her life. I'm afraid there
is no hope. "" No! " Uncle Max cried out terrified. "This can not
be, it's really true? Can not do anything because you, Marie? We
want to be like to see, perhaps even to help."

"Oh no, there's no more to help," said the sister sad. "There was not
more help. WISI was responsible for all the work and effort much
too soft." "And what does the man now?" asked Uncle Max "Oh, I have
quite forgotten, which had the ill WISI even durchzumachen. It
will soon be a year since he was in the factory arm and a leg so
shattered that he was half - brought home.

Then he could no longer work. He has not particularly been ill
patient. WISI had him even now to cater to all others. He died then
about half a year after the accident. Since WISI lives alone with the
child. "" And so did all of nothing more than a little left Wiseli
What do you mean by that?

But no, it's so sad but have not come. WISI That can still be healthy
and everything still to come, as it should have been from the beginning
at. "" No, no, this is too late, "said the sister, very determined.
"The poor WISI has his recklessness must be hard to atone.
I'd have you know, we are making war
against the Republic, and not robbing travellers. Those who are guilty
in future of such shameful actions shall not receive absolution, nor
any of the favors reserved for the faithful servants of the king."

A murmur came from the group of Chouans, and it was easy to see that
the authority of the new chief was about to be disputed. The young
man, on whom this effect of his words was by no means lost, was
thinking of the best means of maintaining the dignity of his command,
when the trot of a horse was heard in the vicinity. All heads turned
in the direction from which the sound came. A lady appeared, sitting
astride of a little Breton horse, which she put at a gallop as soon as
she saw the young leader, so as to reach the group of Chouans as
quickly as possible.

"What is the matter?" she said, looking first at the Chouans and then
at their chief.

Führ ', which I led in the shields', directors' picture the dream of
my life, I am up there at the door! "Hardly, but he snored as Sissi him
again sang in his ear:" Louisdore and Ducats, genuine pearls, diamond,
Knights, Ihro graces, high education and intellect, wit and sharp

"Then he smiled as sweet as a pot of sour milk and replied with a
languishing voice in dreams:" Mental Health is due and not in vain,
seeing 'the dream image my life, sight ', which I led in the shields,
"I in the coat of arms on the door, from the gold bag blasonirt, curly

coat of arms in the dream was presented.

A money bag was the helmet, all sorts of papers and letters change the

paid homage to him with the jewels, a dedizirte him a book, nor was
the emblem of vigilance Sternsehenden a fat goose in front of his

At the bottom, but in the coat of arms painted winged genius of the
art itself, the most beautiful of mortals, as others would have
never managed such an original human way.

But now suddenly opened the purpurfarbichte Sammetkelch a Kaktusblüthe
and between the white silken threads dust floated a delicate maiden
with butterfly wings out to the side of the arms out, in one hand
she had a bulb plant, with the nose of the lucky touched, and in
the other she wore an antique lamp, which they lit the crest.

He called it psyche. - On the other side of the coat of arms appeared
grenadier, the rifle präsentirte .-- Ah, the good Count salt dreamed
so blessed that he almost took me, but I could not help him, I had him
the dream to help - so I turned the ring with the words: "thou

"And lo and behold, the same was ready for the ass, and the driver
was already with him, drove him with a beatings from the gazebo and
also with the two others hieher.

But I turned the ring, and wished for you to Seyn.

Since I was right here in the yard and as I have in the old
chicken coop so sue heard, I wished that the palace wants Seyn again
as it once in the highest glory in our Vorältern been, I also wish
you a beautiful people in the best years, and myself as a pretty
sensible Virgo, on the doll - like I say art figures for years to
see zürnet not dear father, but the thought of the art piece of
birch rice can now ask me to. "- laughed Gockel and said: "Gackeleia
rotating 'the ring only once, in order to be circumspect, it is
still a lot of stubborn child in the adult virgin, you still want
the Ruthe not kiss!"

- since Gackeleia kissed his hand and went on "When all of my wishes
had become to you, I crept into the henhouse and pushed me into a
corner to surprise you quite enjoy it.

Sissy wanted to but with all the violence among the doll tied Seyn
to you to awaken, as they ran through your straw and its aufriefet
"the doll!

The doll!" I said: "No dummy, it's just a beautiful art piece. ""
That Andre you know everything. "According to this narrative and
embraced Gockel Hinkel Gackeleia under the Freudenthränen and said:"
Thanks, a thousand thanks, dear child, thou shalt to thy goodness
Lohne now also on the ring finger always have, thou shalt Everything
want what you want!

" Gackeleia said: "I take it, above all, we want the three donkeys,
which are in the yard with all bepacken; what I'm good mouse king had
promised and then you shall see how wise I want to." Now they go down
and Giengen wished, after the cheese and ham to the donkey on his
back were packed, the Königsberger Marzipan, the Thornischen
gingerbread, which Jauerischen sausages, the Spandauer Zimmetbretzeln,
the Nuremberg gingerbread, Frankfurter Brent, the Saxons Kugelhupfen
Hauser, Mainzer Vitz, which Gelnhausner boys' legs, which Koblenzer
Todtenbeinchen who reads all Leckerli Botzen tents and also, which
is terminated without delay, and the donkey so depressed that she
almost broke down.

When the time came that Prince and Princess Sissi Speckelfleck farewell
wanted, turned Gackeleia Salomonis the ring with the desire, the
language of the mice to understand without a grade to sleep, and
so the entertainment was now quite easy.

Gackeleia said: "My dearest friends Highness! Does your farewell
am very sorry, we owe you everything, I want to reward you. You have
seen what can ring the Petschierstecher he transforms into ass -
so you are required to be you like it in human being, and you can
always stay here with us. "- The two mice are seriously looked at and
then erwiederte Sissi:" Gackeleia, you say a big word - but let us
remain who we are , we do not want to divide our nation, you also
wanted to use all our people to people, where would be the country
that they could grasp and eat?

o there would be murder and homicide and Hungersnoth! no, we are enough
as mice; Nothing more remains to be desired than that we came home
happy, the conspiracy Mack, Benack, Gog, Magog and demagogue with
a ton of powder in the splendid monuments Gackeleioeum find walled
in forever that we have our royal parents with all the delicious
tidbits rest, and that neither Mom nor Dad to spoil the stomach. O
the inauguration of the monument will be monumental! - o how ravishing
is Muskulus deklamiren! how sweet is the noble Piloris smell "-
there was Speckelfleck a" and how adorable the hold Marquise Marmotte
dance! "- Sissi but that, as if she heard him, and Gackeleia erwiederte:"
Sissy! you are talking very sensible, but why not ask anmuthigen young
hedgehogs, whether perhaps he would like a man Seyn, He seems
melancholy, - "I hardly think, 'returned Sissy," but I want it
thun. "As this Pfiffi Prince and Princess Sissi of her friends made
the gentlest farewell had attached the wrong ring Gockel Salomonis
the donkeys, the after it had made as a souvenir in the ear,
tacked his poodle hat on his head and sat the little mouse inside,
then left them by the driver, the three donkeys after mice hintreiben
country and lots of lovely greetings align.

When they were continuing, said Gackeleia: "Now we also want our once
in the castle chapel and see how it has changed." No sooner had
she spoken these words, as the bell to ring anfieng and she cried in
the chapel. They stepped inside and were not fed see how everything
so neat and festive with flowers and decorated Laubkränzen was. All
walls and stone images, the tomb of Urgockels and the pictures from his
life were like new, clean and polirt. It was a beautiful pulpit at the
opposite side, and an organ with a stately organ and its
Blasebalgtretern. Several small boys were ringing the bell cord from
physical forces. Another ran with water and blasting fronds sprinkled
around and that's cool sey. On one side white girls strewed
flowers on the other boys were hidden behind large bunches . But it
is not right chapel, the altar was not how to Urgockels times, there
were no lamps, no candles, no Heiligthum. Salomonis The ring had done
his best, but he can only be temporal, natural, artificial, worldly but
nothing Eternal Spiritual and type. When she sees everything with joy
were they by the sight of the cock at the tomb of Urgockels
quite vividly remembers the good Alektryo. They thought the neck court,
which held Gockel here. Ms. Hinkel and Gackeleia beating the eyes
down, as played at once the organist a very touching aria: "How
they are so soft ruhn." It was a solemn moment indeed .-- "Ah, the
noble Alektryo!" Gockel sighed, "I can not endure, "sobbed Mrs.
Hinkel," oh, he would not play because !"--" egg, "Gackeleia thought,"
I can help, "and turned quite still on her ring:" thou wise King
Solomon, the ghosts unterthänig, make my The happy parents
Alektryo Hahn; ring! Ring! rotating 'to thee, Mach quickly, I
ask' you drum. "As a clouds lifted on the spot from the ground,
where the Alektryo's bones were burned, and whirled and ballte
together and became like a cock and Uralektryo on touched the tomb
itself, stretched his neck, beat its wings and crowed pervasive, and
it drove like a fire beam from his throat to the small, sickle-cloud
down at the moment the old Alektryo was meaningful to shoulder Gockel
flew with the wings beat with knights and the stony cock crows
replied, whereupon the chicken farm outside in all Hahnen replied it
went like a shield of the guards shouts of the cock to cock crows
around.

Alektryo all joy was very great, but he himself was deep and thoughtful,
he meditirte. Now that all sides of the hens and cocks in the chapel
came into the Alektryo to see this used by the rebirth of his
shattered heart and cock Hühnergemüther, swung to the pulpit and
held up a surprisingly touching speech about family and happiness
Children breeding, so no Clavus without compassion remained below
the all sobbed and listening Federvieh beeps very quietly - the
organist accompagnirte even with a sweet melancholy aria: "Oh sister!

you certainly etc. "Even the raugräfliche family was very touched.
Alektryo When at the end of his speech, exclaiming:" is someone under
the esteemed attendees, the ceremony or wedding Verlöbniß wants to keep?
"- turned Gackeleia the ring without knowing how, and talked very
secretly, without knowing what "thou wise King Solomon, the ghosts
unterthänig, Bring forth Kronovus but the whole Sun, as suggested
by some; ring!

Ring! rotating 'to thee, Make quick, I ask' you drum. "Then suddenly
hunting horns sounded in the courtyard.

Gackeleia ran out, as if her head on fire, and saw the prince's
Kronovus in a green hunting Röckchen Chen mold of his jump, and
they flew to embrace each other with the exclamation: "Oh how are
you so big you Bück !"

--" Oh how are you so small stretch yourself!" Gackeleia but quickly
turned the ring behind the backs of Kronovus and wish that he was so
mature and sensible Seyn may, as they themselves, and lo and behold,
there he was visibly what it was a great pleasure. As they hurried
with him into the chapel, his Jagdgefolge but remained in the doors
are.

Gockel Hinkel and the Kronovus greeted warmly and said this once, because
his father, Mr. Eifrasius and his wife, mother Eilegia the time
and were blessed with death left seyen, he explained to them that, so
she hands her daughter Gackeleia wanted to give it to them his
Queen of Gelnhausen will make sey.

Theile Since all were satisfied, the parents led the young couple to
the altar flowers.

Meanwhile played the organ and sang the beautiful aria: "The most
beautiful Hirschlein on the dimensions, do not you blow the hunter?

"screamed Alektryo but three times from the pulpit:" To Verlöbniß here
to notify the Hochachtbar Wohlbestellten, Kronovus Majesty, King of
Gelnhausen, oberthänig, With the delicate Raugräfinn Gackeleia,
unterthänig, Count Gockel Gau-heiresses, Wend't Nobody was dawid
an example, they verlobet Seyn!

"No Piepswörtchen of an objection was heard, but when he asked for
the third:" Who uses what dawid Ein?

"erschallte a dull voice, all terrified," I Urgockelio say: No! "
Everything looked the picture of the Urgockels to Kronovus grimly
but his sword and screamed against the gravestone: "He's daring and
speaks a word burned?"

Urgockel but failed with the Ruthe at the stone Abc-book that it rasselte
and said that eyes like an angry schoolmaster rolling: "Just plug
me in a Flederwisch, otherwise I take you to catch the coat And
leave you with the art piece from birch rice taste quite efficient;
Do you know they do not?

the bride and ask only that you will show you how it tastes, discover
"The sudden talk of stone Urgockels was no small disturbance among
the high level of attendees and their poultry, Gackeleia hardly had
the word" art piece of broom Rice belongs, as a glowing Röth covered
her cheeks, but they are currently gathered and waved to the organist,
who's in a mirror all saw what happened at the altars, and this was
suddenly happening all pipes and made a watercolor like Paucken and
trumpets, so that the whole threat Urgockels was not heard.

However Gackeleia pulled the artificial figure, gave her a little bell
in the hand bag and left them under the present herumschnurren
chickens, but several young cocks, which not a little money with
him had fiengen about jabber and finally to argue, and a small Young
took a bomb and injected under the fronds that they wegliefen with
great clamor, to Alektryo cried continually from the pulpit, and
was warmly Gackeleia glad that you have all the spectacle, the words
Urgockels not heard Kronovus and his sword was inserted again.

When it became quiet again, called for the third Alektryo: "Nobody
Wendt dawid what an example they verlobet Seyn!"

And all eyes were present on the image which is directed Urgockels
said: "I bless your Alliance only, If you kept euern oath, in whom
you said my name, as her detention the pretzel Brachet, only then
to never leave each other, When the pieces fit gebrochnen!

"Urgockel had hardly pronounced these words, as well as Gackeleia
same from their baskets and Kronovus from his hunting bag, half of
the pretzel and the boys hervorzogen and leg together, and the
pieces fit together as sharp as if they are broken now .-- You would
not apologized that their vows in the joy of the reunion had
forgotten, but they were the words Urgockels roth up over the ears
and looked quite silly to go out because they felt ashamed.

At this solemn act was a general silence, we heard nothing but
ringing the bell at the bag, the figure herumtrug art.

Urgockel stone but stretched out his hand and blessed Kronovus and
Gackeleia with the words: "As the two halves, one separate from
the others, none, And in your heraldic shields Should Myrthenkranz
in a golden box in your show, Glossy, unharmed and intact, pretzel
and boys' legs For memory later grandchildren. Two mice crowned

Alektryo crows on the throne and crown a strong nest forbid, what
Ms. Gallina breed. On the count crown edge floating 'in a purple robe,
lifting with the small hand of Fortune High pledge, Salomonis seal
ring, That love marvel, No doll, just a nice art figure! "
exclaimed Marche-a-Terre.

He gave a signal and a shower of bullets riddled the turgotine. At
this unexpected volley the old vehicle gave forth such a lamentable
cry that the Chouans, superstitious by nature, recoiled in terror; but
Marche-a-Terre caught sight of the pallid face of the silent traveller
rising from the floor of the coach.

"You've got another fowl in your coop," he said in a low voice to
Coupiau.

"Yes," said the driver; "but I make it a condition of my joining you
that I be allowed to take that worthy man safe and sound to Fougeres.
I'm pledged to it in the name of Saint Anne of Auray."

"Who is he?" asked Pille-Miche.

"That I can't tell you," replied Coupiau.

"Let him alone!" said Marche-a-Terre, shoving Pille-Miche with his
elbow; "he has vowed by Saint Anne of Auray, and he must keep his
word."

"Very good," said Pille-Miche, addressing Coupiau; "but mind you don't
go down the mountain too fast; we shall overtake you,--a good reason
why; I want to see the cut of your traveller, and give him his
passport."

We gave each other alternately so much intelligence, as every popular,
and as we have just blessing accompanied by reversed wanted, met Sömmering
that his call ours established, familiar faces found themselves
amused and confidential disappeared last before us we may versahen,
but we stopped for time to reverse. same desire, same desire to
feel a number of emigrant, who, with victuals which, until the outer
works, then in the fort itself intrude understood to Abandoned again
to hug and to rest.

We encountered several such passionate hikers, and liked it so much
this state, that finally, after double post, the strictest ban started,
the ramparts, to approach the communication was suddenly interrupted.
On 23 July. This day went under foreign occupation of the works both
as of Mainz Kastel. In a slight Chaise I made a trip in such a tight
circle around the city, as it allows the suspended guards wanted.
We visited the Tranchée and besah reached after the end abandoned
groundwork useless.

When I substantially, called me a middle-aged man and asked me to
his boys about eight years, he's hand with fortschleppte to me to
take.

He was an expatriate from Mainz, who, with great haste and lust leaving
his previous residence, herbeilief, the extract of the enemies
should triumphantly, but then abandoned the Klubisten death and
vowed to bring destruction.

I talked to him begütigende words and presented to him before: that
the return to a peaceful state of domestic and not with a new civil
war, hatred and revenge must be polluted because the accident
otherwise perpetuate.

The punishment of those guilty people must be allied to the high
and the true ruler after his return on leave, and what else I
pacifying and seriously mentioned, which I had a right, by getting
the child in the car and both took a drink of good wine Bretzeln
and refreshed.

At one place abgeredeten sets I settled the boy, because as the
father from afar, and showed me with the hat thousand thanks and
blessings zuwinkte. 24 July. The morning was pretty quiet out of
Ausmarsch delayed, it should be money-related matters that can not be
dismissed as soon could.

Finally at noon, when everything at the table and pot busy and a great
silence in the camp and on the road was dreispännige drove several
cars, at some distance from each other, very quickly, without
having one's versah and over nachsann, but soon spread Rumor: this bold
and wise way would have several Klubisten be rescued. Passionate people
argued that we should put after other annoyances when it could move,
others wanted to be surprised: that on the whole way no trace of
guard, yet Pikett still seemed supervision, which shed light, they
said that they come from above through the finger to see and
everything that could happen, the chance to leave is tilted.

These considerations, however, were the real extract interrupted and
umgestimmt. Here, too, came to me and friends, the windows of the
house Chaussee zustatten. The train we saw in all its solemnity
approaching. Led by the Prussian cavalry, followed by first the
French garrison.

Strange was nothing but how this train announced, and a column
Marseillais, small, black, variegated, paltry dressed Trapp were
approached, as if King Edwin of his mountain opened, and the lively
Zwergenheer emitted.

This was followed by regular troops, serious and sullen, but not
around dejected or ashamed. When the strange phenomenon on the other
hand, had anyone noticed when the hunters on horseback heraufritten
they were very quiet until used against us, as their music Marseillais
anstimmte march.

This revolutionary _Te Deum_ has already somewhat sad, full punishment,
even if it is carried forward so boldly, but this time they took
the pace very slow, creeping to the step under which they denied.

It was poignant and durchtbar a serious and sight, as the horse,
long gaunt men of some years, the mine is also in accordance with
those tones, approaches, individually they would have to compare
Don Quixote, in the mass appeared highly venerable.

Noteworthy was a single squad, the French Kommissarien. Merlin of
Thionville in hussar dress, with wild beard and look to reward, had
a different character in the same costume next to the left, the
nation cried with anger, the name of a Klubisten and moved to attack.

Merlin stopped, stood on his dignity of a French representative on
the revenge that insult everyone should follow: he wanted to advise,
to moderate, because it was not the last that we see him here.

The crowd was concerned, no individual dared before. He had some of
our officers approached and left on the floor of the King called,
and so nobody wanted neither attack nor defense dare, the train
went over untouched. 25 July.

             On the morning of that day remarked 'I do that again, unfortunately,
no signs on the road and its vicinity were made in order to prevent
disorders.

They seemed all the more necessary today, when the poor expatriate,
boundless unfortunate Mainzer, from distant places her now arrived,
scharenweis the road surrounded by revenge and curse words and the
tortured heart geängstigte relief. Yesterday the Kriegslist therefore
not succeeded in escape again. Individual car travel again hurriedly
ran towards the road, were everywhere but the citizens of Mainz in
the road ditch stored, and how the fugitive escaped an ambush they
fell into the hands of others.

The car was stopped, they found French or French, so they could
escape, by no means well-known Klubisten.

A very nice car rolls dreispänniger travel, therefore, a friendly
young lady does not fail to see the stroke, and on both sides to
greet, but Postillion which one falls into the bridle, the blow
will be opened, an ore-klubist at her side immediately recognized.

Be denied, he was not just built dicklich, wide view, blatternarbig.
Already he has been ripped out at the feet, one excludes the impact
of beauty and wished a happy journey.

But it drags you to the next field, and pounds zerprügelt him terribly,
and all members of his body is shattered, his face unrecognizable.
A guard takes his last example, you can place it in a farmhouse, where
he was lying on straw in his assault against the enemy city, but
not before Schimpf, gloating and revile was protected.

But even so in the end it went so far that the officer no longer
hineinließ, even me, he is a friend not as an outlier would
urgently asked: I want this disgusting and saddest of all spectacles
abdicate.

On the 25th July.

On the road home, we employed the now distant periodic statement
of the French.

I was standing with Mr. Gore daselbst at the window below, gathered
a large quantity, but in the spacious square, the observer could
not miss.

Infantry, well-educated lively line troops, now came up; Mainzer
girls went with them, sometimes alongside, sometimes within the limbs.
Your friend, they welcomed with head and ridicule speeches: "Oh,
maiden Lizzie wants you in the world?" and then: "The soles are still
new, they will soon be passed through!" also: "Did you even when
French? - Luck on the trip!"

and so was always continued by those Ruten tongue, but the girls
all seemed cheerful and confident, some wanted their neighbors to
live well, most were silent and looked at her lover.

Meanwhile, the nation was very moved, swear words were expelled by
violent threats support. The wives of the men censured, that this
not worthy so let pass, which in its bundle certainly many of goods
and chattels of a true citizen of Mainz dragged with them, and only
the serious step of the military, the organization received through
nebenhergehende officers prevented an outbreak the passionate
movement was awful.

It is precisely in this most dangerous moments seemed a train, which
is certainly far hinweggewünscht had.

Without bizarre cover showed a man on horseback wohlgebildeter whose
uniforms are not just a military announced, at his side rode in
wohlgebautes dress a man and a very beautiful woman room behind
them followed by some vierzpännige car with boxes and boxes packed,
and the silence was ahndungsvoll.

Suddenly roars' in the nation, and cried: "Hold him! Strike him dead!
Spitzbube That is the architect of the first Domdechanei looted and
set alight has even afterwards!" it came to a single determined person,
and it was done.

Without further to superior than that of the castle before the peace
of the Duke neighborhood, not least should be, with the lightning-quick
idea of what the prince and general in its Nachhausekunft would say
if he on the debris of such a Selbsthülfe barely could reach his
door, I jumped down, and cried out with non-voice: "Stop!"

It was closer to the people out, although the Schlagbaum unterfing
nobody herabzulassen, but the road itself was the Quantity blocked.

I repeated my "Stop!" and the most perfect silence entered.

I drove it very strongly and continued speaking: here is the neighborhood
of the Duke of Weimar, the square in front of it is sacred, and when
they get up to mischief and driving practice wanted revenge, so
they would have enough room.

The King had allowed free extract, if he had this condition and
want to exclude certain people, he would Wardens employed or dismissed
the perpetrators are captured, but nothing like this was known, no
patrol to see.

And she, who and how they can also be had in the middle of the
German army, no other role to play as a spectator to remain quiet,
their unhappiness and their hatred here give them no right, and I
suffered for all of these Job no violence. Now astonished the people,
was silent, then undulates' again, grumbled, scolded, were fiercely
individual, a couple of men penetrated before the horse in the reins
to fall.

Oddly, one of them that wig-maker, I already warned yesterday that
I may show him good. - "What!" I called him, "Have you already forgotten
what we talked yesterday, together?

Have you not thought about that one by self revenge is guilty, that
God and his superiors, the punishment of criminals should be left
as they are the end of this also bring misery to be had, and what
else, I brief, but spoke loudly and violently.

The man, who immediately recognized me, came back, the child clings
to the father and was friendly to me over here, was already the people
had resigned, and the free space left, even the way down the
turnpike was open again.

The two figures on horseback hardly knew to behave. I was pretty
much in place hereingetreten, the man rode up to me and said he
wished to know my name, to know whom he has such a large service
was guilty, he'll remember his life and like to reciprocate.

Even the beautiful child approached me and said the binding. I
replied that I am nothing but my duty done and the safety and sanctity
of this place would have claimed I was a Wink, and they moved to
continue. The crowd was now once in their mistaken sense of revenge,
they remained standing, thirty steps which would have prevented
anyone.

That's but in the world: those who only just over a kick-out, comes
more than a thousand. _Chi Scampa d'un punto, di scampa When I mille._
after my expedition to friend hinaufkam Gore, he called me in
his English-French opposite: "What fly stings you, you have you entered
into a trade, which was badly run." "But I was not afraid," returned
I, "and you will find not even pretty, that I did the square in front
of the house so 've kept inside? What would 'it out, if everything would
be fully debris, which annoyed everyone, passionately excited and
nobody would benefit? also like that the property does not deserve,
the comfort he has fortgeschleppt! "Meanwhile, however, the extract
of the French left passing under our window, the crowd, which no
interest was to continue, was that nothing could make it possible,
sought a way to enter the town to sneak that with him and what
their effects possibly could be rescued, again and to his delight.
More but it drove the most pardonable anger, their hated enemies,
the Klubisten and Komitisten, to punish, to destroy, as they
sometimes menacing enough exclaimed. However, my good could Gore not
satisfied that I, with its own risk for a unknown, perhaps criminal
people have dared so much. I always turned him jokingly to the pure
space of the house before last and said impatiently: "It is now in
my nature: I will prefer to commit an injustice, than tolerate disorder."
26 and 27 July. 26 We have succeeded, with some friends at horse penetrate
into the city, where we found the bejammernswertesten condition. In
rubble and debris had collapsed, which was for centuries to build,
where the most beautiful location in the world of riches provinces
and religion flowed together, what were their servants, to attach and
multiply sought. The confusion that seized the mind, was very painful,
much sadder, as if one by chance in a city being cremated. In order
dissolved the police had to be sad all the debris on the streets of
rubbish collected, traces of looting were noted in entourage inner
hostility.

Hohe threatened the collapse of walls, towers were unsafe, and what
is required of individual descriptions, because the main building
named after themselves, as in flames.

From age predilection, I hastened to Dechanei that I still have a small
architectural paradise in mind, namely, the porch columns with their
gables still upright, but I just came too soon on the rubble of the
collapsed ceilings schöngewölbten the wireframe beaten me in the
paths, otherwise the network as above enlightening window protected;
here and there was still a remnant of old grandeur and delicacy to
be seen, and so was because that model apartment forever destroyed.
All the buildings around the square had the same fate, it was the night
of 27 June, where the destruction of this beautiful area, the
enlightened. This reaches' I said in the area of the castle, which no
one dared to approach. External bretterne Angebäude pointed to the
contamination of those princely dwelling, on the square in front of
it were, pushed into one another being, useless guns, partly by the
enemy, partly through their own effort heated destroyed. As of
now by hostile outside force so many beautiful buildings its
contents have been destroyed, it was also inwardly by much crudity,
outrage and mischief underlying addressed. Ostheim The palace was
still standing in its integrity, but for Schneider hostel accommodation
to wax tubes and turns - a reversal, to be accursed! Rooms fully scraps
of cloth and then re-plaster the marble walls with large hooks and
nails zerspengt, rifles then hang around and asked.

  The academy building was from the outside yet very friendly, only
had one ball on the second floor of a Fenstergewände Quarter
Sömmerrings blown up.

  I found this friend daselbst again, I can not say confiscated,
because the rooms were beautiful with the wild guest on the worst
treated.

  They had not merely the neat blue wallpaper, so far they are able
  to spoil; leaders, asked each other or on tables and chairs,
  they had needed in order to have the room to the ceiling with bacon
or other greasiness to besmirch.

  There were the same room where we are in front of year
  to be cheerful and confidential information and mutual joke sat
together in friendship.

  However, this was evil but also to show something comforting;
  Sömmerring had his basement uneröffnet and its preparations by
then escaped undamaged found.

  We made them a visit while we are teaching conversation gave
  rise. A Proclamation by the new governor had spent . I
  found them in just the sense, almost the same words my warning
  to those expatriate wig maker, and all Selbsthülfe was forbidden;
returning to the country Mr alone should have the right respect,
between good and bad citizens to describe the difference.

  Very necessary, such a decree, because in the present resolution to
  the deadlock caused by a few days ago, penetrated the wildest
  emigrated to the city and forced even the plundering of
  Klubistenhäuser by the soldiers hereinziehenden siege led and
annoyed.

  That Regulation was the mildest expressions taken to how cheap the
  righteous wrath of the offended people boundless life. How difficult
  is it, a lot of moving back to bring peace! Even in our
  present such irregularities happened.

The soldier was in a shop, called tobacco, and by him abwog,
he took possession of the whole. On the Zetergeschrei citizens put
our resources into the officers, and so it was about an hour, on
a day of chaos and confusion remain.

On our hikes, we found an old woman at the door of a low, almost in the
ground dug cottage. We surprised us that they have returned, as we
heard that they did not emigrate, whether you like it reasonably, to
leave the city. "Even to me," she said, "are the Hans sausages come
with their brightly colored sashes, I have ordered and threatened,
but I gave them the hard truth: God will give me this poor woman in my
hut is alive and in honor, if I have long ago in disgrace, and
Schimpf will see. I bade them with their Narreteien go. They were
afraid, my screams would like to upset the neighbors, and let me
alone. And so did I all the time partly in the basement, partly
in Free to persuade me of little nourishment, and yet live to honor
God, but that it is poorly made. "Then she pointed us to an opposite
corner, to show how close the danger was. We were in the lower
corner a handsome building look into it, that was a strange sight!

  There had been many years an old collection of curiosities confessed,
figurines and picture Porzellain stone, Chinese cups, plates, bowls
and vessels, in ivory and amber liked 'it would not have missed,
as in others, carving and turning movement, from moss straw and
other composite paintings, and what you are in such a collection
might think.

  All this was just from the rubble to close, because a bomb through
  all floors powerful, was in this room burst, the violent expansion
of air by everything from inside the place threw the window herauswärts
beat them, the wire mesh, which would otherwise the interior and
now screened between the iron rod-like lattices bauch herausgebogen
appeared.

  The good wife promised that in this explosion itself was believed
  to set. We found our lunch in a large host table, with many outward
  and cons speeches seemed to us the best, to remain silent.
  Wondrous enough, it was, however, that one of the musicians present
the march and the Marseillais _Ça ira_ required, all the guests
seemed einzustimmen and exhilarated.

  For our next round Herwandern and we knew the place where the Favorite
  confessed, hardly to be distinguished. In August last year erhub
  here a beautiful garden room, terraces, Orangerie, Spring works
  made directly on the Rhine is Lustort highly amusing. Here
  the green alleys, in which, where the gardener told me to be the
most gracious Elector heads with all the wake of vast slabs
entertained, and what the good man not all of damastnen covers,
silverware and dishes had to tell.

  Linked to those memories, making the presence of only a terrible
  impression.

  The neighboring Kartause was also disappeared, because you had
  the stones of these buildings immediately to the major white Sûre
Schanze bricked.

  The nunneries Chen was still fresh and unlikely to produce ruins.
  Gore's friends and Krause I accompanied to the citadel. There
  was now Drusus' monument ohngefähr still just as I had drawn as a
boy, also this unshaken, so much fire balls vorbeigeflogen want to
be, yes it has beaten.

Mr. Gore presented his portable dark chamber on the right immediately
Walle, in intention, a drawing of the entire siege disfigured by the
city to undertake, also from the center, from the Duomo, conscientious
and just came against the sides less complete, as presented to us
in his left, beautifully arranged leaves eyes lies ahead.

Finally turned our way after manor house, on the bridge you have to
seek fresh breath of age and still be deceived for a moment, as
if that time could come again.

On the attachment of manor house had been during the siege continued
ever bricked, we found a fresh trough lime, bricks, and also an
unfinished job and we had pronounced after arrest and surrender all
stand and leave.

So strange to be sad but when was the beat around the manor house
walls, you had about the abundance of fruit trees in the local area
consumed. When the roots cut off, the outermost branches of delicate
weggestutzt, pushed the stronger you are, regularly grown crowns
together and built by an impenetrable bulwark last, it seemed at
the same time planted trees under the same favorable circumstances
arise, now hostile to use, the Downfall leave.

Lange but was able to not regret such a fact that, as host and
hostess, and each inhabitant, the man addressed, their own misery
seemed to forget to log in larger narratives of endless misery
herauszulassen in which the forced emigration of Mainz citizens
between two enemies, the inner and express themselves clamped saw.

It is not the war alone, but by the bourgeois state nonsense
resolution had such a misfortune and prepares procedures.

Somewhat recovered from our minds all the trouble and woe, in fact,
heroic narrative of some of the stalwart citizens of the city.

First we saw with horror the bombing as an inevitable misery that the
destructive violence of the balls of fire was too big to move the
accident so decided that no one thought to be able to counteract,
but finally, with the threat of known, decided to contribute her meet.
A bomb, which fell into a house with water ready to delete them,
the opportunity was too bold a joke, and one told of the wonders
of the female heroines of this kind, which are saved and others
happy.

But the demise of stalwart brave people was deplorable. A pharmacist
and his son went on the basis of this operation. If you now regret
the accident, and others wished happiness, an end to suffering,
so we are surprised at the same time that the fort was no longer
held.

In the vessels of the cathedral, whose dome itself had received,
was a large mass of uncontaminated Mehlsäcke, we spoke of other
stores and endless wine.

It had, therefore, the presumption that the last revolution in
Paris, making the party, including the Mainz Kommissarien belonged
to the regiment aufgeschwungen, actually the earlier surrender of
the fortress causes.

An enormous cravat was wound about
his neck in so many folds that the little head which protruded from
that muslin labyrinth certainly did justify Captain Merle's
comparison. The stranger also wore tight-fitting trousers and Suwaroff
boots. A huge blue-and-white cameo pinned his shirt; two watch-chains
hung from his belt; his hair, worn in ringlets on each side of his
face, concealed nearly the whole forehead; and, for a last adornment,
the collar of his shirt and that of his coat came so high that his
head seemed enveloped like a bunch of flowers in a horn of paper. Since
the coming of the deputy D. James, the father was less each day,
stopping at the home of his uncle, and therefore leaving more time
to stay lonely. The work, however, does not spread or so ahead. Rather,
the father wrote in her less than ever. Sat in his office, was placed
in front of the white book, which was spreading its ideas as it happened,
except to put them later in order as a wise and well thought-out
plan, finally took the pen, but it was all in vain . Not presented any
clear and specific to say. A sea of thoughts and feelings are shaken
in spirit, as if they came on the most violent hurricane, cards and
stirring all, where, instead of creating a harmonious, gushing
dark chaos.When the captain had dropped back close to the carriage, the dandy
seemed to fathom his design, and favored it by checking his horse.
Merle, who had flung him a sardonic glance, encountered one of those
impenetrable faces, trained by the vicissitudes of the Revolution to
hide all, even the most insignificant, emotion. The moment the curved
end of the old triangular hat and the captain's epaulets were seen by
the occupants of the carriage, a voice of angelic sweetness said:
"Monsieur l'officier, will you have the kindness to tell us at what
part of the road we now are?"

So they were without a residence fortgereist. Hans knew always
predict when again came a farmstead, where they refreshment for himself
and good fodder for the horse would find anywhere, he was known
everywhere, he was friendly, though, as it seemed to George, often
with amazement as he whispered, then usually Viertelstündchen
a house with the father while the younger housewife Knights busy and
friendly with bread, butter and pure cider up all time, and the
"Büebla" and "Mädla" high lean guest, his beautiful coat, his shiny
sash, the flowing springs of his Berets admired. Was it a small
meal eaten, had George's horse power again, so the whole house
accompanied the outgoing to the door, and the young rider was able
to shame its never the hospitality of the good people rewarded.

With defensive looks at the Pfeifer Hardt they refused to stand
firm, to his small gifts.

This puzzle led his companions do not, because his reply: "If people
come after Hardt, they also revert back to me."

Seemed only an evasive answer. The night also brought her in one of
these dispersed farms , where the housewife to make her guests
with not less willingness on the Ofenbank a bed made to cope as
they honor him on a pair of pigeons are sacrificed and a thick
porridge geschmälzten had applied.

The following day they continued their journey in the same way, only
came Georg before, as if its driver with even more caution than
go to work yesterday. Because he did, if they are a yard seam, the
rider probably five hundred steps to make it stop, is cautiously
approaching the buildings, and only after carefully ausgespäht
everything he had, he waved the Junker to follow. George asked him
for nothing, whether it is dangerous in this area is whether the federal
troops already were in the vicinity? He said nothing specific about
it. At noon, when the area was bright and the road is even more
against the country herabzog, the journey seemed to be dangerous,
because the musician Hardt seemed now no longer even close to the
apartments to but was in a yard with a bag that will feed for the horse,
and sufficient food for both of them contained. Even thought George
should be noted that they no longer pursued the same direction as
before, but very much on the right distracts. On the edge of a shady
grove book, where a clear spring and fresh grass invited to rest,
they stop. George dismounted, and his driver pulled from his bag a
good dinner. After the horse which he had, he seated himself at
the feet of the knight and started with a big appetite to access. George
had fed his hunger and looked at now with attentive eye on the area.
It was a beautiful, wide valley in which they hinabsahen.

A small river ran quickly through the fields, of which there was
limited, seemed well and diligently cultivated, in a friendly castle
stood on a hill at the other end of the valley, the whole area was
friendlier than the back of the mountain on which they were drawn.

"It seems we have the Alb leave," said the young man, he is turned
to his companions.

"This valley, the hills look far from friendly as the rock bottom
and the barren grazing grounds, which we crossed.

Even the air is blowing here milder and warmer than above, where the
winds are often so hard to touch."

"You have legally advised Junker, "said Hans, by the remnants of
their meal in the bag carefully presented.

"These valleys are part of the sub-country, and that river that you can
see, flows into the Neckar." "How comes it that we are so far
from the path distracted?" asked George. "It came to me already at
the top of the mountains, when we would leave the old direction,
but you never wanted to hear This path must be the situation as far
as I know of Lichtenstein, is much too far to the right result."

"Well, I it wants you now say, "replied the farmer," I wanted you
on the Alb do not unnecessarily anxious, but now we are, God
willing in safety. Indeed, in the worst case, we are no longer
four hours by Hardt, how to reach us nothing more to harm. "" In
Security? " George interrupted him puzzled. "Who will give us some
harm?" "Oh, the Bündischen," said the musician.

"They graze on the Alb, and often their riders were a thousand
steps more from us. I for my part, it would not have been loved in
her hands to fall, for they are to me, as you probably know, not
green. And also you would be perhaps not quite right, caught before
the Lord Truchseß to be guided. "" God will save me!

" cried the Junker.

"Before the Truchseß?

Dear, I can not kill on the spot.

What they want but here?

It is here in the vicinity of celebrations of Württemberg, and you
told me yes they do, they could move freely through the country,
which they graze? "" Look, Junker! There are bad people everywhere.
What is a right Württemberger who can pull the skin rather than
the Duke that he reveals, after which the drift Bündler now keep
hunting. But the Truchseß to be released under the hands of a whole
heap of gold which have promised, and he begins. He has his rider
ausgeschickt, this streak is now over, and people say that there
are some among the farmers who are blinded by the gold and the dogs all
the ravines and hiding show. "" After the Duke, they graze? It is
indeed fled the country, or, as others say in Tübingen in its fixed
palace, where forty knights protect him. "" Yes, forty are noble,
"replied the farmer with a clever face."

Even the Duke Söhnlein that Christopher is there, which has its
veracity. Whether the Duke himself, but there is nobody quite knows.
The trust said, as I know him, he includes only the highest in an
emergency festivals, he is a bold, restless O Lord, and it is he
comfortable in the woods and mountains, where it also has risk. "" The
Duke So they are looking for? So he would have here in the vicinity?
"" Where he is, I do not know, "replied the piper Hardt," and I wanted
to bet that nobody knows as God, but where he is, I know, "he Add Georg
and it seemed as if a ray of enthusiasm from the eye of this man
break, "where he will be when the need is greatest, where his faithful
to him to find where some faithful to the chest wall will be
to the Lord in the plight of these Bündler to protect.

Because he is a strict lord, he is nevertheless a Württemberger,
and a heavy hand, we prefer as the glistening words of Bavaria and
the Austrian. "" And if they recognize the unfortunate prince, if
they encounter him?

Has he not his figure veiled and made unrecognizable? You searched me
once described his face, and I believe him almost in front of me
to see, especially by its non-shiny eye.

But how is its shape?

"" He likes barely eight years older than you, "replied that" he is
not as big as yours, but in many ways similar to the shape you,
especially if your horse to saßet and I was behind you, as it warned
me often, and I thought: So, just so The Duke saw in the days of
his glory. "George was up to his horse to see the words of the
peasants had him worried for his safety, and he saw now, as he
acted foolishly, in this maelstrom of war itself occupied by a
country to want to steal.

It would be highly embarrassing to him was, at this moment to be
caught, although he could stay after his oath, but he wanted when
he was only in the next fourteen days, no physical part in the fight
against the federal government adopted, but he felt how light it is
adverse to him would have to throw in that region, so far from the
road to his home, taken to be, and are in the company of a man who
the federal Supreme highly suspect, even dangerous geschienen had
. reverse was not possible, because it was almost with certainty
assume that the federal troops to the entire width of the Alb had
received, the Safest seemed to hurry through the outermost post of
army hinauszukommen, you then had the danger in the back before and
next to train but free.

The otherwise spirited animal, which his master about these threats
should be taken out, hung the ears, the great rush and tiring, stone
footpaths had weakened his power, to his great annoyances even
noticed Georg that it is on the left forefoot occurred not like
what a eight-way over sharp, angular rocks was not too surprising.

The farmer noticed the embarrassment of the Junkers, who examined the
animal and advised that there are still several hours to be there
but the consolation that he was acquainted with the area so that
it is a great distance in the night could set back.

Chapter 14 The young man was in his destiny and sought distraction in
the lovely view that is still far from beautiful his eyes opened than
him, the farmer about fifty steps led higher. "A wonderful country,
this Wuerttemberg," cried George, by his eye from hill to hill
sweeps. "How brave, how lofty mountain peaks and these walls, these
rocks and their castles! And if I turn it against the valleys of the
Neckar, like those lovely rolling hills, those hills with fruit and
wine reception, those fertile valleys with streams and rivers, plus a
milder sky and a good, strong beat of people! " "Yes," was the farmer
that "it is a beautiful country, but up here it still will not say
much, but what it is at Stuttgart, the true Unterland, Lord, because
it is a pleasure, in summer or autumn at Neckar hinabzuwandeln; such
as the fields so beautiful and rich, like the vine so thick and
green covers the hills and how rafts and boat up the Neckar and
hinabfahren how people so happy at work and the nice girl sing as
the young larks!

"" Well, those valleys of the Neckar and Rems beautiful, "said
Georg," but this valley to our feet, even at these levels we have
her own quiet charm. how hot those castles on the hills?

And those faraway mountains? "The farmer sinnend overlooked the area
and pointed to the rearmost mountain wall, which the eye barely visible,
stood in the mist." There, behind, between morning and noon, the
Roßberg in the same direction herwärts those rocks many prongs are
the heights of Urach. There, more in the evening, is Achalm, not far
away, but you can not see him here, the rocks of Lichtenstein ""
So There, "George said quietly to himself,, and his eyes plunged
deep into the mists of the evening, "where in the clouds that
hover Abendröte, there is a faithful heart for me, now it is perhaps
at the pinnacle of the rock and looks over into the world by
mountains, perhaps after that rocks out.

Oh that Abendlüfte bring you my greetings and those rosy clouds you
like my close proclaimed! "" Continue out, but you see those sharp
corner, that is the Teck; our dukes call themselves Dukes of Teck, it
is a good, solid castle, your gaze turns to the right here, that
high, steep mountain was once the home of famous emperors, it is
Hohenstaufen. "" But how is the castle, which initially rises from the
deep? " asked the young man, "just see how the bright sun on its
white walls reflect how their battlements in golden scent seem to
dive, as their towers in reddish light shine." "That is Reuss, Sir,
also a strong Festivals the federal government to make. "The sun of
the short, beautiful day in March began during this conversation
the hiker hinabzusinken. The shadows of the evening rolled dark
veil over the mountains and concealed the eye to distant peaks and
heights. The pale moon came up and his nocturnal overlooked area. Only
the high walls and towers of Neuffen rötete the sun with its last
rays, as this was her favorite rock from which they are reluctant to
distinguish. They declined, but those walls are wrapped in darkness,
and went through the woods the night air, mysterious whispering
greetings, opposite the bright moon.

"Now is the true time of day for thieves and volatile for travelers like
us," said the farmer, he Junkers aufzäumte of the horse, "it was
still an hour, then the coal-black night, and then let us, until
the sun rises again, not a track rider bündischer!"

"Do you think there was threat?"

George said, by his hand to the helmet and the thin ausstreckte
beret fell. "Do you know we should be better prepared?"

"Let's hang, Junker," said the farmer, laughing, "such a Balaclava in
itself is cold and fresh in a night is not very warm, always let your
beret sitting in this area they are looking for the Duke is not,
and should they come, we have two of their four fear not.

"The young man reluctantly let his beautiful helmet hanging on the
saddle knob, he was ashamed to show less courage than his companion,
who, unberitten, only by a thin leather cap and protected with a
simple ax was poorly armed.

He swung on. Its leaders took the reins of the horse and went on
down the hill.

"You think so," said George after a while, "up to here are the riders
bündischen not dare?" "It is probably not possible" replied the piper,
"Neuffen is a strong castle, and has a good crew. They are there
in a short time with power besieging army, but rabble, like the
handful of riders Truchseß, yet dares not near an enemy castle."

Look how beautiful and bright the moon shines, "cried the young man
who, still filled with the sight on the mountain, the quaint shadows
of the woods and heights, the rocks looked hellglänzenden," see
how the window in the moonlight Neuffen shimmer!

"" It would be my dear, he seemed not tonight, "said his guide, he
sometimes worried umsah," dark night would be better for us, the moon
has some good man betrayed. It can not be long , he is down. "They
went further, however.

The Pfeifer Georg Hardt maintained on a series of stories about the
area, which they crossed. "Horch! You are not hearing the neighing
of horses, "said George suddenly, which is in the gorge, they
crossed, was quite scary.

The moon still shone brightly, the shadows of the oaks moved, it swept
in the bushes, and often wished he bedünken as he can see dark shapes
in the woods next to reciprocating. The Pfeifer Hardt stopped. "It
came to me earlier as well, but it was the wind, in the oak groans, and
the Schuhu cried in the bushes. Had we only the Wiesental yet over,
because it is so open and bright as day; begins again beyond the
forest, since it is dark and does not need more.

Give your brown and the spores riding trot out over the valley, I walk
beside you forth. "" Why not now go at once? "Asked the young man" Do
you know there was danger? Confess just not true, you have also
seen the figures in the woods, next to us herschlichen? Do you think
there are Bündische? "" Well, "whispered the peasant, he is
umsah," to me it was as if someone referred to us Play; drum sputet you
that we are doomed from the sunken come out, and then on Trab across the
valley, still there was no danger. "George made his sword into the
vagina loose and took the reins of his steed into the powerful
fist. Silently they moved down the canyon, illuminated by bright
moonlight, so that the young man all his train companions could identify
and clearly saw that his ax on his shoulder and took a knife, which
he had hidden in the doublet, and pulled in the belt fastened.

They wanted to just at the exit of the sunken into the valley, as called
for a vote on the bush: "This is the Pfeifer Hardt, drauf, journeymen,
there on the horse's rights must be!"

"flee, Junker, flee," cried his faithful guide and stood with his ax
ready to fight, but George pulled his sword, and in the same moment
he saw five men attacked, while his companion with three others
already in the scuffle was.

The close Hohlweg prevented him to his advantage to operate and to avoid.
One grabbed the reins of his steed, but In a moment he met George
on the forehead blade that he niedersank without sound, but the others,
enraged by the fall of their comrades, penetrated even more on him
and called him to be revealed, but George, although he has by the
arm and foot was bleeding from several wounds, replied only by sword
blows.

"alive or dead," cried one of the combatants, "when the Lord willeth
not Duke, it's like he has." He's cried, and fell in the same moment,
Georg von spring storm, from a heavy blow on the head, down. In deadly
weariness he closed his eyes, he felt himself lifted and carried
away, and heard only the grim smile of his killers who have their
triumph seemed to catch.

After a while we had him on the ground, a rider sprinkled up, sat
and joined those who had borne him. Georg raffte his last strength,
to the eyes again to open it.

He saw an unknown face, bent over him. "What have you done?" he heard
calling. "This is not, you have taken the wrong people. Power, that
your continued commitment to Neuffen of us are on the heels. "Matt
George to death included his eye, his ear just heard wild voices
and the sound of the dispute ends, but this is made, damp cold
penetrated from the bottom of the Wiesental and made his limbs
ossify, but a sweet slumber to cut down on the wounded, and with
the last thoughts of the meaning of its vanished lover.

Chapter 15 The Swabian Confederation was in power Württemberg infiltrated,
from day to day, he won on the ground, from week to week, his
armies were terrible. The first was after a long and brave
resistance of the Light Stone, the firm Castle of Heidenheim,
fallen. Teck, was still a strong fortress, fell through the carelessness
of the crew, stayed at the bravest Möckmühl; it included a man in his
walls, which are alone with twenty of the besieger would have been
beaten, his iron will was often no less seriously than his iron hand
on them also located these walls were broken, and Götz von
Berlichingen fell into federal hands.

Also Schorndorf could Georgs the cannons of Frondsberg not resist, it
was the firmest town, with it fell the Unterland. It was now entirely
up to Württemberg against Kirchheim in Bündischen violence, and the
Bavarian Duke broke with his camp in order to handle Ernst to go to
Stuttgart. As he came forward after envoys Denkendorf who begged for
mercy. You could not dare before their bitter foe Duke to apologize,
but she said to remember that yes, he is the cause of the war, no
longer among them is that you only against his innocent boy, Prince
Christoph, and against the Land war leads. But before the bronze
forehead of William of Bavaria before the greedy eyes of the Federal
members found this request no mercy. Ulrich had earned a penalty, gave
the answer, the country had supported him, thus caught, hung with -
Stuttgart also had its doors open. But still the victory was
nothing less than full, the largest part of the Highlands was still
Duke, and it seemed not as if he at first wanted to call revealed.
This higher-lying mountainous country was founded by two permanent
seats, and Tübingen Urach dominated; as long as they are held, also
wanted to roam the countryside does not fall off. In Urach held the
citizenship of the Federation, the crew with the duke. It came to a
scuffle, in which the brave commander was stabbed, the city was
the Bündischen.

And it was in the middle of April only Tübingen left, but this
was strongly attached to the duke, there were his children and the
treasures of his house; the core of the nobility, forty brave,
kampfgeübten knights and two hundred of the country's bravest
children was entrusted to the castle. This was highly resistant, with
war stores, which probably, in their eyes which were now the Württemberger,
because from these walls, they were already many Beautiful and Wonderful
emerged, from these walls could from the land returned to the rightful
princes are captured when it is so long held, until he Entsatz
herbeibrachte. And it turned Bündischen now with all his might. Armed
their steps sounded by the Schönbuch, the valleys of the Neckar Hufschlag
trembled under their steeds; in the fields showed deep scars,
while the heavy box of snakes and bombarde Falkonen the ball and
powder-wagons, the whole apparatus of a terrible long siege was
withdrawn. This progress of the war had George of spring storm not seen.
A deep, sweet sleep but felt like a powerful spell his senses caught
many days and it was him in this state probably felt like a child on
the bosom of his mother is sleeping, only occasionally the eyes a
little open, to enter into a world to look, it still does not know it
then in the long run to close. Beautiful soothing dreams of better days
gaukelten to his camp, a mild, happy smile often drew on his pale
face and comforted those who were with him banger expectation
cultivated. We dare the reader to the lower lodge to keep it hospitable
to had, on the morning of the ninth day after he was wounded.

The morning sun broke off of this tag in colored rays of the round
slices of a small window and lit the larger chamber a poor farm.

The device, which it was equipped, testified from poverty but from
a sense of cleanliness and order.

A large oak table stood in one corner of the room on two sides by
a wooden bank surrounded.

A carved, painted with bright colors Shrine liked the Sunday of the
residents or beautiful canvas selbstgesponnene contain the dark
Getäfel contributed around a board, as bare jugs, cups and plates
of tin, irdenes dishes rich with meaningful rhymes and painted all
sorts of musical instruments of a long verflossenen century, such
as cymbals, and a zither shawms, were established.

To the big stove, the far vorsprang were clean linen hung out to dry,
and they almost concealed the eye a large body bed, with curtains
of großgeblümtem tissue in the rearmost part of the office was
established.

On this bed sat a beautiful, sweet child , of about sixteen to
seventeen years.

It was in those picturesque peasant costume dress that is partly down
to our days in Swabia has received. Your yellow hair was uncovered and
fell in two long, with colorful ribbons on durchflochtenen braids
down their backs. The sun had its friendly, round face little bit
tanned, but not so much that this beautiful young red on the cheek
would have been obscured, and a lively blue eyes looked at the
long lashes out.

The lady, surprised at this freedom, drew back a few steps to examine
the speaker; she turned her black eyes upon him, full of the keen
sagacity so natural to women, seeking apparently to discover in what
interest he stepped forth to explain Mademoiselle de Verneuil's birth.
Corentin, on the other hand, who was studying the lady cautiously,
denied her in his own mind the joys of motherhood and gave her those
of love; he refused the possession of a son of twenty to a woman whose
dazzling skin, and arched eyebrows, and lashes still unblemished, were
the objects of his admiration, and whose abundant black hair, parted
on the forehead into simple bands, bought out the youthfulness of an
intelligent head. The slight lines of the brow, far from indicating
age, revealed young passions. Though the piercing eyes were somewhat
veiled, it was either from the fatigue of travelling or the too
frequent expression of excitement. How long you are in Spain? A
little more full year. And for what? Not at all. Poor man! What I
found easy, and it is not difficult if not impossible ... For
further displeasure in front of that blessed and cursed woman, I
become the most tasteless of schoolchildren. Why is this? And tell me
otherwise, you idiot, what has that monkey that you've thus
stultifying for her? Others are more beautiful, some have more
talent, others are more elegant, and yet it is number one, number
one. Going to go mad for my taste, and feel it in me noticed that
there was ever a joy, a sadness ... want to mourn, to laugh, and
even make a fool in front of her.

Nothing, that forty-eight years I get the measles and age of the
turkey. Nor have I ever had happened which I now pass, cut, I feel
like being daring and I can not. I will say a gallantry intentional,
and I get a simple. Instills a respect that I ever knew. The I to
Biarritz, the escort to Paris, and the longer the treatment, the
more I am bound by this cursed respect ...

I cut myself this respect as a short hand gangrene. Why is this
respect? What's this?

Whatever you want, that woman I would say that so far I have not said
no, and that is that if unmarried, marry me ...». she was so
agitated that he had to get up and get a ride.

"Take this world is a funny thing. Yo bitch, she unhappy because her
husband is blind and unaware of the gem it has. Two of these misfortunes
could make a happy, if not the world which is full of slavery and
slavery slavery ... I think I'm seeing when I said that ... What a
giggle, what serenity, and what answer so admirable! I was glued to the
wall. So I'm stuck, I have not returned the other, and when I prepare
something to say, Come brave! ... I say the opposite. It becomes a very
foolish thing is that I do not fit in the head. Ouch! God, if I die,
and thinking lives beyond death, I will be watching all eternity
this funny face, with its celestial expression, these serene and
laughing eyes, dark hair is white with gusts that make it so much
grace ... the mouth that does not speak without me duela el alma.

Poor angel!, His only passion is maternal thirst unsatisfied,
immense sorrow. His passion is me and burns me, I too have a son, me
too. If I feel I am watching!, If you're here at the edge of life,
looking at me, telling me that you bring, not bring more than needed.
Would if she would like. I am sure that would come, is an idea that I
was stuck here. And I say: 'For a child, could be under the ...'. Oh,
do not have the courage to say this ... But how? If there is no
word that they say !...».

The throbbing was so strong that he felt he had to sit. Drowned. In the
heart or near it, more to the center, felt the blow of blood, hard
and strong rhythm.

It was as though a blacksmith hammers heart next to it, a riveting
piece of new fire that had just been cast. "This is horrible. If
broken, break at once. Woe is me! ... If I wanted, I heal the heart,
as a disease that is not what you have, but impatience ... hormiguilla
... What have I done to be so dirty? Now down to the account that I
have not ever fun. All my adventures have been the desire to run
behind the nuisance.

And people think that I have been a happy man, I'm sick of congested
joys! Stupid! '. Without knowing how or why some impressions of that
day were reproduced in his mind. Including less fugitive was this:
In the morning, entering retirement, he was a front of these poor
foul call that often at the extremes of the population, which sometimes
run up the middle.

He was a man covered with rags, and walked with a foot and a crutch,
the other leg was a member disgusting, thigh swollen and covered
with scabs, his foot hanging dry, and bloody report. Showed that to
excite compassion. It was the way his leg for him to live, his farm,
his office, which is for beggars musicians guitar or violin. Such
spectacles outraged Moreno, that when the industry beset by human
misery, Trina anger. So when he returned to see him not, the damn, with
its nimble sidestep a crutch, you will be put forward again, showing
the leg. When you are bored gentleman took the desire to give alms,
and finally came to escape persecution as terrifying.

Alejose the beggar, reneging. "Neither this country nor is capital, there
is no civilization! ... What I want to pass the Pyrenees! ". Well,
that night, he represented the poor paralytic so vivid, it almost felt
almost see him in his bedroom. There was a moment when the hallucination
of Moreno became so effective, he joined, and taking a book that in the
next chair was ... "Look, if you march with your leg podrida ...».
Then his head fell again on the sofa and put his hand over his eyes.
"The unhappy has to seek life in some way.

He has no guilt there is no evil in this land of charity establishments.
If I see him tomorrow, I am a hard ... If you go I ... What will
be envied my aunt Wilhelmina! Volvámonos now to the wall to see if I
sleep a little. So, shut your eyes.

No, better to open, and I figure I want to wake up. What you want is
not ever. C'mon, I do figurémonos efforts not to fall asleep. And
for what I want to sleep? Better is it that way, thinking his
stuff in one. These stripes of paper, blue and green, break distance
of twenty-five centimeters, no, twenty. The flower gray alternating
with blue flower. Nice drawing. How he would head to invent it!
... And here is a small stain ... I think if I were to look at the
light, I sleep early, Back again. Miró put the light on the central
table, large, round and covered with rich carpet. The oil lamp was made
up of two bronze candilones joined by a shank. Both lights were
green screens, with addition of satin of the same color, like skirts
that fell for one of the two circles. Clarity spread the table, and
the rest of the room was in darkness spotted with greenish patina
of old carpet. On the table was a pair of gloves, several books, two
portraits in beautiful frames, one of the big Arnaiz, a paper mill,
dinnerware set of fine porcelain, a box of ivory and other objects very
beautiful. "That glove - said Moreno - which assembles on the paper,
it seems that is exactly lebrel after the game ... What is so
solemn silence now! The source of the leak Pontejos is what it feels
like forever, and that any other car that passes through the Puerta del
Sol .. Are worn, to be withdrawn. So I went on my _cab_ to leave the
club in Piccadilly ... just ran my _cab_ as an exhalation, and
these seem little and go carts that are rolled over the cobblestones.
And how cool I am ... the memories! It seems that I am looking at
others that appeared to me one night in Haymarket, leaving that bar
.. I do not have occurred otherwise ...! And how silly this looked like
Fenelon Aurora! Everything changed, everything is turning to fall behind
in the wake left by the boat ...». suddenly took a leap, and was
rising to give tours. "I am myself - he said - yes, I am going
to always. ¡I die here, so I carried on these trucks so
kitsch! No, thank God I take a decision, and this is what comes
fuertecilla. I had come suddenly and with a push ... I can not wait to
dawn to send Tom to make the luggage. Tomorrow I will do my
shopping. You can not go to Spain without a carry gifts for fans
and tambourines ...

Oh, how happy I am with this idea that has given me! ¡Irme! ... If
you should resolve this long! Why are you here for consumirte
more? Come on, do not tell them not to obey, his desires are orders.
He said: 'My friend, go,' and I'm leaving. I want when I go? Think of
me ...? Could well be ... If you are convinced that the love I have
for her husband is like a donkey to throw roses so they eat, if
you believe this ...!

But to expect that you will be convinced. No way. Crazy monkey that
wants to, and wanting to die. I figure that I despise you and loves
you: these are dualisms in the human heart. But I say: do not pass
through his mind the idea of ever love me? I am content with
this, with the idea that had happened once, going twice.

May well have said: 'How good is this Moreno! If I were his wife,
would not trouble me, and we would have had a little boy, two or
more'. Who knows ... Will said this before?

I do not know why I figure it has said. What do I know ... nest inside
this belief as a source of hope, like a seed that is within the land
and has not sprung but living ... If I know that she has said
this, I view it as the religious, I become the man of the Catholic world
... For fun, how many functions and masses had to pay me! And it would
be hypocritical, because they love it, would the faith, the faith
itself, which has been I do not know where ...

I think it is dawning. I do not sleep, so I have no more. I'm leaving
tomorrow, and I would go this afternoon, if I had time to arrange
the trip ... And another thing.

Will I go to say goodbye to her? I do not know what to determine. If
I am not going. ¿Well why not? I'll go.

She told me that I go, I want to go. By far the want the same thing as
closely, and she might want. I will be to her as a dream, and
dreams tend to hurt the heart more than the reality. "Lie down again,
and entertained with wandering eyes contemplating the walls of the room.
There was a San Jose, big picture, family, painting it as worth
little, but Moreno did in high esteem because it was many years
in the bedroom where he was born.

Was associated with the impressions of his childhood as one holy guapote,
reclined on clouds, with his stick, his child, and one yellow layer
whose folds were celaje the competition.

You will be refreshed so good knight then the memory of his father, it
seemed that I was seeing and hearing the voice of metal. His mother
had not known, because he died as a child.

He also remembered when he and his sister (the widow that same sister
who lived there), went to grandpa's house in Concepcion Jerónima,
holding hands.

And one evening, at the Imperial revolver street were lost, ie it was
lost, and he almost dies of fright. Well one day I was on the Plaza
de Province, saw the donkey in a water carrier, loose, the owner was
at the tavern next. Manolito Entráronle want to get the colt, and as
I thought it did. But the condemned animal, as he escaped out the
rider, and although the boy did efforts to stop it, could not ...
Total, which reached the streets of Segovia, near the bridge. And it
was not the donkey that was stopped, but the rider fell, breaking the
head.

I still had signal. Fortunately, the brothers García, Shoemakers, who
had his workshop in Sacramento corambres below, and saw him fall,
he knew, and to collect, took him home to his grandfather. The
harmonic is there! Remembered D. Manuel lance as if that had
happened the previous day, saw his grandfather, Mr. Antonio Moreno,
who still wore Chorreras, corbatín soled and Casaca all hours of the
day. Even in the warehouse (for wholesale drug store), was fractured.
Well then dad came and was hesitating whether to hit or not ... Worst
of all was that the donkey is not seen more hair, and the family
had to pay him a strong compensation. "If you think it was
yesterday," Moreno said, touching his forehead on the site where the
scar. When the day already clear, noise felt at home, but
understand what the point was. "It is at the foot _rata eclesiástica_.
Now we will hear at least seven Masses ... and treat yourself to the
Holy Trinity. ¡Poor, what out of that! ... But in the end, pull out
or not, is a happiness to be well ...». - iv - Wilhelmina gave two
taps on the door, and opened a little, she came by her face smiling
and her eyes alive.

"Son, to see the light in your bedroom, said that Poor is still sailing.
I see you get it right.

What is that?, Have you passed a bad night. "- I see. Pasa. I
have not slept at all. And you - Me?, I lay on the side, dawn. No
more than four hours sleep, but go a hitch.

Do not you see that I come home rendered? And I have to ruminate on
it for Pat. - What a joy!

Going to church now? - Yes, for what he likes mandar - replied the
saint, and wash off his face just as much joy freshness. - And so
...!

, quiet because you're very quiet. .. with your morning Masses, and the
rest of the day by shaking each sablazo mystery. You know what?, I envy
you ...

I would change for you ... - Well, fool (towards him), what I do
is easy, what more you have to ... do - sit a little - said Moreno,
making it on the couch and giving a pat on the seat -. More holiness
hear that seven masses, is in practice works of mercy, to accompany
the sick and giving a little talk to who has spent the whole
night sailing. Tell me one thing. How to get your works asylum? - I
do not know? (sitting). Well. Thanks to the souls, the building will
cast sparks. Jacinta has taken much heat, which now works more than
me, and handles the sword with a panache that leaves me tamañita.
- You have some friends that are worth anything. Tonight I thought of
you and in your devotions. You'll be amazed if I tell you that since
the morning I was down here a feeling unknown, wanted to do something
like religion, thinking about God, to dedicate myself to works of
mercy ... - Manolo! ... (being serious). If you start with your
bromitas, I'm going. - No, no joke - he replied, and his face had
that expression of despondency, which the saint was looking like
Lela ... - But you joke or ...?

Manolo, what you think ... What's wrong? - There are hours in life
that seem centuries by bringing mudanzas.

A while ago, you see what a thing so strange!

I remembered a poor charity asked me this morning ... He was a man
who has a deformed leg and disgusting, full of sores ...

I asked him alms and threw a copper coin, with horror, saying:
"Take off you before me, so Pillet.

Well tonight I had the visit here of that man ... I've seen, like I'm
watching you, and inspire disgust me first, then compassion, and
I finished by saying: "You want me to change?".

Podrida because his leg, his crutches and his freedom, he enjoys a
tranquility that I have not.

Your conscience is like a puddle empozado in which the stone falls
ever smaller.

Poor me! Would change with him, my wealth would change for her begging,
my sick heart inert on his leg, and my anxiety for her peace.

What do you think - I believe that God touches you in the heart -
the lady said winking eyes, and putting on the head of the unfortunate
gentleman his right hand, which was the book of Mass and the Rosary
-. You do not have your face jokes.

Some very big procession you walk inside. And sometimes if you tell
the vein by heresies and rage do not think you have given me bad.
You are a blessed, and if ever lived with us and do not spend their
lives between Protestants and atheists, you would be another. - But
I do not know who I am - Are you going?

, Really - with Live distress -. Mal business. Always looking for
cool, always running away from the heat of the family. - No, if this
is where I want - Moreno said with grim air. - Do not you want? Go
with what you leave ... Silly, do not say nonsense. - My life is
completely broken and truncated. There is no way of soldiers and
...

Cree me that if I wanted to be here, I would be good and give pleasure
to you and your friends would make me very religious, very close
friend of God and the Virgin spent all my money in works of charity,
devotion protect ...

The surprise of the saint was so great that I could not express.

I opened my mouth, amazed, as if witness a miracle. "But you really ...
Look, son, if you want me to create this state of your mind, I must
try it ...». - How I probártelo - Let's see - virgin and founder
said, with resolution --. Do not do something? - What do I do? - What
do not you come with me to San Ginés - A yes. Got up to pull the
bell.

"I need to see it to believe it - Wilhelmina said, casting his eyes
sparks of joy -.

Leaves, I will call Thomas. The poor kid will not be built yet. "- I
think so ... Tom! ... - I will make you tea ... Come on, get dressed.
Aquella morning departure pleases because breaking the tedious routines
of his existence. "If I go to church ... (available with feverish
activity). And the masses will hear all you want, and pray with you
... Tell me Jacinta will not at this time to San Ginés?. "- Man,
not so early. A little later than I usually go Barbara. -
Well, I am glad we are we the first, the early birds, the most eager
to meet and sanctify ... Tom! The English came, as recently, when
his master was already dressed, brought him tea.

Guillermina serving breakfast, she said: "Abrígate, that the mornings
are cool. Is not that something to start your new life, you'll
catch pneumonia. "- Best ... I believe that living is the largest of
the nonsense - told him, down the stairs -.

What a living? To suffer. The poor of the leg which is what happens
regularly. Because it did not hurt.

Bring your leg in front as if it was a beautiful thing that the public
wants to know. - There is much misery - observed the lady, taking
the item on the other hand - and we eat what we complain about
service.

The more suffering here, the more we enjoy there. (The misanthrope
said nothing to this. Pensativo remained so.) "The beggar of the leg
will go to Heaven derechito, with his crutch, and many of the rich
who walk around in drum , Iran muellemente so it hell to hang out.

I ask God to give me the most filthy of diseases, y. .. If I do not
want to do, always so healthy. Patience, he always gives us what
we need.

"Nor is this anything Moreno said. Entered San Ginés, Guillermina
and went right to the chapel of la Soledad, a point that was the
first mass.

While this lasted, the illustrious lady, but her attention away from the
office, was able to warn her that after her nephew was in compliance
with all the ritual as any devout, kneeling and lifting at convenient
times.

But in the second mass observole distracted and restless. Going
from one place to another, examining the altars and images as if
in a museum.

This displeased, and such was his discomfort that he did not dare to
communicate that day because he was not quite in the spirit of calm
and clean.

Already in the fourth mass, the gentleman that not only distracted
but disturbed the devotion of the faithful, passing in front of the
altar where Mass was said without the slightest bow or genuflection.

"I'll have to tell him to go - I thought the holy -. That is no
way to be in the church. Hallábase Moreno contemplating a recumbent
image enclosed luxury box of glass, at his side when he whispered
this: "Bonita effigy right?

It is Christ who took part in the procession of the Santo Entierro.
"Turned and saw his side Estupinan, to draft the ears black knitted
hat, pointing with a gesture of the image guide."

The shroud of the finest embroidered ladies netherlands Micaela,
and is a gift from Barbara.

Sculpture pride ... and motion, because he nailed to the cross
or _descendemos_ as it should. "And as the gentleman did not say
anything, was left praying Plácido between teeth.

Sat on a bench, and since then, while serving their devotions, he
removed the eye of Mr.

Moreno, unable to explain their presence in the parish.

"It was me what to do - say - D. Manolo here ...

He who has no religion! Is that like to see good pictures ... I started
out there.

"Menudo réspice he threw his nephew to the founder when they left.

"But, son, I've removed the devotion to walk through your church.
I already told you had to wear. "- Well, aunt, for the first day of the
course, you can not complain. Everything is starting.

You see I heard a misita.

What did you want? What were you like? I assure you that I
enjoyed the test. I spent a very pleasant time in a state of
tranquility that has made me much good. You complaints that I walked
by the church ...

Is that going to do when a new life, likes to learn ...

I wanted to look good images. Believe it if you continue in Madrid, I
would make friends with them all.

I like to see them as beautiful, with its luxury clothes and their
eyes fixed on one point.

It seems they are seeing something that does not come just come.

We think that we look when we say something, and actually we have
to console if we ask something.

I understand the mystique, I see clearly ... Ah, if I was here ... - Why
do not you stay ...

What a fool! - Told with the holy sorrow. - Impossible! ...

I gotta go ... And there I shall be very sad, as if he saw ... - So
... stay. Want to give you a job? Absence makes you good. Sobrestante
you mention my work, my manager and clerk largest collections of
my new chapel, when completed.

Moreno laughed with wins. 'Choirboy more ...! I agree. I swear
it would ...

I'm going entirely for children. ¡Altar boy in the head! And I spark
the candles, I remove the dust and put the pictures so beautiful,
I'd charlaría blessed with ...

Do not believe it, but inside me is something that is born combines
very well with this humble craft.

Madame du Gua
noted in that one look far more of love than of pity in Mademoiselle
de Verneuil's intervention; and she was right. The handsome creature
blushed beneath the other woman's gaze, understanding its meaning, and
dropped her eyelids; then, as if aware of some threatening accusation,
she raised her head proudly and defied all eyes. The commandant,
petrified, returned the paper, countersigned by ministers, which
enjoined all authorities to obey the orders of this mysterious lady.
Having done so, he drew his sword, laid it across his knees, broke the
blade, and flung away the pieces.

"Mademoiselle, you probably know what you are about; but a Republican
has his own ideas, and his own dignity. I cannot serve where women
command. The First Consul will receive my resignation to-morrow;
others, who are not of my stripe, may obey you. I do not understand my
orders and therefore I stop short,--all the more because I am supposed
to understand them."

the sound came from a postilion harnessing his horses to the coach,
and he cast aside his suspicions, all the more because it seemed
absurd to suppose that the Chouans would risk themselves in Alencon.
He returned to the house confounded.

Ya you know me. "Indeed, Narciso not told anyone, with one exception.
Because, really, what mattered secretillo to rely on one person,
one who had not been fixed for spreading?

"You will only tell you because I know that you are very discreet -
Narciso whispered to her ear Encinas friend _ (Quercus )_--.
gigantea Be careful what you order ... but carefully. Only you know.
Do not have an annoyance. "- Man, do not be silly ... Looks like you
know me yesterday. You know that I am a tomb. The tomb was opened in
the house of the cane, with the largest means, and after you swear
to all of the most solemn manner that would keep that deep arcane.

"But what have you, Encinas! We do not make you so little favor.

Not that we were girls, to go with the story and engage you ...».

But one of those ladies thought it was mortal sin not to doña Lupe
indicate something, because finally I had to know, and prepare
itself for such a tremendous blow.

Poor lady! It was a pain to see her with that quiet, so alien to the
disgrace which threatened her. Total, that the news reached the ear
of Doña Lupe subtle to have three days left lip shy of _Rubinius
vulgaris_.

They say that Doña Lupe was a good time as people who see visions.
After intimated that something Barruntar her, for the anomalous
behavior of her nephew. ¡Proud that one has to do with many men!
Bah!, May not be true. And if it was, was soon to learn, because, yes,
to Doña Lupe is not die in the pump body, and that same evening or the
following morning, Maximiliano and she would face .. . That Ms. Jackson
was flown widow, it tested the insecurity of their way to cover the
distance between home of the Cane and yours.

Talking alone, and he dropped the umbrella twice, and when they declined
to pick up, he dropped the handkerchief, and finally, instead of
entering the gate of his house, entered the next.

As the house was in very hipocritón, her aunt was going to make green!
But surely not because it was eleven o'clock at night, and was not
señoritingo never before twelve or one ... Who had to say, but who
would say that ...!, circuit, that scourge of boy, that futility,
fulastre and so little that he had no breath to extinguish a candle,
and at eighteen years yes, what could ensure Doña Lupe, I did not
know what they are women and children believed to have been born in
Paris, the man failed to fall in love so, and from whom!!

woman lost but lost ...!, ... in every sense of the word. 'Have you
been the gentleman? "asked his servant, and as such will not reply,
frunció lips in a gesture of impatience. The anxiety and anger have
reached what I know to where, if not a little off on the innocent
head of potato, and said the head, because this was the most
experienced at that achuchón.

Has to know that Daddy was somewhat assumed, and that being their primary
beauty and abundant black hair, he put in his five senses.

It is combed with art early, becoming sortijillas and pin curl the
fringe and do not have tongs, used a thick piece of wire, heating
it to red.

Had wanted to do this morning, but as their love stood before her, could
not be. The night when I was single, was the best time to devote
himself entirely free to the hairdresser elegant.

A piece of mirror, a toothless beater, tragacanth, and a little fatter
wire will suffice. Not on their sins, that night had been working
with hair so perfectly, that ... 'Daughter, nor to go to a dance,'
she had said to herself, with convulsive laughter, to look in the mirror
sections of face, because once I could not watch it all. "Puerca,
fantasmona, mamarracho - Doña Lupe shouted furious manot destroy all
those profiles that the kid had in his head -. In this pass
the time ... Are not you ashamed to walk with clothes full of holes,
and instead of sewing you want to atusarte by the mane? ¡Presumida,
scoundrel! And the book? Even the've looked ...

Ya, and I will give you Hairs / Pelitos. I will take you to the
barber and raparte head dejándotela as an egg. "If you had said
that he cut his head, had not felt the girl terror." That, now moquito
and lagrimita after me blood poisoning with your hair indecent. You
look like the Mona Retiro ... You are beautiful ... yes ...

But what, you have also missed ointment?. "Doña Lupe will smell the hand
with which he had worn the wrong criminal flequillo. By bringing his
hand to his nose, made with such a majestic gesture, which is a
shame not played a good teacher of sculpture.

"Gorrina ... I've pringá the hand ... ¡Uy, what pestilence! ... Where
did you get this crap? ". - I gave the _sito_ Maxi - Chips replied with
humility ... This led sharply Doña Lupe's ideas to the real cause
of their anger. Thought to recognize in the fourth of his nephew,
which he thanked a lot Daddy, since this was so immediate suffocation
was happening. "Go into the kitchen" said the lady, and need not,
because they sneak mice that feels like a noise. Doña Lupe light
lit on the fourth of Maximilian, and he began to observe. "If you
find a letter! - Thought -. But quia! Now I remember that I have said
that Tarasca not write. It is an animal in every sense of the word.
'Register here, register there, nothing was to serve as a check to
the horrible news. Opened the comfortable, using the keys of his own,
and there was nothing either. The pot was in place and full, maybe
heavier than before. Portraits, not seen anywhere. Doña Lupe Hallábase
embayed police in their investigation, find no trace of the crime,
when Maximilian. Papito opened the door to his room dirigiose surprised
to see light in it, and to deal with his aunt, who was stirring
the third drawer comfortable, she realized that her secret was discovered,
and it ran chills of death throughout the body. Doña Lupe knew
contained.

He was wise and very opportunistic, I have not liked to do any thing
out of time, to warm the ears and his nephew was not a moment too
soon midnight.

Because surely she had to speak out and not be a scandal.

It was also likely that the boy give him a headache if you are very
strong so stifled mistime and Doña Lupe did not martyred.

Lelo and the student was mute on the door of his room, when her aunt
turned to him and Joanna a look of great significance, he said:
'Come, I'm going. Quiet sleep, and tomorrow you shall regulate the
accounts ...».

He went to his bedroom, but had not ten steps, became angry when
threatened with a hand and shout: 'big crook!

... But tente mouth. Keep this for tomorrow ... A bed had been
said. "Maximiliano not sleep thinking about the scene you would have
with his aunt. His imagination sometimes enlarge the conflict to do
so beautifully terrible as a scene from Shakespeare, others reduced
to manageable proportions so often. 'And what, lady aunt, and what -
said lifting the shoulders into the bed, as if he were standing
-. I met a woman I like and I want to marry her. I do not see
why we are so cool ... Well ... Am I a machine? ... Do you not have
my free will ... What have you figured me? ". At times it felt
so strong in his right, which wanted him to get up, run to the
bedroom of his aunt, throw in a foot, and drop the wake jicarazo: "Know
that you are touching me dance. If my family strives to
treat me as a kid, I would try my family that I am man. " But
suppose the ice cream was the answer to his aunt, who surely would
be this: "What you had to be a man, who had to be ...?».

When the good guy got up the next day was Sunday, Doña Lupe and had
returned from church.

Entrole Chocolate Chips, and the truth, could not pass it because
he had been placed on the epigastrium tension distressing infallible
symptom of tight situations, both because of exams for another fear
or shock anyone.

Lívido was, and the lady must have felt pity when he saw him come
into his cabinet, as the criminal who enters the courtroom.

The window was open, and Doña Lupe close to the Poor is not constipated,
because one thing is the health and justice. Was the offender with his
hands in his pockets and a Scottish hat on head, new boots and clothes
inside the house, so dull and depressed that needed bronze to be
no compassion.

Doña Lupe had a skirt with lots of newspaper and placed admirably
large patches, blue apron tables, dark toquilla bust involving the
arrogant, black bandana on his head, and red mittens borceguíes
felt thick and soft, so soft that their steps were as those of a cat.

The gabinetito was a very clean piece. A comfortable and closet
were vulgar moon form the main furniture. The sofa and chairs were
lined _crochet_ a style guest house, all done by the lady of the
house.

But what was a great aspect to the cabinet was the portrait of the
late husband of Doña Lupe, hung in the presidential site, a cuadrángano
oil, perverse, representing D.

Pedro Manuel de Jáuregui, alias _The of Pavos_, dressed in the
militia commander, with his morrión in one hand and another in the
baton. Painting more vulgar imagine it was not possible. The author
must have a specialty in samples from cows and houses of donkey milk.
It maintained, however, that Doña Lupe Jáuregui was the portrait of
a masterpiece as soon as they had dealt out two notable things in
that painting , namely that wherever they put the viewer's eyes
gazed at the portrait that you look at the chain and watch, the
Gola, buttons, and the carrillera plate morrión, in a word, all the
metal was painted in the most extraordinary and masterful.

The photographs were guards of honor to the canvas were great, but
hanging with so little sense of symmetry, they are animated beings
that he thought his discretion by the wall. "All right Mr. D. Maximiliano,
very well - said Doña Lupe severísimamente watching his nephew -.
Sit there for a while. "- III - Doña Lupe Turkeys of the - i -
Maximiliano not sat Doña Lupe themselves on the center of the sofa
below the portrait, to give more austerity trial.

Said the "very good, Mr. D. Maximilian "with retintín sarcastic. In
general, where his aunt gave him treatment, called _señor don_,
the poor kid saw the cloud of hail on her head.

'Stand killing a lifetime - she continued - to push the dichoso niece,
circumvent the power of mime disease and care, give me a career
by taking the bread from the mouth, he do not all mothers do for
their children to at last!

... Good pay, excellent ... No, I did not explain anything, if I am
perfectly informed. I know who that is ... illustrious lady with whom
you want to marry.

Come on, good girl that you sing ... And we believe that consenting
to such dishonor on the family? Tell me that everything was a kid and
not talking over the matter.

"Maximilian could not say so, but could not say otherwise, because
if at the back of his mind began to wake up waves of fortitude,
and these waves busted before descomponían reaching the shore, or
to the lips.

I was so cut, that feeling within itself the energy could not show
on that naughty nervous excitement attached to it.

He left to spread their gaze over the wall ends, and there looking
for support.

In certain situations in major distress and shock of the soul, the eyes
often fixed on something insignificant and that has nothing to
do with the situation.

Maximiliano contemplated for a while the group photo of the girls
of Samaniego, Aurora, and Olympia, with white blanket, linked arms, a
very grim, the other sentimental.

Why watching that?

Their embarrassment led him to hanging up glances here and there,
caught the spirit in any object, even if the heads of the nails
holding the portraits. "Explícate, man - said doña Lupe, who was living
genius -. Is a Baby-sitting? ". - No, lady - said the accused, and
this denial was that statement, he started to encourage you to ease the
anguish that some of the mouth of the stomach. - Are you sure you
kid is not?

¡Valiente idea have you of the world and women, innocent!

...

I can not consent to such a pindonga you fooled and you take your
name for timarte honest, other Timan clock.

You must always treat the children who are half atrasaditos develop.
Remember that five years ago I was still morning abrocharte the
breeches, and was afraid to sleep alone in your room.

Unfavorable idea of his personality so exasperated the young. Growing
feeling within the bravery, but was missing words. Where the hell
were those condemned words not happened in such a trance? The accursed
habit of shyness was the cause of that stupid silence. Because the
look of doña Lupe unique fascination exercised over him, and having
much to say, unable to speak.

"But what I would say ... How do I start? "Thought setting eyes
on the portrait of Torquemada and his wife of bracete. - Everything
is fine - Doña Lupe said in conciliatory tone - if it take away from
the head such humaredas. Because you are honest feelings, you have
wisdom ... But sit down. It gives me a look of fatigue on their feet.
- It is imperative that you know well - Maximiliano said sitting
on the couch, thinking to have found a good place to start speech -
were well aware of things ... I ... you thought about ... - And
why you did not? What may be it! ... Oops, that delicadito a guy like
you get with these viciosonas ...! And no doubt you ... Thus, prompt
delivery the skin. If you fall ill, do not you come to care for your
aunt, for that which I worship it, huh? So that it serves,
ungrateful, tunante ... And you think well that when I look at you,
when you bag on with so much work for you and am more than a mother
you think that me or this payment, infamous, and I will marry a
woman of bad life ?

Rubín was green and it came out an intense bitterness of the heart to
the lips. "That is not, aunt, is not it - he said, entering into
possession of himself -.

It is a woman of bad life.

They have deceived you. "- The fact that you deceived me with your
shrink and your shyness ... But now we'll see. Do not think you're going
to play me, do not think I will leave to your liking.

By whom I tomas, bobalicón ... Ah, if I had not had so much confidence
...! But if I've been a fool if I thought you were not able to look
at a woman! You've given me good, good. You are a point ... in every
sense of the word. Maximiliano, on hearing this, was deeply embebecido,
looking at the portrait of Rufinita Torquemada. Saw it and saw it
not, and only vague and confusing nightmare, it was by the attitude of
that lady, portrayed on a seabed that was included in a boat. Itself
again, thought of defense, but could not find the weapons, ie words.

However, even for a moment he will come back down. Nervous waver your
machine, but will remain strong. "You have misinformed - awkwardly
hinted - about the person ... that ...

Neither angry nor is there such a life that is the way ... I
thought to tell you: 'Auntie, I ... I want this person, y. .. my
conscience ...'». - Shut up, shut up and not getting my anger,
to hear you say that you want to tiota a heavy rain, I want to
ahogarte, more stupid than bad ... and to hear you speak of conscience
in this treatise, I want to ... God forgive me ...

You know what I mean - said raising his voice - you know what I mean?
Since this time back to when you were treated as twelve years. Today
I am not home sales. C'mon, I'm already on my duties with
discipline ... And since I am again taking the cod liver oil. Go to
your room and quítate boots. Today I step on the road. God knows
what was going to answer the charges.

Was released into the air the first word that came visiting. It was Mr.
de Torquemada, trustworthy person in the house, which went right to
enter the cabinet, the kitchen, the dining room or wherever the
Lord was.

The physiognomy of the man was difficult to understand. Doña Lupe only
by virtue of long practice, he found some hieroglyphics on that
face ordinary and skinny, he had some military-type features with
clerical likely.

Torquemada was in his Alabardero mocedad and mustache and keeping the
knob, which were already entrecanos, I do not know what was in church,
because without a doubt affected the meekness and sweet, and some
up and down of his eyelids that adulterated innate coarseness.

The head is always tilted to the right side. His stature was
tall, but not arrogant, his head bald, stark and flaky, with a
lattice of bad hair out to cover it. As the day Sunday, carrying
almost clean the neck of the shirt, but the layer was number two,
with the turns oily and frayed edging. Pants reduced by the growth
of the knee, while he seemed to have climbed on horseback without
trabillas. His boots, being Sunday, were embetunadas that day and was
so shrill that they heard from a league.

"And how is the family?"

Asked to take a seat, after giving her hand to doña Lupe always sweating
and nephew. - Perfectly well - said the lady anxiously watching
the countenance of Torquemada -.

And at home - No news, thank God. Doña Lupe expected that day reported
a case which interested him greatly.

As ever was in the worst misfortune for not cogieran unprepared, he
thought, to see come to his agent that he was bringing bad new.
Afraid to ask. The military side of adulterated no more than expressing
an interest decided by the family. Torquemada at the end, not fond
of wasting time, she told her friend: "Come, Mrs. Lupe, today we are
good. Do not you hit me ups that bring you? ". The appearance
of the lady was lightened because he knew that his friend called
the whole collection unexpected adventures.

Echos him laugh, and put the hand inside his pocket americana. "Alas! I
can not tell you, D.

Francisco - Doña Lupe exclaimed with disbelief, crossing hands -.
Have you paid ...?».

- What you will see ... I ... nor expected.

As I went last night to tell him that on Monday embargaría. This
morning when I was dressing to go to Mass, I see him enter.

I thought that came to ask me more extensions.

As always we are being misled, today, tomorrow ... I do not believe
him or the Bible. It is very fabulous. But anyway, these stones
give us every day.

"Lord Torquemada - I said very seriously - come to pay you ...». I was
amazed what they call. Since I did not expect the ups.

Finally, he gave me the _guano_, or eight thousand reais, took his
note, and to live. - What I told you - Doña Lupe observed almost
unable to speak, with joy in his throat cut -.

Such Joaquinito Fish is a decent person.

He spends his apurillos as all those children who are good family
life, and one day have no other.

Fixed to be a player ...

Torquemada made separation of notes, giving the most to doña Lupe.

"Six thousand real you ... two thousand mine. Chiripón this has been
good. I counted, as they say, lost, because the Joaquinito that is, as
I heard, the neck with water.

Who will be the bastard who gave sablazo?

A well that does not matter to us. "- Because he did not have to provide
more ... - Look, Dona Lupe - Torquemada said, making a perfect _o_
with the thumb and forefinger and teaching your interlocutor. - ii
- Doña Lupe _o_ contemplated with reverence and heard: "Look you,
these ladies loose parishioners are good because they do not repair
the materialism of the award and the deadline, but the order is
given, and are fat .

You must be very eye with them. At the beginning, though afraid, but
as to lose the point after, as they _fu_ that _fa_. Even if you put
them in publicizing the _Gaceta_, so they stay fresh. See you at the
Casa-Marquesita Bojío; seize him last month, he sold the film
until they had the pedigree. Well, finally, the three days I saw
him in a Phaeton, as if such a thing, and went through with me and
wheeled me punctuated the mud of the street ... Not that I care about
the materialism of the mud, I say that is what they are ... ¿So
you think you found him then provide? This was the four month, but
even the five would be, as they say on everything. Truth not bother,
and if a hand is coming, when they extend, for having to give it
a happy one for a nephew destinillo, as did the boy fish with me
... materialism, but no matter the destination, perhaps the finest
cinnamon stick and, believe me you.

Therefore, you can now come knocking at the door, which I planted
chives mandar.

"Upon arrival here he took out his tallowy Petaca Torquemada. He
had so much confidence, was to throw a cigarette, offered to
Maximilian, and Doña Lupe saying he brusquely replied with disdain:
"This does not smoke."

The smoke from the pre lasted quite a while, because it varied
Torquemada the paper cigarette. After the match started scraping
the thigh. "As insurance - continued - although a lot to do, the
_chico_ the store made clothing, José María Vallejo.

There I had all the early months as a prisoner of dog ... Mil hard I
have there, and do not charge more than twenty-six each month. What is
behind? "Son, I have a great commitment and I can not wait." Lame
half a dozen layers, and I brought them, and so fresh ... And I do not
do it by layers of materialism, but to look well run. If there is no
choice, ma'am.

We must treat them well because they are not considered. It was
shown that one has the money for them to have fun. Do you remember
those students who gave us so much war?, Was the first money
that you put. ¡Aquel Cienfuegos, that Arias Ortiz! Go a few combs. If
not for me, they will not be charged ... And tunantes were so, then
going home crying regards to the extension, I was in the coffee fueled
bisteques ... and glasses of rum and come marrasquino ... Just
as one shopkeeper in the main street, he had blonde fur, are you
agree? One day, finally, brought me his watch, earrings for his wife
and twelve boxes of skins and sleeves, and that same evening, that
very afternoon, ma'am, I see me in the Puerta del Sol, perched on a car
to go the Bulls ... If you are well ... want the money, as they say,
for the pull of materialism. I am all the holy days watching Jose Maria
Vallejo, which is a good man, not despise anyone. I go to the store
and see if people, if there is movement, the yaw an echo box, I know
if the kid is going to bring the accounts receivable _guano_;
preaching to the principal, I advice, I recommend that you pay no
crucified him. If the truth is, if there is no way ... Finally, it
is soon as butter snack. And thank you, no ma'am, do not thank
that I take interest in them.

When they see me enter, if you saw what you put me face! Repair
that are not working with my money. And finally, what were they?
Pelagatos poor. They feel that because I get hard twenty-six a month,
have already met ...
Though to
them it may have been a mere circumstance of their fortuitous meeting,
yet the sky, the landscape, the season of the year, did communicate to
their emotions a tinge of melancholy gravity which gave them an
element of passion. They praised the weather and talked of its beauty;
then of their strange encounter, of the coming rupture of an
intercourse so delightful; of the ease with which, in travelling,
friendships, lost as soon as made, are formed. After this last remark,
the young man profited by what seemed to be a tacit permission to make
a few tender confidences, and to risk an avowal of love like a man who
was not unaccustomed to such situations.

"Have you noticed, mademoiselle," he said, "how little the feelings of
the heart follow the old conventional rules in the days of terror in
which we live? Everything about us bears the stamp of suddenness. We
love in a day, or we hate on the strength of a single glance. We are
bound to each other for life in a moment, or we part with the celerity
of death itself. All things are hurried, like the convulsions of the
nation. - This is a escopetazo - one said. - Come on - said another -
all are well understood: if she claimed it was not thinking about
marriage, it was vanistorio because they disdained the villagers, but
only came here a currutaco the court fell on him and grabbed him
as the spider catches the fly. pretenders neglected, which carried
all before it with resignation, assuming that the console, the
proportion of their born Doña Luz love of God and heaven, when they
learned that Mrs.

Luz liked both the ground and another man like them, not spared either,
and criticism of its lightness. - has been thrown into the arms
of the first come - exclaim -- without love, without estimation,
because neither love nor estimation born so suddenly. Has attracted
the concern of going to shine in Madrid. Buñolera gypsy To put it to
fry and sell their donuts at the corner of the house of Don Acisclo,
gypsy very judgmental, called Watermark, more famous for its judgments
Peter Lombard himself, said in ironic - Dona Luz is an oriental
pearl, the pearl does not repair the fisherman, or whether it is
true or not, it is to the fish and causes them to look at Olen's
Oclaye.

Quite a few of these murmurings reached the ears of Doña Luz, but did
not make a dent in his heart.

Nothing that shut itself found its echo in clean and quiet conscience.
Doña Luz was a woman and had soul and felt need of love.

Your love, without visible object and human, as had been dormant until
then.

An object worthy to be offered in their eyes, and Doña Luz dedicated
to everything you love.

Every day, every hour that passed, said more doña Luz on the
belief that Don Jaime deserved it.

The same love of D. Jaime, the determination with which he had
offered his hand to her, helpless, orphan and poor, the security
was better and safer. As she was getting married, seeking to be
included in Madrid, Doña Luz laughed at negligible hear. Doña Luz had
resolved not to go to Madrid while could not go: Villafría stay
living at home, here having its center, his headquarters, nest, then
take care of their property and improving and increasing irlos;
drown in your soul any propensity jealous, and not consent, but
encourage her husband to be alone in the capital, to shine in the
Congress of Deputies, in the political struggles and military
business.

Doña Luz imitated in this wanted to Vitoria Colonna, and wait for
their hero, their sun, their lover, when coming to rest at the
rustic asylum, that the love she had to fill spell and delight.

I did not want, in short, be burdensome for the office in Madrid but
rest, refuge, consolation, sweet saint, in that village.

In his talks with amorous D. James, Doña Luz unwinding its entire plan.
I wanted him to glory, power, influence at court, and this streaky
of a series of idylls in Villafría, where she had to wait as Armida
charity, every time he came to rest in his arms, covered with fresh
laurels.

Don Jaime struggling because Doña Luz had to go to Madrid with him,
but as repugnant doña Luz size obstinacy, D.

Jaime had to compromise, agreeing that for now, that is, until they
were both much richer Doña Luz continue to reside in Villafría.

All this was so poetic that fixed readers, because it knows not to
blame Doña Luz and the objectionable people in their place, but
in any case, on the contrary: over rare and magnificent, because
he preferred to live many months of the year separated from her husband
to be in Madrid because prosaic difficulties of life and economic
enough to kill the love stronger. Doña Luz, layout and thus firmly into
their own hands the future of his life, he saw no reason in his soul,
but of satisfaction and contentment. Your intimate bloomed. The sweet
dream of being a wife and mother moved with the presentation of
ineffable tenderness.

An interior lit up his mind clearly, beatified, and it seemed
that trasminando to the outside, his face radiated into and provide
your body more beautiful than ever Belda.

And the fields are filled freshness of spring to arrive and the
sky is stained with purple and gold when the sun is out, and
then showed Mrs. Luz Gallardo and more refulgente.

His joy was so noble, so generous and so confident, and divine
expression that gave joy to him was kind of nice so that the
censorship was unarmed, after all, and look, had to bless all
mankind.

In his mind it was almost all bright and cheerful. Only, back in the
depths, a small corner, where no light penetrates, and where, somewhat
confusing, as there was a germ, like a seed of faint disgust and
unease. Doña Luz unwittingly well aware of it, by instinct savior,
trying to start one seed, to drown one germ, so that it no outbreaks
of the poisonous weed.
Sometimes I feel within me that longing towards devotion which makes
my sex so nobly beautiful; and then I feel a desire, which consumes
me, for dominion and power. Perhaps it is the natural struggle of the
good and the evil principle in which all creatures live here below.
Angel or devil! you have expressed it. Ah! to-day is not the first
time that I have recognized my double nature. I want to love Mary
vermiethen, Will help your child to weigh quite busy, as she leads
me into their Kämmerlein a sing Because the love Engelein fine, since
we all sing the Gloria, the Gloria, Lady Mary!
he said.

"--that we are all struggling, more or less," she answered, "against a
thwarted destiny."

"Mademoiselle, why should we part to-night?"

"Ah!" she replied, smiling at the passionate look which he gave her,
"let us get into the carriage; the open air does not agree with us."

Marie turned abruptly; the young man followed her, and pressed her arm
with little respect, but in a manner that expressed his imperious
admiration. She hastened her steps. Seeing that she wished to escape
an importune declaration, he became the more ardent; being determined
to win a first favor from this woman, he risked all and said, looking
at her meaningly:--

"Shall I tell you a secret?"

"Yes, quickly, if it concerns you."

"I am not in the service of the Republic. Where are you going? I shall
follow you."

At the words Marie trembled violently. Juan Samaniego and depart
from the circle and chat with Jacinta and Barbara, trying to take
away the fear. There would be shot or jarana ... provisions would not
be needed ...

Oh Barbarita and dreamed to make provisions.

The next morning, if there were no barricades, Estupinan and she
would deal with that.

Gradually were parading. It was twelve. Aparisi and House-Munoz
went Bolsín including news, do not leave without first giving a
new sample of their rivalry.

The councilman was so excited motion, the contraction of its snout was
accentuated, as if that imaginary smell out of the foetid aza.

Smooth, to be governor, he wanted to take the dolphin, but this, who
had caught his wife's arm, refused to leave ...

"My wife will not let me." - My namesake - Villalonga said - is becoming
very unconstitutional.

Finally be left alone in the house.

Don Baldomero Barbarita and kissed their children and went to bed.

This did Jacinta and her husband. VIII-the-scenes of intimate life - i
- A little bedtime Jacinta noticed that her husband was sleeping
deeply. Observábale disclosed, tending a bed to look tough bed. He
thought it was talking in a dream ... but it was not just moan joint
that used to throw when he slept, perhaps because of poor posture.

Thoughts born of political conversations that night, soon fled from the
minds of Jacinta. What mattered was that she had a republic or monarchy,
or that D. Amadeo away or stay? The most important that disrespectful
behavior that was sleeping beside him as quiet.

Because he had no doubt that he was somewhat distracted Juan, not
what their parents were out for the simple reason that there never
saw him as close as his wife.

Perf kept up appearances as well, that nothing was said or not to
disclose _en familia_ conduct regular and correctísima. Treated his
wife with a love that, that ... Come on, take it for love. Only
there, inside of that door, it was discovered the frets; alone, based
on negative data, it could destroy the aura that the public and the
family were the glorious Delfín. Told her mother she was the model
husband. ¡Valiente crook! And the wife could not respond to her
mother in law when he came with those stories ... Which side would say:
'There is no such a model, no ma'am, no such model, and when I
say, well I know I will. "With this in mind, Jacinta became part of
that night, tying ropes, as she I said, to see if the facts could
make any statement in isolation. These facts are worth the truth,
do not throw much light on what we say we wanted to prove.
Such days and hours that John had left abruptly, after a while
being very thoughtful, very thoughtful.

Such days and hours that John had received a letter that he had put in
a bad mood. Even if she did, he had not been able to find. Such as
hours and days go by it and Barbarita Preciados street, they found
that John was very fast and abstracted. To see them, quedose cut
something, but I knew soon mastered.

None of these data to prove anything, but there was no doubt her
husband was hitting it. Occasionally these brooding ceased, because
John knew so arranged that his wife did not come loaded with reason
to be unhappy.

Like a wound that is fresh balsam, the penalty is Jacinta calming.

But the days and nights, without knowing how, traíanla slowly again
to the same painful situation.

And he was very particular, was so quiet, without thinking of such a
thing, and any incident, a word without reference or trivial interest,
he attacked the idea as a dart thrown by an unknown hand from afar
and come to clavársele in the brain .

Jacinta was an observer, wise and shrewd. The most insignificant
gestures of her husband, the inflections of his voice, all observed
with dissimulation, smiling when he was more attentive,
hiding with his flattery thousand surveillance, such as naturalists
and hide behind the lens with which examines the work of bees. Known
to leading questions, trap covered with foliage. But it was good to
get another catch! And for all the ingenious culprit was pretty
words: "The honeymoon is a perpetual contradiction, is ... even
ridiculous.

Enthusiasm is a state of normal infant improper. The husband thinks
about their business, women in the things of his house, and both are
treated more like friends than as lovers.

Even the pigeons, my daughter, until the pigeons when they pass a
certain age, they love this ... a sensible way. " Jacinta I laughed,
but did not allow such compromises.

The most amusing was that he was the missing man busy. Rogue
¡Valiente!

If you had absolutely nothing to do but walk and have fun ...!

His father had worked all their lives as a black to ensure the laziness
of the blessed prince of the house ... Anyway, whatever it was, Jacinta
proposed not ever abandon its attitude of humility and discretion.

Not believed that John would never scandals, and in the absence
of scandal, things would be going well. There is no existence without
the bug, a parasite inside the roe and their living expenses, and
she had two: the apartments of her husband and the sorrow not to
be a mother. Take both patience as not to jump something stronger.
Out of respect for herself, had never mentioned this to anyone,
not at the same dolphin. But this night was so communicative, so slapstick
as pillín that Jacinta was filled to the mouth of sincerity, and
word after word, gave out everything I thought. "You're kidding me,
and it is now, is long overdue. If you believe that I am stupid ...
The fool is you. "The first response of Santa Cruz was a laugh break.
Tapaba his wife's mouth to avoid clutter. After the very reason tunante
began his explanations, magazines seductive ways. But what seemed
to him empty Jacinta, in the dialectic of the heart was more a
teacher to know that he really loved!

And she touched him laugh so lightweight and crumble after arguments
... The dream, a sweet dream and they took each other, and fell asleep
happy ...

And see what are the things John was amended, or at least appeared
to be amended.

He was very high in Santa Cruz the tricks of the artist's life, he knows
things have the best possible way to standardize and refine these.
Sacaba match all the joys and distributed with these mysterious tides
of human appetite, which, when accentuated, mean a vicious
organization.

In the background there is also human nature, as in the social
area, a succession of fads, in periods of hardship that is changing
appetites. John had seasons. During regular and fixed are almost tired
of their raids, and then his wife, Mona, and so loving, excited as
if it was the wife of another. This is very old and familiar becomes
new. A text of pure disdain known to be interested again when the memory
begins to lose and stimulates curiosity. Tiernísimo this helped Jacinta
love that you had, because there it was not farcical, nor
vile interest or study.

It was, therefore, for the Dolphin and almost true that a new return to
its home port after a thousand storms. Seemed to be restored with a
love so pure, so honest and so his, because nobody in the world could
dispute. In honor of the truth has been said that Santa Cruz loved
his wife.

Even in the days more alive was the flood of infidelity, having left
for Jacinta preferably a hollow at the heart that had so many
corners and alleys.

Neither variety of hobbies and whims exclude an unshakable feeling
towards her by law and religion.

Knowing perfectly well assert his moral virtues admired it that he
did not have and that in its view, it did not lack much.

For this reason did not the humility to confess unworthy of such a
gem, as their self-esteem was always ahead of everything, and it
was worth or how many assets would have enjoyed in this world.

Vicioso and discreet sybarite and man of talent, scholarship to pursue
all the joys and quite tasteful to spiritualize the material things,
could not settle for like bought or conquered the beauty, grace,
the grace, extravagance; wanted also like virtue, not just expired,
leaving so, but pure, which in its purity it was for him its spicy.
- ii - It will be understood that the dolphin was a man entirely
unoccupied.

When he married, made the proposals to don Baldomero take thousands
and negotiate with them, and playing the stock market, and in any
other speculation.

Accepted the couple, but not satisfied with the test, and resigned at
all to get into businesses that bring many uncertainties and revealing.
D.

Baldomero was unable to escape the Spanish concern so that parents
work for the children to rest and enjoy.

Recreábase good Lord that the idleness of his son as an artisan is
recreated in his work, and admires the more pain and fatigue you are
the hands that made it.

It should also say that the young man that was not wasteful.

Spent, yes, but with a pulse and measure, and its pleasures of being
stopped when they began to demand something dissipation. In such cases,
was when her face showed him under mild and seductive. I had some
respect ingénito the pocket, and if I could buy one thing with
two pesetas, was not sure who gave him three. At all times, the flow
from a strong will always cost some work, unlike that of givers when
they think that they could breathe. And he knew so well the value
of the currency, known use in the acquisition of its pleasures
in a prudent manner and almost commercial. _sacar Nobody knew him as
a ticket to the jugo_ hard five or twenty. Of the amount that provides
any manirroto pleasure, Juanito Santa Cruz always got two. A
skillful outside financial, through generous when he knew the case so
require. Madnesses ever made, and if ever their appetites led him to
certain outstanding grasp knew in time to avoid a slip. One of the
purest joys of Mr. Santa Cruz was to know for certain that her son
was not cheating, because most of the children of families in
these depraved times. Some would have liked to D. Baldomero
Delfín that would make its superb talent in politics. Oh, if
he is released, surely descollaría. But it Barbarita discouraged.
'Politics, politics! ¿Not seeing what it is? A comedy. Everything
becomes gossip and do nothing useful ...». What was something to
ruminate D. Baldomero II was that his son did not have the
strength of ideas he had, because he thought the 73 had thought
the same thing as 45, ie there must be a long stick and a lot of freedom,
that freedom does very good friends with the religion and must be
pursued and escarmentar all going to make political shenanigans.
Because John was the same inconsistency. At the time of Prim, manifestose
enthusiastically endorsed by the duke of Montpensier. "This is the
man who should desengañaos, a man who leads backwards accounts
from your home, a model parent." D. Wine Amadeo, and the Dolphin was so
Republican that was scary to hear.

"The monarchy is impossible, you need to be convinced of this. They say
the country is not prepared for the Republic as it prepared. It is
as if it is to know a man decided to swim without entering the water.
There is no choice but to take some bad shot ...

Misfortune teaches ... and if not, see that France, that prosperity,
that intelligence, that patriotism ... Thus to pay five billion ...».
Well, sir, came the February 11 and at first it seemed that
everything was going to John what you want to mouth. "It is admirable.
The Europe is stunned. Say what you want, the Spanish people have
a great sense. " But those two months, the pessimistic ideas had
already won their hearts completely. "This is a pillería, this is a
shame. Every country has the government it deserves, and can not
govern here rather than a man who is always with a cudgel in his hand.
" By slow gradations, Juanito came to defend the idea alfonsina heat.
"By God, son - D. Baldomero said with innocence - if that can not
be 'and took a shine to the _jamases_ Barbarita Prim He banished by the
prince, and the feeling is as much part in the fate of people, all
women supported the prince and he defended with arguments drawn from
the heart. Jacinta left far behind the most enthusiastic about Alfonso.
"He is a child !»...

And there was more so. He had himself the heir of Santa Cruz for a
great person. I was happy, as if it had created and saw that it
was good.

"Because I - said its efforts to combine the truth with modesty --
I am not what peorcito of humanity.

I recognize that there are superior beings to me, for example, my
wife, but there are so many smaller, many!

". Her physical attractiveness were really great, and he himself stated
in his intimate soliloquies: "How cute I am! Well my wife says there
is no other more salty. The Poor, I want to rave ... and me to her
the same, as is just. I have a great figure, well seen and treated in
manners and I think ... we are something. " At home there was his
opinion that it was the oracle of the family and they all captivated
not only by how much he wanted and mimaban but by the spell of his
imagination, for that blessed you and your labia way insinuate.

Jacinta was the most subdued, who had not dared to argue in front
of the white family who is white, if your dear husband argued that
it is black.

Amábale with passion, not taking part in this little feeling good look
of him and his trumpery intellectuals. Regarding the moral
perfection that the family said in John, Jacinta had her doubts.

If you had. But being alone in that realm of uncertainty, sadness and
llenábase said: "Would I be complaining about vice? Will I be myself,
as they say, the happiest of women, and there will not be dropped on
it? ". With these considerations and hitting mortified to allay
their concerns as penitents beleaguered meat to be reduced to the
obedience of the spirit. Thus was not satisfied with not having
kids, "because everything can be leading - he said - except that. If I
had a child, entretendría me a lot with him and not think of certain
things." From time to ruminate on this, his mind suffered
hallucinations and delusions. Some nights, in the first period of
sleep, I felt a touch on her breast and a hot mouth sucking that.
The shock aroused the tongue, and with the sad impression that
everything was a lie, threw a alas, her husband and told him from the
other bed, "What is it, nenita ... ¿Nightmare ?».--« Yes, son, a very
bad dream. " But I did not want to tell the truth for fear that it
will take John to laugh. Corridors great dismal house it seemed, not
only because they sounded in the din of pataditas children. Rooms
unusable for the chiquillería, _cuando the hubiera_, infundíanle such
sadness that the days when he was very touched by the mania did not
pass by them. When viewed at night from the street to enter D.
Baldomero, very kind and jovial, with his face Easter finest dress
and black cloth so clean and smiling, could not help but to think
that that Mr grandchildren should have to logic in the world, and
said to himself "What is being lost abuelito!." One night at the Royal
Theater was very grudgingly. He had been all day and night at
the home of Candelaria who had a sick little girl. Grumpy and sleepy,
he wanted the opera ends soon, but unfortunately the work of
Wagner, was very long, excellent music as John and all people of taste,
but she did not fucking funny. Did not understand it, come on. For her
there was more to Italian music, while more and more organ clarita
better. He placed his specimen in the first row, and placed last in
the chair back. The three guys, Barbarita II, Elizabeth and Andrea
were very gozosas, feeling of paradise mozalbetes by arrows and boxes
for seats. Also had some seats anteojazo good. Doña Bárbara not.
When you reach the fourth act, Jacinta felt bored. Looked much the stage
for her husband and saw him not. Q.: Where was I? With this in
mind, made a courtesy to respect the great Wagner, gently tilting the
head on his chest funny. The last thing he heard was a descriptive piece
that the orchestra was like a rumor of trompetillas mosquitoes fun
with that man in the summer nights.

In this lullaby music, the lady fell into deep sleep, one of those
short and intense dreams in which the brain is pretending reality
as a relief and an admirable histrionics. The impression they leave
lethargy often more serious than we have many external phenomena and
appreciated by the senses. Hallábase Jacinta in a place that was his
home and was not home ... Everything was lined in white satin with a
flower on the previous day had seen her home and Barbarita Nephew
... _puff_ Sat on a knee and it went up a beautiful boy, who first
took him the face, then put his hand on his chest. "Remove, remove
... that is crap ... What a sick ... ugly thing, is for the cat ...».
But the boy was not a party. I had no more than the shirt of fine
holland, and slip on your finest meats silk gown for his mother.
It was a coat color _azul gendarme_ who weeks before had given her
sister Candelaria ... "No, no, that's not ... remove ...». poop ...
And he always insisted, lamp, monísimo. Unbuttons wanted the robe,
and put your hand. Then he head against the breast. Seeing that
achieved nothing, it was serious, so it seemed a very serious man.
Looked ojazos live with their wet and expressing them in the mouth and
in distress in all humanity it. Adam, pitched to paradise, otherwise
do not look good losing. Jacinta wanted to laugh but could not
because he stuck his little inflamed look into the soul. He spent
so much time, the child-man staring at her mother, and slowly melting
it with the strength of the beam from his eyes. Jacinta felt it break
something in his spine. Without knowing what he was doing an off
button ... Then another. But the boy's face never lost its seriousness.
The mother was alarmed y. .. was the third button ...

Nothing, face and the baby always look grim, with a beautiful gravity,
which would be terrible ... The fourth button, the fifth, all buttons
came out of the eyelets making moaning fabric. Lost his mind to let
go of the buttons. Cent were may mil ... Neither of these ... The
face was taking a suspicious immobility. Jacinta, in the end, put his
hand inside her, the boy got what he wished, and he looked sure to be
seen when desenojaría something so rich and so beautiful ... Nothing,
then grabbed the boy's head, attracted to each other and you do not
want to put in your mouth ... but the mouth was insensitive, and the
lips are not moving. Whole face seemed a statue. The contact Jacinta
felt very delicate part of your epidermis, it was shocking the cast
rubbing, rubbing the rough surface and gunpowder. The thrill that you
contact that occurred dejola stunned for a while, then opened his
eyes and took charge of her sisters who were there, saw the curtains
painted the mouth of the theater, the concurrence of the tight side
of paradise. It took a while to realize where I was and the nonsense
that he had dreamed, and threw a hand to the chest with shame and
fear of movement. He heard the orchestra, which was still imitating
the mosquitoes, and by looking at the stage of her husband, Federico
Ruiz saw the great music lover, with his head thrown back, mouth ajar,
hear and taste the delicious fruition vast music the violin with
mute.

It seemed that it was within the mouth of a finer grain of clear and
sweet that it could be imagined. Was the man in a pure ecstasy. Other
music lovers furious saw the lady on the stage, but had already completed
the fourth act and John did not appear. - Iii - If anything happens
to the people deserve a higher event, it is easy for an American
timetable sheet , corresponding to December 73, parrafito found this:
"Day _tantos_: strong cold Juanito Santa Cruz. The impossibility
of staying at home puts you in a mood of two hundred thousand devils.
" I was sitting by the fireplace, wrapped from the waist down in a
blanket that looked like the skin of a tiger, reaching up to the ears
hat in his hand a newspaper, in the chair immediately and three, four,
many newspapers. Jacinta teasing him for his enforced slavery, and
he found amusement in those guasitas, made as it hit, grabbed by
the arm, it blights the beard with his fingers, he shook his head, then
slaps him, terrible blows and then beating in many parts of the body,
and large punctures or thrust with the index finger too stiff.

After stabbing well stitched, cut his head segándole neck,
and yet as if it were not enough brutality, the inhuman and cruelísimas
riddled with tickling, accompanying his blows fierce these words: "What
_guasoncita_ me my baby back ! ... I'm going to teach my clown to
bromitas, and I shall give you a good solfa you do not want to
be disrupted ...». Jacinta was laughing and talking dolphin with a
little serious, he continued: " you know that I am not a street ... A
faith that you can complain. Husbands know that when putting a foot in
the street, pull are three days without appearing in the house.

They could take me for a model. "- Ladybug date tone - Jacinta
replied drying up the tears and the laughter he had shed tickling -. I
know there are others worse, but I do not put my hand in the fire
because you're number one. John shook his head as a sign of threat.
Jacinta was far from his reach, if repeated by the barbaric tickled.
"Requires too much is you," said the man, regretting that his wife
did not have the most perfect of created beings. Jacinta was a moment
of funny with fruncimiento the eyebrows and lips, which meant:
'I do not want to get into discussions with you, because they come
with their hands on their heads. "

Just then the Chouan fire slackened, for, in truth, the whole object
of the skirmish was to give the chevalier an opportunity to utter his
warning to the Gars. Merle, who saw the enemy disappearing across the
hedges, thought best not to follow them nor to enter upon a fight that
was uselessly dangerous. Gerard ordered the escort to take its former
position on the road, and the convoy was again in motion without the
loss of a single man. The captain offered his hand to Mademoiselle de
Verneuil to replace her in the coach, for the young nobleman stood
motionless, as if thunderstruck. Marie, amazed at his attitude, got
into the carriage alone without accepting the politeness of the
Republican; she turned her head towards her lover, saw him still
motionless, and was stupefied at the sudden change which had evidently
come over him. The young man slowly returned, his whole manner
betraying deep disgust.

"Was I not right?" said Madame du Gua in his ear, as she led him to
the coach. (with bursts of extreme concern and anger). I do not
know what to think ... Maxi, Maxi, if I'd taken a shot, I would
have killed it. I swear if it is true, this woman, this hypocrite,
the scoundrel who sold me friendship, was not laughing at me. I swear
you kick the soul soon as I say (rolling on the bed). This can not
continue. The kill him sack his eyes, ripping out the hearts ... I
bring my clothes.

Uncle, kid, I get up. But what I have left! - I understand that you give
so strong. So I gave myself, but then I've become stoic. Learn from me.
Do not you see how calm I am? I've gone through all the crises
of anger, of rage and madness ... - Because you are not a man
(interrupting). - Is that the lessons I have used. - Well, because
you're a saint ... I am not a saint, nor want. - And why would not
you be too? (tomándole hands and gently trying to contain his anger
movements). Why did not aspire to the state where I am? I have come
to him through the anger, the madness ... Now, not long ago, when I
saw this devil of a man committing a new outrage, I felt again the
weakness of spirit that I thought up ... I came wanting to hit a shot,
to rid humanity of such a monster ... But I knew after defeat and
I said: Better a logical consequence that punishes a dagger. - I want
to say that you saw it and stay so cool! - the girl shouted,
furious, throwing flames in the eyes. - I did not stay cool ... I fuss
a lot, but then came the thought. What matters, told me, he is not
dead, but she learns. And you've learned. - Well, if I get to see
... - If you can see, remember me. Become a saint like me ...

We view and raisins ... - You are not man ... You are not nothing -
said the young man with disdain -. To her, this is a knave whom I
would like to fix. If the lame do not mind. ¡Infamous, dragged,
indecent, and fool! - You look good if you have the right to treat
it that way. - Well, I did not have! (Obfuscating completely and move
on without saying). I removed mine. I will be bad, but she is much,
much more. - I understand your elation. I had no other cellphone that
justice, when I saw them when I was persuaded that pecaban, I think if
I have a gun, you loose six shots in the back. - Well, well - the
wife said with ferocity --. Why did not you? You are a fool ... But
then I'd kill myself too. You are entitled to do so. - I saw going
into that house ... Fortunata opened their eyes with horror.
"I waited to see them leave. This street, so many numbers. I hid in
a portal. Oh, the fate of them was carrying a gun not ...». - I'll buy
it ... Today, now (shake it in the bed, taking her son, making
him stop, discovered the chest, tapándoselo and not knowing what to
do). - Kill! ... ¿Lesson to her? What about yours? - Mine, mine? Got
it, silly. Still want more lesson? A treacherous that it is I'm going
to give, and fat. - Going to jail if you kill then I will happy
.-- .-- And your son? On hearing this, Fortunata has a setback in her
wild idea, and taking the boy, who began to grumble, took him to
the breast.

The mother wept, the boy also, and the large Ido again appeared at the
door without saying anything , including a husband and wife with eyes
similar to those of the plaster or marble statues, as it seemed not to
have children in the eyes.

Thanks to the entry of second put an end to the situation and see what
it was that Rubín blow, dropping by mouth that toads and snakes
and laying the blame for everything and his brother Jose tagarote
useless Ido, which being insulted in his view as unreasonably
contractions were almost unbelievable with the muscles of the face,
together with an eye perched on the mouth and another up to the
root of hair.

"I do not know what it is - I said - I do not know what it is, but
today I do not have good head ...

And be entered if it was wanted, which I commanded you not to enter ...
and if killed, will have their reasons, of course ... Go with what this
lady spends genius!, And it treats me how! Do not know who I am?
For I am Josef ... Idumeo ... professor at the birth ... intellectuals'.
- v - 'Shut up you, so _guillati_ - Chill Second, that he made
threatening movements, appeared ready to break up a couple
of slaps on the fragile person _profesor idumeo_ -. The blame
has this sleeping bag is here. "Obra Romans was awakening to
_Platón_, finally, his sister threw him a leg, while Encarnacion
threw the other, and the corpachón of _modelo_, sliding on the sofa
collapsed with a roar on the floor. A while he was stretching, refregándose
eyes with manazas and spitting _hostias_ more than words. 'Where
is the Jew thief who had entered without my awards? Host ¡! That the
delivery by the target. " Second Language desmerecía's not your brother
for the finesse nor the choice of voices, what a very unpleasant Ido.
Maxi went to the lounge, and Jose Izquierdo was barking table like
this: "Oh, it was Usté . Ora same street ... Brrr ... And what
do I have a soft mu ... genius! Because if you get to see soon! Host!
Me if the Holy ... if you get to see before, the Jewish balcony! Host!
will solutes to the street '. Without showing any fear, Maximilian
smiled. Zaragata that was armed, he had to speak in sentences Ido
harmony, and Second manot, throwing the blame calzonazos to his brother,
and lashed out at the Incarnation, and the kid gave Maxi against
rejection, and the drum was such that there was presented at the
door, which was open, Estupinan and entered the house with police
gesture, sending silent throughout the world and threatening to bring
a partner. "I already said that this quarter would not have peace, and
continue as well, soon raised them all in the street." It was
grumbling, and at dusk, when Ido and Maxi had left, and the
brothers were eating Izquierdo, rose once again, with baton, despotically
and said: 'Order, order and the first goal that noise will prison.
- So what, D.

Placido, will come to the Viaticum - Somewhat less - said the
talkative entering without permission and going to the bedroom -.

That will come the love, the lady home.

Much order, gentlemen, a lot of formality. _Platón_ The same was heard
that Ms. Pacheco came to fear him uneasy to see her and had no
longer calm.

A trangullones dispatched food, rushing off to the street. Such was
his fear that the lady he saw, down the stairs to escape, and was
bristling hair thinking that if Guillermina when he climbed down,
would have no where to go to avoid them. From the interview with her
husband, Fortunata was so restless, angry that he had to second to
prevent the lift, because he wanted to do it all costs. Alice Chaos
was the novelty of finding with regard to provisions of mouth,
because he was grumpy, as if I also go to the street, are made.

The announcement of the visit of the holy mother calmed down enough
to, but not the son, who did not understand or even Jack the
sanctities.

Presentose the lady at nine, with Estupinan, and after greeting as if
this Second Mrs encopetada more fell, and before you say anything
to her friend who was considered either Juan Evaristo Segismundo.

A second approach ensures that the lady could see well the factions of
the child, who did not seem excited, let alone with such inspection
or impertinente the sharpness of the light as close to their eyes.
"Evil Genius has! "said the saint sitting beside the bed, while
Fortunata to honor his son, and metiéndole the chest in the mouth,
trying to placate. Guillermina was very economical with greetings and
demonstrations of affection, and then, when we were alone Mrs.

Rubin and the saint, said nothing of this religion, nor creased
virtue nor sin, nor anything relating to the moral order.

He talked about whether the young mother had a lot of milk or not,
and whether you felt this or other trouble with other things relevant
to the state it was.

Fortunata noticed calm in the face of the founder studied some
severity, and to break those ice, said the following, which time
could doubt: "This really is the legitimate _Pituso_ the Javiera's
own aunt, do you, madam?

Oh, do you know? As my uncle Joseph heard that you had left a career
as a soul that takes the devil. "- I fear I have. Gave good ... Let
you be, as I take in hand, I have to say four things. And when the
mother put the child at his side, already tired and sleepy, Guillermina
him again look carefully, observing her features as the numismatic
notes fuzzy profile and the old markings of a coin to see if it is
authentic or counterfeit. Then gave a sigh, and winking his eyes
to look at Fortunata was expressed thus: 'We have made good, good
!...».

And both were silent for a while, looking. - Lady - said the unexpectedly
Parida, as if to break a secret that overwhelms -. I have to ask you
for forgiveness ... - To me, sorry ... What?

- Of donkeys I did, I said the atrocities in his home that morning
to you. Also ask forgiveness if she saw ... My bad, I know. I do not
keep a grudge against anyone ... I say, do not keep it, because
... Oh, madam, you do not know what happens, you do not know who we
are cheating the two ... I know who it is that it entertains us, a
snake, a hipocritona, I sold friendship ...! This is not so, madam,
is not so ... - Do not you bring me to my account, I did not give cold
or heat (with gracious rebuke). Now it is calm for you, that time of
reckoning is delayed again ... and watch the boy, quietly enjoying
its beauty and freshness. Fortunata he drank to her eyes, boasting
to guess the thought, which could well be this: 'If you saw Jacinta
...!».

But how would you see? This really was impossible. "For me - the
thought _Pitusa_ - no problem ...

But how much the Poor will suffer if you go! And you may be craving ...
Yes, she was ... Friend of mine, take, take ... This is how he'll
continue, you will say: 'The mouth is so eye roast, and it looks
like his father and the other to his mother.

Most perfect creature God has not cast the world '. "" When you're
good, speak - said the holy spirit now withdrawn -.

I have an idea ... You are not alone who have ideas, just that mine
are not bad, at least not have them for such. And to conclude for
today, do you need anything? If you can not breed, do not rush, you'll
love this one alicia, which I think would not make Ascos. It must criarle
good. "- I can, I can ...

Oops - another said the opposite -. What do you think? I am very strong.
My son is not anyone raising more than I do. - Well, eating well
(recovering mildly authoritarian tone).

Be careful to make nonsense. Obey the doctor ... Nothing displays
of anger or devaneos. Oh, I doubt much you serve ... and a feeling of
those bursts of inspiration that embellished and sublimated, told
this, and stood to leave, "Because you will know that God has made
me guardian of this son ...

Yes, good girl, do not scare me or make those ojazos.

His mother is you, but I'm on it a share of authority. God has given
me.

If your mother was missing, I get another engagement, and grandmother.
My son, you've come to the world with blessing, because whatever
happens, will never be alone. You let her see you again. I am tired
of looking. I llevármele stuck in my eyes. ¡Virgen del Carmen!, What
is beautiful ...! Who have quit. Bye, bye '. Estupinan left with, how
to pray, saying: "abide by the will of God ... He knows why he sent
this Angel here. Jacinta, mad, says that God is chocho and simply
nonsense ... Poor ... How limited our intelligence! We understand
nothing, but nothing of what He does, and we windings brain to guess
the meaning of certain things happen, and the more laps we least
understand. So I cut back and all my _matemáticas_ are reduced to
saying: 'do the will of the Lord.

Fortunata dreamed that night that fell Aurora, Guillermina and
Jacinta, armed with knives and black masks, and threatened to kill
her you took your son.

Aurora was the only after committing the heinous crime, entering on
tiptoe into the bedroom, giving a sniff menjurje cursed handkerchief
soaked in the drugstore, and leaving it as sleeping, without movement,
but with ability to appreciate what was happening.

Aurora picked the boy and took him away without his mother could
stop, not even scream. Acongojadísima awoke. She felt bad, prone
to delusions of the mind as soon as lethargic, and with great
thirst. This became so strong, that can not wake her aunt giving the
knuckles on the wall, which was finally lifted in search of
water. Upon returning to bed felt quite cold, and these alternatives
were cold and heat until the morning. - Vi - Ballester was early,
as it lacked time to discuss the visit of Maxi and history
that this had carried. Much the regent is upset to learn this, and
with unusual earnestness and warmth had to deny what his friend
contara of _The Samaniega_. "Look, mate - she said - the more you
stack you deny it, I think more on it. You do not ever speak well, and
when he gets serious, said more than lies. You want me serene. I
appreciate it, but can not be. And what is that filthy francesilla
not laugh at me. "Exhausted all his good friend and removed the logical
idea, without advancing anything. And finally - said taking the
festive tone with thugs employed by Maxi on another occasion - what
do you say if that unfortunate ...

Oh how romantic ... and what Supit _semos_ My friend Rubin, these
appearances now as a man of brains, is _tocati_ more than ever. All
I said upside down, the other day I argued that _doña Desdémona_
is a beautiful woman.

I think if we continue down this path, I will have to bring me here
...». rod Fortunata did not affect the jokes. Observábala it serious
attention, noting that a very sinister and relentless domination, and
was not easily removed from the head. Feared that that mood influenced
negatively on their health and to prevent metiole fear. "I Quevedo
said that these days you must be very careful with you, and you will
not get up until next week. Any nonsense you would make us bad. So,
my daughter (tomándole hands), very careful. I would not do it
for me. What case do you make of this poor boticarín? None, and
rightly so, because I am nobody to you ... do it by my friend Juan
Evaristo, who I already like it was my son, yes, sepal you and me,
at its guardian; do it for him, and _tutti contenti_.

"He seemed convinced, and Ballester left with the impression of
having triumphed. Was quiet all morning, but around noon, on
waking from a dream soon he felt so strongly desire to push out into
the street, who could not overcome this blind impulse. Got up
with great surprise of Encarnación, the only person in the room was,
it was a comb and lightly put her dark merino skirt, black crepe scarf,
another color to the head, red mittens, boots his cane clear, y. ..
But before leaving a great time spent with his son, who, having
woken when the mom is wearing, it seemed to declare that their
shrieks salidita the charges. Convinced him giving it everything
we wanted or what he had, and the angel fell asleep in his cradle of
twigs. "Look - Encarnacion told her loves - and I'm going to leave.
But not be out shortly, because taking a car, I will diligently
and in half an hour.

You do not separas here, and if the child wakes him and lulled him
months, saying that I come in ... seguidita care how you separas
him.

Hey, while I am outside, not open to anyone ... Better otherwise
I would close by and took me two turns the key.

Second Coming, to wait on the stairs. " Gave many kisses his son,
who for the first time on that occasion was separated, and left,
closing the door and took the key.

"Not a thing that someone comes y. .. No, I do not lose it, but
there have been cases. This angel of mine, I see that many have a
sweet tooth. And above all that of Jacinta envidiosona is what gives
me more fear. Of which the fuzz is going to leave more hair and is going
to be like a thin wire.

But what choice is satisfied, but ...? I have punished myself enough
... now that her penis. Oh, sorry steps. Frankly, I would not want
anyone to see me because they start to say that if I go or not go
out, and I do not like _refirencias_.

I think it is D. Plácido that up. I keep a little bit until you come
into your home ... Since arriving, he opened his door. Now slip me,
join me and God. Should carry something that hurts ... Ah, the key.
The hand is better than the pestle. With this and the nails ... I
swear ...». Took a car and took him just felt so dizzy, due to the
movement and his own weakness, which had to close my eyes and tilt
your head to avoid seeing the houses turning around yours. "I should
have made a soup before you go ... But I remember a good time. Anyway,
this will happen. " Indeed happened, and the first thing he did was
to reset the change order was given to Simon. Habíale said _Ave Mary,
18_, but had an idea, and said _Cabeza, 10_, making theirs out of
the window, extending the arm and playing with the key in his hand
carried, like a weapon, the arm of the coachman.

Its disjointed stones and paneless windows, the battered
tower and broken roofs gave it the aspect of a skeleton; the birds of
prey which flew from it, shrieking, added another feature to this
vague resemblance. A few tall pine-trees standing behind the house
waved their dark foliage above the roof, and several yews cut into
formal shapes at the angles of the building, festooned it gloomily
like the ornaments on a hearse. It is clear that for whatever doña Luz
could not have anything remotely in common with love. But by the same
token, his affection for the Father had to stay, and demonstrations
of affection that should not be stopped or mitigated, thus she was
inclined to believe they were the very essence of what was the husband
of his soul future, as it had been and inconstant whim, he had put
in a not so free as intact as ever given to anyone who treasured
caring heart, but something or much of what he had before given to
another and then quitádoselo .

So, strove Doña Luz, but in vain, because as always affable and
affectionate with Fr Enrique. And seeing as it could not, seeing as
it's touching your soul with the Father, and by the word, and the
gaze, when before it seemed that spring heat and magnetic fire, then
ice is formed, it was explained assuming that no effect on brilliance
or human hearts for several affections, and that, where a rule,
others faint and fall, even of very different nature and condition.
The soul of the father continued to doña Luz always clear, transparent
and impenetrable, the deep sea that embraces film and the Andalusian
coast.

The sun passes through many layers of water and everything is full of
clarity, but there in the deepest, it darkens and loses sight
between iris, reflections, Argentine litmus and lightning, and
nothing distinguishes accurately and fixity.

Father had not changed in appearance at least. The same serenity, the
same sweetness as ever. Do not alter your voice to speak of D.

Or Jaime D. Jaime.

In speaking with Dona Luz, the former showed the Father loving kindness.
Not a word which is felt even remotely a tip irony of pique or spite.
"O Father has it on its own a domain implausible - Doña Luz thought
- or not I ever loved.

One would suspect that Manuel, who I heard as full of malicious
slander villainy, was in essence a creation of my ridiculous vanity,
which, though the matter further, I am flattered instead of angry.

No, there is no good Fr Enrique I felt that I had in high regard,
thanks to his great indulgence, I want as a neighbor of choice,
but everything else is absurd dream, my imagination is presumed.

And better so. "Doña Luz and end with these words, to let off sighs,
as one who removes severe weight lifted. On other occasions, even more
eager to download his consciousness, to decline all responsibility,
but by the previous reasoning had shown that it itself was in
no way liable to get out of trouble, Mrs. Light was gone in his memory
all the favors he had done to the Father was removing all worth
and significance to the demonstrations of affection that had given
him, and This would reduce everything to the narrow proportions of
a severe cold and friendship, as we can and must mediate between a
teacher and a disciple, affirms it or deleting from any embarrassing
memories, false in its feel, even the slightest flirtation unconscious
from it.

In the meantime, spent the days and was close to the wedding, which was
to be no apparatus.
"You have a singular way of dispelling suspicion," he said.

"Do you still suspect me?" she replied, looking him in the eye, as if
to say, "What rights have you over me?"

"Mademoiselle," said the young man, in a voice that was submissive and
yet firm, "the authority you exercise over Republican troops, this
escort--"

"Ah, that reminds me! My escort and I," she asked, in a slightly
satirical tone, "your protectors, in short,--will they be safe here?"

"Yes, on the word of a gentleman. Whoever you be, you and your party
have nothing to fear in my house."

The promise was made with so loyal and generous an air and manner that
Mademoiselle de Verneuil felt absolutely secure as to the safety of
the Republican soldiers. She was about to speak when Madame du Gua's
approach silenced her. That lady had either overheard or guessed part
of their conversation, and was filled with anxiety at no longer
perceiving any signs of animosity between them. As soon as the marquis
caught sight of her, he offered his hand to Mademoiselle de Verneuil
and led her hastily towards the house, as if to escape an undesired
companion.

"I am in their way," thought Madame du Gua, remaining where she was.
She watched the lovers walking slowly towards the portico, where they
stopped, as if satisfied to have placed some distance between
themselves and her. "In the middle of this agrarian angle to the
agitation of the party as good as had been inaccessible because
there is no local assemblies for their disposal, the construction
workers had their own house built. The Local refused them while fully
licensed, but they had a roof over his head, a free space to free
speech.

"They had the farmers to see how our house one o'clock-two o'clock -
three, haste nich jesehn! Sandkule out from the rose, "said Merten."
We had only Sundays Arbeet time, but it flew so Steene. On Sunday
in eenem early, when it Jusow went to church, we started to dig in,
and when after the last amen again passed, the walls were already out
of the earth! "The car stopped. The whole place was fully human. They
pushed me behind in the small room, on the benches along the walls
were already women with hot faces. I spoke of the storm, out of
the dust swept from the roofs and everything Morsch pulled to the
ground. And from the storm of socialism. I described the political
situation in Germany and one of the sins of the Government and the
Reichstag majority of prison on course to customs robbery, I told
of the billions to the poor man in the form of indirect taxes,
duties and love gifts from the small bag should be considered, while
his woman at home on a small budget sighing with every penny be
expected.

At the hands of the bourgeois scholar studies, I demonstrate how
the cost of food on the increase in alcoholism, crime, acts of
pulmonary tuberculosis.

I pulled out the medical research to show how people of all circles
degenerate if the diet is inadequate, "weak willed, faster failing
attention, rapid exhaustion are the consequences of a policy, the
welfare of the people, the love of the fatherland constantly mouth
leads, in fact, but the performance of workers undermines, our
position on the world shaken.

The economic crisis, which we all suffer from the rise in unemployment,
with her entourage of children and women exploitation jammers are
proof.

No "armored fist" can save us from ... Once in the course of five years
it has been granted any Germans, talking about judgments on those who
are his fate.

Of the people suffering and oppression is on the one shell of the wage,
the people happiness and freedom on the other. We, the 'homeland
persons', we the' meek ', we, the' brood of people, not worth the
name Deutsche to 'make our decision depends on which side of the Wage
serious ... "I was motionless listening to the women, with their hands
folded in lap, the men, without the sight of me to apply. Only here
and there I saw a affirmative nod. The people of this barren
earth wore his heart on his lips and knew nothing of the reaction of
sensitive nerves, often reflecting the whole of the city there is
applause.

But afterwards, when I no longer have them stand and was preceded by a
question and telling, it is more than any clapping showed how every
word from the thirst of their soil was added inside. Of course: in
the closest circles own life turned their interests, but any
enclosed the great suffering of the world. I was led to workers'
houses: so small, so poor, so closely.

"And here is yet ville sand on which jut another ten houses could
be," They showed me the poor house in a tiny room resided an ancient
couple with four young grandchildren. The only bed was almost half
the room a. "Always, from Kleen on, here we have uf'n jut jearbeetet,"
said the man, a figure shrunk to a small brown face like a root
tuber, »nu's Jnadenbrot we eat -- -, "while he giggled half
embarrassed, half-mockingly. »Castle but Det, det has wanted to
fufzich empty rooms ..."

We went through the dark night to the village railway station. One,
the youngest of the flock, with a clear voice began to sing. Gradually
the others fell. The doors of the houses in which we vorüberkamen,
opened. Some curious residents came to the threshold. Others drew
the song and the moist and warm March night - they followed us. And
so it went in the bar on the street and always, always been more
people singing the train. "We are young, the old hammer rotten
thing, the state, the wrath of God we are - the proletariat - the
proletariat -- "It sounded blaring out over the sleeping fracture.
Gradually, the more I land and its inhabitants nähertrat won, I loved
it, and the vast plain to me revealing all their hidden beauty,
its people and the soft, defiant heart. You have not yet felt the
distance between you and me, so I never met envy or distrust. They
started but hardly to the Allerhandgreiflichste to feel: like the
contrast of their hut to palace rule.

And it is precisely at this point in their education, I saw where I
had to intervene. "Who will create other conditions, it was only
the pressure of their own learning experience," I said to Romberg,
who sent me my agitational activities by verleiden wanted.

"I can Let me now do not imagine, in a village pub preaching
discontent, "he replied, annoyed." To convince yourself through appropriate
inspection, that I can, "I said.

On my next trip, he came with. This time it was a car conductor, of
us in pouring rain falling on land after a small village drove
Lehmann Höfel with names. "How is it with our meeting with the
weather?" I asked the old comrades of us on the train had received.
" jut - very jut, "he said. »What is our oller pastor who has vorichte
week ufjehetzt women. You should not just be in the Assembly Jehn,
he jesagt so wat jing they threw on to jar, on wenichsten when 'a
woman is talking, who prefer to house det lunch of bread and cook

Nu Se can imagine that in the se justament Jehn Assembly. Proppenvoll's
already morje. "Cyclists met us, from top to bottom bespritzt,
pedestrians with loose soles, where the water dripped from the
cap. We invited to present as much of the car could hold. Since
the dawn, they had flyers out. Fully good humor they told their
adventures. On many a farm, they had to climb over fences, because
the door was locked before them, one was a boy up the craft traveling
in the offices of Knights Gesinde vorgedrungen goods, the other
had with humility face as wär's a Traktätchen the Kirchgängern the
slip in the hand is pressed, in Vorübersausen cyclist they had sent
through open doors and windows thrown.

In a restaurant by Lehmann Höfel glowed the iron furnace. Wet coats
and boots dried out. Tobacco smoke was heavy in swaths of the low
ceiling. My place was with pine branches umwunden. Before me stood
on the table right and left, two bouquets of flowers in flat white
paper sleeves. "From the day laborer to the inner jut -," said a
young dark blushing girl, as the last vestiges of the old costumes,
the straw-blond lichens under the black silk scarf had hidden. As in
the church, people sat in front of me right at the men left the
women - all faces, in which no other thought than to the plight of
the next life his character had dug.

Never has been a gathering here. Whether I would find the sound that
came to them? I told of their own existence, as in eternal Gleichmaß
dahinfließt, according to the old monotonous tune: Living to work,
work, in order to be able to live again. How fun for them just a short
rush with evil is awakening - an alcohol intoxication, a love noise -
and the concerns they never left alone.

As the world full of splendor and beauty, as the largest and most beautiful
in terms of humanity in centuries of thought and felt, in thousands
of books and statues and paintings were kept for their offspring.
"But a wall built around it, and only he who possesses the golden wand,
which opens the door ..." A young man who was a bit dull sat in front
of me had suddenly saw - with a few eyes in which deep longing
flared. "The child of poor Tagelöhnerin has perhaps the soul of a
poet - with fourteen years, it must dig potatoes and turnips draw, and
the work meets with their feet beaten ironless complained his soul
dead ..." At the door over there, I saw an old woman with the white
head sobbing in the bony hands buried. "In this world, poverty is a
crime that is punished with a life of forced labor is ... Above are
enough tears have been shed. Before a loud whining, we have forgotten
the action. Down from the pulpit, they preached that the acquiescence

subservience, the inertia of our ... Each glance at the pale face

"Using examples of everyday life, I looked for them to make clear how
each individual, even the most modest to the great liberation campaign
of socialism can participate, as he never would lead to goals without
the work of the individual. I was when I heard the breath of
the people before me and sighs. O, that I still would have taken to
heart! Moisture mist hung like a long black veil over the fields. We
drove silently back. Frostgeschüttelt I leaned into the cushions,
as we finally take the train to Berlin had climbed. "How you can be
responsible," Romberg broke off, which had not a word spoken and the
poor people, among whom he had sat, his unease as clearly feel
guilty that I have regretted to have him taken away. Now I went from
the half-on. "I do not understand," I said. "So much worse," he cried.
"They take these people the only thing they possess, what they
made life bearable: their ignorance, their stump sense - without
giving them anything to give them."

"How, the awakening from the lethargy would be nothing!" I replied
hotly. "Getting through the participation in the relief work of the
class members about himself and his little destiny hinauszuheben,
- that would be nothing! From you I first heard the word of the policy
of the Strong. That is my guiding principle. Without disturbing the
disharmonies of the pain, without the cruelty of knowledge there is
not a strong chord of their solution. "" And how about those who are
to perish? "" It would also be based on life gone! "With a strange
look to me to my own amazement woe did, he touched me. "Is
softness and weakness, also you have an attribute of femininity?" I
asked, and the heart beat me, when I feared the answer.

"I do not know quite -, "he said hesitantly. "But that our friendship
will not suffer shipwreck." "Have you no time for me?" He
began after a break to speak again, as the train approached
Berlin already. I looked at. "I would like to see you back at
least between human culture will be," Without the right desire, only
to return him to injure him, I promised myself the next day his
leadership to "culture" to entrust.

At the station we were Heinrich, an hour earlier from a different
area of his constituency had returned.

We were both so full of our experiences that we in the heat of
storytelling Romberg almost forgot.

He took his stiff and out of tune. "Education and politics are for
me the most difficult concepts -," he said the next morning when
we went into town.

"You seem a change of subject to moods, which has allowed only one
wife was, "I said annoyed.

"It is not so long ago that you have a passion that I have not
forgotten, the social democracy as the most significant phenomenon
of the time to celebrate."

He smiled. »Women's logic! I'm probably properly, these women train
with you to find! What's my verdict on the class struggle of the
proletariat with my opinion about the participation of the educated
in politics to do? We should struggle to higher levels - "" Is
there more than the liberation of humanity from all the fetters which
they forge to the Earth and their rise to inhibit? "I broke him
excited." Liberty, equality, fraternity, -- - the old slogan, which
already gestürmt was the Bastille, "he replied with a mocking
smile," You still add the ideal of Christianity, - the selbstentsagende
love, that proves it all, as a time of unspeakable poverty must be
the even such a huge movement like that of the proletariat has no
new ideals can create.

"His words met a more ambiguous feeling that I so vigorously sought
to suppress had me as the dark paths were published, on which it could
have led. We joined in the modern art salon in Berlin. The wooden
arches of the entrance hall, which in its curved lines all of the
material brittleness victoriously overcome was received with wide
open arms to visitors.

In bright displays, by invisible light shining from inside the donor,
was on a gray velvet belts, buckles, bracelets and diadems, bird
feathers and butterfly wings made of transparent email united with a
dark gold, matte silver, pearls were in fantastic shapes besides
unheard gems of colors -- "A fairy tale jewelry for princesses,
from an established poet," Romberg said admiringly, and sunken in
the sight.

He liked white and shining arms commemorate neck holder and woman
laughing heads with lips and fragrant curls. In my eyes, but other
images liability: chapped hands, stooped back, sorgendurchfurchte
faces - I turned from me, in the innermost injured. The next room was
full of soft light and deep, soft armchair. "How pleasant, how
calm," said someone. "A nice old lady with very white hands should
breastfeed their lives here verträumen evening." But the office of
arms Platkow I saw before me. In a big picture, we were then: on soft,
blumendurchwirktem lawn, located in the quiet woods and lost a tender
Source surrounded that this peace does not want to disturb Plätscherlaut,
knelt a young man, the dark Dante andachtsvoll head raised to the
Virgin.

From the porch of the temple kicking, they crowned him long, narrow,
translucent pale fingers held the wreath.

Girl, so slim and majestic as she stood to the side. And all shone in
the mystical blue, purple in drunken, rich in green, - away
from all shades of gray of reality. Almost took the foreign Wunderwelt
me prisoner.

Since the sturmdurchpeitschte Park appeared before me and the rough man,
with hard working hands tenderly stroked the little buds.

I was very monosyllabic. We decided the day in the theater, where
Maeterlinck Pelleas and Melisande under the direction of a young
revolutionary stage was performed.

Böcklin landscapes seemed alive has become the magic forest and the
rocks, the dark castle and towers of white marble fountains coalesced
with the floating figures, the sun shine and the moon to the pure
rhythm of moving art.

The noisy street outside destroyed the dream.

With painful clarity, I felt the yawning gap between all of the
aesthetic culture, which for us began to blossom forth, and the
life, thought and desires of millions who only started to the
satisfaction of primordial shoots to fight.

Romberg met to my thoughts. "Do you not even like weltenfern where
you are, all of which require more time in something a little more
bread culminates?" He said. »You need your senses, your nerves, to
their subtle refinement generations worked, blunt force to ensure
their voice will be able to."

My whole joyousness returned to me again.

"How closely you might think," I laughed. "Not dull, I must increase
my sensitivity, so I always know how much is lacking and how to profit
tremendously our struggle." "Do as not at all clear that if the mass
should achieve what you have today You and your peers to back
her one thousand years are ahead! "said Romberg. "So the gap will
remain - remain, and equality is a chimera." "I ask only the equality
of living conditions, such as the tree grows from the ground, is
to decide on its own strength," I replied.

We broke a conversation, which we only had to remove from each
other. But a thought had awakened, who now no longer allowed to
sleep.

When he tormented me and I wanted him off so he just drilled deeper
into the brain and heart. Audible, such as the people migrated to their
new home ground to conquer the Earth booms under the kicks of the
millions who had set in motion in order to escape the misery. But
they lacked the wool uniform formula. The triumvirate of the
revolutionary ideals was not.

And what Marx had given them, which were scientific explanations
about the nature, pace and the goal of the movement, only for so
long about the lack could obscure as they were unshaken.

An event encouraged me in my idea.

Located in the election campaign, all of our energies on one goal
- the defeat of the enemy - would need to concentrate, resulted in
a desert war between the party members themselves he would have
been impossible if not that lack of internal unity to the mutual
mistrust have had.

What a quiet conscience did or did that appeared the other as a breach
of the party. A half-dozen party members - I was among them - had
been a year and a day at a bourgeois Wochenschrift cooperated,
which was a tribune, all directions on the words came freely.

The literary and artistic criticism, which I had published it, -
now works, which I no longer than a moment of interest attached, -
often had less need for the debate, as the acquisition forced to
owe their emergence.

The party press was my only rarely available, and so rare, the more
I was suspicious of revisionism.

In a similar situation as I had most of those who are with me
'sinned' had.

Two of them stood as a candidate in the Reichstag fire of violent
election campaign.

But that prevented some radical leaders not to us in the widest
public as a carrier of the opposing train press suspicious. No sooner
had I read the article, as I have sat at the desk to help us defend
against it. The view that we must use every grandstand, from which
we can be heard, had been in me since the time when I do, by Wanda
Orbin influenced the face of the woman denied Congress had just
fastened. Our press, our Assembly speeches always reached the same
circles, and stood off hundreds of thousands to us only from the
representations of the enemy to know. I placed my statement before
the affected.

It should appear in the same newspaper that had attacked us. I was
unable to, we wanted to extend the strife should be avoided by the
public response, as I had intended, in a letter to the party executive
turned.

But this was no longer able, to an internal dispute raised -- Press
the whole had been the case usurps our political opponents slaughtered
them against us - he published his decision: no party Genosse may
collaborate on a journal, the Social Democracy in gloating or
spiteful way criticized.

The entire province of course, the press printed succinct sentences
from the board.

We were branded before the comrades, in the middle of which we
should act, the opponents were the weapons in the hand delivered
to us prior to discredit them.

It passed us laugh, which is basically the correct answer would
have been.

We saw in the decision, which each party leader at the hand were
mißliebige sheets on the index to set a further step to Papismus, we
indignant us that even those who in the party in office and bread
were the freedom writers the earnings had to go, the membership of
the party to make it impossible for searched, and one of their bases
seemed to us in the attack on the freedom of expression.

We defector from the bourgeoisie in the fight against all authority -
the family, education, religion, the state - the path to social
democracy had found, would be the last to establish a new authority
- that of Party Executive Committee, - to recognize.

And my husband, his Frondeurnatur Least deny, was our speaker against
him: in an outrage in article, he defended the freedom of expression.
Now only the fighting erupted, since the party already in
Munich quiet the ghosts were heated, all along the line, - with
all the bitterness that arises when friends are enemies.

In quiet we were afraid of what our political opponents hoped :
that the election is to our disadvantage that could be affected. *
* * * * On the first day of May, the World Labor Day, I should in
Frankfurt a.

O. The festival speech. I was at the moment little festive feast,
with so much Hoffnungsfreudigkeit I had the agitation started -
it should have been in vain?

Should I at the end of their failure to blame, because I - it sounded
like a joke stupid buffoon - in a journal on Civil and Plays Half
Marholms wife Laura had written books?

But just as the train station the last berliner hall and left instead
of the high gray houses outside porch to porch ranked, from the
first Green überhaucht young, with colorful flags bewimpelt funny,
and people in festive clothes on the road between young birches,
the greeting the green veil their branches moving, the Assemblies
entgegeneilten in which their faith spring resurrection message
should be preached, vanished all my foolish petty fears.

What did the dogmatic squabbling with the priests of the religion
of the masses to do?

Two little girls welcomed me at the station, with blue ribbons in
the Zöpfchen white and freshly laundered clothes, they are concerned
about bauschten, so they looked like giant bell flowers.

Pille-Miche went out to fetch the barrel of cider, which
the marquis had ordered for the escort; and Marche-a-Terre was passing
along the side of the coach, to leave the barn and close the door,
when he was stopped by a hand which caught and held the long hair of
his goatskin. He recognized a pair of eyes the gentleness of which
exercised a power of magnetism over him, and he stood stock-still for
a moment under their spell. Francine sprang from the carriage, and
said, in the nervous tone of an excited woman: "Pierre, what news did
you give to that lady and her son on the road? What is going on here?
Why are you hiding? I must know all."

These words brought a look on the Chouan's face which Francine had
never seen there before. The Breton led his innocent mistress to the
door; there he turned her towards the blanching light of the moon, and
answered, as he looked in her face with terrifying eyes: "Yes, by my
damnation, Francine, I will tell you, but not until you have sworn on
these beads (and he pulled an old chaplet from beneath his goatskin)
--on this relic, which /you know well/," he continued, "to answer me
truly one question."

Francine colored as she saw the chaplet, which was no doubt a token of
their love. "It was on that," he added, much agitated, "that you
swore--"

He did not finish the sentence. Was so beautiful to make this statement,
which looked much the Rubín before saying: "No, no jures no need
to swear.

I believe you. Say something else.

And if we come through that door and you say: 'Fortunata, see' Will
you go? ". Fortunata looked at the door.

Rubín swallow and search the site where we have something to wring the
mustache, and finding only a very thin hairs, the cruelly martyred.

"That ... ...-- as she said folding her entrecejo -.

I would go or not I would go ...». - ii - Maximilian wanted to know
everything. It was like the good doctor asks the patient the bad
news that minor patient and his history to know how to cure. Fortunata
not hiding anything, that was good, and the doctor lover was sometimes
necessary for more perhaps for the prodigious cure.

And what shocked to hear what went wrong that carries the seductive
beauty of that!

The honradísimo apprentice pharmacist did not understand that there
may be as bad men, and all the penalties of hell to punish parecíanle
few. That the most evil criminal murderers and thieves were,
according to him, the gentleman of seductive poor girl who made her
believe she was going to marry her, and then planted in the left
half of the stream with their kid or the eve.

How he would do this, Maximiliano Rubín ... Such Juanito Santa Cruz,
therefore, was the most infamous men, more despicable and vile we could
imagine. But it is not very much offended, as seemed natural anathemas
against the seducer, whom Maximilian had reason to redouble
their fury against him, calling him monster and other very bad things.
Fortunata veíase forced to repeat it, but had no means to say the word
_monstruo_.

He was going through as many others, and at last, after thousand
attempts seemed nausea, bonitísimos let go from their teeth and
lips, as if to spit.

Preferred to particularities of their childhood. His late father had a
drawer in the square and was honest man.

Her mother had, as a second, her paternal aunt, trafficking in eggs.
Llamábanla it from the girl _Pitusa_ because it was very rickety
and encanijada up to twelve years, but suddenly took a big growth
spurt and became a woman of class and panache.

His parents died when she was twelve ... Maximiliano Oía these things
with great pleasure. But with all the grain that was mandábala
to serious things, as regards the child had had. When part of this
story was told, the couple lacked little to jump to it tears.
The tender without creature under your poor mother, the grief of
being abandoned, they were indeed a very sad picture that started
my heart.

Why not cited in court? Is what should have been. To these must be treated
tunantes the stick. Otherwise. Why did not you give it a scandal,
go to the home with the kid in her arms and presented to Barbara
and D.

Baldomero clarita well there and tell them the grace that had made
her son ...

But no, this would not have been very consistent with dignity. Worth
more despicable, given to letting their conscience, yes, his
conscience that he had a good racket to arm sooner or later.

Fortunata, on hearing this, his eyes fixed on the floor, repeating
like a machine that which was best scorn.

Yes, despicable, repeated the other, it was shame to request
protection. Although he gave what he gave, was not able to say
Fortunata _ignominia_. Maximiliano insisted he had been under a
great need to ask Juanito Santa Cruz, to that infamous when she
returned to Madrid and you lost your child sick. " But, silly, if
not for him we would not have had to be buried, "said Fortunata
going to defend his own executioner. - First I let him insepulto,
resort ...

The dignity, the daughter, is above everything. Look well to this.
What I know now is what this guy was who you UNISTE later, you
pulled out of Madrid and took you from town to town like a garage
show. - It was a treacherous and evil man - he said with reluctance
Fortunata as if the recollection of that part of his life he was
very unpleasant -.

I went with him because I was lost, and had no where to go back.

He was the brother of a neighbor of ours in the Cava de San Miguel.
First was a drawer casquería in the square, and then put the hardware
store would be fair to all the endless coffers full of trinkets,
and assembled tents.

He called _Juárez the negro_ to have the very dark color. Seeing
so badly, I gave the earth, and that was going to happen already. My
aunt drove me to the house and my uncle is gone.

I was sick, and Juarez told me that if I went with him, I take baths.

He said he earned heaps and mountains in the pilgrimages, and that I was
going to be like a queen. You could not marry me because he was
married, but in quantitative his wife was dying, that was a Dog,
meet, whether man, meet me. Remained relatively quickly and the page
ugly looking finish soon. The gentleman from Santa Cruz is so disastrous,
it dealt with prolixity and even bitter with some complacency, but it
_Juárez of the negro_ leaving her lips as a coerced confession or
testimony in court, those who are burning the mouth as leave. How much
weight you put in the hands of that man!

Was lost, a tern, a bad person. Had resisted to follow, if you pushed
it with relatives who lived, who did not want to keep fuckin peak.

It soon became apparent that everything that was offered
_Juárez the negro_ conversation.

Not winning quarter, with the whole world assembled quarrel, and
all the poison that was amassing in their souls cursed by bad luck,
you download it on his beloved ...

Anyway, life is not dragged past she never had or expected to happen
... With the money they gave Juanito Santa Cruz, when they were in
Madrid and the little boy died, could have the very beast of Juarez
settle their trade, but what did?

Drinking and more drinking. The vinasse aguardientazo and finish it. One
morning she woke up to hearing some great grunts ... and if you were
pressing the tragadero. What was it? That was dying. He jumped out of
bed horrified, and called the neighbors. There was no time _suministrarle_
and only caught the Anointing.

This happened in Lerida. For two days, they sold their junk and four
rooms which could plantose together in Barcelona. He had sworn not
to deal with animals. Freedom, liberty and freedom was what he
was told the body and soul. The truth above all. Why say one thing for
another? Openness is a virtue when there are no others, and openness
required to Fortunata to testify in the first season of moral
anarchy had some fun, forget their sorrows and forget the drunkards.

Its success was great, and their lack of education helped cegarla.
He came to believe that much siltation took revenge on those who
had lost, and used to think that if the rogue was the Santa Cruz
made an arm of the sea, as triumphant elegantona, antojaría love
him again.

But yes, he was ...! It went on to many things, that Maximilian felt
hurt.

Had an accuracy of _echar veil, _ as they say the rhetoric on the part
of the history of his beloved.

The veil had to be very dense because of the frankness Fortunata
acute shed light on the events in question, and his picturesque
language made them reverberate ...

She then gave some cuts to their relationship, and not eating the
letters, but whole paragraphs and chapters, and here is what he said
in substance: Torrellas, the famous Catalan landscape was so jealous
not to let live.

Armándole torments invented thousand traps to see if they fell or
did not fall. We become so hateful man, who finally left her fall.
Metiose purposely taken in, knowledge, like playing a game at the
very silly, because it comes from the many that he had played it.

And nothing more ... Total, which nearly kills the painter
convicted of trees ... The most burning infidelity was that this was
an intimate friend, also a painter, author of the picture of David
looking a. .. Fortunata not remember the name, but was one that was
swimming ...

Neither of the two artists she wanted, for neither would have two
quarters, when bought with money.

Them worth more than his paintings. Since the first deceived the
second, he put on his head the idea of the two pegársela with
another, and satisfaction of this desire is the employee provided a
young, poor and something nice that looked a lot like Juanito Santa
Cruz . ... Another veil Maximilian was made clear to throw another veil
... "Shut up, do me a favor and shut up" he said, thinking that,
as the story went out, he needed at least a piece of tulle. But
she continued to narrate. Well as I was saying, that the couple
also left a good point. One morning while she slept, he pawned all his
jewelry to play. And this peace ... Next came an old man who gave him
money and took her to Paris where he was extraordinarily decked
and honed his taste for dressing. Old Cuckoo more! ... Carcunda
general had been in another war, and dealt a lot with people
cassock. It was very vicious and gave him many headaches with
_tantismas_ tasks as before. One day she was burned and planted in the
street.

Successor, Camps, which he called home with a great course. It
seemed very rich man, but turned out it was a trap-long. Before coming
to Madrid gave her smell of heavy rain and a bit of being here was
that the storm was over. Camps bring recommendations to the Director
of Treasury notes and wanted to charge a fake rifles that were
supposed purchased by the Government. Came home one night very petulant,
lashing a small suitcase, llenola clothes, Fortunata requested
all the money he had and said I was going to the Escorial. Escorial
was, that has not appeared. The rest either knew Maximiliano ...
The Camps had been succeeded him, and he was known as a glow in their
eyes the pride that the inheritance will occur. Because he was very
clear that Fortunata. Thank God he found his way into a decent person!
Maximilian felt blessed with a redemptive force, a sister of the
creative forces of Nature.

You would see the world the irradiation of goodness and truth that he
was going to shed on this unhappy victim of the man since he met
and felt the sky it went into his soul, everything in it was idealistic,
noble and good deeds . What a difference between him and perdularios
in whose hands was that poor! As much as is searched in the life
of Rubin, was not found more than headaches and other physical
complaints, but to see that you draw a shameful act, not
even a foul. - Iii - One of the things Maximiliano which gave more
importance to implement its plan Redemptorist Fortunata was that you
love, because without this the sublime work would have its difficulties.
Fortunata If it is turned on, although clothes so moral, that is
the smallest possible amount of love, was not so hard that he became
attracted by the good of his soul. This need of love came after
Maximilian's insistence that his idol was asking if you wanted
something and if you would want.

Sometimes she answered yes to that facility and mechanical routine of
the children applied the lesson to be aware, sometimes, more sincere
and thoughtful, caring response that does not depend on the will of
reason, no less, and that this happens a woman who has no hair fool is
enamorisca any pelagatos, pumpkins and gives a decent people. Claimed
to be very grateful to Maximilian by being well behaved with her, and
gratitude that come with the deal, wanting. According to Rubin, the
natural order of things in the spiritual world that love is
born of gratitude, but also arises from other parents. The heart
would say, as he says things, the quiet, Fortunata who want him to
sign, and waiting with patience the fulfillment of this prophecy sweet.
However, not all had them, because as there are cases of getting
heart failure which announces the poor kid spent hours of real anguish,
and alone in his house, got into some very deep calculations to
determine the state the feelings of his beloved. Quickly moved from
the far more cruel to strict assertions. Once thought to pinch or
not wanted, as it was starting to want, and everything was to discuss
and analyze words, gestures and acts of it, interpreting them in one
way or another. 'Why I said this or that thing? What I would like to
express that resistance ... And that carcajadita, what it meant
... Yesterday when I opened the door, I said nothing ... But when
I left said to me that I cherish good. "The house was one of the
many corners of the ancient street of San Antón. The portal had a
watchmaking between crystals, leaving little room for input,
that fat had to pass half a side on the ground floor shop and a
bakery that fumes filled the home of cinnamon and sugar.

On the floor lay a major home loan farolón to the street, and some
days were in the balconies ventilation bent layers. Above the floors
were divided into narrow and low housing prices. Had right, left,
and two interior. The neighbors were of two types: single women, or
families who had their trade in the market near San Antón. Egg and
vegetable inhabited those small rooms, throwing their children
to the stairwell that played. In one of the outdoor living Feliciana
seconds and a third inside Fortunata. We rented for Rubín find so
handy, with the intention of taking home best when change of circumstances.
Maximiliano spent there the whole time that was available. At night
it was up to twelve and even one, not even missing when he was
approached by his terrible headaches. The surprise and confusion
that this caused Doña Lupe not tell what is and is not satisfied
with the explanations he gave his niece.

"This cat is locked up - said the crafty lady - or, in clearer
terms, _gata encerrada_. When Maximilian was a headache to the house
of his mistress, that he cared about as well as the Doña Lupe,
and made the impossible not to get the kids put the bulla egg. We
appreciated both the patient that he increase the love, if it were
able to increase what was already so great. Noted with satisfaction
that Fortunata hit the streets as little as possible. Morning came down
to making your purchase to the basket with his arm, and the fourth time
he returned. She was the food and cleaned the house, in whose operations
he went almost all day. Women did not receive visits from questionable
conduct, and theirs was strictly adjusted to the practices of a
regular life. "I honestly in the marrow of the bones - Maximiliano
said overflowing joy -. Like so much work that when a thing has made
the re-runs and do not be idle. The work is the foundation of virtue.
What I say, this woman was a bad force. Dulcis Amidst these
dreams of his soul away, I felt some Maximiliano saetazos that shock
him back to reality. It was as fierce a mosquito chopped when we
started sleeping sweetly ... However much money is stretched out of
the pot, in the end it was concluded that, because everything
in this world is finite, and the cash is just one of the finite things
that you can imagine ... Holy Mary! When the dreaded moment arrived ...
When the last penny out of the last hard ... changed! If the mosquito
picaba to Maximilian when he was in bed asleep or preparing to,
as incorporábase revealed that if the twelve days, or put a spin
on the bed and warm with the ardor of his feverish anxiety.

Sometimes invoked to Heaven with intimate fervor of prayer.

He hoped that the work he had undertaken generous weighs heavily in
the hidden intentions of Providence that this will draw the impasse in
which the lovers were to fall.

He was not a rascal, she was wearing well, and missed by his conduct
velos veils and more on the past.

If Providence did not take into account these circumstances, what is
worth to behave and be a model of order and good faith? This is
crystal clear. Fortunata thought so, when he hoped their fears.
Had to be, or all the talk of Providence is humbug. Coming soon to
tell how they went theirs, which showed they had up there, in the
same heaven, body weight one to protect it.

Were well-earned this protection, because it exalted by her love,
she sought honesty and tested in practice, two people who were worth
any money, or in other words, worthy of being given the means to
continue their virtuous campaign. - iv - The only visit that was
to receive Feliciana and Olmedo.

Neither one nor the other to Maximilian am very pleased: be it for
ordinary and ignoble feelings, unable to feel like as a permanent
state fair, he hit for being very, very talkative, very friendly,
dirty stories and saying obscene words.

Always go with his hat thrown back, affecting a swearword in ways
that did not have, and even imitating the manners of drunks walking,
dragging the words, but by refraining from drinking bad stomach
apology, because it really mareaba and embrutecía the second cup.

Maximiliano said in confidence to Fortunata to be moving home to avoid
neighbors as opposed to the method of decent people that had been
imposed.

From everything that I thought the love making for the redemption
of his beloved, nothing seemed so urgent as to teach write and read
well. Every morning was half an hour doing the tallies. Fortunata
wanted to learn, but neither the patience nor the sustained
attention were developing their talents calligraphy. Those were very
hard for such primordial fingers. The habit of working in her
childhood had given strength to their hands, that was beautiful, but
enough that the hands of workers. He had no pulse for writing, is the
ink-stained fingers and sweating a lot, being suffocated with the
lips and making a graceful trumpet at the time of the draw Palota.

"Nothing hociquitos, daughter of my soul, that is very ugly -- he said
patting the head teacher -. Not stuck their fingers ... If it is
something quite simple and as easy ...». It is, for him it was easy,
but she, in her life that had seen more fat, found difficulty in
writing an invincible. He said sadly that does not ever learn, and
regretted that his childhood had not put the school. Tired of reading
and also supremely bored, because after a stand while removing
medium syllables as one who draws water from a well, or was that
Jack did not understand what the text said.

Showed disrespect to the book or newspaper, saying that it was not
for the Magdalena tafetanes. If the order had no literary application,
with respect to art was not only social aplicadísima but showed
remarkable skills. The lessons gave Maximiliano things about
civility and rudimentary knowledge of which requires good education
were so profitable that it was sufficient indications sometimes likened
to a mild or a set of ideas.

"While black is the way you - you said it - I think you have
talent". In a short time taught him all the formulas that are used in
a visit met, how they greeted upon entering and leaving, how is
the house and offers many other peculiarities of the fine treatment.

And he also learned something as important as the succession of the
year, I did not know, and what is about thirty-thirty-one days.

Though it may seem a lie, this is one of the characteristics of
Spanish ignorance, more in cities than in villages, and more in
women than in men.

Like much of the housework, and do not ever tired.

His muscles were of steel, and his blood was spirited Avenio wrong
with the stillness.

As might be more caring to extend the work of shortening.

Washing and ironing is extremely pleased, and these tasks entregábase
with delight and passion, develop strength without getting tired
of their fists.

The meat was tough and tight, and robustness in combining it with
the agility, grace rudeness to compose the most beautiful wild
figure that could be imagined.

His body did not need to brace for esbeltísimo. Proud to dress dressmaker,
naked or half dressed, when I walked by that house on the balcony
tending clothes, cleaning furniture or mattresses carregando
cushions as if they were to remove the air, appeared a figure of
yore, at least, well Rubín you thought that beauty was only seen
in paintings like Amazon or something such.

Sometimes it seemed women of the Bible, Betsabeé that of the bath,
or the woman Rebeca, ladies I had seen in an illustrated book and , to
be as Barbiano still remained below two fingers of healthy beauty
and gallantry of his friend.

In the beginning of that life, Maximilian abandoned his studies much,
but when their love was metodizando, awareness of the mission that
it intended to comply with moral stimulated the study, soon to become
a man of race. And he was very particular what happened. Was noticeable
more awake, more insightful understanding, more curious about the
secrets of science, and was interested in it before it boring.

In his meditations, used to say that _le had talento_, as if saying it
had fever. Certainly it was not already there.

In a half hour lesson to be learned before it took two hours and at
the end does not know.

He grew his admiration for the kind seen in relatively easily by
replying to questions from the teacher and noted that it occurred
very judicious assessments and teacher and pupils were stunned that
_Rubinius vulgaris_ been awake for bonesetter.

At the same time found pleasure in some live readings miss the
Pharmacy, and before that will seduce little. Some of his
colleagues were bringing to the classroom, to read in secret,
literary works of the most famous.

Rubín was never fond smuggle in class between the pages of _Farmacia
chemical orgánica_ the _Werther_ of the dramas of Goethe and Shakespeare.
But after that jolt that love him, entrole such great taste for
literary creations, which embebecía reading them. _Fausto_ And devoured
the poetry of Heine, with the particularity of the French language,
which previously hindered him, he soon became easy.

Anyway, my man had spent a great crisis. The cataclysm changed the
internal configuration loving. Felt as though he had been sleeping
until the time his destination put him in front of the woman and that
the problem of redemption. "When I was a fool - said without hiding
himself the contempt with which they looked at the time that either
could be called antediluvian - when I was a fool, Eral lacking an
object in life.

Because that is stupid, people who do not have any mission. "Fortunata
had no maid.

She said, and enough left over for all the house chores so small.
Many evenings, while in the kitchen, studying their lessons Maximilian,
lying on the sofa in the room. If it were not the specter of pot is
used to appear occasionally telling the finishing of the money
taken from her, how happy would have been the poor kid! Despite this,
he seized it. Entrábale an intoxication of love that made her see all
things tinged with optimism. There were no difficulties, there was
no tripping hazards. The money would come from somewhere. Fortunata
was good, clear and well-being and their purposes of decency. Everything
was going to ask mouth, and what remained was to conclude the race y.
..
"Now I can divert
myself."

At this sally Madame du Gua turned to the other guests with a smile,
saying, "Let us spare him the dessert."

"That is a very cruel vengeance, madame," he said. "You forget my
murdered friend who is waiting for me; I never miss an appointment."

"Captain," said the marquis, throwing him his glove, "you are free;
that's your passport. The Chasseurs du Roi know that they must not
kill all the game."

"So much the better for me!" therefore I tell you now. For the
record ... I lost ... yes ... which is also, everyone must bear their
responsibility ... I lost, deceived her, I told a thousand lies, I
believe I was going to marry her. Have you seen ... If I am pillín!
Me ... I laugh a little ... Yes, all the potatoes that I told him, he
swallowed ...

The people are very innocent, is stupid auction, you think with
everything that you say is fine with words ...

The deception, he _garfiñé_ his honor, and so quiet. The men,
say, the ladies, we are miserable, we believe that the honor of the
daughters of the people is a thing of game ...

I get up, my life. I understand that you're right, I am a vile,
deserve your scorn, because ... what you say, a woman is always a
creature of God, right? ... and I, after I had fun with it, left abandoned
in the middle of the streets ... just ... their fate is the fate of
the dogs ... Say yes. "- Vi - Jacinta was alarmadísima, half dead with
fear and pain. I did not know what to do or what to say. "My son -
shouted wiping the sweat from the forehead of her husband -, how
are you ...! Calm down, Maria Santisima.'re Delirious. "- No, no,
this is not delusion, it is repentance - added Santa Cruz, who, moving,
almost falls, and had to support the hands on the floor -- . You
think maybe that wine ...? Oh! No, my daughter, I do not do this disfavor.
It is the consciousness that I have uploaded here the neck at the head,
and I weigh so much that I can not save me ... good balance to me
and prostration before you put your foot all my sins to the pardons.
.. Do not move, do not leave me alone, God ... Where you going? Do
not you see my grief - What I see ... Oh!

My God.

John, for God's sake, sosiégate not say more nonsense. Lie down.
I will make you a cup of tea. - And what I want tea, another hapless
!...

-- said in a tone so decomposed, that he jumped Jacinta tears -.

You ...!

, I want is your forgiveness, forgiveness of mankind, whom I have
offended, who have outraged and trampled. Say yes ... There are
moments in peoples lives, I mean in the lives of men, they should
have a thousand mouths for them all at once ... express la, la, la
...

It would be a chorus ...

So that ... Because I've been bad, do not tell me no, no ... tell me
what Jacinta warned that her husband sobbing.

But it was really sobbing or joke? "John Of God, you're harassing me."
- No, my soul girl - "said he sat on the floor without discovering
the face, which was in the hands -- .

Do not you see that I cry? Compadécete this unhappy ...

I've been a wicked ... Because I _Pitusa_ idolatrada ...

Let us be frank. Then He raised his head and took a more relaxed air. -
Let's be frank, the first true ...

I idolaters. I thought that I was not like the others, it was the
chivalry, the nobility, decency, nobility in person, acabose of men
... ¡Nobleness what sarcasm! Nobility in the lie, I can not be ... and
no, and no.

¡Decency because clothing is called a Levite! ... What humanity
so phoney! Always below the poor, the rich do what it chooses. I am
rich ... say that I'm fickle ... The illusion of the picturesque was
happening. Rudeness with grace seduces some time, then mark ...
Every day I weighed more burden that I had missed it.

Itching garlic repugnant to me. Like, you can believe that _Pitusa_
outside edge to give a bad ...

But, quia ... or such ... ¿Mala her? a good part ... If you command
me to go to the fire, fire!

Head! Jarana every day at home. Today, just good, not tomorrow ...
Cantos, guitarreo ... José Izquierdo, who called _Platón_ on a plate
because I ate like a shot, threw the picador Chinitas ...

Villalonga and I missed them or fight them when we should reconciliábamos
... The _Pitusa_ shivering and glad to see them sulking ... You
know what I did? Do not make one more fucking house ... Villalonga
and finally I decided to re out and no fresh wind back more. One was
armed that night gresca, even the knives came out and everyone just
swam in a lake of blood ...

I think I hear those finesse: "indecent, asshole, _najabao, RAND,
murcia_ ...! It was not such a life as possible. Say no. The boredom
was now irresistible. It was odious _Pitusa_ I like dirty words ...
One day I said _vuelvo_ and not turned over ... What Villalonga
said: cut ... I had something in my conscience, I threw a hilito
over there ... The Court ... Fortunata chased me, I had to play hide.
She here, for me there ... I escurría as an eel. I picked up, no. The
last I saw who was left one days found him climbing the stairs of my
house. He threatened me, said to me that _Pitusa_ was _cambrí_
five months of ... _ Cambria for five months ...!

_ Lift your shoulders ...

Two words, two words I ... extend the arm, and plaf ...

Izquierdo suddenly dropped a whole section ...

Another spurt and plaf ... jumped from the second ... with head
down ...

This is entirely decomposed said.

Remained seated on the floor, legs splayed, one arm supported on
the seat of the chair.

Jacinta trembled. He had deadly cold, and gave tooth to tooth. Remained
standing in the middle of the room, like a statue, contemplating
the figure of her husband lastimosísima, without daring to ask
anything or ask for clarification about the strange things that
showed.

"My God and your mother! - said at last move of love and fear - do
not tell me more.

We need you down and try to sleep. Shut up. "- Let me shut up! ... Let
me shut up!

Ah, my wife, dear wife, my angel of salvation ...

Messiah mine ... Are not forgive me ... Say yes. He got up a break
and tried to go ... I could not. Giving a fast lap was to collapse
on the sofa, put your hand over your eyes and cavernous voice saying:
'What a horrible nightmare! ". Jacinta was toward him, threw his
arms around his neck and he was lulled to coo like children when
they want to sleep.

Vencido after their excitation, the dolphin's brain fell into
brutishness stupid.

And his nerves, which had begun to subside, struggled with sedation.
Suddenly it moved, as if something jump on him and uttered a few
syllables.

But sedation expired, and so was sound asleep. At midnight with Jacinta
could not just bring work to the bed and lie down.

Fell into a dream as well, and his wife became very bad night,
haunted by unpleasant memories of what he saw and heard.

The day after Santa Cruz was as embarrassed.

I was vaguely aware of the nonsense he had done the previous night,
and his pride suffered horribly with the idea of being ridiculous.

Did not dare to speak to his wife what happened, and this one, which
was the same caution and not say a word, showed very friendly and
loving as usual. Finally, my man could not resist the urge to
explain, and preparing the ground with endless flattery, she said
'kid, we need to forgive me the hard time I gave you last night ...

I should get very lamp. .. How wrong I was!

In my past life I was like another.

Tell me the nonsense that I said because I do not remember. "- Ouch!

were many, but many ... Thanks that there was more public than I
do. - Come on, frankly ... I was unbearable. - You said ... - You
do not know ...

In my life, you can believe it, I caught a Turkish as I took it
last night.

The English had damn fault and I have to pay. Oh, how I was! ... And
what I said what I said ... Do not listen, my life, because I certainly
thousand things that are not true.

What a shame! Are you angry? No, what if there is no ... - Right. As
you were ...

Jacinta did not dare to say 'drunk'.

The word horrible negábase out of his mouth. - Say, daughter.

Di _ajumao_, which is more beautiful and somewhat mitigates the
seriousness of the offense. - Well, as _ajumaíto_ not responsible
for what you were saying. - But what, I escaped any word that might
offend you?

-- No, only half a dozen elegant voices, which uses high society.
Not well understood. Everything else was good clarita, clarita too.
We mourn your _Pitusa_ your soul, your name and miserable for
having abandoned them.

Believe it, you put that there was no where to fuck you. - Well,
daughter, now with his head cleared, I will tell you two words that
do not judge me by what I am worse.

We were strolling through the Delicias down bench and sat alone,
turned towards the river, chat a while.

Jacinta wanted to eat with your eyes to her husband, to guess the
words before they read, and to test the expression of the eyes to
see if they were sincere.

Did you talk with John right? Everything was. Their statements
were recast as a true old comedies.

Self-esteem did not allow the faithful reproduction of the incident.

Well sir ... returning from Plencia committed to love and marry his
girlfriend, wanted to know what led back Fortunata, who had not
had news in so long.

Do not move any feeling of tenderness, but the compassion and desire
to help if he was in a bad way.

_Platón_ Was out of Madrid and his wife in the other world.

No one knew where diantres had not gone to the picador, but the second
had passed and had huevería Cava in the same a little further down,
close to the ladder, a covacha to give the name of _establecimiento_.

In that cave lived and was selling coffee in the morning to people
in the market. Four pots, two chairs and a table made up the
trousseau.

In the rest of the day, serving at the tavern of _pulpitillo_. Had
been less so in the physical and economic, which cost him his old
job gathering recognize it.

"And the other ?...». because that was what mattered. - vii - Santa
Cruz took some time to give proper answer. Had scratches on the floor
with his cane. Finally be expressed as follows: "I knew that he
had indeed had ...».

Jacinta piety to avoid the last words of prayer, diciéndolas it.

Delfín to him breathe. "I tried to see it ... I looked here and there
... and nothing ... But what, do not you think? Then I could not
do anything. Occurred the death of your mom.

Spent some time unless I think such a thing, and I felt I should not
hide some escozorcillo here in consciousness ...

By January this year when I was preparing to make out, a friend told me
that the Second _Pitusa_ had left Madrid. Where? Who? Neither then,
nor I knew what I knew then. And now I swear that I have not
returned to more nor have I heard it. "The wife took a big sigh.
I did not know why, but I had some regret about his soul, and his
righteousness for himself took some responsibility for her husband's
absence at that, because there was no doubt needed.

Jacinta could not otherwise consider the fact of abandonment, even if
this meant the triumph of love over the legitimate criminal, and
marriage on a de ...

They could not entertain more idle gossip, because they thought
going to Cadiz that afternoon and needed to have my luggage and buy
some sweets. Of each stock had to bring gifts for all Madrid. The task
for a day of travel, shopping, and some redundancies were distracted
as well both of those unpleasant thoughts, which in the afternoon and
they had vanished. Until three days later did not return Rebull
Jacinta in the minds of the that bug.

Thing was sudden, caused by what I do not know, for these initiatives
of the mysterious report that we do not know where to post.

Remembers one of the things against all logic, and sometimes the chain
is one of the ideas and even a ridiculous extravagance.

Who would believe that Jacinta was agreed to hear preaching from the
Fortunata _bocas of Isla_? Why tell the curious, and quite rightly,
that what they have to do with that woman mouths. Nothing, absolutely
nothing. Husbands returning from Cadiz in the mail train.

             Do not stop and think anywhere, and come to Madrid for a hitch.

Iban very joyful, eager to see the family, and give each one his gift.
Jacinta, but chopped the bug that had resolved never to speak of the
matter, leaving it buried in the memory until the time is erased forever.
But upon arriving at the station Jerez, something happened that
was unexpectedly revived forget what they both wanted. Well sir ...
the canteen at the station exit were convicted of the English night
in question, which they knew to the point and went to greet a very fine
and gallant, and given some reeds. When they were free of him, threw
him Santa Cruz thousand pests, and said that one day had to have the
opportunity to give _par of galletas_ they had won. "This dance
was to blame me that I made that night and as I tell you that those
horrors ...». Here the conversation began to engage again in the fall
_punto negro_.

Jacinta did not want to be left in the soul an idea I had, and
the first time threw out of his mind. "Poor women! - exclaimed -.
Always the worst part for them. "- My daughter, you have to judge
things carefully considering the circumstances ... see the environment
... - Santa Cruz preparing said all of that dialectic chirimbolos
conventional test which is all you want. caricias Jacinta was left
to do.

I was not angry. But his spirit did a very new phenomenon for her. Two
different feelings are shuffled in his soul, overlay each other
alternately. As adored her husband, proud that this would have
neglected to take one for her. This pride is paramount, and always
will exist even in the most perfect beings. The other came from the
depth of feeling that weighed righteousness that noble soul and
inspired a protest against the outrage and ruthless abandonment of the
unknown. For more than mitigated the Dolphin, was outraged to humanity.
Jacinta could not hide itself. The triumphs of his self did not make
him see that beneath the trophy of his victory had been a victim
crushed. Maybe the victim deserved to be, but the winner had
nothing to do with who deserve it or not, and at the altar of his soul
as he placed the victim in a compassionate light. Santa Cruz, in his
insight, understood, and tried to free his wife from the hassle of
pleasing no doubt who deserved it. To put this in office all machinery
brighter sound that your rationale, learned the trade in human liviandades
and shallow readings. 'Daughter of my soul, it is necessary to
reality. There are two worlds, and that is you can not see.

The company is not ruling with pure ideas.

Buenos walk ... I'm not as guilty as it seems at first sight, look
good.

Differences in education and class always sets a great difference
in procedures in human relationships.

This does not say the Decalogue, says the reality.

Social behavior has its laws that are written anywhere, but they
feel and can not be violated.

Fouls committed, who can doubt?

, But imagine that among those people had followed that _hubiera
met my compromisos_ with _Pitusa_ ... I do not want to say more. I see
you laughing. That proves that I was an absurd, crazy tour, which
saw over there, it seemed the right way. Seen here is a different one.
In things moral, straight and crooked are according to where you look.
There was therefore little choice but to do what I did, and save ...
Caiga the fall. The world is so. I had to save me, yes or no? Therefore
be saved, there was no choice but to throw off the boat that sank.

In the wreck there's always someone who is drowning ... And in the
case of abandonment, there is also plenty to talk about.

Certain words do not mean anything by it. Must see the facts ...
I looked for help, she refused to appear. Everyone has their destiny.
On it was this: do not mind when I was looking for. "Nobody would say
that the man who thus reasoned with art so subtle and paradoxical,
was the same as night before, under the influence of spirits, had
emptied the entire his soul with such brutal honesty and shot that
can only be compared to physical vomiting produced by a strong
emetic.

And then, when the clearance of his brain made him master of all tricks
read and worldly man, not again leave his lips not a single foul word,
not one of those spontaneity that existed within it, as there are
colorful rags in a corner of the house that was funny, though it has
only been a hobby. Everything was conventionalism and witty phrase
in that man who was intellectually oneself up, cut a Levite for
ideas and ironing necks language.

Jacinta that still had little world, it was left by the rock seductive
qualities of her husband. And I wanted so much, perhaps because of
those same qualities and others that did not need any effort to
believe As I said, while believed by faith, which is feeling rather
than conviction.

Long time talk, mixing discussions with cariños discrete (because
people came in Seville in the car and did not consider the
_besadera_), and when night came on Spain, whose radio iban walking,
fell asleep around Despeñaperros, dreamed how much they are wanted,
and at last awakened to the idea in Alcázar pleasant coming soon
to Madrid to see the family for all the ups of the trip (less the
scene that night) and allocate gifts.

Estupinan A bore him a stick that was the fist of a parrot
head.

VI-More and more details regarding this illustrious family - i -
spent months, years passed, and in that blessed house and all was
peace harmony.

There has been no known family in Madrid that the best avenue of
Santa Cruz, made up of two couples, nor is it possible to imagine
a character like the compatibility between Barbarita and Jacinta.

I have seen many times together in the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law,
and that God was very little difference in these ages.

Barbarita kept at fifty three years and a wonderful freshness, the perfect
size and teeth surprising.

True that the hair was almost entirely white, which seemed more
powdered under Pompadour style, that gray with age. But what made her
the youngest was his constant kindness, that graceful and benevolent
smile that lit up his face. I really did not need to complain about
their fate those four people.

             There are cases of individuals and families to whom God does not
owe anything, and yet, ask and ask.

It is in human nature a habit of begging, and this has no
doubt. Such as Santa Cruz, who enjoyed full health, were rich
ladies around the world and wanted endearing. What they needed? It seems
that nothing. Well, one of four pordioseaba. Is that when a set of
favorable circumstances placed in the hands of man large amounts of
goods, depriving it of one, the fate of our nature or the principle
of discontent that exists in our mud establishing you want to drive
what little that is not has given. Health, love, wealth, peace and
other benefits did not meet the soul of Jacinta and married a year,
even after two years, wished fervently that it was. Poor young man!
It had everything but kids. This penalty, which at first was negligible
discomfort, impatience convirtiose soon just painful idea of emptiness.
Christian was little, in the words of Barbarita, despair at the lack
of succession. God, that would give them so many assets that habíales
private. There was no choice but to resign, praising the hand of the
same sample giving that away its omnipotence. Thus consoled his
daughter-daughter she seemed, but back in herself as much as Jacinta
wanted the appearance of a boy who perpetuate them chaste and cheer
to all.

It was quieter this burning desire not to increase the penalty from the
other, but looked forward to anything that could be signs of hope for
succession. But quia! He spent one year, two, and nothing, not even
these vague presumptions that make the heart throb of that dream
of motherhood, and sometimes they do say and do many foolish things.
"Do not hurry, daughter - said their Barbarita niece -.

You are very young.

Do not rush the kids, which will have you family responsibilities, and
you are bored bored as your mother, and ask God to give you no more.
You know what? We are better that way.

The boys and do not stir any more than dislikes. Measles, croup ... So
you want to say nothing of love! ... What a calamity! ... Then
you made a slave ... That if they eat as if it indigestible, that if
they fall and open up the head.

Then they take inclinations. If you go on a bad character ... if not
studying ... what do I know !...».

Jacinta is not persuaded. Canaries wanted bedroom, full trance, while
leaving stunted and ugly, although they were naughty, sick and
skulls, but the men killed dislikes.

Her two older sisters pariah every year as his mother. And it all,
or hope.

For further contradiction, Candelaria, who was married to a poor, two
had a belly. And she, who was rich, was not even half! ... And God
was certainly chocho.

We now turn to something else. The Santa Cruz, as rich and respectable
family, were very well connected and had friends in all areas,
from highest to lowest.

The awful images of the
catastrophe filled her imagination suddenly, and the graceful creature
who held modesty to be the first of women's wiles forgot herself in a
moment of madness, and marched towards the amazed commandant
brusquely.

"In exchange for a few murdered soldiers," she said, "I will bring to
the block a head that is worth a million heads of other men. It is not
a woman's business to wage war; but you, old as you are, shall learn
good stratagems from me. I'll deliver a whole family to your bayonets
--him, his ancestors, his past, his future. I will be as false and
treacherous to him as I was good and true. Yes, commandant, I will
bring that little noble to my arms, and he shall leave them to go to
death. I have no other rival. The wretch himself pronounced his doom,
--/a day without a morrow/. Your Republic and I shall be avenged. The
Republic!" she cried in a voice the strange intonations of which
horrified Hulot. "Is he to die for bearing arms against the nation?
Shall I suffer France to rob me of my vengeance? Ah! what a little
thing is life! death can expiate but one crime. He has but one head to
fall, but I will make him know in one night that he loses more than
life. Commandant, you who will kill him," and she sighed, "see that
nothing betrays my betrayal; he must die convinced of my fidelity. I
ask that of you. Let him know only me--me, and my caresses!"

She stopped; but through the crimson of her cheeks Hulot and Corentin
saw that rage and delirium had not entirely smothered all sense of
shame. "We remain," said those and gently pushed him down on his camp.
"I am committed to you on the bed, and we chat for half an hour,
because it is at all nine bell clock, and in Ulm, nobody sleeps when
this bubble-head, one to cool tonight has bedded quite hard."

He took George's hand and sat down at his feet on the bed.

"Oh, how can I earn mild indulgence!"

George said, "I am not in your eyes as an ungrateful because of
your kindness zurückstößt, your kind and what for him with a rough
hand ausgesonnen tears?"

"No, my young friend!" the friendly man replied, "You are standing in
front of my eyes as the true son of your father. Just as quickly ready
with praise and blame, with determination and he was speaking. The fact
that he is a man of honor was, I know perfectly well, but I also know
how unfortunate it's flare up quickly, his defiance, the strength
he notes, did. "" But tell yourself, noble Lord!

" said George. "Could I act differently today? Had I not Truchseß
brought to the extreme?" "You might act differently if you have the way
and kind attention of this man who you already kundgab lately.

Also you would have thought that enough people because were that you
could not be wronged. You, however, test pour out the baby with the
bathwater, and ran away. "" The colder it is age, "replied the
young man," but at the youth have hot blood.

I can endure anything , hardness and rigor if they are fair and not
offend my honor. But cold ridicule, scorn on the misfortune of my
house I can to make rabid wolf.

How can such a large man just enjoy it, so to torture?

" In this way, always expresses his anger, "taught him Frondsberg."

The colder and sharper but he is from the outside, the hotter the cooking
in his anger. He was, at the thought came to you to Tübingen to send
some because otherwise he knew not, and partly also to the
injustice that he pleased with you, done.

In a sense this show was very honorable. but you have him hurt by your
refusal before the war and ashamed. "" How? " cried George. "The
proposed Truchseß me? Sun did not show those of you?" "No," gave him
the box with a mysterious smile captain replied, "no. I told him even
with all the trouble discouraged, to send you, but it helped nothing,
because the real reasons I could not tell him. I knew before you
arrived, that you would refuse, to accept this office .-- Well, but
tear your eyes is not so, when you wanted me through the leather
Koller inside look into the heart.

I know all sorts of stories of my young Trotzkopf here! "George suggested
the bewildered eyes down. "So you were not enough reasons that I
stated?" he said. "What do you want to mystery of me know?" "Mysterious?
Well, even so secretive, it is not, because remember for the future:
If you do not want to be betrayed, we must not be dancing in the
evening as a sign of from the St. Vitus' dance is infected, still
afternoon at three o clock beautiful girls go. Yes, my son, I know all
sorts, "he added, he smiled with his finger threatened," I know that
this impetuous heart Württemberg is good. "Georg blushed and managed
the lurking eye of the knight is not bearable. "Württembergische?"
he said, after he had taken with great difficulty. "Since your doing
me wrong, not with you on the field to attempt to draw does not mean
that the enemy adapter; certainly, I swear to you -" "Swear not!"
Frondsberg it fell rapidly into the word. "An oath is an easy word,
but it is certainly an oppressively heavy chain that can break down,
or you will be shattered.

             What you are going to do, it will be so that it can tolerate with
your honor.

Only one thing you have to the federal government to declare Instead
vow, and only then will you from your prison: in the next fourteen
days to fight against us. "" To me, your so wrong attitudes still
under?

" said George moved. "That I would not have thought it? And how unnecessary
this oath: For whom and with whom should I have to fight for that
page?

The Swiss are deducted, the peasantry has been allayed, the knighthood
is in the forts and is wary of the next best of Bundesheer
herüberläuft, incorporated into its walls, the duke himself has
escaped - "" Fugitive?

" Frondsberg cried out. "Fugitive? The white man is not yet so sure,
why would the Truchseß because the riders ausgeschickt?" he added.
"And anyway, where were you all these messages come from? Did you
overhears the War? Or should it be true what some want to say that you
suspect has links with Wuerttemberg?" "Who dares to say this?" cried
George testator. Frondsbergs penetrating scrutinizing eyes rested on
the trains of the young man. "Listen, you're too young and too honest
to a piece of boys," he said, "and if you type something in the lead
shield, you probably did not losgesagt by the federal government, but
also made Württembergs spy." "How? When talking to me? " George
interrupted him, "If your only a spark of love to me, you called
me as the bad guy, it speaks of me!"

                                "Do not be so tempered again!"

                       Frondsberg said and pressed the hand of the young man.

"You can think that if such a word spoken in public or I would at this
Einflüsterungen believed Georg von Frondsberg not come to you. But
because it must be something in the thing. For the old Lichtenstein was
often a simple peasant in the city, he was not on at a time when
so many people are here.

But you gave us Winke secret that this farmer a devious man and a secret
ambassador from Württemberg was. The Lichtenstein drew from, and
the farmer and his mysterious goings was forgotten. This morning
he showed up again. He is in front of the city with a long time
you have spoken, but he was seen in your house. How does this thing
now? "George had given him listened with growing amazement. "So it
is a God above me," he said, as Frondsberg had ended, "I am innocent.
This morning a farmer came to me and -" "Now why you suddenly fall
silent," Frondsberg asked, "You glow yes over and over, what is it with
this messenger? "" Oh, I am ashamed it out and still you have already
guessed everything he taught me a few words - my Liebchen! " The young
man opened with these words his jerkin and pulled out a strip of
parchment, which he had hidden there. "Look, this is everything he
has," he said, he offered it Frondsberg. "So that is all?" laughed
this after he had read.

"Poor boy! And you know this man that is not? You do not know who he
is?" "No, he is nothing more than our Liebesbote, but I wanted to
stand!" "A beautiful Liebesbote, our side of things is to scout, because
you know not that the most dangerous man, it's the Pfeifer Hardt.
"" The Pfeifer Hardt? " asked George. "For the first time I hear this
name, and what if he Pfeifer Hardt is?" "That no one quite knows
who was the uprising of the poor Konrad is one of the most
terrifying rebel, he was later pardoned, and since that time, he
an unsettled life and is now a scout of the Duke of Wurttemberg. ""
And you have caught him? " Georg researched further because he was
involuntarily warmer portion of his new servant. "No, this is just
incomprehensible, it made us so quietly as possible, the
advertisement that he is back in Ulm can see in your barn, it was
last , and as we dig him very secretly wished he was on all
the mountains. Well, I believe your word and your honest eyes,
that he in no other matters to you came - You can rely on, moreover,
that, if it is the same, I mean, not only because of you that
ventured to Ulm. And you should ever again meet with him, so you take
in eight, such a rabble is not to be trusted.

But the Guardian urges ten clock. Put yourself up again Your ear
and verträume captivity. Previously but give me your word because of
the fourteen days, and I say this to you when you leave Ulm, without
the old Frondsberg say farewell to -. "" I come, I come, "cried
George, touched by the poignancy of the honorable man, which of
those in vain under a smiling face to hide examined. He gave his
hand fidelity, as the war demanded, but left the Knights with slow
steps the dead chamber. Chapter 12, the midday sun the following
day sent oppressive rays on a tab, which on the part of the
Swabian Alb, against the Swiss franc amounts, you buy a new. He was
young, slim as a more firmly built, and rode a tall horse, a
dark brown color, he was probably armed with chest armor, sword and
dagger, and some other pieces of its armature, when the helmet and
the iron plate driven arm and leg splints, were fastened on the
saddle.

The light blue and white striped box binders, the right shoulder over
the chest moved, had guessed that the young man of nobility were,
because this award was a privilege of higher levels. He was on a
mountain summit, which is a wide view down into the valley granted.
Fri considered to be snorting horse, it turned to the side and now
enjoyed the beautiful sight, which is spread before his eyes. Before
him a vast plain of wooded heights limited, through the green waves
of the Danube, on his right, the ridge of Württemberg Alb, to
continue in his left, the distant snow peaks of the Tyrolean Alps.
In a friendly blue sky stretched his bow on the scene, and his soft
bright colors contrasted oddly with the blackish walls of Ulm, at
the foot of the mountain was, with its dark gray massive cathedral
tower.

The muffled bells of the old church began at that moment the einzuläuten
lunch, their tones were in long, soothing chords of the city, on the
vast plain, until they are at the distant mountains and broke in the
trembling blue skies verschwebten as if at their melodic heads the
wishes of the people to heaven. "So then accompanied her to the
outgoing as you have welcomed his entrance," cried the young rider,
"with the same tones, with the same solemn chords you speak to him if
he comes and goes, how different, how so very different, I suggested
your brass voices, as my ear for the first time you listened. As
I heard in you related sounds, it sounded to me like a cry for love And
now that I distinguish, without the prospect, without joy, now
it calls me the same tones opposite? The birth of my blessed hope you
have begun, one of you sounds bell now the grave of my hope? The
picture of life!

" He wistfully added, by a long farewell look at this valley,
these walls turned his horse. "The image of life! To cradle and
coffin floats in the same tones, and the bell of my chapel to have that
happy day when you took me to the christening, so I just tinted, as
they will drown me if the storm last spring contributes to the
grave! "The mountain was steep now, and George, because as these,
our readers, the young riders have long recognized George had his horse
riding slowly Hinsch by his thoughts nachhing. It was the way to his
home, and the comparisons between it and the return of this happy
statement in place, might not contribute to his gloomy feelings
aufzuhellen.

Yesterday's day, the fast exchange of intense emotions, his
arrest, still the last farewell to men who wohlwollten him, had
violently attacked him. What was good-natured honesty and Dietrich
Kraft, his graceful hospitality, regretted his departure. How
similar was that this good man in his kindness to him has remained,
from the first cup in which he with him in City Hall room emptied,
until Strunk farewell to his host, he still serving up the
horse. And how was he rewarded? Busy with himself, he had little
respect for him, overlooked. As he had the bourgeois Breitenstein,
as the hero Frondsberg of him before the eyes of an army as his
favorite was impeccable, as he had paid him? He had this idea of a good
muddy trail on the mountain back then. The rays of the March sun was
always pressing of the rough paths, and he decided, under the shade
of an oak tree and rest his horse at lunchtime treat. He dismounted,
strapped to the girth easily fatigued and had the animal the grasses
sparingly hervorkeimenden attention. He stretched himself down under
the oak, and so he was happy to sleep would be, what after the tiring
ride him invited to the cool shade, so held him but the concern in
such troubled times in a country so close to the scene of the
War was to his horse and maybe even to come to his arms; awake for
some time, until he sank into that state where the soul between
waking and sleeping for nothing with the body fights the impetuous
calls his rights.

He wants to be a hour slumbered have him as the neighing of his horse
aufschreckte. He looked around and saw a man who, his back kehrend
with the animal employed. His first thought was that you use his
carelessness and the horse wanted to kidnap. He jumped up, drew his
sword and fell in three jumps there. "Halt! What have you given the
horse to create!" cried he, by his hand a little rough on the shoulder
of the man presented. "Have you me again because of your service
laid off, Junker?" replied the latter and turned to him. On the cunning,
daring eyes, the smiling mouth Georg immediately recognized the
messenger that he had sent Marie. He was still undecided how he
should behave against him, because Frondsbergs warning startled
him, Mary confidently recommended him, but the farmer went on, by
providing it with a good handful of hay to show: "I could probably
think, that you do not feed bag will take.

On the mountain top because it looks bad even with the grass, because
I have your brown hay brought an armful. It has excellent comfortable
with him. "Thus spoke the farmer and went completely down continues,
the horse of the feed added," And where are you now? "Asked George,
when he was a little recovered from his astonishment had." Well, you
are so quickly from Ulm weggeritten that I did not follow the same
could, "replied." lie not, "interrupted him, the young man" Otherwise,
I can not trust you fürder. You come now not from that city. "" Well,
you will not scold me but that I was a little earlier on the road as
you did? "Said the farmer, and turned away. But George did not
mean that those crafty smile again drew on his face. "Let my
horse now," said George impatiently, "and come with me under the oak
tree there. As you sit back and say, but without evading, why did
you so suddenly last night the city? "" At the Ulmern it was not,
"replied the." They wanted to invite me even longer for them to stay,
and wanted me free food and housing type. "" Yes, into the deepest
dungeon, they wanted to put you, where neither sun nor moon hinscheint
and where the scouts and scouts are. "" With all due respect, Junker,
"replied the messenger," because I would be, though a few floors
below, came in the same dwelling as you.

"Hund by a minder," cried the impatient Junker by anger rötete
his cheeks. "Do you want my father's son in a series represent
the Pfeifer Hardt?" "What you say there?" drove the man at his side
to face with wild. "What you call for a name? Do you know the
piper Hardt? "He had perhaps involuntarily from these words, the
ax, which stood beside him, his rights taken annoying. Its compact
solid figure, his broad chest, gave him, despite his size is not
impressive, but the reputation to despise a non-fighter. His wildly
rolling eyes, his mouth eingepreßter want some single man except version
have. The young man jumped, but bravely on, he threw back his long
hair, and a glance full of pride and sovereignty met the dark eyes
of that man . He put his hand on the handle of his sword, and said
quietly and firmly: "What do you like that so before you add me and
with this face to ask me? You are, if I am not mistaken, the one
I mentioned, you are this leader of the mutineers and seditious dogs.
Pack you continue on the site, or I will show you how to speak with
such rabble. "The farmer and his anger seemed to wrestle. He cut off
the ax with a strong swing in the tree, and was now without a weapon
before zürnenden young man "Permits," he said, "I did that for
another time warning, your opponent, and he was also only a small
farmer like me man, not between you and your brown as well. Because
if I am your command, fortzupacken me, would want to follow up
fast, he would come to me zustatten excellent.

"A look so convincing George that the farmer had spoken true.

The wind was blowing
across the heights and sweeping away the clouds with violence,
producing an alternation of shadows and light, the effect of which
increased her fears, and gave fantastic and terrifying semblances to
the most harmless objects. She turned her eyes to the houses of
Fougeres, where the domestic lights were burning like so many earthly
stars, and she presently saw distinctly the tower of Papegaut. I jumped
in and out and took it all in motion, it was apparent that Marie
Born was attacked. Soon after our guns fired from the battery before
Chaussee house, it was therefore a valid herandringenden enemies.
The regiment of the Duke, from which a squadron Chaussee house behind
the store was out flick, the moment was hardly explainable. The small
gun fire in Marie Born, in the back of our batteries, took away,
and our batteries also shot. I sat on a horse and rode next to
where I am, after earlier taken note of whether it was the same
night, the area was assessed. I expected every moment, Marie Born in
flames to be seen, and rode back to our tents, where I was the
Duke of people employed was a aufzupacken and, in any case. I advised
them my suitcase and portfolio, and discussed our retreat. They wanted
to at Oppenheim; there I could easily follow, since to me the path
through the field was known fruit, but do I wait until the success
and I tend not to remove until the village is burning and the
controversy behind the same next heraufzöge. In such uncertainty, I
saw the thing, but soon went to the little rifle fire, the guns fell
silent, the day began to gray, and the village was very quiet in
front of me. I rode down. The Sun went on to note turbid, and the
victims of the night lay next to each other.

Our gigantic, wohlgekleideten Kürassiere made a whimsical contrast
with the dwarf-like, par cut, without ragged trousers, and the death
rate was no difference hingemäht. Our good Captain La fours was
among the first remains of Captain Voss, adjutant of Count Kalckreuth,
shot through the chest that one expected his death. I was even a
brief relation of this wonderful and unpleasant incident up what I
turn here and then add a few particularities. * * * * * From the
failure of the French in the night, Marie Born I reported the following:
The Marie Born headquarters is located in the middle of the semicircle
of bearings and batteries, on the left bank of the Rhine above Mainz
begin, the city is not even at the distance of half an hour
surrounded and under the same again to connect the river.

The chapel at Holy Cross, the villages Weissenau, Hechtsheim Marie
Born, Drais, Gunzenheim, Mombach parties will be informed of this
either affect or are not far off.

The two wings of Weissenau and Mombach were from the beginning of
the blockade at the French often attacked and burned the former
village, the center remained without contestation.

Nobody could suspect that they then would set up a failure because
they were in danger from all sides in the crowd were going to be
cut off without telling them something important.

Meanwhile, the outpost to Bretzenheim and Dalheim, places, before
Marie Born in an underlying that is after the city moves, always
together, and you claimed Bretzenheim so keen on this, as the French
number for Bach, a monastery near Dalheim, had set up a battery and
thus the field and the Chaussee coated.

An intention that you not trust the enemy, persuaded him finally to
a loss against the headquarters.

The French wanted to - so you are convinced by the prisoners - the
General Kalckreuth, in Marie Born, Prince Louis Ferdinand's son, on
the road home, a few hundred steps from the village in the district
was caught either dead or continue to leave behind.

They chose the night of 30 at 31, retired, perhaps 3000 men, from
the number Bacher based on the winding road and through some of the
reasons to return to the road, they passed again and hurried off
to Marie Born.

They were well run and took her way between Oestreicher and Prussian
patrols which, unfortunately, due to small change of ups and
downs, not attracted to each other. Neither did they have something
to Hülfe.

One day previously had beordert farmers and grain, against the city
is, on this night abzumähen; as a perfect after work went back, they
followed the French, and several patrols were made by mistaken .

Seeing him so
depressed, disheartened, and pale, she believed herself to be the
cause of his sadness. Her anger changed to pity, her pity to
tenderness, and she suddenly knew that it was not revenge alone which
had brought her there.

The marquis rose, turned his head, and stood amazed when he saw, as if
in a cloud, Mademoiselle de Verneuil's face; then he shook his head
with a gesture of impatience and contempt, exclaiming: "Must I forever
see the face of that devil, even when awake?"

This utter contempt for her forced a half-maddened laugh from the
unhappy girl which made the young leader quiver. He sprang to the
window, but Mademoiselle de Verneuil was gone. And many believe that
the worst head of this house is the poor Maxi, when mine is an aviary.
Two words of truth that I know who I would make the person happier and
more rope to earth ... Seeing this Rubín entering, took another twist
to his talk. "Here I was telling half his face, which I shall give
you some pills ... God, what pills!." - For her - no man, for you .--
And what are they?

- Good going, and want to know what they are. Carambita when one
runs something new, secrecy must be reserved. It is a specific.
- This is Segismundo ido - said Fortunata -. Come on. - I do not
take pills without knowing the composition - as indicated Maxi
good faith. - These men are very happy impertinent. All I want to find
out ... And now goes on with his Dove paseíto! What a slimy _semos_
...! Then complains about the baby! ... (tirándole an ear), complains
about service ... the spoiled child of Providence ... Abura fun. Came
to say goodbye to the door of the shop, was very stiff, and
stretching every effort on their shoes, I continued the hearing
until it disappeared at the top of the street. - Vi - - They were tired
from the days of summer, which is the Madrid station sorrows, because
sleep and appetite are scarce, society is declining, and those who
remain here seem to eat the bread of emigration. At the Rubin family
did nothing particularly because Maxi no worse, but every morning
the excitement was for more or fewer, but until reaching a level of
fury like the famous mañanita arsenic, the two women could take it
with patience. At night, the depressions were visible slightly, and
sometimes did not know. Ballester had, combining persuasion with severity,
to depart at all from reading all favorable to the concentration of
mind. Among Fortunata and Doña Lupe was not all harmony, as can be
understood as the lady Jáuregui, astute observer, he had understood
that since early June her niece walked in bad steps. All persons
connected with the family of Rubín knew the history of women Maxi,
and the dramatic role in it, the gentleman from Santa Cruz. Some,
perhaps, knew of that third out of the field of adventurous crazy
dream, but no one dared to bring the story of _The Pavos_.

This, however, knew by the work of pure calculation and their olfactory
abilities. Arrancose once _armar the gorda_ "that does not - I thought
- I drink your lies and I'm here doing the flycatchers. But Fortunata,
instantly recalling the lessons of his friend Feijoo drew the line
dividing this to recommend, and came to essentially say: 'here
and there, ma'am, you govern, from here to here, and are _mis cosas_
you do not get it. "did not give up the proud widow of Alabardero,
and re-loading two or three times in this way:" If the poor Maxi was
good, he will arrange to meet as a man who estimated, but it is
not, and I have to take me to my office decorum of the family. I've
said a thousand times: 'I will not give the outbreak or the
outbreak?'. In the situation of that poor, I would blast his death.
So me and I drink all contain the poison. See, my head is filling
with white hair since I am not able to remedy this outrage ...».
Fortunata became the face to hide her tears. This scene happened in
the cabinet, while the two summer sewing costumes. "After what
happened in November last year - continued the widow, calmly
horrified that - after your amendment true or false, then that I
forgive you (and my vote will not be forgiven), then the land that
we feel horrible crime, I think you were forced to behave differently.
Do not come now lagrimitas seems to be hypocrisy. Because I say a
thing.

Listen to me carefully. "Doña Lupe stopped sewing and was prepared
to speak, as the speakers work. "I put in the case of a woman who
feels a passion ancient raigones with very deep and you can not
boot. There are cases, indeed, this is to look down. Well if you'd come
to me and I'd say: 'Auntie, I am going. I seek, I do not know if I can
defend myself, I am weak; me you ...'.

Oh, things changed a lot. Because I would have addressed you, I would
have given strength, comfort ...

But no, you crave field by your respects, and do happen and as a mozuela
without trial ...

This is nonsense: there you go, here is the reason for your
misfortune in the absence of anything to those who must guide. Total,
that aid workers and asking when they will be too late, and they will
tell you: 'Entiéndete now húndete and Cover your shame and date of
the demons'. Filipa delivered this eloquent, continued the lady a
good time giving space puff and Fortunata not look up from their sewing.
Went on the strangeness of those concepts of the widow, who seemed
ready to certain temperaments lenient where the consultation, and
that she had the unerring dispenser of protection and sanction of
the shares. "This woman wants to be the Pope - he thought -
and as long as the Pope made, agrees to everything. But what is for
me ...». A Fortunata is repugnant morality despotic Doña Lupe,
in which more Entrevías arrogance that righteousness, or righteousness
adapted Jesuit arrogance. Not satisfied with this absolute ideas
of the young criminal. She wanted absolution for their acts or
complete the full condemnation.

Hell or Heaven, and nothing else. _su Idea_ and had no need for advice
or protection from anyone. They comprised only much better, and
regardless of his cross, he did not need Cirineo.

Their actions were decisive, straight went to them as projectile
fired out of the canyon.

Having Doña Lupe, for those who secreteos Casta was with her friend,
that Santa Cruz had left to spend the summer, took the foot of
this to foist another speech to his niece, but in tone catilinario
less than the previous ones. It was essentially the government and
those ladies always built on the solid basis of facts all their
plans and reasoning.

"Look where you might come to understand - we said one afternoon that
was again on hand to take the case -.

I know that the person who brings you dislocated it is not already in
Madrid. What better time to want to undertake the reform of your inner
state, which is like a house in ruins? I am willing to help any way
we can. Should not do, but I love and I am responsible for human
weaknesses.

Another take on the street in the middle, I think that things must
be very sensitive with a ten to ten. I would start in background,
by entrusting to the smallest details, understand well, even the
smallest details, for I know what you think, what you feel, from the
temptations that give you morning, afternoon At night, in order, had
to declare all Todito symptoms that fucking disease, I call on you
to do everything I missiles.

So, as if the widow had in his pocket recipes for all cases of heart
disease.

To meet, rather than taste, Fortunata was condescending to say
something, reserving, of course the most sensitive. Doña Lupe is so
enthusiastic with that show of submission, which demonstrated their
professional abilities, and ended thus: "I assure you that if I
obey, you remove it from the head and be what you're not a model
of married women.

For suddenly, I promise not to fall again, even if you tended to be the
tie again. Go with alicia! Thing is to inform the police.

Let you take, put the lawsuit on my hands, let me ... and see. ¿Gambling
planto to me one day at home and singing Barbara clarita?

You do not know who I am, you do not know me. And you are so stupid
that you have not wanted valerte me ...! Well deserved what you got
going on. Well it is now, not like that, I work on this ... You conclude
by worship as a mother loves. "And when doña Lupe was radiant.
Almost almost ventured to make her niece a motherly affection,
such was his joy and satisfaction.

A thought he was leaving the Magín at every instant, but it
reserved the hidden leaf brown grammar. Neither the shadow of this
thought gave a glimpse Fortunata.

Guardábalo and recreate it for him alone. "Would you be given
money?". Whenever there was this question is answered affirmatively.
"It must have given him something, perhaps large quantities. But
where the hell are you? What makes it the give me the place to be
...

As if seeing is ashamed of having put my hands on money gained through
such means. This delicacy and honor ... And there is another thing
you ashamed to tell me. But in the end it will come. "And then the
marriage had gone to ride the great capitalist, no longer able to
face their curiosity, Daddy sent a message by staying single, and
with admirable determination made in a register comfortable and the
trunk of Fortunata.

Without using the keys so I had opened all the drawers and turned them
carefully, careful to leave things well after consideration, the
same provision that previously had. This approach Jesuitical
practiced what it always got her hands where they should not be scrutinized
to be. Look around there, look over there, and nothing. Tickets can be
hidden so easily, there is no way to find them. But he was so thin
doña Lupe smell to find money to make sure whether the tickets were.
'Tendral sewn into clothes - thought -.

Maybe. That sardonic seems you do not know Jack, and I know more ...!».
In the comfortable there was nothing that appeared to be money,
or letters.

Some jewelry and trinkets saw, it seemed to remember or pledge of love,
but what is _guano_, nor smell. "It is very special - gruñía widow,
with the trunk, after the recognition that the depth was comfortable
-- .

And no one understands that he is so rich and her poor ...!».

The trunk, which contained only old clothes, did not nothing to it.
"It has to be something ...-- Mrs grumble - there must be something.

Somewhere there is the cache. There is money or no money in the world.
"Tired of your useless vote and keeping the keys, forming a tight
cluster, worthy of a company's arsenal of thieves Doña Lupe sat
down to meditate, and put a hand on your chest Cotton and caressed,
scratched on the fingers of the other front, where the hair begins,
as one who encourages the generation of an idea, and said: 'Well
if they actually have not given anything, we must recognize that
this man is the largest of the indecent. "- vii - Tighten the heat,
and the scenes I have described is repeated, playing with mannerisms
that often take human life in certain periods, which fatigued artist
neglected the renewal of the .

Paseítos the night to take the tram from _barrio_; trips to some
summer theater, the gatherings at home or Rubín Samaniego; garatusas
the critic in the street, the romantic figure of Olimpia perched
on the balcony as a sample or insignia that read: "here love so
fine" extravagances of Ballester, Maxi spasms, continued to be
repeated throughout each day of regular program.

In August something happened that was not in the papers, and was as
follows. Torquemada was a morning to see Doña Lupe to discuss business.
With its summer dress, was good D. Francisco look like the military
coming from Cuba, since most of trajecito blue encasquetado was
a straw hat wide brimmed.

His shirt, striped colored seemed the United States flag, and to
emphasize its American look, wearing a jewel in a tie and watch
endless chain, which gave many turns to another part of the chest.

The pants were so short that when he was seen sitting half leg. There
was okay to say that the _difunto was chico_. All these garments seem
inherited or came into its possession by judicial, or caught any
filibuster. Servíale the hat of a fan when I was visiting, with the
advantage that the surrounding people involved in the ventilation
tropical garment that was handled so well.

A while wearing interesting conference, when the bell rang, and just
came in the Maxi cabinet, which is where Don Francisco and his
aunt were.

Fortunata was ironing.

As seen arriving at her husband went to see what was being offered because
there must be something unusual. To this hour, the ten o'clock, do not
ever come home the poor kid. Echándose a handkerchief by the shoulders,
because the heat of the iron required it to be cool, went to the
cabinet.

The same thing she was astounded that her aunt to see the face in
a couple of unusual happiness, he eyes sparkled, and even how to
greet D.

Francisco noted something strange, that filled with alarm.

"Hey, D. Paco, either, and you? ... Y doña Silvia and Rufinita, still
taking baths Manzanares?. Confianzudo this language as it was
contrary to the most timid of temperament and Maxi.

"What got here at this hour?" Asked his aunt, concealed his surprise.
Fortunata is considered carefully, sat away from the main group,
in a chair near the door of the bedroom Doña Lupe.

He was not sat down, and after that hearty greeting as he drove
to the moneylender, it was back to the balcony with his hands in
his pockets, looking at all like someone who expects to receive
congratulations.

"Well, nothing - he said - that I rejoice." - What, do you fell the
lottery - is not that ... What I want lottery? Or lack ...

It is much more than that, because I have found what they sought.
Because I told you he was thinking, I only needed to complete ... a
formula - the combination! ... Well, have you found the _panacea_
- the aunt said with disbelief. - Not a bad name if you want to - said
the poor boy, exalting over every word -. _pan_ Of that means
anything ...

_akos_ and that is the same as saying _remedio_. It heals and purifies
everything, we go ... - Thank God you do something useful! - Doña
Lupe said, suspicious, having the eyes of Maxi, a glow of joy which was
entirely feverish. - all night last night was run very uneasy, as
embers brains, because the plan better, you are not missing more than
one formula to be complete ... The formula ... damn! Finally, now,
a while ago, it occurred to me, gave a jump for joy.

Ballester, who does not understand this, nor understand what ever
became angry with me and I did not want to paper and ink to write the
formula and leave appropriated. ..

I fear that I escape, that I go to the head ... My memory is a cage
open, and birds ... pif ... Doña Lupe Fortunata and looked
sad. "Well -" said the aunt, seeing as it came up a cloud -. Easy,
write the formula, do you _panacea_, have a great success and gained
a lot of money. "- Ah !...-- he exclaimed with the expression that gives
the whole idea of an overwhelming job -. Do not believe you ...
to expose the complete system clearly enough for everyone to
understand, you need to burn your eyebrows ...

I say! I'll have to spend the nights of clear straight. No
matter, when it starts running, you will see, will acquire a
reputation and glory as big, but so great that ... - Goodbye my
money - Doña Lupe muttered, and Fortunata said yes to something.

But, in spite of these tender
reminiscences, d'Orgemont kept on saying, "Don't go near the wall, you
might--"

His eyes never ceased to watch hers, hoping thus to prevent her from
examining too closely the walls of the closet, where the close air was
scarcely enough to inflate the lungs. Marie succeeded, however, in
getting a sufficiently good look in spite of her Argus, and she came
to the conclusion that the strange protuberances in the walls were
neither more nor less than sacks of coin which the miser had placed
there and plastered up.

Old d'Orgemont was now in a state of almost grotesque bewilderment.
The pain in his legs, the terror he felt at seeing a human being in
the midst of his hoards, could be read in every wrinkle of his face,
and yet at the same time his eyes expressed, with unaccustomed fire, a
lively emotion excited in him by the presence of his liberator, whose
white and rosy cheek invited kisses, and whose velvety black eye sent
waves of blood to his heart, so hot that he was much in doubt whether
they were signs of life or of death.

"Are you married?" Well, well ... we That one can not even be sad because the lady
that she is grieving the faces ...

I will dance, if you like.

"I was not accustomed to doña Lupe replies to this temple, and will
soon be disconcerted. Finally had to leave for this entry: "That to
me handle me or not busy, not you who has to decide. ¿So what? Have you
already played emancipated?

You are cool. Do you think you are going to tolerate this canton you
live? I like the smoke from this crazy! ... You settle because you
fix me. "He was so violent and the other was so strained nerves, who
threw a chair off the ground, and put on your sleeve comfortably,
hit a glass of water in it had.

"That is rómpeme seat ... See how the water has spilled. "- Best .--
Yes? ... You mejoraré me, and settle you. - You, madam, is fix their
noses, which I do not fix anyone ... "I do not want trouble, I do not
want to lift no voice - Doña Lupe said rising from his seat -
because they are not aware that unfortunate.

"He left a moment close to doors that do not hear the gresca, and
just returned to the cabinet, saying:" It has fallen asleep.

If you think, not to make noise the rest poor. You're wearing ... Silence!
". - If you are the screams ...

I quietly went well. But strives to find the genius. - Mete noise,
noise gets. Even sleep has left the poor guy. - I, who sleep all
you want. - And what revolts me most is your stubbornness - Doña Lupe
said lowering the voice - and this effort gobernarte single, yes,
this independence stupid ... This way you and what you eat. So
you know demons. Well you used is all that's wrong, very well spent.
Tanta embarrassment had the soul of the wife of Rubin, who was
in anger as she turned with pins, and the minor accident, no one
determine the transition from anger to grief, and a convulsive
energy passivity more sobering.

Something falls within it, and losing all courage, and began to
mourn a child who would find a big prank. Doña Lupe boasted much of
that change of tone, which he considered persuasive powers of their
work. Fortunata dropped into a chair, and over one quarter of an
hour was no articulate word, pressing the handkerchief to his face.
"Yes, aunt ... it is true that I should ... tell you ... I did not
because it seemed improper. What an outrage! Bring stories to this
house ...

I am a miserable, I should not I be here ... To mourn so here is a
trick that I cry. But I can not remedy. I undo the soul. I have to
tell someone that I die of grief, I can not live. If I say no, revient
... You create what you want ... but I am very unhappy. I know that
I deserve, I'm bad, bad custom ... but I am very unhappy. "- There you
go - told doña Lupe moving his right hand with two fingers of her
very stiff, in full episcopal gesture -; what is happening here is
not to do what I tell you. ..

Had you followed the advice I gave you this summer, do not look like
you look. The other was so stifled, that his aunt had to bring him a
glass of water. - Serenata - he said - which I now do not of hassle,
but well worth it.

No, no need to explain what's wrong, just punishment of God. Do you think
I've got no research? I just see your face.

This had to happen, because the bad steps always lead to bad ends ...
The result is that everything that comes out I say. Sin brings
repentance. Again you shelve this man, correct? - Yes, yes ... But how
outrageous!

... - Come on, that both are good. In heaven. Criminal relationships
always end up well. One is in charge of punishing the other, and
which can also be found and punished their trancazo somewhere. Well,
you're brilliant ... Horny behind, beaten and then taken out to dance.
- But how outrageous! - Fortunata say again, looking at her aunt with
her eyes full of tears -.

¿It has not had the audacity to say, between jokes and really, I was
entangled with Ballester?

Pretextos, _tiologías_ and nothing else. Surely you do not cree.
- Hold on, all you have well deserved. Not that I will come to console
... Visiting time, I will not say no. Now open your eyes and you're
horribly alone, without family, without husband, without me. Fortunata,
a panic-like who is drowning, the skirt agarrose Doña Lupe,
and turn loose a torrent of tears. " No, no, no ... I do not want to
be alone, sad me. You tell me something, even if you have patience,
I note that even now ... Yes, I portaré well, now, now. "- I am now.
Go, daughter, am not so much. You do not remember but when Santa
Barbara thunders. What I would draw the correct console now and where
the best of the old days again - not now ... ...-- who now knows you
do not buy ... At the end of the things that have come, I do not
think I speak now, or take sailing in the funeral.

It would be unseemly to me. ... It as well as some of your complicity
in crimes. No, daughter, you come late ...

You've been getting indulgence by the eyes, without you wanted to
see, and now choking you, come to me ...! Alas, I can not, I can
not.

And without saying more, went to the kitchen, thinking that any
severity was not against the woman, and that should terrorize, to
see if the order was submitted in an absolute manner.

Soon made at night. The days dwindled, saddened the hearts of which,
for other reasons, were sad. At half past six in the house was dark,
and Doña Lupe delayed turn the lights as possible. Fortunata, the
fourth of her husband, and almost groping, arrived at the sofa where
he was lying and asked him if he wanted to eat without getting a
response.

I heard the sighs that gave the unhappy, and one of those approaches,
Maxi cogiéndole hands, he squeezed affectionately. Something was in the
soul of Fortunata who responded to this demonstration of affection.

Affection felt towards him behind like a sick child, which protects
outpouring of pity and not asking anything. Doña Lupe brought light,
and looking to dazzle your eyes with husbands by the glow of the
living flame of oil, he said, without doubt encourage Maxi with a
joke: "You are doing the tortolitos ... Account you have to eat more.
Want to eat this here with you. "- Yes, yes, I eat here - the wife
promptly said -. And he will eat well, do you, son? Are not eat
with your wife? She cut off bits of flesh and will give you the. - Well,
I will be sending food - Doña Lupe said, putting the display to the
flame and shortening Quinque -.

Today I have a rice with giblets that's what to eat. At the time they
were alone, before they enter the service and Potato soup, Maxi
foist his wife a few sentences entirely bound to the devilish issue
was their dementia. Fortunata supported him throughout, showing
highly penetrated to the urgency of establishing, as a social reality,
the principle of solidarity of the divine substance.

All said yes, and while they ate, he noticed that the patient is
extremely encouraging as far as display cheerful, talkative and
making a unique heat in his apostolate.

At one point he left out Fortunata asked his aunt: "What gave you
the order these pills?". "Yes indeed. This morning was a fasting, and
I gave him another four. Do you ordered and Ballester ...?».
- Yes ... See for yourself why it is so clever. Go with the hemp!
But nonsense are the same, only now do not see things so black, but
one that takes it smiling.

Volvió beside him, and he was putting the giblets with the fork, and
he ate with the win, not talk and even laugh. His laughter was not
the calm of a madman. Fortunata felt slight comfort in his soul and
said: 'If God wanted to put good ...! But how God is going to do anything
I asked ... If I am the most evil that He has taken the world! For
me, this house has to stop. Where do I withdraw? What will become
of me? But wherever he goes, I am glad to know this poor, the only thing
I really wanted, which I have been forgiven forgive me twice and
the third ... and the fourth ... I think I also forgive the
fifth, if not the head like a bell. And this is my fault. Oh, Christ,
what remorse so great! I'll go with this weight around, and can not even
breathe. "After eating, he was lively, which had not been in a long
time, but their concepts were very bizarre that you can imagine.
Accessing and doña Silvia Rufinita, visit Doña Lupe went to the room
with them, and husbands were left alone.

Maxi was lifted and stretched all over the body, raising his arms.
The bones creak, which made various contortions seemed a gym and then
sit down again, hugging his wife and staying with it (it was sitting
on a bench next to the sofa) in attitude similar to that taken by
theater lovers when they go to say something nice in tenths or
Quintillan. - iv - 'My Life - said in the sweetest tone of the world
- a thousand thanks for the consolation that you have given me with
your words.

"Fortunata not knew what those words were that he was comforted, but
what it took. He made an affirmative sign, and forward. "Why are you
under me, I do not want more. My aspirations are fulfilled. Long
live the great principle of the release by the release, by the
cancellation !...».

- Vivaaa ...!

- So what will the crowds, when this doctrine spreads, but this is not
up to us, but that will come later. Follow the law you and I die when
we arrived at the point of creating the sweet purity. Kill the beast
when it is completely disconnected their prisoner, the spiritual
substance, and the hedgehog shows ripe chestnuts. - No, son, that
will kill .-- I love to see you well.

Is there anything more beautiful than death? ¡Dying, end of
sentence, get rid of all these miseries, in so much pain and all
the filth on earth!

             Is there anything that compares to this supreme good ...

¿Sees nothing more sublime soul - And then? - Fortunata said that even
knowing who he spoke, he heard with pleasure that way of death. - Oh,
then feel an absolutely pure belonging to the divine substance; a
recognized part of it, and Todito with all that great ... What this so
great! - Do not suffer the others ...!-- muttered leaning his
head on his chest -. Do not fear if you do this to one or the other
perrería ...!, not seen in agony, and never enjoy, enjoy, enjoy
... Your mind will be left on the wings of this sublime idea, lost
in space and invisible without borders. 'Feeling good after
irradiation itself, and covered everything in that a substantial
and ethereal, infinitely perfect and healthy, beautiful, transparent
and pleasant ...!». This was already a little metaphysical, and not
Fortunata as well understood. What was it accessible to the idea
first: death, lacerias off of this world, and feel identical to the
person then living person, enjoying all there is to enjoy and love
and being loved is not with rapture that never end. " Dear me -
told Maxi moving much head and muscles of the face, a strong sign
of nervous excitement - and the two die after we have fulfilled our
mission.

And for you to penetrate either yours, I will say what I have learned
from heavenly revelation. Fortunata was prepared to hear the great
folly that her husband announced, and put a face very serious attack.
"Well I know one thing you do not know, but maybe you feel it, and
that you may know soon. You may have begun to notice any symptoms, but
your spirit will have no present of this great event. "Looked so,
she began to panic. What would God, what would it be? Maxi was a while
in silence, their eyes riveted on her as bolts, and finally told
him that these words did shake: 'You're on tape. Quedose a
while, the unhappy woman petrified. I tried to take a joke, tried
to deny it, but for any of these determinations had value. Immense
terror filled his soul to see Maxi said what he said with an expression
of the largest security. But the last thing to Fortunata was left was
to hear this, with the exaltation of light, and with appalling
escalation of nervous shaking of the head: "It was a revelation.
The spirit that has brought me instructing me this idea last night
... Bonitísimo mystery, right? You're pregnant ... And you presume,
rather, you know, I'm aware of in your face, what hidden because it
ignores that this has not shed any shame on you. The child
who got in your guts is the son of Pure Thought, which has
sought to incarnate to bring salvation to the world. You were chosen
for this miracle, for you have suffered a lot, because you have loved
much, because you have sinned greatly. Suffering, love and sin ... see
why the three infinitive of the verb of existence. Arise from
you the true Messiah.

We are nothing more than precursors, do you know you? Nothing more
than precursors, and the birth of you and I will have fulfilled
our mission and we will liberate our killing beasts. Fortunata got
the jump on the other end of the room. Habíale entered this
panic, which leaves little to the corridor asking relief. Maxi was
broken and his face transfigured, and his eyes seemed lit coals. Even
repaired his wife had been away from him and continued talking as
if they were still on the side. The unhappy, troubled and scared to
death, is nestled in the opposite corner, and hands crossed, watching
the crazy bastard, saying to himself: "What you have dealt with ...
God, what a man! Will all this farce of madness? Will and pretend to
be able to kill without justice will pursue ...? But how to be discovered
... If I have not told anyone! If you do not know me yet ...
nothing! Ah, what this man has is a lot of mischief.

It says the revelation to fool people ... Certainly it appears, I fear,
or I had not known what I know ... What have I said in my dreams ...
Although no; may have guessed by his own folly. Do not say that the
great truths the children know and crazy ...? Oh, what has scared
me! God, save me from this tribulation. This man makes me want to
kill all these comedies and revenge for me and kill me as bóbilis bóbilis
...». lighting was towards his wife, cogiéndola by an arm. She felt
such fear, until he encountered forces inferior to those of her
husband, who was so weak. "Monuc mine - said tightening arm with nervous
energy, and looking with an expression that looked confused at the
unhappy lover and murderer -. We liberate through a drain loose, since
you've fulfilled your mission. When will it be? Back in February
or March. "- Should be in March - Fortunata thought - but for
you was ... I'll save myself. Kill you, if you want, I have to live
to raise them, and I will be so happy with it ...! Will be the
consolation of my life. For that I have, and for that God has given
me ... See how I left with my idea ... My son is a new life for me.
And then there will not be me ... cough Oh, if you do not feel in
here, me and you'd be equally as crazy as each other, and then we had
to kill it. Oíase the run of the run off and Ms Silvia Rufinita in
the corridor. Just came to Jackson, and seeing his nephew, went
to the couch, leaving his wife standing in the middle of the room.
"What? - Said Dona Lupe -. Are there sleep? Are the eleven. "-
You've come to disturb our happiness - Maxi replied sitting and
moving their legs in the air -. My choice and I want to be
alone, entirely alone. The ineffable mystery that her and me ...
- But what are these volteretas you give? (not knowing whether to
laugh or get serious). You look like a acrobats. - What it is and I
have revealed ... ineffable mysteries, I say ... lead us to a
delicious ecstasy, not ordinary people can participate. - Call me
vulgar! ... - The vulgarity is very attached to the land property
... ie, do mime the beast. - But what, you'll also give tours of ram -
Doña Lupe said frightened, seeing hands in support of the sofa and then
bend the head to play with the gutta-percha. - What I give, you do not
mind, a woman of little faith ... The night is cold and I need to enter
the extremities warm. I have been inside the skull on a burner. -
Do you see ... Fortunata said ...?-- you see, not demure say aloud
-.

The effect of these pills convicted. I think it should not be given
more. You see how you is: it disrupts the brain over and guess the
secret. - How to guess the secret ...? But, boy, what are you doing?
Rubín sat and stood, with boats in the seat, like a jockey who rides
in the English manner. "Back in March will be the big event, the
admiration of the world - the unhappy gruñía, giving turns on
itself -. We will announce a star that has appeared in the West, Heaven
and earth resound with hymns of joy. "- But what are you saying?
Come on, son of my soul, be quiet. - What I would like to know
now is where my hat - he said, looking under the table and the
couch. - And what you want for the hat - I leave, I have to go to
the street. But it does come out with their heads uncovered. Makes a
horrible heat. - Yeah, let's go to the Retiro.

Fortunata, take the candle and you ahead. And grabbed the arm of youth
ventura, took him to the bedroom. Maxi jump was planted in the bed,
keeping a moment with his arms and legs held high. Dropped
heavily after the extremity to return to lifting. "Nice night, we
will pass!" Exclaimed Doña Lupe crossing hands. Fortunata,
meditabunda discouraged and was dropped on the sofa. "Do not you succeed
where I am - said the poor insane -. I have fallen from heaven on a
roof. What does my wife so we can not come to my relief? ". -
Well, yes sir, Nice night! - Doña Lupe repeated, casting a sigh for
every word. They tried to sleep. But it was not possible.
They escaped from the hands, with a lively child, who sometimes seemed
agility monkey. His laughter caused dismay to both ladies, and lately
he is not understand a word of many let go run his mouth, acting as
a primitive, as the kids who are starting to talk. Finally the wear
was nervous to pay, and was still on the sofa with one leg on the
table, the other on a chair, her head beneath a pillow and your arms
outstretched in a cross. One hand was on the floor, and the other
was caught under the body, giving the arm a round that seemed unlikely.
They refused them several difficult position, fearing that if he played
was alborotaría again and would give them another headache. Doña
Lupe doze, sitting in a chair beside the bed of marriage, but not
hit Fortunata eyes all night. And dawn when sleeping. Just give
agreement itself, Gemi and its movement as if it sticks to the
ground and ruin wretched body. - V - I think it was the day of conception
when Rubín left his room with a knife in his hand behind of potato,
saying it had killed. The shock of the aunt and Fortunata was very big
and hard they take the murder weapon, which was a knife from the table,
with which it was not easy to kill anyone.
As soon
as Mademoiselle de Verneuil had turned the creaking hinges of the
lower door she smelt an intolerable ammoniacal odor, and saw that the
beasts in the stable had kicked through the inner partition which
separated the stable from the dwelling. The interior of the farmhouse,
for such it was, did not belie its exterior.

Mademoiselle de Verneuil was asking herself how it was possible for
human beings to live in such habitual filth, when a ragged boy about
eight or nine years old suddenly presented his fresh and rosy face,
with a pair of fat cheeks, lively eyes, ivory teeth, and a mass of
fair hair, which fell in curls upon his half-naked shoulders. They
had set up lights and large mug in front of him, it seemed to shudder,
almost like the Fehmgericht. I hid me in her behind a nearby barrel,
and heard what they said.

Georg von Hewen spoke with poignant words to them and put them before
her infidelity, he said, as she had no need to show them how to
provide long with stocks that, as your Highness would collect an
army, to the horror of Tübingen , but rather as the besieger in
need as they could. "" Ha!

Wacken Hewen, and what they gave to the answer? "" She laughed and
drank. 'Then it was good while before the gathering an army! Where
the money hernehmen not steal? " asked one. Hewen but went on and said:
If it is not as soon possible, so they should still hold up to the
last man, as you zugeschworen, otherwise they acted as traitors to
their Lord. As she laughed again and drank and said: 'Who will arise
and call us traitors? " I cried behind my barrel out: 'I, your boys,
you are traitors at Duke and at the Country! " Everyone was terrified,
the stadium had his mug fall, but I came out, took my cap and
the false beard, put me out and moved Euern letter from the doublet.
'Here is a letter from your Duke,' said I, 'he wants, you will not
give you but to keep him, he even wants to come and join you win or die
in these walls. "" Oh, Tübingen, "said the duke with sighs, "how
foolish I was that I left you!

  Two fingers of my left I
  would be around you, what do I say two fingers?

The rights could I leave, I could so that you are buying! And with
the left, I wanted the federal government show the way! And they
gave nothing, nothing at all to my words? "" The wrong people saw
me in dark and seemed not to know what they should do. Hewen but cautioned
them again. As Ludwig said of the stadium, I would already be too late.
Twenty-eight of knighthood wanted the feud with the Federation and the
Duke go this alone can make. Will he return to military power into the
country, so they wanted to him faithfully, but they wanted to
uncertainty over the war will not continue, because their castles
and goods for so long would be damaged and burned until they no longer
oppose the federal government served. I ask now, they should
hinaufführen me in the Knights' Hall, I wanted to try and see if there
were not men, the castle keep, I counted on, for whom I have faithfully
kept the Nippenburg the Gültlingen to Ow, the two Berlichingen; the
Westertoren Stetten, which Hofen Elter, Schilling, Reischach, Wölwart,
Kaltental, of Hewen but shook his head and said that I did in some
wrong. "" And Stammheim, Thierberg, Westertoren Stetten, my faithful,
you have not seen it?

" "Oh yes, she sat in the basement at the stadium Euern and drank
wine. Hinauf they wanted to but I can not. Even Hewen even Freinberg
Heideck and who were with him, as advised, they said, the two
parties were already hard against each other anyway, the stadium
had a majority for himself and also the largest part of the servants.

If I go up, come in the courtyard in the knight's hall and to the fight,
and there they remained less than nothing left but to die.

So glad they are now also for you the last drop of blood demanding,
so they wanted to but rather in the field of battle against the
enemy, as by their fellow countrymen and brothers arms are killed.

There was nothing left to me when they ask, they want to get the
Prince Christoph and your gentle daughter accept them and the castle
at the transfer received.

Some have said to others silent and twitched the armpits, but I gave
my curse traitors and as a Christian knight, said five of them and
invited them to struggle in life and death, if the war had ended,
then I turned and went the same route from the castle, as I came. ""
God in heaven!

If I had that possible, "cried Lichtenstein"-two knights, two hundred
servants, a strong castle, and they betray!

Our good name is abused, even in late hours will be from our nobility
and how they speak their prince abandoned house, the saying: 'fairly
and honestly as a Württemberger', has become the mockery!

"" Well you could once say 'like a true Württemberger' ", said Ulrich
Herzog, and a tear fell into his beard." When my ancestor once hinabritt
gen Eberhard of Worms and the Elector, Count and gentlemen sat at
table, as they spoke and praised much of their preference countries.

One boasted his wine, the other spoke of his fruit, even the third
of his game, the fourth iron dug in its mountains. Since there was also
at the Eberhard beard.

Fulminans that if love and above all that as improvised consortium gave
a lot to say, commenting and murmuring. Andaluces In places, there
is nothing to knock as much as a sudden wedding.

For everything there is usually done with a lot of pause. Nowhere less
acceptable is the English adage that time is _The dinero_. Nowhere
is used more frequently and in practical life and the arch-typical
sentence from Spanish _hacer tiempo_ ie, losses, expenses, and
without us even bore his walk slow and quiet infinity.

But where most Andalusia is the extreme _hacer tiempo_ is in engagement.
Contributes to this, on the one hand, caution, recognizing the
grave and momentous marriage, we recommend continued: _antes cases
you, look what I haces_.

And contributes much more, on the other hand, this _mirar which
hace_ is extremely fun, it's the best way to kill time or make it
is a pleasant occupation, which is who is not, and that it is not
home is left without her.

Hence, no doubt, endless courtship of my land, which also provides
the finest examples of firm consistency that can record the stories
of love.

Engagement must start when the groom is in the grips learning Latin,
passed through the humanities, the law or medicine, and do not end
in marriage, until the groom is a judge of first instance or licensed
physician.

During this time recorded when the bride and groom are absent, and
when they are in the same town, are at Mass in the morning, come back
to see two or three times during the day, peel the pava often
nap during the return to be in the afternoon on the promenade,
going to the salon from eight to eleven o'clock, and, after dinner,
and look at re talking on the grate, and there are nights that are
peeling the other pava time, and chewing iron out toward the East
until the dawn of the fingers of pink.

In verifying this is a boyfriend of Antequera, who finally had to
marry at eight years of being a boyfriend, and that is not well
married, showed afligidísimo for not knowing what to do with their
time.

Another boyfriend, from Carcabuey I heard I count as a testament
to how ingrained is the idea that marriage requires a lot of calm
before you perform, that her future mother-in-law, whereas his
daughter had already thirteen years speak with one boyfriend, but
he came to ask, and she was a little wilted and ajando was resolved
to ask the groom what brought intentions.

Francine, full of dreadful fears, had waited for her mistress
throughout the night, and when she saw her she began to speak; but
Marie, with a kindly gesture, silenced her.

"I am not dead, my child," she said. "Ah!" she added, after a pause,
"I wanted emotions when I left Paris, and I have had them!"

Francine asked if she should get her some food, observing that she
must be in great need of it.

- I tell you I will not ... I will not. - But No aunt aunt ...--
worth.

I've said it, but you want to. You think you do not read my thoughts?
How can you hide in front of me! Well, no, no-salt with it. I'm
not going there but if you bear me tied hand and foot. - Then take
the tied hands and feet - Maxi said, laughing. I wanted to, yes, but
as was his approach and his constant line formed of conduct drawn,
there was an excessive value to what the visit might be. See where the
force of circumstances had to doña Lupe in a situation of inferiority,
and the poor kid who months earlier did not dare to grumbling in
front of her, watched her aunt on equal footing. The dignity of his
passion had made the child a man, and that ennobles the plebeian, watched
his former autocrat with respect but without fear. As Nicholas visited
a few days to Fortunata to teach Christian doctrine, he was furious
Doña Lupe . So many comings and goings said she had scrambled to his
stomach. But the feeling that really made her scream was like it
was envy and Nicholas could not go there. For this reason went
something desavenidos aunt and nephew. It was March, and the day
of San José Nicolás at the table said: "Auntie, there is strawberry.
But did the indirect economic effect on the widow. Returned
to the clerical burden on different occasions: 'What I saw strawberry
richer today! Auntie, how far is the strawberry? ". - I do not know,
nor me - she replied - because, as I have not until you get three
real ... Nicholas gave a sigh, Doña Lupe while saying to himself: "As
no commas over strawberries that I put you, tragaldabas, aviado you."
And as Doña Lupe was a gourmand, one days brought a cone of strawberry,
well hidden in the blanket, but no put it on the table. After
the meal, and while Nicolas read _The Correspondencia _ _ The
Papelito_ or in the dining room, Mrs. Lupe was locked in his room to
eat strawberries or sprinkled with sugar.

As the priest was dropped onto the street, went out of his hiding
Doña Lupe to offer a little of that Maximiliano tasty fruit, and
went into his room with the saucer and spoon.

Much appreciated this fine boy, and ate the candy. Mirabal eat expectant
care with her aunt, and when left on the plate not more than six
or seven strawberries, take it away from hands, saying: "This is
for Daddy to each eye like a bream."

The kid ate strawberries, and then, with the tongue that gave him
the plate, leaving it as if he had washed. - vii - Juan Pablo
very little attention to the case of Maximilian, and all other family
matters, and not the inheritance. His desire was soon to pay their
charge traps. Came very late at night, and almost always ate outside,
so very grateful Doña Lupe, as Nicholas voraciousness spot him with
his unbalanced household budgeting. The misanthropy it came to John
Paul's return from his snubbing Real Cuartel was not altered in those
days that followed the inheritance. He spoke little, and when he named
the Doña Lupe Maxi wedding, or when one beats a alfilerazo not to
fall asleep, stood shoulder, said words of disdain towards his brother
and nothing more. "With him eat his bread ... What about me what?
". Carlism of not talking at home, Doña Lupe because not consented.
But one morning the two older brothers were so engaged in conversation,
rather dispute that damn case did not the lady.

John Paul was in his fourth washing, Nicholas came to say I do not
know how, and if the priest Santa Cruz was a bandit or a madman,
were engaged, engaged until ...

"You want me to tell you one thing -- "cried the first, decomposing
-. Because Don Carlos has not already won by your fault, the fault of
the priests.

You should go there, as he ido me to deal with the intrigues of the
basement gentualla who wants everything for himself, and does not go
more than gossip and slander to discredit those who really work. I could
not be there, I was suffocating.

I told Dorregaray: 'My general, I do not know how you hang it,' and he
stood shoulder, by putting a face ... ¡! No day passed that the Owls
will bring a story to Don Carlos. Dorregaray in which he deals with
Moriones to surrender, which he had offered Moriones ten million
reais in short, a thousand indecent. When he came to my notice that
they accused me of having gone to the headquarters Moriones errands
to keep my head, I flew, and that same evening, having met in the lobby
atrium of the church of San Miguel, I linked the blanket to the head,
and there a little gun Dos de Mayo. "There are no more traitors to
you. What they have is envy of the traitor, if he had, for the
benefits he gets from his betrayal. I would not for ten million,
but ten thousand Ochavo sell you the King and all his descendants;
infamous thieves, uncles of Judas. " Anyway, if unable to pass the Goiri
colonel, who loved me and take me by force and I started from there and
brings me to my house that afternoon to get the Redan a cure to see
the sunset .

I was three days in bed with a stroke of Amager. When I got up, I
asked an audience to His Majesty. His answer was to get the tube
in your hand and the passport for the border. Anyway, that
gave me _engarza-rosarios_ ground, because it gave me to help them
in their machinations against the loyal and brave.

In the basement lost Carlos V, and VII did not take the lesson.
There are any. Do not want religion, then why have it; atrácate
cures, and indigéstate bursts. - It is an appreciation of you -
said Nicholas moderate their wrath - which does not seem very well
founded ... this is the thing. - What do you know what the world
and reality?

You're in the clouds. - And you, I think you're something ido, because
you care that nonsense. - Shut up, stupid ...-- said Nicholas,
sulphides. - You know what I mean -- Juan Pablo cried, raising
the voice arrogant - that I was not commanded silence, are we?

I had the honor of telling four fresh Bishop of Persepolis, and who
is not afraid to purple cassocks, what fear has to have the black
... - Well, I tell you ...-- Added Nicolás decomposed, tremulous
and not knowing if they threaten with their fists or with words -
I tell you that you're a chisgarabís. - What is the fuss?

- cried Doña Lupe entering bring peace -. Go with these gentlemen! And
told them again to ojalateros gentlemen who wish to dispute over when
to leave to do so to the street. In my house I do not want scandals.
- It is with this that you can not discuss gross ...-- said Nicholas,
that he could barely breathe and was so choked. Juan Pablo said
nothing and continued dressing, turning his back on his brother. "Oh
you missed a genius! - Doña Lupe said, without looking he - -.

You could consider that your brother is a priest ...

Above all, do not come from echándotela plane, went wrong because if
you go to the infamous _The facción_, and you had to get their hands
on their heads, what do we blame others?. "Juan Pablo is not
deigned to reply.

Doña Lupe grabbed the arm by a priest took him and afraid to get
engaged again.

Maximilian was in the dining room and sat for lunch. I had heard the
scuffle with a given Higa of what was. Beyond them. A Nicolas berrinchín
not removed her appetite, as no disruption of the mind, how big
it was, could deprive him of his most characteristic manifestation
organic.

The three heard screaming in the street, and Doña Lupe put attention,
believing it to be a newspaper announcing _extraordinario_ wins
on liberal Carlist army.

In those days of 1874, newspaper supplements often, keeping the
neighborhood continued anxiety.

"Papito - Mrs. - takes two quarters to buy and download _extraordinario
of Gaceta_.

I will see how good some of them have Tollin to _tersos_.

"Nicholas had heard that sutilísimo, after a while and shut to
silence everyone, said:" But, Auntie, you are not crazy.

If there is such a cry of _extraordinario_. What the voice said, clearly
hear ... The _freeeesero ... fresa_. "- may well be - Doña Lupe
replied, keeping her purse earlier than before -. But it is so
green, that is pure vinegar ... - All is God - it was said Nicholas
sighed -. Became worse as Jesus, who asked him water and ice. Chewing
the last bite left Maximilian to go to class, carrying the burden of
his books, and long after John Paul lunched alone.

Those lunches served at different times to bother much doña Lupe. Is
believed that his nephews that house was an inn? The only consideration
was that the war was that fewer and fewer Maxi was eating the pulp
of the angel, always restrained, even after he returned Tarumba the
eyes of a woman. Doña Lupe thought about it that afternoon, sewing
in the seat beside the balcony of the street without the company
of the cat.

"Whatever you want, is the best of the three - he thought, poking and
pulling the needle - egoistón better than that of Nicholas, better
than Tarambana Juan Pablo ...

What do you want to marry a ...? Must see, must see that. You can not
judge without hearing ... It could not happen without ... There are
cases ... Oops ... And love is like a fool ... And what can we do?
God has his hand. "Nicholas came from the street and asked about doña
Lupe, he's coming home _basilisco_.

That day was more satisfied, to ensure that its catechumens
understand things of religion, and that what appeared to be _de
good moral madera_, which reached its height of curiosity, and his
widow was unable to sustain longer paper that was disdainful.

"Whether you endeavor - told the student that night - which in the
end what you get." - What, Auntie?

- Let me go in person to see that ... But that record is if I go against
my will. Maximilian, who was kind and wanted to be okay with
her, she wanted to express indifference. "Yes, aunt, if you go to see
her, we thank all our lives." - No, I do need your acknowledgments,
if I decide to go, not yet ... I know - Yes, Aunt .-- Neither I, if I
decide that, because I agradezcáis but by measuring it with my own
eyes the entire depth of the abyss in which you want to throw, can
you still find his way apartarte. - tomorrow , aunt, and I accompany
her to you - the boy said enthusiastically -.

You see me deep, and push me when I see it. And the next day doña Lupe
dressed Trapitos with a Christian, because he had previously gone
to the great role of asylum Doña Guillermina, for this invitation,
which was very satisfied.

I wanted to give the coup, and had so much grip on himself and expressed
with so much ease, easy to be judged much luster in the visit. This
was in effect. Rarely in her life, even in the best days of
Jackson, were both Doña Lupe ratatouille in that interview, because
so little is the _basilisco_ strong social arts and being self-conscious
as their situation and their bad reputation, the other be dispatched
to your liking and to an extent empingorotó incredible. Doña Lupe
tried his alleged niece with civility, but keeping the distance. Was
known only in minor details, that the visit was a bitter-skinned
girl with recommendations pretensions of decency, and a lady
visitor, not a woman either, but Mrs. Jackson, a man more honest and
more healthy habits that had existed at any time in Madrid or at least
in Puerta Cerrada. His condition was proved that lady after having
done everything possible in the first part of the visit to show
some early severity, found at the second coming or fall a bit on
the side of leniency. The real lordship is pleased to never humiliate
the less. Doña Lupe felt so alive with a win of protection for
Fortunata, who can not take account of the advice given and rules of
conduct that used to plot. Dags is to protect, manage, advise and take
on someone who dominate ... One of the things that you did in grace
Fortunata, was his shyness to express themselves. You knew right away
who did not speak like people fine, and that he was afraid and
ashamed to say nonsense.

This opinion in favor of Mrs. Lupe because desenfado in language would
have been a sign of lawlessness in the will. 'Do not you hurry - the
widow told him, touching his knee with his family range - and
that is not possible in one day learn to speak like us. That will
come with time and use, and treatment. Say a bad word is not to shame
anyone, but he has not received a thorough education not to blame
for this. "Fortunata punishment was going on with that black _tantismo
cumplido_ visit, and it was a color and was came, not knowing how to
answer the questions of whether Doña Lupe or smile or get serious. What
they wanted was to start soon.

They spoke of going to the convent, the resolution praised aunt
Maxi much, striving to get his head the more words and more alambic
requetefinos.

To that end had to go in this, that Fortunata quedose fasted many
things you heard. Finally came the moment of farewell, Fortunata who
eagerly wished and feared considered unable to say with clarity
and calm all those formulas and the latest offering from the house.

Jackson did the person in this race; Fortunata stutters, and all said
the opposite. Maximiliano spoke little during the visit. Merely be
_al quite_, going to the cape where Fortunata was endangered by
clumsiness of language.

Doña Lupe when he left, believed to be accompanied to the street, and
did so. "If a widow bobona ...-- said his nephew -; in heaven ...
seems to have caught with the lasso . In the hands of an intelligent
person, this woman could be straightened, because it must be wrong
fund.

But I doubt you ...». - viii - Doña Lupe was a person of good
taste and instantly appreciated the beauty of the place _basilisco_
without hesitation, as is customary in trials and use in women.

Even those with no pretensions of beauty are reluctant to proclaim
the others.

"It is really nice - said yes to the widow, on his way to his house
- which is called beautiful.

But it is one that needs the wild domestiques. The desire to learn
Fortunata said that you like a lot, and felt it was waved in his soul,
itching to exercise their skills as a teacher, counselor, protector
and head of household.
After watching him till he reached
the rocks of Saint-Sulpice, Marie nodded her head in sign of
satisfaction, saying to herself in a low voice: "That fat fellow has
given me more than his life for his life! I can make him my creator at
a very little cost! Was successful in June the French failure to
Heiligkreuz; succeeded them, the church and the village just before
the batteries anzuzünden Oestreicher, some prisoners and to not
withdraw without a loss here.

The 10 th June dared the French attack on one days Gunzenheim, although
was knocked off, but us because of the left wing, and particularly
because of the Darmstadt camp, some time in embarrassment and
concern continued. 11 June.

The camp Ihro Majesty the King was now about 1000 steps on Marie Born,
and created, especially on the slopes, where the large kettle in which
Mainz is to cease, in ascending Lehmwänden and hills, which gave
rise to the graceful bodies occasion.

The easy-to-treated soil had the hands of skilled gardeners, which
make up the kindly park with little effort formed: the dependent side
was geböscht and lawn shows bowers built on communication and
descending passageways dug planed surfaces, where the military in
its grandeur and delicacy throughout the show was the adjacent woods
and bushes with the plan pulled in, so that when the delicious
prospect could want nothing more than all of these areas also worked
to see to the beautiful parks of the world to enjoy.

Our carefully Krause signed the prospect with all its current
owner. 14 June.

A small hill which the French had built beneath Weissenau and
kept busy, was the opening of the parallels in the way it should
be taken at night, and several of them went to people briefed on
this side of our walls, right wing, from where you overlook the
whole situation could.

In the very dark night is now expected, because the agency knew
quite well, while our troops were sent, and resistance to attack
by a brisk fire plays an important type.

One long-awaited, it is forgiveness, instead, but we saw a far more
lively appearance. All items had attacked our position, because in the
whole circle that we saw a brisk fire, without which we could
conceive of any reason, on the spot but, by the fact the speech should
be, everything was dead and silent.
Then noticing that Francine was taking out a number of the new
Republican coins, she cried out, "Not those; they would get us
murdered. Send Jeremie to Corentin--no, stay, the wretch would follow
me--send to the commandant; ask him from me for some six-franc
crowns."

With the feminine sagacity which takes in the smallest detail, she
thought of everything. All you need to wrestle, if it floats Nöthen,
Only you can bring Hülfe, By the whole lives. # # # # To you, to you,
etc. In a strong hand you wear the earth with man and mouse,

singing a little break, then voted them into a faster beat to the
following three verses: Vivat! Oath, at the highest non-puppet, but
only after clock and after the string The beautiful art piece!

# # # # From their Zier # # # # Uses human and animal # # # # The

'Gackeleia popeia YOU! I woke up on the beautiful singing and had been
in sense and stand up for the night thanks to music, but I was afraid,
then they do not want to end their Gegenkomplimenten, and so I was
silent and then mice seemed like a Ratz to sleep until the singer
had moved on, but then, I am up and saw the most beautiful Procession
a little.

At the head went the beautiful art piece, surrounded by the royal
family and the whole court. Among the Hoffräulein I saw a much too
large, curious person respond, she was like a giant among them, danced
more than they went, and her voice did not fit into the song. This was
followed by several strange mouse, they differed not only by shape,
size and color, but also, unfortunately, mostly through their
behavior is not very edifying, they looked around a lot and always
whispered to each other very pressing.

I found out later who they were. They followed all adelichen gender,
among the most beautiful sex of white mice of high delicacy and
tenderness existed. All of which I now speak up, wore flares from
luminous beetles consisting locust, which they had herumschweifenden
bats capture them. This was followed by the Civic and now finally
the country mice, all in their national - and natural colors,
which served the blazing splinters of rotten wood as torches, which
they are passing on an old willow stump abbissen. I can not
tell you how solemnly the train of many small lights on the streets
of the quaint town of mice hinan the hill in the venerable cathedral
into wound - it was as if the spark in a tinder verglimmenden lobes
hinlaufen, nor do you know father , you said to me sometimes in
Gelnhausen on fire, "these are the Student Chen, from the school
run", I thought this still your speech.

Before the door of the church empfieng a very elegant mouse to the top
of the other church mice the beautiful art piece, and the courtyard,
and led them in the cathedral, which I now made all its openings
was enlightened, then I heard whistling softly singing, what is silent
mice ward .-- Now that everything in the church, and the whole town
was silent and Todt, threw me a glance at the strange building in
the star light. Oh, because my heart grew, the world was too narrow,
it was far to the soul, my hair seemed to me feelings and desires
that are longed, in the winds to play, and I gave them to him, because,
horch ' Now came also a labor and encouraged the treetops of the
grove to see, and the image of our earth, the moon, came as a
secret now, the business schools, the night came, drunk stars, and
probably slightly distressed to give us the astonishing there shone
the Fremdlingin among the people, sad and beautifully Gebirgsanhöhen
up! - Oh! because I thought nothing more, as if only the father
and mother here, and if even only Kronovus here would be that I
could mittheilen what I feel! - yes dear parents, it giebt impression
that a poor child can not act alone, where it wants to clip to a firmer
intimate care, such as a rock, a tree of the shore, if the
current swell of emotion and us into the rapidly wide sea of enthusiasm
there wants to contribute - but nowhere is this more the case than
with great architecture in the Moonlight "- since Gackeleia gave a
little in the narrative, Ms.

Hinkel shut them heartily and said:" O that is a very poetic place,
oh that's from my heart, yes you are my child, my heart - and soul
full of children, even once I would have to Gelnhausen in Pallast
Barbarossa's Moonlight in the stream of sensation into the sea of
enthusiasm then rapidly taken -- Gockel but father was with me and
making a so that I do not feel so all could. "-" Stay with the
truth, "said Gockel," you've got two things felt, you've got to the
butcher shop and bakery and the thought of getting colds . Gackeleia
you but, I say: I would have to me very wrong, or you are a Schwärmerin
with your moldy cheese, pumpkins, old Reuter boots, saddles, bags and
patron Gothic churches in the moonlight - and I think your feelings
in the moonlight, not childish enough expressed wert thou then already
been so great as now, it would be like words to forgive, but as
you were hardly a few hours away ."--" Ruthe father ", erwiederte
Gackeleia," entschuldiget me, I'm through the ring Salomonis now
as an adult virgin and can not be more All as a small Gackeleia
arguments, I say as a virgin, what I felt as a child, and surely,
father, as a child, I have only spoken differently. "" God, you can
always be , always a child at the same time Seyn, "Gockel said,"
but continue to tell, so we made the curious town to come out -
now, where you have the ring Salomonis, you need the power of the
yearning sensation is no longer around to bail - now says, turning
'the ring, and you will be so much trees on the banks of the longing,
that you can burn to coals and finally have to exclaim: "Ah, it's
Everything, Everything monotony!

o vanity of vanities and all vanity, saith even the wise Solomon
and his signet ring will not contradict him - but more narrative
Gackeleia heart! "" Yes, "went Gackeleia continued," I like my heart
so big, my soul so far felt I knew well that every creature
begehret subject of vanity and verlanget and always continue seufzet
and tortures, so I went around and looked into all angles, even
if no care da sey, where I could unpack my heart, and sang with silent
before me that: "Mother-Seelig quite alone, as the silent moonlight
Schauet into the city, the small Gackeleia In the wide world still
Seyn How Everything is clear and pure, As light and everything is
fine, How is everything in the club two and two, and my and your , But
I, I am alone, all alone Mutterseelig! "Then I heard a few steps from
my Moosbettchen removes an muffled sound, as quiet, hidden cat
yelling, which led me to the pious mice was very worried, and I
crept quietly adding me and found of thorns and thistles grow on an
old, empty there are ton of powder, the bung hole was swept against
me, the moon shone into it - I even looked into it - oh dear parents!
I saw something so horrible that I am the horror like a goose bumps
covered in the old powder tonne, which was missing a ground, there
were five young male, which I find my greatest fear - oh, they were
to me only to become known: - the five sons Schurrimurri's, Mack,
Benack, Gog, Magog and demagogic recognized.

They were therefore unaware of the execution - Schurrimurri but her
mother had suffered their punishment because they were sitting around
their Todtenkopf around in an old Alongeperücke was .-- Mack seemed a
vehement speech, but only softly, quietly, all made big hump, spreitzten
the hair, and beat each other of the fur with its tail, the fire
that sparks were flying around, sometimes they could not quite Grimm
oppress and let a dull murmur and whimper like a subterranean earthquake,
listen to it, with their claws weitvorgestreckten on the Todtenkopf
like daggers, whetted. The whole thing was in the barrel of moons
lit something highly greyish, treacherous; me was when I see in hell
and unwillkührlich came into my soul, this is a conspiracy to mutiny,
save your friends who are devout mice! These criminals have already
been addressed, they can not escape their punishment .-- I bethought
me not long caught the kegs at the rear end and put it upright so
that it looks like a bell on the whole conspiracy was, the young cats
elbow was caught, and the bung hole I plugged with a piece of
grass. I put so much more stones on the barrel, when I rush in the
rings could find, so that prisoners do not want to upset, and went
myself with the feelings, a noble act to have done, after my Moosbettchen,
I listened a bit after the barrel out, but they were quite silent,
and so I covered my eyes on the apron, jerked a little and slept a sweet
sleep. After a while I dreamed, the princesses Mandelbiß come back
with a beautiful art piece to me and say my ear: "Gackeleia,
make me go and put the art piece next to you in her cot, she is probably
as tired as I Seyn, I want me in your hair to your Oehrchen and
explain everything to you, what you in the beautiful procession 've
seen and how our Hofredner Muskulus so beautifully spoken. "that I
half-dreaming, as she demanded, then put them in my hair and chatted
to me like an ear Schlafkamerädchen; since then everything I have heard
the following: The large, strange person who, to me at the Princess
Sissi of Hoffräulein so much liked, was a noble mountain mouse,
the Marquise Marmotte which from which a prisoner escaped
Savoyardenbuben, here at the Court waited a decent chance to return
to their homeland zurückzureisen.

Sissi was not good to talk to them, because Prince Speckelfleck had
too often after her around too much and they praised what they are no
human rights could suffer. He admired her dancing, her beautiful
dreams, and above all their Vorderpfötchen like .-- Sissi, blind to
all these advantages, said: "Vorderpfötchen! It's almost ridiculous to
me! Stories in all natural stands of the marbles animals: their
front feet have four toes and a very short thumb, the hind feet five,
but that this nicely sey, which is nowhere - like how they only mention
a mouse? its large size, it could just as well as a mountain mouse
Bergbär read this Marmotte Marquise has a large , round head, nose and
lips like a bunny, hair and mouth like a badger, uncovered teeth
like a beaver, a mustache like a cat, eyes like a dormouse, paws
like a bear, a short tail and Clipped ears. If she does nicely, so
it growls like a dog. What is nice here? jumbled and her dancing is
her from the Savoyarde with eingequält hunger and beatings, and sleep,
as from October through to April, so you have time, however, something
nice to dream. " Those who I mentioned in the procession and so much
umherschauen seen chatting among themselves, were the delegates of some
strange and foreign Mäusegeschlechtern and species, which is located
here at the court, conclude alliances, and congratulations abzustatten
experience mitzutheilen, such as cats, owls, vultures and other enemies
of mice to escape sey, even theilten warnings before they are laid
poison and antidote and news of newly-invented with mouse traps.

One of these professional people, the Princess Sissi especially
liked, he was with a ship on the lake very far away from the West come
to high and highest wohlthätigen purposes Collekte to make, he
had the shape of a large rat, wore a black tailcoat and white under
clothes. He was called Mr. Piloris, Sissi, and claimed that he had
through his musky smell, the whole procession was built and very
wohlthätig on its knitted weak nerves. The other delegates were
of the Spitz mice, mice, mountain, forest mice, mice, roots, etc. They
chatted in the church and the procession of the rescue of Princess
Sissi and especially by the execution of the cat Schurrimurri and
their boys, but all expressed great concern about a rumor
circulating that the five sons of the daring Schurrimurri of execution
by consent with the sons of the executioner Seyn and escaped under the
name of the young cats elbow a very dangerous conspiracy, allegedly
to revenge her mother, should have received their intention but
actually sey against the noble mouse sex against chickens and birds,
the owls seyen already won for them, as well as the fox, with the
scurry acted under them, it would be very on his hat Seyn etc. -
Sissy told me about this talk of the excellent state mice with large
Bangigkeit; - o how glad I was able to assure her, although that
rumor founded sey still nothing from these conspirators to fear.

Sissy told me even the content of the speech, which the noble Hofredner
Muskulus held in the Dome. He talked about man and mouse, and Mausheit
mankind, humanity and Mäuslichkeit, human possibility and opportunity
mice. He mentioned the brain of mice, each of which sites the best
dining Theil election; their Großmuth, because despite their Blödigkeit
before all animals a very big heart, and their gratitude, as
the lion from the free networks, their Heldenmuth because The Elephant
is afraid, they want him in the trunk hatch, their prophetic
spirit, because they leave a house before it collapses. He spoke of
the reverence of Ratzer against their parents, who, when they are
old, the boys fed. He mentioned the great love of the mice, which, if
fallen into a pit is to each other in the tail biting, a chain to her
accident Apart from the mouse to drag mine. He said that as thöricht
all these great features the fable sey: a mountain had to give birth,
and a ridiculous mouse sey hervorgekommen, he led the mice as a tool
of God in the Egyptian plagues, and the geitzigen Hatto of Mainz
in which they eaten, although he is on the middle mouse Thurm fled
into the Rhine. He also spoke of the animosity of the mice hold that
even people like their children: "little mouse, my dear little mouse,"
call. He mentioned that the mice except the finest heard the
donkeys have.

But also from the mice Uebermuth said the noble Muskulus, he said, when
the mouse is tired, her flour tastes bitter. He spoke of dangerous
times and that the mice which herumtanzten on the table when the cat
is not at home sey, is not so mausig, but should bear in mind that
the cat, the mouse does not leave. Then he had begged the blessing
of heaven to the noble project Mandelbiß the princess and the prince
Speckelfleck down and invited them to the proverb well to ponder: "To
regret is the mouse, they know only a hole in the house, but to ruin
rennt Those who do not know, "and now sat the learned Muskulus
added, as he in his studies half a library durchfressen and
how splendid it finally the beautiful place of the pagan comedy writer
Plautus've tasted:" Remember 'the wisdom of the little mouse, you
has a lot of doors in her house, you are banning her a hiding to
flee to another, and it sits in Ruh '. "When the bell bags in the
cathedral herumgieng, gave the noble Muskulus still a touching
interpretation of the profound word:" he is so poor as a church mouse,
"which the entire ring bag with Waitz filled grains so plentiful that
the Marquise Marmotte enough to thun had to drag him around, although
the fragrant Mr. Piloris her arm was. Sun Princess Sissi told me
everything that I knew just as good as when I mentioned in the
speech of the noble Muskulus geschlafen .-- I would have thanked her
warmly and said to her: "Dearest Sissy, I am happy that our hearts
and have found that we call you -- oh so do I and all my sufferings
in thy bosom pour out sister, oh I need you to my great shame to
admit, it's me so eagerly to's heart, I long for an object that
I could have freßlieb, it is so empty so empty, I would
devour everything, I would have to me very wrong, or I have a very
heinous hunger, since I tasted the rice Birkenwerder, I have nothing
to put on my heart, as some forest strawberries, Sissi, I create
something schnabelieren to, or I die of longing. "- As erwiederte Sissi:"
Heart Gackeleia!

you've still half a pretzel and a half boys' legs in your basket, "but
I replied:" The documents are, and I wanted to die rather , as documents
are eating. "" Well, "said Sissy," I will see what I can thee rise,
"because she whistled a few times what a bat to her heranflog
which they gave the order: the mouse purest school children should
immediately berries pluck green leaves and I lay at your feet - just as
they should present the financial institution of hazel mice, the
fragrant Muscardin Chevalier in her name to a serving Haselnüße ask and
obtain hieher, ever let them everything they could perform human
Eßwaaren without great attention to, as quickly as possible
herbeischaffen. - Die Fledermaus compliment made her unterthäniges
and flew away .-- Even after a few minutes I noticed a large
Thätigkeit: the mice pulled an old, round genagtes eardrum on the
lawn in my vicinity, and covered several large mushrooms that look
like small tables umherstanden, with leaves and wore it all together
Eßwaaren.

Well, I spoke to Sissi: "Hear me, you're prudent and wise to what
I say to you is true, what I ask, you must thun, otherwise it all
Seyde lost, attention must be avoided to prevent the horrors
unnöthiger shy people confused.

Look where the little powder tonne and erected with stones occupied:
Mack, Benack, Gog, Magog and demagogue, the five ringleaders of the
young cats elbow, which is in a wig along its claws on a Todtenkopf
to your downfall gewetzt have been identified by me including caught,
I have their box and covered the powder conspiracy, the bung hole
of hell, blocked.

Go the same with your husband, Prince Speckelfleck, to your royal father
Mausolus VIII, show it to him and tell him that he should quickly
order that all the mice and the mice without exception Friend clay,
earth and turf to the Fasse hintragen and it around so surrounded, until
it is a pyramid will be reinforced.

To be included they are even and you will rip you by your pious prayers
rescued finding .-- The people should be said, sey the whole a
monument in memory of my presence and your rescue and hot
Gackeleioeum, a counterpart to the mausoleum. It is only his people,
but not a bricklayer to work, because the inside is likely only one
cry: "Mack," and the answer out: "Benack," Everything would be so
verrathen .-- hurry, there is no time to lose , the construction
must be completed Seyn if I promised your father the patriotic send
back works, what with the inauguration of the festival can glorify.

Make your report short and quickly come back with Prince Speckelfleck,
so we continued to travel incognito. "I admired the Gemüthsfassung
the magnanimous Princess Sissi: A look of horror against the powder
tonne, a look of thanks to me, a glimpse of hope against the sky was
everything they erwiederte, and immediately ran it in the biggest
hurry to the Royal Käsepallast up. The hunger awakened me now, I am
approached by the mice gathered meal as I found on the eardrum a
small melon, which the Marquise Marmotte herangewälzt even had the
Chevalier Muskardin had not only half of the hundred most beautiful
Haselnüße eigenmaulig heraufgetragen, but also aufgeknackt; school
youth had a bunch of strawberries and blueberries herbeigetragen and
Nußschaalen very good served a bacon mouse had a huge air and done
me a whole boys' legs fresh from a bakery and a sausage from one of
Gelnhausen Fleischerrauchfang brought, thanks to the noble, upright,
German hearts! to him all the noble efforts of so very respected family
mausoleums of the adage true: "the merits of his crown." Alas! ! how
touching it was, as now, a gemüthvoller young hedgehogs from the
most beautiful attitude rasselte up to me, as a whole RESCUE, he was
in a neighboring city under the Borstorfer Aepfelbäumen gewälzt and
all the fallen apples on his spikes aufgespießt the I am grateful
herabnahm him what he recommended in silence. He was a little melancholy,
because he was misunderstood, his family belongs to the enemies of
the mice, but he had his nature conquered and lived in solitary viewing
as a philosophical and mice Wohlthäter friend among them by the
beautiful heart full of wit princess Sissi estimated. I ate now
in the twilight (because the moon was down and it dawned on the east)
without much choice, what I came under the fingers, funny inside,
Everything, Everything tasted delicious - there was only o the best!
- oh it rustled something next to me and it rolled a little in
my apron, I felt it was an egg, I thought it curious the first
rays of the day opposite - it was black with a beautiful painted forget,
there were around the words: "Vivat Gackeleia," I shook it, oh it
is rasselte money, like a thunderbolt through my mind: it is the egg
of my love Kronovus that it for me every week with his back
pocket to hide the duck Pfuhl wanted! My joy was unspeakable - but who
is the wohlthätige mortals, to me the highest pleasure? I thought
and jumped up and exclaimed: "O my secret Wohlthäter deprive thee my
thanks not," but I heard it far away rush and wundersüßer a musky
odor penetrated me. Since it was clear to me and I cried after him:
"Thou art noble Piloris it, fernher pilgrim Menschenwohlbezwecker in
a black tailcoat and white under clothes, the fragrance of your
beautiful acts verräth you!" "Yes, dear parents , "broke Gackeleia
here," I did not mistake me, this noble musk rat Piloris it had been.
Sissi, I from the egg of Kronovus told, had he been in the church
zugeflüstert what great joy it would make if they are against my
Wohlthaten they could reward this EIE. Piloris, such high interest, he
also participated in the speech of the noble Muskulus had immediately
left the cathedral and went, without a look around, after the eggs to
the castle and brought Pfuhl duck egg so that his words Kronovus
faithfully with 1 Gulden 30 Kreuzer complains there had hidden. "Gockel
Hinkel and saw the egg with great emotion that the two mice were
herbeigelaufen and danced quite merrily, as they gave their applause.

Mademoiselle de
Verneuil was compelled to mingle with this detachment, which was on
its way, like herself, to Saint-James, and would naturally protect her
from all danger as soon as Galope-Chopine informed them that the Gars
glove was in her possession, provided always that the abbe did not see
her.

Towards sunset the three travellers arrived safely at Saint-James, a
little town which owes its name to the English, by whom it was built
in the fourteenth century, during their occupation of Brittany. Before
entering it Mademoiselle de Verneuil was witness of a strange scene of
this strange war, to which, however, she gave little attention; she
feared to be recognized by some of her enemies, and this dread
hastened her steps. Five or six thousand peasants were camping in a
field. Their clothing was not in any degree warlike; in fact, this
tumultuous assembly resembled that of a great fair. Some attention was
needed to even observe that these Bretons were armed, for their
goatskins were so made as to hide their guns, and the weapons that
were chiefly visible were the scythes with which some of the men had
armed themselves while awaiting the distribution of muskets. Some were
eating and drinking, others were fighting and quarrelling in loud
tones, but the greater part were sleeping on the ground. An officer in
a red uniform attracted Mademoiselle de Verneuil's attention, and she
supposed him to belong to the English service. At a little distance
two other officers seemed to be trying to teach a few Chouans, more
intelligent than the rest, to handle two cannon, which apparently
formed the whole artillery of the royalist army. Shouts hailed the
coming of the gars of Marignay, who were recognized by their banner.
Fortunata then standing before him said: "Because we all know, huh? I
called _Mauricia the Dura_. Do not you remember having seen in the Paca
house?. "" Ah ... Fortunata !...» said yes, and loading on the right
foot, threw the other way by rubbing the floor with Amazonian strength.
Mauricia Dura represented the thirty years or more, and his face was
familiar to anyone who understands some iconography historical,
as it was the same, exactly the same as before it was Napoleon
Bonaparte First Consul. That woman unique, beautiful and manly had short
hair and wore long hair and bad worst subject. When shaken a lot of
work, the hair is released, reaching the shoulders, and then the
similarities with the early leader of Egypt and Italy was perfect.
Mauricia not inspire sympathy to all who saw, but which once seen,
not felt the desire to forget and look again.

Because unspeakable fascination exerted by the observer on those
lines and prominent eyebrows, large eyes and feverish, hiding in
ambush under the frontal concavity, the pupil concerned and anxious,
long bone in the cheeks, little meat on the cheeks, strong jaw,
Roman nose, mouth, ending in sharp bends strong and the word, in
short, dreamy and melancholic.

But as he spoke Mauricia Goodbye illusion. His voice was angry,
more men than women, and their language vulgarísimo, revealing a
disorderly nature, with alternatives of depravity and mysterious
manner. - Ii - After acknowledging that, while a quiet, working
both with the same hard.

Somewhat tired they sat on the floor and then Mauricia, crawling to get
along with her companion, said: "This day ... You know, you acabadita
to leave, he was in the house of Juanito Santa Cruz Paca.

Fortunata the looked terrified. "What day?" Was all he said. - Do not
you remember? The day that you were the day I met you ...
_Paices_ silly.

I linked with the Visitation, which I stole a handkerchief, the
very shameless thief.

We got hand y. .. ¡Ras!

Trinqué you ear and I stayed with the slope in hand, game pulpejo ...
I bring almost half face.

She bit his arm, look ... the signal is still here, but I left
sellaíto an eye ... has not yet opened, and he pulled out a strip
of skin ¡ras!

, from such party, by being here ... to the beard. If we turn away,
if I get you to me by the waist, and Paca to, revient ... creételo.
- I agree in that trifulca - Fortunata said looking at her with
fear. - To me, that makes me me pay.

I do not know if you know to Matilda, that silfidona blonde ... -
I do not know, do not know .-- Well, I came across some chismajos,
because I _hablaba_ then the boy Tellería y. ..

Well, I took a day, throw to the ground, I was walking on it all the
time that gave me the win ... Then I took a Badila and first blow
it open with an eyelet in the head, the size of a hard ... She was
taken to the hospital ... They say that the gap that I saw him sesada
... I gave him good reviews. Well another day, being in the
Model ... you'll see ... aunt told me a very, very pindongona look
that if I do not know what it was and I do not know how much, and the
first slap that alum was rolling on the floor with legs in the
air. Nada, who had to Tie ... So returning to what she said. That day
I had with the Visitation zaragata felt come ... the Superior, and
quickly got up and began to scrub again. The nun looked at the floor,
ladeando face when they look like birds to the ground, and
withdrew. A while later the two returned to hit his repentance thread.
"Will not contribute any more there. I asked then if the Paca had
returned there by the _chico_ Santa Cruz, and I answered: 'Shut up
daughter, said here last night if that's still _plumonía_ ...'. Poor,
does not account for little. Was when the lees, if not the lees ... As
you asked the Feliciana one evening I went to teach the Manila shawls
that I was running, and told me you were going to marry ... and a
chemist, the nephew of Doña Lupe _The Pavos_ ... Oh, girl, as if that
Doña Lupe is the most familiar ... Ask for me. I've sold more jewelry
that I have hair on the head. Ah! Then I did well, but suddenly I
am upset, and I fell so ill in the stomach, which could not happen,
as it was entrarme morsel or drop of water, which seemed to me lit
a fire and my sister Severiana, who lives on the streets of the
Mira River, led me to his house, where I entered some cramps that
I thought espicha, and one night, not seeing what I wanted to calm,
I left estampía, and in the tavern pokes me three glasses of liquor,
meaning, after, after, after, and left and half to the middle of
the street we fell to the ground, and the kids I attach to the
round, then came the peppers and I blew the prevention.

Severiana wanted to take me home again, but then a lady we know that
doña Guillermina ... 've heard the name ...

I got on his mind and brought me to this _establecimiento_. Doña Guillermina
is the one that has thrown them poor, you know, and calls and is doing
a charity palación down there for _los huérfanos_. My sister and I
were raised at home, the big house! Of Mr. Pacheco! Very rich, do
not believe, and my mother was ironing them. That's why we have such a
law Doña Guillermina, that whenever I go I want to rescue, said
that while more is bad I have to help me. Well not that I wanted, I
was put here ... I had gotten before, but I was not more than a
week, because I escaped subiéndome by the garden wall, like a cat.
"This story, told with sincerity so frightening, very impressed with
the other _filomena_. Both continued dancing throughout the room,
and sliding on the polished floor, as the skaters on the ice, and
Fortunato, who was scratching on the inside what she said about the
Dura Mauricia wanted to clarify one important point , saying: "I
was not more than twice the Paca House, and my taste has not been any.
The need, the daughter ...

After no more because I went out with the guy with whom I am going to
marry. "After a pause, during which viniéronle thought much past,
thought it appropriate to say something, according to the ideas that
imposing the house:" And to me what I was looking for this man ... Why?
To get lost again.

With just one. "- The men are very unpredictable - said in the tone
of philosophy Mauricia Dura - and when to have one at your disposal,
you have no case more than a piece of old, but if one speaks with
another, and wants up against the back, by that of another delicacy
that is. Well ... if I put an example to be honest, not very combs
through that, and if he puts a lot of praying and confession and
communion, they were turned over to them Querencia, dags and by us
from so that we become the church ...

So what, you think Juanito is not coming to hang from the convent
who knows you're here?

_Paices_ Boba. Tenlo indeed, and one of the cars that are out there,
trust us that it is yours. - Do not be silly ... donkeys do not
say - said the other pale -.

Can not be ... Look you, he fell with pneumonia in February ... -
Well you know .-- I know by Feliciano, who is counted, _días atrás_,
a man who is a friend of Villalonga.

Well you see, he fell with pneumonia in February, and in this _entremedio_
I met the boy with whom I speak ... The other two months were very
malito ... if you go when not. At last came out in March and went to
Valencia with his wife. - And what - still not be returned. - _Paices_
boba ... This is a mean. And if you did not come back, come back ...

This means that the wheel when you will come and learn that you now
for a saint. - You ... yes you are silly leave me alone. And
if I come round ... To me, what? Sister Natividad considered broaching
and saw "that it was good." Artist appreciation resplendent in his
face dry.

He looked at the ceiling trying to find some speck caused by flies,
but there was nothing, and even the heads of the nails in the wall,
cleaned the day before, resplendent as gold stars.

The Superior glasses back around looking for something to scold,
but found nothing worthy of strong criticism.

Provided that before entering the furniture clean and rub well to stay
out all the dust, but instructed that this operation is much _al
hilo_ made of wood, and the two workers are not well understood
what this meant, it took a cloth and they almost made it with the
utmost seriousness about your system.

When they were alone again, Mauricia told her friend: "Be happy for
this _tía chiflada_, which is a good person, and as you rub the
furniture _al hilo_, got a starting gear.

Mauricia had days. The nuns considered lunatic, because most
often the subject easy to obedience, making it work, as a coup entrábale
madness and broke to say and do the greatest unreasonable. The first
time this has happened, the nuns were alarmed, but not tamed
the fury that was necessary to appeal to force, when repeated accesses
procacidad and indiscipline gave them no great importance. It was an
impressive spectacle, and even fun from time to time, usually every
fifteen or twenty days, Mauricia given to all staff in the convent.
The first time I witnessed Fortunata felt real terror. Iniciábasele
disorder that Mauritius as diseases begin with mild symptoms, but
infallible, which are accentuated and then walk around the morbid
process. The prodromal period is often an issue with any collection
chocolate breakfast or if you encountered when you leave and the other
did so with malicious intent. The mothers involved, Mauricia and
silent at the end, staying for two or three hours sullen, rebellious
to treatment, instead of doing everything as it is sent.

His diligence in trocábase appalling laziness, and as mothers reprimanded,
not answered them all face to face, but back in the back, left to
hear grunting, chewing including crude words.

In this period it remained a common and noisy carnival mischief done
to provoke unexpected laughter from some and outrage _Filomenas_
ladies. Mauricia took the silence of the room to start work in it
a cat with a chocolate tied to the tail, or make any other kids more
of nonsense than women formal. Sister Antonia, who was kindness itself,
Mirabal with all the severity that might be angelic in nature, and
Mauritius will look back with hardness insolent, saying: "If I have
not been _yio_ ...

_amos_, if I have not been _yio_ ... What I watch tantooo ... Do they
want me retrataaar ...?». that day, Sister Antonia called the Superior,
who was a very warm Biscay. This he said to come: "Are you loose the
enemy again ?...». And that was ordered locked in the room that served
as a prison where some collection insubordination. Here was the start
of the fierceness of that evil woman. 'Shutting me ...

How veee ... ras?

I tell you ... garment. - Mauritius - said the nun with manly
fortitude, releasing an expression of their land - anything you
_chínchirri-máncharras_, and obey. You know that does not scare us
with their botaratadas. Here we are not afraid any Tarascan. Compassion
and charity not to miss the street, and you know ... Come on, girl,
short and do what is told. Mauricia A jaw was trembling and his eyes
took the opacity of the left eyes of the cats when they are attacking.
The collections looked scared, and some nuns surrounded the Superior
to make it comply. "Go with what comes out now ... crazy aunt Shutting
my ¡! Where I was at my house, ¡hala ...!, my house, where I took
these indecentonas fooled, yes sir, cheated, because I was honored
as a sun, and here we show that combs and combs ... Ha ha ha! ...
Go with the ladies, and virtuous _santifiquísimas_. Ha ha ha !...».
These guttural monosyllables the broadcast with the bulk of their
gruesísima voice, accent and with such infamous sarcasm and rudeness,
which would have drawn people to tolerate less patience and phlegm
that Sister Natividad and their partners. Were so made to be treated
that way and had tamed beasts so shocking, that injury did not end.

"Come on - said the Superior frown -; silent, and get you into the
courtyard." - Well, I like the sanctity of the church traviatonas
...

Ha ha ha !...-- yelled the infamous put in jars and looking round at all
the competition out of -. Click here to romp shut at ease with
curánganos of bib ... Ha ha ha! ... What hair! ... and the non-bib.
tapaban Many ears were collected. Others hold the hand on the chassis,
the nuns looked stunned and his serenity. At that moment the room
appeared a strange figure. Sor Marcela was an old nun, and take almost
dwarf the most wretched picture of woman you can imagine. His face,
which seemed to cardboard, it was dark, hard, flat, Mongolian type,
expressive eyes and affable as some of the breed cattle quadrupeds.
His body was shaped like a woman, and seemed to unravel and go walk
on the left side, printing on the dry land a blow that was not
known if he was standing pole or the stump of the broken bone.

His ugliness was matched only by the impavidez compassionate and disdain
with which he looked to Mauritius. Sor Marcela brought in the
right hand a large key, and pointing it to the sternum of the offender,
he castañeteo language and said no more than this: 'Come on'. Quitose
the beast with his fast-moving plays, and shook the long hair went
to the corridor, drawing on that terrible mouth insolence.

The re-take the lead, and Mauritius, moving his arms like windmill blades,
was shouting: 'Combs and combs!

... ¿Well, I do not want to dishonor and enclosing as if I were
a _criminala_? ¡Tunantas!

... when if I wanted, the graves of three blows to its head ...». Despite
such ferocity, the take had to go with the same calm that is conducive
to a dog that barks a lot, but who knows not to bite.

In the middle of the staircase became the harpy, with swollen eyes and
watching the nuns who were in the corridor, I said in a shrill scream:
"Thieves, thieves, rather than!

... ¡Enormous barbed !...». That said, take him gently placed his
hand on the back, pushing forward. In the courtyard had to pick
it up by one arm, because I wanted to rise again. "If you do not case,
stupid - you said - if you are not talking to the devil, but you go
in your mouth.

Shut up for the love of God and not marees more. "- The devil you -
said the beast, and it seemed, so much exalted, irresponsible
nonsense of saying -.

Fach, mamarracho, Esperpentos ... - Echa, misses more poison - Sor
Marcela grumbled quietly, opening the door of the prison -. So the
sooner you go arrechucho. Go inside, and am like a glove. At night
you get to eat. Patience, child ... Mauricia barked a little more,
but with so much fury of words was no real resistance, so that
drove the poor old invalid as a child.

Enough that the cogiese by an arm and tuck inside the enclosure, so that
the prison is made without any problem, after much fuss. Sor Marcela
threw two rounds giving the key and saved it in your pocket. Her face,
a mask very similar to Japanese, was imperturbable. While crossing the
yard toward the stairs, heard the _ja ja ja_ Mauritius, who was leaning
on one of the two skylights with iron bars that had the door
at the top. The nun did not stop to hear the insults which he said
the beast. "Hey! ... Take ... Galapagos back here and see what I give
you ... Morrazo What a look!

Cañamón, leg and half ...». - iii - The Napoleonic face, livid and
with loose hair again appear in the grid to sunset.

And Sor Marcela passed repeatedly in front of the jail, returning
to record nesting hens, to see if they were eggs, water or that the
thoughts and francesillas cultivated in a corner of the garden.

The courtyard, which was small and communicated with the garden by
a fence of wood is almost always open, was very badly paved, it is
just as irregular step of the lame, the balancing of the body looked
like a small boat in a sea very agitated.

Very often he Sor Marcela there as it had the key to Leñera and
coal, the dungeon and the other piece of junk that kept the house
and the church.

Now near the night, as I said, Mauritius does not remove the grate to
talk to the nun when passing. His accent had lost the harshness of
angry in the morning, although he was hoarse and had more shades
of pain and misery, begging for charity. The beast was tamed. Strong
grabbed with both hands to the irons, his face glued to them, extending
the mouth to be better heard, with voice plañidera said: "Cojita
mine ... cañamoncito my soul, how much I love you!

... There goes the duck wag their, one, two, three ... Lucero of the
convent, see and listen, you want to say one thing. These expressions
of tenderness, a mixture of affectionate mockery, the nun did
not even with a glance. And still another: "Alas, my galapaguito
my soul, what is enfadadito me, I would like both! ... Sor Marcela, a
word, just a word. I do not want me getting here, because I deserve
the encerrona. But oh my little girl if I saw that bad since! _Paice_
My stomach is starting the fire with pliers ...

Is the tremolina this morning. I get tempted to hang himself hanging
from the railing with a rope made of strips refajo. And what I do,
yes, I do and I do not hang if you look and you tell me something
... Cojita funny, Dwarf remonona, look, listen: if you want to
want more than my life and you obey like a dog, do me a favor I
am going to ask, bring me nothing but a lagrimita of that divine glory
which you have in what the doctor prescribed you for your bad belly
...

Come on, angel, look what I ask you with all my heart, because this
penit I have not been here I want to remove, and it seems that I
am going to die.

Come on, rich cañamón of angels, get me what I ask, and God give you
life in heaven that you have won, and three more, and I crown you
the seraphim in heaven when you enter your patita take ... " . ...
The nun went Trun, Trun ... injuring the pebbles with one foot
as hard to be a chair leg, and not attached to the prisoner or
response or eyes.

By nightfall, fell to the dinner for the dam, opening the door and
entered the dark chamber. Did not see a prompt to Mauritius, which
was nestled on a table, her knees beside the chest, hands crossed
on his knees, and hands supported the beard. "I see. Where are you?
"Muttered take the pile sitting on another table.

Mauricia answered with a growl like a mastiff who are a foot to wake.
Sor Marcela placed next to it a plate of bread and a mixed. "The
Superior - said - not that you wanted to bring more than bread and
water, but interceded for you ...

No te lo mereces. Although I have no guts to propose, I can get.
You were handling me in my worst and I know that while you are
concerned, the more rabid you put ... And you see, daughter, took
up where my condescension ... "added under the cloak of removing an
object ... Mauricia thought he had smelled, because suddenly he raised
his head, and life become so animated that his face seemed
_mismamente_ when the other, noting the pyramids, said the _cuarenta
siglos_.

The dungeon was dark, but through the door came the last days of
clarity, and the two women locked up there and you could see they were,
but rather as people as packages.

Mauricia stretched his hands forward to touch the bottle, saying
balbucientes and truncated words to express his gratitude, but the
nun away the coveted object.

"Hey! ... hands quiet. If we do not have formality, I'm leaving.
You see I am not Tirana, which led the charity to a limit that
might be unwise. But I say: 'Giving a little, just a miajita, the
comfort, and here there is no vice. " Because I know what is the
weakness of the stomach and how much you suffer.

Deny and deny the prisoner guilty always asking what is not good. The
Lord can not deny this. Console to have mercy and sad. "
The enemies were in presence of each other.

"This is really magic, mademoiselle," said Madame du Gua; "there is no
one like you for surprises. Have you come all alone?"

"All alone," replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "So you have only one
to kill to-night, madame."

"Be merciful," said Madame du Gua. "I cannot express to you the
pleasure I have in seeing you again. I have truly been overwhelmed by
the remembrance of the wrongs I have done you, and am most anxious for
an occasion to repair them."

"As for those wrongs, madame, I readily pardon those you did to me,
but my heart bleeds for the Blues whom you murdered. However, I excuse
all, in return for the service you have done me."

Madame du Gua lost countenance as she felt her hand pressed by her
beautiful rival with insulting courtesy. The marquis had hitherto
stood motionless, but he now seized the arm of the count.

"You have shamefully misled me," he said; "you have compromised my
honor. I am not a Geronte of comedy, and I shall have your life or you
will have mine."

"Marquis," said the count, haughtily, "I am ready to give you all the
explanations you desire."

They passed into the next room. The witnesses of this scene, even
those least initiated into the secret, began to understand its nature,
so that when the musicians gave the signal for the dancing to begin no
one moved.

For Gockel arrival was the people in a wide circle gathered under
the tree on which the royal court musicians and the city of
Gelnhausen piper played a beautiful dance, namely the egg dance,
which the royal family with Raugräflichen in his own person most
wanted to dance.

On a carpet delicious hundreds of gilded peacock eggs, always ten
o'clock-ten o'clock, laid in rows. Then came the queen Eilegia Gockel
and connected to his eyes with a silk handkerchief, and he that
it the same, just as the king joined Eifrasius Hinkel and wife, and
the prince Kronovus and Gackeleia the eyes and were now on the
Hofmarschällen Eggs led carpet on which they are compatible with
the delicate steps, jumps and turns between the eggs were dancing,
without even one with the feet touching.

The audience watched with tense attention quite silent, and marveled
at the amazing agility of the high lords.

But not far away in bushes were a few old men who had no joy in
the dance and looked with eyes unabgewendeten after the footpaths,
which consists of herlief the city, whether its companion, the third,
will not soon come, and before they versahen, he stood among them.

"Did you, did you?" she screamed Neuangekommenen the opposite
and made it pointed fingers like claws firmly against his closed
fist, and he erwiederte: "Yes I have happy with the ring's dolls
Gackeleia addiction caught, I gave it a very similar with a false
green glass stone, where, at what now Gockel fingers.

Now we can take revenge on him, that he gave us at the Hahn
purchase and cheated us into the wolf pit has dropped, we would
have starved miserably when our farmers were not removed. "So said
the three old Oriental Petschierstecher, Gockel had the wish
to cite, and which he had led. They had but through their list into
the possession of the ring and wanted to put its miracle right now
force attempt.

They took all three to the ring and spoke at the same time, the
words "thou wise King Solomon, the ghosts unterthänig, Mach 'Gockel
again the old, Zumpig, paltry, mißgestalt, Mach' Mrs.

Hinkel re ugly, quarrelsome, ränkisch, Grouches, awful, Mach 'Gackeleia

money, and lock Ross and yard and field, Jag' bang it again and
fall in the old chicken coop.

Petschaftstechern But us three, Construction 'a house with golden
roofs, make us Hofagenten, Hoffactoren, Consul ducks, knights and
Kommerzienräthen, Commissären and prophets.

Make us happy very formidable religious gieb and uniform! ring, ring
spinning 'to you, Make it beautiful, we ask drum. While they are at
the ring turned, grumbling was loud and laughing and bitching at the
people gathered. "Ah, you see the old beggar, the old dirty beggar,
dirty cheeky child, no, this is outrageous, chasing them away,
Pratscher, Pratscher, how they crush the eggs!" - and soon became
the crowd yelling and so general, Eifrasius that the king and queen
and the prince Eilegia their Kronovus bandages from his eyes tearing,
and how amazed they are not as they Raugrafen Gockel Hinkel and
wife and Miss Gackeleia, previously so beautiful and young, beautifully
dressed and had been in an old, ugly, torn beggar transforms family saw
what all the eggs on the delicious carpet had trod; reluctant
yelling at her now also tore these unfortunate the binding of the
eyes, and fiengen to bitterly to weep and to complain about their
transformed condition, because they hardly recognized again.

Gockel reached for his Ring Salomonis and turned, but mistook the
wrong ring could not, because he saw the ring and realized that
he was exchanged, and cried out loud: "alas me ! I'm lost, I'm around
the ring betrayed! "He just wanted Eifrasius the king's feet,
and his misfortune complain, but this pushed him back, drew his sword
and a vow was made, what his aide him in any the case back, perennirenden
command had, so he is not the Alleräußerste Thue. Eilegia The Queen was
so horrified that they chortle and Schluchsen in nerve-Zuund circumstances
and into the arms of the upper - and lower-Eiermarschallin
powerless fell.

Gockel Hinkel and Theil which these phenomena from past experience
and some from the annals of suffering humanity knew, was attended
by the legs on his shoulders and ran them, the more and faster, but
as members of the k.

Hofkapelle amazing performance, with eggs by throwing them where
they are brought to a position where they are from the civil
hochlöblichen Gelnhausen sniper Compagnie patriotic support after
the watchful Stadthürmer to Hülfe had blown.

The hopeful Prince Chen Kronovus alone statuirte again an example of his
steadfast character.

As the parents Gackeleia old, ugly and verlumpt flee and even looked
dirty and torn, she cried, weeping: "Kronovus oh, oh how I am so
dirty and become wa wa!

Who has made me so dirty?" since passed her with a beautiful version
Kronovus his handkerchief with the words: "as you wipe Gackeleia
beautiful and clean out the nasal sound, so - so that's good, because
you have your basket, I dance dirs repealed. "- then he threw her
another Thaler in the apron -" because you have my pocket money.

Saturday evenings at the rear of the duck Pfuhl, forget where are
thou shalt always find an egg, Vivat Gackeleia what is and what
is my pocket money that get!

"- then pulled out a pretzel and said," pull "- as they moved, and
each one tore a piece of it - and a boys' legs and said," tear!

" each and tore half of them, then he said: "Each of us retains its
Theilmann, and if we see again and each brings its Theil again, and
the pieces still fit together nicely, we are quite brave, loyal
playmates been and I swear to you, like me, at the grave of the old
Urgockels of which thou hast erzählet that we always want to stay
together "- because they both raised their hands and swore .--
Gackeleia wept in the solemn moments and wanted to hug Kronovus
because Gockel cried: "Gackeleia tummle thee quickly, Vogt ways;
the point of begging!"

- what Kronovus this zurief: "think he is back, master prankster, I will
of course continue Comteßchen"; moments came in the same but an aide
of Eifrasius, Chen urged the prince's sword and led him away to
the royal-Ofenloch Oberhof.

Kronovus but even before that, said the beggar Vogt: "that he is not it,
my dear Spielkamerädin the Comteßchen touch!"

gave her hand and said, "suffer patiently, but now run what you can!"
da ran Gackeleia what giebst thou, what hast thou? with her parents
after her basket, and the beggar Vogt accompanied the unfortunate
family, more to spread it with his umbrella against the rain of eggs
to protect, which the naughty boys on streets they cast, as that he
had driven her away.

On the Eiercirkus was great confusion occurred; Eifrasius the
king was too much except that the queen Eilegia too much to come
inside.

Eifrasius had drawn his sword, he wanted the Gockel to life, he
strampelte with all four feet, as he all but the highest family
ausstieß oath: "into force sixty destillirter Eierschnäpse, I eat
the guy on a Butterbrod!"

so took it to the commander of the bodyguard of the poor and the
Garde-Obrist Dwarf Corps gave him a leg up until the first Courage
beruhiget and Außersichkeit again came to the house.

The Queen Eilegia demanded even greater effort to make them out of their
inwardness again to bring to light, it was in itself, as in a deep
draw, before hinabgestürzt horrors.

The nerve to know what the golden bucket hangs in the soul of man
sitting at Eilegia were of great tenderness and delicacy that
horror before they tore the lofty soul, and with the golden bucket
sammt deep, deep, deep into her schönes Gemüth down plumps'te.

Eilegia was a loud cry: "horreur! Bettelbagage what!" the Oberhof-Eiermarschallin
fainted into the arms have fallen. Only the united efforts of the
Academy of Sciences for rescuing injured, which once held an
extraordinary meeting, it succeeded, the Deep Theurer back again, the
secret chamber Schnürdame schnürte on to their lofty Gemüthe more air
to enter, so for his whole Oberhof glowing Easter Haas astutely presented
soon in a short a fresh Osterei with the inscription: "Eilegia Vivat!",
which was painted the powerless, and the best for the suffering
humanity is always on the go standing body surgeon and Aderlaßschnepper
called the soul of the edeln , loving, intimate Eilegia by one, with
just as much flavor as the impact, with just as much grace as
Precision's blood back dismissal from the inner depths of her
beautiful Gemüthes on her noble face back - oh - and her first nice
tuna was their beloved anzulächeln Gelnhausen.

The orchestra played a patriotic Dankgallopade under which Eifrasius
and Eilegia in two Portchaisen eggs sitting in the castle zurückwalzten
to completely recover, but Prince had Kronovus the night in
Oberhof-Ofenloch at Bisquit-cake and sweet wine a strict arrest
endure.

Everything People moved to Gelnhausen noisily back to Gockel palace
looting and the ground to do the same, but they went on so often
in the Wirth houses, that they were in a deep night came on the
market, where they sang the night opposite: "Listen Lord, and let
her tell you, the bell has twelve clock beaten, but that is not
even much against a lock, which disintegrated into dust, has
confessed's long and wide, We live in a wonderful time, the market
is as empty as before The cow is back before the old Thor, look at
her this miracle men went fast as it arose under, Keeps the fire
and the light, that is not the city itself g'schiecht disaster, And
praise the Lord God.

"Really was also the magnificent castle Gockel and all its gardens
and everything that was with man and mouse disappeared on the market
splashes of the old city of fountains, as if he knew nothing.

The good citizens Giengen home after a long time in the empty air
compatriots had, and considered where they comply with all their cakes
and roasts should be out because of the large court Gockel no longer
buy from them would be good .-- The Gelnhausen but could but not much
sleep, because the mayor had the eggs on the castle to City Hall
or Rathaus a long series of night watchmen determining which narrowed
zubliesen how Eifrasius and Eilegia though is what the physician every
quarter of an hour at the palace guard had reported and what the night
watchman in the whole city whispers again, including the countless
butchers dogs howled and barked and cocks crowed all.

It was an unprecedented hard, theilnahmvolle, sleepless, patriotic
night for Gelnhausen.

Scarcely had the people sleeping caps on, when suddenly all the night
watchman at the shop windows and knocked exclaiming: "Patriotic
Gelnhausen jubilire, your window like all 'illuminire, urban butchers

almost hoarse, well yesterday indeed a hot day.

Kronovus Prince in Oberhof-Ofenloch is quite well and still singing
blithely: "Gackeleia, Gackeleia my favorite," When we are together

A solid recovery in the quietest Eifrasii Silence Is allerweisester

The good people were so tired and sleepy that they could calm this
patriotism, and quite Gelnhausen in the deep snoring of eggs Burger
einstimmte .-- On the market the next day the price of eggs rose
by 3 and 7 / 87 Procent.

The poor Gockel, Hinkel, the poor woman, the poor Gackeleia moved
again as formerly by the wild forest to the old castle, but they
were much sadder and spoke not a word, yes Mrs.

Hinkel had even the apron hanging over the head because they are ashamed
to have become so ugly Seyn. When they arrived at a level were, where
you Gelnhausen again could see Gockel turned around and said, "'s
unhappy place where I order the delicious Salomonis ring was betrayed;
vile, ungrateful Eifrasius how shameful you have me in my misfortune;
and did not think me a hundred new pieces Gockeld'ors again to give
the happier you are in time borrowed from me. " Ms.

Hinkel but exclaimed: "o Eilegia Queen! how many American Indian Vogelnik

that we have lost the ring and become poor, you ungrateful causest

"- Well Gackeleia also raised her voice and said," Oh, you dear

your gift Thaler and your handkerchief enough that I could wipe,
you want me all your pocket money on Saturday when the Ducks Pfuhl

went on the poor, dirty Gackeleia not from you weggestoßen.

Oh, it does me quite sorry that I forget the fear, you beautiful doll
for my memory to give. "Scarcely had the word doll Gackeleia
pronounced than Gockel looked angrily at her and said," thou
unfortunate child! you have a doll? what doll? where you have the doll?
knowest thou not the Urtheil in the neck hochnothpeinlichen court
for the murder Gallina's, that you from now on and never can have
any doll!

- oh, I punish the cause of my perdition! "And this because
it small Gackeleia wanted to take, ran before the angry father after
the outermost edge of a cliff, which is on a steep slope hinausragte.
Hinkel woman screamed: "For God's sake, the child falls to death!"

and held at arms Gockel back.

Gackeleia but knelt on the outermost edge of the rock, spread their
Aermchen against the father and said: "Father forgive Gockel ach
'mother Hinkel steh' at me, Or Gackeleia small jumps and breaks the
neck and leg!"

Then the woman asked the Gockel Hinkel much, he should the child,
forgive, and Gockel said, she should just tell all what they are
employed, it will not kill.

"Gackeleia tell," said the mother, "where you have a doll & financial?"
There was Gackeleia in great fear, because The father woke during
the narration of a birch, which stood at the cliff, and then when
a Zweiglein, and it looked so pretty, almost as if he where not a
broom, but at least a tie Ruthe wanted, but what helped Everything
the child had to speak and said: "To my garden this morning was a
very old man fully concerned Ließ before me in the dance itself

rice from Birch," because we have the clean Bescheerung, a doll,
oh it's heaven screaming!

"Gackeleia but quickly said:" No dummy, it is only a beautiful art

and so on, each has besondre clothes.

"Horrible, disgusting," said Gockel, but Gackeleia went on: "allerliebst

Several superior men took pleasure in developing in me
that liberty of thought and contempt for public opinion which do tear
from a woman her modesty of soul, robbed of which she loses her charm.
But I made it the worst feeling that I know from the horrible state
of war back into the quiet life returns, should not even hope for a
peaceful participation in a company that employed me so much and I
am all over the world deeming useful and interesting. This stirred
once again the old Adam; reckless allegations, paradoxical sentences,
and ironic Meet more like what was produced quickly apprehending and
malaise among friends: Locksmith prohibiting the like is very
fierce, the landlady did not know what they should make us both,
and their placement at least brought that farewell faster than
prefixed, but not hastily appeared. From my stay in Frankfurt,
I knew little to say, neither of my other return, and the end of the
year, the beginning of the following was not a feral atrocities and
also hear siegberauschten nation. But I was a unique change in the
usual way of life before. The Duke of Weimar, occurs after geendigter
Campagne from Prussian service, and the Lament of the regiment was
great through all the stages, they lost leaders, rulers, advisor,
benefactor and father at the same time. I, too, should be closely
linked to excellent men at once distinguished and it was not without
tears of the best. The worship of the only man and officer had brought
us together and kept, and we seemed to lose ourselves, as we his
leadership and a reasonably cheerful dealing with each other should
abdicate. The area around Aschersleben, near the resin, from
there, so easy to get, seemed lost to me, I am also deeply hineingedrungen
never again. And so we want to close, so as not to look at the
world fates to come, we still twelve years threatened to get the
same level of flooding inundates us, where not seen devoured.
The time came when I found myself married to Danton. The whip
whistled through the coachman schweißtriefenden the horses. We had
the fast reach. Unterwegs, I got a heart spasm. When I came back to
me, the car rattled over the pavement Trento, and Heinrichs
angstentstelltes face bent over me. "Will you continue them?" I
nodded. They lifted me into the train. I recovered myself so far as
to be able to think calmly. Sealing Brixen large walnut trees, was
among a small village called Varna, where I wanted to stay until --.
"Until everything is good, my poor darling," he whispered, "if I only
would be safe, that thou thy fear, thy Lord will excitement - for me
is the fight a breeze -" The Triumph of victory flashed already
from his eyes. In Bressanone us were still a few hours to
leave. At the post office was a letter to me from the mother
with a leaflet are adjusted in correspondence: "This anonymous, I
just wipe. I have it, praise God, before Hans hide. Since, however,
repetitions, perhaps directly to him, probably, and I sense from your
decency is still so much hope that the contents of this document
is a libel and Dr. Brandt are not traveling with you, so I ask
you, to make that he gave us his presence in Berlin documented in
some way ... "" Tomorrow will happen, "said Henry," you are
standing, how necessary it is that we bring the victims of
this separation. It will be the last! "With a quiet reproach I saw
him," seems almost as pleased you that you must continue! "I am of
the obstacles facing us in its way. I would become anxious before the
size of my fortune, if not a victim of his property would cost. "I
am ashamed of my grief, and we took leave of each other, almost
as if it was a welcome. * * * * * In the tower room of the inn to Vahrn
moved I am still the same evening. From my window I saw into Schalderer
Valley, with its dark fir trees at the clear stream. For hours I
sat here in wake dreams. Sometimes I followed the silent forest up after
Schalders. But it was a bright day, otherwise I'm afraid, and saw how
once as a child, behind every tree ghosts lurking. At night
after I climbed up and sat Salernes between the old walls of the ruin
to broad mountain valley of the shadow Brixen veiled and distant peaks
of the Dolomites on the horizon as aufglühten extinguishing torches.
The night came the dark thoughts. Then I read again and again his
letters and was looking between the lines, what he wants to hide
from conservation, "Rosalie makes visits to all acquaintances, and I
see the faces of the people, what they are told -" she was looking
for testimony against me ; the cost of divorce would prevent our
marriage to be! "She has recently Egidyschen friends circle" - she was
looking for a connection with parents, they will go to the Father, tell
him - and he ertrüge does not, then do not - Henry before he would
urge the gun! Still nothing happened. In my father's letters were
excited, but only on the events of the day: the sentencing hammer
stone alleged forgery to prison, "a portent for the nobility, whose
young, the golden calf umtanzt and absolutely forfeited to the
dizziness," the withdrawal of the Conservative Stöcker party, "this
brave man, the Social Democrats with their damned style of the
publication of a stolen private letters on the conscience," on the
anniversary in his speeches always clearly emerging world power
lusts of the Emperor, "which we tested by straight ways and the Old
Prussian economy conscious Of Appeal to the ancestral land and its
processing into politics abenteuernder sailors hineinreißt.

"I had my memory, always troublesome to the world than myself, for
when his letters heischten answer.
After thus carrying out her resolution, Marie gave way to grief, and
her face, beautified till then by these conflicting sentiments,
changed for the worse so rapidly that in a single day, during which
she floated incessantly between hope and despair, she lost the glow of
beauty, and the freshness which has its source in the absence of
passion or the ardor of joy. Anxious to ascertain the result of her
mad enterprise, Hulot and Corentin came to see her soon after her
return. God favors me ...

If I had a child I would accompany him, but ... ¡Quia !...».
After this reluctance, which seemed to blunt the daughter of a deep
conviction, he continued watching and admiring their beauty.

I was proud of her black eyes, so beautiful that, under an opinion
of herself, gave the _le stab at Espiritui Santo_. The complexion was
a price for his mate and their purity and transparency newly carved
ivory tone, the mouth, a little big, but so fresh and mona in
laughter or in anger ...

And then some teeth! "I have teeth - said she show - such as bits of
curdled milk." The nose was perfect.

"Noses like mine are few" ... And finally make up the black hair
and abundant as the evil thoughts, said: "Oh a pelites that God
has given me!".

When he was concluding, he came to lie a point, which was not then
for the first time.

Hacíala every day, and it was this: "How much more beautiful now
that I am ... before!

I won a lot. "And then it became very sad. Bits of curdled milk
disappeared under the lips gathered and will be assembled in entrecejo
as a dense cloud.

The beam that was happening inside read: "If I see now ...!». Under
the weight of this consideration was a long time still and silent, the
light force be independently set.

Awoke to what seemed to slumber, and turning to look, animose with its
reflection in the mirror palmito good. "Say what you want, the best
thing I have is the entrecejo ... So when I was pretty upset ...

To see how angry I get when I? Well, well ... Ah, call! ". The campanillazo
the door forced to leave the toilet.

Left open with one hand and comb in the towel by the shoulders. He was
the redeemer, which came very happy and told her she had just hair.

As little as missing, was soon done. Maximilian the praised for his
decision not to take Peinador.

Why women do not have to be combed alone? Which can not learn.
That's Fortunata said. The poor kid did not stop expressing his
admiration for the proper arrangement and economy of their future into
their own hands doing the task poorly performing these thieves who
call Bergant bred to serve.

Fortunata ensures that the custom was not yours merit because
the work he loved.

"You're a alhajita - told his lover with pride -.

As to the hairdressers, all pimps are great, and enter the house where
there can be no peace. "Later take a maid, because she should not
kill to work.

Surely be in good position, and some days you may have invited to your
table. The easement is necessary, and arrive safely in one days might
not be without a babysitter.

On hearing this, little loose laughter Fortunata, but was contained,
and more specifically to say in it: 'Why this hapless babysitters
want ...!». Next, the couple took up the theme of the wedding, and
said such things Fortunata could not pay much mind to the generosity
and nobility of soul. "Your behavior will decide his fate - he said -
and how your behavior has to be good, because your soul has all the
springs, we are at the end of the street. I put the crown on your
head woman honored, because you do not you drop by and take it with
dignity.

The past is past is no repentance and no trace of stain, but no
trace. Tell the world what we value. What is the world? Look good
and you'll see it is nothing if not the conscience. "Fortunata A
moist eye was because it was very accessible to the excitement and when
he spoke with solemnity and a generic sense, but not be moved
understand certain concepts.

Enternecían the tone, style and expression of the eyes. Case of conscience
thought then make a comment to his friend. "Think about what you do
well - he said - and I do not compromise your dignity ...». I meant,
but did not give the word for the rare use that his life was in
fact the words of this nature.

But he gave his mornings to express roughly the idea, saying: "He estimates
that I know you going to call _The husband of Fortunata_, instead
of calling you by your first name.

I thank you so much you do for me, but I feel like I do not want to
see ...». wanted to say a stigma on the forehead, but neither
knew the word or even could have known the words correctly.
"I do not want you take me by the hair, what he said, and was so
fresh, hoping to convince. But Maximilian, in his mind and strong
in his conscience, and within two impregnable bastion, laughed. Similar
arguments were for him as it would be for holders of Gibraltar would
like to see them assaulting an enemy armed with a cane. ¡Valiente if
he was stupid from the ordinary! ... When his conscience told him:
'Look, son, this is the path of good, go for it ", as could the entire
human race come to arrest, and could sign with a lined flue.

Because he was taking a character that had not yet heard the people,
a steel, and all they said was a conversation of their shyness.
'You're good, honest and fair is what matters: the rest are my own, let
me, you let me. "Fortunata Shortly after lunch, and Maximiliano study,
change from time to time a few words. Dominated the entire evening
in the spirit of the young ideas optimistic because he made it say
something about your heritage, and mortgages of lands in Molina de
Aragon, ensuring that _sus vines could give more cuanto_. At night
warned to bring their coffee, and wine waiter of the _The Paz_ him.

Olmedo Feliciana and entered the chat. Monkeys and were hardly spoken,
clear signal from domestic player. And if that is the most
solid when the finances did not break up with perfect regularity,
that house, home, family or whatever, could not suffer the anomalies
of a budget whose deficit was permanent.

Feliciana had already pledged his very best clothes, and Olmedo
lost credit in an absolute manner. For lack of credit is lost
republics as well as monarchies. And there was already good hopes
of Olmedo about the next catastrophe.

His friends, who knew him well, I found it less fortitude to play the
role of the profligate, and often it clear to the good nature through
the mask. Maximiliano A told him that they had caught in the
Retiro Olmedo looking stealthily. When he saw his friends hid the
books from the foliage, because he knew that he discovered that bad
weakness. Attached great importance to the result in human acts,
and was dishonored by the sudden release of the badges and Casaca
perdulario. What the people say, what friends, what brats, younger
than he, who took him by model ?

Hallábase the situation on one of those kids that to be an air of
men lit a cigarette and was very strong start smoking and marean
with him, but trying to control the nausea not to say that have been
drunk. Olmedo could not stand the most horrible dismay, disgust and
I felt dizzy but continued with the cigar in his mouth making him
throw, but no suck thing more. Feliciana, meanwhile, had begun
to camp by their respects . I said, honesty and love were very good
things, but did not eat. The skull of motion was not allowed any
barrabasada that night. Only to enter, and when the four sat
down to have coffee with her usual desenfado said: "Noses, is gathered
here _Demi the toit-Monde_. Fortunata Feliciana and did not understand,
but Rubín became incarnate and was very uncomfortable, because these
words apply to people willing to join in a holy bond seemed disrespect,
rudeness and a pig, yes sir, a pig ... But not to shut up or take
away from the Camorra their reunion tone of circumspection and
formality. Acordose that nothing had said to his friend's wedding
plans, and clearly spoke in terms so Olmedo _liberales_ ignorance.
Determined, therefore, reveal his thinking at the first
opportunity for that in future better measure and weighs his words. -
Viii - That night was also bad for Fortunata, since they spent
most of the thinking, if run on _The otro_ will remember it or not.

He was very particular that would not have ever found on the
street. And for lack of looking good to all sides it was certainly not.
Would it be bad, be out of Madrid?

Later, when he learned that in February and March Juanito Santa Cruz had
been ill with pneumonia, acordose that that night he had dreamed it.
And it was really a dream the morning, when his heated brain is sleep,
giving as a brooding drunk.

Upon waking and daytime sleep had become brief but deep inside the images
and thoughts in your mind.

"I stand in my boticarito - said after the Our Father who threw for the
souls, not to forget -. Live as apañaditos. Got up, lit his fire and
went to buy, shop to shop and thought I could give a spurt
Maximiliano, throw more and more breast meat, more men, in a word, and
that damn romadizo cure chronic forced to stand ringing constantly.
The kindness of his heart there was nothing to say because he was
a saint, and as truly married, his wife had to do what he wanted.

With four words of honey, and he was happy and Achanta. What mattered
was not take in everything the opposite of consciousness and missions
... here an adjective Fortunata did not remember. _sublimes_ Was, but
the same was, and knew that was a good thing. That day lasted buying
something else, because Maximiliano Having announced that almorzaría
with her, thought to make a dish that entrambos I liked and that
was the Fortunata culinary specialty, rice with giblets.

What was so rich, it was to suck his fingers. Unfortunately there is
not time for artichokes, because it had brought rice. But
brought a little lamb who gave him that much.

Purchased schnitzel, two real giblets and a second dish for marinated
sardines. Returning to his home armed with three pots meticulous
care that Spanish cuisine demands, and started to make your rice in
the saucepan. That day there was no pileup in the kitchen that did not
work. After frying the onion and crush garlic and chop the giblets,
if nothing important was forgotten, the Lavos sinful hands and
went to comb, making it more carefully than other days.

Time passed, the kitchen off and confounded many odors. God, the slaughter
that she had! When he arrived Rubín, at twelve, left open to her
friend with cheerful face.

Was the table set, because women are multiplying that time, and I
would like everything to easily and quickly.

He said the love that was very hungry, and she recommended a
chispita patience. You forgot one very important thing, wine, and
drop to get him. But Maximilian was given to play that domestic service,
and fell more quickly than before. Half an hour later they sat at the
table in love and company, but at that moment was Fortunata sudden
onslaught of some very strange thoughts, I did not know what was
wrong.

She compared her soul in those days as a weathervane. Once marked
for one side to another. Suddenly, as if lifting a heavy wind,
the wind was big and round tip, where before he had the tail. Of
these cambiazos had felt it many, but none as of the time, the time
they got the inside scoop of rice to serve your future husband. I could
not say how she was feeling or how that came to his soul, occupying
all, but most did not know it looked and felt a horrible antipathy
to the poor boy who was violent to conceal.

Without any warning, Maximiliano praised the perfect condiment for rice,
but she fell, breaking back inside, with the first spoonful, this
farrago is bitter that I wanted to leave the heart.

Very _para between sí_, said: "First I make myself into little
pieces like these, who marry such a man ... But do not you see,
you do not see that even looks like a man ... Until it smells bad ...
I do not mean what I get when I estimate that the life I will be
looking ahead of me that rabadilla nose. "" It looks like you're
sad, MONUC "said Rubin, who used to make this affectionate nickname.

Replied that she Rice was not as good as desired. When they ate the
chops, Maximiliano told dominoes with some pedantry: "One of the
things I have to teach it to eat with fork and knife, not only fork.
But I have time to instruct you in that and other things. "He
also charged her much correction. Wished to speak well and be fine
and decent person, but how much more benefit from the lessons if the
teacher was different, without that Destiladeras nose, dull and without
that dead face, without that body was not meat, but cordilla! This
Fortunata antipathy not hindered in her estimation, and estimation
mezclábase a great pity that unhappy, knight of honor and virtue, as
morally superior to it. The esteem in which he was, gratitude,
sympathy and that inexplicable, because they are not consistent with
the above, are the cause of restraining their disgust. She was
not very strong in disguise, and one less haunted Rubín have known
that the beautiful entrecejo hiding something.

But he saw things in the lens of their own ideas, and for him everything
was as it should be and not as it was.

Fortunata Alegrose much concluded that lunch, because that would be
holding a serious conversation and listening to warnings and corrections
not much fun. Gustábale more busy collecting china and lift the
table, an operation that he put his hand as it took coffee. And to spend
more time in the kitchen in the room, reviewed the pots, and began to
chop the salad even if it was not necessary. From time to time gave
a tour of the room, where Maximilian had to study. It was not easy
to fix your attention on that day in the books. I was very distracted,
and every time her friend came, the whole pharmaceutical science
vanished from his mind. Despite this he was wanted there, and even
got angry so much something which extended the cooking time. "Girl, do
not work so much that you're tired. Bring your work and sit
here. "" It is as if I am not here to school, and what you should
consider is not to miss the year - she replied -. So if you lose
and have to re-examine why ...!». This effect was larger in the minds
of Rubín. "No matter what you're here. As long as I talk, look.
Viéndote seems to understand things better, and that I opened
the floodgates of understanding. You get here, you at your sewing,
I'm off to my books. When I am very clumsy, ¡pim!, And when you look
me awake. "Fortunata laughed a little and miss a moment, brought
the seam." You know - he told Rubin, she just sat down -- . My
brother went to Juan Pablo Molina to fix that from the estate of
Meliton aunt.

My aunt Lupe wrote before coming to Madrid was planted there.

Wrote saying that there will be no great difficulty. "- Really?

, Come on! ... Better way. - As you hear. I can not even say what we
play for each brother.

What I can assure you that I am glad of this for you, exclusively for
you. Then you complain of Providence. Because the more secure
are the materials of life, more secure is the preservation of honor.
Half of the shame that exists in life are nothing more than
poverty, women and poverty.
"Very good," she said; "but promise me, on your honor,--no, I don't
believe in it; by your salvation,--but you don't believe in God; by
your soul,--but I don't suppose you have any! what pledge /can/ you
give me of your fidelity? and yet you expect me to trust you, and put
more than my life--my love, my vengeance--into your hands?"

The slight smile which crossed the pallid lips of the spy showed
Mademoiselle de Verneuil the danger she had just escaped. The man,
whose nostrils contracted instead of dilating, took the hand of his
victim, kissed it with every mark of the deepest respect, and left the
room with a bow that was not devoid of grace.

Three hours after this scene Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who feared the
man's return, left the town furtively by the Porte Saint-Leonard, and
made her way through the labyrinth of paths to the cottage of
Galope-Chopine, led by the dream of at last finding happiness, and
also by the purpose of saving her lover from the danger that
threatened him.

Only one had to be inside set to take part in this change, to significant
bodies collect, take huge fortune, but then continued external feud
also involved and there again, probably in addition to war,
hoping luck, again off the lively People's attitudes about other countries
expand the holding of Mainz, and indeed of much more to gain try again.
For no one was now staying longer in this desolate desert area. The
King of the Garden was first, followed by the regiments. Also part
of the rigors of war to take was no longer required, and I got leave
to return home, but like I previously Mannheim return. My first course
was Ihro Royal Highness the Prince Louis Ferdinand aufzuwarten, which
I totally wohlgemut outstretched on his sofa was not entirely comfortable,
because it lying on the wound actually prevented, but he also could not
hide desire, as soon as possible on the battlefield in person to
perform again. Then I met in an inn-like adventure. On the long, very
occupied host table I sat at one end, the Kämmerier of the King, by
Rietz, on the other, a tall, wohlgebauter, strong, broad man, a figure,
as the body servant Friedrich Wilhelm did well behooves. He and his
neighborhood had been very loud and cheerfully stood on a table, I
saw Mr. Rietz to send me, he greeted me friendly, pleased my long
'desired, finally made the acquaintance said something flattering and
said, then added: I must forgive him, but he had a personal interest
in me here and see. We have always claimed him so far: good
spirits and people of genius should be small and gaunt, sickly and
vermüfft look like because you like him enough examples cited.

That's what it is apathy, but because he does not think to head
to, but healthy and strong and stalwart limbs, but is now glad he
was to me a man to find, but also the look for something, and you are
no less a genius apply for leave. He's looking forward and wish us
both a long duration of such a comfort. I replied equally binding
words, he shook my hand and I could console myself that if those
sympathetic Obrist Lieutenant rejected my presence, which is probably
also a person had expected vermüffte I now, admittedly in an entirely
opposite category to honor came. In Heidelberg, the old faithful friend
Delph, I met my brother and childhood friend locksmiths. We even
talked about some things, he also had a presentation of my color
theory endure.

Ernst and friendly, he took them on whether he thought the same of
which he had fixed, could not escape and, above all, insisted to
know how my editing with the Euler theory unite leave, he was
affectionate.

Unfortunately I had to confess that on my way after this do not
ask, but that was about to do, countless experiences to close to
bring them to arrange their relationship, the position next to one
another and to find himself and to others understood make.

This kind of liked him but because I show little experiments could
not be very clear.

Hiebei Now that the difficulty of the undertaking itself hervortat
shows' I give him an essay, I found during the siege had written
what I said: as a Men's diverse society to work together and every
one of his side with eingereifen could order such a difficult and
large enterprises to help.

I had the philosopher, the physicist, mathematician, painter,
mechanic, dyers, and God knows who all claimed this he heard in
general very patiently, when I gave him but the paper wanted to
read in detail, prohibiting it's me and laughed from: I was, he
said, in my old days is still a child and a newcomer, that I imagine
that there would be someone to attend to that, and I showed interest,
there would be someone else's procedures and approve it to make
his, there could be some in Germany, a joint action and participation
to take place!

"Ha!" he cried, "you said you were going to Florigny, but you are in
the valley of Gibarry! I am a fool, she has tricked me! No matter, I
can light my lamp by day as well as by night."

Corentin, satisfied that he knew the place of the lovers' rendezvous,
returned in all haste to the little square, which Hulot, resolved not
to wait any longer, was just quitting to rejoin his troops.

It is necessary to foresee everything.

Yo I'm going to present two cases that you can offer legal in your life,
and for two, let me give you my advice, free, fair, with a great
sense of reality.

First case: suppose that the short time to live with Maximilian find
the boy behaves well with you, you'll see their good qualities,
manifested in every act of life, and also suppose that you have some
love .. .. Fortunata was staring at a point on the ground, like a sword,
plunged it so well I could not desclavar. Sure that you heard, but
it looked, Feijoo continued speaking slowly, putting the breaks
between terms. "Suppose that ... So your duty in this case, it is
esforzarte that this baby ... call it friendship, raise as much as
possible. Work on yourself to succeed. Ah, my child, the treatment
works miracles, and also makes them good. Avoid idleness while and see
how what you think so hard you should be very easy.

There have been cases, but many cases of women forced together by a
hateful man and that you have been taking law bit by bit until you
get the most tender butter. I do not say anything if you have kids,
because then ...». - What is it with vividness ...!-- indicated Fortunata.
- Look at how silly! And what do you know? It is not certain such
a thing. Nature always goes where it is thought less ... And with
kids, and got more than halfway gone to reach the calm that I recommend,
as in raising them and caring you wear over the feeling that you
are the soul of God, and you are balanced, and most do not nonsense
... Well, we have already discussed the first case, which is the better
move on to second.

We present in anticipation of failure of the first, which could well
happen. Here we go ... Fortunata waiting anxiously for the second
exposure, but Feijoo took it in stride because it was good while
meditating, with the gathering frown and eyes fixed on the floor.
"The best thing - continued - is what I tell you, but when you can not
do better, is the least bad ... You know? Assuming you will not be
possible with this encariñarte blessed, and that neither treatment
nor good clothes you make it less unpleasant, if life gets unbearable
to tell, y. .. Go this is reckless, and it takes all my courage to
advise. But I, first of all, I see the practical, possible, and I
can not advise anyone to be left to die or commit suicide. Should
not be imposed sacrifices superior to human forces. If the heart is
preserved at the size you now, if there is no means to cut, if you
are silent, what can we do? Within the poor, let's see what is best
among the worst, y. .. '. Feijoo dig more words to express his own
thought.

The ideas are a little troublemaker and not required to submit
embarullarse. Giving a great sigh, his hand went to his head, lost
sight in space. Leaving the end of their perplexity, cautious
voice said: "In an extreme case, I mean, if you look at disparadero
missing, guards decorum and have done the least bad possible ...

Decorum, propriety, decency, this is the secret, mate '. Detúvose scared,
like the thief who feel noise, and again put his hand on his head,
citing as his hair. But his hair did not say anything. The point is
emboldened, and regained the safety of his language, saying: "You
are too inexperienced to know how important it is in the world. You
know yourself what is the form, or rather, the forms? So do not say
that these are all but there are cases where almost everything. With
them running the company, do not tell that to ask of mouth,
but the best I can go. Oh, the principles are a very nice thing, but
the shapes are not lower.

Between a company without principles, and forms a free society, I
do not know what I would be with me. "- X - Fortunata had understood.
Made an affirmative sign with her head and crossed his hands on one of
his knees, gave his body movements or rocking remadera.

A Feijoo had cost him some work started to show his moral in those
circumstances, because he was the conscience a knot, it pressed for a
short while, but at what point broke evoking the theories that he had
professed all his life. Launched therefore the more dangerous, he
continued as a silk, smooth and knot free. "You know what my ideas about
love. Imperious claim of Nature ... Nature _auméntame_ saying ...
There is no means of opposing ... the human race ... who shouts
_quiero crecer_ You understand?

Is this clear? I need to use parables or examples?. Fortunata understood,
still rocking back and forward, emphasizing their claims with uncombed
head. "Well, I say no more.

This is very delicate, so delicate as a gun mounted to the dryer,
with which you can not play.

It is always preferable to the first case, the case of loyalty,
since this break with nature and the world.

The second you put a _por if acaso_, and to ... Put this in your five
senses ... so that if you look at the trance by irresistible demands
of the heart, to lay down the principle, know how to save ...».

Here again my man to feel the knot, but evoking again their philosophy
of many years, it has unleashed. "We need to save in any case the
holy appearances and tributes to the company that external worship
without which revert to the wild. Our relationship is such that when
the secret is to be achieved. It'sa matter of style and skill. If
I had time right now, you would infinitos cases peccadillo committed
an absolute, without any scandal, without the slightest offense to
the dignity that we all must ...

Te pasmarías. Hear what I say and apréndetelo memory. The first thing
you need to do is hold the _orden público_, I mean the peace of
marriage, respect your husband and not consent to lose your dignity
in such ... Say it is difficult, but the talent is there, mate ...
We must think, above all, penetrates the decency to find himself
looking for the others ... Here the second ...». D. Evaristo came
over her, as if afraid someone might hear, and with the index
finger was stiff ticking very well what I said.

"The second thing is you have to choose carefully, this is
esencialísimo; great care to see who ... in seeing who's conclusion
...». concept is not leaving, not wanting to leave.

Fortunata Looking at the rush, came to remedy, saying: "Understood,
understood." - Well, I need not add anything more ... because if you
fall into the temptation of wanting to disgrace a man, my money
goodbye, goodbye decorum ... And the last thing I recommend is that
if you can not manage to get tentarte again Mamelouk Santa Cruz,
have put a pike in Flanders. That said, the old man stood up, taking
coat and hat, was ready to leave. Turned towards the door Fortunata,
and lifting the cane gesture of command, said: "I repeat what was
before. That is over ... and now I am your father, you my daughter ...
you treat me ... occupied our seats ... Learn to live everyday life
... For suddenly, serenity, and concluded peinarte, which is late. I'm
going to have much to do. Metiose the original Simon in his
moralistic, and had barely reached the Plaza de los Carros, began to
feel his soul in an inexplicable anxiety. And after the wine a certain
moral concern physical discomfort, with some shaking and chills,
accompanied by superstitious terror ... But I could not identify
the cause of fear ... The car ran for the High-Cava, and Feijoo
was getting worse. Suddenly felt like an intense vibration in it, and
like a lightning lance shooting atravesole part separately.

He thought it was an unknown tongue shouted: "Stupid, go a few things
to teach your daughter ...!».

He extended his hand to stop and tell the coachman to return to the
streets of TABERNILLAS, but before doing that way, stopped to shimmy
had felt in his soul, and everything was at rest ...

"How weak! - Thought - and these are nothing more than chocheces and
chocheces ... ¿No, I came back there to go back?

Do not be a reseller, partner, supporter and now you've always
believed. This is the practical, is the only possible ...

If you recommend an absolute virtue, what would it be? Sermon
absolutely lost.

And at least they continued ...». so satisfied. In the bustle I had
those days, which made two visits to Doña Lupe, held many conferences
with John Paul and other substances with very Rubín Nicolas, who
walked behind a sinecure desalted, the good Lord had a relapse in
his illness.

One afternoon in late March was so bad that had to retire to his
house and slept. Doña Paca warned him, together with the worsening of
symptoms, some feverish joy, so thought of bad omen, because if your
child or love became so mad when malito was, this signal was the
proximity of the end.

All night he was running around from one place to another, trying to
get up and denying that he had a prisoner in the prison of those
damned sheets.

At dawn, clouded his senses, and point of losing consciousness, the
world said goodbye to this sensible concept that only male left
to Magín lips: "I can die in peace because I know the demon of
snatch foolish soul who already had her fingernails between ...».

Doña Paca and the servant, believing that his master was at the spasm
began to shrieks, call the doctor, gave Mr many washes, and finally
volviéronle to life.

All were stunned to see him smiling and you do not hear him say anything
and hurt he was feeling well and happy.

But despite this, the doctor became very bad, predicting that the
brain and nervous weakness soon end with the patient.

Even if this is emboldened, he could not get up and forces him iban
missing. Absolutely no appetite. Friends who accompanied him that
day, agreed to tell the most difficult to prepare spiritually
for the final transfer, dealing with the business of saving
his soul. They believed that the most Evaristo D. alborotaría
this is because he always boasted of the free thinker, but with
everyone's surprise, he heard the words as calmer and more polite,
saying he had his beliefs, but at the same time like to fulfill any
obligation by the concurrence of the greatest number.

"I believe in God - he said - and here I have my religion in my own
way.

The respect we owe the men to each other, I would like to meet any
requirement of any company that orders organized. I've always been
stuck in good form. Tráiganme you want as many cures that I was not
scared of anything or fear anything, not ever desentono. Not decompose,
and this is my theme. All present marveled to hear, and that day will
be administered the sacraments. Then it became much better, which
gave him reason to say, as is use and custom, that religion is
medicine of the body and soul. He assured that no one was dying of
arrechucho, who had seven lives like a cat, and it was quite
possible that God would stop throwing some more time to enable
pilgrims to see very many things.

             This was indeed, as throughout the 75 years that he ran was not a
practical philosopher died.

Convalescence During that attack, Fortunata was not allowed to see
him. He wrote some cartitas, reiterating his advice and making new
ones for the next day and that reconciliation should take place. At the
time occupied in revising his will and take several charities that
some people were very grateful. Had a small flow through different
loans to needy friends. Some had signed promissory notes, one thousand,
two and even three thousand reais. All these papers were torn. It had
been how to divide the jewelry I had, quite some value, with
beautiful solitaire rings, buttoning, and primary boxes in ivory
and sandalwood that was brought from the Philippines, a beautiful
sword, two or three sticks of command in the fist gold.

Made the distribution of all with a wisdom that said his great sensitivity
and appreciation of the friendships that were consistent.

Fortunata regard to how well it provided that no more. Not in his
will he left a few gifts, calling _ahijada_, but through a broker very
discreet, an operation that appeared as purchasers of chulita certain
amount of shares of the Bank, giving further Handheld hand, some
quantities tickets. Do not forget why D. Evaristo her relatives, two
nieces who were residing in the an Astorga, Ponferrada in the other.
Both were very well cared for in the will, and in terms of relief sent
to them annually, this year did not lose the memory of this obligation,
despite the many headaches you had. Doña Paca and the two would also
be raised a pinch on the day the love was missing. Indicáronle
clergy of the parish if it did not make something to vote for his
soul, and he, with a kind smile, replied that he had not forgotten any
of the duties of social courtesy, and that no Desafinado anything,
it was because of the rengloncito masses. He went to see him one afternoon
Villalonga, and the first thing he told Feijoo, while embraced by the
left, was this: "But man, is it so bad that you do not give my canonry
recommended?. "- Jesus, beloved patriarch, have patience ... I will
do whatever I can. I got a very expressive letter to Cardenas sending
the note. But you think that is an arc of church. ¡Canonry! For me, I
would like. - And to me too ... But anyway, can be or not? Cleriguito
is one of the best conditions. - I think ... But what you want! These
charges are very sought after, and when a cow, there are four
priests in the teeth of this size. - Yeah, but my priest is a
priest apreciabilísimo, a holy man ...

As fast that every day ... -- Ya ... this is a cod father
Rubín. Do you already gave you a card for a criminal Rubín? You obviously
protects the family. - I do not protect families, children. Let
your protections ...

I only came to people of merit. - For me not to be. I will give
you another achuchón to Cardenas. But what I say, are many places
that have a sweet tooth. Suitors valimiento and exploit the influence
of the ladies. The slopes are almost always those who decide who
has to sit in the choirs of cathedrals. - Well, would you, mate, I
have a skirt, I'm a lady ... ea. - But if I decide I do not ...
- You see that if I appoint my canon, I do not die, and will haunt him
for months. - Best ... You live a thousand years. - And these elections
are going well - like a steel.

I have a father there a cure worth empire. I was doing repairs in
the district, that God plaster and plaster the entire Holy Trinity.

That it deserved, I say no sinecure, but seven Mitra. - I know, the
_Pater_ ... was chaplain of my regiment.

Villalonga was sacked by reiterating his good wishes for Nicolas
Rubin. "Hey, Jacinto, by God, a word! - said D.

Evaristo calling when he was in the door -.

By God and all the saints, do not you forget me in that wretched ...

Villaamil the poor, in that they call _Ramsés II_. "- is recommended
in a note _indispensables_.

So I can not do more. - Check that you will not let me live ...
Every day is three-fold.

The night I got the Viaticum, at that, I looked for this side and
the first thing he saw was a _Ramsés II_, with a candle in his hand.

How I looked the man! ... I think I died so much as Villaamil prayed,
asking God to live. - May be ...

Do not forget. Abura, abura. AND D. Evaristo was alone, thoughtful
and sweetly self-absorbed, sipping on his conscience pure enjoyment
to their peers all the good possible, or to have avoided the bad to
the extent that Providence has given to the human endeavor.

-V-Other catering - i - The very orderly routine and become accustomed
to the calm sweetness of the method in life, they conclude, abused
in some way on the regularity, by subjecting the box of time, not
just jobs, but acts and functions of the mind and body that seem
even more rebels to the system in hours.

She tore herself from his arms as if suddenly
awakened, and sprang from the cottage. Her coolness came back to her,
and she thought of the situation.

"He might have accepted me and scorned me," she reflected. "Ah! if I
could think that, I would kill him. But not yet!" she added, catching
sight of Beau-Pied, to whom she made a sign which the soldier was
quick to understand. He turned on his heel, pretending to have seen
nothing. Mademoiselle de Verneuil re-entered the cottage, putting her
finger to her lips to enjoin silence.

"They are there!" she whispered in a frightened voice.

"Who?"

"The Blues."

"Ah! must I die without one kiss!"

"Take it," she said.

He caught her to him, cold and unresisting, and gathered from her lips
a kiss of horror and of joy, for while it was the first, it might also
be the last. Then they went together to the door and looked cautiously
out. The marquis saw Gudin and his men holding the paths leading to
the valley. Then he turned to the line of gates where the first rotten
trunk was guarded by five men. Without an instant's pause he jumped on
the barrel of cider and struck a hole through the thatch of the roof,
from which to spring upon the rocks behind the house; but he drew his
head hastily back through the gap he had made, for Hulot was on the
height; his retreat was cut off in that direction. The marquis turned
and looked at his mistress, who uttered a cry of despair; for she
heard the tramp of the three detachments near the house.

"Go out first," he said; "you shall save me."

- Secondly, the duties of the monastery of Lilienthal women to read and
forward the same, whereupon the Ordensgespielinnen or Lehnserben and
called them the duty of chickens to be delivered. Where in our Kabinetchen
a year since you sang: "God you grüß moon and star slip ,
Entlaubet is the Fensterlein! "duties of the monastery of women
Lilienthal. When I Johanni on the day after the year 1318 for the
three lady lilies at higher reminder of God and her urgent requests
Lilienthal founded the monastery and equipped, this monastery was
obliged Lilienthal, the bride - and every funeral of Hainaut and
Countess Lehnshuldinn of Vadutz, what a gem on his shoulders bears,
convent three maidens, and to assist in perpetuity three white
lilies on my grave to receive .-- There are, however, these three
sisters at the monastery of such opportunity with the words up:
"You Remember lilies in the garden of night, Remember the tender,
The maintaining you, Remember the grace, The gethaut upon you, And
scent trails on the lovely bride, And calls on the grave, in which
it now rests, that they have peace, love and was good.

"There tended to the monastery three white women against the right
shoulder of the ancestress and you heard the words again:" O star
and flower, spirit and dress, love, suffering and time and eternity!

"This is approaching the mother and Sarge the Gackeleias identified
four of the eight Amaranthbänder obtained from the belt of the
ancestress expired, the right and four on the left side of the coffin
out, and by the wide sleeves a little bit about the ivory hagern
hands of the ancestress in the amount moved, she said: "see Gackeleia,
as the adage has proven itself again - on the hoof know the lion by
the hand and the Countess of Hainault .-- If we do not know, so
we'd say these hands that the Countess of Hainault include Amey.
Sieh , Gackeleia from her, we have the so-called Hainault Dockadaumen
thumb inherited or grace. " Gackeleia kissed the hands of the ancestress
respectfully by the father asked where the name because Hainault
thumb mercy come, because erwiederte Gockel: "the whole family
is from Hainault maternal side of a Roman emperor and his wife Curio
Docka ago, Christians have become, after Germany and also pulled
the country Vadutz founded. But it was the pagan Romans in a cruel
amusement, men with swords on death and life with each other to
fight. If one of the fighters was subject, put him and the other a
knife to the throat and looked around, whether it Toedter wanted
to leave or pardon, but if you are now required to overcome the stay
should live, who lifted their hands in the air and closed the thumb
into the thumb, which was the sign of grace, which is equal Kaiserinn
Docka after its birth, the hands in this position have had, so that the
mother exclaimed: "Oh my dear child you are a child of grace!" - but
Docka held at every opportunity, where there was help and rescue,
from his earliest youth on their hands always in favor of this
position, so that their thumbs are then formed quite the same grace and
one thumb, Dockadaumen called it, and it is this hand of
education to all countesses from Hainault, with the great tendency
to pardon and forgive, is inherited .-- See Gackeleia , hence the
use of ways; the point that they say, believe me the thumbs, if
you require someone else to be with his whole soul of our luck. ""
Now we know everything, "said Gackeleia," really, as they say, until
on the fingernail, we know why the three lilies and three white
women in the monastery ancestress love under the lime chicken stand,
and why they suffered at the eight plants of the eight Ordensgespielen
poor child of Hainault festively decorated to appear and chickens
in a basket under his arm bear.

They come to the corpses of the oldest-transfer poor children of
Hainault and Brautzug of the youngest, and that's me! - You want
to deliver their duty chickens .-- Quick, quick, let us receive it,
I see, they vary even a little impatient, confused. Well, I call
them - "In the name of your childishness of the Countess of Hainault
Amey, first Lehnshuldin of Vadutz and first child of poor, I urge
Hainault, Queen of Gackeleia Gelnhausen, Countess of Hainaut and
in Gockelsruh, latest Lehnshuldin of poor Vadutz and youngest child
of Hainault, - you, Ordensgespielen first eight, the eight compulsory
chicken deliver .-- First, I call on.

Miss Ornitogalia, for on 30 April 1318 received pasture deliver
justice from a Hirtenhuhn!

"At this cry floated Ornitogalia, one of the herbs Kränzlein chickens
milk to the blond curls and a beautiful chicken in a basket-bearing,
between the coffin and Gackeleia.

They bowed out against the spirit of the ancestress, then his knees
and kissed the Order, the corpse in the coffin wore.

Then they rose again, leaned her head against the gem right armpit
braces Gackeleias, then sat with her basket Hirtenhuhn to their
feet and took him back under the arm, as it concerns the first of
the eight bands took amaranthfarbenen and calmly in their place
stopped .-- This Gackeleia called after the number seven on Miss.

All wore wreaths of herbs, their name and the Order of the joyfully
pious children, and that any such Ornitogalia. - Osterluzia provided
for on 1 May received piece of forest Waldhuhn .-- Kretellina brought
on 7 May received right, in the forest to graze, a Grashuhn .--
Serpoleta were on 14 for the May lent annual wood needed Rauchhuhn
.-- Morgelina had on 21 May the law get in the forest to collect
leaves and brought a Laubhuhn .-- Moskatellina paid for on 28 May
received a cornfield Aehrenhuhn .-- Kornelia made their Lehnspflicht
for a 4 June Rosengarten received a Gartenhuhn. - Esparsetta paid
for on 13 June, Whit Monday, received Feldgut a Pfingsthuhn .--
When all Ordensgespielinnen their duty and make the eight tapes to
touch on the right and left of the coffin were flowers, collected
Gackeleia and the two front Kronovus, Gockel Hinkel and the two
rear bars of the stretcher and moved Flowers with the coffin to the
chapel .-- The spirit of the ancestress followed his own body to
grave .-- It was a moving sight of the grandeur .-- Behind the eight
Ordensgespielinnen colorful flowers surrounded the coffin, in which
the pale, poor child from Hainault in tiefrothem ivory gown like a
serious young lady seemed to slumber, floated his own mind between
the three white women monastery who wore lilies - even a lily - in
ineffably touching simplicity, in white, long dress, spindle bearing
and Brod, disguised the main crowned with white roses, with sweet
peace in the face over the flowers and grass tops then.

One of the three virgins monastery, which they more than the two others
seemed to love, helped her to train demüthig .-- All three sang:
"The pure lily glory emblazoned with greater scope, as ever in his
King Solomon dress you are wearing this bridal gown since your
baptismal 'on earth, you could never geschmücket be wonderful.

"What the mind of the ancestress of wehmüthiger intimacy again
sang," O star and flower, spirit and dress, love, suffering and time
and eternity!

"But now came the whole train grateful to the spirits of the poor,
which had adorned the coffin, she wore the shimmering flags of
Röckchen, shirt, apron, jacket, Mützchen, the good works of the poor
child of Hainault. But who was very, very last, so that nothing
more came behind him - none other than those old woman with a blue
apron, which all funeral processions, and trains must come last -
the compound, solid person who is not in heaven, not on earth and
does not know where it is and who she is.

All investigations of the so-excellent secret police Gelnhausen
but have no decisive information about them to date, as it hot,
it should be a question mark buckliches behind a corpse Seyn speech,
we believe it is a kind of statements, they admit to a certain
belief etc. from more .-- We all looked at their way habhaft to be
presented one at all Blaufärbern spies in order to take some if
they wanted their new apron colored, but they did not stain.

Finally it was the embellishment of the Commission, as the artistic
taste and dignity of such magnificence annoying traits, and by the
Commission as a reconnaissance abgeschmackter old superstition null
and void in Contumaziam explained .-- The Oberhof Easter Haas wrote
a prize winning against them, what they for an optical illusion,
or at most for the fifth wheel on the car said that, as often it's
also mention, but never since sey .-- Under the government of
Kronovus but was because he himself, despite all zero - and
invalidities statement after the funeral of his father Mr Eifrasius
allerhöchstaugenscheinlich herschleichen view, writing about
everything they banned and introduced, in their sight always assigned
to a poor, a new blue apron to give, you have noticed that since
they always create a new blue bear aprons, and that the blue dye
in Gelnhausen such an upturn has won that she baker - butcher guild
and nothing nachgiebt.

So now the train came into the chapel, where the precedence Alektryos
and everything gallinas Federvieh present deep eigendlich espalier
made.

As with the coffin before the altar came Gackeleia turned the ring, the
grave Urgockels opened, because they saw the skeleton of the old
gentleman in the respectable range Grafenornat even below resting.

Now put the eight Ordensgespielinnen, the eight bands in the hand in
the coffin of the ancestress back and took the tapes similar to
the belt Gackeleias belonged, and stood for a while about them.

They lowered the coffin beside the coffin of Urgockels down, the grave
is closed, the maidens presented their baskets with the chickens
to and laid their wreaths all around .-- The spirit of the woman
Urhinkel floated against the light Urgockels gravestone, the three
women with the monastery lilies stood to his feet.

A light cloud filled the chapel and moved to the top like a open
sky, then hovered the spirit of love Amey Countess of Hainault
monastery between the three women Gackeleia .-- said to the eight
maidens to her: "God bless you, dear Gespielen I thank your loyalty,
follow the love heart in the place where it is better than here in
Gockelsruh!

" because they tended to her right shoulder and floated into the
light path of the first child of hinan Hainault, and the whole
procession of the poor and moved back after you heard the song: "O
star and flower, spirit and dress, love, suffering and time and
eternity!

"always quieter and quieter until it is completely silent, and most
recently Everything in the chapel was like before, because you
could see the stone image of women Urhinkel with Urgallina on the
shoulder next to the Urgockels on the wall and looked under the same
three white lilies on the altar shows.

At the grave in front of the altar, the wreaths of Ordensgespielen
root beaten and green all the herbs from which they existed .--
Gackeleia over the revered Alektryo the chicken, in which she
immediately took oath and duty, and together with the other chickens
in the chicken farm community led, where a wedding feast of Waitz
grains, Brodsamen, all green, cockchafer, earthworms and other
delicacies was prepared. - While all this was continually rung the
bell, ran the art piece is always ringing with the bag around and
ended the organist and her prima donna Fugue .-- This was not
continued to train in motion, the coat of arms flags followed by
the boys blumentragenden, scattering the flowers Mägdlein, the
youths with the gifts of Solomon - then Kronovus and Gackeleia what
the art piece in the arm was, and Gockel and last Hinkel which, as
she exited the door, and Gallina Alektryo on the shoulder flew .--
So the train arrived in the beautiful Raugräflich-Chen Gockel dining
room, where an excellent meal was applied.

In the whole palace went it funny that many good people from
Gelnhausen, which was about as surprised Pallast Gockel were
ExtraEnergy Post hergefahren.

The Lord post master had nothing to thun, when inserted, the Lord
Schirrmeister smeared inexhaustible, the Lord blew itself Postillon
virtually from the Athem. Everything in Gelnhausen kurfähig was
drawn to the Count's table, and even the secret Oberhof Easter
Haas, all knights and knights of the high egg inner Order, many
traveling artists and scholars and professional persons, who just
at the Frankfurt Fair durchpassirten, used the rare opportunity for
all to see the glory .-- There were a lot of guests so that all
moments Gackeleia the ring had to turn to the table to extend.

A large table just took the Oberhof Easter Haas, because he had
recommended him großmächtige, wide Schottländerinn to himself, whose
followers from a life-size gingerbread figures-cabinet, and a
body-Lebküchler which, with all its sat at a table .-- The Oberhof
Easter Haas noted the high lords with the words that "the very
honorable Kounteß Samsonia Molle Gothol, masters from St.

Edward's chair, on which the kings of England will be anointed a
Nachkomminn the Scottish kings, Gothol, Simon Breach, Fergus ,
Kenneth, etc., which have for centuries before the Christian era,
on stones that have gethronet on which Jacob slept at Bethel Luz
and now in St.

             Eduards chair is preserved, which is entrusted to their care.

This lady is high to me from the Academy of Old Superstitions druidical
strongly recommended, it has a black melancholy through to urälterliche
and ancestors came to studies, they have by their Kinderstühlchen
before St. Eduards chair is preserved in the rocks initially Jacob
playing with the doll to watch, and then sat brooding by Counties
about the origin of this stone before louder children of God and the
people and the many children of Israel to own lost childhood. But now
she travels with her Kinderstühlchen around the same place again and
to set. Since they all from egg to fathom must, and my little merit
as undignified Oberhof Easter Haas has heard, she hoped, perhaps
in an Easter egg, the true child head to find, but unfortunately in
vain - it is her long stay in County Vadutz became known that the
Lehnshuldinnen this county Rebekkas the armpit braces at the
shoulders, and because they know that these little gems with the stone
of Jacob connected, so they wish for their studies, a more detailed
knowledge of this Alterthümer written, simultaneous instruments obtain
her .-- The gingerbread is still Theil, their pagan ancestors, the
Scottish kings Gothol, Breach, Fergus, Kenneth, and the like. The
accompanying body-Lebküchler works with louder honey from the jaws
of the lion Samson, and since they are an idea that her name's patron,
as his enemies with the Eselskinnbacken kills, honey cake pond poussiren
wants, she has taken him to complete studies to skitziren , which is
very entertaining and he has mich schon portraitirt, and it is
like, not like the other Osterei .-- This worthy Märtyrin seriousness
now, I recommend the theilnehmenden child - and child-childishness
of the royal and noble family, allerunterthänigster, unworthy Oberhof
Easter Haas.

"Gackeleia felt a great Theilnahme for honorable Kounteß and wanted to
hug, but she was too big and too broad and would not bend over
because Gackeleia be helped with the ring and turned down the Kounteß
that they just large was enough and closed them warmly in her arms,
while this very well to Muth ward, so they said smilingly: "You can
also childishness over Brod eat!"

Gackeleia smiled and turned back into the Kounteß their big, broad
shape back what all sat down to dinner .-- The fact that more than
Gackeleia Brod could eat, demonstrated the kitchen of labels wedding
meal, because out of respect for the Kounteß transformed Gackeleia
through the ring Salomonis Gelnhausen the whole meal in a
Schottländische, and the astonishment of the contract in question
servants and the embarrassment of the Gelnhausen guests who did not
know how they should handle foreign courts, the whole festival
erlustigte .-- Especially much contributed to the overall pleasure
of the body-Lebküchler at the Kounteß Gothol.

It sat between the images of their Vorältern, Oberhof it next to the
Easter-Haas at the bottom of Counties and was in labor, that he is
aware of the sweat broke out, he had a large pond next to buckets of
honey, and he with big appetite to eat seemed, kneaded it with spoons,
knives and forks, the image attendees from any dough on the floor of
his plate, then he sought a fresh plate and let the others at
the table from hand to hand, what a great stir among all the guests
made. When Gackeleias image Kronovus and Kronovus image Gackeleia came,
they were taken so that they can freßlieb won, and that was at
once a fashion at the table, ate one of the changing picture.
Gackeleia since turned to melancholy Kounteß again by a tractor
to cheer up the ring Salomonis that all their Lebzelter-Vorältern
beside her live and talk with her and just want to wish the
neugeformten faces with the Lebküchler thun.

It was now a strange fun, the old Scottish kings fiengen with the Kounteß,
and then among the stone of Jacob to disputiren and very violently,
the faces, the artist formed on the plates, cut faces and stretched
out his tongue, he was reluctant about the mouths kneaded them,
since they blew it on the cheeks, it was a short Counties variety
of grimaces.

Now all the kings anfiengen, the Meth Aepfelwein and efficient
and also to award the Lebküchler often zutranken, there was dispute
and they threw the plate into his face and modellirten quite magnificent
with the mug on their heads around. These ancient Scots kings had a
kind of peasant war among themselves and soon it was soon that asset
- and in between was always from the stone of Jacob screamed, but
they could be any agreement.

All that was good Kounteß a stone of contention, they knew no more
what they think of their ancestors should hold, she came trembling
and quivering with her Kinderstühlchen to Gackeleia went and leaned
her head big help, because Gackeleia to the disputes to watch on
the chair rise was entirely comfortable against the armpits of their
band right shoulder with the words: "O my God, what a Greul, o where
Seyde it out, its beautiful days of my childhood!"

- Gackeleia but turned the ring with the desire that all want the dispute
ends in innocent, entertain and transform objects as soon as the
kings and the Lebküchler to Hollundermännchen what each other on
the head and were back on their feet purzelten what general applause
took place.

The remains of the gingerbread-Theil images were of the originals and
some of Alektryo Gallina and eaten. - Even the Kounteß smiled about
it and said, "since I arm brace of Rebecka touched, I such a childlike
peace, such a pleasure to heart came to me that it is ridiculous
vorkömmt, as I so horrible about the stone that Jacob can study, o
now I have no desire more than that I still like my Kinderstühlchen
beside St.

Eduards chair and my doll to represent could. "- This speech pleased
the Count's whole family so well that Gockel Kinderstühlchen her
on the table and the doll that was what he lend her the Order of
Kinderei, Kronovus the Order of the golden Ostereis with two yolks,
and the Order Gackeleia the devout children joyfully umhängten,
they moved together and took them into the middle and drank health
and everything was full of joy and glory .-- Gockel but was now the
great ancestress of the diary, which is before them for the gifts
of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba lay on the table and handed it
Kounteß with the request, because they are so very much for writing
instruments interessire and a nice debate, so, let them with the
lecture decide the meal, there will probably be their joy and some
of the clips of Rebecka and the Stones recorded Seyn Jacob .-- She
took the book, it scrolls a little back and forth like a child who
is not in the mood to read, and said: "there are no pictures is,
that's a pity it I am also now quite illegible to Muth; me is so
funny and childish that I must take together properly to me because
on the table up to my Kinderstühlchen to sit down and with their
feet to pampeln.

How ridiculous, even impossible at this my very big powerful figure
now seems, I must nevertheless own fight, for my Seelchen sitting
on it and really lets everyone his beautiful new red shoes admire.

Her vanity, repressed for a time by the cruel
alternations of hope and misconception, was awakened and showed her
all the benefits of a great position. - But have not you? - Rubin
asked. - No, ma'am. If you are in school ...-- replied Severiana
-; internal College señoritas Doña Visitation. - Yeah ... who is
better ... there ... _desapartada_ me. Yesterday ... What a pity!
... I do not know ... So much time without seeing me! ... I was
afraid ... my poor soul! ... fear, as they say ... Neither his mother
was the coconut ... Here they heard footsteps, and looked all at
the door. Doña Guillermina Era, which came, as always, very rushed,
burning cheeks, with his long dark shawl, its Zapatón its merino
skirt.

Doña Lupe Fortunata and rose, and the founder greeted with kindness
and grace that were equal to the King and for the last of the beggars.
Doña Lupe believed not recognize, just as had been discussed once
in the role of the Asylum, but the recognized, and even the name,
because as Wilhelmina was the captains who have memory Felicísimo
name and appearance, and soldier Once you speak, do not run in them.
"My niece," said the widow presented, and the Wilhelmina looked
smiling. "It is unknown to me his face ...

I have seen in Micaela ... For many years ". Then dirigiose Mauritius,
supporting both hands on the bed. "What you are today?

¿Eat something ... Nothing, that heavy rain will happen soon. Morning
to receive God. How is this awareness? Good you are going to wipe. That
will be better than nothing.

I loved you pick on my own and do confess, because the Lord telling
yourself how good piece that you are, the Lord would give you his
grace ...

So get ready. This afternoon the father again odd. He said either you
confess. I figure that'll still take some stool, huh? ". Mauricia
is smiling, cut and confusing.

The head said yes. - Well, these wells are hard to miss out, because
the devil will grab anything - said the saint, patting his beard -.
So you know ... Tomorrow we have great party here ... You think so?
Come and visit the one who made heaven and earth ... You look like
you do not deserve ... Congratulations though not because he is
coming, and will know why. The vivacity, grace and passion that
Guillermina said these things, impressed the four women heard
that. Severiana two lagrimones let go. Fortunata felt in his soul so
much admiration for the woman who would have kissed the edge of
clothing. 'Then they say that no good people in the world - I
thought -.

¿Well, this and ... Watch it all mandar a walk, home, family,
fortune, love, and sacrifice their youth to go all the miseries ...!».
Asustábase living with the thought of measuring the distance between
it and the illustrious lady, surely infinite distance, and in any
manner that could be shortened, because although people pecara
holy, and she did many charitable works, the two souls ever seen
come close.

The founder, with lively activities that put all that gave to some
Severiana for the ceremony was being prepared. "Here, put that
bedside is in another room, and made the altar.

I'll be sending a crucifix, flowers and look ... The bed
clothes should be put clean, and decorate around the room as best you
can ...». He went to the room, followed by Doña Lupe, who wanted to
stick trick all costs: "We will be glad to come morning. I am very
appreciative to Mauritius, not for the damn service, it would be a
good woman, hardworking, faithful ...

And you tell me: at night should be velarla. I would not have any
problem with night stay, and if not, my niece ...». - God will pay
you ... Is accepted, it is accepted. Please agree with you Severiana.
The commander and I have been last night. Two people are needed,
because when you give seizures, and God help fix it. - Truly - Doña
Lupe said with adulation - and the examples you give, ma'am, do all
the other better than we would if you did not exist. The flower was
well conceived, but Guillermina laughed, thanking the flower, but we
do not want to take. 'Examples yo! I wish. I could use someone to
give me me. Oh, daughter! I am to teach me not to teach. "- What do you
have to say? Even likes to draw the account of everything that goes
... Well, friend, you is not as good and rebates. - Remove you, remove
you ... That says to conceal. Heaven only knows the mercies that
you, the quiet will be done in this world, for the same Mauricia maybe
...! And now wants me to hang myself. - I! ... Jesus! I am not
saying I do not have some good works in my cuentecita from heaven but
compared to you ...! Street by God, ma'am. - Well, is not that a hassle
for us to sin less ... who do you think you?
A score
of times did Mademoiselle de Verneuil raise the window-curtain, hoping
to see the smoke rising above the rocks; but the fog only took a
grayer tone, which her excited imagination turned into a warning. At
last she let fall the curtain, impatiently resolving not to raise it
again. She looked gloomily around the charming room to which she had
given a soul and a voice, asking herself if it were done in vain, and
this thought brought her back to her preparations.

"Francine," she said, drawing her into a little dressing-room which
adjoined her chamber and was lighted through a small round window
opening on a dark corner of the fortifications where they joined the
rock terrace of the Promenade, "put everything in order. As for the
salon, you can leave that as it is," she added, with a smile which
women reserve for their nearest friends, the delicate sentiment of
which men seldom understand.

"Ah! - The Savior defines the key sky into your hands - you eternal
flower. - Gotteshülfe sey thee forever .-- one thousand green leaves,
you have pure, fine sheaf full healing power - and Floramor,
amaranthus, which shimmers purpursammtne Amaranth thee, that your
heart smiles, etc. - who can pronounce all the love that the flowers
were born - to her feet indicated the Jerusalem flower, the fiery
love, loyalty to the man's love and faithfulness Count Gockel.

All these flowers were many durchflochten and white roses at the
corners of the coffin stood lilies out, and both knew nothing happy
to say than, "they loved us."

In his hand was the love Todt few herbs, a bouquet of flowers key,
Chamomillen, lemon balm, nettles white, and orange leaves
Lindenblüthe .-- A monthly rose, which she long maintained, bloomed
in a basket at her side .-- The whole Talking Flowers Ceiling the
coffin was a green Epheuranke just above, which crosses to the heads
of the coffin to hinanrankend said "green is always my loyal, who
wants to separate me from my love, I believe him and let him not.

             Who is loyal than me?

themselves of the root separately, I do not by what I hugged, and green
and live clinging to my support. umschließet Green With eternal
loyalty the ashes of Todt and binds the pieces of the urn; torn
because it would die.

Even the fallen trunk I umgrüne. Since I live, I ring up, not on its own
merits, but driven by courteous grace, which I appreciate the roots
of my classes because I covers .-- Merciful clothe the naked rock,
decket the eternal love and my own Armuth carry me up with the
merciful, blessed it speaks; that I rise from the desert, having
regard to the over-flowing love of happy. "- Those and many others
were born the flowers and herbs, which the spirits of the grateful
arms, where Mrs.

Urhinkel all Mercy had proved their coffin adorned anew. - When
she had adorned the coffin, they moved to either side of the woman
Urhinkel back, raised their flags again and appeared in the background.
Everything looked Gockel, Hinkel, Gackeleia Kronovus very quietly
and with deep emotion and now Gackeleia said: "So is the beautiful
flowers of our coffin of the ancestress you told me so often dear
mother that the flowers to the angels in heaven garden picked?"

- since erwiederte Mrs.

Hinkel: "Yes, and he is much nicer than I knew, because the angels
were the poor, in the sky guided by their love of gardening and the
sky was the garden of her lovingly merciful action, and all the
flowers and herbs were their love works.

You By the grace of God even built her garden! "- Gockel said:" Here,
you can probably tell, our deeds follow us, and how one of sorrow
and evil says, this is a nail in my coffin, you can probably All
works of love say they are flowers on my grave, o who should not
be such a garden to build !"

--" wish Ah, "said Kronovus," thou must help Gackeleia, we want to work
diligently in the garden. " Gackeleia had Thränen in the eyes and
nodded silently. So they stood and saw the body of the ancestress
of the grave and reverend, and yet so sweetly with his wedding in
the flower bed rested. No trace of putrefaction disfigured the
touching figure. She was quite the same as it was in the room
count in Gockelsruh bridal gemalt saw only wise, yet pure. The noble,
wise, the main Graf crown over a wreath of amaranth, the rich with
pearls durchflochtenen Lockenhaus umfieng and rested with geschloßnen
eyes as the face of a sleeping child, heroes, on a round golden,
ornamented with rubies Pads, they like a saint sham shone, the one
cheek, but declined slightly tilted to the side of a pillow from
the finest pure white canvas .-- "Do you know the little pillows?"

asked the woman Hinkel Gackeleia and replied: "o certainly, of which
thou hast indeed told me, as the coffin, flowers, and the Countess
of Hainault Amey fascinating so fine, so fine, wove so fine, so
fine, and dried their linen Thränen of the poor, but because no
matter how finely spun, but finally ways; the point to the sun, so
you have the poor of this linen in the sun with gratitude Thränen
bleached. theilte but you all with them and so does this linen;
since then have the grateful arms Theil her from her bridal Todtenhemd
shirt and a sewn, and there's a little bit left, it manufactures
small pillow and sewed it to the acquittal.

"A good conscience is the quietest of pillows." It all came Vögelein,
which they of youth on their crumbs ausgestreut had used and plucks
himself from the most tender gratitude downy feather from the breast
into the pillow until it is quite soft and richly filled.

These gifts of love they revered as a bridal gift Wohlthäterin and
they took her with flowers in the coffin ."--" You know everything
is still beautiful, "Mrs. erwiederte Hinkel," see, in memory of
this honorable event as have also all virgins and women of our
tribal facilities in its two such shirts and such a small pillow,
which manufactures the poor need to be and this portion of the
equipment is called the poor-linen-Spiegelgabe because we are at
the mildness of our ancestress to reflect. "" Ah, "said Gackeleia,
"it is difficult to view from the love face to disconnect, it is
so venerable, so serious as Sybille what fates dreams so lovingly
caring and warned as a pious mother, and on the forehead rests the
spirit of peace defeated Leiden and if I'm very moved and Thränen
me in the eyes will want to smile at me her cheeks and her lips so
childish and it is contrary to me, kisses me as a child of the
Thränen eyes and comforting to me to emphasize the curls forehead.
"- Gockel said:" Child, you have a good safe Aug, what you say,
must have been Seyn.

Sieh, so has the affectionate heart, the good ancestress even as the
Virgin Hennegauschen Mägdlein-Order-of pious children gladly
donated, its highest level here in the coffin covered her chest.

It is the same Order, the mother Hinkel and also you are wearing now.
It was in the days of good ancestress Hainault in the country
under the female sex a sad thoughtful devotional manner indented;
wanted the egg Seyn wiser than the chicken and the chicken said surprising
applied a lot about eggs. It was like a disease among Mägdlein the
country, all handmade and nursing women as well as all the joy and
laughter to abdicate and itself a deeply perceptive Hinbrüten to
show on which some things were very wrong .-- Now in 1310 Porette
, a maiden from Hainault, which the countess knew Amey, by this
way of life in such nonsensical opinions and teachings was that
they live in Paris to fire death verurtheilt promised, Countess
Amey took this to heart so that they decided that their Verkehrte
example, contrary to work.

They built it for the Order of Virgins joyful devout children, in which
all her friends she made mandatory, with work and care for the poor,
childlike joy and devotion to unite. All the best and had a holy
altar in her heart, and everything Kindliche Heitere but also a
hospitable hostel is free, and then came the love Amey in a rather
charming, natural beings.

It was the consolation of the poor and the joy of the children, they
called themselves the Order Großmeisterinn as the poor child of
Hainault.

Since the start of a good time for the children in Hainault,
which by the exaggerated self their mothers and older sisters
totally unobserved, desolate, dirty, torn and ragged had become. The
love Amey built large religious festivals, and each of their
Ordensgespielinnen had to Heerde children dressed in clean and neat
on the grassland, where danced and played, ate and drank and thanked
God was.

All noble virgins wanted in the Order of the children joyfully pious
Seyn, and the custom of female received a nice new twist, so that
it became a proverb: "How well would I would I to the woman a 'noble
Dirn from Hainault!"

But the combination of piety and joyful childishness to describe,
to express the deepest that it does not look much further brings
lallendes as a child, there is the religious character of a figure
which on the one side to the sun than auffliegendes Lerchlein joyful
viewing the image on the other hand, a small, winding smiling child
who is patiently from one arm to the other can take, imagining.

It is this order but in a amaranthrothen, with all sorts of bells and
Quästchen and seven Sächelchen behängten band worn around the
neck, because the Amaranth does not wither and their deep red color
is dried preserved.

The amaranth is a symbol of faithful, resistant God - and people love,
and a beloved jewelry Todt, and it was the poor child of Hainault
Blumenbettlein here in the beautiful Amaranthenkrone up because it is
legally changed. The earth bears only the shadow of this flower,
the sky alone puts them in the fullness of their whole meaning
really clear, as an imperishable, unpolluted, unverwelkliches Erbtheil
to us in it is preserved. - The Amaranth is a symbol of innocent
children, because these by the sword of life separately, in their
blood in the sky like the deep red glow Amaranth, which is itself
cut off from the plant, do not lose their color .-- The Amaranth
is a symbol of resistance, endurance of the faithful, and it states
that, in cold and heat, separate resistant, never wilting in Thränen
erneuet properties .-- This helps because the Countess Amey Amaranth
Crown and the Order on amaranthrothen band; but that at the hem of
this serious band like all the little toys, tassels, bells, Troddeln
hang signs again innocent joy at the hem of the serious Tagwerker,
as the beds of a garden, which we laboriously build, with lovely
little flowers are bordered.

Sieh Gackeleia because of the profound importance of Amaranthenfarbe
had the good ancestress also probably such a deep emotion in their
sight because they could not often hold back when they saw this
color, or arose from the power of this paint on them from a
presentiment of fate, it by the same imminent?

             - I can not decide - I must just warn you, dear Gackeleia, never a
Hinneigung to any matter to be too fierce, so that they do not
finally overwhelm, because look - the good ancestress was caught
by this color and from Hainault hieher after Gockelsruh abducted.

The robbers, who knew that they comply with this color are not able to
spread on a green meadow, where they often walk greedily, a amaranthfarbige,
silk blanket, and sang a song in the vicinity, which they are very
loved: "Fire Blümelein Rothe , jumps from the blood of the sham, From
the Earth urges the wine, Roth swinging my Fähnelein. "This song attracted
Amey to the window and as the deep-red spot in the evening glow on the
lawn sparkle saw, she could not play the craving is, they hineilen
had, and to set the ceiling down, and so they entschlummerte. As the
robbers withdrew with hidden cords suddenly the blanket over her, tied
to a horse and kidnapped them up under the hen hieher Linde,
Urgockel where they freed her Hülfsgeschrei .-- Look, it's all in
a wide amaranthseidenes robe wrapped, indicates that the ceiling,
in which they kidnapped, rescued, and the bride was Urgockels. "-"
It fits quite nicely, "said Gackeleia now that" they that color
here in the death of bears, because it is also in this Color kidnapped
from the Earth, and the true cross hen rescued, a bride of heaven
and like a cake under the wings of a hen gathers been .-- But say,
why have since the robbers kidnapped the lovely ancestress want -
but you see not so reichgeschmückt like other countesses, the
glittering jewelery bursting, and I have been puzzled about this
Armuth, you can probably tell me, why did they have no other jewelry
on their wedding amaranthseidenen than just two little gems on the
two clips, which the vast robe on the shoulders together?

"- Since the Gackeleia looked Gockel smiling and said:" Right
you're a rogue, you ask me of all kinds, which is long forgotten, and
then turn you in secret Salomonis the ring, so to me All in the mind
is what I never or only dark but had known ."--" Of course I make
it so, "replied Gackeleia," because like any dish has its peculiar
vascular, then such old stories always at its most beautiful when
she tells the father. "- As Gockel went on:" You are quite right
to ask for the robbers, they kidnapped and gems on these solitary
axillary their belts at the same time, because of this because the
robbers wanted what evil nobles from the Turgau were, they kidnap
and Kronovus like you only good guard, otherwise you may as well
go there, because you are wearing those two little gems on the
golden tighteners, the sleeves of your wedding amaranthfarbigen on
the shoulder aprons, and these are the actual clips you Morgengabe
what belongs to you alone.

There are the so-called back-sacred gems of the county Vadutz,
whose coat of arms that is entrenched. Vadutz with his Felsenschlößern
is a Frauenlehn and heard all the firstborn of countesses Hainault,
with these clips, all rights of a Lehnshuldinn of Vadutz received.

There is an old mysterious legend associated with these stones, it
means that the true, holy graces, gems, Rebecka already have on
their shoulders, they seyen wunderthätig, the ancestress did they
put into the grave, to their offspring against danger to guard
against , and those which they bear, seyen ordinary stones; the mag
well so Seyn because Hinkel mother also wore these gems since she
became Countess of Vadutz, but I have thus never see miracles.

However, the gems, which the Countess Amey her daughter to the Countess
of Vadutz inaugurated and which is now up on your shoulders have
come to the outlaw gems have been touched and may be a ray of their
blessings received.

The holy outlaw Lehne gems, but we see here on the tighteners
ancestress of love, and in the great book, which is here next to
her in the coffin is, is of the secrets of these stones, we want it
now after the wedding meal read, but you now their preference with
the message, as these jewels and the Ländchen Vadutz to countesses
of Hainault come .-- The father of the love these little gems
ancestress bore himself, he was a hereditary Count of Vadutz, married
but with a Countess of Hainault, moved with the jewels after Hainault
and took its name.

He longed long for a daughter, now his wife as the love Amey born, it
was just New Year's Day, the Count of Hainault was in the castle chapel
and at the moment as we sang: "We are born one Kindelein, rejects
His kingdom on the shoulders his.

"came a page gone, he should fast to the woman, the Countess, so
just gave it the Klapperstorch a allerliebsten Töchterchen brought.

As the count ran quickly up into the room of the countess and sang
all the way: "I was born a daughter, rejects His kingdom on his
shoulders," and when he came up, the countess was sitting upright
on their stock and had the love , poor child of Hainault at heart,
and the count was quite beside himself with joy and leaned his head
on the shoulder of the mother and daughter saw the love in the eyes
and potted Freudenthränen, then took his arm bands, whereupon two
gems, the Reichskleinode of Vadutz, befestiget were solemnly and
said, "because we love the little daughter just bescheert been since
you sang Versch, so I want him his kingdom to his lean shoulders
and now you, as his loyal Vormünderin."

As he tacked his wife with the shoulder straps the precious gems, whereupon
the arms of Vadutz was incised on the shoulders and said: "I collateral
through you your firstborn firstborn daughters and all their descendants
with the Ländchen Vadutz it an sey Frauenlehn, a Kunkellehn in our
descendants, and will be the firstborn daughters of the Count of
Hainault, when the first tender Kunkel of flax for the poor, without
tearing up the thread, abgesponnen have these gems on the shoulders
and stapled them to be mortgaged Ländchen Vadutz . '- you now, dear
Gackeleia, now wearing these jewels on your arm bands.

The old Count of Hainault said nothing about the origin and the graces
of these jewels, which his ancestors already had been forgotten, but
which later ancestress of three women learned monastery, which they
pay Lilienthal founded a monastery, there are the same, which there
beside the lilies at her .-- Because these are gems, and now the
possession of the county Vadutz kidnapped some knights, which are
not governed from abroad wanted to be the Lehnshuldin and have been
slain here by Urgockel.

"This Gackeleia silent for a while, and Gockel because they asked,
"why do not you speak?"

she replied, in which he is a spindle full of the finest Gespinnstes
enough: "Ah father, because I do not rock those abgesponnen refused
me the Ländchen so hard on the shoulders as unjust Good as I turned
the ring Salomonis quick, quick as a finger on the spindle and since
I have now full of fine yarn for the poor and it is very easy for me
again on the shoulders.

"Because they all were smiling on the conscientiousness of the new
Queen Gackeleia from Gelnhausen, Gockelsruh and Countess of Hainault,
Lehnshuldin of Vadutz and watched the lovely ancestress continued.

The golden bracelets, which was once the wide sleeves firmly
attached, were going to the poor, arid herabgesunken, the fine
white hands rested on both sides of the womb. The Left, the above
herbs, the rights rested on a large book and took eight long
amaranthfarbige, ribbons embroidered with pearls, which of the
similar belt expired, the long robe over the hips enclosed.

At this belt were also key and a spoon, children to feed and a
rattle, Scheer and similar. hagern fine feet looked so poor and
touching the hem of the robe shows as they trembled, and embroidered
with pearls Goldpantöffelchen had become too far, and one fell down
so that one foot with the gleaming white toes hervorsah. - Since
Gackeleia knelt with great love and emotion in the coffin down and
kissed the foot and wetted it with Thränen, with the words: "you
poor dear child of Hainault've lost your slippers, o mother Hinkel
see how love must be the Ahnfrauchen to the poor in the snow
herumgepatscht Seyn the top of the foot is brown, it has the feet
verfroren, - wait, I know what I Thue, in the golden Gallina the
Queen of Sheba is a frost ointment, they hollow me Kronovus "- DC
Kronovus brought the ointment and she used the foot of Todt so loved
and looked Thränen with the father and said:" Father Gockel, the
love child of poor Hainault Todt's been a long time, but I may be
but Maintain, do not you Father, this is not entirely unreasonable?

because see, I must thun it out of love and gratitude, and I would
be ashamed of, so I do not Thäter, I Thue with the wishes, it thun
themselves, they will already know what they can use it, maybe they
can now that I've proved her love, a lot of fun in paradise garden
herumtrippeln, and thanked me there. "- In these words Gackeleia
kissed the foot, which they maintained and only a mere handkerchief
was connected and put him back into the slippers, then raised it
and they all hugged in silence, and it sounded from the spirit of
the woman Urhinkel with intense joy of her singing: "My pain was
mild, a thousand thanks!

Lieb forever to heal, which sick time, Take your love to wage The
outlaw stones of Vadutz; In the big book you know how beneficial
this Gnadenputz; O star and flower, spirit and dress, love, suffering
and time and eternity!

"It was a shimmering delight in appearance and the three wise
Nönnchen with the lilies, the perfume sweeter than ever .-- Gackeleia
bethought itself but not for long, quickly interchanged their armpits
tighteners with those of a poor child of Hainault, and took both
the big book from the coffin and gave it to the father .-- Gockel
scrolls a little and then said: "It is curious written by both sides
after the middle.

From one side to comply with the accounts of the county Vadutz,
from a diary the other one thousand .-- Potz !

which are as fiefs and interest therein, but - but err is human, the
child has also given once charged. Here on this sheet in the alms-bill
rate was subtrahiren to 1 in 100 is 99, but she has Instead, I said,
1 out of 100 I can not, 1 in 10 remains from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on
9 goes - the impossible can happen, but it's worked out but, as seeds
in the garden of the poor .-- In the orthography, it was also not
quite find here in the daily housekeeping bill is always a degree
Michl, a pint Michl, Michl always take milk, but, since little ways;
the point, which must now be read, read Gackeleia!

" and he gave her the book and read it: Gräflich Hainault chickens -
and human statues to the cause of eternal memory. We by the grace of
God Countess Amey, Urhinkel of Hainaut, first Lehnshuldin of
Ländchens Vadutz, poor child of Hainault and the Order of joyful
children pious founder, explained in a high punctuality, punctuality
and decimal cum Duopünktlichkeit .-- When we, the abysmal shoal
exaggerated Beschaulichkeit to meet our established order, we have
our family name and first Ordensgespielinnen for different reason,
which in the diaries of the year 1318 are down, many graces and
rights for themselves and their female offspring awarded, while the
funeral procession and each Brautzug Countess of Hainault a descendant
of this Gespielinnen cautious and keep a chicken in the so-called
chicken dinner has deliver.

Also the same cadaver Brautund such trains with their names designating
flowers and attend such flowers at the foot of the tomb preserved,
with the childlike love of opinion, then they want to take her to
pray, even if they could not present Seyn .-- Each offspring of my
firstborn daughter notes with their mature years, the Office of
Ordensgeneralin and the title: "the poor child of Hainault" and has
on its belt as a corpse bride and eight volumes of amaranthfarbigem
Linne Band befestiget which Ordensgespielinnen touch, if they follow
the course.

The deep silence was broken only by the rippling of
the Nancon, by the regular and lugubrious tolling from the belfries,
by the heavy steps of the sentinels or the rattle of arms as the guard
was hourly relieved.

"The night's as thick as a wolf's jaw," said the voice of Pille-Miche.

"Go on," growled Marche-a-Terre, "and don't talk more than a dead
dog."

"I'm hardly breathing," said the Chouan.

- What works ... What works? - Men in Chamberí ... my asylum ... Are
you parallel - Ah! Mrs forgive ... when I heard the piece, I thought
that was soon to a literary work. - If you can not travel, use
two. - or three, or four ... liked it a lot ...

If need be, of course, travel as many bricks ... - And if I do well
the message, with an almost new fungus ...

I have a house yesterday, and I reserve for friends who help me do
that ... what would you do? Today for you tomorrow for me. Oops,
abura, abura.

Ido and his wife met in deshacían and the ladies were escorted to
the front door. In the streets of Toledo Simon took them to save time,
and blessed Ido went to meet the mandate that the founder had done. It
was not a mission _delicada_ certainly, as he wished, but the
principle of charity involved in that act of the trocar into vulgar
sublime.

The whole afternoon was my holy man occupied in transporting the
bricks, and was pleased that not one of the seventies he broke down
the road. The contentment that filled his soul away weariness, and his
joy came almost exclusively from Jacinta who, at that bit
where he took apart, had given him a hard. He did not put the coin in
his vest pocket, where it would have discovered Nicanor, but at the
waist, very well hidden in a belt attached to using the meat to warm the
mouth of the stomach. Why should fix things ... that hard, given
separately, famished eyes away from the rest of the family, was
exclusively for him.

Such had been the intention of the lady, and D. Joseph believed would
offend their benefactors interpreted differently. Keep therefore
his treasure, and worth of all traces of their ingenuity to defend
it from the eyes and nails of Nicanor ... because if this is
discovered, Holy Christ of the Guards ...

He spent the night in great uneasiness. I was afraid that his wife
discovered the insightful eye Matute he locked in his waistband.

The fucking seemed to smell the silver. That's why he was so Azores and
were not assured in any position, believing that through the clothes
you are going to see the coin.
Corentin, walking up and down the esplanade had too practiced an ear
not to hear the rustling of the shrubs and the light sound of pebbles
rolling down the sides of the precipice. Marche-a-Terre, who seemed to
possess the gift of seeing in darkness, and whose senses, continually
in action, were acute as those of a savage, saw Corentin; like a
trained dog he had scented him. Fouche's diplomatist listened but
heard nothing; he looked at the natural wall of rock and saw no signs.
If the confusing gleam of the fog enabled him to see, here and there,
a crouching Chouan, he took him, no doubt, for a fragment of rock, for
these human bodies had all the appearance of inert nature. This danger
to the invaders was of short duration. Corentin's attention was
diverted by a very distinct noise coming from the other end of the
Promenade, where the rock wall ended and a steep descent leading down
to the Queen's Staircase began. They have recognized his voice and was
hinabgeeilt to him to open it. He was not alone, but only four other
men with him, one with a coat covered stretcher into the room had
established.

The father had the mantle back beaten and ordered her to shine, but
was violently shocked, because a bleeding, almost dead on the grave was
located. The father had told her the room to warm up quickly, however,
had the wounded man, whom she referred to his clothes to make Mr
detected had placed on the bed.

The father told him his wounds combined with herbs, then he had himself
prepares a potion, because he understood to be excellent drugs for
animals and humans.

For two days they were all worried, because the Junker had gerast and
getobt. After the second Tränklein but he was quiet, the father
had said that on the eighth morning he will wake up fresh and healthy,
and really it was also arrived.

The young man had with growing astonishment of the speech of the girl
listened. He had often to interrupt, if it is not their delicate
expressions quite understood, or if they abschweifte in her speech to
the herbs to describe what the Pfeifer Hardt was preparing his
medicines.

"And your father," he asked them, "Where is he?" "What I know where he
is!"

she replied evasively, but when do they look a lot, she added: "jo
Uich comb saga, because your good friend müesset be with em Father.

He is Lichtastoi." "According to Lichtenstein?" cried George, by his
colored cheeks higher. "And when he comes back?" "Yes he Sottens
shows since zwoi days do not matter how hot its gsait. If no g'scheha
nix is. D'Leut say that bündische tab basse uff." According to
Lichtenstein - there was it was also him. He felt strong enough again
to dare a ride and the failure of nine days catch. His next and most
important question was, therefore, after his horse.

And when he heard that it is very well-being and sleep in the cowshed
of his care, was also the last of his grief diminished. He
thanked his nurse Holden for his service and asked them about his
doublet and his coat.

She had long since all traces of blood and sword blows from the
beautiful robes vertilgt; courtesy bustle, it noted the effects
of the Junkers from the carved and painted shrine, where they are
next to her Sunday jewelry had rested.

Smiling spread they play pieces in front of him and his praise
seemed that they all so beautiful, so happy to hear that.

Then they enteilte the chamber, the glad tidings that the Junker is
completely cured, the parent to convey.

Chapter 16 As a woman and the round of Bärbel herabstiegen the
chamber floor, was their first course in the chamber, where her
guest was, but after cooking, and for two reasons: firstly, because
the guest is now a strong Hafermus had to be cooked, and then -
from the kitchen was a small window into the room, there arose the
mother to the faces of the Junkers to rekognoszieren.

Bärbel turned on the toes and watched her mother on the shoulder
through Fensterlein. They marveled, and tapped her heart since
the age of seventeen for the first time rather impetuous, because as
pretty but it had not thought the Junker. She was often by his vision
to have been moved to tears when he staring eyes, without
consciousness, almost without life there was.

His pale, still struggle with the death trains were so beautiful they
are often dressed as a touching, sublime image of the devout praying
attracts a sense. But now, she felt it, now it was something quite
different. The eyes were again filled by a beautiful, brave fire
and it wanted the Baerbel bedünken on the toes, as they did, they
become so old, yet no such view.

The hair was no longer in untidy strands to the beautiful forehead.
It was orderly and well at the neck down.

His cheeks had reddened again, his lips were so fresh as the cherries
at Peter and Paul. And like him seidengestickte doublet well dressed,
and the broad white neck collar, on which he laid out the dress was!
But the girl could not fathom why he will always return to one of
white and blue woven silk sash was down.

So, so eagerly, as if mysterious characters interwoven, which he tried
to decipher it. Yes, it was her even before, when he hit the field
to bind the heart, as he leads them to the lips full devotion and
fervor, as one relics to worship cultivates.

The round woman, however, had their research by the Fensterlein ended.
" 's is like a Mr.

Prince na," she said, using the Hafermus umrührte.

"Was he a has a dewlap! Dia Herra z'Stuagert et Kennet's beautiful hau.
What he no duet with Fetza, won it in the hot hand? He looks almost
as a ausenander! It is, ka was a Bluat na come till that ens

convenient than the room could see. "But know it, Muater, wia mers
fürkommt? He does so even fuirige auga druf na Sell is certainly
Ebbesen Seim of treasure.

"The round woman could not contain the correct suspect their child
to smile a little, but she quickly took her mother's dignity back
together, they replied:" A what you WOist estimation!

So na child like you do a muaß nix so Denka.

Gang now away from Fensterle there Häfele sell me long ago. The
Lord we fürnehmes a Fressa g'wohnt was, i am a muaß till much lard
in de mash dauh.

"Bärbel left the window a bit vulnerable. They knew that their mother
should not be contradictory, but this had apparently wrong.

The breakfast of the Junkers was finished, however, it lacked nothing
more than a good old cup wine.

This was soon brought, as the Pipers Hardt was a small man, but not
so poor that he did not for a solemn opportunity to try a barrel
in Keller had lie.

The girl carried the wine and bread, and the woman went round in
full Sunday, the bowl with Hafermus in both fists, her daughter
Holden forward into the room.

It cost the young man no small effort, the many Knixen Pfeifer stopped
the woman to do. They had in their youth return to the castle to
Neuffen serve and knew what life was. Therefore, she stayed with
the smoking bowl at their own threshold, pending her strict Junker
seriously ordered vorzutreten.

The daughter but stood behind the blushing round woman, and her bashful
face was visible only at moments when the mother is quite deeply
bowed.

They made the deal of Knixe number, but they do not want to be extremely
deferential because they had already half a hour chatting with him.
The girl, now covered the table with fresh linen, put the Junker
the Hafermus and wine at the place of honor in the corner of the bank
under the crucifix. Then they have a delicate carved wooden spoons
in the Mus. He remained to stand upright, and it was a good sign
that prepares the breakfast was delicious. When the Junker is established
had also put the mother and daughter to the table their Suppennapf,
but in modest distance, and not without Salzfaß between themselves
and their guests to make. For if it wanted the custom in the good old
times. George had, while the Frühmal eating, leisure enough, the two
women to consider. He confessed that, the glory of the house Pfeifer
Hardt was a handsome woman, perhaps some less bold man as his leader
and Savior under the stilts of their heavy shoes (slippers, she had
probably not) would have. The child's eyes in the game him a lovely
lass, and a so-pretty head, such Yours eyes were perhaps his heart
in a not despise Area won, it would not be of an image already been
completely fulfilled, the gap would not be so infinitely great, the
relationship between birth and the heirs of the name spring storm and
the small daughter of Pfeifer Hardt had fastened. Nevertheless,
his eyes rested with pleasure on their pure, innocent trains, and
would be the round woman with her soup was too busy, so it probably
would not have escaped the redness, on the cheeks of her child
ascended, when randomly one of its stealthy glances of the eye of the
young man met. "The bowl is empty, now it's time to talk." This award
was also right here as soon as the tablecloth was removed. Georg were
mainly two things at heart: He certainly had his when the Pfeifer von
Lichtenstein would come back because he's only news about the
mistress wanted to wait, and then immediately rush to her.

And secondly, it was very important to know where the federal army
at this moment is.

About the former, he could receive no further information than what
the girl he previously had said.

The father was around for six days away, but promised, on the fifth
evening, again to be here, and they therefore expected him hourly
The round woman potted tears by the Junker complained that her
husband, since this war began, barely a few hours at home had been.

He was of bleaker times already her as a restless man notorious.

Now people murmur again all over him, and certainly bring his wife and
his child by his dangerous life in unhappiness and misery.

George looked at all the reasons consolation in order to breastfeed
her tears. He succeeded at least so far that she answer his questions
after Bundesheer replied. "Oh, Lord," she said, "is of a gray and
a Jomer.

'S grad, as if the wild huntsman uf de Wólka rides g'schpenstige and
with his dog over the stock moving. 'S quite Unterland
counterparties schau se, and now goht's hella Haufe em ge Tibenga.
"" So are all the forts already in her hand? " Georg asked puzzled.
"Light rock, Schorndorf, Göppingen, Teck, Urach? Are they all been
taken?" Aellen counterparties A man se vo Schorndorf's hot g'sait
that se de Hellastoi, Schorndorf Göppinga and counterparties. But by
Teck and Aurich kan e Uich quite gnau berichta, mer jo Koine send
three or four hours DAVO. " She told Now: On the third April was
before the army pulled Teck. They had a part of the infantry before
a gate and with the crew on the transfer were discussed. As are all
servants to this gate geeilt and have listened, and, however, was
the gate of the other enemies have been climbed.

The Castle Urach but four hundred duke had been Fußknechte. The
citizenship have not in the city to leave when the enemy anrückte.

It was the battle between them was what the servants on the market were
pushed, but there was the bailiff by a bullet and later with
halberds niedergestoßen been.

The city has revealed the federal government. "It is miracle
koi," concluded the woman round her story, "Aellen Burga and castles
suppose se ei. Because se counterparties long Feldschlanga and
Bombardierstuck where se Kugla draus schießet, graißer than my head,
that Maura zema Brecha Aellen Aellen and Tirn einfalla müaßet.

"George was after this report, knowing that a trip from Hardt
Lichtenstein after no less dangerous than that will ride over the
Alps, because he had the straight line between Urach and Tübingen
throat.

But since Urach several days by the army to leave. The Siege of Tübingen
team had needed a lot of demand, and so George could still hope
that there is no actual line item the country's more, he had to
pass through, would be filled.

With so he eagerly awaited the arrival of his leader.

His head wound was healed. She was not deep, because the feathers of
his beret and his thick hair had the blow, which led to him had been
taken his sharpness.

But the strike was still strong enough to turn it on so many
days to deprive of consciousness. Also other wounds on his arm and legs
were healed, and the only physical consequence of that unfortunate
night was a weariness, he presented to the blood loss, the long benches
and Wundfieber excessive. But even these disappeared from hour to
hour, because a fresh courage and yearning thoughts into the distance
soon chased even such terrible people. He also had the good-natured
confidential loquaciousness admire the girl.

The round woman liked diminish as they wanted, liked them so often
admonish, the high status of the knight to remember, they did not
take their guests to entertain, especially because they are secret
plan to investigate whether they are in terms Binding of the field
had better advised than the mother, had not yet abandoned.

She had this very special nor their thoughts.

As Junker namely the ill did so, was it at night for a long
aufgeblieben to the father to society, on the bed of the wounded
watched.

But they soon fell asleep over her work. It liked about ten clock in
the night, since it carries a noise in the room was bright. They
saw a man with the father pressing speak his lines not escaped
her, though he is in a large cap had wrapped it believed a servant
of the knight of Lichtenstein, who has often been attributed to
mysterious way to the Pfeifer Hardt came and whose presence she
always had to leave the room need to recognize in him.

Curious, for once to hear what this man with the father to do, they
shut their eyes firmly back on, because it probably was her that
her father she only in the room was because he held on firmly asleep.

The man told by a lady who has a certain message was inconsolable.

You have the strange man and asked gefleht, according to Hardt and
recovered message that she had sworn that if he does not bring
good news, her father to say everything, and to care for the sick
even to come.

Such Lichtenstein had secretly talked, the father had complained to
the lady, the courier had the whole state of health stories and
promised that he, as soon as the patient had improved, even come
to the lady to bring this consolation.

The third man had then the patient Löckchen one of his long hair
cut it in a cloth and beaten under the doublet probably keeps; that
he was, led by the father, gone from the room, and shortly afterwards
she heard him at night and fog Wegreiten again.

This story had many affairs of the next day be back soon from the
light, youthful spirit of the daughter of Pfeifer Hardt ousted, but
now they woke up a new, excited by what Bärbel through the kitchen
window had seen.

They knew that the Knight of Lichtenstein had a daughter, because
the sister's of the game was their nurse.

And this lady had to be, the servant sent Lichtenstein have to be
pressing for the sick to find that even wanted to come to him to
maintain. Tears came into her eyes usually so cheerful, as they
thought, how easily the Junker his Liebchen wegsterben can have,
and how they are lonely and so would have been without love, and
yet she was certainly right to make and a nice rich knight child.

But is not the Junker much worse about it? thought that kind Schwabenland
child; the girl's father has now brought news of him, but he knew
it for many days no word of it, because once he knew nothing of
himself, and again since he was in life, He could also not know,
so he probably had the bandage, which he certainly had it, then
viewed and moved to the heart and the lips?

She took the right, to tell him what had proceeded that night, maybe it
is a consolation to him, she thought.

She trembled violently
and raised her eyes to the cross on the altar.

"A saint at last," said Francine, in a low voice.

At that time my father still lived, I had a gentle, good mother and a
very small Schwesterlein.

We both always happy when Friday came, we knew nothing of the
significance of the day, but we then calculated that it has only two
days until Easter was where our mother brought beautiful things.
Requiescant in peace, "he added more seriously, he looked sideways
in order to hide a tear."

They are over all three and then celebrate their holy Friday. ""
One should not speak so unholy things, "said Pfeifer after some
silence, "but my Beichtiger like it already forgiven me. I think you
should not be sad, Junker! Those who sleep, it is, and those who
watch will be forward and not look backward. I would rate your body
to remember how you once your child and the Easter upon you and how
they will look on Good Friday.

Are you not on the bridal journey, and a certain lady is not even
a good, gentle mother to be.

"George looked a smile in vain to suppress, the consolation award this
weird hervorgelockt had." Listen, dear friend, "replied he," you
is Not to allow such a word, but I would not advise others, my ears
by such sinful thoughts to desecrate. "ungut for Nothing, Sir! I wanted
neither you nor the lady so offend, will also no longer happen. But
you see there is not already the tower rising from the tops? Even a
small quarter, and we are top. "" So much yesterday, I notice at night,
is the castle on a single, sharp rocks hinausgestellt?

By God, a bold idea, because nobody could hinüberkommen who does not
comply with the vultures in the covenant was, and had learned to
fly, now admittedly, they could add a shot to pieces. "" Do you?
Well, there are also four good double hooks in the hall, including a
word answer would be. If you've seen in so you must have noticed
that the rock around a wide valley of the mountains around separately
is, is where you could not do much damage, the only page that is
located closer to the mountain is where the herübergeht drawbridge.

Once planted gun on there and see that whether you are the Lichtenstein
not included in the basic shoot, before you only a window onto seeds
have made. And how do you lead-up gun in these canyons and mountains,
without you that a few resolute men do more harm than the whole nest
is worth? "" Since you have right, "George replied," I would like
to know who had the idea has, on the rocks to build a castle. ""
I will tell you, "replied the musician, with all the legends of his
country was" once lived there many years ago a woman who had to
tolerate a lot of persecution and knew that no more guessing.

Since she came to this rock and saw a huge vulture with his family
and all the household and lived there, after all was safe.

child Püppchen bet and then, who can both of them Sweet: "please,
please say that Mom can not beat.

At that instant it was darkened by a thickset figure, and a hoarse
voice, known to Francine, said in a whisper, "Make haste, general,
those rascally Blues are stirring."

Acisclo. In the solitude of his room for hours and hours spent
reading and writing.

Not surprisingly modest, do not expect that, since the public was very
useful, yet wrote an extensive piece of not lifting hand.
Seeing that his wife had put on his clothes, he
tried to detain her; but she tore herself roughly from his arms and he
was forced to descend. It was also the rumor that the Federal stalls
were quickly broken up by Nördlingen, each in his hometown geeilt
to fresh armies aufzubieten and Ulrich for the second time to life
and death combat.

Ulrich himself seemed neither the one nor the other of these concerns
to give space.

He pflog with closed doors with Ambrose Volland Council Couriers Man saw
many come and go off, but no one heard what they said. In
Stuttgart, but firmly believed, should the Duke in his merriest mood,
because if he and his brilliant retinue rode through the streets, all
the beautiful virgins and greeted the men at his side, joked and laughed
as they said: "Mr.

Ulrich is back as funny as before poor Konrad. " He had his court again
brilliantly set up.

Although he was no longer as before the assembly of the Bavarian,
Swabian and Franconian Counts and gentlemen, although the princess was
missing, otherwise a beautiful wreath of blossoming young lady had
to be gathered, but there is no shortage of beautiful women and
pretty noble, his court to glorify, and the air of this city seemed
even then the beauty so cheap to be that the colored lines in the
rooms and halls of the castle is not an ordinary meeting, but a
selection of beautiful women in the country compared. dances and
games were knights in their old rights have been set up.

Fixed urged to feast, and Ulrich seemed eager to want to do
what he at the time of his accident, had failed. None of these
festivals was the smallest wedding Georgs storm of spring
with the heiress of Lichtenstein. The old gentleman had not long
to decide, to keep his word.

Not that his options would have disapproved of his daughter because
he loved his fatherly Eidam, he saw in his own youth to flourish again,
he beat his voluntary exile with the Duke high. But as the horizon
of Ulrichs lucky, so was the forehead of the old man still clouds,
because he suspected that it will not stay as it was, and it pained
him deeply that the Duke in some important matter of his advice is
not used, but everything in secret with his Chancellor abhandelte.

So he had inconclusive and saddened this day of joy is always delayed,
but the beautiful eyes of his daughter, in which he is often a silent
reproach to read thought Georgs Bitten finally coerced him a certain
date.

The Duke did not take them the wedding. He liked to remember those
nights, where the father was not tired, his devotion to indicate
where the gentle daughter no storm, no refrigeration spared to him
at the gate to receive him with warm meals to refresh.

He still liked from the recent past of the victims who, he had
brought the bridegroom, he showed brilliant way he loyalty, sacrifice
and love, which he had so often proved to retaliate knew. The
knight and his daughter still have been his guests at the castle
had to Stuttgart, now he had a nice house next to the house with a
new collegiate unit, and transferred on the eve of the wedding the
key to the lady of Lichtenstein with the wish that they would like it
so often in Stuttgart was inhabiting. And finally was the day came,
which George often uncertain distance, but always with the same longing
compatriots had.

He called in the morning of that day the whole life of his love back,
he wondered how everything was so different was, as he had expected.
How would he, as he was by the Schönbuch moved after the home, can
think that the happiness, the lover not to have not so far away will
be subject, as he feared.

Every word of love came back into his memory, and he had on their
new high confidence, their belief in a beautiful kind admired skill,
they were also where the future with a düstren veil veiled, and no
prospects, no hope was not lost to them with the last Abschiedskusse
also inform him knew.
