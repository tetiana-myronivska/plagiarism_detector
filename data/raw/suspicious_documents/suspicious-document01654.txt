Before the opening of parliament, one day the Earl of Chatham stalked
into the drawing-room of St. James's, and after the levee had some
private conversation with the king. What passed between them is unknown,
but Horace Walpole says, that his reception was most flattering, and the
king all condescension and goodness. It does not appear, however, that
the interview satisfied Chatham, for it by no means tended to soften his
opposition. When parliament met, indeed, he took his place in the house
of lords, vigorous and more eloquent than ever, and the administration
was doomed to feel his power, like that of a giant refreshed with wine.

The address, which was moved in the upper house by the Duke of Ancaster,
and seconded by Lord Dun-more, was as general and unmeaning as the
king's speech. Sometimes, too, the Officers attend them when they are
sick or dying. Once they buried one of the hall in Oxford Street. It
was is about fifty worth the cost and labour of the mission,. The Officers

These had driven them into excesses which could
not be justified, but for which, he, for one, was inclined to make some
allowance. As to their combinations, and their success in supplying
themselves with goods, this, he said, had alarmed him for the commercial
interests of the mother country, but he could not conceive in what sense
they could be deemed illegal, or how the house by any declaration could
remove the evil. Other remedies must be looked for, as the discontents
of two millions of people could only be removed by a removal of their
causes. Finally, on the subject of discontent in England, he attributed
it to the proceedings of the house of commons in the matter of Mr.
As a specimen of the ruck, however, I will mention the first individual
to whom I happened to speak--a strong young man, who was weeding
a bed of onions. He told me that he had been a farm labourer in early
life, and, subsequently, for six years a coachman in a private livery
stables in London. He lost his place through drink, became a wanderer
on the Embankment, was picked up by the Salvation Army and sent to one
of its Elevator paper-works. Afterwards, he volunteered to work on the
land at Hadleigh, where he had then been employed for nine months. His
ambition was to emigrate to Canada, which, doubtless, he has now done,
or is about to do. Such cases might be duplicated by the dozen, but
for this there is no need. _Ex uno disce omnes_.

All the labour employed, however, is not of this class. For instance,
the next man to whom I spoke, who was engaged in ploughing up old cabbage
land with a pair of very useful four-year-olds, bred on the farm, was
not a Colonist but an agricultural hand, paid at the rate of wages
usual in the district. Another, who managed the tomato-houses, was a
skilled professional tomato-grower from the Channel Islands. The experience
of the managers of the Colony is that it is necessary to employ a
certain number of expert agriculturalists on the place, in order that
they may train the raw hands who come from London and elsewhere.

To a farmer, such as the present writer, a visit to Hadleigh is an
extremely interesting event, showing him, as it does, what can be done
upon cold and unkindly land by the aid of capital, intelligence, and
labour. Still I doubt whether a detailed description of all these
agricultural operations falls within the scope of a book such as that
upon which I am engaged.

Therefore, I will content myself with saying that this business, like
everything else that the Army undertakes, is carried out with great
thoroughness and considerable success. The extensive orchards are
admirably managed, and were fruitful even in the bad season of
1910.
The tomato-houses, which have recently been increased at a capital
cost of about £1,000, produce many tons of tomatoes, and the French
garden is excellent of its kind.The first principle of
the constitution is, he observed, that the subject shall not be governed
by the will of any man or body of men, but by the whole legislature, and
by certain laws to which he has given his assent: laws which were open
to him to examine, and not beyond his ability to understand. He then
denounced the late decision as destitute of every condition essential
to its legality, and as being unsupported by reason, precedent,
Magna Charta, or the Bill of Rights. Whether it be questioned by the
legislature, he continued, will depend on the resolution of the house;
but that it violates the constitution, no man who had listened to the
debate could deny. He then expressed his confidence in the wisdom and
constitutional authority of the house, and after praising the ancient
nobility as founders of the constitution, and invoking the house
to follow their brilliant example, he thus concluded:--"Those iron
barons--for so I may call them when compared with the silken barons of
modern days--were the guardians of the people; yet their virtues were

Before the declarations made by Lord-chancellor Camden in the house of
lords, his conduct had been so displeasing to his colleagues that he was
not consulted in any of their measures, and he had not even a voice in
the preparation of the king's speech. When, therefore, he stood openly
forward as an opponent of the cabinet, it was not to be expected that
the seals would be long left in his possession. The opposition knew
this, and their only fear was that he would anticipate ministers by a
spontaneous resignation, and thereby free the ministers from the odium
which they would obtain from the public by his dismissal. Camden,
however, seems to have had no thoughts of taking such a step, and
the ministers had no alternative left but to remove him from office.
Accordingly he was dismissed, and Lord Shelburne's prediction was
literally verified--the great seals went a begging. The Honourable
Charles Yorke, indeed, reluctantly accepted them, but before his patent
of peerage could be completed, he committed suicide, and the government
had to seek another chancellor. Still, they have good in for the they
