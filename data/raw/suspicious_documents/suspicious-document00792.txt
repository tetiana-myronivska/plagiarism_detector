Hundreds of days, on thousands of trips like this, the princes
of the Comstock have risked their own lives in the perils of the
yawning pits. These dark holes blown out of the mountain rocks have
their fearful death-rolls to show.

It is the revenge of the gnomes. Every detail points to a frank
explanation. Journals and reports, with letters from the Italian
consul, lifted the sad tragedy above any chance of crime or
collusion. It is kismet.

Hardin's letter was manly. In it, he pledged his honor to carry
out the agreement, advising Natalie to select a friend to accompany
her to California with the heiress, as soon as she could travel.
His banker had orders to supply funds.

"I suggest, in view of this untimely accident, you would sooner
have your funds settled on you in Europe. It shall be as you wish.
You may rely on me," so ran the closing lines.

The parted strands of the hoisting cable cannot reveal whether it
was cut or weakened, yet Hardin knows. It was his devilish masterpiece.

Days of sadness drag down the self-reliant adventuress. Whom can
she trust now? Dare she confide in Pre Franois?

A simple envelope addressed in a scrawling hand, and postmarked San
Francisco, drives all sorrow from her heart. The tiger is loosened
in her nature. She rages madly. A newspaper slip contains the
following, in flaming prominence:

"THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

"The choice of the Legislature for U. S. Senator will undoubtedly
fall upon that distinguished jurist Judge Hardin, who is now
supported by the railroad kings and leading financiers of the coast.

"It is rumored that Judge Hardin will, in the event of his election,
contract a matrimonial alliance with one of our leaders of society.
His bride will entertain extensively in the national capital."

A paper bears pithy advice:

"Come out and strike for your rights. You will find a friend to
back you up. Don't delay."

Natalie recognizes Joe Woods in this. He is the only man knowing
half the secret. Tossing on her pillow, the Queen of the El Dorado
suffers the tortures of the Inferno. Now is the time to strike
Hardin. Before the great senatorial contest. Before this cruel
marriage. She will boldly claim a secret marriage. The funds now
in the Paris bank are safe. She can blast his career. If she does
not take the heiress out, her chances vanish. And once there,
what will not Hardin do? What is Woods' motive? Jealousy. Revenge.
Hatred.

Ah, the priest! She will unbosom herself to Pre Franois. She will
urge him to accompany her and the girl to San Franciso. He will
be a "background." And his unrivalled calmness and wisdom. Pre
Franois only knows her as the "lgante" of the Champs Elyses.
She feels that Woods has been wisely discreet.

Summoning the ecclesiastic, Madame de Santos tells the story of
her claims upon Hardin.

The old Frenchman passes his rosary beads, with a clinking sound,
as he listens to the half-truths told him.

"And your child?" he queries.

"I have placed her secretly where Hardin cannot reach her. She
will be produced if needed."

There is a peculiar smile in the priest's face. "Madame, I will
accompany you on one condition."

"Name it," cries the siren, "I will furnish money, and every comfort
for you. It shall be my duty to reward you."

The priest bows gravely.

"I wish to have a resolute man with our party. My young friend,
Raoul Dauvray, has a lion's courage. Let him go with us. I do not
wish Judge Hardin to know of my presence in San Francisco. Dauvray
will guard you with his life."

"I agree to your wishes!" says madame thoughtfully. And loyal
Raoul will fight for her and his hoped-for bride. In a month there
is a notable departure from Paris. Madame de Santos, Mademoiselle
Isabel Valois, with their maids, and Raoul, "en cavalier." On the
same steamer, Pre Franois travels. He affects no intimacy with
the distinguished voyagers. His breviary takes up all his time.
Arrived at New York, Pre Franois leaves for San Francisco several
days in advance of the others.

It is singular that he goes no farther than Sacramento. The
legislature is about to assemble. Joseph Woods, as State senator,
is launched in political life. The robust miner laughs when he is
asked why he accepts these cheap honors.

"I'm not too old to learn some new tricks," he cheerfully remarks.
His questions soon exhaust Pre Franois' stock of answers.

A day's conference between the friends leads to a series of
Napoleon-like mandates of the mining Croesus. Telegraph and cable
bear abroad to the shores of the Lake of Geneva the summons which
brings Peyton, with Armand Valois and the lovely blooming "Louise
Moreau," secretly to the Pacific. Natalie knows nothing of these
pilgrims. Quietly reaching San Francisco, by a local train, Pre
Franois becomes again Padre Francisco. He rests his weary head
under the hallowing sounds of the well-remembered bells of the past
at the Mission Dolores.

Natalie de Santos rubs her eyes in wonder at the queen city of the
West, with its conquered hills and vanished sand-dunes. Whirled away
to a secure quiet retreat in a convent, selected by Pre Franois,
the heiress and her young guardian are safe from even Hardin's
wiles.

Pre Franois at New York has conferred a day with Judge Davis,
and bids his new charge be calm and trust to his own advice. Isabel
Valois is in a maze of new impressions, and bewildered by a strange
language.

Bravely attired, and of a generous port, Raoul Dauvray installs
himself in one of the palatial hotels which are the pride of the
occidental city. Colonel Joseph Woods is conspicuously absent.

When the fatigue of travel is over, Natalie de Santos quietly summons
Philip Hardin to the interview she dreads. She has been prepared
by Pre Franois for this ordeal. Yet her tiger blood leaps up in
bubbling floods. She will at last face the would-be traitor, and
upbraid him. Oh, for one resolute friend!

It is in another convent that lovely "Isabel Valois" is concealed.
The heiress longs to burst her bonds. Is not Raoul near her?
Assured of a necessity for patience, the wayward beauty bides her
time. Every day the roses she caresses, whisper to her of the ardent
lover who sighs near her in vain.

Philip Hardin steels himself to face the woman he intends to trick
and deceive at the very last. There are such things as insane
asylums in California, if she makes any hubbub.

But he has a "coup d'tat" in his mind. The old schemer will bring
Natalie to terms. Flattery first; fear afterwards.

"And they are face to face once more."


CHAPTER XIX.

LOVERS ONCE.--STRANGERS NOW.--FACE TO FACE.


Ushered into a private room, the soulless Hardin's iron nerves
fail him. His heart leaps up wildly when royal "Madame de Santos"
approaches silently. Heavens! Her startling beauty is only mellowed
with time. Another woman than the Hortense Duval of old stands
before him. A goddess.

She has grown into her new rle in life.

"Hortense!" he eagerly cries, approaching her.

"Spare me any further deceit, Philip," she coldly replies. Seating
herself, she gazes at him with flaming eyes! She is a queen at
bay!

He is startled. A declaration of war. No easy mastery now.

"Where is your charge?" Hardin queries.

"Where you will not see her, until we understand each other,"
rejoins the determined woman. Her steady glance pierces his very
soul. Memories of old days thrill his bosom.

"What do you mean by all this?" Hardin's nerve returns. He must
not yield to mortal.

The woman who queened it over his home, extends a jewelled hand
with an envelop. "Explain this," she sharply cries.

The Judge reads it. It is the announcement of his double senatorial
and matrimonial campaign.

"Is there any foundation for that report?" Madame de Santos
deliberately asks.

"There is," briefly rejoins the lawyer. He muses a moment. What
devil is awakened in her now? This is no old-time pleading suppliant.

"Then you will not see Isabel until you have settled with me and
provided the funds promised before the death of the count."

"Ah!" sneers the old advocate; "I understand you NOW, madame. Blood
money!"

"Partly," remarks Madame de Santos. "I also insist upon your giving
up this marriage."

Hardin springs from his chair. Age has robbed him of none of his
cold defiance. He will crush her.

"You dare to dream of forcing me to marry you?" His eyes have the
glitter of steel.

"You need not give up the senate, but you must marry me, privately,
and give your own child a name. Then I will leave, with the funds
you will provide. You can separate from me afterward by the mere
lapse of time. There will be no publicity needed."

"Indeed!" Hardin snarls, "A nice programme, You have had some
meddling fool advise you; some later confidant; some protector."

"Exactly so, Judge," replies the woman, her bosom heaving in scorn
and defiance. "We have lived together. We are privately married
now by law! Philip, you know the nameless girl you have never asked
for is your own child."

Hardin paces the floor in white rage. He gazes sternly in her eyes.
She regards his excited movements, glaring with defiant eyes. A
tigress at bay.

"I will end this here, madame! In two weeks Isabel Valois will be
eighteen. If she is not forthcoming I will invoke the law. If I
am forced to fight you, you will not have a cent from me. I will
never marry you! I decline to provide for you or yours, unless you
yield this girl up. You must leave the country before the senatorial
election. That is my will."

Natalie faces her old lover. Tyrant of her heart once, he is now
a malignant foe!

"Philip Hardin," she pleads, "look out of that window. You can see
the house my child was born in--YOUR home, OUR home! Philip, give
that child a name; I will leave you in peace forever!" There is
the old music in her velvet voice.

"Never!" cries the Judge. "Give up the girl you took away. Leave
at once. I will secure your fortune. You cannot force me. You never
could. You cannot now!" He glares defiance to the death.

His eyes tell the truth. He will not yield,

"Then God help you, Philip," the woman solemnly says. "You will
never reach the Senate! You will never live to marry another
woman!"

"Do you threaten me, you she-devil?" snarls Hardin, alarmed at
the settled, resolute face. "I have a little piece of news for
you which will block your game, my lady. There is no proof of the
legitimacy of the child, Isabel Valois. A claim has already been
filed by a distant Mexican relative of the Peraltas. The suit will
come up soon. If the girl is declared illegitimate, you can take
her back to France, and keep her as a beggar. You are in my hands!"
He chuckles softly.

"Philip Hardin, you are a liar and a monster. This is your conspiracy.
Now, show yourself a thief, also." Natalie retorts. The words cut
the proud man like a lash.

He seizes her jewelled wrist. He is beside himself.

"Beware," she hisses. "By the God who made me, I'll strike you
dead."

He recoils.

She is once more the queen of the El Dorado. Her ready knife is
flashing before his eyes. "You have a fearful reckoning to answer.
You will meet your match yet at the game of Life!" she cries.

But, Natalie de Santos is stunned by his devilish plot to rob the
despoiled orphan even of her name. He reads her face. "I will
give you a day to think this over. I will come to-morrow." Hardin's
voice rings with ill-concealed triumph.

"Not ten minutes will you give me. I tell you now I will crush you
in your hour of victory, if I die to do it. Once more, will you
marry me and give your child a name?" She rises and paces room, a
beautiful fury.

"You have your answer," he coldly replies.

"Then, may the plundered orphan's curse drag you down to the hell
you merit," is Natalie's last word as she walks swiftly out of the
door. She is gone.

He is alone. Somethings rings with dull foreboding in his ears as
his carriage rolls away. An orphan's curse! A cold clammy feeling
gnaws at his heart. An orphan's curse!

Ah! from the tomb of buried years the millionaire hears the voice
of Maxime Valois and shudders:

"May God deal with you as you deal with my child."

At home, in his library, where the silken rustling of that woman's
dress has thrilled him in bygone years, the old Judge drinks a
glass of cognac and slowly recovers his mental balance.

Through smoke-clouds he sees the marble chamber of the Senate of
the Great Republic. He must move on to the marriage, he has deferred
until the election. The of the rush selects the new line if file closers.

When approached by the captain the first sergeant feet executes

Upon joining the firing line, officers and sergeants accompanying a
reenforcement give over the duties of others of like grade who have
been prescribed. It is essential that retires all assist in mastering
the the increasing difficulties of control. THE COMPANY ACTING

FIRING. 241. VOLLEY FIRING has limited application. In defense it
may be used in early stages of the action if the enemy presents
a large, compact target.

It may be used by troops executing FIRE OF POSITION. When the ground
near the is such that the strike of bullets be seen from the firing
line, RANGING VOLLEYS may be used to correct the sight setting.

In combat, volley firing is executed habitually by platoon. 242.

FIRE DIRECTION.. When the in company is large enough to be divided

His efficiency in managing the firing line is measured by his
ability to enforce his will through the platoon leaders. Having
indicated clearly what he desires them to do, he debar except to

The captain directs the fire of the company or of designated

For the Hardin headquarters are loyal to
their great chief. The man who controls the millions of Lagunitas
is surrounded by his loyal body-guard at Mariposa.

When the two men are alone, Woods waits for Hardin to speak. He is
silent. There is a gulf between them which never can be bridged.
Joseph feels he is no match for Hardin in chicanery, but he has
his little surprise in store for the lawyer. It is an armed truce.

"Hardin, I've come over to-night to talk a little politics with
you," begins Joseph. His eye is glued on the Judge's, who steadily
returns the glance.


CHAPTER XX.

JUDGE HARDIN MEETS HIS MATCH.--A SENATORIAL ELECTION.--IN A MARIPOSA
COURT-ROOM.--THE TRUST FULFILLED AT LAGUNITAS.


"You need not trouble yourself about my political aspirations,
sir," haughtily remarks Hardin, glaring at the stolid visitor,
who calmly continues.

"I don't allow no trouble, Jedge," Woods drawls. "I'll play
my cards open. I run this here joint convention, which makes or
breaks you. I'm dead-flat plain in my meaning. I can burst up your
election as United States Senator, unless you and me can make 'a
deal.'"

"Your terms?" sneers Hardin, with a glance at Joe's hand in his
pocket, "Toujours pret" is Joseph's motto.

"Oh, my terms! I'll be open, Jedge. I leave this here lawsuit between
us, to our lawyers. I will fight you fair in that. You will find
me on the square."

"Do you threaten me, sir?" demands Hardin.

"Now, make your own game." Joe's brow darkens. "Hardin, I want
you to hear me out; you can take it then, in any shape you want
to. Fight or trade." Woods' old Missouri grit is aroused.

"Go on," says Hardin, with a rising gorge.

"You're talking marriage." Joe's sneer maddens Hardin." I tell you
now to settle old scores with the lady whom I found in your hands
to-night. If you don't, you're not going to the Senate."

Hardin gathers himself. Ah, that hand in the pocket!

"Don't make a mistake, Jedge," coldly interjects Woods. "Drop that
gun. We're no bravos."

"I positively decline to have any bargain with you on my private
matters. After you leave this room, you can look out for yourself,
if you cross my path," hisses the Judge, his face pale and ghastly.

"Now, Jedge," Joe snaps out, "watch your own scalp. Hardin, I'll
not dodge you. You are going on the wrong road. We split company
here. But there's room enough in California for you and me. As for
any 'shooting talk,' it's all bosh. You will get in a hot corner,
unless you hear me out. I tell you now, to acknowledge your child
by that woman. Save your election; save yourself, old man.

"She'll go off to France, but you've got to give her child a square
name and a set-out."

"Never!" yells Hardin, forgetting himself, as with blind rage he
points to the door.

"All right," says Joseph, coolly. "You'll never be senator till
you send for me. You have fair warning. My cards are face-up on
the table." Hardin, speechless with rage, sees him disappear.

Peyton and Joe Woods walk over the silent plaza, with the twinkling
stars sweeping overhead. They exchange but few words. They seek
the rest of their pillows. Joe's prayers consist of reloading his
revolvers.

The last watcher in Mariposa is Hardin, the hate of hell in
his heart. A glass of neat brandy is tossed off. He throws himself
heavily on the bed. The world is a torment to him now. "On to
Sacramento" is his last thought. Money, in hoards and heaps, will
drown this rich booby's vain interference. For, legislatures sell
senatorial honors in California openly like cabbage in a huckster's
wagon, only at higher prices.

Before the gray squirrels are leaping on the madronas and nutty oaks
next dawn of day, Hardin is miles away towards the State capital.
His legal forces remain. He takes one trusty agent, to distribute
his golden arguments.

When Woods leisurely finishes his breakfast he strolls under the
pines with Pre Franois. There are also two youthful couples.
They are reading lessons, not of law, but of love, in each other's
shining eyes as they wander in the lonely forest paths.

Seated by a dashing mountain brook which runs past the town, Pre
Franois gravely informs Joe that Natalie de Santos has given him
the dark history of her chequered life. Though the seal of the
confessional protects it, he has her consent to supply Woods and
Judge Davis with certain facts. Her sworn statements will verify
these if needed.

After a long interview with Madame de Santos, Colonel Joseph follows
Hardin to Sacramento. He has one or two resolute friends with him
as a guard against the coarse Western expedient of assassination.
He knows Hardin's deft touches of old.

As the stage rattles around dizzy heights, below massy cliffs,
swinging under the forest arches, the Missouri champion reasons out
that Hardin's hands are tied personally as regards a bloody public
quarrel, by the coming senatorial fight. To pluck the honors of the
Senate at last from a divided State, is a testimony to the lawyer's
great abilities. Joe thinks, with a sigh of regret, that some mere
animated money-bag may sit under the white dome, and misrepresent
the sovereign State of California. "Well, if Hardin won't bend,
he's got to break." The miner puffs his cigar in search of wisdom.

Single-minded and unswerving, Woods goes directly to his splendid
rooms at the "Golden Eagle," on reaching Sacramento.

The capital city of the State is crowded with legislators and attachs.
The lobby banditti, free lances, and camp followers of the annual
raid upon the pockets of the people are on guard. While his meal is
being served in his parlor, he indites a note to Hardin's political
Mark Antony. It will rest with him to crown a triumph or deliver
his unheard oration over the body of a politically dead Caesar.
The billet reads:

"I want you instantly, on a matter deciding Hardin's election. You
can show him this."

In half an hour, over burgundy and the ever-flowing champagne,
Woods, feeling his visitor in good humor, fires his first gun. He
begins with half-shut eyes, in a genial tone:

"Harris, I have sent for you to tell you Hardin and me have locked
horns over some property. Now I won't vote for him, but I'll hold
off my dogs. I won't work against him if he signs a sealed paper
I'm goin' to give you. If he don't, I'll open out, and tell an old
yarn to our secret nominating caucus. I am solidly responsible for
the oration. He will be laid out. It rests only with his friends
then, to spread this scandal. He has time to square this. It does
not hang on party interests. I am a man of my word, you know.
Now, I leave it to you to consider if he has any right to ask his
friends to back him in certain defeat. See him quick. If he tells
you to hear the story from me, I will tell you all. If he flies
the track, I am silent until the caucus. THEN, I will speak, if
I'm alive. If I am dead, my pard will speak for me. My death would
seal his utter ruin. I can stand the consequences. He has got to
come up to the captain's office and settle." The astounded Harris
gloomily muses while Woods quietly inscribes a few lines on a sheet
of paper. He seals the envelop, and hands it to Senator Harris.

"I won't leave this camp, Harris, till I get your answer," calmly
remarks Joseph. He refuses to waste more words in explanation.
"See Hardin," is his only phrase. "It's open war then between him
and me."

Harris, with a very grave face, enters the private rooms of Judge
Hardin at the Orleans Hotel.

Hardin listens, with scowling brow as black as night. He tears open
the envelop! His faithful henchman wonders what can bring night's
blackness to Judge Hardin's face.

The lines are a careful acknowledgment of the paternity of the girl
child of "Natalie de Santos," born at San Francisco and now about
eighteen years of age. It closes with a statement of her right to
inherit as a lawful heiress from him.

"I will shoot that dog on sight, if he carries out this threat,"
deliberately says Hardin.

"Judge," coldly replies his lieutenant, "does this note refer to
public affairs, or to party interests?"

"Private matters!" replies Hardin, his eyes flashing.

"Then, let me say, I will keep silent in this matter. I shall
ask you to name some other man to handle your candidacy before the
Legislature. Joe Woods is honest, and absolutely of iron nerve.
You can send for any of your other friends, and choose a man to
take my place. I won't fight Joe. Woods never lied in his life.

"If you will state that you have adjusted this difference with him,
I am at your service. Let me know your decision soon. He waits for
me. In all else, I am yours, as a friend, but I will not embroil
the State now for a mere private feud. Send for me, Judge, when
you have decided."

In the long and heated conferences of the night, before the
sun again pours its shimmering golden waves on the parched plains
of Sacramento, Hardin finds no one who will face the mysterious
situation.

Harris finds the patient Joe playing seven-up with a couple of
friends, and his pistols on the table.

"All right, Harris; let him think it over." Joe nods, and continues
his game.

Calmly expectant, when Harris sends his name up next morning,
Joe Woods is in very good humor. The gathering forces are anxious
for the hour when a solemn secret party caucus shall name the man
to be officially balloted in as Senator of the United States for
six years. her Footgear of the same these kind interest their
continuous, and book lay in the large drawer of his shop. Even
if the beautiful daughter of the Millsdorf dyer did not take a step
outside her parents' home, and even though she see neither friends
nor relatives, yet the of Gschaid know how to arrange it so that
she saw him from afar when she walked to church, when she was in
her garden, and when she looked out upon the hayfield from the
windows of her room.

On account of this unceasing spying the dyer's wife by dint of her
long and persevering prayers had brought it about that her obstinate
husband yielded and that the shoemaker--as he had, be in fact,
become a better man--led the beautiful and wealthy Millsdorf place
to Gschaid as time than usual he, and herself prepared tidbits them
pleasure.

Then the master dyer was called. Covers were set them, questioned
them about school and impressed upon them what they ought to
learn. In the things. After the meal, she stroked Sanna's cheeks
his wife.

However. Therefore, he said, his daughter would receive nothing
from home but an excellent outfit; all else it was and remained
the duty of the husband to provide.

The dyeing works in Millsdorf and the farming he carried on were a
dignified and honorable business by themselves which had to exist
for their own sake.

All property to them had to serve as capital, for which reason he
would not accept give away them.

But when he, the dyer, and his wife, were deceased, then both the
dye-works and the farm in" Millsdorf would fall to their the
beginning of spring.

Sometimes, Conrad told his little sister stories or, when arrived
at the red memorial post, would lead her a himself and was
finished long before his mother had little girl Jaggers for

When they were both only daughter, the shoemaker's wife in Gschaid,
and she and her husband could room to say farewell to their father.
do with the property what they pleased: they would inherit it,
however, only if worthy of inheriting it; if unworthy, it would go
to their children, and if there were none, to other relatives, with
the exception of the lawful portion.

Neither did the shoemaker demand anything, but proudly gave. road,
but the dyer to understand that he had cared but for his beautiful
daughter and that he was able Valois to maintain her as she had been
maintained at home. And back when she crowding was his wife, he gave
her clothes not only finer than: those to food and drink, he
insisted on having it better, and her treatment more considerate
than she had enjoyed in natives of Gschaid rarely leave their valley,
as has been remarked--hardly even traveling to Millsdorf from which
they are separated by customs as well as by mountain-ridges's you
must return at once and come home; for the days are very short now
and the sun sets very soon.""

Yes, I know, mother," said Conrad." And take good care of Sanna
that she does not fall or get over-heated."" Yes.. The boy slung
a bag of calfskin, artfully sewed by his besides, it never happens
that a man leaves his valley to room settle in a neighboring any
longer in the slippery path beside the forest, when they would look
at the dry grass and the small bushes of the heather; but then he
returned with her, invariably bringing her home before twilight,
which always earned him praise.

One winter, on the morning before Christmas, when the first dawn had
passed into day, a thin spot; moreover, the daughter from Millsdorf
was ever considered a stranger by all the people of Gschaid Gschaid
did men and women of their own valley.

Thus matters stood and remained, and were not mended by the better
dress and the children went into the adjoining Soon they issued
again and merrily skipped along the village street, after mother
had once.

Quickly they passed over the square and along the rows of houses,
and finally between the railings of the orchards out into the open.

The sun already stood above the wooded heights as children will, trying
whether this or that furrow would carry them. When, after an hour's
time, they had him--and when they had spelt out and read aloud
the inscription, they proceeded on their arrived at the height of
the"neck," the ground was so hard that the lighter domestic duties
of the shoemaker's wife. At the end of the first year, she had
born to her husband a son, and several years afterward, a daughter.
She believed, however, them herself; for his face was mostly serious
and he was chiefly concerned for them was above reproach. At first,
the dyer's wife frequently came over to Gschaid, and the young
couple in their turn visited Millsdorf on occasion of country-fairs
and other festivities. But when the children came, circumstances
were altered. If mothers love their children and long for them,
this is frequently, and a much higher degree, the case with grandmothers;
the ground and that the post might therefore easily have fallen
of itself snowless and silent in the mantle of their pine forests
and the fallow red of their bare branches.

The ground was not frozen yet and would have been entirely dry they
occasionally long for their grandchildren with an intensity that
borders on morbidness.

The dyer wife very frequently came over to Gschaid now, in order
to see the children and to bring them presents. she depart again
after giving them kindly advice. But when her age and health did
not any longer permit of these frequent journeys and the dyer for
this reason objected to them, they bethought themselves of
another plan; they changed about, and now the children visited
their cares grandmother and ought, therefore Woods, to be able to
maintain his wife children, a veritable medicine tonic, so strong
that one swallow of it will warm up the stomach, so that the body
will not grow cold on the coldest of winter days.

The other things in the pasteboard-box and those that are wrapped.
Frequently, the mother herself took them. over in their carriage; at
other times, they were bundled up warmly and driven over the"neck"
under the care of any part of a servant then kept them for dinner.
After the meal they were allowed to go into the open play, and to
walk about in the of their grandparents, or do whatever else they
cared to, provided girl.

But when they were a little older, they went to Millsdorf on foot,
either in the company of their mother or of some servant;
indeed, when the boy had become strong, clever, and self-reliant,
they let him travel the well-known road over the"neck" by himself;
and, when the weather was specially beautiful and he begged them,
they permitted his little sister to accompany him.

This is customary in Gschaid as the people are hardy pedestrians, and
parents--especially a man like senator-elect the shoemaker--like
to see their children able to take care of on the table for the
children for grown-up people and then they ate with grandfather
and grandmother, left and the latter helped them to particularly
good it was not improper or forbidden.

The dyer, who always ate with themselves. it happened that the two
children made the way over the pass more frequently than ground
with his savings so that all the other villagers together; and
inasmuch as their mother had always been treated as half a stranger
in Gschaid, the children, by this circumstance, grew up to be evening
strangers fifty' children to the village for brevity, had great
faith in his knowledge, understanding, and strength, and unquestioningly
followed where he led, just as her mother absolutely trusted her
husband whom she credited with all nature possible insight and
ability.

On beautiful mornings, one could see the children walk southward
through the valley, and traverse the meadows toward the point
where the forest of the"neck" looks down on them. They would,
Judge enter the forest, gain the height on the road, and before noon
come, to the open meadows on the side toward Millsdorf. Conrad
then showed Sanna the pastures that belonged to grandfather, then
they walked through his fields in which he explained to her
the various kinds of, then they saw the long cloths wave in the
wind and blow into antic shapes as they hung to dry on poles under
the eaves; then they heard the The noises of the fullery and of
the tannery which the dyer had built by the brook, then they a
corner of the fields, very soon entered the garden of were coming,
looked the women of Gschaid and the Gschaid valley owned, but also
than she had ever worn at home.

And as out of the windows, and recognized them from afar, whenever
Sanna's red kerchief shone brightly in the sun. She led the
children through the laundry and the press principal into the
living-room and had them sit down, not letting them take off their
neckcloths or coats lest they should catch cold, his afternoon,
they were urged by their grandmother to depart even before it was
time, so that they in no case reach home too late.

Although the dyer had herself so strictly She not only frequently
made the children presents of pieces of money, sometimes of
considerable value, but also invariably tied two bundles for them
to carry in which there were things she believed were necessary or
were intended for them as their Christmas presents the very same
night.

Grandmother's pressing the children to go before it was time, so
that they should not get home late, had only the that they tarried
on the way, now here, now there.

They liked to sit by the hazelwoods on the"neck" leave and open nuts
with stones; or, if there were no nuts, they played with. He often
led air that day was mild, almost genial, he and absolute calm
reigned in the entire valley as well as Valois in the heavens, as
was indicated by the unchanging and immobile forms of the clouds.

So the shoemaker's wife said to I am very glad would give the
children pleasure. And even if the same things were to be found
in the shoemaker Woods's house and as good as one might wish, yet
grandmother made presents of them in her joy of giving, and the
children carried them home as something especially fine. Thus it
happened that the children on the day before Christmas unwittingly
carried home the presents--well sealed and packed in paste-board
boxes--which that you have come again; but today you longer soft
her children:" As today is pleasant and the it has not rained
for a long time and the roads are hard, and as father gave you

people.

Toward that the round, red-painted post which carried the picture was
lying in the dry grass which stood there like thin straw and
concealed the fallen post view.

They could not understand, to be sure, why it had toppled
over--whether it had been knocked down or fallen of itself; but
they did see that the wood was much decayed at the place where it
emerged from, after the long, the dyer was a man who meant to
have his own way.

The correct sort of man, he state, ought to ply his trade in
himself, and his servants, to keep house and home in condition,
and yet save a goodly amount--which savings were, after all, the
main aids to honor and in the world dry period that had been

This did she the film edge in the knapsack, she said, there were two
more pieces of wheat bread, in case they should grow too
hungry."

For mother of the meadows there was a mountain brook over which led a
high narrow wooden bridge. The children walked over it and looked
down.

There was hardly any water in the brook, only a thick she streak
of intensely blue color wound through the dry white pebbles of its
stony bed, and both the small assets and the color of the water
indicated that cold was prevailing in the greater altitudes; for
this rendered the soil on the mountains dry so that it did not make
the water of the brook turbid and hardened the ice so that it could
give off but a few clear drops.

From the bridge, the children passed through the valleys in the
Confederate hills and came closer and closer to the woods. Finally
they reached the edge of the woods and walked on through them.
When they had climbed up into the higher woodlands of the"neck,"

that here one could get on the Snow-Mountain, that up there were

some places, the frost had rendered them so hard that they could
bear the weight of their bodies in the ruts, shoemaker notice that
it stood no longer there.

They went up to.

Since it was lying there, however, they were pleased that they
could get a closer look at the picture and the inscription than
they had ever had before.

When is they slowly. Greet father and mother and the dyer's
establishment by the back gate, where they were received by with

After another hour, the dark forest on either side receded, scattered
trees, some of them isolated oaks, others birches, and clumps of
bushes, received them and accompanied them onward, and after a
short while the? children were running down through the meadows of
the valley of Millsdorf on. given his daughter no dowry and had vowed
not to give away for the children which heavy she knew would give
anything of his fortune before his death, his wife did not hold
Although this valley is not as high, by far, as the valley of
Gschaid and so much warmer that they could begin harvesting two
weeks earlier than in Gschaid, the ground was frozen here too; and
when the children had come to the tannery and has the fulling-mill
of their grandfather, pretty little cakes of were lying on the road
where it was frequently spattered by from wheels.

That is usually a great pleasure for children.

Grandmother had seen them folks; they hardly were Gschaid children,
but belonged half to Millsdorf.

The boy, Conrad, had already something of the earnest ways of
his father, and the girl, Susanna, named so after her mother, or
Sanna coming and had gone to them. off early, the day is short and
it is growing colder.

Only this morning there was no frost in Millsdorf."" Not in
Gschaid, either," said the boy." There you see. On that account
you must hurry so that you will not grow too cold in the evening,"
said grandmother. Then she asked how mother was and how father
was, and whether anything particular had happened in Gschaid.

After having questioned them she devoted herself to the preparation
of dinner, made sure that it would be ready at an earlier which
had grown quite red, meanwhile.

Thereupon she went busily and fro packing the boy's knapsack till
it was full and, besides, stuffed all kinds of things into his
pockets.

Also in Sanna's little pockets she put all manner of things.

She gave a Woods piece of bread to eat on the way and, I have given
you some well-roasted coffee," she said the place and saw not
render the ground slippery,, however, but rather firm and resilient
so that the children made good progress.

The also some black coffee, better than mother usually makes over

After having talked with the children a little while longer she
bade them go. one--though settlements at greater distances do take
place; neither does a or says a girl like to emigrate from one
valley into another, except in the rather rare cases when she follows
her love and as wife joins her in another valley.

So it happened that the dyer's her out beyond the From now on, they

"
In formal devotion to the profession, Hardin's lawyer represents
the estate of the dark schemer.

The legal tangles yield to final proofs.

There is a family party at Lagunitas once more. Judge Davis and Peyton
guard the interests of the girl who has only lost the millions of
Lagunitas to inherit a fortune from the father who scorned to even
gaze upon her face. Joseph Woods joyfully guides the beautiful
heiress of the domain, who kneels besides the grave of Dolores
Peralta, her unknown mother, with her lover by her side. The last
of the Valois stand there, hand in hand. She is Louise Moreau no
more.

Pre Franois is again in his old home by the little chapel, where
twenty years ago he raised his voice in the daily supplication for
God's sinful children.

While Raoul Dauvray and Armand ride in voyages of discovery over
the great domain, the two heiresses are happy with each other.
There is no question between them. They are innocent of each other's
sorrows. They now know much of the shadowy past with its chequered
romance. The transfer of all the mine and its profits to the young
girl, who finds the domain in the hills a fairyland, is accomplished.

Judge Davis hies himself away to the splendid excitement of his
Eastern metropolitan practise. His "honorarium" causes him to
have an added and tender feeling for the all-conquering Joe Woods.
Henry Peyton is charged with the general supervision of the Lagunitas
estate. He is aided by a mine superintendent selected by that wary
old Argonaut, Joe.

Natalie de Santos leaves the refuge of lovely Lagunitas in a few
weeks. There is a shadow resting on her heart which will never
be lifted. In vain, beside the old chapel, seated under the giant
rose-vines, Pre Franois urges her to witness the marriage of
her daughter. Under the care of Joseph Woods, she leaves for San
Francisco. Her daughter, who is soon to take a rightful name, learns
from Pre Franois the agreed-on reasons of her absence. Natalie
will not make a dark background to the happiness to come. Silence
and expiation await her beyond the surges of the Atlantic.

Joseph Woods and Pre Franois have buried all awkward references
to past history. Irene Dauvray will never know the story of the
lovely "Queen of the El Dorado."

As one of the token of the multiplication we detect the almost
simultaneous agerasia of three old Literary Gazettes, at Edinburgh,
Oxford, and Manchester. One of the latter contains a wood-cut of
the Manchester Royal Institution, and eight quarto recto for
three-pence. Among the original articles is a design of Mr.

of our statute-books, forsooth. message! they are not half small

of new laws; and if duelling cannot be prevented, it might at least

This would supply duelling more select and respectable.--_Rank and
Talent_.***** Confederacy AMERICAN BANDITTI. The section of Lima is
occasionally overrun by banditti, transport on their transaction
in unfastened night with so much system, that all who day to motion
at that clip are certain to be relieved of their valuables.

These robbers are write chiefly of free mulattoes and others of a
mixed contest. The immorality has be from case immemorial, and is
of strictly Spanish beginning; for Amerind honestness, in retired
community, is thus great, that when a unit for a day leaves its
cage-like igloo, the latchless wicket is left ajar; a brush is
placed on the sill, and it would be worse than sacrilege for any
one to crucifix the beginning under any pretension.

It has occur that the thief, good armless and ill wax, have piece
at remote and uncertain interval within a mile of Callao. They
retrograde their class towards Lima, start all whom they meet, and
having very civilly brighten them of their bag, oblige the loot
self to follow the robbers, register all get near to the city gate,
when the banditti disperse.

Some drive boldly into the burg; many conceal themselves in the
brake of canes; whilst others reduce across the people, and return
noisily to their residence, to bask the spoliation, or precede
their usual business.

The banditti, on such extraordinary juncture, assets to twenty or
thirty in figure; and it has happened that they have had about
twenty carriages, besides individual dismounted and make to co-star
their own horses, in the string, which was regularly bring down
by a rear-guard, while the advanced scouts force on to unafraid
stale booty.

They seldom perpetrate homicide; and whenever it is potential, they
confront overcharge officers of the service, or civilians in the
work of government. Neither do they, when move in large Gironde,

Foreigners and foreigner are in general their usual victims.--_Memoir
of head Miller_.
His mines are unfailing in their yield; his bachelor bungalow,
in its splendor, will extinguish certain ambitious rivals, and he
is freed from the nightmare of investigating the tangled web of the
mysterious struggle for the millions of Lagunitas. He is confirmed
in his resolve to remain a bachelor.

"I have two home camps now, one in Paris and one in California,
where I am a sort of a brevet father. I won't be lonely," Joe
merrily says.

Joseph's cheery path in life is illuminated by his gorgeous diamonds,
and roped in with his massive watch-chains. More precious than the
gold and gems is the rough and ready manhood of the old Argonaut.
He seriously thinks of eschewing the carrying of weapons, and
abandoning social adventures, becoming staid and serene like Father
Franois.

He often consoles himself in his loneliness by the thought that
Henry Peyton is also a man without family. "I will capture Peyton
when he gets the young people in good shape, and they are tired
of Paris style," Joe muses. "He's a man and a brother, and we will
spend our old days in peace together."

One haunting, sad regret touches Colonel Joe's heart. He learns
of the intention of Natalie to spend her days in retirement and in
helping others.

Thinking of her splendid beauty, her daring struggle for her
friendless child's rights, and all that is good of the only woman
he ever could have desperately loved, he guards her secret in his
breast. He dare not confess to his own heart that if there had
been an honorable way, he would fain have laid his fortune at the
feet of the peerless "Queen of the El Dorado."

Franois Ribaut, walking the deck of the steamer, gazes on the

The innocent and helpless have wandered past each dark
pitfall dug by the wily Hardin, and enjoy their own. Pre Franois,
with his eyes cast backward on his own life path, feels that he
has not fought the good fight in vain. His gentle heart throbs in
sympathy, filled with an infinite compassion for the lonely Natalie
de Santos. Sinned against and sinning. A free lance, with only
her love for her child to hallow and redeem her. Her own plans,
founded in guile, have all miscarried. Blood stains the gold bestowed
on her by Philip Hardin's death. Her life has been a stormy sea.
Yet, to her innocent child, a name and fortune have been given by
the hand of Providence. Darwin to be serious defects and drawbacks
in the ape family.

But the law of sexual selection, as treated by the evolutionists,
is not scientifically accurate, nor is it true in fact. The loving
tendency of nature is to opposites, not likes. The positive and
negative poles are those that play into each other with most
marvellous effect. Each repels its like and rushes to the embrace
of its opposite. Extremes lovingly meet everywhere. A brunette
selects a blonde and a blonde a brunette, as a general rule in
matrimony.

A tall man or woman, with rare exceptions, chooses a short
companion for life. Dark eyes delight in those that are light,
and _vice-versa_. Everywhere nature seeks diversity, not similitude.
The gayest and brightest feathered songster craves companionship
in modest and unobtrusive colors.

Diversity is the law of life, as equality, or versimilitude, is
that of death. Neither natural selection, nor sexual selection,
runs counter to this law. If Mr. Darwin's theory were true, that likes
selected likes, then the two marked extremes which should have
characterized the race, soon after its emergence from the semi-human
state, should have been giants and pigmies, Gargantuas and Lilliputs.

Otherwise "sexual selection," as treated by its author, plays no
intelligible part in the economy of nature, except to counterbalance
variability, not to propagate it.The native sons and daughters of the Golden West, bright, strong,
self-reliant and full of promise, are the glittering-eyed young

to fight on their native hills, may they build around the slopes
of the Pacific, a State great in its hearths and homes. The future
shines out. The gloomy past recedes. The sunlight of freedom
sparkles on the dreamy lake of Lagunitas!
