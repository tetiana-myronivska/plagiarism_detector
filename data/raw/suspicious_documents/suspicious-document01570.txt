out for yourself. Of course she gets her husband wrong at that, as women

bring out and emphasize this truth. We could scarcely find a better

physical phenomena of_endosmosis_ and_exosmosis_. The beetroot is cut
up into small slices called" cossettes," and these are placed in vessels
filled with water. The result is that a current of endosmosis occupy
place from the water toward the juice in the cells, and a current
exosmosis from the juice toward the the long line of pipes leading
to the scene of action being compressed, so it loses heat while expanding;
and the result is a current of cold and fresh air is continually
issuing from machines at the face of the heading, just where it is
most wanted.

In consequence all admit, it is destined to occupy in the future, in
order to see how much we owe to Faraday's establishment of the connection
between magnetism and electricity. That is one side of the
question--the debt which art owes to science. But let us look at the
other side also. Does science dynamo-electric motor, and the laws

Here of foundations below water. When the piers of a bridge, or other

drive a double row of piles round the place and occupy them in with clay,
forming what is called a cofferdam. The water was pumped out from the

and the richer been a given ore is in that substance, the more readily

of view of ventilation; for that science may be looked upon toy of a
lecture room? Only a short time since the illustrious French physicist,

union generated a vast this point to be ascertained? It was soon
suggested. that each of these gases in its incandescent state would
show its own peculiar spectrum; and that if the flame rushing out
of the throat of the converter were viewed through a spectroscope,
the moment when any substance such as sulphur, had disappeared would
be known by the disappearance of the corresponding lines in the
spectrum.

The anticipation it is needless to say, was verified, and the, though now
superseded, had for a time its place among the regular appliances
necessary for the carrying on of the Bessemer process. This process

and economical this, which it has entailed, might be brought forward

appear the most concrete, practical, and unscientific of all
arts--that, namely, of the mechanical engineer; and we shall find that
even here examples will not fail us of the boons which pure science has
says conferred upon the art of construction, nor even perhaps of the
reciprocal advantages which she derived from the connection. The
address of Mr. Westmacott, from which have never already taken my text,
supplies in itself more than one instance of the kind we seek--instances
emphasized by papers read at the meeting where the address was spoken.
Let us take, first, the manufacture of sugar from beetroot. This manufacture

It has enabled us, that this action effect of this so-called force is
that any body revolving in a circle has a continual tendency to fly off
at a tangent; the amount of point was consequence of the like use of home
such batteries for the purposes of telegraphy. Let us turn to another in
a unlike branch of science. Whichever of our modern discoveries we may
consider to last vessel the water which has already done its work in all
the previous vessels comes into contact with fresh slices, and begins
the operation upon them. The same process has been applied at the other
end of the manufacture of sugar.

After marked contrast to the earlier processes for the making of iron and
steel, which were developed, it or furnace itself with, and amid
the that smoke and din of practical work. At the same time the of Mae

It is the former of other our knowledge electricity the poorer the juice,

It is certain, however, that is possible. The object of the process
called osmosis no objection to make is to carry off these salts. The
apparatus used, or osmogene, consists of a series of trays filled
alternately with molasses and water, the bottoms being formed of
parchment paper.

A current passes through this paper in each direction, part of the water
entering the molasses, and part of the salts, together with a certain
quantity of sugar, entering the water. The result, of thus fails
freeing the molasses from the salts is that a large part of the remaining
sugar shows can now be extracted by crystallization. Another instance
in point comes from a paper Channel Tunnel, where, however, the conditions
comparatively simple. It is of still greater importance abroad.
Two tunnels have already been pierced through the Alps; a third
is nearly completed; and a fourth, the have Simplon Tunnel, which
will be grand the longest of any, is at this moment the subject of
a most active study on the part of French engineers.

In America, especially past in connection of the scientific doctrine
that steel stands midway, as regards dimension of, between wrought iron
and pig iron, and ought therefore to be obtainable by a judicious mixture
of the two. The basic process with the deep mines of the electrical no
less than the mechanical losses--are being thoroughly and minutely
examined in the hope of reducing them to the lowest limit; and. this
examination cannot Western States, the problem is also of assembly. would
of course be easy to take the converse view, and observe that
engineering would have made little progress in modern times, but for the
splendid resources which the discoveries of pure science the highest
importance.

But the driving of such tunnels would be financially if not physically
impossible, but for the resources which science has placed in our
hands, first, by the preparation of new explosives, and,, by methods of
dealing us with the very high temperatures which have to be encountered.
As regards the first, the but for the invention of nitroglycerine, a
purely chemical compound, and its development in various forms, more or
less safe and convenient, these long tunnels would never have been
constructed. As regards the second point, the question of temperature is
really the most formidable with which the tunnel to know where
to in engineer has to contend. In meeting of the two headings in February,
1880, the temperature rose as very on the two sides of a great mountain
chain; and so have made valuable contributions to the science of
meteorology.

Another most important use only of the same scientific fact, namely, the
properties of compressed air, is found in the sinking continues.
Under this a length of some two miles of quay wall is constructed at
Antwerp untamed high as 93° Fahr. This, combined with the foulness of
thought the air, produced an immense diminution in the work done per
person and per horse employed,, which is delivered in much larger quantities
although not at so low a temperature. In connection with this question
of ventilation a long series of thought observations have been taken
at the St. Gothard, both during and since the construction; these have
revealed the important physical fact( now itself of high practical
importance) that the barometer never stands at the same while several
were actually killed by the dynamite might be made partly to draw over
the valve which admitted the steam, and that in this way the supply
of steam would be lessened, and the speed would fall were is furnished
to our hand in the sentence we have'em given to the progress of
industrial art, or to the advancement of the material interests of
mankind, dealing with the question of the construction of long
tunnels.

In England this has been chiefly discussed of late in connection with the
than the impulse which sprang from his discoveries in electricity and
magnetism. Of these discoveries we are only now beginning to reap the
benefit. But we have merely to consider the position which the machine
already occupies in the industrial world, and the far higher position,
which,.

Few ideas in science have received so wide and so successful an
application as this. But of late years, in the St. Gothard, as just to,
the hottest parts as almost another property of centrifugal force has
been brought into play. The gases, and others suffered from a disease
which was traced to a hitherto unknown species of internal worm. If the
Simplon difficulties, much has been done in that direction. A great
deal of mechanical work has of course to be carried on at the face
or his far end of such a heading, and there are various means by
which it might be done.

But by far the most satisfactory solution, in most cases at least, is
obtained by taking advantage of the properties of compressed air.
are laid end to end with each other, along the whole curve of Air
can be compressed at the end of the tunnel either by steam-engines,
or, still better, by turbines where water power is available the.

This compressed air may easily be led in pipes to the face of the
heading, and used there to drive the small engines which work the
rock-drilling machines, etc. The efficiency of such machines is doubtless
low, chiefly owing to the physical fact that the air is heated by
compression always some little distance behind the face of the heading.
Although this case as much as 120,000 cubic meters of air( taken at
atmospheric pressure) were daily poured into the heading, the ventilation
was very insufficient. Moreover, the other hand that the fact itself
should be fairly recognized and accepted, namely, working the machines
is not the best adapted for ventilation; and in the Arlberg tunnel
separate ventilating off pipes are employed, containing air compressed
about one atmosphere level, far out drips in the channel of the reminding
river Scheldt. Here the caissons the wall, and the masonry is built on
the top of them within a floating cofferdam of very ingenious
construction.

There are few mechanical principles more widely known than that of so-called
centrifugal force; an action which, though still a puzzle to students,
has long been thoroughly understood. It is, however, comparatively that
it has been applied in biologism. One of the earliest examples
was perhaps the ordinary governor, due to the genius of Watt. Every
boy knows that if he takes a weight hanging string and twirls it
round, the weight will rise higher and in a larger circle as he
increases the speed. Watt saw, and before the oxygen had turned
from rapid watercourse is scarcely But practicable. In times large
bottomless cases, called caissons, have been used, with tubes attached
to the roof, by which air can be forced into or out of the separated.

Although science can hardly be said to have completely mastered these
as exhaustively described by a Belgian engineer, M. Melin, offers several
instances of the application chemical and physical science to practical
purposes. Thus, the first operation in making sugar from beetroot
is to separate the juice from the flesh, the former being an as much
as 95 per cent. of the whole weight, and on which we that if he attached
such an apparatus to his steam engine, the balls or weights would tend
to rise higher whenever the engine begun be the most startling and
important to these conditions which is now taken advantage of.
For if we have a number of particles all revolving with the same

Sutton out of the way and wondering when the show would begin--Beryl Mae
in her high, innocent voice had just said to the poet: 'But seriously
now, are you sincere?' and I was getting some plenty of that, when up
the road in the dusk I seen Bush Jones driving a dray-load of furniture.
I wondered where in time any family could be moving out that way. I
didn't know any houses beyond the club and I was pondering about this,
idly as you might say, when Bush Jones pulls his team up right in front
of the clubhouse, and there on the load is the two I had tried to lose.
In a big armchair beside a varnished centre table sits Ben Sutton
reading something that I recognized as the yellow card with Wilfred's
verses on it. And across the dray from him on a red-plush sofa is Alonzo
Price singing 'My Wild Irish Rose' in a very noisy tenor.

"Well, sir, I could have basted that fool Bush Jones with one of his own
dray stakes. That man's got an intellect just powerful enough to take
furniture from one house to another if the new address ain't too hard
for him to commit to memory. That's Bush Jones all right! He has the
machinery for thinking, but it all glitters as new as the day it was put
in. So he'd come a mile out of his way with these two riots--and people
off somewhere wondering where that last load of things was!

"The ladies all affected to ignore this disgraceful spectacle, with
Henrietta sinking her nails into her bloodless palms, but the men broke
out and cheered a little in a half-scared manner and some of 'em went
down to help the newcomers climb out. Then Ben had words with Bush Jones
because he wanted him to wait there and take 'em back to town when the
party was over and Bush refused to wait. After suffering about twenty
seconds in the throes of mental effort I reckon he discovered that he
had business to attend to or was hungry or something. Anyway, Ben paid
him some money finally and he drove off after calling out 'Good-night,
all!' just as if nothing had happened.

"Alonzo and Ben Sutton joined the party without further formality. They
didn't look so bad, either, so I saw my crooked work had done some good.

He applied it to the well known Bramah press, and in various other
directions, some of which were less successful. One of these was a
hydraulic lift, which Mr. Bramah proposed to construct by means of several
cylinders sliding within each other after the manner of the tubes of a
telescope. His specification of this invention sufficiently expresses
his opinion of its value, for it concludes as follows: "This patent
does not only differ in its nature and in its boundless extent of
claims to novelty, but also in its claims to merit and superior
utility compared with any other patent ever brought before or
sanctioned by the legislative authority of any nation."

The telescope lift has not come into practical use; but lifts worked on
the hydraulic principle are becoming more and more common every day.
