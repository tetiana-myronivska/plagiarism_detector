We came into a straggling village; that we could see by the
starlight. But we stopped at the door of a very unhotel-like
appearing hotel. It had in front a flower-garden; it was blazing
with welcome lights; it opened hospitable doors, and we were received
by a family who expected us. The house was a large one, for two
guests; and we enjoyed the luxury of spacious rooms, an abundant
supper, and a friendly welcome; and, in short, found ourselves at
home. The proprietor of the Telegraph House is the superintendent of
the land lines of Cape Breton, a Scotchman, of course; but his wife
is a Newfoundland lady. Thus Mr. Woodbury states[493] that he
has several times seen queen bees of the common kind annulated with
yellow like Ligurian queens, and the latter dark-coloured
like common bees. He has also observed variations in the colour
of the drones, without any corresponding difference in the queens or
workers of the same hive. The great apiarian Dzierzon, in answer to
my queries on this subject, says[494] that in Germany bees of some
stocks are decidedly dark, whilst others are remarkable for their
yellow colour.

Bees also seem to differ in habits in different districts, for Dzierzon
adds, "If many stocks with their offspring are more inclined to
swarm, whilst others are richer in honey, so that some bee-keepers
even distinguish between swarming and honey-gathering bees, this is
a habit which has become second nature, caused by the customary
mode of keeping the bees and the pasturage of the district. For
example; what a difference in this respect one may perceive to
exist between the bees of the Lüneburg heath and those of this
country!"...
"Removing an old queen and substituting a young one of the current
year is here an infallible mode of keeping the strongest
stock from swarming and preventing drone-breeding; whilst the same
means if adopted in Hanover would certainly be of no avail."

I procured a hive full of dead bees from Jamaica, where they have
long been naturalised, and, on carefully comparing them under the
microscope with my own bees, I could detect not a trace of
difference.

This remarkable uniformity in the hive-bee, wherever kept, may probably
be accounted for by the great difficulty, or rather impossibility,
of bringing selection into play by pairing particular queens and drones,
for these insects unite only during {299} flight.

Nor is there any record, with a single partial exception, of any person
having separated and bred from a hive in which the workers presented
some appreciable difference. In order to form a new breed, seclusion
from other bees would, as we now know, be indispensable; for since
the introduction of the Ligurian bee into Germany and
England, it has been found that the drones wander at least two miles
from their own hives, and often cross with the queens of the common
bee.[495] The Ligurian bee, although perfectly fertile when crossed
with the common kind, is ranked by most naturalists as a distinct
species, whilst by others it is ranked as a natural variety: but
this form need not here be noticed, as there is no reason to believe
that it is the product of domestication.

Although the farmers
about the Bras d'Or are well-to-do they do not give their minister
enough to keep his soul in his Gaelic body, and his poor support is
eked out by the contributions of a missionary society. It was
gratifying to learn that this was not from stinginess on the part of
the people, but was due to their religious principle. It seemed to
us that everybody ought to be good in a country where it costs next
to nothing.

When the service was over, about half of the people departed; the
rest remained in their seats and prepared to enter upon their Sabbath
exercises. These latter were all Gaelic people, who had understood
little or nothing of the English service. The minister turned
himself at once into a Gaelic preacher and repeated in that language
the long exercises of the morning. The sermon and perhaps the
prayers were quite as enjoyable in Gaelic as in English, and the
singing was a great improvement. It was of the same Psalms, but the
congregation chanted them in a wild and weird tone and manner, as
wailing and barbarous to modern ears as any Highland devotional
outburst of two centuries ago. This service also lasted about two
hours; and as soon as it was over the faithful minister, without any
rest or refreshment, organized the Sunday-school, and it must have
been half past three o'clock before that was over. We will now
enter into details.

The accurate and sagacious Richardson says, "The resemblance between
the Northern American wolves (_Canis lupus, var.
occidentalis_) and the domestic dogs of the Indians is so great
that the size and strength of the wolf seems to be the only
difference. I have more than once mistaken a band of wolves
for the dogs of a party of Indians; and the howl of the animals of
both species is prolonged so exactly in the same key that even the
practised ear of the Indian fails at times to discriminate them."
He adds that the more northern Esquimaux dogs are not only extremely
like the grey wolves of the Arctic circle in form and colour,
but also nearly equal them in size. Dr. Kane has often seen in his
teams of sledge-dogs the oblique eye (a character on which
some naturalists lay great stress), the drooping tail, and
scared look of the wolf. In disposition the Esquimaux dogs differ
little from wolves, and, according to Dr. Hayes, they are
capable of no attachment to man, and are so savage, that {22} when
hungry they will attack even their masters. According to Kane they
readily become feral. Their affinity is so close with wolves that
they frequently cross with them, and the Indians take the whelps
of wolves "to improve the breed of their dogs." The half-bred
wolves sometimes (Lamare-Picquot) cannot be tamed, "though
this case is rare;" but they do not become thoroughly well broken in
till the second or third generation.
These facts show that there can be but little, if any, sterility
between the Esquimaux dog and the wolf, for otherwise they would not
be used to improve the breed. As Dr. Hayes says of these dogs,
"reclaimed wolves they doubtless are.The evil has
become so great and burdensome that the celebration of this sacred
rite will have to be reformed altogether.

Such a Sabbath quiet pervaded the street of Baddeck, that the fast
driving of the Gaels in their rattling, one-horse wagons, crowded
full of men, women, and children,--released from their long sanctuary
privileges, and going home,--was a sort of profanation of the day;
and we gladly turned aside to visit the rural jail of the town.

Upon the principal street or road of Baddeck stands the dreadful
