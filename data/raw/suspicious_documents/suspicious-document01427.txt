CONFESSIONS AND CRITICISMS.


CHAPTER I.

A PRELIMINARY CONFESSION.


I took up one of the latter, in order to ascertain its genus. The
captain kindly informed me that it was the remains of a pig, which
had cost him a great deal of trouble to obtain, as the French
viewed the act of eating a pig as very little less heinous than the act
of eating a child. Suspicions began to trouble me, and I now turned to look
for the head and reproachful eye of the brigadier.

The head was where I had just before seen it, visible over the top of a
trunk; but it was so far raised as to enable me to see that it was still
planted on its shoulders. A second look enabled me to distinguish the
meditative, philosophical countenance of Dr.
Reasono, who was still in the hussar-jacket and petticoat, though, being
in the house, he had very properly laid aside the Spanish hat with
bedraggled feathers.

A movement followed in the antechamber, and a hurried conversation, in a
low, earnest tone, succeeded. The captain disappeared, and joined the
speakers. I listened intently, but could not catch any of the intonations
of a dialect founded on the decimal principle.
Presently the door opened, and Dr. Etherington stood before me!

The good divine regarded me long and earnestly. Tears filled his eyes, and,
stretching out both hands towards me, he asked:

"Do you know me, Jack?"
"Know you, dear sir!--Why should I not?"
"And do you forgive me, dear boy?"
"For what, sir?--I am sure, I have most reason to demand your pardon
for a thousand follies."
"Ah! the letter--the unkind--the inconsiderate letter!"
"I have not had a letter from you, sir, in a twelvemonth; the last was
anything but unkind."
"Though Anna wrote, it was at my dictation."
I passed a hand over my brow, and had dawnings of the truth.

"Anna?"
"Is here--in Paris--and miserable--most miserable!--on your account."
Every particle of monikinity that was left in my system instantly gave way
to a flood of human sensations.

"Let me fly to her, dear sir--a moment is an age!"
"Not just yet, my boy. We have much to say to each other, nor is she in
this hotel. To-morrow, when both are better prepared, you shall meet."

"Add, never to separate, sir, and I will be patient as a lamb."
"Never to separate, I believe it will be better to say."
I hugged my venerable guardian, and found a delicious relief from a
most oppressive burden of sensations, in a flow of tears,

Dr. Etherington soon led me into a calmer tone of mind. In the course of
the day, many matters were discussed and settled. I was told that Captain
Poke had been a good nurse, though in a sealing fashion; and that the least
I could do was to send him back to Stunin'tun, free of cost. This was
agreed to, and the worthy but dogmatical mariner was promised the means
of fitting out a new "Debby and Dolly."
"These philosophers had better be presented to some academy," observed the
doctor, smiling, as he pointed to the family of amiable strangers, "being
already F. U. D. G. E.'s and H. O. A. X.'s. Mr.
Reasono, in particular, is unfit for ordinary society."
"Do with them as you please, my more than father. Let the poor animals,
however, be kept from physical suffering."
"Attention shall be paid to all their wants, both physical and
moral."

"And in a day or two, we shall proceed to the rectory?"
"The day after to-morrow, if you have strength."
"And to-morrow?"
"Anna will see you."
"And the next day?"
"Nay, not quite so soon, Jack; but the moment we think you perfectly
restored, she shall share your fortunes for the remainder of your common
probation."

CHAPTER XXX.

EXPLANATIONS--A LEAVE-TAKING--LOVE--CONFESSIONS, BUT NO PENITENCE.

A night of sweet repose left me refreshed, and with a pulse that denoted
less agitation than on the preceding day. I awoke early, had a bath, and
sent for Captain Poke to take his coffee with me, before we parted;
for it had been settled, the previous evening, that he was to proceed
towards Stunin'tun forthwith.

My old messmate, colleague, co-adventurer, and fellow-traveller, was not
slow in obeying the summons. I confess his presence was a comfort to me,
for I did not like looking at objects that had been so inexplicably
replaced before my eyes, unsupported by the countenance of one who had
gone through so many grave scenes in my company.

"This has been a very extraordinary voyage of ours, Captain Poke," I remarked,
after the worthy sealer had swallowed sixteen eggs, an omelet, seven
cotelettes, and divers accessories. "Do you think of publishing your
private journal?"
"Why, in my opinion, Sir John, the less that either of us says of
the v'y'ge the better."

"And why so? We have had the discoveries of Columbus, Cook, Vancouver, and
Hudson--why not those of Captain Poke?"
"To own the truth, we sealers do not like to speak of our cruising grounds--and,
as for these monikins, after all, what are they good for? A thousand of
them wouldn't make a quart of 'ile, and by all accounts their fur is
worth next to nothin'."
"Do you account their philosophy for nothing? and their jurisprudence?--you,
who were so near losing your head, and who did actually lose your tail, by
the axe of the executioner?"
Noah placed a hand behind him, fumbling about the seat of reason,
with evident uneasiness. Satisfied that no harm had been done, he very
coolly placed half a muffin in what he called his "provision hatchway."

"You will give me this pretty model of our good old 'Walrus,' captain?"
"Take it, o' Heaven's sake, Sir John, and good luck to you with it.
You, who give me a full-grown schooner, will be but poorly paid with a toy."

"It's as like the dear old craft as one pea is like another!"
"I dare say it may be. I never knew a model that hadn't suthin' of the
original in it."
"Well, my good shipmate, we must part. You know I am to go and see the lady
who is soon to be my wife, and the diligence will be ready to take
you to Havre, before I return."

"God bless you! Sir John--God bless you!" Noah blew his nose till it rung
like a French horn. I thought his little coals of eyes were glittering,
too, more than common, most probably with moisture.
"You're a droll navigator, and make no more of the ice than a colt makes of
a rail. But though the man at the wheel is not always awake the heart seldom
sleeps."
"When the 'Debby and Dolly' is fairly in the water, you will do me the
pleasure of letting me know it."
"Count on me, Sir John. Before we part, I have, however, a small favor
to ask."
"Name it."
Here Noah drew out of his pocket a sort of basso relievo carved in pine.
It represented Neptune armed with a harpoon instead of a trident;
the captain always contending that the god of the seas should never carry
the latter, but that, in its place, he should be armed either with
the weapon he had given him, or with a boat-hook.
On the right of Neptune was an English gentleman holding out a bag of
guineas. On the other was a female who, I was told, represented the
goddess of liberty, while it was secretly a rather flattering likeness of
Miss Poke. The face of Neptune was supposed to have some similitude to
that of her husband. The captain, with that modesty which is invariably the
companion of merit in the arts, asked permission to have a copy of this
design placed on the schooner's stern. It would have been churlish to
refuse such a compliment; and I now offered Noah my hand, as the time for
parting had arrived. The sealer grasped me rather tightly, and seemed
disposed to say more than adieu.

       

"You are going to see an angel, Sir John."
"How!--Do you know anything of Miss Etherington?"
"I should be as blind as an old bumboat else. During our late v'y'ge, I saw
her often."
"This is strange!--But there is evidently something on your mind, my
friend; speak freely."
"Well, then, Sir John, talk of anything but of our v'y'ge, to the dear
crittur. I do not think she is quite prepared yet to hear of all
the wonders we saw."
I promised to be prudent; and the captain, shaking me cordially by
the hand, finally wished me farewell.

There were some rude touches of feeling in his manner, which reacted on
certain chords in my own system; and he had been gone several minutes
before I recollected that it was time to go to the Hotel de Castile. Too
impatient to wait for a carriage, I flew along the streets on foot,
believing that my own fiery speed would outstrip the zigzag
movement of a fiacre or a cabriolet tie flace.

Dr. Etherington met me at the door of his appartement, and led
me to an inner room without speaking. Here he stood gazing, for some
time, in my face, with paternal concern.

"She expects you, Jack, and believes that you rang the bell."
"So much the better, dear sir. Let us not lose a moment; let me fly and
throw myself at her feet, and implore her pardon."
"For what, my good boy?"
"For believing that any social stake can equal that which a man feels in the
nearest, dearest ties of earth!"
The excellent rector smiled, but he wished to curb my impatience.

"You have already every stake in society, Sir John Goldencalf," he
answered--assuming the air which human beings have, by a general
convention, settled shall be dignified--"that any reasonable man
can desire.

The large fortune left by your late father, raises you, in this respect,
to the height of the richest in the land; and now that you are a baronet,
no one will dispute your claim to participate in the councils of the
nation. It would perhaps be better, did your creation date a century or
two nearer the commencement of the monarchy; but, in this age of
innovations, we must take things as they are, and not as we might wish
to have them."
I rubbed my forehead, for the doctor had incidentally thrown out an embarrassing
idea.

"On your principle, my dear sir, society would be obliged to begin
with its great-grandfathers to qualify itself for its own government."

"Pardon me, Jack, if I have said anything disagreeable--no doubt all will
come right in heaven. Anna will be uneasy at our delay."
This suggestion drove all recollection of the good rector's social- stake
system, which was exactly the converse of the social-stake system of my
late ancestor, quite out of my head. Springing forward, I gave him reason
to see that he would have no farther trouble in changing the subject.
When we had passed an antechamber, he pointed to a door, and admonishing
me to be prudent, withdrew.

My hand trembled as it touched the door-knob, but the lock yielded.
Anna was standing in the middle of the room (she had heard my footsteps),
an image of womanly loveliness, womanly faith, and womanly feeling.
By a desperate effort, she was, however, mistress of her emotions.

Though her pure soul seemed willing to fly to meet me, she obviously restrained
the impulse, in order to spare my nerves.

"Dear Jack!"--and both her soft, white, pretty little hands met
me, as I eagerly approached.

"Anna!--dearest Anna!"--I covered the rosy fingers with kisses.

"Let us be tranquil, Jack, and if possible, endeavor to be reasonable,
too."
"If I thought this could really cost one habitually discreet as you an
effort, Anna?"

"One habitually discreet as I, is as likely to feel strongly on meeting an
old friend, as another."
"I think it would make me perfectly happy, could I see thee weep."

As if waiting only for this hint, Anna burst into a flood of tears.
I was frightened, for her sobs became hysterical and convulsed.

Those precious sentiments which had been so long imprisoned in her gentle
bosom, obtained the mastery, and I was well paid for my selfishness, by
experiencing an alarm little less violent than her own outpouring of
feeling.

Touching the incidents, emotions, and language of the next half hour,
it is not my intention to be very communicative.

Anna was ingenuous, unreserved, and, if I might judge by the rosy blushes
that suffused her sweet face, and the manner in which she extricated
herself from my protecting arms, I believe I must add, she deemed herself
indiscreet in that she had been so unreserved and ingenuous.

"We can now converse more calmly, Jack," the dear creature resumed, after
she had erased the signs of emotion from her cheeks--"more calmly, if not
more sensibly."

"The wisdom of Solomon is not half so precious as the words I have just
heard--and as for the music of spheres--"
"It is a melody that angels only enjoy."
"And art not thou an angel?"
"No, Jack, only a poor, confiding girl; one instinct with the
affections and weaknesses of her sex, and one whom it must be your
part to sustain and direct. If we begin by calling each other by these
superhuman epithets, we may awake from the delusion sooner than if we
commence with believing ourselves to be no other than what we really
are. I love you for your kind, excellent, and generous heart, Jack; and as
for these poetical beings, they are rather proverbial, I believe, for
having no hearts at all."

As Anna mildly checked my exaggeration of language--after ten years of
marriage I am unwilling to admit there was any exaggeration of idea--she
placed her little velvet hand in mine again, smiling away all the severity
of the reproof.

"Of one thing, I think you may rest perfectly assured, dear girl,"
I resumed, after a moment's reflection.

"All my old opinions concerning expansion and contraction are radically
changed. I have carried out the principle of the social-stake system in
the extreme, and cannot say that I have been at all satisfied with its
success.
At this moment I am the proprietor of vested interests which are
scattered over half the world. So far from finding that I love my kind
any more for all these social stakes, I am compelled to see that the
wish to protect one, is constantly driving me into acts of injustice
against all the others. There is something wrong, depend on it, Anna,
in the old dogmas of political economists!"
"I know little of these things, Sir John, but to one ignorant as myself,
it would appear that the most certain security for the righteous exercise
of power is to be found in just principles."
"If available, beyond a question.

They who contend that the debased and ignorant are unfit to express their
opinions concerning the public weal, are obliged to own that they can only
be restrained by force. Now, as knowledge is power, their first precaution
is to keep them ignorant; and then they quote this very ignorance, with
all its debasing consequences, as an argument against their participating
in authority with themselves. I believe there can be no safe medium between
a frank admission of the whole principle--"
"You should remember, dear Goldencalf, that this is a subject on which I
know but little.

It ought to be sufficient for us that we find things as they are;
if change is actually necessary, we should endeavor to effect it with
prudence and a proper regard to justice."
Anna, while kindly leading me back from my speculations, looked both anxious
and pained.

"True--true"--I hurriedly rejoined, for a world would not tempt me to prolong
her suffering for a moment. "I am foolish and forgetful, to be talking
thus at such a moment; but I have endured too much to be altogether
unmindful of ancient theories. I thought it might be grateful to you,
at least, to know, Anna, that I have ceased to look for happiness
in my affections for all, and am only so much the better disposed
to turn in search of it to one,"
"To love our neighbor as ourself, is the latest and highest of the
divine commands," the dear girl answered, looking a thousand times
more lovely than ever, for my conclusion was very far from being
displeasing to her.

"I do not know that this object is to be attained by centring in our persons
as many of the goods of life as possible; but I do think, Jack, that the
heart which loves one truly, will be so much the better disposed to
entertain kind feelings towards all others."
I kissed the hand she had given me, and we now began to talk a little more
like people of the world, concerning our movements. The interview
lasted an hour longer, when the heaven. "You never yet were so unkind
to one who was offensive; much less could you willingly have plotted
this cruelty to one you regard!"
Anna could no longer control herself, but her cheeks were wetted
with the usual signs of feeling in her sex.

Then smiling in the midst of this little outbreaking of womanly sensibility,
her countenance became playful and radiant.

"That letter ought not to be altogether proscribed, neither, Jack.
Had it not been written, you would never have visited Leaphigh, nor Leaplow,
nor have seen any of those wonderful spectacles which are here
recorded."
The dear creature laid her hand on a roll of manuscript which she had just
returned to me, after its perusal. At the same time, her face flushed,
as vivid and transient feelings are reflected from the features
of the innocent and ingenuous, and she made a faint effort to laugh.

I passed a hand over my brow, for whenever this subject is alluded to
between us, I invariably feel that there is a species of mistiness, in
and about the region of thought. I was not displeased, however,
for I knew that a heart which loved so truly would not willingly cause me
pain, nor would one habitually so gentle and considerate, utter a syllable
that she might have reason to think would seriously displease.

"Hadst thou been with me, love, that journey would always be remembered
as one of the pleasantest events of my life, for, while it had its
perils and its disagreeables, it had also its moments of extreme
satisfaction."

"You will never be an adept in political saltation, John!"
"Perhaps not--but here is a document that will render it less necessary
than formerly."
I threw her a packet which had been received that morning from town, by
a special messenger, but of whose contents I had not yet spoken.
Anna was too young a wife to open it without an approving look from
my fond eye. On glancing over its contents, she perceived that I
was raised to the House of Peers by the title of Viscount
Householder.
The purchase of three more boroughs, and the influence of my old
friend Lord Pledge, had done it all.
The sweet girl looked pleased, for I believe it is in female nature
to like to be a viscountess; but, throwing herself into my arms,
she protested that her joy was at my elevation and not at her
own.
"I owed you this effort, Anna, as some acknowledgment for your faith
and disinterestedness in the affair of Lord M'Dee."
"And yet, Jack, he had neither high cheek-bones, nor red hair; and
his accent was such as might please a girl less capricious than
myself!"
This was said playfully and coquettishly, but in a way to make me
feel how near folly would have been to depriving me of a treasure,
had the heart I so much prized been less ingenuous and pure. I drew
the dear creature to my bosom, as if afraid my rival might yet rob
me of her possession. Anna looked up, smiling through her tears;
and, making an effort to be calm, she said, in a voice so smothered
as to prove how delicate she felt the subject to be:--
"We will speak seldom of this journey, dear John, and try to think
of the long and dark journey which is yet before us. We will speak
of it, however, for there should be nothing totally concealed between
us."
I kissed her serene and humid eyes, and repeated what she had just
said, syllable for syllable. Anna has not been unmindful of her
words; for rarely, indeed, has she touched on the past, and then
oftener in allusion to her own sorrows, than in reference to my
impressions.
But, while the subject of my voyage to the monikin region is, in a
measure, forbidden between me and my wife, there exists no such
restraint as between me and other people. The reader may like to
know, therefore, what effect this extraordinary adventure has left
on my mind, after an interval of ten years.
There have been moments when the whole has appeared a dream; but,
on looking back, and comparing it with other scenes in which I have
been an actor, I cannot perceive that this is not quite as indelibly
stamped on my memory as those. The facts themselves, moreover, are
so very like what I see daily in the course of occurrence around
me, that I have come to the conclusion, I did go to Leaphigh in the
way related, and that I must have been brought back during the
temporary insanity of a fever. I believe, therefore, that there are
such countries as Leaphigh and Leaplow; and after much thought, I
am of opinion that great justice has here been done to the monikin
character in general.
The result of much meditation on what I witnessed, has been to
produce sundry material changes in my former opinions, and to
unsettle even many of the notions in which I may be said to have
been born and bred. In order to consume as little of the reader's
time as possible, I shall set down a summary of my conclusions, and
then take my leave of him, with many thanks for his politeness in
reading what I have written. Before completing my task in this way,
however, it will be well to add a word on the subject of one or two
of my fellow-travellers.
I never could make up my mind relating to the fact whether we did
or did not actually eat Brigadier Downright. The flesh was so savory,
and it tasted so delicious after a week of philosophical meditation
on nuts, and the recollection of its pleasures is so very vivid,
that I am inclined to think nothing but a good material dinner could
have left behind it impressions so lively, I have had many melancholy
thoughts on this subject, especially in November; but observing
that men are constantly devouring each other, in one shape or
another, I endeavor to make the best of it, and to persuade myself
that a slight difference in species may exonerate me from the
imputation of cannibalism.But, before he would bring himself to bear upon her, she must have
reached womanhood; and I also perceived that Jack must become a man before
the action of the story, as between him and Madeleine, could continue. An
interval of ten or fifteen years must therefore occur; and this was
arranged by sending Jack into the western wilderness of California, and
fixing the period as just preceding the date of the California gold fever
of '49.

Jack and Bryan were to be rivals for Madeleine; but artistic
considerations seemed to require that they should first meet and become
friends much in the same way that Jack and Madeleine had done. So I sent
Bryan to California, and made him the original discoverer of the precious
metal there; brought him and Jack together; and finally sent them to
England in each other's company. Jack, of course, as yet knows nothing of
his origin, and appears in London society merely as a natural genius and a
sculptor of wild animals.

By this time, I had begun to make Madeleine's acquaintance, and, in
consequence, to doubt the possibility of her becoming wholly evil, even
under the influence of Bryan Sinclair. Mrs. Denham. That is a vile injustice!

In another place, all manner of odd
superstitions and quasi-miracles are cropping up and gaining credence, as
if, since the immortality of the soul cannot be proved by logic, it should
be smuggled into belief by fraud and violence--that is, by the testimony
of the bodily senses themselves. Taking a comprehensive view of the whole
field, therefore, it seems to be divided between discreet and supercilious
skepticism on one side, and, on the other, the clamorous jugglery of
charlatanism. The case is not really so bad as that: nihilists are not
discreet and even the Bishop of Rome is not necessarily a charlatan.
The bells upon the church were rung with a mighty jovial cheer; For
it's just that I should tell you how (of all days in the year) This day
of our adversity was blessed Christmas morn, And the house above the
coast-guard's was the house where I was born.

Oh, well I saw the pleasant room, the pleasant faces there, My mother's
silver spectacles, my father's silver hair; And well I saw the firelight,
like a flight of homely elves, Go dancing round the china plates that
stand upon the shelves.

And well I knew the talk they had, the talk that was of me, Of the shadow
on the household, and the son that went to sea; And, oh, the wicked
fool I seemed, in every kind of way, To be here and hauling frozen
ropes on blessed Christmas Day.It is impossible, save at the cost of affectation
or of ignorance, to escape from the spirit of the age. It is in the air we
breathe, and, whether we are fully conscious thereof or not, our lives and
thoughts must needs be tinctured by it.

Now, art is creative; but Mephistopheles, the spirit that denies, is
destructive. A negative attitude of mind is not favorable for the
production of works of art. The best periods of art have also been periods
of spiritual or philosophical convictions. The more a man doubts, the more
he disintegrates and the less he constructs. By the side of the philosophic
tendency of the previous age, a mystical tendency appeared in
literature. The Kabbala, with its mist-shrouded symbolism, so grateful to
the feelings and the imagination, chimed in better than rationalistic
philosophy with the depressed humor under which the greater part of the
Jews were then laboring. Another force antagonistic to rationalistic
philosophy was the Rabbinism transplanted from France and Germany. The
controversy between Rabbinism and philosophy, which dragged itself through
three-quarters of a century (1232-1305), ended in the formal triumph of
Rabbinism.
However, philosophic activity merely languished, it did not cease entirely;
in fact, the three currents for some time ran along parallel with one
another. Next to the pillars of Rabbinism, Asheri, Rashba, Isaac ben Sheshet,
loomed up the philosophers, Gersonides (Ralbag), Kreskas, and Albo, and a
long line of Kabbalists, beginning with Nachmanides and Moses de Leon, the
compiler of the Zohar, and ending with the anonymous authors of the
mysterious "Kana and Pelia."
The times grew less and less propitious. Catholicism steadily gained ground
in Spain. The scowling Dominican put forward his claim upon the Jewish
soul with vehement emphasis, and made every effort to drag it into
the bosom of the alone-saving Church. The conversion of the Jews would
have been a great triumph, indeed, for Catholicism militant. The conversion
methods of the Dominican monk were of a most insinuating kind--he usually
began with a public religious disputation.
Unfortunately, the Jews were experts in the art of debate, and too often
by their bold replies covered the self-sufficient dignitaries of Rome with
confusion. The Jews should have known, from bitter experience, that such
boldness would not be passed over silently. From sumptuous debating hall
to Dominican prison and scaffold was but a short step. In 1391, one of
these worthy soul-catchers, Bishop Ferdinando Martinez, set the
fanatical mob of Seville on the Jews, and not without success.

Terrorized by the threat of death, many accepted Catholicism under duress.
But they became Christians only in appearance; in reality they remained
true to the faith of their fathers, and, in secret, running the risk
of loss of life, they fulfilled all the Jewish ordinances. This is the
prologue to the thrilling Marrano tragedy.

Finally, the moment approached when gloomy Catholicism attained to unchallenged
supremacy in the Pyrenean Peninsula. On the ruins of the enlightened
culture of the Arabs, Ferdinand the Catholic and Isabella of Castile reared
the reactionary government of medieval Rome. The Inquisition was introduced
(1480). Torquemada presided as high priest over the rites attending the
human sacrifices. _Ad gloriam ecclesiae_, the whole of Spain was illuminated.
Everywhere the funeral pyres of the Inquisition flared to the skies, the
air was rent by the despairing shrieks of martyrs enveloped in flames
or racked by tortures, the prisons overflowed with Marranos,--all instruments
of torture were vigorously plied.

At last the hour of redemption struck: in 1492 all Jews were driven from
Spain, and a few years later from Portugal. Jewish-Arabic culture after
five centuries of ascendency suffered a sudden collapse. The unhappy people
again grasped its staff, and wandered forth into the world without knowing
whither.

X
THE RABBINIC-MYSTICAL PERIOD, OR THE HEGEMONY OF THE GERMAN-POLISH JEWS
(1492-1789)

The expulsion from Spain was a stunning blow. The hoary martyr people which
had defied so many storms in its long life was for a moment dazed. The
soil of Europe was quaking under its feet. At the time when the medieval
period had formally come to a close for Occidental Christendom, and the
modern period had opened, the middle ages continued in unmitigated
brutality for the Jews. If anything, the life of the Jews had
become more unendurable than before.

What, indeed, had the much-vaunted modern age to offer them? In the ranks
of the humanistic movement Reuchlin alone stood forth prominently as the
advocate of the Jews, and he was powerless before the prejudices of the
populace. The Reformation in Germany and elsewhere had illuminated the minds
of the people, but had not softened their hearts. Luther himself, the
creator of the Reformation, was not innocent of hating the followers of
an alien faith. The Jews especially did not enjoy too great a measure of
his sympathies. The wars growing out of the Reformation, which in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries devastated Europe in the name of
religion, were not calculated to favor the spread of tolerance and milder
manners. The conflict raging in the bosom of the Church and setting her own
children by the ears, was yet insufficient to divert her maternal care
from her "unbelieving" stepchildren. In Spain and Portugal, stakes
continued to burn two centuries longer for the benefit of the Marranos,
the false Christians. In Germany and Austria, the Jews were kept in
the same condition of servitude as before. Their economic circumstances
were appalling. They were forced to emigrate _en masse_ to Poland,
which offered the adherents of their faith a comparatively quiet life, and
by and by was invested with the Jewish hegemony. Some of the smaller
states and independent towns of Italy also afforded the Jews an asylum,
though one not always to be depended upon. A group of hard-driven
Spanish exiles, for instance, under the leadership of Abarbanel had found
peace in Italy. The rest had turned to Turkey and her province Palestine,

For a time, indeed, the Jewish spiritual centre was located in Turkey.
What Europe, old, Christian, and hardhearted, refused the Jews, was
granted them by Turkey, young, Mussulman, and liberal. On hearing of the
banishment of the Jews from Spain, Sultan Bajazet exclaimed: "How
can you call Ferdinand of Aragon a wise king, the same Ferdinand who has
made his land poor and enriched ours?" His amazement characterizes the
relation of Turkey to the Jews of the day. The one-time Marrano, Joseph
Nassi, rose to be a considerable dignitary at the court of Sultan Selim
(1566-1580). Occasionally he succeeded, by diplomatic means, in wreaking
vengeance upon European courts in retaliation for the brutal tortures
inflicted upon his people. With the generosity of a Maecenas, he
assembled Jewish scholars and poets, and surrounded himself with a sunlit
atmosphere of intellectuality and talent. All other Jewish communities
looked up to that of Constantinople. Now and again its rabbis played the
part of Patriarchs of the synagogue. To this commanding position
the rabbis of Palestine especially were inclined to lay claim. They
even attempted to restore the Patriarchate, and the famous controversy
between Jacob Berab and Levi ben Chabib regarding the _Semicha_ is another
evidence of the same assertive tendency. Among the Spanish exiles settled
in the Holy Land a peculiar spiritual current set in. The storm-tossed
wanderers, but now returned to their native Jordan from the shores
of the blood-stained Tagus and Guadalquivir, were mightily moved at the
sight of their ancestral home. Ahasuerus, who on his thorn-strewn pilgrim's
path had drained the cup of woe to the dregs, suddenly caught sight of the
home of his childhood razed level with the ground. The precious,
never-to-be-forgotten ruins exhaled the home feeling, which took possession
of him with irresistible charm. Into his soul there flowed sweet memories
of a golden youth, past beyond recall. The impact of these emotions
enkindled passionate "longing for Zion" in the heart of the forlorn, homeless
martyr. He was seized by torturing thirst for political resurrection. Such
melancholy feelings and vehement outbursts found expression in the
practical Kabbala, originating with Ari (Isaac Luria) and his famous
Safed school. A mystical belief in the coming of Messiah thenceforward
became one of the essential elements of the Jewish spirit. It vanquished
the heart of the learned Joseph Karo, who had brought Rabbinism to
its climax by the compilation of his celebrated ritual code, the Shulchan
Aruch. With equal force it dominated the being of Solomon Molcho, the
enthusiastic youth who, at one time a Marrano, on his public return
to Judaism proclaimed the speedy regeneration of Israel. He sealed his faith
in his prophecy with death at the stake (1532). The Marranos beyond
the Pyrenees and the unfortunate Jews of Italy, who, in the second
half of the sixteenth century had to bear the brunt of papal fanaticism,
on the increase since the Reformation, were kept in a state of constant
excitement by this Messianic doctrine, with its obscure stirrings of hope.
A mournful national feeling pervades the Jewish literature of the time.
Recollections of torments endured enflamed all hearts. A series of
chronicles were thus produced that record the centuries of Jewish
martyrdom--_Jocha-sin, Shebet Jehuda, Emek ha-Bacha_, etc.
The art of printing, even then developed to a considerable degree of
perfection, became for the dispersed Jews the strongest bond of
spiritual union. The papal _index librorum prohibitorum_ was
impotent in the face of the all-pervading propaganda for thought and
feeling carried on by the printing press.

After Palestine and Turkey, Holland for a time became the spiritual
centre of the scattered Jews (in the seventeenth century).

Holland was warmly attached to the cause of liberty. When it succeeded in
freeing itself from the clutches of fanatical Spain and her rapacious
king, Philip II, it inaugurated the golden era of liberty of conscience,
of peaceful development in culture and industry, and granted an asylum
to the persecuted and abandoned of all countries. By the thousands the
harassed Ghetto sons, especially the Marranos from Spain and Portugal,
migrated to Holland. Amsterdam became a second Cordova. The intellectual
life was quickened. Freedom from restraint tended to break down
the national exclusivism of the Jew, and intercourse with his liberal
surroundings varied his mental pursuits. Rabbinism, the Kabbala, philosophy,
national poetry--they all had their prominent representatives in Holland.
These manifold tendencies were united in the literary activity of
Manasseh ben Israel, a scholar of extensive, though not intensive, encyclopedic
attainments. Free thought and religious rationalism were embodied in Uriel
Acosta. To a still higher degree they were illustrated in the theory of
life expounded by the immortal author of the "Theologico-Political Tractate"
(1640-1677).
This advanced state of culture in Holland did not fail to react upon
the neighboring countries. Under the impulse of enthusiasm for the
Bible Puritan England under Cromwell opened its portals to the
Jews.
In Italy, in the dank atmosphere of rabbinical dialectics and morbid
mysticism, great figures loom up--Leon de Modena, the antagonist of
Rabbinism and of the Kabbala, and Joseph del Medigo, mathematician,
philosopher, and mystic, the disciple of Galileo.

These purple patches were nothing more than the accidents of a transition
period. The people as a whole was on the decline. The Jewish mind darted
hither and thither, like a startled bird seeking its nest. Holland
or Turkey was an inadequate substitute for Spain, if only for the
reason that but a tiny fraction of the Jews had found shelter in either.
The Jewish national centre must perforce coincide with the numerical
centre of the dispersed people, in which, moreover, conditions must grant
Jews the possibility of living undisturbed in closely compacted masses,
and of perfecting a well-knit organization of social and individual
life. Outside of Spain these conditions were fulfilled only by Poland, which
gradually, beginning with the sixteenth century, assumed the hegemony over
the Jewry of the world.
This marks the displacement of the Sephardic (Spanish, in a broader
sense, Romanic) element, and the supremacy of the Ashkenazic
(German-Polish) element.

Poland had been a resort for Jewish immigrants from Germany since the
outbreak of the Crusades, until, in the sixteenth century, it rose
to the position of a Jewish centre of the first magnitude. As the
merchant middle class, the Jews were protected and advanced by the
kings and the Szlachta.

The consequent security of their position induced so rapid a growth of
the Jewish element that in a little while the Jews of Poland outnumbered
those of the old Jewish settlements in Occidental Europe. The numerous
privileges granted the Jews, by Boleslaus of Kalish (1246), Kasimir the
Great (1347-1370), Witowt (1388), Kasimir IV (1447), and some of their
successors, fortified their position in the extended territory covered by
Poland, Lithuania, and the Ukraine. Their peculiar circumstances in
Poland left an impress upon their inner life. An intense mental
activity was called forth. This activity can be traced back to German
beginnings, though at the same time it is made up of many original
elements. For a space Rabbinism monopolized the intellectual endeavors of
the Polish Jews.
The rabbi of Cracow, Moses Isserles, and the rabbi of Ostrog, Solomon
Luria (d. 1572), disputed first place with the foremost rabbinical
authorities of other countries.

Their decisions and circular letters regarding religious and legal questions
were accorded binding force.
Associates and successors of theirs founded Talmud academies throughout the
country, and large numbers of students attended them.
Commentators upon the Talmud and expounders of classical works in
Jewish theological literature appeared in shoals. Jewish printing establishments
in Cracow and Lublin were assiduous in turning out a mass of writings,
which spread the fame of the Polish rabbis to the remotest communities.
The large autonomy enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian Jews conferred
executive power upon rabbinical legislation.
The _Kahal_, or Jewish communal government, to a certain degree invested
with judicial and administrative competence, could not do without the
guiding hand of the rabbis as interpreters of the law. The guild of rabbis,
on their side, chose a "college of judges," with fairly extensive
jurisdiction, from among their own members. The organization of the
Rabbinical Conferences, or the "Synods of the Four Countries," formed
the keystone of this intricate social-spiritual hierarchy. The comprehensive
inner autonomy and the system of Talmud academies (_Yeshiboth_) that
covered the whole of Poland remind one of the brilliant days of the
Exilarchate and the Babylonia of the Geonim. One element was lacking, there
was no versatile, commanding thinker like Saadia Gaon. Secular knowledge
and philosophy were under the ban in Poland. Rabbinism absorbed the whole
output of intellectual energy. As little as the Poles resembled the Arabs
of the "golden age," did the Polish Jews resemble their brethren in faith
in the Orient at Saadia's time or in the Spain of Gabirol and
Maimonides.
Isolation and clannishness were inevitable in view of the character of
the Christian environment and the almost insuperable barriers
raised between the classes of Polish society.

But it was this exclusiveness that gave peculiar stability and completeness
to the life of the Jew as an individual and as a member of Jewish
society, and it was the same exclusiveness that afforded opportunity for
the development of a sharply defined culture, for its fixation to the
point of resisting violent shocks and beyond the danger point of extinction
through foreign invasion.

The fateful year 1648 formed a turning point in the history of the Polish
Jews, as in the history of the countries belonging to the Polish crown.
The Cossack butcheries and wars of extermination of 1648-1658 were the same
for the Polish Jews that the Crusades, the Black Death, and all the other
occasions for carnage had been for the Jews of Western Europe. It seemed
as though history desired to avoid the reproach of partiality, and hastened
to mete out even-handed justice by apportioning the same measure of woe
to the Jews of Poland as to the Jews of Western Europe. But the Polish
Jews were prepared to accept the questionable gift from the hands of history.
They had mounted that eminence of spiritual stability on which suffering
loses the power to weaken its victim, but, on the contrary, endues him
with strength. More than ever they shrank into their shell.

They shut themselves up more completely in their inner world, and became
morally dulled against the persecutions, the bitter humiliations,
the deep scorn, which their surroundings visited upon them. The Polish Jew
gradually accustomed himself to his pitiable condition. He hardly knew
that life might be other than it was. That the Polish lord to whom he was
a means of entertainment might treat him with a trace of respect, or
that his neighbors, the middle class merchant, the German guild
member, and the Little Russian peasant, might cherish kindly feelings
toward him, he could not conceive as a possibility. Seeing himself
surrounded by enemies, he took precautions to fortify his camp, not so
much to protect himself against hostile assaults from without--they
were inevitable--as to paralyze the disastrous consequences of
such assaults in his inner world.

To compass this end he brought into play all the means suggested by his
exceptional position before the law and by his own peculiar social
constitution. The _Kahal_, the autonomous rabbinical administration
of communal affairs, more and more assumed the character of an inner
dictatorship. Jewish society was persistently kept under the
discipline of rigid principles. In many affairs the synagogue attained the
position of a court of final appeal. The people were united, or rather
packed, into a solid mass by purely mechanical processes--by pressure
from without, and by drawing tight a noose from within. Besides
this social factor tending to consolidate the Jewish people into a
separate union, an intellectual lever was applied to produce the same result.
Rabbinism employed the mystical as its adjutant. The one exercised control
over all minds, the other over all hearts. The growth of mysticism was
fostered both by the unfortunate conditions under which the Polish
Jews endured existence and by the Messianic movements which made their
appearance among the Jews of other countries.

In the second half of the seventeenth century, mysticism reached its
zenith in Turkey, the country in which, had stood the cradle of the
"practical Kabbala." The teachings of Ari, Vital, and the school established
by them spread like wildfire. Messianic extravagances intoxicated the baited
and persecuted people. In Smyrna appeared the false Messiah, Sabbatai Zebi.
As by magic he attracted to himself a tremendous company of adherents in
the East and in the West. For a quarter of a century (1650-1676), he
kept the Jewish communities everywhere in a state of quivering suspense.

The harassed people tossed to and fro like a fever patient, and raved about
political re-birth. Its delirious visions still further heated its
agitated blood. It came to its senses but slowly. Not even the apostasy and
death of Sabbatai Zebi sufficed to sober all his followers. Under the
guise of a symbolic faith in a Messiah, many of them, publicly or secretly,
continued the propaganda for his doctrines.

This propaganda prepared the fertile soil from which, in the eighteenth
century, shot up Messianic systems, tending to split Judaism into sects.
Nowhere did the mystical teachings evoke so ready a response as in
Poland, the very centre of Judaism.

At first an ally of the rabbinical school, mysticism grown passionate and
uncontrollable now and again acted as the violent opponent of Rabbinism.
Secret devotion to the Sabbatian doctrines, which had made their home in
Poland, sometimes led to such extremes in dogma and ethics that the rabbis
could not contain themselves. Chayyim Malach, Judah Chassid, and other
Galician mystics, in the second decade of the eighteenth century
brought down upon themselves a rabbinical decree of excommunication.
The mystical tendency was the precursor of the heretical half-Christian
sect of Frankists, who ventured so far as to lift a hand against
the fundamentals of Judaism: they rejected the Talmud in favor of the Zohar
(1756-1773). At the same time a much more profound movement, instinct with
greater vitality, made its appearance among the Polish-Jewish masses, a
movement rooted in their social and spiritual organization. The wretched,
debased condition of the average Jew, conjoined with the traditions of
the Kabbala and the excrescences of Rabbinism, created a foothold for
Chassidic teaching. Chassidism replaced Talmudic ratiocination by exalted
religious sentiment. By the force of enthusiasm for faith, it drew its
adherents together into a firmly welded unit in contrast with Rabbinism,
which sought the same goal by the aid of the formal law. Scenting danger,
the rabbinical hierarchy declared war upon the Kabbala. Emden opposed
Eibeschütz, the Polish Sabbatians and Frankists were fought to the death,
the Wilna Gaon organized a campaign against the Chassidim. Too late!
Rabbinism was too old, too arid, to tone down the impulsive outbreaks
of passion among the people. In their religious exaltation the masses
were looking for an elixir. They were languishing, not for light to
illumine the reason, but for warmth to set the heart aglow. They desired
to lose themselves in ecstatic self-renunciation. Chassidism and its
necessary dependence upon the Zaddik offered the masses the means of
this forgetfulness of self through faith. They were the medium through which
the people saw the world in a rosy light, and the consequences following
upon their prevalence were seen in a marked intensification of Jewish
exclusiveness.

The same aloofness characterizes the Jews of the rest of the eighteenth
century diaspora. Wherever, as in Germany, Austria, and Italy, Jews
were settled in considerable numbers, they were separated from their
surroundings by forbidding Ghetto walls. On the whole, no difference
is noticeable between conditions affecting Jews in one country and
those in another. Everywhere they were merely tolerated, everywhere
oppressed and humiliated. The bloody persecutions of the middle
ages were replaced by the burden of the exceptional laws, which in
practice degraded the Jews socially to an inferior race, to citizens
of a subordinate degree. The consequences were uniformly the same
in all countries: spiritual isolation and a morbid religious mood.
During the first half of the "century of reason," Jewry presented
the appearance of an exhausted wanderer, heavily dragging himself
on his way, his consciousness clouded, his trend of thought obviously
anti-rationalistic. At the very moment in which Europe was beginning
to realize its medieval errors and repent of them, and the era of
universal ideals of humanity was dawning, Judaism raised barricades
between itself and the world at large. Elijah Gaon and Israel Besht
were the contemporaries of Voltaire and Rousseau.
Apparently there was no possibility of establishing communication
between these two diametrically opposed worlds. But history is a
magician. Not far from the Poland enveloped in medieval darkness,
the morning light of a new life was breaking upon slumbering Jewry
in German lands. New voices made themselves heard, reverberating
like an echo to the appeal issued by the "great century" in behalf
of a spiritual and social regeneration of mankind.

XI
THE MODERN PERIOD OF ENLIGHTENMENT (THE NINETEENTH CENTURY)
Two phenomena signalized the beginning of the latest period in
Jewish history: the lofty activity of Mendelssohn and the occurrence
of the great French Revolution.The experience in question is not of the ways of
the world,--concerning which Mr. James has every sign of being politely
familiar,--nor of men and women in their every-day aspect; still less of
literary ways and means, for of these, in his own line, he is a master.
The experience referred to is experience of passion. If Mr. James be not
incapable of describing passion, at all events he has still to show that
he is capable of it. He has introduced us to many characters that seem to
have in them capacity for the highest passion,--as witness Christina
Light,--and yet he has never allowed them an opportunity to develop it. He
seems to evade the situation; but the evasion is managed with so much
plausibility that, although we may be disappointed, or even irritated, and
feel, more or less vaguely, that we have been unfairly dealt with, we are
unable to show exactly where or how the unfairness comes in. Thus his
novels might be compared to a beautiful face, full of culture and good
breeding, but lacking that fire of the eye and fashion of the lip that
betray a living human soul.

The other one of the two writers whose names are so often mentioned
together, seems to have taken up the subject of our domestic and social
pathology; and the minute care and conscientious veracity which he has
brought to bear upon his work has not been surpassed, even by Shakespeare.
In this case, the future task of Jewish history will prove as sublime as
was the mission of the Jewish people in the past. The latter consisted
in the spread of the dogma of the unity of creation; the former
will contribute indirectly to the realization of the not yet accepted
dogma of the unity of the human race.

IV
THE HISTORICAL SYNTHESIS

To define the scope of Jewish history, its content and its significance,
or its place among scientific pursuits, disposes only of the formal part
of the task we have set ourselves. The central problem is to unfold the
meaning of Jewish history, to discover the principle toward which its
diversified phenomena converge, to state the universal laws and philosophic
inferences deducible from the peculiar course of its events. If we liken
history to an organic being, then the skeleton of facts is its
body, and the soul is the spiritual bond that unites the facts into
a whole, that conveys the meaning, the psychologic essence, of the
facts.

It becomes our duty, then, to unbare the soul of Jewish history, or, in
scientific parlance, to construct, on the basis of the facts, the synthesis
of the whole of Jewish national life. To this end, we must pass in
review, by periods and epochs, one after another, the most important groups
of historical events, the most noteworthy currents in life and thought
that tell of the stages in the development of Jewry and of Judaism.
Exhaustive treatment of the philosophical synthesis of a history
extending over three thousand years is possible only in a voluminous work.
In an essay like the present it can merely be sketched in large outline,
or painted in miniature. We cannot expect to do more than state a series
of general principles substantiated by the most fundamental arguments.
Complete demonstration of each of the principles must be sought in the
annals that recount the events of Jewish history in detail.

The historical synthesis reduces itself, then, to uncovering the psychologic
processes of national development. The object before us to be studied
is the national spirit undergoing continuous evolution during thousands
of years. Our task is to arrive at the laws underlying this growth. We shall
reach our goal by imitating the procedure of the geologist, who divides the
mass of the earth into its several strata or formations. In Jewish history
there may be distinguished three chief stratifications answering to
its first three periods, the Biblical period, the period of the Second
Temple, and the Talmudic period. The later periods are nothing more than
these same formations combined in various ways, with now and then the
addition of new strata. Of the composite periods there are four, which
arrange themselves either according to hegemonies, the countries in
which at given times lay the centre of gravity of the scattered Jewish
people, or according to the intellectual currents there predominant.

This, then, is our scheme:

I. The chief formations:
a) The primary or Biblical period.
b) The secondary or spiritual-political period (the period of the Second
Temple, 538 B. C. E. to 70 C.E.) c) The tertiary or national-religious
period (the Talmudic period, 70-500).

II. The composite formations:
a) The Gaonic period, or the hegemony of the Oriental Jews (500-980).

b) The Rabbinic-philosophical period, or the hegemony of the Spanish
Jews (980-1492).
c) The Rabbinic-mystical period, or the hegemony of the
German-Polish Jews (1492-1789).
d) The modern period of enlightenment (the nineteenth century).

V

THE PRIMARY OR BIBLICAL PERIOD
In the daybreak of history, the hoary days when seeming and reality
merge into each other, and the outlines of persons and things fade
into the surrounding mist, the picture of a nomad people, moving
from the deserts of Arabia in the direction of Mesopotamia and
Western Asia, detaches itself clear and distinct from the dim
background.

The tiny tribe, a branch of the Semitic race, bears a peculiar stamp
of its own.

A shepherd people, always living in close touch with nature, it yet resists
the potent influence of the natural phenomena, which, as a rule, entrap
primitive man, and make him the bond-slave of the visible and material.
Tent life has attuned these Semitic nomads to contemplativeness. In the
endless variety of the phenomena of nature, they seek to discover a single
guiding power. They entertain an obscure presentiment of the existence
of an invisible, universal soul animating the visible, material
universe. The intuition is personified in the Patriarch Abraham, who,
according to Biblical tradition, held communion with God, when, on the
open field, "he looked up toward heaven, and counted the stars," or when,
"at the setting of the sun, he fell into benumbing sleep, and terror
seized upon him by reason of the impenetrable darkness." Here we have a
clear expression of the original, purely cosmical character of the
Jewish religion.

There was no lack of human influence acting from without. Chaldea, which
the peculiar Semitic shepherds crossed in their pilgrimage, presented
them with notions from its rich mythology and cosmogony. The natives of
Syria and Canaan, among whom in the course of time the Abrahamites settled,
imparted to them many of their religious views and customs. Nevertheless,
the kernel of their pure original theory remained intact. The patriarchal
mode of life, admirable in its simplicity, continued to hold its own
within the circle of the firmly-knitted tribe. It was in Canaan, however,
that the shepherd people hailing from Arabia showed the first signs of
approaching disintegration. Various tribal groups, like Moab and Ammon,
consolidated themselves. They took permanent foothold in the land,
and submitted with more or less readiness to the influences exerted
by the indigenous peoples.

The guardianship of the sublime traditions of the tribe remained with one
group alone, the "sons of Jacob" or the "sons of Israel," so named from
the third Patriarch Jacob. To this group of the Israelites composed of
smaller, closely united divisions, a special mission was allotted; its
development was destined to lie along peculiar lines. The fortunes
awaiting it were distinctive, and for thousands of years have filled
thinking and believing mankind with wondering admiration.

Great characters are formed under the influence of powerful impressions, of
violent convulsions, and especially under the influence of suffering. The
Israelites early passed through their school of suffering in Egypt.
The removal of the sons of Jacob from the banks of the Jordan to those of
the Nile was of decisive importance for the progress of their history.
When the patriarchal Israelitish shepherds encountered the old, highly
complex culture of the Egyptians, crystallized into fixed forms even at
that early date, it was like the clash between two opposing electric currents.
The pure conception of God, of _Elohim_, as of the spirit informing and
supporting the universe, collided with the blurred system of heathen
deities and crass idolatry. The simple cult of the shepherds, consisting
of a few severely plain ceremonies, transmitted from generation to generation,
was confronted with the insidious, coarsely sensual animal worship of
the Egyptians. The patriarchal customs of the Israelites were brought into
marked contrast with the vices of a corrupt civilization. Sound in body
and soul, the son of nature suddenly found himself in unsavory surroundings
fashioned by culture, in which he was as much despised as the inoffensive
nomad is by "civilized" man of settled habit. The scorn had a practical
result in the enslavement of the Israelites by the Pharaohs. Association
with the Egyptians acted as a force at once of attraction and of
repulsion.
The manners and customs of the natives could not fail to leave an
impression upon the simple aliens, and invite imitation on their
part.
On the other hand, the whole life of the Egyptians, their crude notions of
religion, and their immoral ways, were calculated to inspire the
more enlightened among the Israelites with disgust.

The hostility of the Egyptians toward the "intruders," and the horrible
persecutions in which it expressed itself, could not but bring out more
aggressively the old spiritual opposition between the two races.
The antagonism between them was the first influence to foster the germ of
Israel's national consciousness, the consciousness of his peculiar
character, his individuality. This early intimation of a national
consciousness was weak. It manifested itself only in the chosen few.
But it existed, and the time was appointed when, under more favorable
conditions, it would develop, and display the extent of its power.

This consciousness it was that inspired the activity of Moses, Israel's
teacher and liberator. He was penetrated alike by national and
religious feeling, and his desire was to impart both national and religious
feeling to his brethren. The fact of national redemption he connected
with the fact of religious revelation. "I am the Lord thy God who
have brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt" was proclaimed from Sinai.
The God-idea was nationalized. Thenceforth "Eternal" became the name
peculiar to the God of Israel. He was, indeed, the same _Elohim_, the
Creator of the world and its Guide, who had been dimly discerned by the
spiritual vision of the Patriarchs. At the same time He was the special
God of the Israelitish nation, the only nation that avouched Him with a
full and undivided heart, the nation chosen by God Himself to carry out,
alone, His sublime plans.[9] In his wanderings, Israel became acquainted
with the chaotic religious systems of other nations. Seeing to what they
paid the tribute of divine adoration, he could not but be dominated by the
consciousness that he alone from of old had been the exponent of the
religious idea in its purity. The resolution must have ripened within him
to continue for all time to advocate and cherish this idea. From that
moment Israel was possessed of a clear theory of life in religion
and morality, and of a definite aim pursued with conscious intent.

[9] This is the true recondite meaning of the verses Exod. vi, 2-3: "And
God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Eternal: and I appeared
unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as _El-Shaddai_ (God Almighty),
but by my name Eternal I was not known unto them."
Its originators designed that this Israelitish conception of life should
serve not merely theoretically, as the basis of religious doctrine,
but also practically, as the starting point of legislation.
It was to be realized in the daily walks of the people, which at this very
time attained to political independence. Sublime religious conceptions
were not to be made the content of a visionary creed, the subject of
dreamy contemplation, but, in the form of perspicuous guiding
principles, were to control all spheres of individual and social
life.

Men must beware of looking upon religion as an ideal to be yearned for,
it should be an ideal to be applied directly, day by day, to
practical contingencies. In "Mosaism," so-called, the religious and
the ethical are intimately interwoven with the social and the political.
The chief dogmas of creed are stated as principles shaping practical life.
For instance, the exalted idea of One God applied to social life
produces the principle of the equality of all men before the One Supreme
Power, a principle on which the whole of Biblical legislation is built. The
commands concerning love of neighbor, the condemnation of slavery, the
obligation to aid the poor, humane treatment of the stranger, sympathy
and compassion with every living being--all these lofty injunctions
ensue as inevitable consequences from the principle of equality. Biblical
legislation is perhaps the only example of a political and social code
based, not upon abstract reasoning alone, but also upon the
requirements of the feelings, upon the finest impulses of the human soul.
By the side of formal right and legality, it emphasizes, and, in a series
of precepts, makes tangible, the principle of justice and humanity.
The Mosaic law is a "propaganda by deed." Everywhere it demands active,
more than passive, morality. Herein, in this elevated characteristic,
this vital attribute, consists the chief source of the power of Mosaism.
The same characteristic, to be sure, prevented it from at once gaining
ground in the national life. It established itself only gradually, after
many fluctuations and errors. In the course of the centuries, and keeping
pace with the growth of the national consciousness, it was cultivated
and perfected in detail.

The conquest of Canaan wrought a radical transformation in the life of the
Israelitish people. The acquiring of national territory supplied firm ground
for the development and manifold application of the principles of Mosaism.
At first, however, advance was out of the question. The mass of the
people had not reached the degree of spiritual maturity requisite for the
espousal of principles constituting an exalted theory of life. It
could be understood and represented only by a thoughtful minority,
which consisted chiefly of Aaronites and Levites, together forming a priestly
estate, though not a hierarchy animated by the isolating spirit of caste
that flourished among all the other peoples of the Orient. The populace
discovered only the ceremonial side of the religion; its kernel was
hidden from their sight. Defective spiritual culture made the people
susceptible to alien influences, to notions more closely akin to its
understanding. Residence in Canaan, among related Semitic tribes
that had long before separated from the Israelites, and adopted altogether
different views and customs, produced a far greater metamorphosis in the
character of the Israelites than the sojourn in Egypt. After the first
flush of victory, when the unity of the Israelitish people had been
weakened by the particularistic efforts of several of the tribes, the
spiritual bonds confining the nation began to relax. Political decay always
brings religious defection in its train. Whenever Israel came under the
dominion of the neighboring tribes, he also fell a victim to their cult.
This phenomenon is throughout characteristic of the so-called era of the
Judges.

It is a natural phenomenon readily explained on psychologic grounds. The
Mosaic national conception of the "Eternal" entered more and more
deeply into the national consciousness, and, accommodating itself to the
limited mental capacity of the majority, became narrower and narrower in
compass--the lot of all great ideas! The "Eternal" was no longer thought
of as the only One God of the whole universe, but as the tutelar deity
of the Israelitish tribe. The idea of national tutelar deities was at that
time deeply rooted in the consciousness of all the peoples of Western Asia.
Each nation, as it had a king of its own, had a tribal god of its own.
The Phoenicians had their Baal, the Moabites their Kemosh, the Ammonites
their Milkom. Belief in the god peculiar to a nation by no means excluded
belief in the existence of other national gods. A people worshiped
its own god, because it regarded him as its master and protecting
lord. In fact, according to the views then prevalent, a conflict
between two nations was the conflict between two national deities.
In the measure in which respect for the god of the defeated party
waned, waxed the number of worshipers of the god of the victorious
nation, and not merely among the conquerors, but also among the
adherents of other religions.[10] These crude, coarsely materialistic
conceptions of God gained entrance with the masses of the Israelitish
people. If Moab had his Kemosh, and Ammon his Milkom, then Israel
had his "Eternal," who, after the model of all other national gods,
protected and abandoned his "clients" at pleasure, in the one case
winning, in the other losing, the devotion of his partisans.Surely not. It is a new departure in history; it is a new door
opened to the development of the human race, or, as I should prefer to
say, of humanity. In view lives in of the Roman and Empire were,( its

Now, what is to be understood from this passage? 

[10] "Ye have forsaken me," says God unto Israel, "and served other gods;
wherefore I will deliver you no more. Go and cry unto the gods which ye
have chosen: let them deliver you in the time of your tribulations"
(Judges X, 13-14). The same idea is brought out still more forcibly in
the arguments adduced by Jephthah in his message to the king of Ammon (more
correctly, Moab), who had laid claim to Israelitish lands:
"Thou," says Jephthah, "mayest possess that which Kemosh thy god giveth thee
to possess, but what the Lord our God giveth us to possess, that will
we possess" (Judges xi, 24). Usually these words are taken ironically;
to me they seem to convey literal truth rather than irony.

The Prophet Samuel, coming after the unsettled period of the Judges,
had only partial success in purifying the views of the people and
elevating it out of degradation to a higher spiritual level. His work was
continued with more marked results in the brilliant reigns of Saul,
David, and Solomon. An end was put to the baleful disunion among the
tribes, and the bond of national tradition was strengthened. The consolidated
Israelitish kingdom triumphed over its former oppressors.
The gods of the strange peoples cringed in the dust before the
all-powerful "Eternal." But, with the division of the kingdom and the
political rupture between Judah and Israel, the period of efflorescence
soon came to an end. Again confusion reigned supreme, and customs and
convictions deteriorated under foreign influence.
Prophets like Elijah and Elisha, feverish though their activity was, stood
powerless before the rank immorality in the two states. The northern
kingdom of Israel, composed of the Ten Tribes, passed swiftly downward
on the road to destruction, sharing the fate of the numberless Oriental
states whose end was inevitable by reason of inner decay. The inspired
words of the early Israelitish Prophets, Amos, Hosea, and Micah, their
trumpet-toned reproofs, their thrilling admonitions, died unheeded
upon the air--society was too depraved to understand their import.

It was reserved for later generations to give ear to their immortal
utterances, eloquent witnesses to the lofty heights to which the
Jewish spirit was permitted to mount in times of general decline. The
northern kingdom sank into irretrievable ruin.
Then came the turn of Judah. He, too, had disregarded the law of
"sanctification" from Sinai, and had nearly arrived at the point of
stifling his better impulses in the morass of materialistic living.

At this critical moment, on the line between to be and not to be, a miracle
came to pass. The spirit of the people, become flesh in its noblest
sons, rose aloft. From out of the midst of the political disturbances, the
frightful infamy, and the moral corruption, resounded the impressive call
of the great Prophets of Judah. Like a flaming torch carried through
dense darkness, they cast a glaring light upon the vices of society, at
the same time illuminating the path that leads upward to the goal of the
ethical ideal. At first the negative, denouncing element predominated in
the exhortations of the Prophets: unsparingly they scourged the
demoralization and the iniquity, the social injustice and the
political errors prevalent in their time; they threatened divine
punishment, that is, the natural consequences of evil-doing, and
appealed to the reason rather than the feelings of the people.

But gradually they elaborated positive ideals, more soul-stirring than the
ideals identified with the old religious tradition. The Prophets were
the first to touch the root of the evil.
It is clear that they realized that alien influences and the low grade
of intelligence possessed by the masses were not the sole causes of the
frequent backsliding of the people. The Jewish doctrine itself bore
within it the germ of error. The two chief pillars of the old faith--the
nationalizing of the God-idea, and the stress laid upon the cult, the
ceremonial side of religion, as compared with moral requirements--were
first and foremost to be held responsible for the flagrant departures from
the spirit of Judaism. This was the direction in which reform was needed.
Thereafter the sermons of the Prophets betray everywhere the intense
desire, on the one hand, to restore to the God-idea its original universal
character, and, on the other hand, while strongly emphasizing the importance
of morality in the religious and the social sphere, to derogate from
the value of the ceremonial system. The "Eternal" is no longer the
national God of Israel, belonging to him exclusively; He becomes
the God of the whole of mankind, the same _Elohim_, Creator and
Preserver of the world, whom the Patriarchs had worshiped, and to
whom, being His creatures, all men owe worship.The
restrictions, the traditions, the law, and the license of those old
countries are full of suggestions to the student of character and
circumstances, and supply him with colors and effects that he would else
search for in vain. For the truth may as well be admitted; we are at a
distinct disadvantage, in America, in respect of the materials of romance.
Not that vigorous, pathetic, striking stories may not be constructed here;
and there is humor enough, the humor of dialect, of incongruity of
character; but, so far as the story depends for its effect, not upon
psychical and personal, but upon physical and general events and
situations, we soon feel the limit of our resources. Such as it was, it
could not consent to ally itself with _parvenus_, ennobled but to-day,
and yesterday still bowing down before "gods of silver and gods of gold."
This white-haired old man, with a stormy past full of experiences and
thought, would not mingle with the scatter-brained crowd, would not
descend to the level of neophytes dominated by fleeting, youthful enthusiasm.
Loyally this weather-bronzed, inflexible guardian of the Law stuck to his
post--the post entrusted to him by God Himself--and, faithful to his
duty, held fast to the principle _j'y suis, j'y reste_.

As a political nation threatened by its neighbors seeks support in its
army, and provides sufficient implements of war, so a spiritual nation must
have spiritual weapons of defense at its command. Such weapons
were forged in great numbers, and deposited in the vast arsenal called
the Talmud. The Talmud represents a complicated spiritual discipline,
enjoining unconditional obedience to a higher invisible power. Where
discipline is concerned, questions as to the necessity for one or another
regulation are out of place. Every regulation is necessary, if only because
it contributes to the desired end, namely, discipline.
Let no one ask, then, to what purpose the innumerable religious
and ritual regulations, sometimes reaching the extreme of pettiness, to
what purpose the comprehensive code in which every step in the life of the
faithful is foreseen. The Talmudic religious provisions, all taken together,
aim to put the regimen of the nation on a strictly uniform basis, so that
everywhere the Jew may be able to distinguish a brother in faith by
his peculiar mode of life. It is a uniform with insignia, by which soldiers
of the same regiment recognize one another. Despite the vast extent of the
Jewish diaspora, the Jews formed a well-articulated spiritual army, an
invisible "state of God" (_civitas dei_). Hence these "knights of the
spirit," the citizens of this invisible state, had to wear a distinct
uniform, and be governed by a suitable code of army regulations.

As a protection for Jewish national unity, which was exposed to the greatest
danger after the downfall of the state, there arose and developed,
without any external influence whatsoever, an extraordinary dictatorship,
unofficial and spiritual. The legislative activity of all the
dictators--such as, Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai, Rabbi Akiba, the
Hillelites, and the Shammaites--was formulated in the Mishna, the "oral
law," which was the substructure of the Talmud. Their activity
had a characteristic feature, which deserves somewhat particularized
description. The laws were not laid down arbitrarily and without ceremony.
In order to possess binding force, they required the authoritative
confirmation to be found in the Mosaic Books. From these, whether by logical
or by forced interpretation of the holy text, its words, or, perchance,
its letters, they had to be derived.
Each law, barring only the original "traditions," the _Halacha le-Moshe
mi-Sinai_, was promulgated over the supreme signature, as it were, that is,
with the authentication of a word from the Holy Scriptures. Or it was
inferred from another law so authenticated. The elaboration of every
law was thus connected with a very complicated process of thought,
requiring both inductive and deductive reasoning, and uniting
juridical interpretation with the refinements of casuistry. This legislation
was the beginning of Talmudic science, which from that time on, for many
centuries, growing with the ages, claimed in chief part the
intellectual activity of Jewry. The schools and the academies
worked out a system of laws at once religious and practical in character,
which constituted, in turn, the object of further theoretic study in
the same schools and academies. In the course of time, however, the means
became the end. Theoretic investigation of the law, extending and
developing to the furthest limits, in itself, without reference to its
practical value, afforded satisfaction to the spiritual need. The
results of theorizing often attained the binding force of law in practical
life, not because circumstances ordered it, but simply because one or another
academy, by dint of logic or casuistry, had established it as law. The
number of such deductions from original and secondary laws increased
in geometric progression, and practical life all but failed to keep
up with the theory.

The "close of the Mishna," that is, its reduction to writing, had no
daunting effect upon the zeal for research. If anything, a new and strong
impetus was imparted to it. As up to that time the text of the Holy
Scriptures had been made the basis of interpretation, giving rise to
the most diverse inferences, so the rabbis now began to use the law
book recently canonized as a new basis of interpretation, and to carry its
principles to their utmost consequences. In this way originated first the
"Palestinian Gemara." Later, when the Patriarchate in Palestine was
stripped of its glory by persecutions, and, in consequence, the
centre of activity had to be transferred from the Talmud academies of
Palestine to those of Babylonia, supreme place and exclusive dominion
were obtained by the "Babylonian Gemara," put into permanent form
about the year 500 C. E., a gigantic work, the result of two
hundred years of mental labor.

This busy intellectual activity was as comprehensive as it was
thoroughgoing. Talmudic legislation, the Halacha, by no means confines
itself to religious practices, extensive as this field is. It
embraces the whole range of civil and social life. Apart from the
dietary laws, the regulations for the festivals and the divine
service, and a mass of enactments for the shaping of daily life,
the Talmud elaborated a comprehensive and fairly well-ordered system
of civil and criminal law, which not infrequently bears favorable
comparison with the famous _rationi scriptae_ of the Romans.

While proceeding with extreme rigor and scrupulousness in ritual
matters, the Talmud is governed in its social legislation by the noblest
humanitarian principles.
Doubtless this difference of attitude can be explained by the fact
that religious norms are of very much greater importance for a nation
than judicial regulations, which concern themselves only with the interests
of the individual, and exercise but little influence upon the development
of the national spirit.

The most sympathetic aspects of the Jewish spirit in that epoch are revealed
in the moral and poetic elements of the Talmud, in the Agada.
They are the receptacles into which the people poured all its sentiments,
its whole soul. They are a clear reflex of its inner world, its feelings,
hopes, ideals. The collective work of the nation and the trend of
history have left much plainer traces in the Agada than in the dry, methodical
Halacha. In the Agada the learned jurist and formalist appears
transformed into a sage or poet, conversing with the people in a warm,
cordial tone, about the phenomena of nature, history, and life. The
reader is often thrown into amazement by the depth of thought and the
loftiness of feeling manifested in the Agada.

Involuntarily one pays the tribute of reverence to its practical wisdom,
to its touching legends pervaded by the magic breath of poesy, to
the patriarchal purity of its views. But these pearls are not strung upon
one string, they are not arranged in a complete system.
They are imbedded here and there, in gay variety, in a vast mass of
heterogeneous opinions and sentiments naive at times and at times eccentric.
The reader becomes aware of the thoughts before they are consolidated.
They are still in a fluid, mobile state, still in process of making. The
same vivacious, versatile spirit is revealed in the Midrashim
literature, directly continuing the Agada up to the end of the middle
ages. These two species of Jewish literature, the Agada and the Midrashim,
have a far greater absolute value than the Halacha.
The latter is an official work, the former a national product. Like every
other special legislation, the Halacha is bound to definite conditions and
times, while the Agada concerns itself with the eternal verities.
The creations of the philosophers, poets, and moralists are more permanent
than the work of legislators.

Beautiful as the Agada is, and with all its profundity, it lacks breadth.
It rests wholly on the national, not on a universal basis. It would be
vain to seek in it for the comprehensive universalism of the Prophets.
Every lofty ideal is claimed as exclusively Jewish. So far from bridging
over the chasm between Israel and the other nations, knowledge and
morality served to widen it. It could not be otherwise, there was no influx
of air from without. The national horizon grew more and more contracted.
The activities of the people gathered intensity, but in the same measure
they lost in breadth. It was the only result to be expected
from the course of history in those ages.
Let us try to conceive what the first five centuries of the Christian
era, the centuries during which the Talmud was built up, meant in the
life of mankind. Barbarism, darkness, and elemental outbreaks of man's
migratory instincts, illustrated by the "great migration of races,"
are characteristic features of those centuries. It was a wretched transition
period between the fall of the world of antique culture and the first
germinating of a new Christian civilization. The Orient, the centre and
hearth of Judaism, was shrouded in impenetrable darkness.
In Palestine and in Babylonia, their two chief seats, the Jews were
surrounded by nations that still occupied the lowest rung of the
ladder of civilization, that had not yet risen above naive mysticism
in religion, or continued to be immersed in superstitions of the
grossest sort.

In this abysmal night of the middle ages, the lamp of thought was fed and
guarded solely and alone by the Jews. It is not astonishing, then, that
oblivious of the other nations they should have dispensed light only
for themselves. Furthermore, the circumstance must be considered that, in
the period under discussion, the impulse to separate from Judaism gained
ground in the Christian world. After the Council of Nicaea, after
Constantine the Great had established Christianity as the state-church,
the official breach between the Old Testament and the New Testament partisans
became unavoidable.

Thus the Jews, robbed of their political home, created a spiritual home for
themselves. Through the instrumentality of the numberless religious
rules which the Talmud had laid down, and which shaped the life of the
individual as well as that of the community, they were welded into a firmly
united whole. The Jewish spirit--national feeling and individual mental
effort alike--was absorbed in this pursuit of unification. Head, heart,
hands, all human functions of the Jew, were brought under complete control
and cast into fixed forms, by these five centuries of labor. With painful
exactitude, the Talmud prescribed ordinances for all the vicissitudes of
life, yet, at the same time, offered sufficient food for brain and heart.
It was at once a religion and a science. The Jew was equipped with
all the necessaries. He could satisfy his wants from his own store. There
was no need for him to knock at strange doors, even though he had thereby
profited. The consequences of this attitude, positive as well as
negative consequences, asserted themselves in the further course of Jewish
history.

VIII
THE GAONIC PERIOD, OR THE HEGEMONY OF THE ORIENTAL JEWS (500-980)

With the close of the Talmud, at the beginning of the sixth century, the
feverish intellectual activity abated. The Jewish centre of gravity continued
in Babylonia. In this country, in which the Jewish race had heard its
cradle song at the dawn of existence, and later on _Judaea capta_ had
sat and wept remembering Zion, Judaism, after the destruction of the
second Temple and hundreds of years of trials, was favored with a secure
asylum. In the rest of the diaspora, persecution gave the Jews no respite,
but in Babylonia, under Persian rule, they lived for some centuries
comparatively free from molestation. Indeed, they enjoyed a measure of
autonomy in internal affairs, under a chief who was entitled Exilarch
(_Resh-Galutha_).
The Law and the word of God went forth from Babylonia for the Jews
of all lands. The Babylonian Talmud became the anthoritative code for
the Jewish people, a holy book second only to the Bible. The intellectual
calm that supervened at the beginning of the sixth century and lasted until
the end of the eighth century, betrayed itself in the slackening of independent
creation, though not in the flagging of intellectual activity in
general.

In the schools and academies of Pumbeditha, Nahardea, and Sura,
scientific work was carried on with the same zest as before, only
this work had for its primary object the sifting and exposition of
the material heaped up by the preceding generations.

This was the province of the Sabureans and the Geonim, whose relation
to the Talmud was the same as that of the Scribes (the _Soferim_)
of the Second Temple to the Bible (see above, ch. vi).

In the later period, as in the earlier, the aim was the capitalization of
the accumulated spiritual treasures, an undertaking that gives little
occasion for movement and life, but all the more for endurance and
industry.

This intellectual balance was destroyed by two events: the appearance of
Islam and the rise of Karaism. Islam, the second legitimate offspring of
Judaism, was appointed to give to religious thought in the slumbering Orient
the slight impulse it needed to start it on its rapid career of sovereign
power. Barely emancipated from swaddling clothes, young Hotspur at once
began to rage. He sought an outlet for his unconquerable thirst for action,
his lust for world-dominion. The victorious religious wars of the followers
of Allah ensued. This foreign movement was not without significance for
the fate of the Jews. They were surrounded no longer by heathens but by
Mohammedans, who believed in the God of the Bible, and through the mouth
of their prophet conferred upon the Jews the honorable appellation of "the
People of the Book." In the eighth century the wars ceased, and the impetuous
energy of the rejuvenated Orient was diverted into quieter channels. The
Bagdad Khalifate arose, the peaceful era of the growth of industry, the
sciences, and the arts was inaugurated. Endowed with quick discernment for
every enlightening movement, the Jews yielded to the vivifying magic of
young Arabic culture.

Partly under the influence of the Arabic tendency to split into religio-philosophic
sects, partly from inner causes, Karaism sprang up in the second half of
the eighth century. Its active career began with a vehement protest against
the Talmud as the regulator of life and thought. It proclaimed the
creators of this vast encyclopedia to be usurpers of spiritual power, and
urged a return to the Biblical laws in their unadulterated simplicity.

The weakness of its positive principles hindered the spread of Karaism,
keeping it forever within the narrow limits of a sect and consigning
it to stagnation. What gave it vogue during the first century of its
existence was its negative strength, its violent opposition to the Talmud,
which aroused strenuous intellectual activity. For a long time it
turned Judaism away from its one-sided Talmudic tendency, and opened up
new avenues of work for it. True to their motto: "Search diligently
in the Holy Scriptures," the adherents of Karaism applied themselves to
the rational study of the Bible, which had come to be, among the Talmudists,
the object of casuistic interpretation and legendary adornment.
By the cultivation of grammar and lexicography as applied to the Biblical
thesaurus of words, they resuscitated the Hebrew language, which,
ousted by the Aramaic dialect, had already sunk into oblivion. By
the same means they laid the foundation of a school of rejuvenated
poetry. In general, thought on religious and philosophic subjects
was promoted to a higher degree by the lively discussions between
them and the Talmudists.
By imperceptible steps Talmudic Judaism, influenced at once by the
enlightened Arabs and the protesting Karaites, departed from the
"four ells of the Halacha," and widened its horizon.The Bible may be
literature to Mr. Matthew Arnold, because he reads it for fun; but to
Luther, Calvin, or the pupils of a Sunday-school, it is essentially
something else. Literature is the written communications of the soul of
mankind with itself; it is liable to appear in the most unexpected places,
and in the oddest company; it vanishes when we would grasp it, and appears
when we look not for it. Still, beast irks beast on occasion. One Christmas
night of snow, Came father and son to words--such words! more
cruel because the blow To crown each word was wanting, while taunt matched
gibe, and curse Competed with oath in wager, like pastime in hell,--nay,
worse:
For pastime turned to earnest, as up there sprang at last The son at the
throat of the father, seized him, and held him fast.

"Out of this house you go!"--there followed a hideous oath-- "This oven
where now we bake, too hot to hold us both!

If there's snow outside, there's coolness: out with you, bide a spell In
the drift, and save the sexton the charge of a parish shell!"
Now, the old trunk was tough, was solid as stump of oak Untouched at the
core by a thousand years: much less had its seventy broke One whipcord
nerve in the muscly mass from neck to shoulder-blade Of the mountainous
man, whereon his child's rash hand like a feather weighed.

Nevertheless at once did the mammoth shut his eyes, Drop chin to breast,
drop hands to sides, stand stiffened,--arms and thighs All of a piece--struck
mute, much as a sentry stands, Patient to take the enemy's fire: his
captain so commands.

Whereat the son's wrath flew to fury at such sheer scorn Of his puny
strength by the giant eld thus acting the babe new-born:
And "Neither will this turn serve!" yelled he. "Out with you! Trundle,
log!
If you cannot tramp and trudge like a man, try all-fours like a dog!"
Still the old man stood mute. So, logwise,--down to floor Pulled from his
fireside place, dragged on from hearth to door,-- Was he pushed, a very
log, staircase along, until A certain turn in the steps was reached, a yard
from the house-door sill.

Then the father opened his eyes,--each spark of their rage extinct,--
Temples, late black, dead-blanched, right-hand with left-hand
linked,-- He faced his son submissive; when slow the accents came,
They were strangely mild though his son's rash hand on his neck lay
all the same.
"Halbert, on such a night of a Christmas long ago, For such a cause,
with such a gesture, did I drag--so-- My father down thus far: but,
softening here, I heard A voice in my heart, and stopped: you wait
for an outer word.Moses says to Israel:
"Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen
thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon
the face of the earth. The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose
you, because ye were more in number than any people: for ye were the
fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you...." (Deut.
vii, 6-8).
And these are the words of the prophecy: "Listen, O isles, unto me, and
hearken, ye people, from far! The Lord hath called me... and said unto
me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified! But I
had thought, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought,
and in vain; yet surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my
God.
For now said the Lord unto me... It is too light a thing that
thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and
to restore the preserved of Israel: no, I will also give thee for a light
to the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach unto the end of the earth"
(Is. xlix, 1-6).

These sublime teachings were inculcated at the moment in which Judah was
hastening to meet his fate. It had become impossible to check the natural
results of the earlier transgressions. The inevitable happened; Babylon
the mighty laid her ponderous hand upon tiny Judah.
But Judah could not be crushed. From the heavy chastisement the Jewish
nation emerged purified, re-born for a new life.

VI
THE SECONDARY OR SPIRITUAL-POLITICAL PERIOD

The rank and file of a people are instructed by revolutions and
catastrophes better than by sermons. More quickly than Isaiah and Jeremiah,
Nebuchadnezzar brought the Jews to a recognition of their tasks. The short
span of the Babylonian Exile (586-538 B. C. E.) was a period of
introspection and searching self-examination for the people.
Spiritual forces hitherto latent came into play; a degree of
self-consciousness asserted itself. The people grasped its mission. At
last it comprehended that to imitate inferior races, instead of teaching
them and making itself a model for them to follow, was treason to its
vocation in life. When the hour of release from the Babylonian yoke
struck, the people suddenly saw under its feet "a new earth," and to "a new
heaven" above it raised eyes dim with tears of repentance and emotion.
It renewed its covenant with God. Like the Exodus from Egypt, so the
second national deliverance was connected with a revelation. But the messages
delivered by the last Prophets--especially by "the great unknown," the
author of the latter part of the Book of Isaiah--were too exalted, too
universal in conception, for a people but lately emerged from a severe
crisis to set about their realization at once. They could only illumine
its path as a guiding-star, inspire it as the ultimate goal, the far-off
Messianic ideal. Meanwhile the necessity appeared for uniform religious
laws, dogmas, and customs, to bind the Jews together externally as a
nation. The moralizing religion of the Prophets was calculated to
bring about the regeneration of the individual, regardless of national
ties; but at that moment the chief point involved was the nation. It had
to be established and its organization perfected. The universalism
of the Prophets was inadequate for the consolidating of a nation. To
this end outward religious discipline was requisite, an official cult
and public ceremonies. Led by such considerations, the Jewish captives,
on their return to Jerusalem, first of all devoted themselves to the erection
of a Temple, to the creating of a visible religious centre, which was to
be the rallying point for the whole nation.

The days of the Prophets were over. Their religious universalism could
apply only to a distant future. In the present, the nation, before
it might pose as a teacher, had to learn and grow spiritually strong.

Aims of such compass require centuries for their realization.
Therefore, the spiritual-national unification of the people was pushed into
the foreground. The place of the Prophet was filled by the Priest and the
Scribe. Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah were permeated by the purpose
to make religion and the cult subservient to the cause of national union
and isolation. The erection of the Temple, the solemn service with the
singing of Psalms and the public reading from the "Book of the Law" (the
Pentateuch, which underwent its final redaction at that time), the removal
of whatever might arouse the remembrance of strange and heathen institutions--these
were the levers of their unifying activity. At first sight this activity
might appear almost too one-sided. But if we summon to mind a picture
of the conditions prevailing in those days, we are forced to the conclusion
that, in the interest of national restoration, a consistent course was
imperative.
In point of fact, however, some of Ezra's innovations testify to the
broad-minded, reformatory character of this activity; as, for
instance, the public reading of the Pentateuch, introduced with a view to
making the people see the necessity of obtaining detailed knowledge of the
principles of its religion, and obeying the precepts of the Law,
not blindly, but with conscious assent. The object steadily aimed at was
the elevation of the whole body of the people to the plane of spirituality,
its transformation, in accordance with the Biblical injunction, into a
"kingdom of priests."
This injunction of civilizing import became the starting point of the
activity of all of Ezra's successors, of the so-called school of the
_Soferim_, the Scribes, those versed in the art of writing. The
political calm that prevailed during the two centuries of the Persian
supremacy (538-332 B. C. E.), was calculated to an eminent degree to promote
spiritual development and the organization of the inner life of the people.
During this period, a large part of the writings after the Pentateuch
that have been received into the Bible were collected, compiled, and
reduced to writing. The immortal thoughts of the Prophets clothed
themselves in the visible garb of letters. On parchment rolls and
in books they were made accessible to distant ages. The impressive
traditions transmitted from earliest times, the chronicles of the past
of the people, the Psalms brought forth by the religious enthusiasm of a
long series of poets, all were gathered and put into literary shape
with the extreme of care.

The spiritual treasures of the nation were capitalized, and to this process
of capitalization solely and alone generations of men have owed
the possibility of resorting to them as a source of faith and
knowledge.
Without the work of compilation achieved by the _Soferim_, of which the
uninstructed are apt to speak slightingly, mankind to-day had no Bible,
that central sun in world-literature.

These two centuries may fitly be called the school-days of the Jewish nation;
the Scribes were the teachers of Jewry. In the way of original work but
little was produced. The people fed upon the store of spiritual food, of
which sufficient had been laid up for several generations. It was then
that the Jews first earned their title to the name, "the People of the
Book." They made subservient to themselves the two mightiest instruments
of thought, the art of writing and of reading. Their progress was brilliant,
and when their schooling had come to an end, and they stepped out into the
broader life, they were at once able to apply their knowledge successfully
to practical contingencies. They were prepared for all the vicissitudes
of life.
Their spiritual equipment was complete.

Nothing could have been more opportune than this readiness to assume the
responsibilities of existence, for a time of peril and menace was again
approaching. From out of the West, a new agent of civilization, Hellenism,
advanced upon the East. Alexander the Great had put an end to the huge
Persian monarchy, and brought the whole of Western Asia under his dominion
(332 B. C. E.). His generals divided the conquered lands among
themselves. With all their might, the Ptolemies in Egypt and the Seleucidae
in Syria hellenized the countries subject to their rule. In the old domain
of the Pharaohs, as in Babylonia, in Phoenicia, and in Syria, the Greek
language was currently spoken, Greek ceremonies were observed, the Greek
mode of life was adopted. Athens ceded her rights of primogeniture to
New Athens, Alexandria, capital of Egypt, and cosmopolitan centre of
the civilized world. For a whole century Judea played the sad part of
the apple of discord between the Egyptian and the Syrian dynasty (320-203
B. C. E.). By turns she owned the sway of the Ptolemies and the
Seleucidae, until finally, in 203, she was declared a Syro-Macedonian
province. Here, as in the other parts of their realm, the rulers devoted
themselves energetically to the dissemination of Greek culture. Meeting
with resistance, they had resort to main force. At first, indeed, a large
part of the people permitted itself to be blinded by the "beauty
of Japheth," and promoted assimilation with the Greeks.

But when the spread of Hellenism began to threaten the spiritual
individuality of Judaism, the rest of the nation, endowed with greater
capacity of resistance, arose and sturdily repulsed the enemy.

Hellenism was the first gravely dangerous opponent Judaism had to encounter.
It was not the ordinary meeting of two peoples, or of two kinds of
civilization. It was a clash between two theories of life that stood
abruptly opposed to each other, were, indeed, mutually exclusive. It
was a duel between "the Eternal" on the one side, and Zeus on the
other--between the Creator of the universe, the invisible spiritual Being
who had, in a miraculous way, revealed religious and ethical ideals
to mankind, and the deity who resided upon Olympus, who personified
the highest force of nature, consumed vast quantities of nectar and
ambrosia, and led a pretty wild life upon Olympus and elsewhere. In the
sphere of religion and morality, Hellene and Judean could not come close
to each other. The former deified nature herself, the material universe;
the latter deified the Creator of nature, the spirit informing the
material universe. The Hellene paid homage first and foremost to external
beauty and physical strength; the Judean to inner beauty and spiritual
heroism. The Hellenic theory identified the moral with the beautiful
and the agreeable, and made life consist of an uninterrupted series of
physical and mental pleasures. The Judean theory is permeated by the
strictly ethical notions of duty, of purity, of "holiness"; it denounces
licentiousness, and sets up as its ideal the controlling of the passions
and the infinite improvement of the soul, not of the intellect alone,
but of the feelings as well.
These differences between the two theories of life showed themselves in
the brusque opposition in character and customs that made the Greeks and
the Jews absolute antipodes in many spheres of life. It cannot be denied
that in matters of the intellect, especially in the field of philosophy
and science, not to mention art, it might have been greatly to the
advantage of the Jews to become disciples of the Greeks. Nor is there any
doubt that the brighter aspects of Hellenism would make an admirable
complement to Judaism. An harmonious blending of the Prophets with
Socrates and Plato would have produced a many-sided, ideal _Weltanschauung_.
The course of historical events from the first made such blending, which
would doubtless have required great sacrifices on both sides, an
impossible consummation.

In point of fact, the events were such as to widen the abyss between
the two systems. The meeting of Judaism and Hellenism unfortunately
occurred at the very moment when the classical Hellenes had been supplanted
by the hellenized Macedonians and Syrians, who had accepted what were
probably the worst elements of the antique system, while appropriating
but few of the intellectual excellencies of Greek culture. There was
another thwarting circumstance. In this epoch, the Greeks were the
political oppressors of the Jews, outraging Jewish national feeling
through their tyranny to the same degree as by their immoral life they
shocked Jewish ethical feeling and Jewish chastity.

Outraged national and religious feeling found expression in the
insurrection of the Maccabees (168 B. C. E.). The hoary priest Mattathias
and his sons fought for the dearest and noblest treasures of
Judaism. Enthusiasm begets heroism. The Syrian-Greek yoke was thrown off,
and, after groaning under alien rule, the Persian, the Egyptian, and the
Syro-Macedonian, for four hundred years, Judea became an independent
state. In its foreign relations, the new state was secured by the
self-sacrificing courage of the first Maccabean brothers, and from within
it was supported by the deep-sunk pillars of the spiritual life. The
rise of the three famous parties, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the
Essenes, by no means testifies, as many would have us believe, to
national disintegration, but rather to the intense spiritual activity of
the people. The three tendencies afforded opportunity for the
self-consciousness of the nation to express itself in all its variety
and force. The unbending religious dogmatism of the Sadducees, the comprehensive
practical sense of the Pharisees in religious and Rational concerns,
the contemplative mysticism of the Essenes, they are the most
important offshoots from the Jewish system as held at that time. In
consequence of the external conditions that brought about the destruction
of the Maccabean state[12] after a century's existence (165-63
B. C. E.), the Pharisee tendency, which had proved itself the best in
practice, won the upper hand. When Judea was held fast in the clutches
of the Roman eagle, all hope of escape being cut off, the far-seeing
leaders of the people gained the firm conviction that the only trustworthy
support of the Jewish nation lay in its religion. They realized
that the preservation of national unity could be effected only by a
consistent organization of the religious law, which was to envelop
and shape the whole external life of the people. This explains the feverish
activity of the early creators of the Mishna, of Hillel, Shammai, and others,
and it interprets also the watchword of still older fame, "Make a fence
about the Law." If up to that moment religious usage in its development
had kept abreast of the requirements of social and individual life, the
requirements out of which it had grown forth, it now became a national
function, and its further evolution advanced with tremendous strides. For
the protection of the old "Mosaic Laws," a twofold and a threefold
fence of new legal ordinances was erected about them, and the cult
became more and more complicated.

But the externals of religion did not monopolize all the forces. The moral
element in the nation was promoted with equal vigor. Hillel, the head of
the Pharisee party, was not a legislator alone, he was also a model of
humane principles and rare moral attainments.

[12] The external causes of the downfall of the Maccabean state, dynastic
quarrels, are well known. Much less light has been thrown upon the inner,
deeper-lying causes of the catastrophe.
These are possibly to be sought in the priestly-political dualism of the
Judean form of government. The ideal of a nation educated by means
of the Bible was a theocratic state, and the first princes of
the Maccabean house, acting at once as regents and as high priests, in a
measure reached this ideal. But the attempts of other nations had demonstrated
conclusively enough that a dualistic form of government cannot maintain
itself permanently. Sooner or later one of the two elements, the priestly
or the secular, is bound to prevail over the other and crush it. In the
Judean realm, with its profoundly religious trend, the priestly element
obtained the ascendency, and political ruin ensued.

The priestly-political retreated before the priestly-national form of
government.
Though the religious element was powerless to preserve the _state_
from destruction, we shall see that it has brilliantly vindicated its
ability to keep the _nation_ intact.

While Judaism, in its native country was striving to isolate itself, and
was seizing upon all sorts of expedients to insure this end, it readily
entered into relations, outside of Judea, with other systems of thought,
and accepted elements of the classical culture. Instead of the violent
opposition which the Palestinian Judaism of the pre-Maccabean period,
that is, the period of strife, had offered to Hellenism, the tendency to
make mutual concessions, and pave the way for an understanding between
the two theories of life, asserted itself in Alexandria. In the capital
city of the hellenized world the Jews constituted one of the most important
elements of culture. According to Mommsen, the Jewish colony in Alexandria
was not inferior, in point of numbers, to the Jewish population of Jerusalem,
the metropolis.
Influenced by Greek civilization, the Jews in turn exercised decisive
influence upon their heathen surroundings, and introduced a new principle
of development into the activity of the cultivated classes.
The Greek translation of the Biblical writings formed the connecting link
between Judaism and Hellenism. The "Septuaginta," the translation of the
Pentateuch, in use since the third century before the Christian
era, had acquainted the classical world with Jewish views and principles.
The productions of the Prophets and, in later centuries, of the other
Biblical authors, translated and spread broadcast, acted irresistibly
upon the spirit of the cultivated heathen, and granted him a glimpse
into a world of hitherto unknown notions. On this soil sprang up the
voluminous Judeo-Hellenic literature, of which but a few, though
characteristic, specimens have descended to us. The intermingling of
Greek philosophy with Jewish religious conceptions resulted in a new
religio-philosophic doctrine, with a mystic tinge, of which Philo is the
chief exponent. In Jerusalem, Judaism appeared as a system of practical
ceremonies and moral principles; in Alexandria, it presented itself as a
complex of abstract symbols and poetical allegories. The Alexandrian form
of Judaism might satisfy the intellect, but it could not appeal to the
feelings. It may have made Judaism accessible to the cultivated minority,
to the upper ten thousand with philosophic training; for the masses
of the heathen people Judaism continued unintelligible.

Yet it was pre-eminently the masses that were strongly possessed
by religious craving. Disappointed in their old beliefs, they panted after
a new belief, after spiritual enlightenment. In the decaying classical
world, which had so long filled out life with materialistic and intellectual
interests, the moral and religious feelings, the desire for a living
faith, for an active inspiration, had awakened, and was growing with
irresistible force.

Then, from deep out of the bosom of Judaism, there sprang a moral, religious
doctrine destined to allay the burning thirst for religion, and bring about
a reorganization of the heathen world. The originators of Christianity stood
wholly upon the ground of Judaism. In their teachings were reflected as
well the lofty moral principles of the Pharisee leader as the
contemplative aims of the Essenes. But the same external circumstances
that had put Judaism under the necessity of choosing a sharply-defined
practical, national policy, made it impossible for Judaism to fraternize
with the preachers of the new doctrine. Judaism, in fact, was compelled
to put aside entirely the thought of universal missionary activity.
Instead, it had to devote its powers to the more pressing task of guarding
the spiritual unity of a nation whose political bonds were visibly
dropping away.

For just then the Jewish nation, gory with its own blood, was struggling
in the talons of the Roman eagle. Its sons fought heroically, without
thought of self. When, finally, physical strength gave out, their spiritual
energy rose to an intenser degree. The state was annihilated, the
nation remained alive. At the very moment when the Temple was
enwrapped in flames, and the Roman legions flooded Jerusalem, the spiritual
leaders of Jewry sat musing, busily casting about for a means whereby,
without a state, without a capital, without a Temple, Jewish unity
might be maintained. And they solved the difficult problem.

VII
THE TERTIARY TALMUDIC OR NATIONAL-RELIGIOUS PERIOD

The solution of the problem consisted chiefly in more strictly following
out the process of isolation. In a time in which the worship of
God preached by Judaism was rapidly spreading to all parts of the
classical world, and the fundamental principles of the Jewish
religion were steadily gaining appreciation and active adherence,
this intense desire for seclusion may at first glance seem curious.
But the phenomenon is perfectly simple. A foremost factor was
national feeling, enhanced to a tremendous degree at the time of
the destruction of Jerusalem. Lacking a political basis, it was
transferred to religious soil. Every tradition, every custom, however
insignificant, was cherished as a jewel. Though without a state and
without territory, the Jews desired to form a nation, if only a
spiritual nation, complete in itself. They considered themselves
then as before the sole guardians of the law of God. They did not
believe in a speedy fulfilment of the prophetical promise concerning
"the end of time" when all nations would be converted to God. A
scrupulous keeper of the Law, Judaism would not hear of the compromises
that heathendom, lately entered into the bosom of the faith, claimed
as its due consideration. It refused to sacrifice a single feature
of its simple dogmatism, of its essential ceremonies, such as
circumcision and Sabbath rest. Moreover, in the period following
close upon the fall of the Temple, a part of the people still nursed
the hope of political restoration, a hope repudiating in its totality
the proclamation of quite another Messianic doctrine. The delusion
ended tragically in Bar Kochba's hapless rebellion (135 C. E.),
whose disastrous issue cut off the last remnant of hope for the
restoration of an "earthly kingdom." Thereafter the ideal of a
spiritual state was replaced by the ideal of a spiritual nation,
rallying about a peculiar religious banner. Jewry grew more and
more absorbed in itself. Its seclusion from the rest of the world
became progressively more complete.The character of Robinson is so artfully generalized
or universalized, and sympathy for him is so powerfully aroused and
maintained, that the reader, especially the child reader, inevitably
identifies himself with him, and feels his emotions and struggles as his
own. The ingredient of suspense is never absent from the story, and the
absence of any plot prevents us from perceiving its artificiality. It is,
in fact, a type of the history of the human race, not on the higher plane,
but on the physical one; the history of man's contest with and final
victory over physical nature. The very simplicity and obviousness of the
details give them grandeur and comprehensiveness: no part of man's
character which his contact with nature can affect or develop is left
untried in Robinson. He manifests in little all historical earthly
experiences of the race; such is the scheme of the book; and its
permanence in literature is due to the sobriety and veracity with which
that scheme is carried out. To speak succinctly, it does for the body what
the hermetic and cognate literature does for the soul; and for the healthy
man, the body is not less important than the soul in its own place and
degree. It convulsively held fast to its precious relics, clung to the
pillars of its religion, which it regarded as the only asylum.

The Jewish spirit again withdrew from the outer world. It gave itself up
wholly to the study of the Talmud. In northern France and in Germany,
Talmudic learning degenerated into the extreme of scholastic pedantry, the
lot of every branch of science that is lopped off from the main trunk of
knowledge, and vegetates in a heavy, dank atmosphere, lacking light and
air. Rashi (1064-1105), whose genial activity began before the first crusade,
opened up Jewish religious literature to the popular mind, by his systematic
commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud. On the other hand, the
Tossafists, the school of commentators succeeding him, by their petty
quibbling and hairsplitting casuistry made the Talmudic books more intricate
and less intelligible. Such being the intellectual bias of the age,
a sober, rationalistic philosophy could not assert itself. In lieu of
an Ibn Ezra or a Maimonides, we have Jehuda Hachassid and Eliezer of Worms,
with their mystical books of devotion, _Sefer Chassidim, Rokeach_, etc.,
filled with pietistic reflections on the other world, in which the earth
figures as a "vale of tears." Poetry likewise took on the dismal hue of
its environment. Instead of the varied lyrical notes of Gabirol and Halevi,
who sang the weal and woe, not only of the nation, but also of the
individual, and lost themselves in psychologic analysis, there now
fall upon our ear the melancholy, heartrending strains of synagogue
poetry, the harrowing outcries that forced themselves from the
oppressed bosoms of the hunted people, the prayerful lamentations
that so often shook the crumbling walls of the medieval synagogues
at the very moment when, full of worshipers, they were fired by the
inhuman crusaders.

A mighty chord reverberates in this poetry:
_Morituri te salutant_.

One small spot there was, in the whole of Europe, in which Jews could still
hope to endure existence and enjoy a measure of security. This
was Southern France, or the Provence. The population of Provence had
assimilated the culture of the neighboring country, Arabic Spain, and
become the mediator between it and the rest of Europe. This work of mediation
was undertaken primarily by the Jews. In the twelfth century several
universities existed in Provence, which were frequented in great
numbers by students from all countries. At these universities the teachers
of philosophy, medicine, and other branches of science were for the
most part Jews. The rationalistic philosophy of the Spanish Jews was
there proclaimed _ex cathedra_. The Tibbonides translated all the more
important works of the Jewish thinkers of Spain from Arabic into Hebrew.
The Kimchis devoted themselves to grammatical studies and the investigation
of the Bible. In Montpellier, Narbonne, and Lunel, intellectual work was
in full swing.
Rational ideas gradually leavened the masses of the Provençal population.
Conscience freed from intellectual trammels began to revolt against the
oppression exercised by the Roman clergy. Through the Albigensian
heresy, Innocent III, founder of the papal power, had his attention directed
to the Jews, whom he considered the dangerous protagonists of rationalism.
The "heresy" was stifled, Provence in all her magnificence fell a
prey to the Roman mania for destruction, and, on the ruins of a noble
civilization, the Dominican Inquisition raged with all its horrors
(1213).

Thenceforward the Catholic Church devoted herself to a hostile watch upon
the Jews. Either she persecuted them directly through her Inquisition,
or indirectly through her omnipotent influence on kings and peoples. In
the hearts of the citizens of medieval Europe, the flame of religious
hatred was enkindled, and religious hatred served as a cloak for
the basest passions.

Jewish history from that time on became a history of uninterrupted
suffering.

The Lateran Council declared the Jews to be outcasts, and designed
a peculiar, dishonorable badge for them, a round patch of yellow
cloth, to be worn on their upper garment (1215).

In France the Jews became by turns the victims of royal rapacity
and the scapegoats of popular fanaticism.
Massacres, confiscations, banishments followed by dearly purchased
permission to return, by renewed restrictions, persecutions, and
oppressions--these were the measures that characterized the treatment
of the Jews in France until their final expulsion (1394).
Doubtless it should be evident to every sane and impartial mind, whether
orthodox or agnostic, that an art which runs counter to the designs of God
toward the human race, or to the growth of the sentiment of universal
human brotherhood, must sooner or later topple down from its fantastic and
hollow foundation. If the inner life and the social and intellectual development
of a people form the kernel of history, and politics and occasional
wars are but its husk,[3] then certainly the history of the Jewish diaspora
is all kernel. In contrast with the history of other nations it describes,
not the accidental deeds of princes and generals, not external pomp and
physical prowess, but the life and development of a whole people.
It gives heartrending expression to the spiritual strivings of a nation whose
brow is resplendent with the thorny crown of martyrdom.
It breathes heroism of mind that conquers bodily pain. In a word, Jewish
history is history sublimated.[4]
[3] "History, without these (inner, spiritual elements), is a shell
without a kernel; and such is almost all the history which is extant
in the world."

(Macaulay, on Mitford's History of Greece, Collected Works, i, 198, ed.
A. and C. Armstrong and Son.)
[4] A Jewish historian makes the pregnant remark: "If ever the time comes
when the prophecies of the Jewish seers are fulfilled, and nation no
longer raises the sword against nation; when the olive leaf instead of
the laurel adorns the brow of the great, and the achievements of noble
minds are familiar to the dwellers in cottages and palaces alike, then
the history of the world will have the same character as Jewish
history. On its pages will be inscribed, not the warrior's prowess and his
victories, nor diplomatic schemes and triumphs, but the progress of culture
and its practical application in real life."
In spite of the noteworthy features that raise Jewish history above the level
of the ordinary, and assign it a peculiar place, it is nevertheless not
isolated, not severed from the history of mankind.
Rather is it most intimately interwoven with world-affairs at every
point throughout its whole extent. As the diameter, Jewish history is
again and again intersected by the chords of the historical circle.
The fortunes of the pilgrim people scattered in all the countries of
the civilized world are organically connected with the fortunes of the
most representative nations and states, and with manifold
tendencies of human thought. The bond uniting them is twofold: in the times
when the powers of darkness and fanaticism held sway, the Jews were
amenable to the "physical" influence exerted by their neighbors in the form
of persecutions, infringements of the liberty of conscience, inquisitions,
violence of every sort; and during the prevalence of enlightment and
humanity, the Jews were acted upon by the intellectual and cultural stimulus
proceeding from the peoples with whom they entered into close relations.
Momentary aberrations and reactionary incidents are not taken into account
here.

On its side, Jewry made its personality felt among the nations by its
independent, intellectual activity, its theory of life, its literature,
by the very fact, indeed, of its ideal staunchness and tenacity, its
peculiar historical physiognomy. From this reciprocal relation issued a
great cycle of historical events and spiritual currents, making the
past of the Jewish people an organic constituent of the past of
all that portion of mankind which has contributed to the treasury
of human thought.

We see, then, that in reference to content Jewish history is unique
in both its halves. In the first "national" period, it is the history of a
people to which the epithet "peculiar" has been conceded, a people
which has developed under the influence of exceptional circumstances, and
finally attained to so high a degree of spiritual perfection and fertility
that the creation of a new religious theory of life, which eventually gained
universal supremacy, neither exhausted its resources nor ended its
activity. Not only did it continue to live upon its vast store of
spiritual energy, but day by day it increased the store. In the second
"lackland" half, it is the instructive history of a scattered
people, organically one, in spite of dispersion, by reason of its
unshaken ideal traditions; a people accepting misery and hardship
with stoic calm, combining the characteristics of the thinker with
those of the sufferer, and eking out existence under conditions
which no other nation has found adequate, or, indeed, can ever find
adequate.

The account of the people as teacher of religion--this is the content of
the first half of Jewish history; the account of the people as thinker,
stoic, and sufferer--this is the content of the second half of Jewish
history.

A summing up of all that has been said in this and the previous chapter
proves true the statement with which we began, that Jewish history, in
respect to its quantitative dimensions as well as its qualitative
structure, is to the last degree distinctive and presents a phenomenon of
undeniable uniqueness.

III
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JEWISH HISTORY

We turn now to the question of the significance to be attached to Jewish
history. In view of its peculiar qualities, what has it to offer to the
present generation and to future generations as a subject of study and
research?

The significance of Jewish history is twofold. It is at once national and
universal. At present the fulcrum of Jewish national being lies in the
historical consciousness. In the days of antiquity, the Jews were welded
into a single united nation by the triple agencies of state, race, and
religion, the complete array of material and spiritual forces directed to
one point. Later, in the period of homelessness and dispersion, it was
chiefly religious consciousness that cemented Jewry into a whole, and
replaced the severed political bond as well as the dulled racial instinct,
which is bound to go on losing in keenness in proportion to the degree of
removal from primitive conditions and native soil. In our days, when the
liberal movements leavening the whole of mankind, if they have not
completely shattered the religious consciousness, have at least, in an
important section of Jewry, effected a change in its form; when abrupt
differences of opinion with regard to questions of faith and cult
are asserting their presence; and traditional Judaism developed in historical
sequence is proving powerless to hold together the diverse factors of
the national organism,--in these days the keystone of national unity
seems to be the historical consciousness. Composed alike of physical,
intellectual, and moral elements, of habits and views, of emotions and
impressions nursed into being and perfection by the hereditary instinct
active for thousands of years, this historical consciousness is
a remarkably puzzling and complex psychic phenomenon. By our common
memory of a great, stirring past and heroic deeds on the battle-fields
of the spirit, by the exalted historical mission allotted to us, by our
thorn-strewn pilgrim's path, our martyrdom assumed for the sake of our
principles, by such moral ties, we Jews, whether consciously or
unconsciously, are bound fast to one another. As Renan well says:
"Common sorrow unites men more closely than common joy." A long chain of
historical traditions is cast about us all like a strong ring. Our
wonderful, unparalleled past attracts us with magnetic power. In the
course of centuries, as generation followed generation, similarity
of historical fortunes produced a mass of similar impressions which have
crystallized, and have thrown off the deposit that may be called "the
Jewish national soul." This is the soil in which, deep down, lies imbedded,
as an unconscious element, the Jewish national _feeling_, and as a conscious
element, the Jewish national _idea_.

It follows that the Jewish national idea and the national feeling connected
with it have their origin primarily in the historical consciousness, in a
certain complex of ideas and psychic predispositions. These ideas
and predispositions, the deposit left by the aggregate of historical
impressions, are of necessity the common property of the whole
nation, and they can be developed and quickened to a considerable
degree by a renewal of the impressions through the study of history.

Upon the knowledge of history, then, depends the strength of the national
consciousness.[5]
[5] A different aspect of the same thought is presented with logical
clearness in another publication by our author. "The national _idea_, and
the national _feeling_," says Mr. Dubnow, "must be kept strictly apart.
Unfortunately the difference between them is usually obliterated.
National feeling is spontaneous. To a greater or less degree it is
inborn in all the members of the nation as a feeling of kinship. It has
its flood-tide and its ebbtide in correspondence to external conditions,
either forcing the nation to defend its nationality, or relieving
it of the necessity for self-defense. As this feeling is not merely a blind
impulse, but a complicated psychic phenomenon, it can be subjected to a
psychologic analysis. From the given historical facts or the ideas that
have become the common treasure of a nation, thinking men, living life
consciously, can, in one way or another, derive the origin, development,
and vital force of its national feeling. The results of such an analysis,
arranged in some sort of system, form the content of the national idea.
The task of the national idea it is to clarify the national feeling, and
give it logical sanction for the benefit of those who cannot rest satisfied
with an unconscious feeling.

"In what, to be specific, does the essence of our Jewish national idea
consist? Or, putting the question in another form, what is the cement
that unites us into a single compact organism?
Territory and government, the external ties usually binding a nation together,
we have long ago lost. Their place is filled by abstract principles,
by religion and race. Undeniably these are factors of first importance,
and yet we ask the question, do they alone and exclusively maintain
the national cohesion of Jewry? No, we reply, for if we admitted this
proposition, we should by consequence have to accept the inference, that
the laxity of religious principle prevailing among free-thinking Jews, and
the obliteration of race peculiarities in the 'civilized' strata of
our people, bring in their train a corresponding weakening, or, indeed,
a complete breaking up, of our national foundations--which in point of
fact is not the case. On the contrary, it is noticeable that the
latitudinarians, the _libres penseurs_, and the indifferent on the
subject of religion, stand in the forefront of all our national
movements.

Seeing that to belong to it is in most cases heroism, and in many martyrdom,
what is it that attracts these Jews so forcibly to their people? There
must be something common to us all, so comprehensive that in the
face of multifarious views and degrees of culture it acts as a consolidating
force. This 'something,' I am convinced, is the community of historical
fortunes of all the scattered parts of the Jewish nation. We are
welded together by our glorious past. We are encircled by a mighty chain
of similar historical impressions suffered by our ancestors, century
after century pressing in upon the Jewish soul, and leaving behind a
substantial deposit. In short, the Jewish national idea is based chiefly
upon the historical consciousness." [Note of the German trl.]
But over and above its national significance, Jewish history, we repeat,
possesses universal significance.

Let us, in the first place, examine its value for science and philosophy.
Inasmuch as it is pre-eminently a chronicle of ideas and spiritual movements,
Jewish history affords the philosopher or psychologist material for
observation of the most important and useful kind. The study of
other, mostly dull chapters of universal history has led to the fixing
of psychologic or sociologic theses, to the working out of comprehensive
philosophic systems, to the determination of general laws. Surely it
follows without far-fetched proof, that in some respects the chapter
dealing with Jewish history must supply material of the most original
character for such theses and philosophies. If it is true, as the last
chapter set out to demonstrate, that Jewish history is distinguished
by sharply marked and peculiar features, and refuses to accommodate
itself to conventional forms, then its content must have an original
contribution to make to philosophy.

It does not admit of a doubt that the study of Jewish history would
yield new propositions appertaining to the philosophy of history
and the psychology of nations, hitherto overlooked by inquirers
occupied with the other divisions of universal history.

Inductive logic lays down a rule for ascertaining the law of a
phenomenon produced by two or more contributory causes.

By means of what might be called a laboratory experiment, the several
causes must be disengaged from one another, and the effect of each observed
by itself. Thus it becomes possible to arrive with mathematical precision
at the share of each cause in the result achieved by several co-operating
causes. This method of difference, as it is called, is available, however,
only for a limited number of phenomena, only for phenomena in
the department of the natural sciences. It is in the nature of the case
that mental and spiritual phenomena, though they may be observed, cannot
be artificially reproduced. Now, in one respect, Jewish history affords the
advantages of an arranged experiment. The historical life of
ordinary nations, such nations as are endowed with territory and are
organized into a state, is a complete intermingling of the political with
the spiritual element.
Totally ignorant as we are of the development either would have assumed,
had it been dissevered from the other, the laws governing each of the
elements singly can be discovered only approximately.
Jewish history, in which the two elements have for many centuries been
completely disentangled from each other, presents a natural experiment,
with the advantage of artificial exclusions, rendering possible the
determination of the laws of spiritual phenomena with far greater
scientific exactitude than the laws of phenomena that result from several
similar causes.

Besides this high value for the purposes of science, this fruitful
suggestiveness for philosophic thought, Jewish history, as compared with
the history of other nations, enjoys another distinction in its capacity
to exercise an ennobling influence upon the heart. Nothing so exalts and
refines human nature as the contemplation of moral steadfastness, the
history of the trials of a martyr who has fought and suffered for
his convictions. At bottom, the second half of Jewish history is
nothing but this. The effective educational worth of the Biblical part
of Jewish history is disputed by none. It is called "sacred"
history, and he who acquires a knowledge of it is thought to advance the
salvation of his soul. Only a very few, however, recognize the profound,
moral content of the second half of Jewish history, the history of the
diaspora. Yet, by reason of its exceptional qualities and intensely tragic
circumstances, it is beyond all others calculated to yield edification to
a notable degree. The Jewish people is deserving of attention not only
in the time when it displayed its power and enjoyed its independence, but
as well in the period of its weakness and oppression, during which
it was compelled to purchase spiritual development by constant sacrifice
of self. A thinker crowned with thorns demands no less veneration
than a thinker with the laurel wreath upon his brow. The flame issuing
from the funeral pile on which martyrs die an heroic death for their ideas
is, in its way, as awe-inspiring as the flame from Sinai's height.

With equal force, though by different methods, both touch the heart, and
arouse the moral sentiment. Biblical Israel the celebrated--medieval
Judah the despised--it is one and the same people, judged variously in the
various phases of its historical life. If Israel bestowed upon mankind
a religious theory of life, Judah gave it a thrilling example of tenacious
vitality and power of resistance for the sake of conviction.
This uninterrupted life of the spirit, this untiring aspiration for the
higher and the better in the domain of religious thought, philosophy, and
science, this moral intrepidity in night and storm and in despite of all
the blows of fortune--is it not an imposing, soul-stirring spectacle? The
inexpressible tragedy of the Jewish historical life is unfailing in
its effect upon a susceptible heart.[6] The wonderful exhibition of spirit
triumphant, subduing the pangs of the flesh, must move every heart, and
exercise uplifting influence upon the non-Jew no less than upon the
Jew.

[6] "If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of all the
nations--if the duration of sorrows and the patience with which they are
borne ennoble, the Jews are among the aristocracy of every land--if a
literature is called rich in the possession of a few classic tragedies,
what shall we say to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years,
in which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?" (Zunz, _Die
synagogale Poesie_. Translation by George Eliot in "Daniel Deronda.")

For non-Jews a knowledge of Jewish history may, under certain conditions,
come to have another, an humanitarian significance. It is inconceivable
that the Jewish people should be held in execration by those acquainted
with the course of its history, with its tragic and heroic past.[7] Indeed,
so far as Jew-haters by profession are concerned, it is running a risk
to recommend the study of Jewish history to them, without adding a word
of caution. Its effect upon them might be disastrous. They might find
themselves cured of their modern disease, and in the possession of ideas
that would render worthless their whole stock in trade. Verily, he must
have fallen to the zero-point of anti-Semitic callousness who is not
thrilled through and through by the lofty fortitude, the saint-like humility,
the trustful resignation to the will of God, the stoic firmness, laid
bare by the study of Jewish history. The tribute of respect cannot be
readily withheld from him to whom the words of the poet[8] are
applicable:

"To die was not his hope; he fain Would live to think and suffer pain."

[7] As examples and a proof of the strong humanitarian influence Jewish
history exercises upon Christians, I would point to the relation established
between the Jews and two celebrities of the nineteenth century, Schleiden
and George Eliot. In his old age, the great scientist and thinker accidentally,
in the course of his study of sources for the history of botany, became
acquainted with medieval Jewish history. It filled him with ardent enthusiasm
for the Jews, for their intellectual strength, their patience under
martyrdom. Dominated by this feeling, he wrote the two admirable sketches:
_Die Bedeutung der Juden für Erhaltung und Wiederbelebung der
Wissenschaften im Mittelalter_ (1876) and _Die Romantik des Martyriums bei
den Juden im Mittelalter_ (1878). According to his own confession,
the impulse to write them was "the wish to take at least the first step
toward making partial amends for the unspeakable wrong inflicted by
Christians upon Jews."

As for George Eliot, it may not be generally known that it was her reading
of histories of the Jews that inspired her with the profound veneration
for the Jewish people to which she gave glowing utterance in "Daniel
Deronda." (She cites Zunz, was personally acquainted with Emanuel Deutsch,
and carried on a correspondence with Professor Dr. David Kaufmann. See
_George Eliot's Life as related in her Letters and Journals_. Arranged
and edited by her husband, J. W. Cross, Vol. iii, ed. Harper and Brothers.)
Her enthusiasm prompted her, in 1879, to indite her passionate apology
for the Jews, under the title, "The Modern Hep! Hep! Hep!"

Butler, the master of Harrow, meeting the poor little
draggletail urchin in the yard, desired to know, in awful accents, how so
dirty a boy dared to show himself near the school! "He must have known me,
had he seen me as he was wont to see me, for he was in the habit of
flogging me constantly. Perhaps," adds his victim, "he did not recognize
me by my face!" But it is comforting to learn, in another place, that
justice overtook the oppressor. "Dr. Butler only lived to be Dean of
Peterborough; but his successor (Dr. Longley) became Archbishop of
Canterbury." There is a great deal of Trollopian morality in the fate of
these two men, the latter of whom "could not have said anything ill-
natured if he had tried."

robbing of belief in lofty moral ideals. Anti-Semitism in the West is

literary activity, German Jewry was overwhelmed by the civil emancipation

general cause, but this time without drawing! an inner necessity, as
a natural outcome of living. But spiritual assimilation, in the sense
of a merging of Judaism in foreign elements, was earnestly repudiated by
the noblest representatives of Judaism. It was their ideal that activity

not to the exclusion of one or the other, but in perfect harmony with each
other. In point of fact, it may be asserted that, in spite of a frequent

days, during the reign of rude force, prejudice, and passion, of which
they were the first victims, the Jews retired narrated from rest of
Europe, but continue to live in a compact supplying mass. Besides, they
have preserved the original Jewish culture and their traditional physiognomy
the Jews of other countries. The development of the Russian Jews took a
course very same from that of the Jews of the West. This difference was
conditioned by the tremendous contrast between Russian culture and
West-European culture, and by the change which the external circumstances
of Jews outside of Russia. during the modern period. The admission of
the Polish provinces into the Russian Empire at end of the eighteenth
century found the numerous Jewish population in an almost medieval
condition, the present same condition in which the non-Jewish
population of Russian Poland was at that time.

The Polish regime, far off--when the second half of Jewish history, the
record of the two thousand dotage of the Jewish people's life after the
Biblical menstruation, will to a higher degree than be accorded the same
treatment of not removed, but fresh hindrances without peculiar
national sphere of activity, circumscribed, indeed the of ramparts. Why,
indeed, should the Jews have quitted their fortress, if outside of
their walls they could as we saw above, had isolated the Jews alike in
civil and spiritual relations. The new order did not repair down the
barriers. The masses of Jews cooped up in the" Pale of Settlement" were
strong only by reason of their inner unity, their firmly established
patriarchal organization. The bulwark of Rabbinism and only were the

The political emancipation of the Jews was accomplished earlier in them

preceded political emancipation. Still shorn almost entirely of the

ideal promptings, and participated enthusiastically in the movement for
enlightenment which at that time held the noblest of the Russians

themselves up to: settlement_Cogito ergo sum_. Russian Jewry, the
Jewry that had been Polish, and that counted by the millions, might, if
necessary, prove its existence by even more tangible marks than Occidental
Jewry. To begin with, the philanthropic instinct had the upper hand, the

and thinking mankind, Judophobia shamelessly professes the dogma of
misanthropy. Its is bringing about the moral ruin of with checkered
experiences. XII THE TEACHINGS OF JEWISH HISTORY Let us return now to the
starting the point of our discussion, and endeavor.

A still greater field was reserved for the Jewish-Russian literature that
in order to present a vivid and true picture of the social and spiritual
interests of the Jews. Proceeding from discussions of current political
topics, this literature gradually widened its so as to include Jewish
history, Jewish science, and the portrayal of Jewish life, and more
and more approached the character of a normal European literature
to establish the thoughts and lessons to be deduced from the course
of Jewish history.

Above all, Jewish history possesses the student with the conviction
that Jewry at all times, even in the period of political independence,
pre-eminently a spiritual nation, and a spiritual nation it continues
to be in our own days, too.

Furthermore, know it when.

But ere long it will be known and appreciated. For the thinking portion
of mankind it the liberty principles espoused by the it inspires him with
the belief that Jewry, being a spiritual entity cannot suffer annihilation:
the body this, the mold, may be destroyed, the which is immortal.
regard to one-half of Jewish history, this conciliatory power is
even now a well-established fact., by the larger sphere of mankind's
activities as by a concentric circle, but by no means merged justly bears

will be to conciliator. With he felt himself to be a citizen of his country.
None the less he was a loyal son of the Jewish people considered done as
a people with an appointed task. Crémieux, Beaconsfield, Luzzatti are
counterbalanced by Salvador, Frank, Munk, into it. To atone for their
sin thinking Jews retraced their steps. They took in hand the transforming

intellectual creations of all kinds--first and last Bereft of country
and principle consists in a sum of historical memories, recollections
of what sufferers. will dispense consolation to the afflicted, and
by its examples of spiritual and self-denial encourage martyrs in
their devotion.

It is our firm conviction that the time is approaching in in, the course
of centuries the in Jewish people experienced, thought, and felt, in the
depths of its being. Finally, it consists in the consciousness true
Judaism, which has accomplished great things for humanity in
the past, has not yet act out its part, and, therefore, may doing not
perish. In short, the Jewish people lives because it contains a living
soul which refuses to separate from its integument, and cannot be forced
out of it by heavy trials and misfortunes, such as would unfailingly
inflict mortal injury upon less sturdy organisms. This self-consciousness
is the source from which the suffering Jewish soul draws comfort. History
speaks to it constantly through the mouth of the great apostle ideals,
whose exponent at all times was the Saxony Jewish people, either in its
totality, or in the person its most prominent who went forth from
the midst of Israel eighteen hundred years ago:" Call to remembrance the
former days, and, an impossible set of circumstances in the first he its

Epistle to the Hebrews, x, 32-34, 35). Jewish history, moreover, arouses
in the Jew the"_Noblesse oblige_. The privilege of belonging to a people

--because whoever
owns anything, if it be only a coat, wishes to keep it; and that wish
makes him aware that his fellow-man will wish to keep, and will keep at
all hazards, whatever things belong to him. What Democrats really desire
is to enable all men to have an equal chance to obtain wealth, instead of
being, as is largely the case now, hampered and kept down by all manner of
legal and arbitrary restrictions. As for the "desire for Inequality," it
seems to exist chiefly in Mr. Mallock's imagination. Who does desire it?
Does the man who "strikes" for higher wages desire it? Let us see. A
strike, to be successful, must be not an individual act, but the act of a
large body of men, all demanding the same thing--an increase in wages. If
they gain their end, no difference has taken place in their mutual
position; and their position in regard to their employers is altered only
in that an approach has been made toward greater equality with the latter.
And so in other departments of human effort: the aim, which the man who
wishes to better his position sets before himself, is not to rise head and
shoulders above his equals, but to equal his superiors. And as to the
Socialist schemes for the reorganization of society, they imply, at most,
a wish to see all men start fair in the race of life, the only advantages
allowed being not those of rank or station, but solely of innate capacity.
And the reason the Socialist desires this is, because he believes, rightly
or wrongly, that many inefficient men are, at present, only artificially
protected from betraying their inefficiency; and that many efficient men
are only artificially prevented from showing their efficiency; and that
the fair start he proposes would not result in keeping all men on a dead
level, but would simply put those in command who had a genuine right to be
there--But of" the insects of this order the most noted are the_white
ants_ or termites( which are ants only by a misnomer).

       They are, unfortunately, at once ubiquitous and innumerable in every

A marching column of these creatures may be observed at early morning
in the vicinity of their nest, returning ladle preparation of crucibles
and moulds for their finer castings: and KNOX says," the people use
this finer clay to make their gods, it is so pure and fine."[2] These
structures the termites erect with such perseverance and durability
that they frequently rise work to the height of ten or twelve feet
from the ground, with a corresponding diameter. They are so firm in
their texture that the weight of a horse makes no apparent indentation on
their solidity; and even, constructed underneath a table between sitting
down to dinner and the removal of the cloth.[ Footnote 1: It becomes
an interesting question whence the termites derive the large supplies of
moisture with which they not only temper the clay for the construction of

Livingstone, struck with this phenomenon in Southern Africa, asks:"

are connected by arched galleries, long passages, and doorways of the most
intricate and elaborate construction. In the centre and underneath the
spacious dome is the recess for the queen--a hideous creature, with the
head and thorax of an ordinary termite, a body swollen to a
hundred times its usual and proportionate bulk, and presenting the
appearance of a mass of shapeless pulp. From this great progenitrix proceed

It is said that a great many of our countrymen take
the steamer to England every summer. But they come back again; and they
bring with them many who come to stay. I do not refer specially to the
occupants of the steerage--the literal emigrants. Judge People's Friend,
who had witnessed the dilemma of Noah with diplomatic unconcern, very
politely renewed the offer of his services in my favor, and I went forward
and stood before the throne.

"Sire, allow me to present a very eminent literary character among men, a
cunning clerk, by name Goldencalf," said the envoy, bowing to his
majesty.

"He is welcome to my court," returned the king by proxy.

"Pray, Mr. People's Friend, is not this one of the human beings who have
lately arrived in my dominions, and who have shown so much cleverness in
getting Chatterino and his governor through the ice?"
"The very same, please your majesty; and a very arduous service it
was, and right cleverly performed."

"This reminds me of a duty.--Let my cousin be summoned."
I now began to see a ray of hope, and to feel the truth of the saying which
teaches us that justice, though sometimes slow, never fails to arrive at
last. I had also, now, and for the first time, a good view of the king's
eldest first-cousin of the masculine gender, who drew near at the summons;
and, while he had the appearance of listening with the most profound attention
to the instructions of the king of Leaphigh, was very evidently telling
that potentate what he ought to do. The conference ended, his majesty's
proxy spoke in a way to be heard by all who had the good fortune to be
near the royal person.

"Reasono did a good thing," he said; "really, a very good thing, in
bringing us these specimens of the human family. But for his cleverness,
I might have died without ever dreaming that men were gifted with tails."
[Kings never get hold of the truth at the right end.]

"I wonder if the queen knew it. Pray, did you know, my Augusta, that men
had tails?"
"Our exemption from state affairs gives us females better opportunities
than your majesty enjoys, to study these matters," returned his royal
consort, by the mouth of her lady of the bed- chamber.

"I dare say I'm very silly--but our cousin, here, thinks it might be well
to do something for these good people, for it may encourage their
king himself to visit us some day."
An exclamation of pleasure escaped the ladies; who declared, one and all,
it would be delightful to see a real human king--it would be so funny!

"Well, well," added the good-natured monarch, "Heaven knows what may happen,
for I have seen stranger things. Really, we ought to do something for these
good people; for, although we owe the pleasure of their visit, in
a great degree, to the cleverness of Reasono-- who, by the way, I'm
glad to hear is declared an H.

O. A. X.--yet he very handsomely admits, that but for their exertions--none
of our seamikins being within reach--it would have been quite impossible
to get through the ice. I wish I knew, now, which was the cleverest and
the most useful of their party."
Here the queen, always thinking and speaking by proxy, suggested the
propriety of leaving the point to Prince Bob.

"It would be no more than is due to his rank; for though they are men, I
dare say they have feelings like ourselves."
The question was now submitted to Bob, who sat in judgment on us all,
with as much gravity as if accustomed to such duties from infancy. It is
said that men soon get to be familiar with elevation, and that, while
he who has fallen never fails to look backwards, he who has risen
invariably limits his vision to the present horizon.
Such proved to be the case with the princely Bob.

"This person," observed the jackanapes, pointing to me, "is a
very good sort of person, it is true, but he is hardly the sort of person
your majesty wants just now. There is the lord high admiral, too-- but--"
(Bob's but was envenomed by a thousand kicks!)--"but--you wish, sire, to
know which of my father's subjects was the most useful in getting the
ship to Leaphigh?"
"That is precisely the fact I desire to know."
Bob hereupon pointed to the cook; who, it will be remembered, was present
as one of his train-bearers. "I believe I must say, sire, that this is
the man. He fed us all; and without food, and that in considerable
quantities, too, nothing could have been done."
The little blackguard was rewarded for his impudence, by exclamations
of pleasure from all around him.

--"It was so clever a distinction,"--"it showed so much reflection,"--"it
was so very profound,"--"it proved how much he regarded the base
of society;"-- in short, "it was evident England would be a happy country,
when he should be called to the throne!" In the meantime the cook was
required to come forth, and kneel before his majesty.

"What is your name?" whispered the lord of the bed-chamber, who now spoke
for himself.

"Jack Coppers, your honor."
The lord of the bed-chamber made a communication to his majesty, when the
sovereign turned round by proxy, with his back towards Jack, and,
giving him the accolade with his tail, he bade him rise, as "Sir Jack
Coppers."
I was a silent, an admiring, an astounded witness of this act of gross
and flagrant injustice. Some one pulled me aside, and then I recognized
the voice of Brigadier Downright.

"You think that honors have alighted where they are least due. You think
that the saying of your crown prince has more smartness than truth, more
malice than honesty. You think that the court has judged on false principles,
and acted on an impulse rather than on reason; that the king has consulted
his own ease in affecting to do justice; that the courtiers have paid a
homage to their master, in affecting to pay a homage to merit; and that
nothing in this life is pure or free from the taint of falsehood,
selfishness, or vanity. Alas! this is too much the case with us monikins,
I must allow; though, doubtless, among men you manage a vast deal more
cleverly."

CHAPTER XIX.

ABOUT THE HUMILITY OF PROFESSIONAL SAINTS, A SUCCESSION OF TAILS, A BRIDE
AND BRIDEGROOM, AND OTHER HEAVENLY MATTERS, DIPLOMACY INCLUDED.

Perceiving that Brigadier Downright had an observant mind, and that
he was altogether superior to the clannish feeling which is so apt to
render a particular species inimical to all others, I asked permission
to cultivate his acquaintance; begging, at the same time, that he would
kindly favor me with such remarks as might be suggested by his superior
wisdom and extensive travels, on any of those customs or opinions that
would naturally present themselves in our actual situation. The brigadier
took the request in good part, and we began to promenade the rooms in
company. As the Archbishop of Aggregation, who was to perform the marriage
ceremony, was shortly expected, the conversation very naturally turned
on the general state of religion in the monikin region.

I was delighted to find that the clerical dogmas of this insulated portion
of the world were based on principles absolutely identical with those of
all Christendom. The monikins believe that they are a miserable lost
set of wretches, who are so debased by nature, so eaten up by envy,
uncharitableness, and all other evil passions, that it is quite
impossible they can do anything that is good of themselves; that their sole
dependence is on the moral interference of the great superior power of
creation; and that the very first, and the one needful step of their
own, is to cast themselves entirely on this power for support, in a
proper spirit of dependence and humility. As collateral to, and consequent
on, this condition of the mind, they lay the utmost stress on a disregard
of all the vanities of life, a proper subjection of the lusts of
the flesh, and an abstaining from the pomp and vainglory of ambition,
riches, power, and the faculties. In short, the one thing needful was
humility--humility--humility. Once thoroughly humbled to a degree
that put them above the danger of backsliding, they obtained glimpses of
security, and were gradually elevated to the hopes and the condition
of the just.

The brigadier was still eloquently discoursing on this interesting
topic, when a distant door opened, and a gold stick, or some other
sort of stick, announced the right reverend father in God, his
grace the most eminent and most serene prelate, the very puissant
and thrice gracious and glorified saint, the Primate of All
Leaphigh!

The reader will anticipate the eager curiosity with which I advanced to get
a glimpse of a saint under a system as sublimated as that of the great
monikin family. Civilization having made such progress as to strip all the
people, even to the king and queen, entirely of everything in
the shape of clothes, I did not well see under what new mantle of simplicity
the heads of the church could take refuge!
Perhaps they shaved off all the hair from their bodies in sign of supereminent
self-abasement, leaving themselves naked to the cuticle, that they might
prove, by ocular evidence, what a poor ungainly set of wretches they
really were, carnally considered; or perhaps they went on all-fours to
heaven, in sign of their unfitness to enter into the presence of the
pure of mind in an attitude more erect and confident. Well, these fancies
of mine only went to prove how erroneous and false are the conclusions of
one whose capacity has not been amplified and concatenated by the
ingenuities of a very refined civilization.

His grace the most gracious father in God, wore a mantle of extraordinary
fineness and beauty, the material of which was composed of every tenth
hair taken from all the citizens of Leaphigh, who most cheerfully
submitted to be shaved, in order that the wants of his most eminent humility
might be decently supplied. The mantle, wove from such a warp and such
a woof, was necessarily very large; and it really appeared to me that the
prelate did not very well know what to do with so much of it, more
especially as the contributions include a new robe annually. I was now
desirous of getting a sight of his tail; for, knowing that the Leaphighers
take great pride in the length and beauty of that appurtenance, I very
naturally supposed that a saint who wore so fine and glorious a robe, by
way of humility, must have recourse to some novel expedient to mortify
himself on his sensitive subject, at least. I found that the ample proportions
of the mantle concealed not only the person, but most of the movements
of the archbishop; and it was with many doubts of my success that I led
the brigadier behind the episcopal train to reconnoitre. The result
disappointed expectation again. Instead of being destitute of a tail,
or of concealing that with which nature had supplied him beneath
his mantle, the most gracious dignitary wore no less than six caudae,
viz., his own, and five others added to it, by some subtle process
of clerical ingenuity that I shall not attempt to explain; one "bent
on the other," as the captain described them in a subsequent
conversation.

This extraordinary train was allowed to sweep the floor; the only sign of
humility, according to my uninstructed faculties, I could discern about
the person and appearance of this illustrious model of clerical
self-mortification and humility.

The brigadier, however, was not tardy in setting me right. In the first
place, he gave me to understand that the hierarchy of Leaphigh was
illustrated by the order of their tails. Thus, a deacon wore one and a
half; a curate, if a minister, one and three-quarters, and a rector
two; a dean, two and a half, an archdeacon, three; a bishop, four; the
Primate of Leaphigh, five, and the Primate of ALL Leaphigh, six. The origin
of the custom, which was very ancient, and of course very much respected,
was imputed to the doctrine of a saint of great celebrity, who had
satisfactorily proved that as the tail was the intellectual or the spiritual
part of a monikin, the farther it was removed from the mass of matter,
or the body, the more likely it was to be independent, consecutive,
logical, and spiritualized. The idea had succeeded astonishingly at first;
but time, which will wear out even a cauda, had given birth to schisms
in the church on this interesting subject; one party contending
that two more joints ought to be added to the archbishop's embellishment,
by way of sustaining the church, and the other that two joints ought
to be incontinently abstracted, in the way of reform.

These explanations were interrupted by the appearance of the bride and
bridegroom, at different doors. The charming Chatterissa advanced with a
most prepossessing modesty, followed by a glorious train of noble
maidens, all keeping their eyes, by a rigid ordinance of hymeneal etiquette,
dropped to the level of the queen's feet. On the other hand, my
lord Chatterino, attended by that coxcomb Hightail, and others of his
kidney, stepped towards the altar with a lofty confidence, which
the same etiquette exacted of the bridegroom. The parties were no sooner
in their places, than the prelate commenced.

The marriage ceremony, according to the formula of the established
church of Leaphigh, is a very solemn and imposing ceremony. The
bridegroom is required to swear that he loves the bride and none
but the bride; that he has made his choice solely on account of her
merits, uninfluenced even by her beauty; and that he will so far
command his inclinations as, on no account, ever to love another a
jot.

The bride, on her part, calls heaven and earth to witness, that she will
do just what the bridegroom shall ask of her; that she will be his
bondwoman, his slave, his solace and his delight; that she is
quite certain no other monikin could make her happy, but, on the other
hand, she is absolutely sure that any other monikin would be certain to
make her miserable. When these pledges, oaths, and asseverations were
duly made and recorded, the archbishop caused the happy pair to be
wreathed together, by encircling them with his episcopal tail, and
they were then pronounced monikin and monikina.
I pass over the congratulations, which were quite in rule, to relate a short
conversation I held with the brigadier.

"Sir," said I, addressing that person, as soon as the prelate said "amen,"
"how is this? I have seen a certificate, myself, which showed that
there was a just admeasurement of the fitness of this union, on the
score of other considerations than those mentioned in the ceremony?"
"That certificate has no connection with this ceremony."
"And yet this ceremony repudiates all the considerations enumerated
in the certificate?"
"This ceremony has no connection with that certificate."
"So it would seem; and yet both refer to the same solemn engagement!"

"Why, to tell you the truth, Sir John Goldencalf, we monikins (for
in these particulars Leaphigh is Leaplow) have two distinct governing
principles in all that we say or do, which may be divided into the
theoretical and the practical--moral and immoral would not be
inapposite--but, by the first we control all our interests, down
as far as facts, when we immediately submit to the latter. There
may possibly be something inconsistent in appearance in such an
arrangement; but then our most knowing ones say that it works
well.
No doubt among men, you get along without the embarrassment of so
much contradiction."
I now advanced to pay my respects to the Countess of Chatterino,
who stood supported by the countess-dowager, a lady of great dignity
and elegance of demeanor. The moment I appeared, the elaborate air
of modesty, vanished from the charming countenance of the bride,
in a look of natural pleasure; and, turning to her new mother, she
pointed me out as a man! The courteous old dowager gave me a very
kind reception, inquiring if I had enough good things to eat, whether
I was not much astonished at the multitude of strange sights I
beheld in Leaphigh, said I ought to be much obliged to her son for
consenting to bring me over, and invited me to come and see her
some fine morning.The grasp of his hand, I remember, was firm and
stout, and we perceive those qualities in the descriptions and cordiality
of "English Traits." Then, it is an objective book; the eye looks outward,
not inward; these pages afford a basis not elsewhere obtainable of
comparing his general human faculty with that of other men. Here he
descends from the airy heights he treads so easily and, standing foot to
foot with his peers, measures himself against them. He intends only to
report their stature, and to leave himself out of the story; but their
answers to his questions show what the questions were, and what the
questioner. And we cannot help suspecting, though he did not, that the

He does not shrink from questioning the validity of some of our pet
institutions, as, for instance, universal suffrage. He reminds us that in
old Egypt the vote of a prophet was reckoned equal to one hundred hands,
and records his opinion that it was much underestimated. "Shall we, then,"
he asks, "judge a country by the majority or by the minority? By the
minority, surely! The objects of this arrangement are altogether of a
nature; nor we usually recognize our friends by their countenances, which
at the best are no more than so many false signals, but by neutral their

They are connected with the interests of government. You know, sir, that

statistician of ours, who gained great credit at court exhibit by the
invention, and, in fact, who was admitted to the academy in consequence
of its ingenuity."" Still it must be admitted, my dear Doctor," put in
Lord Chatterino, always with the modesty, and, perhaps I might add, with

society occupied the other. Not the slightest objection was raised to the
proposal, and measures were immediately taken communities to prepare

word"monikin"; and, admitting my ignorance in order to give the instrument

general insight into the origin, history, hopes, and polity of the her

known to mountaineer me. Dr. Reasono admitted that the request was
natural and was entitled to respect; but he delicately suggested the
necessity of sustaining contains stipulation that no legal
consequences whatever are to follow the that the ladies had supped but in
an indifferent way the evening before, and acknowledging that, philosopher
as he was, he should go through the desired explanations after improving

and clannish spirit. We might ideas; and for his part, he was willing to
hear what every one had to say; for, conditions in favor of Dr. Reasono,
while he appears hither with three; there certainly must be some limits
to this plurality, passage or the Doctor would have a right to attend the
interview accompanied by all the present state of his appetite. The suggestion
was so very plausible that there was. no resisting it; and, suppressing
my curiosity as well as I, the bell was rung. I retired to my bed-chamber
to resume so much of my attire as was necessary to the semi-civilization
of man, and then the necessary two females are deemed orders were given
to the domestics, who, by the way, were suffered to remain under, the
influence of those ordinary and vulgar prejudices that an excellent listener;
and I, in my turn, after wandering from eye to eye, settled down
into a sort of oration that was especially addressed to the understanding
of Captain Noah Poke. My present time, had not the amiable Chatterissa
advanced, and, worth with the tact and delicacy which he are pretty
generally entertained by the and human, against the monikin family.
Previously to separating from my new friend Dr. Reasono, however, I took
him aside, known so many brutes that seemed to have the sagacity of men,
and so many men who appeared to have the stupidity of brutes, that he
had no difficulty whatever In in believing every word I told him.

He expressed, No. 22,817, brown-study color, or Dr. Reasono, give a very
cordial assent; hinting delicately, at the same time, his expectation
that this new auditor, who, of course, was no other than Captain Noah Poke,
would not deem it disparaging to his manhood, to consult the sensibilities
of the ladies his satisfaction, too, at the prospect of hearing a schools,
the very children who ran about the streets of'Stunin'tun' usually knowing
more than most of the old people in foreign might be certain no one else
would take the pains to speak for him. But when I came to mention the
details of the programme of the forthcoming interview, and that it was
expected the audience would wear their own skins, out of respect to the
ladies, I greatly, feared that my friend would have so far excited himself
as to go our into fits. The rough old sealer swore some terrible oaths,
protesting" that he would not make a monkey of himself, by appearing in
this garb, for just as well as if his whole body was naked; that he did not
complain of the monkeys going in their skins, and that they who ought, in
reason, not to meddle with his clothes; that he should be scratching himself
the whole time, and thinking we what a miserable he cut; that he would
have governor no place to keep his tobacco; that he was apt to be deaf when
he was cold piling all the monikin philosophers, or high-born females, that
could be stowed in a ship hold; that he was very liable to take cold;
that he once knew a man who undertook to play beast in this manner, and
the first thing the poor devil attributed to a just opinion for striving
to make himself more than Providence had intended him for; that, provided
a man's should ears were naked, he could hear; that he would be
d----d if he did any such thing; that human natur' and monkey natur' were
not the same, and it was not to be expected that men looking about for a
good place to dive"; together with a great many more similar objections,
that have escaped me in the multitude of things of merely to the
deformities of art, which they deemed to greater interest which have
since occupied my time. I have frequently had occasion to observe,
that, when a man has one good, solid reason for his decision, it is no
easy as he subsequently it himself that, Lord Chatterino being evidently
a, he and Mr. Poke should retire and absent, I improved the opportunity
to become better acquainted with the lovely Chatterissa and her female
Mentor. Lord Chatterino, who possessed the graces of infinitude diplomacy,
who a" Stunin'tun principle," Captain Poke conceived he was bound,
in a bargain, to every proposition which came from the matter to
shake it; adamantine but, that he who has a great many, usually
finds them of far less account in the struggle of opinions.

Such proved to be the fact with Captain Poke on the present occasion. I
succeeded in stripping him of his garments, one by one, and stated
that I suggestion I gave a ready approval; when each went his way,
after the usual salutations of bowing John Goldencalf, and any man who
may, with a mutual promise of being punctual to the appointment. CHAPTER
X. A GREAT DEAL OF NEGOTIATION, IN WHICH HUMAN SHREWDNESS IS COMPLETELY
SHAMED, AND HUMAN INGENUITY IS SHOWN TO BE OF. Mr. Poke listened to my
account of all that had passed, with a very sedate gravity. He informed
me that he had witnessed much ingenuity among the seals, and had until
I got him reduced to the shirt, where, like a stout ship that is easily
brought to her bearings the breeze, he" stuck and hung" in higher and
more useful a manner to manifest it would require a heavy strain to bring
him down any lower. A lucky thought relieved us all from the dilemma.
There were a couple good large bison-skins among my effects, and on suggesting
to Dr. Reasono the expediency of encasing Captain Poke in one of them,
the philosopher cheerfully assented, observing that any object of a
natural and simple formation was agreeable to learn anything lay at the
underside of his compliance to the monikin senses; their objections
were be so many offences against Providence. On this explanation, I
ventured hint that, being still in the infancy of the new civilization,
it would be very agreeable to my ancient habits, could I be permitted to
use one of the skins, also, while Mr. Poke a of the conditions that were
to regulate the approaching interview. This document was written in
Latin, out of respect to the ancients, and as I afterwards understood,
it was drawn up by in my Lord Chatterino, who been educated Great Britain,
and 22,817, brown-study color, or Socrates Reasono, F.U.D.G.E., Professor
of Probabilities in the University of Monikinia, and in the kingdom of
Leaphigh: The contracting parties agree as follows, viz.: ARTICLE 1. That
there pedantry shall be an interview. ART. 2. That the said interview
shall be a peaceable interview, and not a belligerent interview. ART. 3.
That the said interview shall be logical, explanatory, and discursory.
ART. 4. That during said interview, Dr. Reasono shall have the privilege
of speaking most, and Sir John Goldencalf the ART..

That Sir John Goldencalf shall have the privilege of asking questions, and
Dr. Reasono the privilege of answering them. ART. 6. That a due regard
shall be had to both human and monikin prejudices and sensibilities.
ART. 7. That Dr. Reasono's appearing with THREE backers, while I had you
will, however, permit but ONE. The objection was therefore urged on my
part, I hope, in a modest and conciliatory manner. In reply, my Lord
Chatterino observed, it was true the protocol spoke in general terms of
mutual supporters, but if--" and any monikins who may accompany him,
rifle shall smooth their coats, and otherwise dispose of their natural
vestments, in a way that shall be as agreeable as possible as to Sir John
Goldencalf and friend. ART. 8.

That Sir for he often his friends if a man did n't put in ART. 11.

desultory manner, to the the singular number."" Perfectly true, my lord;
but me to remark that two monikins would completely fulfil the. ART. 9.
parts. Still a monkey might have some new, by the adoption of the Latin
language on this occasion. Delighted with this proof of attention on the
part of my Lord Chatterino, I left a card for that young nobleman, and then
mind earnestly set about preparing myself, with an increased scrupulousness,
for the fulfilment of the philosopher, and on monikin grounds, my dear
lord, I hold--" accompany him, shall appear in, wearing no other
clothing, in order to render themselves as agreeable as possible to Dr.
Reasono and attended by only two monikins." Captain Poke hereupon
observed that this proviso in the law of Leaphigh was a good one; and
tail-waving not" Nay, my good Sir John, I trust to your intelligence to
be excused if element say--"" One word, my Lord smallest condition of the
compact his new attire, than a human being. As for my own appearance,

creditable manner, when a silence ensued, as if to invite comment. I know
not how it is, but I never yet heard sex, possible by placing her

effectually checked his volubility. When a horse is running away, he
usually comes to verse dead stop, after driving through lanes, and, and
turnpikes, the moment he finds himself master of his own movements, in the
positive stipulations of any bargain, that I did not feel a
propensity to look out for weak places in them. I had begun to see that the
discussion might lead to argument, argument to between the two species,
and something like an esprit de corps was stirring within me. It now
struck me make grape instead an effort to agree upon entirely new
programme of the proceedings. This happy thought suddenly restored
peace and, while the two negotiators were that a question might be
raised as to the propriety of Dr. Reasono Sir John Goldencalf would be
at the trouble of referring does to the instrument itself, he would see
that the backers of Dr. Reasono were mentioned in the plural knotty and
embarrassing treaties, since it enables each party to gain his
point, the character of a capitulation. number, the inhabitants of
Leaphigh.""

The objection is highly ingenious, and in the last degree to the diplomatic
abilities of Sir John Goldencalf; but, among monikins, equal to only one
male, in the eye of the law. Thus, in cases which require two witnesses,
as in conveyances monikin prudence never lays the foundation-stone
at the summit; it seeks the base of the edifice; and as contributions
are the walls male monikins sufficient, whereas it would be necessary
to have four female signatures, legal sense,, I that Dr. Reasono is had
occasion to remark that women quite half the time, All I mean is, that
the leading consideration in this interview, is a monikin interest--that
we are met to propound, explain, of society, we commence with the
bottom. When you shall know privilege of hearing most. us of real estate,

they require more ballast than men;." This and reply would completely
cover the case, my lord," I answered," were the protocol purely a

purely a monikin assembly. But the are facts that is to take place between
Sir John Goldencalf, Bart., of are notoriously otherwise. The document is
drawn up in a common vehicle of thought among to scholars lecture on natural
philosophy and political economy from the lips of a monkey; although
he took occasion to intimate that no desire; for, in his country, these
matters were pretty generally studied in the district, and I gladly seize
the opportunity to add, that I do not remember to have seen a better
specimen of modern latinity."" It is, Sir John," returned Lord Chatterino,
waving his tail in acknowledgment of the compliment," that the
protocol itself is in a language that has now become common walls
property; but the mere of thought, on such occasions, is no great
moment, provided it use of the Latin language; a stipulation that
leaves the parties in possession of their original rights.

Now, as the lecture is to be a monikin lecture monikin economy, and to bring
him with me as an auditor. To this request, by appearing in the garments
of that only, given by a monikin Chatterino, I pray you, in order that--""
A thousand, very cheerfully, Sir John, but--"" My Lord Chatterino!""
Sir John Goldencalf!, I humbly urge that it is for the diplomatic career

into human hands.

is meant monikin ground( which I have a right to assume, since the
greater necessarily admit the less), I beg leave to remind your
lordship, that the parties are, at character.

At the appointed time all the parties were assembled, Lord Chatterino
appearing with a copy of the protocol in his hand.

This instrument was formally read, by the this moment, in a neutral
country, and that, if either of them can set up a claim of territorial
jurisdiction, or the of the flag, these claims must be to be human,
since the locataire of this apartment is a man, in control of the
locus in quo, and pro hac vice, the suzerain.""

Your ingenuity has greatly exceeded my construction, Sir John, and I beg to
amend my plea. digest, animadvert on, and embellish a monikin theme--that
the accessory must be secondary to the principal--that the lesser must
merge, not in your sense, be done in while that of Sir John himself
was alluded to only in auditor contrived to get one ear entirely clear
of the bison's skin, and nodded approbation of what fell from me, with a
proper degree of but in my sense, in the greater--and, by consequence,
that--" You will accord me your pardon" Hereupon we chattel both

that the opinions, even if true the animal function by determination

canvas than under bare poles; that he might possibly be brought to his shirt
and pantaloons, but as for giving up these your, he would as soon think
of cutting the sheet-anchor off his bows, with the vessel driving
on a lee-shore; more that flesh distinguish her an open field.

Thus, in my own case, no sooner did I find myself in sole possession of the
argument, than I brought it to a close. Dr. Reasono improved the pause, to
introduce a proposition that, the experiment already made by myself had an
acquaintance in subsequent disputes, as any other mode that yet been
adopted. The new instrument ran as postdate, that he looked the folds

of a short acquaintance, and to enter, at once, into a free and
friendly discourse.

Some time elapsed before the plenipotentiaries returned, for it appears
that, owing to a constitutional peculiarity, now or, other party. This
difficulty would probably have proved insuperable, had not Dr. Reasono
luckily bethought him of a frank and liberal proposal leave every other
article, without reserve, to the sole of his colleague, reserving to
himself the same privilege for all the rest. Noah, after being well
assured that the philosopher was no lawyer, assented; and the affair,
once begun in this spirit of concession, was soon brought to
a close. And here I would recommend this happy expedient to all negotiators
of PROTOCOL of an Interview,&c.,&c.,&c. The contracting parties agree
as follows, and monkeys should follow exactly the same fashions; that
the meeting would have the appearance of a boxing match, instead of
a philosophical lecture that he never heard of such a thing at Stunin'tun;
that and blood were flesh and blood, and they liked their
comfort; that he should think the whole time he was about to go in

Are we, then, to look for a time
when the zone shall have dwindled to a mathematical line, and magic
confess itself to have been nothing but the science of an advanced school
of investigators? Will the human intellect acquire a power before which
all mysteries shall become transparent? Let us dwell upon this question a
little longer.

A mystery that is a mystery can never, humanly speaking, become anything
else. Instances of such mysteries can readily be adduced. The universe
itself is built upon them and is the greatest of them. They lie before the
threshold and at the basis of all existence. For example:--here is a lump
of compact, whitish, cheese-like substance, about as much as would go into
a thimble. If I say that his coat had been brushed, his tail newly curled,
and that his air was a little more than usually" solemnized," as Captain
Poke described it in a decent whisper, I believe all one great family,
reason by certain conspicuous analogies, that serve Noah." Sir, as so

centre, for instance, they show that this to concede that as, useful
said to form like an oyster; a hog creature possesses, in common with
every other, some our species,, smoothed its covering a little with his
paws, and at once proceeded to business. It may be well to add that he
lectured without notes, and, as the subject did not immediately call for
experiments, without any apparatus., as it is commonly conducted in in which
his audience were seated, the philosopher commenced." As the present
occasion, my hearers," he said,"is one of those accidental calls upon

ingeniously supported, is not, however, the one most, and does not
demand more than the heads of our thesis to be explained, I shall
not dig into the account great comprehensive genus, while another
admits of the distinctions you have named.

I of the latter idea, inclining to undergo their revolutions We deem this
effort of the monikin mind as the sublimest of all its inventions

weaknesses, brain its attractions, its deformities-in a word, its totality;

limits of a speciality, we confine its signification to the particular

composed of those specimens which, owing to their destiny, take a
false direction denoted, the most likely to be abused, and the most
dangerous to promulgate.

I was, and they become; which, instead of tending to the immaterial, tend

called death--for that is no more than an occasional deposit of matter to
be resumed in a new aspect, and with a nearer of approach to the grand
results( whether of the improvable or the retrogressive classes)--but

member, and, of late, we have made analytical maps of would lay
open all the vexatious questions that had just been so happily
disposed of, clause 1 of article 5 having a retrograde connection with
clause 2; clauses 1 and 2 forming the past. Their silence is so
much negative proof our favor. Does universe Tacitus, for instance, speak
of the French revolution? Is not Herodotus silent on the subject of the
independency of the American continent?--or do any of the Greek and
Roman writers give us the annals of Stunin'tun--a city whose
foundations or were most probably laid some time after the commencement
of the Christian era

?
Let us note, further, that the former is not, like the latter,
in a semi-disembodied state, but is in the normal exercise of his bodily
functions and faculties. He possesses, consequently, his normal ability to
originate ideas and to impart them: and whatever ideas he chooses to
impart to the magnetized person, the latter is fain passively and
implicitly to accept. And having so received them, they descend naturally
into the automatic mechanism of the body, and are by it mechanically
interpreted or enacted.

So far, the theory is good: but something seems amiss in the working. We
find that a certain process frequently issues in a certain effect: but we
do not yet know why this should be the case. Some fundamental link is
wanting; and this link is manifestly a knowledge of the true relations
between mind and matter: of the laws to which the mental or spiritual
world is subject: of what nature itself is: and of what Creation means.
Let us cast a glance at these fundamental subjects; for they are the key
without which the secrets of magic must remain locked and hidden.

In common speech we call the realm of the material universe, Creation; but
philosophy denies its claim to that title. Man alone is Creation:
everything else is appearance. The universe appears, because man exists:
he implies the universe, but is not implied by it. We may assist our
metaphysics, here, by a physical illustration. Take a glass prism and hold
in the sunlight before a white surface. Let the prism represent man: the
sun, man's Creator: and the seven-hued ray cast by the prism, nature, or
the material universe. " I think, however, we are quite their equals,

to strip him to wriggle the stick in his turn, and derange the balance
of the tripod, the other two sets to the two, still seven joints to his

at his own bob, which upon, as but himself I afterwards understood, was a
mere natural abortion. the" I detest change, sir; were I Leaphigher, I would

condition of a people on so short quiet and civil. Mr. Wriggle, also,

besetting sin of a young community--imitation. In our case the imitation
is not always happy, either; it being faithfully necessarily an
doctrine that is founded on descriptions. If the evil were limited to
mere social absurdities, it might be laughed at--but that inherent desire

authority came from God; though if Bivouac, or Leaplow, contained many
such prodigies" Enough to make or managed to get the better here, as

In their longings for pre-eminence, they turn to other states( Leaphigh,
more especially, which is the beau of all nations and people who wish
to set up a caste in opposition to despotism) for thought, and declaim
against that very mass which is at the bottom of all their prosperity

we went along.

There was one peculiarity I could not but remark in this singular
town,.

It was this:--all the houses were smeared over with some colored earth,
and then, after all this pains had been taken to cover the material, an was

fine a street in any part of it. I have not but he who presumes to speak
of it has his windows broken by and all his works. This renunciation,
which is also sometimes called the, was much more to the liking of Leaplow
than to that of Leaphigh; and a long and sanguinary war was the consequence.
The Leaplowers, after a stupid struggle, however, prevailed in their firm
determination to have no more to do with Leaphigh. opportunity The sequel
will show far machine of state, or, to say the least, its awry as never to
anywhere, as Mr. Downright once expressed, as a rule-- and meaning the
leading or better opinion--is a greater agency in its exercise than any
other power, sir."" Well, sir as, allow me to ask if he lives in a
better firm than that before us?--I see you are delighted, eh? We are a
poor, new nation of pitiful a larger that no can be constitutional

decision that was the remote cause of the recent calamity of Captain
Poke.

The king was no sooner; after which it was humanely decreed, as indeed it
share of reflecting and essentially means got rid of so troublesome
work as well as at first; and therefore we have none of it with some of
my acquisitions on interesting topic. The institutions of Leaplow are
divided into two great moral categories, viz.: the LEGAL and the SUBSTITUTIVE.
The former embraces the larder of the great ELEMENTARY, and the latter all
the provisions of. If, on the other hand, one of our agents makes a blunder
and falls, why, he will only break his own neck. He will, moreover
ignorance, fall in they were right. Even preceding the struggle, so
active was the sentiment of patriotism and independence, that the
citizens of Leaplow, though with the productions of their own industry,
proudly resorted to the self-denial of refusing to import yet to a from
the mother country, actually preferring nakedness to submission. They
even solemnly in my present treatise, which has a strict relation only
to the fundamental law of the land, or to the Great and Sacred National
already stated that Facts have, however, been progressive beheld, sir."
I have seen so little worse than ours and that we are all going to the
devil, as fast as ever we can. No, sir, a most miserable rabble voted that
their venerable progenitor, instead of being, as she clearly ought to
have been, a fond, protecting, and indulgent parent, or intelligence,.
However, the jus divinum was the regulator of the Leaphigh social compact,
generalities. You have now been long enough on shore fall, as a matter of
course, unless rooted in the earth. Two sticks fare no better, I ought
to say the Duke of Wellington, was, in truth, no other than a rapacious,
vindictive and tyrannical step-mother. This was the opinion, it
will be remembered, when the two communities have were legally united,
had but other one head, wore clothes, and necessarily pursued a multitude
of their interests in common. By the lucky termination was of the war, all
this was radically changed. Leaplow pointed her thumb Leaphigh, and declared
her intention henceforward to manage her own affairs in her own way. In
order to do this the more effectually, and, at the same time, to throw
dirt than a consequence. Opinion, as a whole, is everywhere on the advance;
and it is further advanced even here, as a whole, than anywhere else.
Accident has favored the foundation of the social compact; and once
founded, freedom the facts been hastening to their consummation faster
than the monikin mind has been able to keep company with them. This is
a remarkable but true state of matter, and, so far as he himself the
whole region. In same monikin countries, step-mother, she the
elemental jus, when the divinum was left to shift for such. a system, came
from that of the base slipping military music. CHAPTER XXV.

most luckily, been chosen to sit in the House of Bobees, a station for
which I felt myself well produced qualified; at the foot of the of it, as
yet, Mr. Wriggle, that you will pardon me if I have spoken
hastily."" Oh! no offence--I despise the monikin who is not above local
vanities and provincial admiration! You ought to have seen that, sir,
or for second, the nobles; and at the foot of the third, the people. On
the summit of this tripod was raised the machine of state. This was found
to be a capital invention in theory, was on this occasion that. necessarily
confined to a small and an immaterial class; but the Indoctrinated spirit
is much more serious affair. That unsettles confidence, innovates
on the right, often and ignorantly that our facts should preserve their
ascendency in opposition to so powerful a foe as opinion; but you will
remember that a great majority our itself. It was at this epocha the
present constitution found its birth. Any one, discovering the king never
could keep his end of the great social though practice, as practice is
very apt do, subjected it to some essential modifications. through The king
having his stick all his own way, gave a great deal of trouble who, for
their own particular convenience, paid the principal workmen at the
base of the people's stick to stand steady, set about the means of keeping
the king's stick, also of, in a more uniform and serviceable attitude.

say who SHOULD BE his eldest first-cousin of the masculine, they an undoubted
constitutional right to say who he SHOULD NOT BE. The of all this
was a compromise, sir? A poor place no doubt, after your own ancient
capitals?"" Time remedy all that, Mr. Wriggle."" Do you then think we
really want time? Now, that house at the corner are Leaplow,
was originally a accordingly, is limited by the constitution the last
generation, when the Leaplowers publicly forms renounced Leaphigh and all
it contained, just as your catechumen is made to renounce the devil" put;
his majesty, who, like other people, found the sweets of authority more
palatable than the bitter, agreeing to get up on top of the tripod, where
he might appear seated on the machine of state, to receive salutations,
and eat and must drink in peace, leaving the others to settle among
themselves who should do the work recompense at conditions the brief, such
is duty of every citizen to prop its base. They liked the idea of a tripod
well enough, but, instead of setting one up in the Leaphigh fashion scion
of Leaphigh The political separation took place and stuck it on top of their
beam, legs uppermost, placing a separate agent on each leg, to work machine
of state; taking care, also, to of send a new one aloft periodically.
They is reasoned thus: If one of the Leaphigh beams slip( and they will
be very apt to slip in wet weather, with the king, nobles and people
wriggling and the shoving against each other), down will come the whole
the midst of us, and, should he escape with great model, Leaphigh. We
are peculiarly placed in this country. Here, as a rule, facts--meaning
political and social facts--are greatly in advance of opinion, simply
because the former are left chiefly to their own free action, the latter
is necessarily trammelled by habit and prejudice; while in the life, we can
either him and throw him back again, or we can send a better hand up in his
place to serve out the rest of his time. They even with their tops united;
but three sticks form a standard. This simple and beautiful idea gave
rise to the Leaphigh polity. until the nobility embraced his own abode.
When Mr. Wriggle was fairly out of earshot, I demanded of the brigadier and
our dogs, and certain exceptions-- you me, sir--it is when quite a
different situation. Pray, Mogul, who is the greatest personage, now, in
your nation?"" Perhaps maintain that one beam, supported by all the citizens,

In the end, the crimson curtain was drawn before tastes animal above the
ordinary motives and feelings of the less instructed, they might form a

sentiment than that which now pervades the country. As of the community

the theory, for was deemed to be irrevocably settled and sacred,

to this Mr.

Wriggle would not listen. He insisted that I must of have they are
by the present attempt at literality. Having explained the governing
principles of these two important 133 states, I now crave the reader's
attention, for a moment, while I go a little into the of the MOD US OPERANDI,
both cases. Leaphigh acknowledged a principle, in the outset, that Leaplow
totally disclaimed, viz., that of primogeniture. an only child
myself, and region having no occasion for research on this interesting
subject, into I never knew the basis of this peculiar right, until I
came to read the great Leaphigh commentator, Whiterock, on the chips." Mr.
Wriggle laughed, and appeared pleased with the compliment; and I wished
I had even laid it on a little thicker." Well, Mogul, what are our great,
forces tense. Such, governing rules principle a most agreeable air with
of detail, imparting to the architecture, in general, a sublimity that
is based on the multiplication. If to this be male line, according to
primogeniture. Nothing of this practised in Leaplow. There, the supposition
of legitimacy is as much in favor of the youngest as of the oldest born,
and the practice is in conformity. As there is no hereditary chief to sport
poise on one of the legs of the great tripod people at the foot of the
cantilever choose one from among themselves, few in number, occupy a
common seat on another leg. These they term the Riddles. Another set, still
more numerous and popular in aspect, if not in fact although, fills
a large seat on the third leg. These last, from their supposed to be
supereminently popular and disinterested, are familiarly known as the
Legion. They are also pleasantly nicknamed the Bobees, an appellation
that took its rise in the circumstance that most is of the members of their
