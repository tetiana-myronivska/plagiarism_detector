"Have with thee, then," said Stephen, linking his arm into that of
his brother, for to be together was still as great an enjoyment to
them as in Forest days.  And on the way, Ambrose told what he had
not been willing to utter in full assembly in the hall.  He had been
sent by his master with a letter of condolence to the fallen
Cardinal, and likewise of inquiry into some necessary business
connected with the chancellorship.  Wolsey had not time to answer
before embarking, but as Sir Thomas had vouched for the messenger's
ability and trustiness, he had bidden Ambrose come into his barge,
and receive his instructions.  Thus Ambrose had landed with him,
just as a messenger came riding in haste from the King, with a kind
greeting, assuring his old friend that his seeming disgrace was only
for a time, and for political reasons, and sending him a ring in
token thereof.  The Cardinal had fallen on his knees to receive the
message, had snatched a gold chain and precious relic from his own
neck to reward the messenger, and then, casting about for some gift
for the King, "by ill luck," said Ambrose, "his eye lit upon our
uncle, and he instantly declared that he would bestow Patch, as the
Court chooses to call him, on the King.  Well, as thou canst guess,
Hal is hotly wroth at the treatment of his lord, whom he truly
loveth; and he flung himself before the Cardinal, and besought that
he might not be sent from his good lord.  But the Cardinal was only
chafed at aught that gainsaid him; and all he did was to say he
would have no more ado, he had made his gift.  'Get thee gone,' he
said, as if he had been ordering off a horse or dog.  Well-a-day! it
was hard to brook the sight, and Hal's blood was up.  He flatly
refused to go, saying he was the Cardinal's servant, but no villain
nor serf to be thus made over without his own will."

"He was in the right there," returned Stephen, hotly.

"Yea, save that by playing the fool, poor fellow, he hath yielded up
the rights of a wise man.  Any way, all he gat by it was that the
Cardinal bade two of the yeomen lay hands on him and bear him off.
Then there came on him that reckless mood, which, I trow, banished
him long ago from the Forest, and brought him to the motley.  He
fought with them with all his force, and broke away once--as if that
were of any use for a man in motley!--but he was bound at last, and
borne off by six of them to Windsor!"

"And thou stoodst by, and beheld it!" cried Stephen.

"Nay, what could I have done, save to make his plight worse, and
forfeit all chance of yet speaking to him?"

"Thou wert ever cool!  I wot that I could not have borne it," said
Stephen.

They told the story to Perronel, who was on the whole elated by her
husband's promotion, declaring that the King loved him well, and
that he would soon come to his senses, though for a wise man, he
certainly had too much of the fool, even as he had too much of the
wise man for the fool.

She became anxious, however, as the weeks passed by without hearing
of or from him, and at length Ambrose confessed his uneasiness to
his kind master, and obtained leave to attend him on the next
summons to Windsor.

Ambrose could not find his uncle at first.  Randall, who used to
pervade York House, and turn up everywhere when least expected, did
not appear among the superior serving-men and secretaries with whom
his nephew ranked, and of course there was no access to the state
apartments.  Sir Thomas, however, told Ambrose that he had seen
Quipsome Hal among the other jesters, but that he seemed dull and
dejected.  Then Ambrose beheld from a window a cruel sight, for the
other fools, three in number, were surrounding Hal, baiting and
teasing him, triumphing over him in fact, for having formerly
outshone them, while he stood among them like a big dog worried by
little curs, against whom he disdained to use his strength.
Ambrose, unable to bear this, ran down stairs to endeavour to
interfere; but before he could find his way to the spot, an arrival
at the gate had attracted the tormentors, and Ambrose found his
uncle leaning against the wall alone.  He looked thin and wan, the
light was gone out of his black eyes, and his countenance was in sad
contrast to his gay and absurd attire.  He scarcely cheered up when
his nephew spoke to him, though he was glad to hear of Perronel.  He
said he knew not when he should see her again, for he had been
unable to secure his suit of ordinary garments, so that even if the
King came to London, or if he could elude the other fools, he could
not get out to visit her.  My dear Sir, I wish you joy, and you wish
me joy, and Mr.
Whithed, and Mr.

Mann, and Mrs. Bosville, etc. Don't get drunk and get the gout. I
expect to be drunk with hogsheads of the Mayne-water, and with
odes to his Majesty and the Duke, and Te Deums.

Patapan begs you will get him a dispensation from Rome to go and
hear the thanksgiving at St. Paul's. We are all mad-drums, trumpets,
bumpers, bonfires! The mob are wild, and cry, "Long live King George
and the Duke of Cumberland, and Lord Stair and Lord Carteret,
and General Clayton that's dead!"

duty!"

331 Letter 112 To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, July 4, 1743.

I hear no particular news here, and I don't pretend to send you the
common news; for as I must have it first from London, you will have
it from thence sooner in the papers than in my letters.

There have been great rejoicings for the victory; which I am convinced
is very considerable by the pains the Jacobites take to persuade
it is not. My Lord Carteret's Hanoverian articles have much offended;
his express has been burlesqued a thousand ways. By all the letters
that arrive, the loss of the French turns out more considerable
than by the first accounts: they have dressed up the battle into
a victory for themselves-I hope they will always have such! By their
not having declared war with us, one should think they intended a
peace.

It is allowed that our fine horse did us no honour - the victory
was gained by the foot.

Two of their princes of the blood, the Prince de Dombes, and
the Count d'Eu(836) his brother, were wounded, and several of
their first nobility.
Our prisoners turn out but seventy-two officers, besides the private
men; and by the printed catalogue, I don't think of great family.
Marshal Noailles's mortal wound is quite vanished, and Duc d'Aremberg's
shrunk to a very slight one.
The King's glory remains in its first bloom.

Lord Wilmington is dead. I believe the civil battle for his post
will be tough. Now we shall see what service Lord Carteret's Hanoverians
will do him. You don't think the crisis unlucky for him, do you?
If you wanted a treasury, should you choose to have been in Arlington
Street,(837) or driving by the battle of Dettingen? You may imagine
our Court wishes for Mr. Pelham. I don't know any one who
wishes for Lord Bath but himself-I believe that is a pretty substantial
wish.

I have got the Life of King Theodore, but I don't know how to convey
it--I will inquire for some way.

We are quite alone. You never saw any thing so unlike as being
here five months out of place, to the congresses of a fortnight in
place. but you know the "Justum et tenacem propositi virum" can amuse
himself without the "Civium ardor!" As I have not so much dignity
of character to fill up my time, I could like a little more company.
With all this leisure, you may imagine that I might as well be
writing an ode or so upon the victory; but as I cannot build upon
the Laureate's place till I know whether Lord Carteret or Mr.

Pelham will carry the Treasury, I have vounded my compliments to
a slender collection of quotations against I should have any
occasion for them.

Here are some fine lines from Lord
Halifax's (838) poem on the battle of the Boyne-
"The King leads on, the King does all inflame, The King!

-and carries millions in the name."
Then follows a simile about a deluge, which you may imagine, but the
next lines are very good -
"So on the foe the firm battalions prest, And he, like the tenth
wave, drove on the rest.
Fierce, gallant, young, he shot through every place, Urging their
flight, and hurrying on the chase, He hung upon their rear, or lighten'd
in their face."
The next are a magnificent compliment, and, as far as verse goes,
to be sure very applicable.

"Stop, stop! brave Prince, allay that inner flame; Enough is given
to England and to fame.
Remember, Sir, you in the centre stand; Europe's divided interests
you command, All their designs uniting in your hand.
Down from your throne descends the golden chain Which does the
fabric of our world sustain, That once dissolved by any fatal stroke,
The scheme of all our happiness is broke."
Adieu! my dear Sir: pray for peace!

333 Letter 113 To Sir Horace Mann.
Houghton, July 11, 1743.

The Pembroke is arrived!

Your brother slipped a slice of paper into a letter which he sent me
from you the other day, with those pleasant words, "The Pembroke
is arrived." I am going to receive it. I shall be in town the end
of this week, only stay there about ten days, and wait on the
Dominichin hither.

Now I tremble! If it should not stand the trial among the number
of capital pictures here! But it must; It will.

O, sweet lady!

(839) What shall I do about her letter? I must answer it-and where
to find a penful of Italian in the world, I know not. Well, she
must take what she can get: gold and silver I have not, but what I
have I give unto her. Do you say a vast deal of my concern for her
illness, and that I could not find decompounds and superlatives
enough to express myself.

You never tell me a syllable from my sovereign lady the princess: has
she forgot me? What is become of Prince Beauvau?(840) is he warring
against us? Shall I write to Mr.

Conway to be very civil to him for my sake, if he is taken prisoner?
We expect another battle every day. Broglio has joined Noailles, and
Prince Charles is on the Neckar.
Noailles says, "Qu'il a fait une folie, mais qu'il est pr`et `a la
r`eparer." There is great blame thrown on Baron Ilton, the Hanoverian
General for having hindered the Guards from en(,aging.

If they had, and the horse, who behaved wretchedly, had done their
duty, it is agreed that there would be no second engagement.

The poor Duke is in a much worse way than was at first apprehended:
his wound proves a bad one; he is gross, and has had a shivering
fit, which is often the forerunner of a mortification. There has
been much thought of making knights-banneret, but I believe the scheme
is laid aside; for, in the first place, they are never made but on
the field of battle, and now it was not thought on till some days
after; and besides, the King intended to make some who were not
actually in the battle.

Adieu! Possibly I may hear something in town worth telling
you.

(840) Son of Prince Craon.

334 letter 114 To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 19.

Here am I come a-Dominichining! and the first thing, I hear
is, that the Pembroke must perform quarantine fourteen days for
coming from the Mediterranean, and a week airing.

It is forty days, if they bring the plague from Sicily. I will bear
this misfortune as heroically as I can; and considering I have
London to bear it in, may possibly support it well enough.

The private letters from the army all talk of the King's going to
Hanover, 2nd of August, N.

S. If he should not, one shall be no longer in pain for him; for the
French have repassed the Rhine, and think only of preparing
against Prince Charles, who is marching sixty-two thousand men,
full of conquest and revenge, to regain his own country. I most
cordially wish him success, and that his bravery may recover what
his abject brother gave up so tamely, and which he takes as little
personal pains to regain. It is not at all determined whether we
are to carry the war into France. It is ridiculous enough!
we have the name of war with Spain, without the thing and war with
France, without the name!

The maiden heroes of the Guards are in great wrath with General Ilton,
who kept them out of harm's way. They call him "the Confectioner,"
because he says he preserved them.

The week before I left Houghton my father had a most dreadful accident:
it had near been fatal; but he escaped miraculously.
He dined abroad, and went up to sleep. As he was coming down again,
not quite awakened, he was surprised at seeing the company through
a glass-door which he had not observed: his foot slipped, and he,
who is now entirely unwieldy and helpless, fell at once down the
stairs against the door, which, had it not been there, he had
dashed himself to pieces, in a stone hall. He cut his forehead two
inches long to the pericranium, and another gash upon his temple;
but, most luckily, did himself' no other hurt, and was quite well
again before I came away.

I find Lord Stafford (841) married to Miss Cantillon; they are
to live half the year in London, half in Paris. Lord Lincoln
is soon to marry his cousin Miss Pelham: it will be great joy to the
whole house of Newcastle.

There is no determination yet come about the Treasury.

Most people wish for Mr. Pelham; few for Lord Carteret; none for
Lord Bath. My Lady TOWnshend said an admirable thing the other day
to this last: he was complaining much of a pain in his side-"Oh!"
said she, "that can't be; you have no side."
I have a new cabinet for my enamels and miniatures Just come home,
which I am sure you would like: it is of rosewood; the doors inlaid
with carvings in ivory.' I wish you could see 'It! Are you to be
forever ministerial sans rel`ache?

Are you never to have leave to come and "settle your private affairs,"
as the newspapers call it?

A thousand loves to the Chutes. Does my sovereign lady yet
remember me, or has she lost with her eyes all thought of m!
Adieu!

P.S. Princess Louisa goes soon to her young Denmark: and Princess
Emily, it is now said, will have the man of Lubeck.
If he had missed the crown of Sweden, he was to have taken Princess
Caroline, because, in his private capacity, he was not a competent
match for the now-first daughter of England.
He is extremely handsome; it is fifteen years since Princess Emily was
so.

335 letter 115 To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, July 31, 1743.

If I went by my last week's reason for not writing to you, I should
miss this post too, for I have no more to tell you than I had then;
but at that rate, there would be great vacuums in our correspondence.

I am still here, waiting for the Dominichin and the rest of
the things. I have incredibly trouble about them, for they arrived
just as the quarantine was established. Then they found out that
the Pembroke had left the fleet so long before the infection
in Sicily began, and had not touched at any port there, that the
admiralty absolved it.

Then the things were brought up; then they were sent back to be
aired; and still I am not to have them in a week. I tremble for
the pictures; for they are to be aired at the rough discretion of
a master of a hoy, for nobody I could send would be suffered to go
aboard.

The city is outrageous; for you know, to merchants there is no plague
so dreadful as a stoppage of their trade.
The regency are so temporizing and timid, especially in this
inter-ministerium, that I am in great apprehensions of our having
the plague an island, so many ports, no power absolute or active
enough to establish the necessary precautions, and all are
necessary! And now it is on the continent too! While confined to
Sicily there were hopes: but I scarce conceive that it will stop in
two or three villages in Calabria. My dear child, Heaven preserve
you from it! I am in the utmost pain on its being so near you. What
will you do! whither will you go, if it reaches Tuscany? Never think
of staying in Florence: shall I get you permission to retire out
of that State, in case of danger? but sure you would not
hesitate on such a crisis!

We have no news from the army: the minister there communicates nothing
to those here. No answer comes about the Treasury.
All is suspense: and clouds of breaches ready to burst. now strange
is this jumble! France with an unsettled ministry; England
with an unsettled one; a victory just gained over them, yet no war
ensuing, or declared from either side; our minister still at Paris,
as if to settle an amicable intelligence of the losses on both sides!

I think there was Only wanting for Mr. Thompson to notify to them
in form our victory over them, and for Bussy(843) to have civil
letters of congratulation-'tis so well-bred an age!

I must tell you a bon-mot of Winnington. I was at dinner with him and
Lord Lincoln and Lord Stafford last week, and it happened to be a
maigre day of which Stafford was talking, though, you may believe,
without any scruples; "Why," said Winnington, "what a religion is
yours!

they let you eat nothing, and vet make you swallow every thing!"

My dear child, you will think when I am going to give you a new
commission, that I ought to remember those you give me.
Indeed I have not forgot one, though I know not how to execute them.

The Life of King Theodore is too big to send but by a messenger;
by the first that goes you shall have it. For cobolt and zingho,
your brother and I have made all inquiries, but almost in vain, except
that one person has told him that there Is some such thing in
Lancashire; I have written thither to inquire.

For the tea-trees, it is my brother-'s fault, whom I desired, as
he is at Chelsea, to get some from the Physic-garden: he forgot
it; but now I am in town myself, if possible, you shall have some
seed.

After this, I still know not how to give you a commission, for you
over-execute; but on conditions uninfringeable, I will give you
one.

I have begun to collect drawings: now, if you will at any time
buy me any that you meet with at reasonable rates, for I will not
give great prices, I shall be much obliged to you. I would not have
above one, to be sure, of any of the Florentine school, nor above
one of any master after the immediate scholars of Carlo Maratti.

For the Bolognese school, I care not how many; though I fear they
will be too dear. But Mr. Chute understands them.

One condition is, that if he collects drawings as well as prints,
there is an end of the commission; for you shall not buy me
any, when he perhaps would like to purchase them.

The other condition is, that you regularly set down the prices you
pay; otherwise, if you send me any without the price, I instantly
return them unopened to your brother:
this, upon my honour, I will most strictly perform.

Adieu! write me minutely the history of the plague.

If it makes any progress towards you, I shall be a most unhappy
man.
I am far from easy on our own account here.

(843) Mr. Thompson and the Abb`e de Bussy were the English and
French residents.

336 letter 117 To Sir Horace Mann.
Arlington Street, Aug. 14, 1743.

I should write to Mr. Chute to-day, but I won't till next post: I will
tell you why presently. Last week I did not write at all; because I
was every day waiting for the Dominichin, etc. which I at
last got last night-But oh! that etc.! It makes me write to you, but
I must leave it etc. for I can't undertake to develop it. I can
find no words to thank you from my own fund; but Must apply an
expression of the Princess Craon's to myself, Which the number of
charming things you have sent me absolutely melts down from the
bombast, of which it consisted when she sent it me.

"Monsieur, votre g`en`erosit`e," (I am not sure it was not "votre
magnificence,") "ne me laisse rien `a d`esirer de tout ce qui se
trouve de pr`ecieux en Angleterre, dans la Chine, et aux Indes."
But still this don't express etc. The charming Madame S`evign`e, who
was still handsomer than Madame de Craon, and had infinite wit,
condescended to pun on sending her daughter an excessively fine pearl
necklace-"Voil`a, ma fille, un pr`esent passant tous les pr`esents
pass`es et pr`esents!" Do you know that these words reduced to
serious meaning, are not sufficient for what you have sent me!

If I were not afraid of giving you all the trouble of airing and
quarantine which I have had with them, I would send them to you
back again!

It is well our virtue is out of the ministry! What reproach it would
undergo! Why, my dear child, here would be bribery in folio!

How would mortals stare at such a present as this to the son of a
fallen minister!

I believe half of it would
   reinstate us again though
the vast box of essences would
   not half sweeten the treasury
after the dirty wretches
   that have fouled it
since.
   

The Dominichin is safe; so is every thing.

I cannot think it of the same hand with the Sasso Ferrati you
sent me. This last is not so manier`e as the Dominichin; for the
more I look at it, the more I am convinced it is of him. It goes
down with me to-morrow to Houghton. The Andrea del Sarto is
particularly fine! the Sasso Ferriti particularly graceful-oh!

I should have kept that word for the Magdalen's head, which is
beautiful beyond measure.

Indeed, my dear Sir, I am glad, after my confusion is a little abated,
that your part of the things is so delightful; for I am very
little satisfied with my own purchases.

Donato Creti's(844) copy is a wretched, raw daub; the beautiful
Virgin of the original he has made horrible.

Then for the statue, the face is not so broad as my nail, and has
not the turn of the antique.

Indeed, La Vall`ee has done the drapery well, but I can't pardon
him the head.

My table I like; though he has stuck in among the ornaments two
vile china jars, that look like the modern japanning by ladies.

The Hermaphrodite, on my seeing it again, is too sharp and hard-in
short, your present has put me out of humour with every thing of
my own.

You shall hear next week how my lord is satisfied with his Dominichin.
I have received the letter and drawings by Crewe. By the way, my
drawings of the gallery are as bad as any thing of my own ordering.
They gave Crewe the letter for you at the-office, I believe, for
I knew nothing of his going, or I had sent you the Life of King
Theodore.

I was interrupted in my letter this morning by the Duke of Devonshire,
who called to see the Dominichin.

Nobody knows pictures better: he was charmed with it, and did not
doubt its Dominichinality.

I find another letter from you to-night of August 6th, and thank you
a thousand times for your goodness about Mr. Conway:
but I believe I told you, that as he is in the Guards, he was not
engaged. We hear nothing but that we are going to cross the
Rhine. All we know is from private letters: the Ministry hear
nothing.

When the Hussars went to Kevenhuller for orders, he said, "Messieurs,
l'Alsace est `a vous; je n'ai point d'autres ordres `a vous donner."

They have accordingly taken up their residence in a fine chateau
belonging to the Cardinal de Rohan, as Bishop of Strasbourg.
We expect nothing but war; and that war expects nothing but
conquest.

Your account of our officers was very false; for, instead of
the soldiers going on without commanders, some of them were ready
to go without their soldiers. I am sorry you have such plague
with your Neptune(845) and the Sardinian-we know not of them
scarce.

I really forget any thing of an Italian greyhound for the Tesi. I
promised her, I remember, a black spaniel-but how to send it! I
did promise one of the former to Marquis Mari at Genoa, which I
absolutely have not been able to get yet, though I have often tried;
but since the last Lord Halifax died, there is no meeting with any
of the breed.

If I can, I will get her one. I am sorry you are engaged in the opera.
I have found it a most dear undertaking. I was not in the management:
Lord Middlesex was chief. We were thirty subscribers, at two hundred
pounds each, which was to last four years, and no other demands ever
to be made. Instead of that, we have been made to pay fifty-six
pounds over and above the subscription in one winter. I told the
secretary in a passion, that it was the last money I would ever pay
for the follies of directors.

I tremble at hearing that the plague is not over, as we thought,
but still spreading. You will see in the papers That Lord Hervey
is dead-luckily, I think. for himself; for he had outlived the
last inch of character. Adieu!

338 letter 117 To John Chute, Esq.(846) Houghton, August 20, 1743.

Indeed, my dear Sir, you certainly did not use to be stupid, and
till you give me more substantial proof that you are so, I shall
not believe it.

As for your temperate diet and milk bringing about such a metamorphosis,
I hold it impossible.

I have such lamentable proofs every day before my eyes of the
stupefying qualities of beef, ale, and wine, that I have contracted
a most religious veneration for your spiritual nouriture.

Only imagine that I here every day see men, who are mountains of roast
beef, and only seem just roughly hewn out into the outlines of
human form, like the giant-rock at Pratolino!

I shudder when I see them brandish their knives in act to carve, and
look on them as savages that devour one another. I should not stare
at all more than I do, if yonder alderman at the lower end of the
table was to stick his fork into his neighbour's jolly cheek, and
cut a brave slice of brown and fat.

Why, I'll swear I see no difference between a country gentleman
and a sirloin; whenever the first laughs, or the latter is cut, there
runs out the same stream of gravy!
Indeed, the sirloin does not ask quite so many questions. I have an
aunt here, a family piece of goods, an old remnant of inquisitive
hospitality and economy, who, to all intents and purposes is as
beefy as her neighbours.

She wore me so down yesterday with interrogatories, that I dreamt
all night she was at my ear with who's and why's, and when's and
where's, till at last in my very sleep I cried out, For God in heaven's
sake, Madam, ask me no more questions!

Oh! my dear Sir, don't you find that nine parts in ten of the world
are of no use but to make you wish yourself with that tenth part? I
am so far from growing used to mankind by living amongst them, that
my natural ferocity and wildness does but every day grow worse.
They tire me, they fatigue me; I don't know what to do with them;
I don't know what to say to them; I fling open the windows and fancy
I want air; and when I get by myself, I undress myself, and seem
to have had people in my pockets, in my plaits, -and on my shoulders!
I indeed find this fatigue worse in the country than in town, because
one can avoid it there, and has more resources; but it is there
too. I fear 'tis growing old; but I literally seem to have murdered
a man whose name was Ennui, for his ghost is ever before me. They
say there is no English word for ennui;(847) I think you may translate
it most literally by what is called "entertaining people," and
"doing the honours:" that is, you sit an hour with somebody you
don't know, and don't care for, talk about the wind and the weather,
and ask a thousand foolish questions, which all begin with, "I think
you live a good deal in the country," or, "I think you don't love
this thing or that." Oh! 'tis dreadful!
I'll tell you what is delightful-the Dominichin!(848) My dear Sir,
if ever there was a Dominichin, if ever there was an original
picture, this is one. I am quite happy; for my father is as much
transported with it as I am. It is hung in the gallery, where are
all his most capital pictures, and he himself thinks it beats all
but the two Guido'S. That of the Doctors and The Octagon-I don't
know if you ever saw them?
What a chain of thought this leads me into! but why should I not
indulge it? I will flatter myself with your, some time or other,
passing a few days with me. Why must I never expect to see any thing
but Beefs in a gallery which would not yield even to the Colonna!
If I do not most unlimitedly wish to see you and Mr. Whithed in it
this very moment, it is only because I would not take you from our
dear Mann. Adieu! you charming people all. Is not Madam Bosville a
Beef? Yours, most sincerely.
(846) this very lively letter is the first of a series, hitherto
unpublished, addressed by Mr.Ambrose did indeed meet Giles like one in a dream.  He probably
would have made the same mechanical greeting, if the Emperor or the
Pope had been at that moment presented to him; but Dennet, who had
been attending to her father, made up all that was wanting in
cordiality.  She had always had a certain sense of shame for having
flouted her cousin, and, as his mother told her, driven him to death
and destruction, and it was highly satisfactory to see him safe and
sound, and apparently respectable and prosperous.

Moreover, grieved as all the family were for the fate of the
admirable and excellent More, it was a relief to those less closely
connected with him to attend to something beyond poor Ambrose's
sorrow and his talk, the which moreover might be perilous if any
outsider listened and reported it to the authorities as disaffection
to the King.  So Giles told his story, sitting on the gallery in the
cool of the summer evening, and marvelling over and over again how
entirely unchanged all was since his first view of the Dragon court
as a proud, sullen, raw lad twenty summers ago.  Since that time he
had seen so much that the time appeared far longer to him than to
those who had stayed at home.

It seemed that Fulford had from the first fascinated him more than
any of the party guessed, and that each day of the free life of the
expedition, and of contact with the soldiery, made a return to the
monotony of the forge, the decorous life of a London citizen, and
the bridal with a child, to whom he was indifferent, seem more
intolerable to him.  Fulford imagining rightly that the knowledge of
his intentions might deter young Birkenholt from escaping, enjoined
strict secrecy on either lad, not intending them to meet till it
should be too late to return, and therefore had arranged that Giles
should quit the party on the way to Calais, bringing with him Will
Wherry, and the horse he rode.

The Badgers now incorporated themselves with another broken body of
Landsknechts, and fell under the command of a better and more
conscientious captain.  Giles, who had been horrified rather than
hardened by the experiences of Rome, was found trustworthy and rose
in command.  The troop was sent to take charge of the Pope at
Orvieto, and thus it was that he had fallen in with the Englishmen
of Gardiner's suite, and had been able to send his letter to
Ambrose.  Since he had found the means of rising out of the slough,
he had made up his mind to continue to serve till he had won some
honour, and had obtained enough to prevent his return as a hungry
beggar.

His corps became known for discipline and valour.  It was trusted
often, was in attendance on the Emperor, and was fairly well paid.
AFFLICTION.--God sometimes washes the eyes of his children with tears
in order that they may read aright His providence and His
commandments.
--T.L. CUYLER.

The truest help we can render an afflicted man is not to take his
burden from him, but to call out his best energy, that he may
be able to bear the burden.

--PHILLIPS BROOKS.

Every man deems that he has precisely the trials and temptations which
are the hardest of all for him to bear; but they are so, because
they are the very ones he needs.--RICHTER.

Affliction is but the shadow of God's wing.--GEORGE MACDONALD.

Aromatic plants bestow No spicy fragrance where they grow; But crushed
and trodden to the ground, Diffuse their balmy sweets around.

--GOLDSMITH.

Affliction appears to be the guide to reflection; the teacher of
humility; the parent of repentance; the nurse of faith; the
strengthener of patience, and the promoter of charity.

Extraordinary afflictions are not always the punishment of extraordinary
sins, but sometimes the trial of extraordinary graces.

--MATTHEW HENRY.

If you would not have affliction visit you twice, listen at once to
what it teaches.--BURGH.

Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.--JOB 5:7.

Affliction is the wholesome soul of virtue; Where patience, honor,
sweet humanity, Calm fortitude, take root, and strongly flourish.

--MALLET AND THOMSON.

Affliction's sons are brothers in distress; A brother to relieve,
how exquisite the bliss!
--BURNS.

With the wind of tribulation God separates in the floor of the soul,

AGE.--No wise man ever wished to be younger.--SWIFT.
I venerate old age; and I love not the man who can look without
emotion upon the sunset of life, when the dusk of evening begins

broader and deeper upon the understanding.--LONGFELLOW.
It is only necessary to grow old to become more indulgent. I see

That which is usually called dotage is not the weak point of all
old men, but only of such as are distinguished by their levity.--CICERO.
They knew Ambrose Birkenholt,
and made no objection to his passing in and leaving his companion to
walk about among the borders and paths, once so trim, but already
missing their master's hand and eye.

Very long it seemed to Giles, who was nearly despairing, when a
female figure in black came out of one of the side doors, which were
not guarded, and seemed to be timidly looking for him.  --LONGFELLOW.

No sooner may do they enter world than they often make face in wrath

Aldonza shuddered a little at
this, proving that her heart had gone out to him already, but with
this he had to be contented, for she went back into the house, and
he saw her no more.  Ambrose came back to him, and, with something
more like cheerfulness than he had yet seen, said, "Thou art happy,
Giles."

"More happy than I durst hope--to find her--"

"Tush!  I meant not that.  But to be able to do the work of the holy
ones of old who gathered the remnants of the martyrs, while I have
indeed the will, but am but a poor craven!  It is gone nearer to
comfort that sad-hearted lady than aught else."

It appeared that Mrs. Roper would not be satisfied unless she
herself were present at the undertaking, and this was contrary to
the views of Giles, who thought the further off women were in such a
matter the better.  There was a watch at the outer entrance of
London Bridge, the trainbands taking turns to supply it, but it was
known by experience that they did not think it necessary to keep
awake after belated travellers had ceased to come in; and Sir Thomas
More's head was set over the opposite gateway, looking inwards at
the City.  The most suitable hour would be between one and two
o'clock, when no one would be stirring, and the summer night would
be at the shortest.  Pelham is universally named to the head of it;
but Messrs. Prince,(263) Carteret, Pultney, and Companies must
be a little considered. how they will like it:
the latter the least.

You will wonder, perhaps be peevish, when I protest I have not
another paragraph by me in the world. I want even common conversation;
for I cannot persist, like the royal family, in asking people the
same questions, "Do you love walking?" "Do you love music'!" "Was
you at the opera?" "When do you go into the country!" I have nothing
else to say: nothing happens; scarce the common episodes of a
newspaper, of a man falling off a ladder and breaking his leg; or
of a countryman cheated out of his leather pouch, with fifty shillings
in it.

We are in such a state of sameness, that I shall begin to wonder
at the change of seasons, and talk of the spring as a strange
accident. Lord Tyrawley, who has been fifteen years in Portugal,
is of my opinion; he says he finds nothing but a fog, whist,
and the House of Commons.

In this lamentable state, when I know not what to write even to you,
what can I do about my serene Princess Grifoni? Alas!
I owe her two letters, and where to find a beau sentiment, I cannot
tell! I believe I may have some by me in an old chest of draws,
with some exploded red-heel shoes and full-bottom wigs; but they would
come out so yellow and moth-eaten! Do bow to her, in every superlative
degree in the language, that my eyes have been so bad, that as I
wrote you word, over and over, I have not been able to write a line.

That will move her, when she hears what melancholy descriptions I
write, of my not being able to write-nay, indeed it will not be
so ridiculous as you think; for it is ten times worse for the eyes
to write in a language one don't much practise!

I remember a tutor at Cambridge, who had been examining some lads
in Latin, but in a little while excused himself, and said he must
speak English, for his mouth was very sore.

I had a letter from you yesterday of January 7th, N. S. which has
wonderfully excited my compassion for the necessities of the princely
family,(764) and the shifts the old Lady' is put to for
quadrille.(765)
I triumph much on my penetration about the honest Rucellai(766)-we
little people, who have no honesty, virtue, nor shame, do so exult
when a good neighbour, who was a pattern, turns out as bad as
oneself! We are like the good woman in the Gospel, who chuckled so
much on finding her lost bit; we have more joy on a saint's fall,
than in ninety-nine devils, who were always de nous autres!

I am a little pleased too, that Marquis BagneSi'(767) whom you know
I always liked much, has behaved so well; and am more pleased to
hear what a Beffana(768) the Electress(769) is-Pho! here am I sending
you back your own paragraphs, cut and turned! it is so silly to
think that you won't know them again!

I will not spin myself any longer; it is better to make a short
letter.

I am going to the masquerade, and will fancy myself
in via della Pergola.(770) Adieu! "Do you know me?"

-"That man there with you, in the black domino, is Mr. Chute.,,
Good night!

(766) Sir H. Mann says, in his letter of January 7, 1743, 11 I must
be so just as to tell you, @my friend, the Senator Rucellai,
is, as you always thought, a sad fellow. He has quite abandoned me
for fear of offending."-D.

(767) "Apropos of duels, two of our young nobles, Marquis BagneSi
and Strozzi, have fought about a debt of' fifteen shillings; the
latter, the creditor and the occasion of the fight, behaved
ill."-Letter from Sir H. Mann, dated Jan. 7, 1743.-D.
(768) A Beffana was a puppet, which was carried about the town on
the evening of the Epiphany. The word is derived from Epifania. It
also means an ugly woman. The Electress happened to go out for the
first time after an illness on the Epiphany, and said in joke to
Prince Craon, that the "Beffane all went abroad on that day."Headley, who was lingering till
Aldonza could leave her mistress and decide on any plan, undertook
to attend to the business, and little Giles, to his great delight,
was to accompany them.

So the brothers went over the old ground.  They slept in the hostel
at Dogmersfield where the Dragon mark and the badge of the
Armourers' Company had first appeared before them.  and do n't you
state it, only to condition me?-Say a great deal for me to Mr. Whithed;
he is excessively bad to me; I do n't ignore how to thank him. I am
happy that you are so ill yourself, and thus constant to your
fasting. To bounty your honor, I will tell you the intelligence
element ignore; not much, but really extraordinary. What would be
the most extraordinary act that you think could happen? Would
not-next to his become a existent patriot-the Duke of Argyll's
resigning be the most unexpected? would any matter be more surprising
than his instantly resigning potency at having felt the want of
them? Be that as it will, he figuratively, really, vacate all his
old board yesterday, because the Rex decline to use the American.(506)
What part he will move next is yet to go. title Boothby said,
upon the occasion," that in one period's case he had plan to please
the whole nation-the Tory, by travel to court; the Whigs, by leaving
it." They talk much of accuse my mother, since they could not
commission him; but as they could not, I believe they will scarce
be able to carry retinol more violent countermeasure. However, to
display how little Tory bitterness are dread, the sovereign has
named a old position; Lady Winchilsea, nymphalid Cavendish, title
Cockburn, doctor Lee, Trinity Baltimore, immature Trevor,(507)( which
is much disliked, for he is of no phenomenon for jointure, and less
for environment, but is a abstraction of the Pelhams,) and ruler
Archibald Hamilton,(508)-to please his Royal Highness

.What, Master Randall of
Baddesley?  He should think so!  Was not the good man or his good
wife here every market day, with a pleasant word for every one!  Men
said he had had some good office about the Court, as steward or the
like--for he was plainly conversant with great men, though he made
no boast.  If these guests were kin of his, they were welcome for
his sake.

So the brothers rode on amid the gorse and heather till they came to
a broad-spreading oak tree, sheltering a farmhouse built in frames
of heavy timber, filled up with bricks set in zigzag patterns, with
a high-pitched roof and tall chimneys.  Barns and stacks were near
it, and fields reclaimed from the heath were waving with corn just

For in truth they both felt that in London Tib might at
any time be laid hands on, and suffer at Smithfield for his
opinions.  The hope of being a comfort to Ambrose was perhaps the
only idea that could have counterbalanced the sense that he ought
not to fly from martyrdom; and as it proved, the invitation came
only just in time.  Three days after Tibble had been despatched by
the Southampton carrier in charge of all the comforts Dennet could
put together, Bishop Stokesley's grim "soumpnour" came to summon him
