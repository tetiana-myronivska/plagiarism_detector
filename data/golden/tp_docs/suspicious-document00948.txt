TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM

FROM HER BOY

    _For the long nights you lay awake_
    _And watched for my unworthy sake:_
    _For your most comfortable hand_
    _That led me through the uneven land:_
    _For all the story-books you read:_
    _For all the pains you comforted:_

    _For all you pitied, all you bore,_
    _In sad and happy days of yore:--_
    _My second Mother, my first Wife,_
    _The angel of my infant life--_
    _From the sick child, now well and old,_
    _Take, nurse, the little book you hold!_

    _And grant it, Heaven, that all who read_
    _May find as dear a nurse at need,_
    _And every child who lists my rhyme,_
    _In the bright, fireside, nursery clime,_
    _May hear it in as kind a voice_
    _As made my childish days rejoice!_

  WHERE GO THE BOATS?                                                   What are you going to add?

  _Mishrakeshi_. Surely, every spot that the dear girl loved.

  

  _King_. Listen, my friend.

  

  The stream of Malini, and on its sands The swan-pairs resting; holy
foot-hill lands Of great Himalaya's sacred ranges, where The yaks
are seen; and under trees that bear Bark hermit-dresses on their
branches high, A doe that on the buck's horn rubs her eye.

  _Clown_ (_aside_). To hear him talk, I should think he was going
to fill up the picture with heavy-bearded hermits.

  _King_. And another ornament that Shakuntala loved I have forgotten
to paint.

  _Clown_. What?

  

  _Mishrakeshi_. Something natural for a girl living in the forest.

  

  _King_.

  

  The siris-blossom, fastened o'er her ear, Whose stamens brush her
cheek; The lotus-chain like autumn moonlight soft Upon her bosom
meek.

  _Clown_. But why does she cover her face with fingers lovely as the
pink water-lily?

  She seems frightened. (_He looks more closely_.) I see. Here is a
bold, bad bee.

  He steals honey, and so he flies to her lotus-face.

  

  _King_. Drive him away.

  

  _Clown_. It is your affair to punish evil-doers.

  

  _King_. True. O welcome guest of the flowering vine, why do you
waste your time in buzzing here?

  Your faithful, loving queen, Perched on a flower, athirst, Is waiting
for you still, Nor tastes the honey first.

  _Mishrakeshi_. A gentlemanly way to drive him off!

  

  _Clown_. This kind are obstinate, even when you warn them.

    

    _King_ (_angrily_). Will you not obey my command? Then listen:

    

  'Tis sweet as virgin blossoms on a tree, The lip I kissed in
love-feasts tenderly; Sting that dear lip, O bee, with cruel power,
And you shall be imprisoned in a flower.

  _Clown_. Well, he doesn't seem afraid of your dreadful punishment.

  (_Laughing. To himself_.) The man is crazy, and I am just as bad,
from associating with him.

  _King_. Will he not go, though I warn him?

  

  _Mishrakeshi_. Love works a curious change even in a brave man.

  

  _Clown_ (_aloud_). It is only a picture, man.

  

  _King_. A picture?

  

  _Mishrakeshi_. I too understand it now. But to him, thoughts are
real experiences.

  _King_. You have done an ill-natured thing.

  

  When I was happy in the sight, And when my heart was warm, You
brought sad memories back, and made My love a painted form.

  (_He sheds a tear_.)

  _Mishrakeshi_. Fate plays strangely with him.

  

  _King_. My friend, how can I endure a grief that has no respite?

  

  I cannot sleep at night And meet her dreaming; I cannot see the
sketch While tears are streaming.

  _Mishrakeshi_.

  My friend, you have indeed atoned--and in her friend's presence--for
the pain you caused by rejecting dear Shakuntala.

  (_Enter the maid_ CHATURIKA.)

  _Maid_. Your Majesty, I was coming back with the box of paint-brushes----
_King_.

  Well?

  _Maid_. I met Queen
  Vasumati with the maid Pingalika.

                                                                    And the
                                                                      queen snatched the box from me, saying: "I will take it to the
king myself."

  _Clown_. How did you escape?

  
  _Maid_. The queen's dress caught on a vine.

And while her maid was setting her free, I excused myself in a hurry.

    _A voice behind the scenes_. Follow
    me, your Majesty.

    _Clown_ (_listening_). Man, the
    she-tiger of the palace is making a spring on her prey.

She means to make one mouthful of the maid.

    
    _King_. My friend, the queen has come because she feels touched in
her honour.

You had better take care of this picture.

      
      _Clown_. "And yourself,"
      you might add. (_He takes
    the picture and rises_.)

If you get out of the trap alive, call for me at the Cloud Balcony.

    And I will hide the thing there
      so that nothing but a pigeon could find it.

(_Exit on the run_.)

    _Mishrakeshi_. Though his heart
      is given to another, he is
    courteous to his early flame. He is a
      constant friend.

    (_Enter the portress with a
    document_.)

_Portress_. Victory to your Majesty.

    
    _King_. Vetravati, did you
    not meet Queen Vasumati?
    

_Portress_. Yes, your Majesty. But she turned back when she saw
that I carried a document.

    _King_. The queen knows times
    and seasons. She will not interrupt
    business.
    

_Portress_. Your Majesty, the minister sends word that in the press
of various business he has attended to only one citizen's suit.

    This he has reduced to writing for
    your Majesty's perusal.
    
    _King_. Give me the document.

(_The portress does so_.)

    _King_ (_reads_). "Be it known
    to his Majesty.

A seafaring merchant named Dhanavriddhi has been lost in a shipwreck.

He is childless, and his property, amounting to several millions,
reverts to the crown.

Will his Majesty take action?"

    (_Sadly_.) It is dreadful to
    be childless. Vetravati, he had
    great riches. There must be
    several wives. Let inquiry be made.

    There may be a wife who is
    with child.
    
    _Portress_.

    We have this moment heard that a
    merchant's daughter of Saketa is his
    wife. And she is soon to become a
    mother.

_King_.

    The child shall receive
    the inheritance. Go, inform the
    minister.
    

_Portress_. Yes, your Majesty.

(_She starts to go_.)

_King_.

Wait a moment.

    
    _Portress_ (_turning back_).
      Yes, your Majesty.

    _King_. After all, what does it
    matter whether he have issue
      or not?

Let King Dushyanta be proclaimed To every sad soul kin That mourns
a kinsman loved and lost, Yet did not plunge in sin.

_Portress_.

    The proclamation shall be made.
    (_She goes out and soon returns_.)
    Your Majesty, the royal
    proclamation was welcomed by the populace as is a timely shower.

    _King_ (_sighing deeply_). Thus,
    when issue fails, wealth passes, on the
    death of the head of the family,
    to a stranger.

    When I die, it will be so with
    the glory of Puru's line.
    
    _Portress_. Heaven avert the omen!

    _King_. Alas! I despised the happiness
    that offered itself to me.
    
    _Mishrakeshi_.

Without doubt, he has dear Shakuntala in mind when he thus reproaches
himself.

_King_.

    
    Could I forsake the virtuous wife
    Who held my best, my future
    life And cherished it for glorious birth, As does the seed-receiving
earth?

_Mishrakeshi_.

    She will not long be forsaken.
      
    _Maid_ (_to the portress_).
      Mistress, the minister's report has doubled our lord's remorse.

Go to the Cloud Balcony and bring Madhavya to dispel his grief.

_Portress_.

A good suggestion.

    (_Exit_.)
      _King_. Alas! The ancestors of Dushyanta are
    in a doubtful case.
      

    For I am childless, and they do not know, When I am
      gone, what child of theirs will bring The
    scriptural oblation; and their tears Already
      mingle with my offering.

    
      _Mishrakeshi_. He is screened from the light,
    and is in darkness.
      

_Maid_.

    Do not give way to grief,
    your Majesty. You are in the
    prime of your years, and the birth
    of a son to one of your other wives will make you blameless before
your ancestors.

    (_To herself_.) He does not heed
    me. The proper medicine is needed for
    any disease. _King_ (_betraying
    his sorrow_). Surely,

    The royal line that flowed A
    river pure and grand, Dies in the
    childless king, Like streams
    in desert sand.

    
    (_He swoons_.)
    _Maid_ (_in distress_). Oh, sir,
    come to yourself.

    
    _Mishrakeski_. Shall I make
    him happy now? No, I heard the mother
    of the gods consoling Shakuntala.

She said that the gods, impatient for the sacrifice, would soon
cause him to welcome his true wife.

I must delay no longer.

I will comfort dear Shakuntala with my tidings.

    (_Exit through the air_.)
      _A voice behind the scenes_.
    Help, help!
      
    _King_ (_comes to himself and listens_).
    It sounds as if Madhavya were in distress.

    _Maid_. Your Majesty, I hope that
      Pingalika and the other maids
    did not catch poor Madhavya with
      the picture in his
    hands.
    

_King_.

Go, Chaturika.

Reprove the queen in my name for not controlling her servants.

    _Maid_. Yes, your Majesty.
    (_Exit_.)
    _The voice_. Help,
    help!
    
    _King_. The Brahman's voice seems
    really changed by fear. Who
    waits without? (_Enter the
    chamberlain_.)
    _Chamberlain_. Your Majesty
    commands?
    
    _King_. See why poor Madhavya is screaming
    so.
    
    _Chamberlain_. I will see.
    (_He goes out, and returns
    trembling_.)
    _King_. Parvatayana, I hope
    it is nothing very dreadful.
    
    _Chamberlain_. I hope not.
    
    _King_. Then why do you tremble
    so? For
    Why should the trembling,
    born Of age, increasing,
    seize Your limbs and bid them shake Like fig-leaves in the breeze?

_Chamberlain_.

    Save your friend, O
    King!
    
    _King_. From what?
    
    _Chamberlain_. From great
    danger.
    
    _King_. Speak plainly, man.
    
    _Chamberlain_. On the Cloud
    Balcony, open to the
    four winds of heaven--
    _King_. What has happened
    there?
    
    _Chamberlain_.
    

While he was resting on its height, Which palace peacocks in their
flight Can hardly reach, he seemed to be Snatched up--by what, we
could not see.

_King_ (_rising quickly_).

    My very palace is invaded by evil
      creatures. To be a king,
    is to be a disappointed man.
      

    The moral stumblings of mine own,
      The daily slips, are scarcely
    known; Who then that rules a
      kingdom, can Guide every deed of every man?

_The voice_.

Hurry, hurry!

    
    _King_ (_hears the voice and
    quickens his steps_). Have no fear,
    my friend.

    _The voice_. Have no fear! When
    something has got me by the back of
    the neck, and is trying to break
    my bones like a piece of sugar-cane!

    _King_ (_looks about_). A bow! a
    bow! (_Enter a Greek woman with
    a bow_.)
    _Greek woman_. A bow and arrows,
    your Majesty. And here are the
    finger-guards.

    (_The king takes the bow and arrows_.)
    
    _Another voice behind the scenes_.
    

Writhe, while I drink the red blood flowing clear And kill you, as
a tiger kills a deer; Let King Dushyanta grasp his bow; but how Can
all his kingly valour save you now?

_King_ (_angrily_).

He scorns me, too!

    In one moment, miserable
      demon, you shall
    die. (_Stringing his
      bow_.)

    Where is the stairway,
      Parvatayana?
    
      _Chamberlain_. Here, your Majesty.

    (_All make haste_.)
      
    _King_ (_Looking about_).
      There is no one here.

    _The Clown's voice_.
      Save me, save me! I see
    you, if you can't see
      me.

I am a mouse in the claws of the cat.

I am done for.

    _King_. You are proud of your
    invisibility. But shall not my
    arrow see you? Stand still. Do not
    hope to escape by clinging to my friend.

My arrow, flying when the bow is bent, Shall slay the wretch and
spare the innocent; When milk is mixed with water in a cup, Swans
leave the water, and the milk drink up.

(_He takes aim.

    Enter_ MATALI _and the clown_.)
    
    _Matali_. O King, as Indra,
    king of the gods, commands,
Seek foes among the evil powers alone; For them your bow should
bend; Not cruel shafts, but glances soft and kind Should fall upon
a friend.

    _King_ (_hastily withdrawing the
    arrow_). It is Matali. Welcome
    to the charioteer of heaven's
    king.

    
    _Clown_. Well! He came within an
    inch of butchering me. And you welcome
    him.

    
    _Matali_ (_smiling_). Hear, O
    King, for what purpose Indra sends
    me to you.

_King_.

    I am all attention.
    
    _Matali_. There is a host of
    demons who call themselves Invincible--the brood of Kalanemi.

    _King_. So Narada has told
    me.
    
    _Matali_.

    
    Heaven's king is powerless; you shall
    smite His foes in battle soon;
    Darkness that overcomes the day, Is scattered by the moon.

    Take your bow at once, enter my
    heavenly chariot, and set
    forth for victory.
    

_King_.

I am grateful for the honour which Indra shows me.

But why did you act thus toward Madhavya?

    _Matali_. I will tell you. I saw that you were overpowered
    by some inner sorrow, and acted thus to rouse you. For
    
    The spurnèd snake will swell his hood; Fire blazes when 'tis stirred;
Brave men are roused to fighting mood By some insulting word.

    _King_. Friend Madhavya, I must obey the bidding of heaven's
    king. Go, acquaint the minister Pishuna with the matter, and
    add these words of mine:
    

    Your wisdom only shall control The kingdom for a time;
    My bow is strung; a distant goal Calls me, and tasks
    sublime.
    

_Clown_. Very well.

    (_Exit_.)
    _Matali_. Enter the chariot. (_The king does so. Exeunt
    omnes_.)
    

ACT VII

    (_Enter, in a chariot that flies
    through the air, the king
    and_ MATALI.)
    _King_.

    Matali, though I have done what Indra
    commanded, I think myself an unprofitable
    servant, when I remember his most
    gracious welcome.

_Matali_.

    O King, know that each considers himself the other's
    debtor.

    For
    You count the service given Small by the welcome paid, Which to the
king of heaven Seems mean for such brave aid.

    _King_. Ah, no! For the honour given me at parting went far
    beyond imagination. Before the gods, he seated me beside him on
his throne.

    And then
    He smiled, because his son Jayanta's heart Beat quicker, by the
self-same wish oppressed, And placed about my neck the heavenly
wreath Still fragrant from the sandal on his breast.

    _Matali_. But what do you not deserve from heaven's
    king? Remember:

    Twice, from peace-loving Indra's sway The demon-thorn
      was plucked away:
    First, by Man-lion's crooked claws; Again,
      by your smooth shafts to-day.
    
      _King_. This merely proves Indra's
    majesty. Remember:
      

    All servants owe success in enterprise To honour
      paid before the great deed's done;
    Could dawn defeat the darkness otherwise Than
      resting on the chariot of the sun?

    
      _Matali_. The feeling becomes you.
    (_After a little_.) See, O King!
      Your glory has the happiness of being published abroad in heaven.

With colours used by nymphs of heaven To make their beauty shine,
Gods write upon the surface given Of many a magic vine, As worth
their song, the simple story Of those brave deeds that made your
glory.

_King_.

Matali, when I passed before, I was intent on fighting the demons,
and did not observe this region.

    Tell me. In which path of the winds
      are we?
    
      _Matali_.

    
      It is the windpath
    sanctified By holy Vishnu's
      second stride; Which, freed from dust of passion, ever Upholds the
threefold heavenly river; And, driving them with reins of light,
Guides the stars in wheeling flight.
_King_. That is why serenity pervades me, body and soul. (_He
observes the path taken by the chariot_.) It seems that we have
descended into the region of the clouds.
_Matali_. How do you perceive it?

_King_.
Plovers that fly from mountain-caves, Steeds that quick-flashing
lightning laves, And chariot-wheels that drip with spray-- A path
o'er pregnant clouds betray.
_Matali_. You are right. And in a moment you will be in the world
over which you bear rule.
_King_ (_looking down_). Matali, our quick descent gives the world
of men a mysterious look. For
The plains appear to melt and fall From mountain peaks that grow
more tall; The trunks of trees no longer hide Nor in their leafy
nests abide; The river network now is clear, For smaller streams
at last appear:
It seems as if some being threw The world to me, for clearer
view.
_Matali_. You are a good observer, O King. (_He looks down,
awe-struck_.) There is a noble loveliness in the earth. _King_.
Matali, what mountain is this, its flanks sinking into the eastern
and into the western sea? It drips liquid gold like a cloud at
sunset.
_Matali_. O King, this is Gold Peak, the mountain of the fairy
centaurs. Here it is that ascetics most fully attain to magic
powers.
See!
The ancient sage, Marichi's son, Child of the Uncreated One, Father
of superhuman life, Dwells here austerely with his wife.
_King_ (_reverently_). I must not neglect the happy chance. I cannot
go farther until I have walked humbly about the holy one.
_Matali_. It is a worthy thought, O King. (_The chariot descends_.)
We have come down to earth.

_King_ (_astonished_). Matali,
The wheels are mute on whirling rim; Unstirred, the dust is lying
there; We do not bump the earth, but skim:
Still, still we seem to fly through air.
_Matali_. Such is the glory of the chariot which obeys you and
Indra.
_King_. In which direction lies the hermitage of Marichi's
son?

_Matali_ (_pointing_). See!
Where stands the hermit, horridly austere, Whom clinging vines are
choking, tough and sore; Half-buried in an ant-hill that has grown
About him, standing post-like and alone; Sun-staring with dim eyes
that know no rest, The dead skin of a serpent on his breast:
So long he stood unmoved, insensate there That birds build nests
within his mat of hair.
_King_ (_gazing_). All honour to one who mortifies the flesh so
terribly.
_Matali_ (_checking the chariot_). We have entered the hermitage
of the ancient sage, whose wife Aditi tends the coral-trees.
_King_.
Here is deeper contentment than in heaven. I seem plunged in a pool
of nectar.

_Matali_ (_stopping the chariot_). Descend, O King.
_King_ (_descending_). But how will you fare?
_Matali_. The chariot obeys the word of command. I too will
descend.
(_He does so_.) Before you, O King, are the groves where the holiest
hermits lead their self-denying life.
_King_. I look with amazement both at their simplicity and at what
they might enjoy.
Their appetites are fed with air Where grows whatever is most fair;
They bathe religiously in pools Which golden lily-pollen cools;
They pray within a jewelled home, Are chaste where nymphs of heaven
roam:
They mortify desire and sin With things that others fast to
win.
_Matali_. The desires of the great aspire high. (_He walks about
and speaks to some one not visible_.) Ancient Shakalya, how is
Marichi's holy son occupied? (_He listens_.) What do you say? That
he is explaining to Aditi, in answer to her question, the duties
of a faithful wife? My matter must await a fitter time. (_He turns
to the king_.) Wait here, O King, in the shade of the ashoka tree,
till I have announced your coming to the sire of Indra.
_King_. Very well. (_Exit_ MATALI. _The king's arm throbs, a happy
omen_.) 
I dare not hope for what I pray; Why thrill--in vain?
For heavenly bliss once thrown away Turns into pain.
_A voice behind the scenes_. Don't! You mustn't be so foolhardy.
Oh, you are always the same.
_King_ (_listening_). No naughtiness could feel at home in this
spot.
Who draws such a rebuke upon himself? (_He looks towards the sound.
In surprise_.) It is a child, but no child in strength. And two
hermit-women are trying to control him.
He drags a struggling lion cub, The lioness' milk half-sucked,
half-missed, Towzles his mane, and tries to drub Him tame with
small, imperious fist.All in the most martial manner
      Marching double-quick;
    While the napkin, like a banner,
      Waves upon the stick!

    Here's enough of fame and pillage,
      Great commander Jane!
    Now that we've been round the village,
      Let's go home again.

THE COW


    The friendly cow all red and white,
      I love with all my heart:
    She gives me cream with all her might,
      To eat with apple-tart.

    She wanders lowing here and there,
      And yet she cannot stray,
    All in the pleasant open air,
      The pleasant light of day;

    And blown by all the winds that pass
      And wet with all the showers,
    She walks among the meadow grass
      And eats the meadow flowers.

HAPPY THOUGHT


    The world is so full of a number of things,
    I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings.


THE WIND


    I saw you toss the kites on high
    And blow the birds about the sky;
    And all around I heard you pass,
    Like ladies' skirts across the grass--
      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

    I saw the different things you did,
    But always you yourself you hid.
    I felt you push, I heard you call,
    I could not see yourself at all--
      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

    O you that are so strong and cold,
    O blower, are you young or old?
    Are you a beast of field and tree,
    Or just a stronger child than me?
      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

[Illustration]


KEEPSAKE MILL


    Over the borders, a sin without pardon,
      Breaking the branches and crawling below,
    Out through the breach in the wall of the garden,
      Down by the banks of the river, we go.

    Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,
      Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,
    Here is the sluice with the race running under--
      Marvellous places, though handy to home!

    Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,
      Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;
    Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,
      Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.

    Years may go by, and the wheel in the river
      Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day,
    Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever
      Long after all of the boys are away.

    Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,
      Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;
    Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,
      Turning and churning that river to foam.

    You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled,
      I with your marble of Saturday last,
    Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled,
      Here we shall meet and remember the past.

GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN


    Children, you are very little,
    And your bones are very brittle;
    If you would grow great and stately,
    You must try to walk sedately.

    You must still be bright and quiet,
    And content with simple diet;
    And remain, through all bewild'ring,
    Innocent and honest children.

    Happy hearts and happy faces,
    Happy play in grassy places--
    That was how, in ancient ages,
    Children grew to kings and sages.

    But the unkind and the unruly,
    And the sort who eat unduly,
    They must never hope for glory--
    Theirs is quite a different story!

    Cruel children, crying babies,
    All grew up as geese and gabies,
    Hated, as their age increases,
    By their nephews and their nieces.

[Illustration]


FOREIGN CHILDREN


    Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
    Little frosty Eskimo,
    Little Turk or Japanee,
    Oh! don't you wish that you were me?

    You have seen the scarlet trees
    And the lions over seas;
    You have eaten ostrich eggs,
    And turned the turtles off their legs.

    Such a life is very fine,
    But it's not so nice as mine:
    You must often, as you trod,
    Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.

    You have curious things to eat,
    I am fed on proper meat;
    You must dwell beyond the foam,
    But I am safe and live at home.
      Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
      Little frosty Eskimo,
      Little Turk or Japanee,
    Oh! don't you wish that you were me?

THE SUN TRAVELS


    The sun is not a-bed, when I
    At night upon my pillow lie;
    Still round the earth his way he takes,
    And morning after morning makes.

    While here at home, in shining day,
    We round the sunny garden play,
    Each little Indian sleepy-head
    Is being kissed and put to bed.

    And when at eve I rise from tea,
    Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;
    And all the children in the West
    Are getting up and being dressed.


THE LAMPLIGHTER


    My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky.
    Don't forget to quote Guizot; also tell him that Lord
    Malmesbury's heavy book was saved solely by the gossip in
    the third and fourth volumes.

    The first two are heavy historical matter that
    would have sunk a 74.
    
    The letter which Reeve wrote in consequence of this has unfortunately
not been preserved, but it is evident from Lord Brougham's reply
that it closely followed the lines suggested by his brother.

    _From Lord Brougham_
    _Cannes, November 17th_.--I have not words to express how
    grateful I feel for your most kind letter, which arrived
    this morning. I fear I must admit all you say on the necessity of
much personal matter.

However, I really feel certain that, with the political and general,
there will be a number of personal anecdotes interspersed.

Thus in the Queen's trial, numberless singular anecdotes, professional
and other; and on the changes of government and the unity of our
administration, strange things of individuals: e.g.

Lord Grey having, six months before taking office in 1830, positively
declared to Lansdowne that he had resolved never to take office;
and in 1822, to me, that unless I would consent to take office, and
be leader in the Commons, nothing should induce him to take part
in any administration--there being then an expectation of an offer
to us; in answer to which I positively refused leaving the progressives.

    I give these as examples of
      what the correspondence contains.
    I quite feel, however, that
      something personal and in early life will be desiderated.

    If you look at my 'Life of
      Robertson' you will see all you refer
    to about his being at Brougham,
      and about the translation of 'Florus,' and other anecdotes, and a
good deal about my grandmother.

    Indeed, in that Life, and in my
      contributions to the 'Law
    Review,' there are numberless
      anecdotes of interest.

    I cannot conclude on this subject
      without expressing how grieved I
    am to see what you say of my old
      and dear friend Richardson.

He wrote in very good spirits last spring, and I fear he has had
some severe illness since.

Pray let me know how this is.

    The mention of him reminds me of an instance that
    matters which derive their whole interest
    from connexion with myself are thus very
    hateful to set down.

    He had given me a sermon and a hymn, written
    by the Principal's father--my great-grandfather.
    When I attended the Glasgow congress
    last year, the hymn was by mere accident sung in the church where
we were on the morning after our arrival:
Let not your hearts with anxious thoughts Be troubled and dismayed,
&c.

    I believe I was the only person in Glasgow who
    knew that the old minister was the
    author, or who knew of his existence.
    [Footnote: Cf. _Life and Times of Lord Brougham_, i. 30.]

Now such things would make the narrative a tissue of mere egotism.

However, I feel the force of your remarks exceedingly.

Certainly when Guizot's book came out, and I was asked my opinion
of it, and some defects were pointed out, I could not avoid saying
there was a worse defect than all they mentioned; there would be a
defect of readers.

    And so it has proved; I have, with all
      my respect for him, and
    desire to read, been unable to get through
      a volume.

    
      I must set about digging
    in my published works for anecdotes;
      and, as in the case of Robertson's Life, I may find a great number
which, apart from personality, may be interesting in their connexion
with events.

    Again repeating my gratitude, believe
      me, most sincerely yours,
    
      H. BROUGHAM.

_To Madame de Tocqueville_ 
Paris, November 15th.

    My dear Madame De
    Tocqueville,--Although on the
    point of leaving Paris, I must
    write two lines to express to you my gratitude for allowing M. de
Beaumont to return to me some of my own letters, which derive some
value in my eyes from their connexion with my ever-lamented and
illustrious friend.

I have had a melancholy satisfaction here in seeing the bust which M.

Salaman has made.

    It surpasses my expectations,
      especially as regards the mouth
        and forehead, and I
        trust that even you will not be entirely disappointed in it.

    _From Lord Clarendon_
      _The Grove, November 19th_.--I
        have only a minute
        for writing, as we have had Princess Alice here all day, and I,
of course, could do nothing but the very easy task of entertaining
her.

    I was very glad to get your
      letter, as I thought you
        were still abroad,
        and I only hope you are as glad to find yourself at home again as
I am, though I am not sorry to have been to Berlin.

    I rather envy you being at Paris
      during the late crisis, and
        getting the first
        impressions upon it....

    I have no doubt the deficit is
      about what Senex [Footnote: Reeve
        was at this time
        writing occasional letters in the _Times_ under the signature of
'Senex.'

    Lord Clarendon seems to have known
      this. Other correspondents did
        not; notably Lord Kingsdown,
        some of whose letters innocently comment on the opinions expressed
by Senex.] puts it at.

I read your admirable letter with great pleasure, and thought it
must be yours, though I did not understand whence it was written.

    I should very much like to
      have a talk with you. If you
    are not engaged, why
      shouldn't you and Mrs.
    and Miss Reeve come here on
      Saturday? We have asked
    Granville and C. C. G.; and I
    believe Lewis is coming.

Miladi would write to propose this to Mrs.

Reeve, but thinks she will consider two letters unnecessary.

_From Lord Brougham_

    _Cannes, December 8th_. There is a new
    complication of the American case, and
    I fear, though I don't join in what I find
    the universal feeling in England, that the
    Government of Washington will hold out. But
    even if they give in, this
    hesitation, and their manifest fear of
    the mob, is the most complete
    confirmation of all I have been so long and
    so often preaching, of the extreme
    mischief of mob-government. They are
    in the hands of the mob--and one of the worst
    mobs in the world. You see they even
    are under this dominion as to
    their military operations; for their
    disaster at Bull's Run was owing to the clamour forcing their
comrades to advance and do something; and now no one can have the
least doubt that, if Lincoln and Seward were left to themselves, a
war with England would be the thing they most dreaded; yet it is
very possible they may feel unable to resist the mob-clamour, and
may bring on that calamity.

The mob of Paris threw France into all the horrors of the reign of
terror (1793-4), which have left such indelible disgrace on the
French, and which stopped all improvement both in France and in
Europe for a quarter of a century, and which even now create such
a force in favour of despotism--as they did in the first Napoleon's
time.

    But I don't think the evils of
    mob-government--that is, of
    the supreme power being in persons
    not individually responsible--can be more clearly manifested,
though they may not lead to such atrocious crimes, than in the
States of America--and the southern as well as the northern--for
the mob governs in both.

    My opinion will be the same, even if,
    contrary to probability, the
    Washington men are stout enough
    to resist the mob; for this hesitation and this struggle against
the insanity of war could only be occasioned by the mob tyranny.

    Prince Albert died on December
    14th. It was impossible to allow
    an event so important in the
    political as well as in the social history of the reign to pass
without a notice in the 'Edinburgh Review,' and that on the earliest
occasion; though, in the middle of December, some special arrangement
had to be made for it.

    It was, in fact, brought into the
    concluding pages of the
    article on 'May's Constitutional History
    of England.'

    But the subject was one which called
    for exceeding care and delicacy in
    the handling. The services of Prince
    Albert to the Crown had been many and great; but by the country
at large they were still looked on with jealousy and suspicion.

A profound sympathy was everywhere felt for the death of the Queen's
husband; the death of a man regarded by an ignorant prejudice as
the embodiment of German influence in the Cabinet might easily be
considered as no great loss.

Reeve seems to have consulted Lord Clarendon as to how much or how
little it was prudent to say; in answer to which Lord Clarendon
wrote:-- 
_The Grove, December 31st_.

--I feel, as you do, that the events of the last month are too vast
in themselves and in their consequences for discussion by letter,
though I should much like to have a day's talk over them with you.

    I am very glad that you mean to undertake
      the task--a labour of love--of
    doing honour to the Prince, as I am sure
      it will be admirably performed; but I would suggest to you not to
be too precise as to the manner in which he exercised his political
influence....

    There is a vague belief that his influence
      was great and useful; but
    there is a very dim perception of the
      _modus operandi_....

    Peel certainly took the Prince into
      council much more than Melbourne,
    who had his own established position
      with the Queen before the Prince came to this country; but I cannot
tell you whether it was Peel who first gave him a cabinet key.

    My impression is that Lord Duncannon,
      during the short time he
    was Home Secretary, sent the Prince a
      key when the Queen was confined, and the contents of the boxes had
to be read or signed by her.

The concluding sentence in the next letter from Lord Clarendon
refers to the feeling which had been roused in Canada by the threat
of war between England and the United States.

The Canadians showed an exemplary loyalty; and great numbers of
Irish--many of whom (like O'Reilly) had been known at home as
turbulent characters--now not only pressed forward to be enrolled
in the militia, but formed themselves into special regiments.

_The Grove, January 21st_.

    --I cannot help telling you how
    excellent I think your article on
    the Prince. You have said the right
    thing in the right way, and have so hit the happy medium between
justice to him and no flattery or exaggeration, that I am sure the
article will be read with pleasure by everybody, because it exactly
reflects the public feeling.

    The Belligerent and Neutral article
    is also very good, and I expect
    that the temperate and sensible way
    in which the author recommends the abandonment of rights we can
never again exercise will have some useful results.

    The loyalty of Canada is far
    greater than I expected; but
    that the French and Irish there
    should come out so strong for the Crown against Democracy is indeed
a surprise.

    That Captain Eugene O'Reilly was a
    tremendous patriot in '48; and if
    I had not put him in prison for a
    little time to cool, he would have made a greater donkey of himself
than he did.

The next letter from Lord Clarendon relates to a point on which
widely different opinions have been and will be held, till it is
decided in the only practical way.

It would be foreign to our present purpose to argue it here; but
it is interesting to see the opinion of the man who, more distinctly
than any other, was responsible for the great change theoretically
introduced into our maritime code by the Declaration of Paris.

_The Grove, January 28th_.

    --With respect to alterations in our
    maritime law and usages, I don't
    know what Russell's opinion may be,
    but I know that Palmerston does, or did, think the time come for
relinquishing rights that we can no longer exercise.

    He readily assented to the
    doctrines laid down at Paris in
    '56, and was so entirely of
    my opinion about going further that he tried it on at Liverpool
some time afterwards; but that part of his speech was so ill received,
and he received so many remonstrances against giving up the
_palladium_, &c.

    &c., that he told me when he returned
    to London that the pear was
    not ripe, and that we must give
    public opinion a little more time to become reasonable.

On January 9th Charles Sumner had spoken at great length in the
United States Senate, proving, very much to his own satisfaction
and that of his fellow-citizens, that the surrender of Mason and
Slidell was a great moral victory, confirming the principles of
maritime law for which they had always contended, and which the
English now admitted.

    A short telegraphic summary of this
    had caught the mail at Halifax,
    and been published in the 'Times' of the
    20th; but it was not till the 27th that the United States papers,
with the full report, reached England.

Of this the 'Times'--on its own part--took no further notice; but
on February 1st it published a long and most scathing criticism of
it by 'Historicus' (Mr., now Sir, William Harcourt).

_From Lord Clarendon_ 
_The Grove, January 30th_.

    --When you can spare it, I shall be very glad
    to see Sumner's speech....
    
    Russell was, of course, guided in his despatches by the law officers,
and it is no wonder, therefore, that they should resemble the papers
that had previously appeared--many of which were written by lawyers--or
that they should be a reproduction of them; as a government could
not, without risk of failure in its peaceful object, express itself
with the vigour of Senex or the 'Edinburgh Review.'

    The most important despatch of all, however, and
    the one upon which everything hung--viz.
    the demand for reparation--was well conceived and
    executed, and did its work effectually.

    _From Lord Brougham_
      _Cannes, February 16th_.--I yesterday met
    Miss Courtenay, who gave me the very pleasing
      information that Mrs.

Austin had excellent accounts of Lady Duff Gordon, and was quite
easy about her.

I trust you will confirm this account, and also add to it a general
good account of Mrs.

    Austin herself.
    
    I hope there is a good article on the
    Amendment Cases in the 'E. R.'

    They have stupidly omitted to send
    it from Grafton Street. The
    'Quarterly' came, and a better
    article than our friend your neighbour's never was written.

    I admired it so much that I wrote
    to him about it. Pray tell him my
    opinion of it, in case my letter
    should have miscarried, and that I admired it far more than I did
the very spiteful article of someone inspired by a personal enmity
against myself, and who has not the common sense and fairness, when
relying on the wholly immaterial circumstance of my mis-stating the
day of the Westminster election (the night of Princess Charlotte's
running away), to see that Dundonald [Footnote: _Autobiography of
a Seaman_, ii. 892.

It has, however, been recently shown (Atlay's _Trial of Lord
Cochrane_, pp.
330 _et seq._) that Lord Dundonald had very little to do with it.]
makes the Duke of Sussex fall into the very same mistake.

_Cannes_ [_February_].

--I am much obliged to you for your kind letter, and rejoice to
hear of the good intelligence [Footnote: As to the health of Lady
Duff Gordon.] from the Cape which will be such a relief to my valued
friend, her mother.

The American news is a good deal more favourable, but still they
are not out of the wood, or anything like it; and, even if they
beat the Southerners in the field, the re-union is as far off as
ever.

    Their only safe course is to regard the whole
    campaign as a kind of drawn battle, and
    both sides to negotiate as to terms of
    separation.

    
    I have no doubt that a certain most
    intriguing ambassadress is at the bottom of the
    spiteful attack in the 'Quarterly,' and she will find her own
letters rise up in judgement against her.

    She never will forgive my having been at the
    dancing school with her, because that makes
    her near eighty, and she pretends only to
    be seventy-four.

    
    I am in constant expectation of a paper from a
    great mathematician, to which will be added, by
    B. Ker, artistic matter on monuments.

    It will be all sent to you, in the hope that it
    may assist whoever you have put on the monument
    question.
    

_Cannes, March 17th.

_--I am extremely sorry to find that, after all, I cannot finish
you the Cambridge article on Newton, to be used at your discretion,
or that of your contributor; for Mr.

    Routh has no less than five wranglers, including the
      senior, as his pupils, and this has entirely
    occupied him, to the exclusion of all other work. I trust
    it will not prevent the article. In truth, my discourse
      at Grantham contains all the learning on the subject, and it may
be used without any acknowledgement whatever, and I shall never
complain of the plagiarism.

    The Journal records:--
      _April 4th._--Breakfast to the Philobiblon
    at home. There came the Due d'Aumale, Van de Weyer, Milman,
    Lord Taunton.
      

    _To Mr. Dempster_
      _Exeter, April 25th_.--If that providence which
    shapes our ends will but finish those I rough-hew, I
    trust that the second week in October, or perhaps
      a few days earlier, will see us at Skibo.

We hope to start straight for the far North as soon as ever my
autumnal egg is laid....

We have hit on an Easter ramble, original and agreeable.

    I sent down my horses to my
    father's-in-law, in Dorset,
      and for the last week
    Christine and I have been riding
    gently along the coast of South
      Devon.

    Yesterday we went to see Sir John
    Coleridge's place at Ottery St.
      Mary, and he drove
    us also round the neighbourhood.
    To-day we have been at Lady Rolle's,
      at Bicton, on our way from Sidmouth, to see her gardens and
arboretum, which are really marvels of beauty and growth.

    To-morrow we shall saunter on to
    Dawlish, and so at last reach
      Plymouth, I believe. I
    want to get out of the way of the
    Exhibition opening, which bores
      me.

    At Torquay we expect to find the
    Fergusons of Raith and the Scotts
      of Ancrum.
    
    I hear that other literary
      entrepreneurs have been as much struck as I am by the power and
judgement there is in all that is written by a certain young author
of our acquaintance.

    [Footnote: See ante, vol. i. p. 374.]
    To write as well as that is a
      gift; but it is more for it
    cannot be done without infinite
    practice, labour, and good
      sense.

At Devonport they saw Mount Edgcumbe and the ironclad frigate
'Warrior' then still a novelty, and unquestionably the most powerful
ship of war afloat.

    The Journal adds: 'Back to town
    on May 3rd.'
    _From Lord Brougham_
    _Cannes, April 22nd_.

    --I have just got the new
    number, and hasten to say
    how much I am pleased with the
    only article I have had time to read with care, the Alison.

    [Footnote: 'Alison's Lives of
    Lord Castlereagh and Sir C.
    Stewart,' April 1862.]Nothing can be
    more able or more triumphant, and it is quite fair and candid
towards Castlereagh, and much more than fair towards Ch.

    Stewart, Indeed, if the letter
    to me deserves half what is
    said in its praise,[Footnote:
    _Sc_.' one of the most caustic and successful pamphlets that have
appeared in defence of an unpopular cause.'] he never could have
written it himself; and his gross stupidity in construing what I
have said of his brother, and affixing a meaning which none but
himself ever did, or could, was at the time admitted by his friends,
whom he had consulted, and in spite of whom he had published--among
others, Strangford, from whom I heard what had passed.

    I have a copy of my own, which
    I should like the author
    of the article to see, and shall
    send it through you when I return, for it is out of print.

One of the blockhead's follies was the not perceiving how great a
panegyric I had bestowed on his brother's speaking in the H. of
Commons, after fully stating its defects.

In fact, he had much greater weight as leader than Canning, who,
by the way, is too much praised in the article.

Such a book as Alison's is almost incredible for its badness of all
kinds; but the author (on p. 521, line six from foot) gives him a
pull or two as to style by 'ineligible for election'--though that
is a trifle.

    The care with which the whole subject is treated,
    and the gross errors--partly from ignorance,
    partly from adulation--exposed is quite
    admirable.

    
    I have naturally been attracted to the Monument
    article, but have not had time fully to profit
    by it; only I am greatly indebted to the learned author for what
he says of my Grantham address.

    [Footnote: 'Public Monuments,' April 1862, p. 550.]
    However, I should have been far better pleased
    had he left me out altogether, and dwelt at
    more length on the disgrace of the country never having erected a
monument to the greatest man she ever produced--indeed, the greatest
[that has] ever been.

    He seems not to be aware of the one in Westminster
    Abbey having been raised by his niece's family, and
    not by the public.
    

_Cannes, April 27th_.

--I have a complaint to make of the 'E.

    R.' last number. In the learned and able article
    on 'Jesse's Richard III.,' at p.
    307, Lingard is referred to as having quoted
    the commission of the High Constable.

    I have scanned every line and every word of
    Lingard and find no such commission.
    But in a note to the third volume of
    Hume, note R, the commission is given verbatim from Rymer.

    Jock Campbell used to hold that a false
    reference was an offence that ought to
    be made penal. I don't go so far, but
    the evil is very great.

    I have lost three or four hours in consequence.
    Therefore, pray have inquiry made of your
    contributor whether or not I am right; and if
    not, where in Lingard the quotation is.

    
    Reeve referred the 'complaint' to
    Hayward, the writer of the article, who
    replied:--

    I believe B. is right, for when I
    corrected the proof I looked in vain in Lingard,
    although I was firmly convinced that he had
    quoted the document.

But pray remind his lordship that, when Campbell spoke of a false
reference, he meant one with volume and page.

Lord Brougham's answer to this defence is not given, but it is
impossible to allow it to pass without protest; for, whatever
Campbell may have meant, it is very certain that a false reference,
with volume and page cited, by which the falsehood is at once made
manifest, is a venial offence in comparison with a false reference
given vaguely, which may keep the victim hunting for it for hours,
as this one actually did keep Lord Brougham.

    _From Lord Brougham_
    _Cannes, May 7th_.--I wish to
    suggest to you the positive duty of
    taking care that justice is done upon the trumpery, and one-sided,
and altogether insignificant Life of Pitt by Stanhope.

    Murray having published it, of
    course the 'Quarterly' has puffed
    it, and done so with an entire
    ignorance of the subject which is hardly conceivable.

    Therefore take great care before you commit
    the subject to any unsafe
    hands.
    

    _To Lord Brougham_
    _62 Rutland Gate, May 11th_.--As
    I have lived for many years on terms
    of personal friendship, and indeed intimacy, with Lord Stanhope,
and am indebted to him for many acts of kindness, it would be quite
impossible for me to attack his book, even if I thought as ill of
it as you do.

    I shall, therefore, content
    myself with recording the very
    different view which I entertain
    of the success of Mr.

    Pitt's administration. I think it
    may be shown that both in peace
    and in war he was one of the most
    unsuccessful ministers who ever exercised great power.

On these lines Reeve himself wrote the article, which was published
in the 'Review' of July, and brought him the following:--
_From Lord Stanhope_ 
Grosvenor Place, July 17th.

My dear Mr.

    Reeve,--Allow me to say how very much I
    have been gratified in reading
    the article on my 'Life of Pitt'
    in the new number of the 'Edinburgh.'

    Had the criticism been hostile I
    assure you that I should not have
    felt that I had the smallest
    reason to complain; nor should I have inquired or even wished to
know the writer's name.

    But as the matter stands, I would
    ask to convey to him through you
    my acknowledgement for his very
    indulgent appreciation of myself, as well as for the perfect
fairness and honourable candour with which the public questions at
issue between us are discussed.

    It would be a pleasure to me if
    either now or at some time
    hereafter he would permit me to
    become acquainted with the name of a critic who is evidently so
accomplished as to render the praise of no slight or mean account.

    Believe me,
    Very faithfully yours,
    STANHOPE.
    

It does not appear that Lord Stanhope ever knew who the writer was.

Meantime the Journal notes:--
This was the year of the second Great Exhibition.

    O how much wiser you would be
    To play at Indian wars with me!

HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS


    Dear Uncle Jim, this garden ground
    That now you smoke your pipe around.
    Has seen immortal actions done
    And valiant battles lost and won.

    Here we had best on tip-toe tread,
    While I for safety march ahead,
    For this is that enchanted ground
    Where all who loiter slumber sound.

    Here is the sea, here is the sand,
    Here is simple Shepherd's Land,
    Here are the fairy hollyhocks,
    And there are Ali Baba's rocks.

    But yonder, see! apart and high,
    Frozen Siberia lies; where I,
    With Robert Bruce and William Tell,
    Was bound by an enchanter's spell.

        If two may read aright
        These rhymes of old delight
        And house and garden play,
    You too, my cousins, and you only, may.

        You in a garden green
        With me were king and queen,
        Were hunter, soldier, tar,
    And all the thousand things that children are.

        Now in the elders' seat
        We rest with quiet feet,
        And from the window-bay
    We watch the children, our successors, play.

        "Time was," the golden head
        Irrevocably said;
        But time which none can bind,
    While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.

    The red room with the giant bed
    Where none but elders laid their head;
    The little room where you and I
    Did for awhile together lie
    And, simple suitor, I your hand
    In decent marriage did demand;
    The great day nursery, best of all,
    With pictures pasted on the wall
    And leaves upon the blind
    A pleasant room wherein to wake
    And hear the leafy garden shake
    And rustle in the wind--
    And pleasant there to lie in bed
    And see the pictures overhead--
    The wars about Sebastopol,
    The grinning guns along the wall,
    The daring escalade,
    The plunging ships, the bleating sheep,
    The happy children ankle-deep
    And laughing as they wade;
    All these are vanished clean away,
    And the old manse is changed to-day;
    It wears an altered face
    And shields a stranger race.
    The river, on from mill to mill,
    Flows past our childhood's garden still;
    But ah! we children never more
    Shall watch it from the water-door.
    Below the yew--it still is there--
    Our phantom voices haunt the air

    that some sale of them goes on.
    
    I am much touched by the [approaching]
    death of Coleridge, whom I
    have known so well and so
    long. I expect he will not
    survive to-day. He dined with
    us at The Club on April 24th, and
    was then very well. _Sic transit._
    
    _Foxholes, October 23rd_.

--The notices of our old friend Froude [Footnote: He died on October
20th, in his 77th year.] have been very gratifying--especially the
leader in the 'Times.'

He leaves the world quite glorified, and they now find out what a
great man he was.

                                 I wonder whether you are going to attend the funeral.

    I never send wreaths on such occasions, but if I ever did send one
    it would be now, for I am truly affected by the
    loss of such a friend. The newspapers seem to have
    discovered that there were some big men in the last generation,
and that there are very few of them in the present.

    _Rutland Gate, February 16th, 1895._--I am pretty well--not
    worse than usual; but I don't go out.
    
    My dear old friend, Lady Stanley of Alderley, died this morning.

    She was only ill four days, and expired without pain or
    suffering at eighty-seven.
    To me an irreparable loss, and to a vast circle of descendants
    and friends.

                                 [Footnote: Among Reeve's papers there are a great many letters from
Lady Stanley of Alderley, telling plainly of the long and close
friendship between the two.

    Unfortunately, there are no available letters from Reeve to her.]
    
    _To Rear-Admiral Bridge_ [Footnote: At this time Commander-in-Chief
    in Australian waters.]

    62 Rutland Gate, May 2nd.
    
    My dear admiral,--I wish you were in reach of us, to discuss the
    extraordinary events which are taking place in the North Pacific,
to which your articles on that subject have for some time pointed;
but no one foresaw the sudden uprising of Japan.

It seems to me that, in spite of her victories, Japan is in a very
critical position, politically speaking.

She lies between two huge empires, and she has undertaken to occupy
more than she can hold.

Her position is absolutely fatal to the grand design of Russia, of
crossing the north of Asia to the Pacific, and I expect Russia will
not submit to it.

    But Russia would find it extremely
    difficult to carry on military and
    naval operations at such an
    enormous distance from her base.
    I doubt whether she could
    destroy the Japanese fleet,
    and it certainly is not for our
    interest that it should be
    destroyed. The disposition here
    is to observe strict neutrality
    and watch the course of events.
    
    It is curious that nobody points
    out that the United States are
    the country with the largest
    future interest in the Pacific, and that they must have a voice
in this controversy.

It also largely affects our own Australian colonies.

  A Russian establishment
    in Corea would effect a momentous
    change in the Pacific, and Japan will doubtless resist it to the
uttermost.

  We are very dull here.
    Lord Rosebery has
    sunk into complete insignificance, and his state of health is
doubtful.

  The Government is rotten,
    but continues to
    hold together.

  I think
    something must
    occur before long to stir the waters.

  We are going to
    Foxholes on May 20th to
    stay there.

  I have spent a
    dreary winter, being
    unable to go out, but I am not seriously ill--suffering chiefly
from old age.

  Mrs. Reeve sends you her
    kind regards, and I am
    always

  Yours very
    faithfully,
    H. REEVE.
