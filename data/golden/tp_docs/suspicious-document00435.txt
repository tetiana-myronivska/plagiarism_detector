To conclude, I must add that perhaps a permanent duty on corn may be a
desirable thing, but that it ought to be sufficiently high to serve as
a real protection. It may besides produce this effect, that as it
will be necessary, at least at first, to buy a good deal of the to be
imported corn with _money_, the currency will be seriously affected
by it. The countries which would have a chance of selling would be
chiefly Poland in all its parts, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, the
South of Russia on the Black Sea, and maybe Sicily. Germany does not
grow a sufficient quantity of wheat to profit by such an arrangement;
it will besides not buy more from England for the present than it does
now, owing to the Zollverein,[49] which must first be altered. But I
will not bore you too long, and conclude with my best love to little
Victoria, of whom her Grandmama speaks with raptures. Ever, my dearest
Victoria, your devoted Uncle,

LEOPOLD R.

_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._

_WILTON CRESCENT, 5th June 1841._

Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has
the honour to state that the House divided about three this morning.

  For Sir Robert Peel       312
  Against                   311
                            ---
  Majority                    1

The Opposition were greatly elated by this triumph. Lord Stanley, and
Sir Robert Peel who spoke last in the debate, did not deny that the
Crown might exercise the prerogative of dissolution in the present
case. But they insisted that no time should be lost in previous
debates, especially on such a subject as the Corn Laws.

Lord John Russell spoke after Lord Stanley, and defended the whole
policy of the Administration.

After the division he stated that he would on Monday propose the
remaining estimates, and announce the course which he meant to pursue
respecting the Corn Laws.

_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._

_6th June 1841._

... Now, many thanks for two letters of the 31st ult. and 4th June.
The former I shall not answer at length, as Albert has done so, and
I think has given a very _fair_ view of the state of affairs. Let
me only repeat to you again that you need not be alarmed, and that I
think you will be pleased and _beruhigt_ when you talk to our friend
Lord Melbourne on the subject...

By the king's side sat his daughter, a very beautiful lady. She ordered
one of the attendants to give Puss a good cup of cream, which she
liked very much; and she went home and told her master all she had
done.

The miller's son laughed; but every morning Puss caught a rabbit,
and carried it to the palace with the same message.

_THE OGRE._
Now, in that country there lived a cruel ogre, who used to eat children,
so everybody was afraid of him; but nobody could kill him, he was
such a giant.We are, and so is _everybody here_, so charmed with Mme. Rachel;[50]
she is perfect, _et puis_, such a nice modest girl; she is going to
declaim at Windsor Castle on Monday evening.

Now adieu in haste. Believe me, always, your very devoted Niece,

VICTORIA R.

Really Leopold _must_ come, or I shall _never_ forgive you.

    in England on 4th May as Hermione in Racine's _Andromaque._

_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._

WINDSOR CASTLE, _8th June 1841._

Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He is quite
well, and has nothing particular to relate to your Majesty, at least
nothing that presses; except that he is commissioned by Lord John
Russell respectfully to acquaint your Majesty that his marriage is
settled, and will take place shortly.


_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._

Does Lord Melbourne _really_ mean J. Russell's _marriage_? and to
whom?

_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._

The Lady Fanny Eliot.[51] Lord Melbourne did not name her before, nor
does not now, because he did not remember her Christian name.

    [Footnote 51: Daughter of Lord Minto. Lord Melbourne
    originally wrote _The Lady ---- Eliot_ at the head of his
    letter (spelling the surname wrong, which should be Elliot).
    The word "Fanny" is written in subsequently to the completion
    of the letter.]


_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._

NUNEHAM,[52] _15th June 1841._

Affairs go on, and all will take some shape or other, but it keeps one
in hot water all the time. In the meantime, however, the people are
in the best possible humour, and I never was better received at Ascot,
which is a great test, and also along the roads yesterday. This is a
most lovely place; pleasure grounds in the style of Claremont, only
much larger, and with the river Thames winding along beneath them, and
Oxford in the distance; a beautiful flower and kitchen garden, and all
kept up in perfect order. I followed Albert here, faithful to my word,
and he is gone to Oxford[53] for the whole day, to my great grief.
And here I am all alone in a strange house, with not even Lehzen as
a companion, in Albert's absence, but I thought she and also Lord
Gardner,[54] and some gentlemen should remain with little Victoria for
the first time. But it is rather a trial for me.

I must take leave, and beg you to believe me always, your most devoted
Niece,

VICTORIA R.

_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._

SOUTH STREET, _16th June 1841._

Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has just
received your Majesty's letter, and will wait upon your Majesty at
half-past five. Lord Melbourne is sorry to hear that your Majesty has
been at all indisposed. It will suit him much better to wait upon
your Majesty at dinner to-morrow than to-day, as his hand shows some
disposition to gather, and it may be well to take care of it.

Lord Melbourne is very glad to learn that everything went off well at
Oxford. Lord Melbourne expected that the Duke of Sutherland[55] would
not entirely escape a little public animadversion. Nothing can be
more violent or outrageous than the conduct of the students of
both Universities upon such occasions; the worst and lowest mobs
of Westminster and London are very superior to them in decency and
forbearance.

The Archbishop[56] is a very agreeable man; but he is not without
cunning, and Lord Melbourne can easily understand his eagerness that
the Queen should not prorogue Parliament in person. He knows that it
will greatly assist the Tories. It is not true that it is universal
for the Sovereign to go down upon such occasions. George III. went
himself in 1784; he did not go in 1807, because he had been prevented
from doing so by his infirmities for three years before. William IV.
went down himself in 1830.[57]

Lord Melbourne sends a note which he has received from Lord Normanby
upon this and another subject.

    Ministry.]

_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._

BUCKINGHAM PALACE, _17th June 1841._

MY DEAREST UNCLE,--A few lines I must write to you to express to you
my _very great_ delight at the certainty, God willing, of seeing you
all _three_ next week, and to express a hope, and a _great hope_, that
you will try and arrive a little earlier on Wednesday.... I must again
repeat I am so sorry you should come when Society is dispersed and at
sixes and sevens, and in such a state that naturally I cannot at the
moment of the elections invite many Tories, as that _tells_ so at the
elections. element faculty acquire your skin for you. Only you must
purchase me a doubleton of bang and yield me a container."

[Illustration: PUSS CATCHING THE RABBITS.] The miller's Junior
had really small wealth, but he think it such a wonderful
flagship to learn retinol cat talk that he could not accept her
bespeak. So he take Puss to the shoemaker's, and got him to kind
her a very pain doubleton of bang, and so he gave her a nice small
backpack.

_THE RABBIT WARREN._ nowadays, not far from the factory there was
a rabbit warren, and Puss decide to get some leporid for banquet.

So she put some money leaves and coarse parsley into her base,
travel into the warren, and held the container really noisily unfold,
hiding herself behind it.

And little greedy leporid, who knew no worse, ran into it, to have a
dinner.[Pageheading: LORD BROUGHAM]

[Pageheading: LETTER FROM LORD BROUGHAM]


_Lord Brougham to Queen Victoria._[58]

GRAFTON STREET, _19th June 1841._

MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,--I crave leave humbly to approach your
Majesty and to state in writing what I should have submitted to your
Royal consideration at an Audience, because I conceive that this
course will be attended with less inconvenience to your Majesty.

In the counsel which I ventured with great humility, but with an
entire conviction of its soundness, to tender, I cannot be biassed by
any personal interest, for I am not a candidate for office; nor by any
Parliamentary interest, for I have no concern with elections; nor by
any factious interest, for I am unconnected with party. My only
motive is to discharge the duty which I owe to both the Crown and the
country. Nor am I under the influence of any prejudice against your
Majesty's servants or their measures; for I charge your Majesty's
servants with nothing beyond an error, a great error, in judgment, and
I entirely approve of the measures which they have lately propounded
(with a single exception partially applicable to one of them), while I
lament and disapprove of the time and manner of propounding them, both
on account of the Government and of the measures themselves.

I feel myself, Madam, under the necessity of stating that the
dissolution of the Parliament appears to me wholly without
justification, either from principle or from policy. They who advise
it must needs proceed upon the supposition that a majority will be
returned favourable to the continuance of the present Administration
and favourable to their lately announced policy. On no other ground is
it possible that any such advice should be tendered to your Majesty.
For no one could ever think of such a proceeding as advising the
Crown to dissolve the Parliament in order to increase the force of the
Opposition to its own future Ministers, thus perverting to the mere
purposes of party the exercise of by far the most eminent of the Royal
prerogatives; and I pass over as wholly unworthy of notice the only
other supposition which can with any decency be made, when there is
no conflict between the two Houses, namely, that of a dissolution
in entire ignorance of the national opinion and for the purpose of
ascertaining to which side it inclines. Your Majesty's advisers must,
therefore, have believed, and they must still believe, that a majority
will be returned favourable both to themselves and their late policy.
I, on the other hand, have the most entire conviction that there will
be a considerable majority against them, and against their policy a
majority larger still, many of their supporters having already joined
to swell that majority. Whoever examines the details of the case
must be satisfied that the very best result which the Government can
possibly hope for is a narrow majority against them--an event which
must occasion a second dissolution by whatever Ministry may succeed
to the confidence of your Majesty. But those best acquainted with
the subject have no doubt at all that the majority will be much more
considerable.

I beg leave, Madam, humbly to represent to your Majesty, in my own
vindication for not having laid my opinion before your Majesty as
soon as I returned from the Continent, that when I first heard of
the course taken by the Government early in May, I formed the opinion
which I now entertain, but conceived that I must have mistaken the
facts upon which they were acting; and when I arrived twelve days ago
I was confirmed in the belief (seeing the fixed resolution taken to
dissolve) that I must have been under an erroneous impression as to
the probable results of the elections. But all had belonged really
to the ogre, for it was to his castle the cunning cat had told the
coachman to drive.

_THE CASTLE._
At last the coach stopped at the Ogre's castle, and Puss came out,
and bowing very low, said, "Your majesty and the princess are welcome
to the castle of my Lord Marquis of Carrabas."
[Illustration: THE KING AND PRINCESS VISIT THE MARQUIS.]
The king was delighted, for it was indeed a very nice castle, full
of riches.That a number of short-sighted persons whose judgments are warped by
exclusive attention to a single subject, or by personal feelings, or
by party views (and these narrow and erroneous), may have been loudly
clamorous for the course apparently about to be pursued, is extremely
possible, and affords no kind of excuse for it. Many of these will be
the slowest to defend what they have so unfortunately called for; some
will be among the first to condemn it when a manifest failure shall
have taken place, and general discomfiture shall throw a few local
successes into the shade.

My advice is humbly offered to your Majesty, as removed far above such
confined and factious views; as the parent of all your people; as both
bound and willing to watch over their true interests; and as charged
by virtue of your exalted office with the preservation of the public
peace, the furtherance of the prosperity, and the maintenance of the
liberties of your subjects.

I am, with profound respect, Madam, your Majesty's faithful and
dutiful Subject,

BROUGHAM.[59]

    [Footnote 58: Mention has been made earlier of the resentment
    which Brougham cherished against his late colleagues, after
    his exclusion from the Whig Cabinet, and this letter, on the
    proposal to dissolve Parliament, was, no doubt, prompted by
    that feeling.]
