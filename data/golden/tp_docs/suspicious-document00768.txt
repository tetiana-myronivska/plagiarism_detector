Mr. Gryce's interest in Americana had not originated with himself: it was
impossible to think of him as evolving any taste of his own. Flourens,
Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences.

Professor Kolliker's critical essay 'Upon the Darwinian Theory' is, like
all that proceeds from the pen of that thoughtful and accomplished
writer, worthy of the most careful consideration. It comprises a
brief but clear sketch of Darwin's views, followed by an enumeration
of the leading difficulties in the way of their acceptance;
difficulties which would appear to be insurmountable to Professor
Kolliker, inasmuch as he proposes to replace Mr.Anxious as he was to avoid personal
notice, he took, in the printed mention of his name, a pleasure so
exquisite and excessive that it seemed a compensation for his shrinking
from publicity.

To enjoy the sensation as often as possible, he subscribed to all the
reviews dealing with book-collecting in general, and American history in
particular, and as allusions to his library abounded in the pages of
these journals, which formed his only reading, he came to regard himself
as figuring prominently in the public eye, and to enjoy the thought of
the interest which would be excited if the persons he met in the street,
or sat among in travelling, were suddenly to be told that he was the
possessor of the Gryce Americana.

The whole conception of the imperfection of organisms and the
necessity of their becoming perfected is plainly the weakest
side of Darwin's Theory, and a 'pis aller' (Nothbehelf) because Darwin
could think of no other principle by which to explain the metamorphoses
which, as I also believe, have occurred."
Here again we must venture to dissent completely from Professor Kolliker's
conception of Mr. Darwin's hypothesis. It appears to us to be one
of the many peculiar merits of that hypothesis that it involves no belief
in a necessary and continual progress of organisms.

Again, Mr. Darwin, if we read him aright, assumes no special tendency of
organisms to give rise to useful varieties, and knows nothing of needs
of development, or necessity of perfection. What he says is, in
substance: All organisms vary. It is in the highest degree improbable
that any given variety should have exactly the same relations to surrounding
conditions as the parent stock. In that case it is either better fitted
(when the variation may be called useful), or worse fitted, to cope
with them. If better, it will tend to supplant the parent stock; if
worse, it will tend to be extinguished by the parent stock.

If (as is hardly conceivable) the new variety is so perfectly adapted to
the conditions that no improvement upon it is possible,--it will
persist, because, though it does not cease to vary, the varieties will
be inferior to itself.

If, as is more probable, the new variety is by no means perfectly adapted
to its conditions, but only fairly well adapted to them, it will persist,
so long as none of the varieties which it throws off are better adapted
than itself.
On the other hand, as soon as it varies in a useful way, i.e. when
the variation is such as to adapt it more perfectly to its conditions,
the fresh variety will tend to supplant the former.
So far from a gradual progress towards perfection forming any
necessary part of the Darwinian creed, it appears to us that it is
perfectly consistent with indefinite persistence in one estate, or
with a gradual retrogression.Once, however, she had had a special edition of the Sarum
Rule printed in rubric and presented to every clergyman in the diocese;
and the gilt album in which their letters of thanks were pasted formed
the chief ornament of her drawing-room table.

For the teleological evidence tally therefore: an harmonium or system(
A) is exactly suit to perform nucleotide map or goal( choline); hence
it was specially constructed to perform that utility. In Paley's famous
artwork, the adaptation of all the portion of the ticker to the utility,
or purpose, of demo the day, is keep to be evidence that the ticker was
particularly plan to that bitthead; on the land, that the only cause
we cognize of, competent to make such an phenomenon as a timepiece
which shall lose clip, is a plan brain adapting the dint straight to that
bitthead. Suppose, nevertheless, that any one had been able to demo
that the timepiece had not been made directly by any individual, but
that it was the offspring of the alteration of another timepiece which
keep time but poorly; and that this again had continue from a artifact
which could barely be name a ticker at all--seeing that it had no
person on the dial and the complement were rudimentary; and that going
rearward and ahead in day we come at last to a revolving tube as the
earliest traceable fundamentals of the fractional cloth. And ideate
that it had been potential to entertainment that all these
acceleration had resulted, first, from a attitude of the construction
to vary indefinitely; and secondly, from something in the surrounding
world which helped all change in the way of an accurate time-keeper,
and checked all those in same way; then it is obvious that the
pressure of Paley's argument would be gone.

For it would be show that an aerator exhaustively ill adapted to a
particular goal might be the phenomenon of a pedagogics of assay and mistake
act by unintelligent vasoconstrictor, as ill as of the retrograde use
of the dint appropriate to that beginning, by an intelligent vasoconstrictor.
nowadays it appears to America that what we have hither, for exemplification's
behalf, supposed to be done with the watch, is precisely what the
establishment of Darwin's explanation will do for the organic class.

For the idea that every benthos has been created as it is and establish
directly at a intent, Mr. Darwin substitutes the construct of something
which may fairly be termed a method of trial and blot. system change
incessantly; of these fluctuation the few encounter with surrounding
sunshine which accommodate them and thrive; the many are unsuited and
become extinguished.

According to Teleology, each system is like a firearm bullet fired straight
at a mark; according to Darwin, system are like grapeshot of which
one safety something and the leftover season broad. For the teleologist
an being be because it was make for the sunshine in which it is
found; for the Darwinian an benthos exists because, out of many of
its sort, it is the only one which has been able to persist in the
sunshine in which it is establish.

Teleology implies that the organs of every organism are perfect and
cannot be better; the Darwinian reductionism merely affirms that they
idle good plenty to disable the organism to embrace its own against
such competitors as it has meet with, but acknowledge the expectation of
indefinite betterment

She was smaller and thinner than Lily Bart, with a restless pliability of
pose, as if she could have been crumpled up and run through a ring, like
the sinuous draperies she affected. Her small pale face seemed the mere
setting of a pair of dark exaggerated eyes, of which the visionary gaze
contrasted curiously with her self-assertive tone and gestures; so that,
as one of her friends observed, she was like a disembodied spirit who
took up a great deal of room.

Darwinism affirms on the contrary, that there was no express construction
concerned in the matter; but that among the multitudinous variations of
the Feline stock, many of which died out from want of power to resist
opposing influences, some, the cats, were better fitted to catch mice
than others, whence they throve and persisted, in proportion to the
advantage over their fellows thus offered to them.

Far from imagining that cats exist 'in order' to catch mice well, Darwinism
supposes that cats exist 'because' they catch mice well--mousing
being not the end, but the condition, of their existence.

And if the cat type has long persisted as we know it, the interpretation
of the fact upon Darwinian principles would be, not that the cats
have remained invariable, but that such varieties as have incessantly
occurred have been, on the whole, less fitted to get on in the world
than the existing stock.

If we apprehend the spirit of the 'Origin of Species' rightly, then, nothing
can be more entirely and absolutely opposed to Teleology, as it
is commonly understood, than the Darwinian Theory.

So far from being a "Teleologist in the fullest sense of the word,"
we would deny that he is a Teleologist in the ordinary sense at all; and
we should say that, apart from his merits as a naturalist, he has
rendered a most remarkable service to philosophical thought by
enabling the student of Nature to recognise, to their fullest extent,
those adaptations to purpose which are so striking in the organic
world, and which Teleology has done good service in keeping before
our minds, without being false to the fundamental principles of a
scientific conception of the universe.

The apparently diverging teachings of the Teleologist and of the Morphologist
are reconciled by the Darwinian hypothesis.

But leaving our own impressions of the 'Origin of Species,' and turning
to those passages especially cited by Professor Kolliker, we cannot
admit that they bear the interpretation he puts upon them.

Darwin, if we read him rightly, does 'not' affirm that every detail in
the structure of an animal has been created for its benefit. His words
are (p. 199):--
"The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately
made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that
every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its
possessor.

They believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the
eyes of man, or for mere variety. This doctrine, if true, would be absolutely
fatal to my theory--yet I fully admit that many structures are of no
direct use to their possessor."
And after sundry illustrations and qualifications, he concludes (p.
200):--

"Hence every detail of structure in every living creature (making some
little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions) may
be viewed either as having been of special use to some ancestral form,
or as being now of special use to the descendants of this form--either
directly, or indirectly, through the complex laws of growth."
But it is one thing to say, Darwinically, that every detail observed
in an animal's structure is of use to it, or has been of use to
its ancestors; and quite another to affirm, teleologically, that
every detail of an animal's structure has been created for its
benefit.

On the former hypothesis, for example, the teeth of the foetal Balaena
have a meaning; on the latter, none. So far as we are aware, there
is not a phrase in the 'Origin of Species', inconsistent with Professor
Kolliker's position, that "varieties arise irrespectively of the notion
of purpose, or of utility, according to general laws of Nature, and may
be either useful, or hurtful, or indifferent."
On the contrary, Mr. Darwin writes (Summary of Chap. V.):--
"Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one case out
of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part
varies more or less from the same part in the parents.... The external
conditions of life, as climate and food, etc., seem to have induced some
slight modifications. Habit, in producing constitutional differences, and
use, in strengthening, and disuse, in weakening and diminishing organs,
seem to have been more potent in their effects."
But the luxury of others was not
what she wanted. A few years ago it had sufficed her: she had taken her
daily meed of pleasure without caring who provided it. Now she was
beginning to chafe at the obligations it imposed, to feel herself a mere
pensioner on the splendour which had once seemed to belong to her.  There
were even moments when she was conscious of having to pay her way.

For a long time she had refused to play bridge. She knew she could not
afford it, and she was afraid of acquiring so expensive a taste. She had
seen the danger exemplified in more than one of her associates--in young
Ned Silverton, for instance, the charming fair boy now seated in abject
rapture at the elbow of Mrs. Fisher, a striking divorcee with eyes and
gowns as emphatic as the head-lines of her "case." Lily could remember
when young Silverton had stumbled into their circle, with the air of a
strayed Arcadian who has published chamung [Updater's note: charming?]
sonnets in his college journal. Since then he had developed a taste for
Mrs. Fisher and bridge, and the latter at least had involved him in
expenses from which he had been more than once rescued by harassed maiden
sisters, who treasured the sonnets, and went without sugar in their tea
to keep their darling afloat. For what are the phenomena of Agamogenesis,

O solidite de l'esprit Francais, que devenez-vous?"
M. Flourens has, in fact, utterly failed to comprehend the first principles
of the doctrine which he assails so rudely. His objections to details
are of the old sort, so battered and hackneyed on this side of the
Channel, that not even a Quarterly Reviewer could be induced to
pick them up for the purpose of pelting Mr.

Darwin over again. We have Cuvier and the mummies; M. Roulin and the
domesticated animals of America; the difficulties presented by hybridism
and by Palaeontology; Darwinism a 'rifacciamento' of De Maillet
and Lamarck; Darwinism a system without a commencement, and its
author bound to believe in M.

Pouchet, etc. etc.
How one knows it all by heart, and with what relief one reads at p.
65--

"Je laisse M. Darwin!"
But we cannot leave M. Flourens without calling our readers' attention
to his wonderful tenth chapter, "De la Preexistence des Germes et de
l'Epigenese," which opens thus:--

"Spontaneous generation is only a chimaera.

This point established, two hypotheses remain: that of 'pre-existence'
and that of 'epigenesis'.
The one of these hypotheses has as little foundation as the other."
(P.

163.)
"The doctrine of 'epigenesis' is derived from Harvey: following by
ocular inspection the development of the new being in the Windsor
does, he saw each part appear successively, and taking the moment of
'appearance' for the moment of 'formation' he imagined 'epigenesis'."
(P. 165.)
On the contrary, says M. Flourens (p. 167),
"The new being is formed at a stroke ('tout d'un coup') as a whole,
instantaneously; it is not formed part by part, and at different
times.

It is formed at once at the single 'individual' moment at which the
conjunction of the male and female elements takes place."
It will be observed that M. Flourens uses language which cannot be
mistaken. For him, the labours of von Baer, of Rathke, of Coste,
and their contemporaries and successors in Germany, France, and
England, are non-existent: and, as Darwin "imagina" natural selection,
so Harvey "imagina" that doctrine which gives him an even greater
claim to the veneration of posterity than his better known discovery
of the circulation of the blood.A house in which no one ever dined at home unless there was "company"; a
door-bell perpetually ringing; a hall-table showered with square
envelopes which were opened in haste, and oblong envelopes which were
allowed to gather dust in the depths of a bronze jar; a series of French
and English maids giving warning amid a chaos of hurriedly-ransacked
wardrobes and dress-closets; an equally changing dynasty of nurses and
footmen; quarrels in the pantry, the kitchen and the drawing-room;
precipitate trips to Europe, and returns with gorged trunks and days of
interminable unpacking; semi-annual discussions as to where the summer
should be spent, grey interludes of economy and brilliant reactions of
expense--such was the setting of Lily Bart's first memories.

Ruling the turbulent element called home was the vigorous and determined
figure of a mother still young enough to dance her ball-dresses to rags,
while the hazy outline of a neutral-tinted father filled an intermediate
space between the butler and the man who came to wind the clocks. And this
is no doubt true, but it by no means follows that the particular order
and harmony observed among them should be that which we see. Surely
the stripes of dun horses, and the teeth of the foetal 'Balaena', are
not explained by the "existence of general laws of Nature." Mr. Darwin
endeavours to explain the exact order of organic nature which
exists; not the mere fact that there is some order.

And with regard to the existence of a natural system of minerals; the
obvious reply is that there may be a natural classification of any
objects--of stones on a sea-beach, or of works of art; a natural
classification being simply an assemblage of objects in groups, so as to
express their most important and fundamental resemblances and differences.
No doubt Mr. Darwin believes that those resemblances and differences upon
which our natural systems or classifications of animals and plants are
based, are resemblances and differences which have been produced genetically,
but we can discover no reason for supposing that he denies the existence
of natural classifications of other kinds.

And, after all, is it quite so certain that a genetic relation may
not underlie the classification of minerals? The inorganic world has not
always been what we see it. It has certainly had its metamorphoses,
and, very probably, a long "Entwickelungsgeschichte" out of a nebular
blastema. Who knows how far that amount of likeness among sets of
minerals, in virtue of which they are now grouped into families
and orders, may not be the expression of the common conditions to
which that particular patch of nebulous fog, which may have been
constituted by their atoms, and of which they may be, in the strictest
sense, the descendants, was subjected?

It will be obvious from what has preceded, that we do not agree with Professor
Kolliker in thinking the objections which he brings forward so weighty
as to be fatal to Darwin's view. But even if the case were otherwise, we
should be unable to accept the "Theory of Heterogeneous Generation"
which is offered as a substitute. That theory is thus stated:--
"The fundamental conception of this hypothesis is, that, under the
influence of a general law of development, the germs of organisms
produce others different from themselves. This might happen (1) by the
fecundated ova passing, in the course of their development, under particular
circumstances, into higher forms; (2) by the primitive and later
organisms producing other organisms without fecundation, out of
germs or eggs (Parthenogenesis)."

In favour of this hypothesis, Professor Kolliker adduces the well-known
facts of Agamogenesis, or "alternate generation"; the extreme dissimilarity
of the males and females of many animals; and of the males, females, and
neuters of those insects which live in colonies: and he defines its relations
to the Darwinian theory as follows:--
"It is obvious that my hypothesis is apparently very similar to
Darwin's, inasmuch as I also consider that the various forms of
animals have proceeded directly from one another.

My hypothesis of the creation of organisms by heterogeneous
generation, however, is distinguished very essentially from Darwin's by
the entire absence of the principle of useful variations and their natural
selection: and my fundamental conception is this, that a great
plan of development lies at the foundation of the origin of the whole
organic world, impelling the simpler forms to more and more complex
developments. How this law operates, what influences determine the
development of the eggs and germs, and impel them to assume constantly
new forms, I naturally cannot pretend to say; but I can at least adduce
the great analogy of the alternation of generations. If a 'Bipinnaria', a
'Brachialaria', a 'Pluteus', is competent to produce the Echinoderm, which
is so widely different from it; if a hydroid polype can produce
the higher Medusa; if the vermiform Trematode 'nurse' can develop
within itself the very unlike 'Cercaria', it will not appear
impossible that the egg, or ciliated embryo, of a sponge, for once,
under special conditions, might become a hydroid polype, or the
embryo of a Medusa, an Echinoderm."

She and her mother had been seated at the luncheon-table, over the
CHAUFROIX and cold salmon of the previous night's dinner: it was one of
Mrs. Bart's few economies to consume in private the expensive remnants of
her hospitality. Lily was feeling the pleasant languor which is youth's
penalty for dancing till dawn; but her mother, in spite of a few lines
about the mouth, and under the yellow waves on her temples, was as alert,
determined and high in colour as if she had risen from an untroubled
sleep.
