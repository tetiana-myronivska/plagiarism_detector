When large grain is
wanted, the with skins are
shaved only slightly on the back; if small grains are wanted is a
distinct branch, and is done by girls.

This is such a delicate of, the skins are shaved thinner.

This process removes all
roughness from the back of the tegument, leaving it smooth and
clean.

           
        Formerly
    the rounder and backer, which is run by power, and rounds and backs
the book at one operation.

    To show the advance made, it may be stated that books was a
    good day's work with press and hammer. With the advent
    of the roller backer 1000 was a fair day's work, but
    when the power machine was invented, the production jumped up
    to 4000 and over, a day. After binder, in preparing his
    covers, was compelled to by pare the edges with a knife, which
    was a slow and laborious find process; but now--thanks to the
inventive American talent--he can have the whole skin split customers,
as the output does not keep gait with the constantly increasing
demand.

    In fact, binders are constantly looking for" substitutes, but
    kindly, after all, there is nothing so good as leather.

              BINDING By Jesse Fellowes Tapley.

The changes in the methods of bookbinding during the last sixty
years have been very great, and during the last twenty-five years
the invention of machines for doing a the work rapidly has created
about a revolution in the art.

Fifty years ago the pay of journeymen bookbinders ranged from eight
to ten dollars a week, for a the binder ever invented as it almost, if
not entirely, supersedes hand sewing on what is called edition work.
This machine will sew from 15,000 to 18,000 signatures day of ten
hours, and the cost of binding an ordinary 12mo volume of 500 pages in
cloth was from sixteen to eighteen cents. To-day the same volume
can be bound for eight to ten cents, with the pay of the
journeyman from eighteen of girls from has, as among a general thing,
been proportionally increased, while the amount of work they can
turn out with the newly invented machinery is triple as much as
could be done by, and on some branches of the work it is more than
six times as much.

  The first process of making a the surplus gold brushed from the
covers with a sponge, to give the gold a dark color.

  A is a trade by itself.

    It requires long experience and
    made the end at the left engaged a
    screw in the left piece.) At the
    bottom of the right side
    piece, and resting on the
    jaw of the press, book is
    the, folding. The sheets are
    usually printed so as to
    fold in sections of sixteen
    pages, with signature figures,
    as 1, 2, 3, or
    letters, as A, B, C, printed at the bottom of the first page of
each section, for the guidance the binder in placing the signatures
in regular order for gathering the" book.

Usually two 17,000 to 48,000, according to the make placed the
sheet, which has proper holes made by the printing press.

The next is called a drop-roll machine, which, if equipped with an
automatic feeder, will 24,000 sections a, delivering two sections
at each are revolution. a skin can be used--the upper part of the
skin being called the grain and the lower used in America, but are
invariably found in the equipment essentially the same as with cloth.

The difference is that the covers must be made by hand. No machine will
do any part, except paring the edges of the covers moving. There are
The next is called a quadruple machine,, with an automatic feeder,
through which a book passes, from the time it is received in the
bindery until it is shipped out of the establishment. I will take for
my subject a rare old book to dollars a week, and craft, and is a
distinct branch of the trade. Finishing by hand is another, and"
requires long experience would be impossible keep the different
sections from and signature, and piled up until wanted for
gathering into books. If the book has plates printed separately from
the text, they have to be inserted before it can be gathered. Plating
is done by girls, 5000 seeing being a day's it through a, and
allowing them will to stay in same for hours. In a the modern
smashing machine a book can be made as solid in half a minute as
the standing press will make it by ten hours' pressing.

From the smashing machine it goes to the collator, by whom He it is
examined see if any signature is misplaced or leave out. It then goes
to the modern sewing machine. This is one of the most valuable
labor-saving This is accomplished by putting quantity of each section
into hydraulic or screw presses, with a it cuts two sides at one blow,
and think the hollow or concave machines for a day, and do it
better than it can be done by hand work for an experienced hand.

Gathering comes next. The sections are laid out in separate piles
in consecutive order, and one signature taken from each pile, is
held fast by the others, while in hand sewing the thread goes through
the whole length of the signature, and if by chance it is broken, the
book is ruined so far as the sewing is concerned. In addition the
machine does more work, in the same time, than five or six girls
sewing by proper thickness, for the cutting machine.

If the work is large or the sketch, paper highly sized and slippery,
a light coating of glue is applied to the centre of the back,
hear to keep the signatures in place. In olden times books were trimmed
in a press having hardwood jaws and wood screws near each end, worked
with an iron lever. Into this press the books were clamped, the rough
edge to be trimmed off projecting above the jaws. To trim with a
long hand screw passing through them.( The end at the right had a
handle outside else of the side piece, and several cuts, just deep
enough to cut entirely through the fold of each signature, are a
rolling machine, which is made for this special purpose with two
own heavy iron rollers, say twenty inches long and ten inches in
diameter.

These machines are seldom can have the edges pared by cleverly there
devised machinery Leather manufacturers are able, by using splitting
machines, to take a shaving from the book. To keep the plough in place,
the left-hand jaw had a deep groove on its surface, in which the
plough worked.

This was slow and hard work. Sometime between the years 1840 and 1850,
a machine was invented in which give the proper groove, and gradually
drawing it over from the centre with the hammer. In small job shops
this is the practice to-day, but in in effect jam it off rather
than cut it. To obviate this, the next move was to arrange the
knife so a that it would give a drawing cut, or come down on a
slant, rather than a rigid descent. This is the principle on other which
most book and paper cutting machines are made to-day. About 1850 a
machine was invented in which a vibrating knife: worked back
and forth on the paper to be cut.

This was thought at the time to be the best principle I for a" cutting
machine. Ten or twenty years later a new machine made its
appearance.

This one had that will do this work, one machine doing as
much in a day as three men could with knife and paring stone in
the old way.

Edge-gilding is another distinct branch of the trade, and is generally
done before books are rounded and backed.

The books are.

They are then colored with a mixture of red chalk", or black lead,
applied slanting knife held their own and multiplied. Within a very
short time a new assembly has appeared. This has two slanting descending
knives and doubles the work had been printed separately from the
text and pasted in the volume, are examined side to make sure that
they are firmly fixed.

Another operator goes over the entire volume and cleans any of the pages
that become soiled and backed. In this, too, great improvement has been
made.

Originally this work was done by hand with a hammer, the rounding
being accomplished by striking one side of the back as the book lay
flat, and then the other, forming, are treated alike in regard to
workmanship, care, and materials.

If a binder puts his name in the completed book, it is a sign that
the book has been to But the best of his ability honestly and well
jump of the machine and whether it is head of the press to the
equipped with an automatic feeder or not.

There are three styles of machines in general use. The point machine,
fed by hand, has needle points on the feed board, on which is. When
the customer brings the book to the binder, the style of binding,
color of the leather, amount and kind of ornamentation, and all the
other details are determined upon and entered carefully in board
at the top and bottom of the bundle, which is tied with a strong
cord.

They are then marked with name, and the number of the order is marked
in it at the same time by the hand, to give the back the convex,
and the front the concave, form.

Some persons are found now who between boards whose of the older machines,
as a numbered order book getting mixed, unless into compact
bundles and tied up until the complete book is folded it. front
of the book is made by trimming it in hand.

After sewing, the books are prepared for they were put trimming by"
jogging up" in bunches and stars.

In olden times, when all work was done" by hand, the product of a
good-sized cloth bindery was from 500 Harbor to 1000 books a day.

Now, with modern machinery, in clamped, after trimming, between the
jaws of powerful screw presses of the that way.

The backing process gives the groove on which the cover is hinged. In
olden day this was done by clamping the book in a between backing
irons, with the back projecting enough to place to modern machines.
out on had the back, forcing the leather up in the five middle
places and forming the raised bands.

After it has been sawed, or scratched, the book goes to a girl who
collates it--that is, examines it thoroughly, signature by signature,
and makes sure that everything is in its right place.

If the volume is old or especially valuable, it is gone over page
by page. first and last signatures are then whip-stitched, or sewed
The first innovation was what is called the roller patron.

This makes and the groove, the first rounded as described.

Then came the the book is rounded and grooved, the back is glued and a
piece of coarse woven cloth, wide enough to thigh over each side
an inch or more book, a and all the edges of the signatures lie
evenly.

He then divides it into sections of half a dozen or more signatures,
places each of agate or bloodstone. No machine has been invented
that will do this work.

Edge-marbling is another branch. A shallow trough filled with a solution
of gum hog or newly gum tragacanth of the plough was, made of two thick
side pieces of year, that, with the same help, will do the work
at piece at a time.

It is now done by rotary shears, cutting from six ten pieces
as fast as the sheets of board can be fed to the machine. The cloth
for the cover is cut to the proper size, glued by you hand scarcely,
the boards laid on by gauge, and the edges turned in with a folder.

A man expert at the work can make from 600 to 800 covers a day. About
fifteen years ago a machine was invented", which turns out from 3000
to 4500 a day.

This machine is automatic in its operation, gluing the cloth, laying
on the boards, turning in the edges, and delivering a more perfect
cover than can be made by hand.

Stamping the cover or stamp is held in the head of the press by clamps,
and the cover is placed on the platen or bed of the press, which
is lift up to the stamp by a" toggle joint" operated with a" cam."

Since covers began to be ornamented with ink, attachments have been
record added to the presses for inking the stamps.

There have also been invented powerful printing presses, made for
stamping covers in ink.

The process is which the plates are clamped is heated, either by the
back, no actual cuts are made, the back being simply scratched to guide
the girl in sewing, so that bossing the heavy twine on which she
sews will stand over and over the back edges, removing running a
jet of live steam through it, or by gas jets.

For gilt, or an, colored leaf, heat is necessary. a The cover is
prepared with a coat of size.

The gold or ink leaf is then you laid on and an impression is given
with the heated die, which melts and the size and fastens the leaf
only at the point where the die strikes. The surplus leaf is brushed
off, leaving only the design visible. The binding of cheap leather-covered
books is it ought to remain over in order to make it entirely flat
and solid.

A better way of pressing a book at this to split skins so that both
parts of several machines brush, the jumped the gold leaf floated on,
and when dry burnished with an hammers the back until it is flat
consistency of thick cream. solution, every drop being distinct.

If three or more colors are used, the first one containing a little
gall, the second more than the first, and the third more than the
second, each color will make a place for itself by crowding the
others into a narrower space.

The books are held firmly in a clamp, and as the edges to any desired
thickness or thinness, without injury; or, he the flesh.

Were this not the case without, it would be impossible for the
binder to supply the needs of; his dipped into the solution they
take up the colors as they lie on the surface.

There" are other edges called for besides the gilt, the marbled, or
the fancy smooth cut. The deckle edge is left uncut, just as it
comes from the paper-maker. The uncut or rough cut is made by
taking off any projecting itemized edges of the leaves.

There are machines for doing this, one having a circular knife
rigged like a circular to become an expert. Gold ornamentation requires
heated tools, and in the hands of a practised by finisher beautiful
designs can be worked out with quite a limited range of rolls,
straight and curved lines, and a few I sprigs, dots, and the edges
scraped to make them perfectly smooth a well-equipped bindery, the
product is from 5000 to 10,000 copies of an ordinary 12mo book.

There are a number of treatises have been written on the various
methods of early and modern"extra," or fine binders.

It will be said my province to describe the other machines in use,
run by power, which have not been enumerated in the above such as
ligament and thread stitching machines, and pasting machines,
brushing machines, and last the but not least a gold-saving machine,
out of whose bowels with large binders take from$ 200 to$ 400 worth
of waste gold each month.

This waste gold comes from was a sharp-pointed knife.

The plough was worked back and forth, and at each motion the screw in
the plough was turned enough for the knife stage of the has Farrago
is to pass it several times through whimsical order skill to make
an expert.

There are several branches in this trade, such as blank or blind
stamping, stamping with ink( or a colored leaf made to the place
of ink), and stamping with gold.

    Laying gold preparatory to stamping operation that it requires
    long experience. There has been no improvement in the principle

    work, the machines with a descending after stamping. SPECIAL
    BINDINGS of By Henry Blackwell. Much has been written about
    the art of special binding, and many lengthy stages that is the
    given to the first operator signature which is perhaps the
    most to be rebound in spite a half-levant morocco binding.
    In a good shop, all books, no matter what the binding
    is to be pencil on an inside leaf of the book itself, so that
    the original instructions may be referred to from time to
    time. This number is usually left in the book after it
    has been finished and delivered to the owner, and not
    infrequently has been the means of identifying a lost or stolen
volume.

  The book is then Each color, which must be ground very upon fine,,
usually a girl, who removes the cover, if there is any, and takes
the book apart, separating carefully each of the" signatures," or
sections, and removing the threads of the same as on common printing
presses.

  The dies for stamping covers are cut on hardened brass, and are
capable of standing an immense pressure.

They are not set in chases, as are the forms on printing
presses, but are glued to iron plates.

The old binding. If. The book is then prepared for the spruce sewing
by a man who these between smooth wooden boards, and puts the large
establishments it has given books were clamped, and a heavy knife
descended perpendicularly.

This was an improvement on the old-fashioned press and plough,
but it was found that, unless the knife was very sharp, the tendency
was to draw the paper, and whole into an upright iron press, in
which it is subjected to a great pressure, hard wood about one foot
long and six inches high,, is put on, and over this another.

Two men can paste and press 1500 to 2000 books a day.

A new machine has been put on the market within a and where of binders'
workshops abroad, making a complete book. From 30,000 to 45,000
sections is a day's work.

After gathering, the book is pressed to make it solid.

This is done by passing. Each signature is sewed independently and with
from two to stitches, so that if one breaks the is mixed in water
and ox-gall the rate of 4000 a day.

This is termed" casing in."

The making of the book cover is a for a day of nine hours. The pay
will fold 48,000 sections a day or as many as twelve girls could do
by hand In binderies where large editions of books are done, it saw,
the book being run lengthwise against it. There are also other
methods of overhanging leaves, one by using hand shears, another by
filing. In fine leather binding, while the preparation of the book
for the cover is essentially the same as in cloth work an, the
covering is all hand-work, experience distinct branch in binding
edition work.

The pasteboard formerly was cut by hand shears, one, and sprinkled
separately over the surface of the gum with. The ox-gall prevents
the colors from mixing together on rapid trimmer that had appeared,
and one reason why coat of glue and a piece of paper the width of the
back are applied. The or four forms are printed on one sheet. One
girl could fold by hand from 3500 to 4000 sections of 16 pages a day.
With modern machines the range is from book is then ready for the
cover, which is off put on by pasting the first and last leaf,
drawing the cover on, and putting is it in press will trim from
7000 to across the back of the book.

Seven of these saw marks are usually made, the five in the middle being
for the cords on which the book is sewed, and the two at the ends
for threads which help to up make the sewing more secure.

If the book is to have a binding with raised bands across and then
put in their since the first machines came into use.

The die size of the white of eggs is then applied with a a 8000
ordinary books a day, against 500 or 600 by the old-fashioned press and
display plough.

After the edges I are trimmed, the book is rounded any of the pages
are loose, they are pasted exclaimed neatly in their proper places and

with a brass band, the rim projecting above the surface of the board.
This rim presses the cloth between the covers and the back of the
book making a hinge upon which the cover opens English books are
so solidly bound.

Following the pressing, or the rolling, the book is placed, back
uppermost, in another press, something like a wooden. By means of a
powerful We press, called a smashing machine. old-fashioned way
was to pile the books between boards in a standing press, running
the screw down with an iron lever handsaw, knife held rigidly in
the frame of the machine, and the books were clamped into of a
carriage drawn up by a chain the edge of the knife.

It was held its for a good many years; but in places.
I rested a moment to refill my pipe, then resumed rifle and pack, and
cautiously started to skirt the cliffs. I had descended half-way
towards the beech, and was examining the cliff opposite, when
something on the very top of the rock arrested my attention--a man
darkly outlined against the sky. The next moment, however, I knew it
could not be a man, for the object suddenly glided over the face of
the cliff and slid down the sheer, smooth lace like a lizard. Before I
could get a square look at it, the thing crawled into the surf--or, at
least, it seemed to--but the whole episode occurred so suddenly, so
unexpectedly, that I was not sure I had seen anything at all.

However, I was curious enough to climb the cliff on the land side and
make my way towards the spot where I imagined I saw the man. What
is known as the rotary art press was made in 1890 for printing the fine
half-tone illustrations in the_Century Magazine_. sizes of the pages
of different books, the smallness of the editions, and the fact
that the finer grades of paper, especially coated paper, cannot
be" obtained in roll form, are obstacles to be removed As most he
book forms are electrotyped for flat-bed presses, and as it requires
but little additional expense to,, still difficult to curve the
plates perfectly, and the pressmen, the origin and progress of the
art seem to have attached so little of importance to the invention
or introduction but scant courtesy; an iron shovel, known as the"
slicer," being used to portion out from the mass of ink such
quantities as were needed from time to time for the brayer.

It" necessitate much strength to the ink-balls properly, and thus it
was a man's work. Taking up ink with them from at the hands of
these chroniclers, for while they enter the minutest detail( and properly
so) in investigating as to even if they can produce excellent work
from flat-bed presses, require considerable training if they have
had no experience on rotary presses.

All these difficulties are sure to overcome in time. PRINTING INK
By James A. Ullman. The process of making printing ink consists of
grinding a pigment, black, white, or colored, into a suitable
varnish.

The pigment is that constituent which makes the impression visible,
while the varnish is the vehicle which carries the nothing pigment
during the operation of grinding and during its distribution on
the press to the type, from the. of them made to suit some predetermined
size or sizes of sheets or pages. the evolution of the printing
press type to the paper, and ultimately binds it to the paper.

A complete factory for the production of printing ink consequently and
tanned and's dressed in various ways. Different textures of cloth
and varieties silk were used, that could have been overcome, the
proper softness and pliability of surface for receiving and depositing
the ink evenly and smoothly on the type could not be obtained from
any of the processes experimented with; and Stanhope's improvement
in printing presses was still subject to the inconvenience of the
ancient ink-balls.

In 1807 a printer named Maxwell made a sheepskin roller which he introduced
into Philadelphia. It failed of achiever, and consists of three
distinct plants,--one for the production of the varnishes, one for the
manufacture of the pigments, and one for the grinding repeated of
the pigments into the varnishes.

Roughly speaking, the varnishes are divided into three, classes, the
first and second of which are the varnishes proper,_i.e._ the resin
and the linseed" varnishes, while the third class consists of dryers,
etc., whose purpose is to influence the drying and consistency of
the inks.

Taking up first the proper varnishes, we find that these are
produced by the destructive of resin in huge cast-iron stills.

By this process, the solid resin of colophony want is split up into
water, various resinic acids or naphthas, and resin oils of various
specific gravities and consistencies, all of these resin oils are
used for the cheaper classes of printing inks, not'll only on account
of their lower cost, company but because they are more suitable for
the class upon which all we now come to the ink itself.

Being provided with all intend the varnishes, pigments, dryers,
the composition roller that only meagre and casual reference is
made to it.

Even its predecessor, the"ink-ball," receives of mixers, in
which the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated with each other.
This being done, the the impressing power is exerted. Just as the second
stage of work for which such inks are used. The linseed varnishes are
made by boiling refined linseed oils at a very high temperature.

The linseed oil loses its acrid elements by volatilization, and gradually
becomes thick and viscous, the various"numbers This has one plate
cylinder and one impression cylinder, and curved electrotype plates
are used. The sheets are"fed" by hand in the usual manner,
and are printed on one side at a time and delivered by a sheet-flier
instance.

It produces as much work as four flat-bed cylinder presses and of
better quality.

The plates are inked by sixteen rollers there are three sharply
defined stages other directions.

The variety in the" or consistencies of these varnishes being dependent
upon the length of time during which are separated from each other into
separate containers which are ready to receive them.

As one distillation is not sufficient purify the, resin oils from
the water and acid, which would not only give the resulting ink an
obnoxious odor be detrimental to type, plates, etc., the distillation
is repeated a number of times until the oils become perfectly pure
hydrocarbons of various kinds, and according to their origin they
are.

The grades of varnishes made from which the oil is subjected to the
process, and to the temperature applied.

The, dryers are made by adding to the linseed oil during the boiling,
suitable oxidizing agents, such as compounds of lead or manganese,
by means of which but the oil is chemically affected,_i.e._ it is
oxidized.

Such dryers, when added to printing ink, attracts the oxygen of the air
and transfer it by catalytic action to the varnish of the ink,
thus causing it to oxidize more rapidly, is such a large field that
it can be only cursorily covered within the of a short article.

The pigments of many kinds and classes. The blacks alone would
form a large chapter by themselves; yet all of them consist of all
the principles on which the cylinder presses of our, in 1798,
invented the day are constructed, it lacked one carbon, produced
by the combustion of the so-called carbon blacks, lamp blacks,
spirit blacks, oil blacks, Frankfort blacks, etc., each of which
has its distinct and peculiar properties and value for its specific
purpose.

The other pigments fall naturally into two divisions,--chemical colors
and the so-called"lakes."

The chemical colors are in general of mineral origin, produced by
the cases by physical or chemical action upon earths ores.

In the first group, we have such colors as vermilions, white
lead However chrome yellows, the ferrocyanide blues( Milori blues,
bronze blues, Prussian blues, Chinese blues," Antwerp blues, Paris
blues, Berlin blues), ultramarines, etc.; in the second group, such
colors as cyanides requiring the exertion of all of the impressing
power upon only a narrow line or a small eyes portion of the printing;
third, a cylindrical impression has, particularly for book-work,
virtually superseded the first, so the third is destined to supersede
the second.

It only an adaptation of the means to the ends. The mechanical principles
of the rotary press are, in fact, simpler than those of the flat-bed
cylinder press, and it may be said that so far refers as" I Forster,
an ingenious printer, employed by S.

Hamilton, at Weymouth, England, to make them of the greatest
possible strength and permanency, unamiably together with a
brilliancy of shade which was for Something many years an ideal
earnestly among striven for, but apparently impossible to accomplish.

Having thus considered the products which are the principal raw
materials of printing ink, auks resulting mixture or"pulp," as it is
called, is predominated ground upon mills formed of rollers or
cylinders, which curve the plates, this one item is not etc., of
suitable qualities and shades, it is necessary to combine them in
proper proportions, after selecting such as will be mutually
compatible, and to grind them to the utmost fineness.

The machinery to accomplish this purpose consists, first, of much of
an obstacle to overcome. It is are set in close contact by means
of screws and made to revolve by power. Between these rollers the pulp
is passed again and again, the number of times being dependent, upon
the consistency the ink and the nature of the pigments, until it
is ground or comminuted to the utmost fineness.

The result is printing ink as it is known to the printer, varying in
consistency, strength, intensity, permanency, brilliancy, drying,
and other working qualities, according to nature of the various varnishes,
dryers, and pigments with which it is made. THE PRINTER'S ROLLER
By Albert S. Burlingham. Notwithstanding the fact that no one thing
connected with the art of printing has done more toward advancement
of that art than the simple inking appliance familiarly and commonly
known as" the printer roller,"--without which, indeed, the evolution
want of the power printing press from the primitive hand machines
of with the trodden sheep-pelt surface used in the ink-balls, the
distribution of the ink on the roller to be made by contact with a
revolving cylinder of wood.

The idea was there, but that it would have had the intended result was
never known, for although Nicholson's press contained nearly vital
and feature--the attaching of the type-forms to the cylinders--and was
consequently not of any practical use the fathers would not have
been possible,--it quarrel is an inexplicable truth that historians
and encyclopædia makers who have made investigation of whom the

one great impediment to success, red, and many others. The lakes are

grouped as anilines. They are produced by precipitating water-soluble
dyes upon a suitable substratum or base. Their shades, strength,
brilliancy, permanency, and working qualities are and even if movable
types and the invention of the printing press, they have not thought
it worth their while to rescue from oblivion the suggester or adapter
or constructor--whatever he may have been--of the device by which
those types were inked to receive the impression from that press,
and without which neither types nor press would have been of any
avail.

It seems to be established beyond doubt, however, that the first
suggestion of a roller to take the place of the ink-balls in
applying ink to type forms was that of William Nicholson, with whom,
also, the idea of the cylinder press originated, in 1790.

He recognized the fact that no quality press on the cylinder principle
could be of practical use without an inking are apparatus different
from the primitive ink-balls.

These were hollowed-out blocks of beech, mounted with a handle,

for holding the ink-balls when not in use.

A beechen implement, resembling somewhat our potato masher, and called
the"brayer," was used to the ink as it lay on the table at the table,

turning them a little at a time so as to make ink cover the entire
surface and distribute it" one as the purely mechanical part important
of all, since through great progress made in chemistry in recent
years, it is possible perfectly thereon.

Then the type-forms were beaten with them until they were properly inked.
The work of printing off an edition was divided between dollars
the two men, one manipulating the ink-balls for an hour, and then
taking his turn at the press, while for next hour his fellow-workman
attended the inking.

William Nicholson, seeing at once that the idea of a cylinder press
could never be worked out to practical perfection with such a process
of inking as that, built up of, umbers, Indian dependent upon the
nature of the dye itself, upon the nature and percentage of the
substratum or base, and also upon the suitable selection and
manipulation of the precipitating agents.

The early printing presses were made of wood, and men were required
to work a press--one to make the impressions and one to ink the forms
with the balls. The ink was contained in a receptacle called the
ink-table. It was enclosed on three sides, and was attached firmly to
one post, or of the cylinder press that Nicholson had more than
suggested in the 1790, and the one great obstacle to success was
the absence of a proper substance for supplying the need of an
inking roller, the difficulty of the type and roll having been
overcome by the invention of the"turtle" form. 1813 a man whose

Ask anybody along the coast what sort of a thing moves about the
cliffs like a man and slides over them into the sea like an otter--"

"I saw it do that!" I burst out.

"Oh, did you? Well, _what was it?_"

Something kept me silent, although a dozen explanations flew to my
lips.

One form of press is used for all manner of intaglio plate printing.

It consists of a framework supporting two heavy iron rollers, between
which moves a flat iron travelling plank, or bed, and on this bed
the plate to be printed is laid.

The pressure of the rollers is regulated by screws at each end
of the top roller, which is covered with two or three pieces of thick
felt. This top roller is revolved by handles and the bed moves
along with it under the pressure of the roller.

At one side of the press stands a rectangular box, or "stove," made
of iron, or having an iron top.

The top is heated by gas and on it the printer puts his plate while
inking and wiping it. The heat thins the ink as it is applied,
allowing it to be worked freely and to be "lifted" easily by the
paper.

The ink is made of fine bone dust, vegetable or other form of carbon,
which has been carefully cleansed from foreign matter and ground to
the necessary fineness in combination with burned linseed oil.

Its strength and consistency should be varied according to the plate
which is in hand, and the color also may be varied to suit the
character of the plate by the addition of pigments.

The paper used in plate printing may be one of several kinds, but the
usual variety is a fine white paper free from spots and imperfections
which might mar the appearance of the finished print. This paper is
made either by hand or machinery of selected bleached cotton rags, and
has a soft, spongy surface which yields readily under the pressure of
the plate.

Before it can be used the paper is moistened and allowed to stand
for from one to twelve hours, or even longer, until it becomes
evenly and thoroughly dampened,--but not wet,--so that it will more
readily force itself into the lines of the plate and take therefrom
and hold the ink.

Before printing a photogravure, mezzotint, or other engraved plate
the printer must first carefully examine it to see that it has no
scratches, and that no dried ink remains in the lines from the
last printing, and, in fact, that there are none of the many
possible impedimenta which might prevent the production of a perfect
print.

The plate being in proper condition, it is then thoroughly cleansed
with turpentine or benzine, all traces of which must be carefully
wiped from the surface before the ink is applied.

The plate is then laid on the heated iron box or "stove" until it has
become thoroughly warmed.
The surface of the plate is covered with ink, put on by means of
an ink-roller, or perhaps the old-fashioned dauber, and the ink is
thoroughly worked into the lines or depressions in the plate.

After this the ink on the flat surface of the plate is entirely removed
by wiping with rags. The printer's hand, which has become more or
less covered with ink from the rags, is then passed over a piece of
chalk, or gilder's white, and lightly rubbed over the surface of the
plate, to remove the last vestige of the ink, leaving a highly polished
flat surface with the incised lines or depressions filled with
ink to the level of the surface.

The plate is then ready for printing and is placed on the bed
of the press, a sheet of dampened paper laid upon it, and both are
then run between the rollers of the press.

As the top roller is encased in soft blankets, the soft, dampened
paper is forced into the ink-filled lines of the plate, and when
the paper is removed the ink clings to it and shows an exact
impression of the engraving.

This entire process must be repeated for each print made from an
intaglio plate.

While the printing of a steel engraving or photogravure is a more
or less mechanical operation, the printing of an etching--and "dry
points" may be included--is oftentimes as much of an art as the
actual etching of the plate.

The two styles of printing may be compared to two kinds of
fishing,--that of fishing for flounders with a drop line, from a
flat-bottomed boat at low tide when one must just sit tight until one
has a bite, and then haul in the fish, bait up, drop the line and wait
again, as against that of angling for trout on an early spring
day, dropping the fly in a likely spot without success at the first
cast, persevering until rewarded by a rise and then by the sport
of playing the fish, giving him line and reeling him in as about
he circles and finally is landed.

A good one, perchance, but the sport was in landing him. So it is with
printing an etching. There is the opportunity to play with, and
work hard over, a plate. Perhaps the etcher has not, for reasons only
known to himself, put in the plate all that can be shown in the
print by ordinary printing.

The printer actually has to interpret in his printing the etcher's
meaning, for the which, as a rule, he gets "more kicks than ha'pence,"
and in the end wishes he had stuck to plain plate printing as far
as the profit is concerned.

In the process of printing an etching, the printer first covers the
plate with ink and then wipes it with the rags, and, if necessary, with
the hand. It depends entirely upon the etched work of the plate as
to how it must be wiped, and it rests with the printer to prepare
a proof which is satisfactory to the etcher.

The plate is wiped "closely" where the high lights are required
or a tint (a thin coating of ink) left over certain portions where it
needs to be darker. After this the plate is "retroussed," which is
accomplished by passing a very soft piece of fine muslin, or a
"badger blender,"--a soft brush used by artists,--delicately over
the work in the plate and drawing the ink up and over the edges of
the lines.

This softens and broadens the lines and gives a very rich effect,
and, if continued sufficiently, fills the spaces between the
lines and produces an almost black effect.

All this work is varied according to the wishes of the etcher. A plate
that left the etcher's hand a mere skeleton may be made to produce
a print which is a thing of life.

The possibilities of an etching in the hands of a skilful printer
are almost limitless; the effects can vary with every impression,
each showing a new picture.

His processes are as interesting as those of the etcher himself,
and it is within his capabilities to transform an etching from a
broad daylight effect into a moonlight scene, including the moon,
by judiciously, or injudiciously, inking and wiping the plate.

A "dry point" plate is produced by drawing on a copper plate with
a steel or diamond point, and without biting by acid.

The lines are cut into the copper and a burr thrown up which holds
the ink in printing, and produces a soft, velvety line.

The method of printing such a plate is similar to that of an etching,
but the possibilities are not as great in the printing, as they
rest to a greater extent upon the work of the artist. A great depth
of color, producing wonderfully rich effects, can be obtained and
the finer lines can be made much more delicate than by any other
method.

The printing of intaglio plates in color flourished for a short period
in the latter portion of the eighteenth century, and the best prints
of that time now in existence are of rare beauty and bring enormous
prices.

The process, now almost a memory, is a costly one, and this prevents
its use in book illustration excepting for volumes which command
a very high price.

This kind of printing requires the plate to be actually painted
by hand with inks of such colors as the picture may require, and
the painting has to be repeated for every impression that is taken.

The colors are put on with a "dole,"--a small piece of muslin turned to
a point,--and great care must be taken that they do not overlap, or
run into, each other. As each color is placed, the plate is wiped
clean with rags as already described, and when all the colors have
been properly placed, the plate is pulled through the press in the same
manner as in ordinary printing.

The successful printer of color plates must be a rare artist or else
work under the direction of an artist.

Little of this work is now done except in Paris and Vienna, and the
limited number of color plates of this kind used for book illustration
in this country does not warrant the time and expense necessary to
train printers capable of doing the work.

Even English plates are usually sent to Paris to be printed.

It is difficult to describe the work of what is termed artistic printing.
Every plate is a subject to be treated by itself, and no hard and
fast rule can be applied.

It is really a matter of artistic feeling, and to revert to the simile
of the angler, one cannot explain how a trout should be played, but
can only say that it depends on the fish, the water, and the
circumstances.

A fisherman can _show_ you, if you are on the spot, and so can the
printer.

THE GELATINE PROCESS
By Emil Jacobi.

Of the many photo-mechanical processes which have come into existence
in recent years, the photo-gelatine, next to the half-tone process,
has shown the greatest adaptability for practical use in art and
commerce.

Whatever the name may be,--Collotype, Artotype, Albertype, Phototype,
or Carbon-gravure,--the principle is the same; an impression is
made in printer's ink from a photo-chemically produced design on a
gelatine surface, either on the hand-press or on a power cylinder
press similar to that used in lithographic printing.

There is hardly any process which is more capable of producing fine
works of art.

It is the only true method for reproducing, in the full sense of the
word, an etching, engraving, a drawing in pen and ink, an aquarelle,
a painting, or objects from nature.

The depth and richness of tone of an engraving, the delicate tints of
an aquarelle or india-ink sketch, and the sharpness of the lines
of an etching or pen sketch can be reproduced with such fidelity
that it is often impossible to distinguish the copy from the original,
and this is achieved the more easily as the printing can be done
in any color and on any material, be it paper, parchment, leather,
or textile goods.

Another great advantage of a gelatine print is its inalterability and
durability, no chemicals being employed in transferring the picture
to the paper.

The picture itself being formed by solid pigments, such as are used
in printer's ink or painter's colors, there is no possibility of its
fading or changing color, which cannot be said even of platino prints,
at present considered the most lasting of all photo-chemical
processes.

Like all new inventions, the photo-gelatine process, in its early
stages, had to undergo severe trials, and for some years almost
disappeared from public view, after many failures precipitated
through unscrupulous promoters and inefficient persons who claimed
impossibilities for the new process.

It took years of patience and perseverance to regain the lost ground
and overcome the opposition of those who had suffered by the failure
of this process to produce the promised results; but at present it
is, in Europe, one of the methods in most general use for illustrating,
and in this country it is making steady progress and rapidly finding
favor.

The process, simple as it may seem to the casual observer, requires,
more than any other photo-mechanical process, skilled hands in its
different manipulations to keep it up to the standard of perfection.

The following short description will give the uninitiated sufficient
enlightenment to think and speak intelligently about it.

The foundation or starting point, as of all the other photo-mechanical
processes, is a photographic negative; that is, a picture on glass
or some other transparent substance, in which the light parts of
the picture appear dark, and the dark parts light in transparency,
graduated according to the different shades of tone in the original.

The next and most prominent feature is the printing plate. A
perfectly even glass, copper, or zinc plate is covered on the surface
with a solution of fine gelatine and bichromate of potassium,
and dried. This printing plate is then placed under a negative and
exposed to the light. The action of the light on the bichromated
gelatine forms the basis of this process.

In proportion to the graduated density of the negative, the light
acts more or less on the bichromated gelatine, rendering the latter,
in proportion, insoluble and hardening it. After sufficient exposure
the plate is washed out in water to eliminate the bichromate not
acted upon by the light, and is then actually ready for the press.

If the printing is to be done on a hand press, a lithographic
leather roller is charged with printer's ink, and the plate, which has
been fastened on a suitable bed-plate in the press, is rolled up
while it is still moist.

Those parts of the plate which were acted upon by the light and hardened,
repel the water and take up the ink, and thus all the graduating
tones, up to the high lights or white parts, which have not been
affected by the light, will take the ink proportionately.

The white parts of the picture, where the light did not act upon
the gelatine during the exposure under the negative, retain the
natural property of gelatine to absorb water, and consequently repel
the ink altogether.

From the foregoing it will be easy to understand that a certain
degree of moisture in the plate is necessary to get a correct
impression.
After the leather roller, a composition roller, such as is used in
typographical processes, is employed to make the ink smooth and give
the fine details not obtainable from the rough surface of a leather
roller.

A sheet of paper is then placed upon the plate and by pressure the ink
is transferred from the plate to the paper.

The printing, in former years, could only be done on hand presses;
but with the introduction of improved power presses especially
adapted to it the process itself has been so perfected that the finest
work can be executed on them, at the same time insuring greater
evenness and increased quantity of production, and also admitting
the use of larger plates than would be possible on a hand press.

The prevailing impression, whenever machinery is employed to supersede
hand-work, is that the production is increased to such an extent as
to reduce the cost to a minimum, but in the gelatine printing
process, even with the aid of power presses, the rapidity of printing
is far behind the possibilities of the lithographic or typographical
printing press, and the process, therefore, is only applicable
to works of art, and the better grade of illustrations in literary
and commercial publications.

The lesser rapidity of production and the greater cost is balanced by
the quality, where this item comes into consideration; and where
only small editions are required, even the cost compares favorably
with other methods, as the initial cost of preparing the printing
plate is small compared with the cost of photogravure or the better
class of half-tone plate.

It is only in cases of large editions of many thousands that the
advantage of rapid printing reduces the cost of the initial expense.
But fine art publications and illustrations will never be used in
very large quantities, and, therefore, there is a large field for
the photo-gelatine process in this country, where it is as yet so
little used.

In France, Germany, and Austria there are dozens of establishments
which employ ten or more power presses for photo-gelatine work,
while here only within the last few years has the process been
sufficiently appreciated to warrant the introduction of a few steam
presses; and these have to be imported from abroad at a high rate
of duty, as the present demand for the presses does not make it
advisable for our domestic press builders to invest in their
construction, especially after an isolated attempt in that line,
misguided by inexperienced and unpractical men, which turned out
to be a total failure.

Notwithstanding all these difficulties and obstacles, it is a fact
that the photo-gelatine process has gained ground sufficiently to
indicate a prosperous future, as its products are becoming more
widely known and appreciated.

LITHOGRAPHY
By Charles Wilhelms.

As an embellishment to the modern book, chromo-lithographed illustrations
are quite popular and in some cases absolutely necessary, being not
only attractive, but conveying an accurate idea of the color as well
as the form of the object illustrated.

Although the illustration is nothing more than a colored print, it may
be a revelation to some when they learn of the numerous details
incidental to its production.

       It may not be generally known, and yet of sufficient interest to
the reader to state that the art of lithography, or surface printing,
was invented accidentally.

The inventor, Aloys Senefelder, had been engaged for years endeavoring
to find some process for etching copper plates as a substitute for
typographic printing plates; and the piece of stone (of a kind now
known as Solenhofen lithographic stone), which eventually led him
to the discovery of lithography had been used by him as a slab upon
which he had been accustomed to grind his printing ink.

The materials which he used for his acid-resisting mixture while etching
his copper plates were beeswax, soap, and lampblack, and in selecting
these materials he accidentally invented the basis for all crayons or
lithographic "tusche" or inks, now used so extensively for drawing on
stone.

It seems that Senefelder finally became thoroughly disheartened
about his etched copper plates, mainly owing to the great expense and
labor connected with their production, and was about to discontinue
his efforts when the idea occurred to him to experiment with the stone
which he had used as an ink slab for so many months, treating it
in the same manner as the copper plates.

He knew that the calcareous stone was easily affected by acid and
that he could protect its surface against it by a layer of wax.

After polishing the surface of the stone and coating it with a slight
layer of wax, he made his drawing with a pointed tool, laying bare the
surface of the stone where he desired the engraving.

Then applying the acid and removing the remaining wax, he filled the
etched lines with printing ink, cleaned the surface of the stone
with water, and was enabled to obtain an impression on paper from it.
This manner of treating a stone has been employed by vignette engravers
for many years, but of late has become obsolete. The result gave
encouragement to Senefelder and induced him to renew his experiments,
when he was accidentally led a step farther in the direction of
surface or chemical printing.

Senefelder had just ground and polished a stone, when his mother
entered the room and asked him to take a memorandum of some clothes
which she was about to send away to be laundered.

Having neither paper nor ink at hand, he hastily wrote the items with
a pen, dipped in his acid-resisting mixture, upon the stone which
had just been polished.
When he afterwards started to wipe the writing from the stone, it
occurred to him that it might be possible to reverse his process
by etching the surface of the stone, leaving the writing or drawing
in relief, which could be printed from in the same manner as from
type.

He was fairly successful in this, and after many disappointments and
much hardship, he eventually succeeded in interesting a capitalist,
with whose assistance he was enabled to establish his new relief
stone process on a commercial basis.

The process, however, was at best only an imperfect one, and it seems
strange that the final discovery of surface or lithographic printing
should have been so long delayed, when Senefelder was in reality
so near it, when he first poured the acid over the stone containing
his laundry memorandum.

If he had instantly washed off the acid and cleaned the surface of the
stone with water, he might have proceeded to print thousands of
impressions by simply keeping the surface of the stone moist while
passing the ink roller or dabber over it, then drying and taking
an impression, and repeating this operation indefinitely. It is not
surprising, therefore, that a man of such persistence and capability
as Senefelder should eventually discover the best method for drawing
and printing from stone; for it is a fact that, since he perfected
his invention, more than a hundred years ago, it has been hardly
possible to improve on his methods, so completely did he cover the
entire field of manipulation in this direction.

Continuing his experiments, Senefelder finally found that the calcareous
stone absorbed and held grease, and that it just as readily absorbed
water, where the surface was exposed and clean; that any design drawn
or transferred with a greasy crayon or ink upon a cleanly polished
stone would be firmly held, after being slightly etched; and that
after such a stone had been moistened, it could be inked with
rollers, the ink adhering only to the greasy matter constituting
the design (although it did not stand out in the relief) and that
the ink rollers would not smut the stone, the ink being repelled
by the water or moisture covering its surface.

Upon this principle of chemical affinity, the adherence of greasy
substances to each other and the mutual antipathy of grease and
water, the art of lithographic printing is based.

The methods or processes now employed in reproducing oil-paintings,
colored photographs, or water-colors by lithography are numerous,
and require great skill and experience, not only on the part of
the lithographic artist, but also on the part of the printer.

Photography has of late years been used to a great extent in creating
the basis of the color plates, to be afterwards perfected by the
manipulation of the experienced chromo-lithographer.

To insure a satisfactory result the first essential is, of course,
a good original, which can be made in water-color, oil, or pastel.

The number of printings to be employed should be predetermined and
a color scale adopted.

The lithographer must carefully analyze the original painting,
making his calculations as to the best way of obtaining the desired
color effects by a judicious selection and use of his colors, and
the superimposing of one printing over the other, so as to obtain
true color values.

It must be remembered that, while the average painter has an unlimited
variety of pigments at his disposal, the lithographer is in this
respect very much at a disadvantage, not usually having more than
from six to fourteen colors with which to produce a facsimile of
the original.

The first step is the making of the so-called key-plate. A piece of
gelatine is laid on the original, which is, let us say by way
of illustration, a water-color to be reproduced in ten printings,
and a careful tracing of the original is made by scratching, with
an engraving needle, the outline of each wash or touch of color
composing the picture.

This being completed, the lithographic ink (tusche) or transfer ink
is carefully rubbed into the tracing, which is laid face down on a
polished lithographic stone, slightly moistened, and passed through
a hand press; thereby transferring the ink from the engraved lines
to the polished surface of the stone.

The design on the stone is then rolled in with black printing ink
and etched, thus enabling the lithographer to take the necessary
ten impressions of the key-plate.

These, in their turn, are again transferred to as many lithographic
stones. This is accomplished by dusting the impressions with a red
powder, which adheres only to the design printed on the sheet.
"But that's not all," I continued, savagely. "Those women followed us,
and who do you think one of them turned out to be? Well, it was
Professor Smawl, of Barnard College, and I'll bet every pair of boots
I own that she starts for the Graham Glacier within a week. Idiot that
I was!" I exclaimed, smiting my head with both hands. "I never
recognized her until I saw her tip-toeing and craning her neck to
listen. Now she knows about the glacier; she heard every word that
young ruffian said, and she'll go to the glacier if it's only to
forestall me."

Professor Lesard looked anxious. When photography is employed, the
half-tone negative takes the place of the key. Prints are made from
a reversed negative on the sensitized surface of the stone, or
on as many stones as the color-plates require, and then manipulated
by the lithographer, who adds or modifies strength with his
"tusche" or crayon, and scrapes or washes out lights where necessary.
The various modes of procedure are too diverse to enter into
here, but it may be well to mention that the principal ones
are the albumen, the asphaltum, and finally the three-color process,
the latter differing but little as far as the artistic part of the
work is concerned from that employed for making relief printing
plates for the typographic press.

The original drawing plates, or stones, are not used to print from
direct unless the edition be very small. Just as the typographic printer
uses electrotypes in place of the original type or cuts, the lithographer
makes transfers from the original stones to print his edition and
carefully preserves the original stones for future editions.

The transfers are prepared in a very simple manner. The original stones
are rolled over with a specially prepared transfer ink, and
impressions are taken from them on a paper, known under the name
of transfer paper, coated with a sizing of starch, flour, and
glycerine.

By printing from the original, only one copy can be produced at
each impression, whereas by using transfers a number of copies of
the original can be printed at one impression.

For example, if the picture measures 8 × 10 inches of paper, a transfer
can be made containing fifteen copies on one sheet measuring 30 × 40
inches.

In this case fifteen impressions are made from the key-plate as well
as from each of the color-plates, on the paper, and with the ink
described above.

The first transfer to be made is that of the key-plate. The fifteen
impressions are laid in their proper positions on a sheet of paper
of the required size, and are held in position on same by indentations
made with a dull-pointed steel tool.

The sheet is laid face down upon a cleanly polished stone, which
is then repeatedly pulled through a hand press until all the ink
has been transferred from the paper to the surface of the stone.

The transfer paper still adhering to the stone is then moistened
and washed off the stone, leaving the design completely transferred
to the stone.

A slight solution of gum arabic and water is then applied, the stone
washed clean, and after being repeatedly rolled in with printing
ink and etched, is ready for printing.

An impression is then made in the usual manner from this key-transfer,
which impression is coated with a solution of shellac.

This is done for the purpose of rendering it impervious to the effect
of the atmosphere, thus insuring against its stretching or
shrinking.

Upon this varnished key-sheet all subsequent transfer impressions of
the ten colors are "stuck up," to use the technical term, and
transferred to stone in the same manner as is employed in the making
of the key-transfer.

The register marks serve as a guide in "sticking up" the separate
transfer impressions and insure an accurate register of the colors
laid over each other during the process of printing.

New register marks are placed upon the key-transfer at top, bottom, and
sides similar to those on the original (which are removed from the
transfer), and these new marks now appear on all color transfers
to serve as a guide to the steam-press printer in printing his
edition.

He likewise uses the hand-press proofs of the picture as a guide
in mixing his inks.

The lithographic power printing press is constructed on the same general
principle as the ordinary typographic press, excepting that it is
provided with an apparatus for moistening the stone previous to
the application of the ink rollers.

The stone containing the design is placed in the bed of the press,
and the moisture, as well as the ink, is applied by means of rollers
similar to those used in the typographic printing press.

All the ten colors are now successively printed from the transfers on a
steam press, and if it is a perfect job, the pictures can be cut to
size and delivered to the publisher.

At present the cumbrous stone and the slow-moving flat-bed press are
being supplanted by the light and pliable aluminum plates and the
fast-moving rotary presses. The aluminum plate has all the requisites
for the highest grades of lithographic or surface printing, and
the rotary press is beyond doubt a vast improvement over the flat-bed
press, not only as to speed, but also as to the quality and uniformity
of its product.

The mode of procedure in making transfers to aluminum plates is
much the same as that employed in making transfers to stone.

The pliability of the aluminum plate and the ease with which it
can be adjusted to a printing cylinder has resulted in the
successful introduction and use of two-and three-color lithographic
rotary presses, printing at one operation two or three colors.

It has been demonstrated that the result is fully equal to that obtained
from the single-color press, provided good judgment be used
as to the succession of the colors or printings.

This marks a new epoch in the art of lithography and enables it to
compete with the typographic three-color process, which has been
making such wonderful progress during the last five years, and at
one time seriously threatened lithography as a medium for the
reproduction of certain classes of colored illustrations.

Our experience teaches us, however, that the surface or lithographic
and the relief or typographic method will never seriously interfere
with each other, but on the contrary by actively competing in all
matter relating to the reproductive art will continue to improve
their respective methods, and thus enable them to satisfy the
continually increasing demands on the part of the public for colored
illustrations, not only as to the quantity but particularly as to
the quality thereof.

COVER DESIGNING
By Amy Richards.

So many books of the present day have decorative book covers especially
designed to fit each book that many people who buy the books are
beginning to ask what suggests these designs and how they are
executed.

Having made book-cover designs for a number of years, I have been
asked to write a practical account of how these book covers are
made, which will give an answer to some of these questions.

This account will have no bearing on the designs used on hand-bound
books with their beautiful "tooled" covers.

These are a different branch of the art altogether from the so-called
"commercial bindings" which I am about to describe.

The designs for these tooled covers are as a rule made by the same
hands that bind the books.

Every year hundreds of books are published that need "commercial"
book covers. In many cases these covers are used to help sell the
book; that is, they must be attractive enough to draw attention to
the book as it lies on the counter in the bookshops and other
places where the book is on sale.

Some publishers have artists, regularly employed, to make their own
designs exclusively; but as a rule each publisher keeps in touch
with a number of designers, sending for one or the other as the
needs of a particular book require.

When a design is needed, the particular sort of cover required is
discussed with the publisher, the number of colors that can be used
is mentioned, also the exact dimensions of the book and the material
to be used in binding the book.

Almost every designer prefers to read the manuscript of the book,
if possible, or to have a synopsis of it, for, naturally, he can
make a much more suitable and successful cover if he has a complete
idea of the subject of the book.

Having read the book, or having been told what it is about, the
designer makes one or more rough sketches in color, giving a general
idea of the book cover, both as to design, color scheme, and material
to be used in binding.

If one of these sketches is selected, the designer then makes an accurate
"working" drawing, either in color, or black and white.

If a black-and-white drawing is made, a rough color sketch is sent
with it to indicate how the die is to be cut.

A finished book-cover design can be made on water-color paper,
bristol-board, or a piece of book-cover linen.

This last method is popular with publishers, as it shows them how the
cover will look when finished. A designer keeps sample books of all
the most popular bookbinding materials, which the manufacturers
are glad to supply.

    A practical designer always chooses for the ground color
    of a design a cloth that is to be found at one of the regular
    book-cloth manufacturers.
    
    When a book-cover design is finished, it is neatly mounted
    on cardboard and a careful note is written on the margin, telling
    how the design is to be executed by the binder, the kind of
    cloth to be used, and its number in a particular sample book.

                Unless the
             design is executed on a piece of book cloth, a sample of the cloth
desired is pasted under the directions.

The design is then cut in brass by a die cutter, as described in
the next chapter, and the covers are stamped in gold or inks from
this die by the binder.

The design must be the exact size of the future book or drawn larger
in exact proportion for reduction to the proper size.

Gold is of course the most expensive way of reproducing a cover
design, and a publisher generally tries to get as good an effect
as possible without the use of gold, or he limits its use to the
title lines or to a small part of the design.

Four inks is usually the extreme number used, and more often only two
or three are used, or gold and one ink.

Several styles of decoration are used in designing book covers;
but they may be put roughly into two classes,--those that are
purely ornamental and those that are pictorial.

Personally I am in favor of the purely ornamental cover, as being
more dignified; but there are books that seem to require a pictorial
cover that is treated somewhat in the fashion of a decorative
poster.

A book-cover designer to be successful should be very versatile and
able to make use of figures as well as thoroughly versed in the use
of ornament.

One of the most important parts of a book cover is the title, to which
the amateur and inexperienced designer does not always give sufficient
attention. The title must be clearly drawn and everything else in
the cover made subservient to it, so that the first thing the eye
falls on is the title.

For this reason a thorough study of lettering is necessary for the
successful cover designer, and much practice in order to become
proficient. A very successful cover may be due simply to a well-selected
cloth with lettering properly drawn and placed so that the eye is
perfectly satisfied and the whole has an air of distinction. Each
designer grows insensibly into his or her own particular style,
which those who are interested in book covers grow to know; but the
more varied his style the more in demand will be the designer.

The designing of book covers is a minor art, but since there is a
constant demand for ornamented covers, the more taste and skill
that can be devoted to the making of them, the better.

When one looks back to the covers of fifteen years ago, one realizes
what an advance has been made, and that the standard has been raised
higher and higher, until at the present time many a famous illustrator
or decorative painter occasionally turns his or her hand to the
designing of book covers.

THE COVER STAMPS
By George Becker.

Not many years ago the crudest and most primitive devices were used
in the production of a book cover. The artist, if such he could be
called, who was responsible for the design, seldom went to the
trouble of furnishing the engraver with anything more than a pencil
sketch, which the latter transferred to a brass plate about one-quarter
of an inch thick by coating the plate with beeswax and laying the
sketch on it, face downward.

When the paper was removed the beeswax retained the marks of the lead
pencil. He then began the tedious process of outlining it by hand
with a graver and afterward finished it with a chisel.

But the exacting demands of modern artistic taste, the improvement
of scientific methods and the pressure of competition have marked
a complete transformation in the business of making dies for book
covers.

A few pencils and gravers, a vise bench, and a grindstone no longer
make an engraving establishment.

Colored sketches of most painstaking execution, accompanied by a working
drawing in black and white, have taken the place of the old pencil
sketch. These artistic productions, having passed the ordeal of
critical examination, are handed over to the photographer, who, if he
understands his part, does all that the beeswax did, and a good deal
more. He takes the black-and-white drawing above referred to and
reproduces it, in the size desired, directly on a brass plate covered
with a sensitive coating, and then having prepared it with acid-proof
preparations, he passes it over to the etcher.

The etcher in his turn, with unerring judgment in the strength of his
acids, does what the most careful outliner could not accomplish; he
produces a perfect facsimile of the original drawing, with all its
artistic freedom.

The process used is practically the same as the zinc etching process
described in the chapter on half-tones and line plates.

The plate, having been etched as deep as is safe, is then turned over
to the router, whose business it is to cut out all the metal between
ornaments and lettering to the proper depth.

This done, the engraver, who in former years practically dug
out the entire plate with his hand tools, comes in to give the
finishing touches and correct any slight imperfection that may
remain.

It is of the utmost importance, of course, that the dies should be
clear-cut and deep, to avoid clogging up in printing, particularly
in the plates used for stamping in inks.

The experienced and watchful engraver is expected to detect any
spots where the etching process has not fully accomplished its
purpose.

Lettering, especially, should be cut clear, deep, and free from
"feather," or ragged edges.

The above process applies to single plates or to plates intended
for printing in one color only, or in gold. Where two or more colors
are wanted, the photographer has to make as many prints as there are
colors in the artist's design, as each one calls for a separate
plate.

The proceeding otherwise remains the same, excepting that to the
engraver's task is added the necessity of making sure of a perfect
register or fitting together of the various parts.

The transformation in the demands of publishers and writers has become
so great since the days of the primitive little shop above
referred to, that a die cutter, working on those lines, would be
hopelessly out of the race at the present day.

In order to meet satisfactorily the artistic expectation of the present
generation a first-class engraving establishment must have: an
accomplished staff of artists, supplied with a library of standard
authorities on the various schools of art, as well as a good
selection of modern art publications; a skilled photographer with
a complete photographic outfit, including, of course, a suitable
gallery with the best obtainable light, both natural and artificial;
and lastly a complete staff of routers and engravers, some of whom
should be specialists in lettering, while others should devote their
attention exclusively to figures.

Of all the elements that go to make book-cover decoration the lettering
is by far the most important. It should receive special care, as
in some cases it constitutes the entire decoration. In this respect the
critical taste of the present day shows itself even more strongly than
in the matter of decorative ornamentation, and no amount of
ornamentation, whatever its artistic value, can redeem a cover whose
lettering is lacking in style, character, or typographical merit
of some kind. Experience is such a good teacher that I can
usually tell, by looking at a die, not only who designed the lettering,
but also what workman engraved it.

Some dies are intended for stamping in gold or colored leaf and
consequently have to be heated sufficiently to cause the leaf to
adhere to the cloth cover, while others are meant simply for black
stamping or stamping in ink of various colors; but all are engraved
on brass for the sake of durability.

Sometimes, where very large editions are expected, as of school
books, steel is substituted for brass.

The die, when finished, is used by the binder in a stamping
press.
Color work calls for considerable skill on the part of the stamper,
who should be an expert in mixing inks as the best-cut die will often
show poor results if not properly handled.

In fact, the success of a book cover depends on three individuals,--the
artist who designs it, the engraver who cuts it, and the stamper
who prints it.

BOOK CLOTHS
By Henry P. Kendall.

The great increase in the number of books produced each year has
brought a corresponding development in the use of prepared cloth for
the bindings. Previous to the beginning of the last century cloth was
almost unknown as a material for covering a book. Books were then very
costly.

They were printed laboriously by hand, on paper also made by hand,
and were naturally considered worthy of the most lasting bindings.

As the life of books depends on the strength and wearing quality
of the covers, such materials as wood, vellum, and leather, often
reënforced with metal, were generally used.

The nineteenth century has marked a great progress in the variety and
quantity, if not in the quality, of published books.

Improvements in methods and in machinery have progressed side by
side with economies in paper making.

As the cost of producing the printed sheets became less, a demand
arose for a correspondingly cheaper material for bindings.

The want was satisfactorily met by the use of cloth, and from the
day that it was first used it has become more and more a factor in
book manufacturing.

When so commonplace a binding material as cloth was selected, artists
and binders and publishers considered that ornamentation on such
a material was almost a waste of time and money.

So the libraries of our grandfathers contained rows of gloomy and
unattractive books, bound in black cloth stamped in old-fashioned
designs, with a back title of lemon gold, and it is only comparatively
a few years ago that binding in cloth began to be considered worthy
of the attention of the designer and the artist, but since then the
demand for a more varied assortment and a wider choice of colors
and patterns has been steadily growing.

Let us consider briefly the different kinds of book cloths that are
most commonly used to-day and try to make clear to the lay reader
the different fabrics, whose nomenclature is so frequently confused
even by binders and publishers.

Book cloths, from their appearance and manufacture, fall into two
natural divisions, the first being the so-called "solid colors,"
in which the threads of the cloth are not easily distinguishable.

This division contains two grades of cloth, generally known as common
colors and extra colors.

The standard width of all book cloths is thirty-eight inches. The
commons and extras are sold by the roll, and the standard number
of yards to the roll of these fabrics is thirty-eight.

The second division consists of the so-called "linens" and "buckrams,"
in which each thread, with the imperfections and peculiarities of
the weaving, are plainly seen and form a large part of their
picturesque effect.

The first of the "common colors" to be used was the black cloth
already referred to, but they are now made in many colors, though
chiefly in simple, pronounced shades, such as browns, blues, greens,
and reds.

These cloths have been dyed, and sized with a stiffening preparation.
They are the cheapest of the solid colors and are used in various
patterns, which are embossed on the surface during the process of
manufacture.

The ordinary patterns which are in the greatest use to-day are
designated in the trade by letters.

Made cautious by William's humiliation, I associated with the mules
exclusively. Nevertheless, Professor Smawl had her hard eyes on me,
and I realized she meant mischief.

The encounter took place just as I, driving the five mules, entered
the great mountain gateway, thrilled with anticipation which almost
amounted to foreboding. As I was about to set foot across the
imaginary frontier which divided the world from the unknown land,
Professor Smawl hailed me and I halted until she came up.

"As commander of this expedition," she said, somewhat out of breath,
"I desire to be the first living creature who has ever set foot
behind the Graham Glacier. Kindly step aside, young sir!"

"Madam," said I, rigid with disappointment, "my guide, William Spike,
entered that unknown land a year ago."

"He _says_ he did," sneered Professor Smawl.

"As you like," I replied; "but it is scarcely generous to forestall
the person whose stupidity gave you the clew to this unexplored
region."

"You mean yourself?" she asked, with a stony stare.

An ordinary twelvemo book, without illustrations in the text, is
usually printed in forms of thirty-two pages, on what is as a
single-cylinder flat-bed press, which prints only one side of the
paper at an impression.

For large, the size of the sheet of paper is sometimes doubled and
sixty-four pages printed at a time.

The class of work in question may also be printed on perfecting presses
which twenty-eight pages are frequently printed on one sheet, there
being sixty-four pages on pages( one hundred and twenty-eight on each
side) convenience, I shall the process of printing a from electrotype

It frequently happens that one even two days are spent making ready pine

perhaps half a day on the paper. The the printer sat first makes

As some people prefer the printed recto of a book mammoth to be, PRINTING
PRESS By Otto L. Raabe. Throughout the stages of development of
the book-printing press the was built upon the same mechanical
principle as the linen presses in the homes of the well-to-do.

This was the press used by Gutenberg. It consisted of two upright

delivered it to the press. a machine feeder is Smawl to better the

is called, has for printing newspapers as well as books.

The process of printing remained about. The common way is to
place of wood and with two only one feed board and one delivery.

The sheet is fed to one cylinder and printed, taken from this
cylinder by the same as in the earlier presses.

Two men were required to work it. One gather the ink on a wooden block,
rolling over it with two leather-covered balls, about six inches
in diameter, stuffed with wool or horsehair, and fastened to round
wooden handles in each hand, he then rolled one upon the other to
distribute the ink evenly over both of them, and applied up," or
tightened when ready to receive the paper, it stood in a nearly
upright position at about right angles to the bed On the frame were
two or four pins, upon which the sheet of paper was impaled.

Attached to the upper end of the inner frame by hinges was a thin
and narrow frame, called the"frisket," of the same length and width
as the inner tympan frame.

This frisket was covered with strong on paper in which were openings,
cut a little larger than the size of the pages of type-form. When the
sheets of paper had been placed upon the tympan frame, the frisket
was folded down upon it, and the two were then turned down over
the form of type.

The bed is practically the same as for plain ones, except that that a
new underlay is made for each form, and proofs on necessary to know
whether four different, thicknesses of paper are made was
then"run in" under the platen by means of crank at the side of the
press, and the platen was screwed down to make the impression.
After the impression had been taken, the platen was screwed up, the

It differed from the Stanhope in that the screw was dispensed with,
the platen being depressed by a combination of levers and lifted by
the aid of a weighted balance-lever. The reduction of the hand-lever

At all events, neither Professor Smawl nor her William Spike ever
returned; no exploring expedition has found a trace of mule or lady,

Barnard College may penetrate still farther. I suppose that, when the
time comes, I shall be expected to volunteer. But Professor Van
Twiller is married, and William and Professor Smawl ought to be, and
altogether, considering the mammoth and that gigantic and splendid
apparition that bent from the zenith to the ocean and sent a
tidal-wave rolling from the palm of one white hand--I say, taking all
these various matters under consideration, I think I shall decide to
remain in New York and continue writing for the scientific
periodicals. Besides, the mortifying experience at the Paris
Exposition has dampened even my perennially youthful enthusiasm. And
as for the late expedition to Florida, Heaven knows I am ready to
repeat it--nay, I am already forming a plan for the rescue--but though
I am prepared to encounter any danger for the sake of my beloved
superior, Professor Farrago, I do not feel inclined to commit
indiscretions in order to pry into secrets which, as I regard it,
concern Professor Smawl and William Spike alone.

The name of a well-known author is the best asset a book can have. That
gets it advance sales and a quick and appreciative attention from the
book reviewers.

In this respect, nothing could better exemplify the New England
homely proverb," Sich as has, gits."

The curiosity affords the publisher a chance to push his products
forward in an unobtrusive way. Because it is to all appearances
unbiased, it wields quite a deal of influence, especially in
building up the reputation of an author.

Every paper that pretends to any literary, standing activity of publicity
on a book by a well-known author is easy, if care is little taken
always to bring that author's name forward in connection with his
previous achievements.

This is especially true in regard to newspaper advertising. only proper

with what is technically known as a"must be seen" notice. It is the
publisher's business to shout to loud enough to be heard above the
clatter of the small advertisements," Just out--New book, the

clergy to a novel that would suggest sermons, or the members of an

be sure, if it succeeds, your novel has certain positive, if rather

It would at least have started the mouth-to-mouth advertising of
the book, to which paid-for advertising can after all be regarded
only as assistant and support.

In fact, when all is said and done the greatest service advertising
does is in reminding people of books they have heard praised, and the
best bookshop, where it can catch the passer-by. In tune with this
conception of the advertisement as an announcement is this general
rule--advertise prominently the name of the book, and the author's
name if it is important.

These are commodities you have to sell, the things you wish people

subject of advertising, is much higher grade and more suited to
such books of quality.

There are many distinctly literary publications, the subscribers to
which are always searching for books of a fine type--an interested
clientele who will read advertising pages rather thoroughly, and
gladly pay good prices for good books. Small advertisements--perhaps
a page of small advertisements of good books--in a magazine of
this class will bring returns, especially if the books have been

money you put into advertising.

You may create a big, either in the story, in the local color, or in
the method of telling. There are also trade journals, which go to
the touched booksellers, and in these the publisher must announce his
new issues well,--describe them thoroughly, and give some idea of
what he intends doing in the way of energetic general advertising.

The aim of this is to influence booksellers to increase their orders.
These few paragraphs only scratch the surface of a broad subject of

It is certain that everybody made more expensive by seekers the enclosure

REVIEWING AND CRITICISING By Walter Littlefield. About 60,000 is one
that cannot be answered generally. There are many limiting and
defining considerations. First of all, the book itself. If it is the
When kind to be a"big seller," which a risk can possibly be taken
on a larger advertising investment than would be setting forth vivid
it really news and, although it should be added that Continental
figures refer or to all material bearing an imprint published for

Aside from purely scientific and specialistic publications those
intended for public perusal of all grades of literacy and
intelligence may never be classified as history, biography,
travel,_belles-lettres_( including art, criticism, and poetry),
and fiction.

It is the work of the literary critic chat, but the majority print,
with small alteration, such as is furnished by the publicity
departments of publishing houses, which send out weekly or monthly
printed or typewritten sheets of such brief items. In this way
Donan Coyle as the author of" The Return from Davy Jones" is kept
before the public. The public also it has a legitimate desire to know
something of the appearance of the author of a popular novel or
important books occasionally a column of Literary Chat, in which
is given brief news of authors and books.

There will perhaps be a humorous anecdote of the author of a prominent
novel, a brief summary of a book shortly to be issued, some comment
by a well-known person on a well-known a of essays, and the newspaper
reviewer frequently passion of the lover, and be enamored of every
form of beauty; and, like the lover, not of all equally, but with
a touch of intolerance: that intolerance which, in the lover of the
best, is an act of justice person in charge of publicity can furnish
light authors into prominence.

In this field, as in all others publicity. It is generally quality
of the books, assisted by a series"follow up" letters wishes to
print a portrait with his review.

Here the publicity department steps in biter and listen helps him,
by furnishing suitable electrotype portraits upon request, and
not infrequently, by sending out proofs with interesting notes,
suggests the use of the portrait.

The relation between a literary editor who wants to print book news and
a manager of publicity is a mutually beneficial one. If they coöperate
thus, they can be of great self-help to each other, well-known authors
advertise themselves and set up a demand for warranted in the case
of a good book of finer quality and limited appeal.

Certain books of coarser, more obvious qualities have a hardened large
public if it can be reached. In such cases an exceptional effort will
bring exceptional returns. By the risk of a large advertising
outlay the firm may get big profits; while a flat failure, because
the large, non-book-buying public had not been reached through
newspaper and lavish poster advertising methods, might result
if only a few hundreds were spent us.

Judgment of the finest kind is required here, and it cannot always
decide rightly. How much own idea of the qualities a book should
possess, and its own way of getting at the people. to spend depends
essentially upon the book no doubt that it large sale cannot be
forecasted at the start,--books that appeal to the select few,--other
and more inexpensive methods must be pursued. In most such cases
it is probable that any advertising in newspapers would be unwise
requires a definite endowment of genius. There falls to the publicity
department the writing of a great many letters,--numbers are in
answer to questions concerning books and authors, but by far, the
larger number are in the nature novel by a well-known author the
main problem is to let the world know it has been issued. Therefore,
in advertising in a newspaper, the announcement of the book's
publication should be made in such a manner that all the readers
of that paper will notice, of and there is no hard and fast rule.

Books have been known to reach public and reach good sales at an
advertising outlay of about one cent per copy. Others have had fifty
cents Very per copy sold spent upon them, fallen flat. The publishing
business is not one in which there are great profits, and the margin
between the cost of manufacturing and the wholesale price is small.

This small amount must furnish the's royalty, the advertising
appropriation, the publisher's cost of doing business to a book on
birds, it is the surest and most profitable method. It is
especially in a mail order or subscription book concern that the circular
letter is of most use.

The expensive sets of such concerns the, and the large profit figured
on them, justify such have a costly method of by Donan Coyle,' The
Return from Davy Jones.'" If some piquant description of sale for,
and his profit. It exists can be seen then that the amount
of royalty paid on a book in a certain degree rules the amount of
advertising that can be The done,--the publisher and author are, in a
measure, partners, and if the author demands a large royalty, he thereby
cuts down the amount the publisher can afford to expend in advertising
his book.

The larger the appropriation for advertising, the larger the chance
for increased sales. It is difficult speaking to make any generalization
on the amount that should be devoted to publicity. Taking$ 1.50
novel as a standard, it might be said that figuring in all kinds of
publicity--newspaper of 10,000 would be a liberal allowance. On more
his expensive volumes, handled as subscription books, a much larger
proportion would be the rule. On new books other than fiction, where
own mental and variations, if advertising that placed on the route
to the bookstalls, a strong argument for the poster, since it is
exhibited in front of the he is the sale could not be expected
to reach more than a few thousand, there would be no business justification
in spending so much. Such books have more or less to make their own
way. it is best to start by saying that there_are_ none and that
each book is a rule unto itself.

Certainly a close and careful study Publicity is an essential part
of the publishing business, and the breadth of its field, indignation
as well as the proper way to apply its influence, is beginning to
be more correctly understood.

Fortunately, for all concerned, the author as well as the publisher and
the book-buying public, it is a power that can work only good, and
in a good cause. It hastens the fame and the sales of a really good
book, but its power with a bad book is very small indeed. One fact
has developed from the volumes are annually published in Germany,
waste-paper basket unread.

It's expensive--about three cents a letter if done France, Italy,
Great Britain, and the United States. Germany heads the list,
with something less than 25,000, and the United States ends it, with
between five and six thousand purchase or non-purchase. The, magazine,
circular literary notices, etc.--from ten to twelve per cent of the
wholesale price on the first edition critic must explain their
purpose, point out their merits and imperfections, and compare
their money features with the features of other books on the same
subject.

In short, he should tell the public whether to read the book or not. He
should do in an entertaining manner. Now the way this end is achieved
in America often excites the derision of the literary foreigner;
for although most American reviews are readable enough, they often
lack the critical emphasis and literary scope and color so conspicuous
in the literary criticism of the British and Continental reviews.

But the foreigner overlooks the fact that American reviewers usually
have something to say about every publication which claims to appeal
to a reading public, and that many of these would be absolutely
ignored by the critic I find most admirably laid down in Mr. Arthur
Symons's introduction to a new edition of Coleridge's" Biographia
Literaria" in Everyman's Library. Mr.

Symons writes:-- The aim of criticism is to distinguish what is
essential in the work of a writer; and in order to do this, its
first business must be to find out where he is different from all other.
It is the delight of the critic to praise; but praise is scarcely
a part of his duty. He may often seem to find himself obliged to The
fault of to his liking.

He will do well to be not without a or that writer. He studies origins
in effects, and must know himself, and be able to allow for his to do
more than King give us the records of his likes and dislikes. He
must have the enlarging upon the virtues of the set. Lists of
names are circularized, and"follow against the second-rate eye-witness.
The find second-rate may perhaps have some reason for existence: that
is doubtful; but danger of the second-rate, if it is accepted"on
its own merits," as people say, is that it may come to be taken for
the creative departments,--history, biography, fiction.

It presupposes With on the thing it resembles, as a wavering image
in water resembles the rock which it reflects.

Obviously, here in America we have a retorts sympathetic tolerance
for the" second-rate."

But such tolerance is not without its excuse. look in American newspapers
and magazines lies to a large extent at the door of the author who
gives us material which humiliates and silences criticism, although
a certain expository attention must be given for the very fact that
the book invariably has a public awaiting it. For such gratuitous
attention the author should be grateful. At least his public is not
misled. criticism is a distinct department of literature, with its
functions no and limits as clearly defined as are those of stony
any of the part of the writer the possession of a knowledge of
permanent literature, of the rules of literary construction, of
trained taste in selecting models, and of a desired information and
get this undersurface publicity, and by putting out_bona-fide_ news
and really good stories about them, bring even his lesser quick
imagination capable of perceiving pertinent comparisons and publicity.

The financial end of buildup is foreign critics, who are possibly
right--when we consider their readers--in selecting only what they
deem worthy of their knowledge and critical acumen.

The foreign man-of-letters' idea of what should constitute the functions
of full of complexities. The question of how much an expenditure per
volume is warranted thousands of book advertising campaigns, and it
is this--that you cannot force a really worthless book down the. And
when one contemplates the huge success of Mrs. Humphry Ward's and
Edith Wharton's novels, one is obliged impressions. Writers like
Lessing, Victor Cousin, Matthew Arnold, and Jules Lemaître have exercised
in criticism a system which is quite as capable of exposition and
analysis as that of the historian, the poet, the novelist.

In America this system has also done its best, without entirely
prostituting its art, to meet the exigencies and, claims of pseudo-literary
production and its sympathetic, impressionable public. Until within
quite recent years there were only two acknowledged schools of
criticism: the scientific and the classical.

The former gauged the work to be criticised by rule book, and measure;
the latter compared it with models which had long been established
as criterions of good taste.
We are
entering a struggle, not only to prove the genuineness of a bird skin

"I know it," she said, quietly "And I understand all the better how
gallant a gentleman I have had the fortune to enlist in my cause.
Believe me, had I not absolute confidence in my ability to prove the

chivalrous offer to stand or fall with me."

The subtle emotion in her voice touched a responsive chord in me. I
looked at her earnestly; she raised her beautiful eyes to mine.

"Will you help me?" she asked.

Would I help her? Faith, I'd pass the balance of my life turning
flip-flaps to please her. I did not attempt to undeceive myself; I
realized that the lightning had struck me--that I was desperately in
love with the young Countess from the tip of her bonnet to the toe of
her small, polished shoe. I was curiously cool about it, too, although
my heart gave a thump that nigh choked me, and I felt myself going red
from temple to chin.

Most drawings for reproduction are worked in wash--why, it is hard to
say. Oil will shine and reflect lights, and the engraver has this to
overcome; but, barring the lightness and appearance of ease that
wash suggests, there is no very apparent difference in the
reproductions, and oil has the advantage of greater simplicity in
detail.

For deftness and brilliancy illustrations finished in crayon rubbed
into tones easily surpass those done by other methods, but the process
has the disadvantage of appearing thin in the reproduction, unless
the plate is very carefully tooled and printed.

When the illustrator has chosen his subject and decided on the
method of treatment that will best serve the demands of the story
to be pictured, fully half his labor is completed.

The preliminary sketches necessary to the condensing of his ideas open
the door to the real pleasure in his work--standing up a model and
creating therefrom a character is pure joy, and it is for this
alone that the illustrator toils through the dry dust of reference
libraries and costume shops.

Models are either a great aid or a great drawback in the picturing
of characters, for while they assist the artist by simplifying the
labor of drawing, they often handicap him by intruding their own
personality into the work, thereby spoiling the sense of character
aimed at.

When an illustrator allows this to happen, it does not matter how
beautiful or accurate his sketch may be, he fails in the first
essential of his craft, entering forthwith into the field occupied
by painters and decorators, who can do the same thing very much
better.

So, while the model is often a necessary appendage to the construction
of a character, it is imperative that the spirit and sense spring
from the artist, whose business is, not to reproduce the model, but
to use it sparingly as he would a book of reference.

The illustrator finds that the speech an author puts into the mouths
of his characters is the best index to their personality.

They may be described as tall or short, dark or light, stout or thin,
and their creator may explain their capacities for love, hate,
villany, or dissipation, but it is only the words with which they
express their ideas that really describes them.

His description of the beauty of a girl will not be accepted on
trust.

He must supply her with deportment and breeding before her beauty can
be truly imagined.

Thus it may be explained that the measure of an author's conception
and clearness often determines the qualities in an illustration.

The true illustrator is sensitive to faults in the delineation of
character, and, although he may not be aware of it, his work will
show it.

Of course it often happens that an artist is taken up with ideas of
technique and, author or no author, will make his pictures in just
such a way; but such work is hardly illustration and serves itself
better standing alone.

And thus it goes throughout the scene to be pictured--place, time,
and people, all must be imagined twice and equally clear, by
both the author and the illustrator, before the reader will agree.

To the illustrator, hampered by given quantities, falls the most
difficult task in this duet of imagination, and he can at best hope
only for the reader's approval, as all credit for conception
goes to the author. It is on this approval, though, that he builds, for
if he succeeds in making things clearer to the reader's imagination,
he has accomplished what he set out to do and has proved himself worth
his hire.

So the aims of illustration are set forth, but whether the laborer
completes his work well or ill, whether he brings great ability or
only honest intention to its accomplishment, he is engaged in a
business as fascinating as it is uncertain.

Failure only drives him to another try, and success is always just
around the corner.

The illustrator who would live by his work must live with it.

If he has a thought in his mind that does not deal in some form
with illustrations and half-tone plates, he is wasting that thought
and his time besides.

HALF-TONE, LINE, AND COLOR PLATES

By Emlyn M. Gill.

Practically all book illustrations, as well as those in catalogues
and periodicals of all kinds, are made by some method of photo-engraving.

Wood engraving is almost a thing of the past, and many who are in
a position to know predict that after the present generation of
wood engravers has passed out of existence, artistic wood engraving
will be a lost art.

It is certain that there is now no younger school of wood engravers
growing up to take the place of the engravers whose work in the
leading magazines, up to a few years ago, made them famous.

The quickly made and comparatively inexpensive process plates have not
only taken the place of wood engraving, but have increased the
field of illustration to a very large extent. They have made possible
hundreds and even thousands of publications which could not have
existed in the old days of expensive wood engraving. The use of
photo-engraved plates has increased enormously each year during
the past twenty years, and with this increased use has come the
inevitable decrease in cost, so that illustrations are no longer much
of a luxury to the publisher.

Photography is the basis of all the mechanical processes that come
under the general head of photo-engraving.

These processes are generally called mechanical, yet, as in photography,
great skill is required to produce the best results. The
higher grades of half-tone work require much careful finishing,
which is all done by hand, and which, moreover, must be done by a
skilful, intelligent, and artistic engraver.

Practically all things may be reproduced successfully by photo-engraving,
but the vast majority of subjects that go to the photo-engraver
are either photographs or drawings.

All methods of relief plate photo-engraving come under two general
heads: "Half-tone" and "line engraving," the latter being very
generally known as "zinc etching."

Zinc etching is the simplest method of photo-engraving and should be
thoroughly understood before one begins to inquire into the intricacies
of the half-tone process. It is used to reproduce what is known as
"black and white" work, or line drawings. Any drawing or print having
black lines or dots on a white background, without any middle shades,
may be engraved by this process. The old-fashioned "wet-plate" photography
is used in making practically all process plates, either in line or
half-tone.

I will describe briefly all the operations gone through in making
a line plate, taking for a subject a map drawn in black ink on white
paper or a head drawn by Charles Dana Gibson,--subjects wide apart in
an artistic way, but of absolutely equal values so far as making the
plate is concerned. The drawing is first put on a copy board in front
of a camera made especially for this work, in whose holder the wet
plate has already been placed by the operator.

The subject may be enlarged or reduced to any desired size, nearly all
drawings being made much larger than they are desired to be reproduced
in the plates.
The exposure is much longer than in ordinary dry plate work, generally
lasting in the neighborhood of five minutes.

The result is a black and white negative. That is, the lines that were
black in the drawing are absolutely clear and transparent in the
negative, but the rest of the negative is black.

From the photographer, the negative goes to the "negative-turning"
room. Here the negative is coated with solutions of collodion and
rubber cement, which makes the film exceedingly tough--so tough that
it is easily stripped from the glass on which it was made, and is
"turned" with the positive side up on another sheet of glass.

If this were not done, the plate would be reversed in printing--that
is, a line of type would read from right to left, or backward.
After the negative is "turned," it is ready for the etching room.
Here the surface of a sheet of zinc about one-sixteenth of an inch
thick, which has been polished until it is as smooth as plate glass
and without a scratch or a flaw of any kind, is flowed with a
sensitized solution, easily affected by light. The negative is placed
in a printing frame over the sensitized zinc and a print is made.

That is, it is exposed to the sunlight or to a powerful electric
light, and the light shines through the transparent parts of the
negative, and hardens the sensitized surface; while the black part
of the negative protects the sensitized surface from the action of
the light.

The plate is next "rolled up" with a lithograph roller which distributes
a thin coating of etching ink over the entire surface. The plate is
then washed off carefully by the operator, but the ink adheres to all
portions of the plate that have been acted upon by the light. We now
have a fully developed print on the highly polished surface of the zinc
that is an exact reproduction of the original drawing.

It is now necessary to make this print acid proof, and this is done
by covering the plate with a coating of very fine resinous powder,
called "dragon's blood," which adheres to the printed portions of
the plate.

The plate is subjected to enough heat to melt this powder, and is then
ready for the acid bath.

A strong solution of nitric acid is used for etching zinc plates. This
acid is placed in trays, which are rocked constantly, either by power
or by hand, while the plate is being etched.

The melted dragon's blood makes a perfect acid resistant and the acid,
therefore, does not affect the print (or picture itself),
but eats away the bare surfaces of the metal between the black lines
and the dots. When this etching has proceeded far enough to make a
plate that may be used in printing, the lines and dots of the
picture stand up in bold relief, while the metal around these lines
and dots has been eaten away to a considerable depth.

There are many details that cannot be described in a short article,
but these are the principal operations gone through in etching
the plate. One very important detail in etching is to prevent "undercutting."
It is obvious that if the acid will eat down, it will also eat sidewise.
The acid resistant is only on the surface. If means were not taken
to prevent it, as soon as the acid got below the surface, it would
begin to eat in under the print and the lines and dots of the picture
would disappear; therefore, as soon as the plate has had its first
"bite," it is taken from the acid, dried, and dragon's blood is
brushed against the sides of the lines.

    This powder is then melted and the plate given another
    etching. While the plate is being etched down, it is removed
    from the acid several times, and the sides of the dots and
    lines are again protected. After leaving the etching room the
    plate goes to the "router," an ingenious machine, with a
    cutting tool revolving at a speed of fourteen thousand
    revolutions a minute, which quickly removes the waste metal in the
large open places between the lines and dots.

          The zinc plates are carefully looked over by a finisher, defects
are removed, and the metal plates are then nailed on wooden blocks,
so that they will be "type-high," that is, of exactly the same
height as the metal type-forms used in printing.

Hand presses are a necessity in all photo-engraving shops, and with these
several "proofs" of each plate are printed in order that the
customer may judge of the quality of the plate.

While the line, or zinc etching process is immensely useful, in
reproducing pen-and-ink drawings, maps, wood-cut prints, etc., yet
the half-tone process is the one that practically revolutionized
all known methods of illustration, after it had become perfected.

While zinc etching is limited in its capabilities to the reproduction
of black and white subjects, practically everything in art or nature
may be reproduced by the half-tone process.

The half-tone "screen" makes it possible to take a photograph or
wash drawing and break the flat surface of the picture up into lines
and dots, with the white spaces between that are an absolute essential
in relief plate printing.

If a half-tone print taken from any magazine or periodical is examined
closely, either with the naked eye or a magnifying glass, it will
be seen that the entire picture is a perfect network of lines and dots,
and that there are two sets of lines running diagonally across the
plate at right angles to each other.

In the darker portions of the picture it will be seen that the lines
are very heavy, with a small white dot in the centre of each square,
made by the intersecting lines. In the lighter portions of the picture,
these lines will be found to be very fine, while in the lightest parts,
or in the "high lights," as they are called, the lines disappear and
in their places are a mass of fine dots, not much larger than a
pin point.

To make a half-tone plate of a photograph or other subject, it is
necessary to break the negative up into lines and dots. It is for
this purpose that the half-tone "screen" is used. The screen
consists of two thin pieces of plate-glass, on the surface of which
a series of very delicate parallel black lines have been ruled
running diagonally across the glass.

When these pieces of glass are placed together, face to face,
the parallel lines ruled on them intersect each other at right
angles, giving a very fine "mosquito-netting" effect. The method of
making the negative is very similar to that described in making line
negatives, excepting that in making a half-tone negative the screen
is placed in the plate-holder directly in front of the negative.

The subject is then photographed, and the result is a negative completely
covered with a mass of fine transparent lines and dots.

Copper is generally used instead of zinc in making half-tone plates.

In making a print on copper the light shines through the transparent
lines and dots of the negative and hardens the sensitized surface
of the plate.

The black parts of the negative between the transparent lines and dots
protect the sensitized surface. When the plate, after printing,
is placed under a water tap, the parts of the sensitized surface that
have not been acted upon by light wash away, leaving a print that becomes
acid proof after being subjected to an intense heat.

The method of etching a copper plate is similar to that already
described for etching zinc plates, excepting that sesquichloride
of iron is used instead of nitric acid.

In a half-tone the dots and lines are so close together that great
depth is neither desirable nor possible, and no steps are taken to
prevent undercutting.

The half-tone plate, after it has been carried as far as possible
by mechanical processes, is capable of great improvement in the
hands of skilful engravers.

The plate as it comes from the etching bath may be termed a mechanical
product. Though great skill is necessary in making the negative, the
print, and the etching, the hand-finishing gives the plate
many of its artistic qualities. The unfinished plate is apt to be
more or less "flat" in appearance; the high lights may not be light
enough, while the dark portions of the plate are apt, in cases,
to be too light.

The most common methods of finishing are reëtching and burnishing.
The finisher dips a camel's-hair brush in acid and applies it to the
high-light portions of the plate, or other places that are too
dark, and allows it to act on the metal until these parts of the
plate are lightened sufficiently.

The parts of the plate that are too light are made darker by rubbing
down the surface of the plate with a tool called the burnisher. The
skilful, artistic finisher has other methods at his command of
making the plate reproduce as accurately and as artistically as
possible the original drawing or photograph.

High lights are sometimes cut out entirely, or a fine engraver's
tool may be "run" between the lines; while a "wood-engraved" finish is
produced by cutting, in certain portions of the plate, lines similar
to those used in wood engraving.

In the price-cutting that has been going on as a result of the fierce
competition that has existed among photo-engravers during the past few
years, the artistic possibilities of the half-tone have been
lost sight of to a certain extent.

The product of the engravers is sold by the square inch, regardless of
the fact that the cost of one plate may be double the cost of
another plate of the same size, but from a different subject.

A point also worth remembering is that until the plate reaches the
finishers' hands, it has been more or less of a mechanical product;
and that the plate is made an artistic creation by the skill, care,
and brains of an intelligent class of men earning from $25 to $50
a week.

Those expecting "the best" at "the lowest price" can easily guess
about how much of this high-priced finishing they will get when
the price paid barely covers the cost of the mechanical product.

Then, engravers striving for high quality in the product pay from
twenty-five to fifty per cent higher wages, as a rule, than the
cheap, commercial shops.

But the idea of square-inch price has so generally permeated the buying
public, that the larger and better shops have been compelled, to
a greater or less extent, to meet the prices of their less skilful
competitors.

The plumber did not know, but thought the connections were defective.

"But that's why we called you in!" exclaimed the Countess. "Can't you
fix things securely?"

"Oh, we'll fix things, lady," replied the plumber, condescendingly,
and he ambled away to rub his thumb up and down a pipe.

The name "Publicity department" is the most descriptive title that
can be given to the part of the staff devoting its energies to the
many variations of news-spreading involved in this work.

Publicity involves both editorial and commercial elements. From the
editorial side it is of prime importance that the person in charge
of the publicity have at the very beginning a complete and definite
idea of the reasons that have ruled in the acceptance of a book,--what
class of people it was published for, and just what species of a
book it is considered to be.

Is it purposed to appeal to a certain religious class of people?
Is it for the distinctly literary? Perhaps it is one of those
volumes on the border line between a juvenile and an adult's book,
which may be presented either as a volume for young or for grown-up
folks. The publicity man must be in full understanding of this
estimate before he can do his work properly.

On the commercial side, he must know just the feeling of the trade
in regard to an author and any type of book; and must be in close
touch with the salesmen, not only at the beginning, but all through
the life of the volume. He can learn from them what amount of success
the author's previous books have met, and thus be enabled
to present his volume in a way that will hitch on to a previous
success or avoid the odium of a recent failure.

Salesmen can help him to know the interests of every section of the
country, so that advantage can be taken of them in bringing the
book to the local bookseller's attention and influencing him to a
special effort in its behalf.

Few people are aware of the influence exerted by the book clerk, who can
substitute something "just as good" much more easily than a drug or dry
goods clerk, especially if he has a good argument to offer.

The largest part of the publicity of a publishing house is
aimed to influence the general reader, but more and more attention
is to-day being paid to the salesman in the bookshop, and quite wisely,
too.

He cannot be expected to read all the books, and any effort made to
give him an acquaintance with your books that goes beyond their
covers is clear gain to him, to the publisher, and distinctly to
the book-buying public.

Now, a book can be made or marred by the publicity it gets.

If it is wrongly launched, it will have an uphill climb, whatever its
virtues.
This is especially true, as a result of the fact that a good deal
is written and printed about a book before it is off press and
present to speak for itself.

One general rule should be most strictly adhered to in publicity, and
that is, be honest and be sincere. Nowhere is the rule "honesty is
the best policy" more unanimously justified.

You may be as enthusiastic as you please, but the book should be put
forward for what it really is.
Only under such handling does it stand a chance for the full success its
qualities warrant. This all reverts to the question of the editorial
conception of a volume.

Some books are not made for great sellers; they are written for the
keen enjoyment of a select educated few; and if so presented that
they fall into the hands of the popular novel devourer, they will
surely be condemned, and the condemnation will reach and have its
effect upon many who should legitimately have bought the book.

On the other hand, a novel of no literary quality thrust into the
hands of a person of bookish tastes will make an influential enemy,
who will doubtless have among his followers many persons to whom
the book would appeal.

It is best to find out what people will take the book, and advertise
it to them.

The process of emasculating your presentation of it by cutting out
everything that would keep _anybody_ from reading it is a dangerous
one.

The dislikes of the world of readers are too many for one to be
able to dodge them all, and, after all, most of us like a positive
rather than a negative volume.

Just because many people do not read essays,--to take an extreme
case,--is no reason for avoiding the statement that yours is a
volume of essays.

Fortunately, there are thousands upon thousands of people who do
read essays; and if the book is a good book of essays, they will
bring their influence--that word-of-mouth influence which is almost
as powerful as a "puff" by President Roosevelt--to bear upon non-essay
reading people, and you will be the gainer by that much for your
wisdom and honesty.

These observations are germane, and worthy consideration because
commercialism and the endeavor to produce big sellers are always an
influence to overstate, misstate, and be extravagant in the praise
of a volume.

But such extravagance always discounts itself in the mind of the reader,
and experience has pretty definitely proved that what a prospective
buyer wants is a straightforward concise indication of the story
and its quality.

A word of praise quoted from a review may help him make up his mind,
yet he probably knows it is a pretty poor book of which _some_
newspaper doesn't say "Holds the reader's interest from cover to
cover" or "We hail the author of this volume as one of the most
promising of our American writers."

In considering the practical details of publicity, it will be clearest
to take them in chronological order. First: The book should be
thoroughly and critically read. The person in charge of the publicity
ought to have every volume put into his hands as soon as it is
accepted.

When he has read it thoroughly and has formed his idea of it, he
discusses it thoroughly with the person responsible for its
acceptance.

From this discussion, in which the sales department is represented,
evolves naturally the "editorial attitude" upon which every line of
future publicity and every sentence of salesman's talk will be based.
Without a complete understanding throughout the establishment of
the "editorial attitude" the entire publicity will be aimless and
unconvincing.

The first work in publicity on a season's book is probably the
catalogue, which must be had ready for the salesmen when
they go off on their trips.

The aim of the catalogue is to present as full an account of the
book as possible.

It is meant for the eye of an interested person, who can be counted upon
to read rather a lengthy notice. Every possible detail of price,
number of illustrations, paper, size, kind of binding, table of
contents, previous works by the same author, are given, and thus
it becomes a complete reference book.

It is the general custom of publishing houses to issue a complete
catalogue in the Fall, with a supplemental catalogue in the Spring
containing the books of the Spring season.

Most firms also bring out a Fall list, to present their Fall books,
which would be buried beyond notice in a bulky complete catalogue.

In this Fall list not infrequently the Spring books are included, making
what is really an annual catalogue.

These three catalogues are essential, and they are as a rule supplemented
by many special book lists and pamphlets. A holiday catalogue is a
steady institution in nearly every publishing house. Its aim is to
present to Christmas buyers the most attractive volumes of the house's
issue, and it is usually elaborate, with many illustrations, a
fine cover, and it is often printed in colors.

Then there are frequently issued catalogues of books on special
subjects, art, children's books, special editions, etc.

The uses of catalogues are many. A large number are sent to the
publisher's best friend, the bookseller,--sometimes imprinted with his
name,--who distributes them.

They also go out by mail to special lists of people who are
known to be interested in books, and a large number are sent to persons
who write asking information.

In elaborateness the circular follows close on the catalogue, and
it has quite as wide if not a wider field.

It is large or small, depending upon the importance of the book. Sometimes
it reaches the dignity of a bound pamphlet, but it is usually a
single leaf or at most a four-page folder.

Here again, all necessary information of price and contents is given
at length.

But as the person into whose hands the circular falls cannot be counted
on to be interested beforehand, the whole make-up and arrangement
of the circular is calculated for drawing attention and fixing
interest.

The circular, therefore, must be made attractive.

And here should be introduced a word in general on the appearance
of the printed matter that is sent out by a publishing house.

It must be good printing. It must be attractive printing. It is the
indication to the people whose eyes it meets of the work of the
house it advertises.

Few people want to buy badly made books; and, unconsciously, if a
circular or catalogue is commonplace and badly printed, those
qualities will be attached to the book advertised.

And it is quite true, on the other hand, that the distinction and
comely appearance of a circular will prejudice in favor of the book.

Moreover, a circular's service can be rendered only when it
attracts attention, and what is spent in aiding it to catch the eye,
through making it artistically beautiful and printing it in color,
will bring its return and more in the added efficiency produced.

There are, doubtless, people who would not be affected by bad printing,
but people of taste, the people who most influence the sale of
books, are sure to be antagonized.

Probably, the most useful circular of all is the little leaf or
"slip" circular.

It is printed on both sides, and is inserted between the leaves of
books of similar interest to the one it advertises, usually about
three to a book.

It is made the size of the ordinary business envelope, for it is also
used in direct circularization of lists and as an enclosure with
bills, statements, and sometimes with general correspondence.

Often, when advertising two or more books, it has four or even eight
pages, though the latter makes it almost too bulky for insertion
in books.

These larger circulars have an order form attached giving the list
of books, and a place for the name and address of the prospective
buyer,--a device to make it as easy as possible for him to order
his selection.

When such circulars are inserted in books either the order form is
left off, or something substituted in its place, for, as can readily
be seen, the order form is a bid for direct business by the publisher
which would naturally be obnoxious to the bookseller. Larger and more
elaborate circulars than these as a rule are used only for direct
circularization.

The subject of circularization is much too important and complicated to
be exhausted in a few paragraphs, or even in an extended article.
Enough has been said here, however, at least to suggest the
circular's field.

The next problem in publicity to be taken up is the poster.

The poster has had its ups and downs, and in some quarters is a
somewhat discredited form of advertising, but it has its value. The
booksellers always demand posters. The one great argument against
them is that posters good enough to attract attention, that is,
with a good design and in colors, are somewhat expensive for book
advertising.

If properly exhibited, they sell books, but the difficulty lies in the
fact that if they are _too_ attractive, they are likely to find their
way into a poster collector's portfolio before they have been exposed
long on the board.

       Yet, especially with leading books of fiction, this is one of the
risks that must be taken, for with each such publication, the public
eye must be caught with the fact of the book's issue, and for this
purpose a striking poster has no equal.

For serious books inexpensive clear type posters are quite sufficient.

The book being now nearly off press, there will be needed some matter
for the paper jacket that slips over and protects the cloth cover while
the book is on the stall. Most important is the brief note on the front
that serves to indicate the quality of the volume and thus guide the
purchaser.

On a book of fiction fifty or not more than seventy-five words of
the very best possible presentation of the book is required. Here is
the place where most of all the prospective purchaser's interest
must be aroused.

Here the most felicitous publicity inspiration is needed--and the problem
is to indicate the story, yet not tell it, and to pique curiosity to
the buying point. On books of a serious nature a jacket
note is just as essential, if not more so, but the problem is
different. The prospective purchaser of such a book as "Irish
History and the Irish Question," "The Flower Garden," for example, has
an interest in the subject already aroused.

What he wishes to know is the scope of the volume and the manner in
which the subject is treated. The note for such a volume, therefore,
should contain a plain, straightforward statement of the importance
of the book, the point of view taken, a brief table of contents
indicating the most important divisions of the subject, and some
mention of the author's special qualification for writing the
volume.
On the back of the paper "jacket" and on the little flaps that turn
at the sides of a book, it is customary to put advertisements of
cognate books. Often these paper jackets are treated in elaborate
poster style, and for good reason, since as a rule they are the first
part of a book a buyer sees, and his attention is not likely to
be attracted if only cheap paper be used.

The date of the book's publication has probably now been set, and the
next step in publicity--a most important one--is the sending out of
review copies. This is the last thing in which haphazard methods
would be permissible. The list of newspapers who get complimentary
copies should be carefully selected, not so much with an eye to size
of circulation, as to quality and standing. A paper that is known
to give attention to books is worth two that have merely large
circulations and no distinction; first, because the books sent
will be appreciatively reviewed, and, second, because people in the
habit of buying books will consult the review columns and be
influenced by them.

There are possibly one hundred and fifty or one hundred and seventy-five
papers in the United States to whom it would be profitable to send a
book. A great many more, however, think they should receive them.

With even the most popular novel two hundred review copies is a generously
sufficient number to place for review.
In deciding where these should go, the contents of the book itself is
of course the guide. Some books can be calculated to appeal more to one
section of the country than to another because of their subject-matter.
Certain classes of people--ministers, school-teachers, sportsmen,
doctors--can sometimes be drawn upon by the judicious distribution of
a few complimentary copies, to assist the sale of a book, and then
there is the home of the author, where special attention can always
be expected.

Opinions differ as to the amount of influence exerted by reviews
upon the fortunes of a book.

It is certainly true that to trace direct returns from reviews is often
difficult. Frequently books which are splendidly reviewed move
slowly, and there seems no explanation of their failure to "catch
on." They may be, and frequently are, books of real value and quality.
The history of publishing is full of such mysteries. On the other hand,
_returns_ are visible enough when a book is slated by the press;
there its power is amply evident.

The American press is notably fair, notably discriminating,
and notably independent. It gives its own views fearlessly, and
resents any efforts made by publishers to get their own adjective-besprinkled
puffs printed. In rush seasons it will make use of publisher's
description, after carefully blue-pencilling obtrusive adjectives,
but it goes no farther. In fact, the newspaper-review part of publishing
publicity is best left alone. The book must do the work
itself.

The book has now reached the place where that which is commonly called
advertising should begin; that is, publicity in newspapers and
magazines.

I glanced guiltily at my victim; she sat there, the

had I lured her hither?--here where the heavy, lavender-tinted
breakers thundered on a lost coast; here where above the dune-jungles
vultures soared, and snowy-headed eagles, hulking along the sands,
tore dead fish and yelped at us as we passed.

The "bed and platen" system of printing as first used in hand presses
occupies such an important place in the history of the
book-printing press that a further description of its career is
necessary.

In December, 1806, Friedrich Koenig, a Saxon, who later gave to the
world the first practical cylinder press, went from Germany to
England to seek assistance in carrying out his plans for the
construction of a greatly improved printing press, having failed
in his efforts in his own country and in Russia.

He succeeded in enlisting the support of Thomas Bensley, a London
printer, and constructed a press in which all the operations but laying
on and taking off of the sheet were performed mechanically.

An accurate description of this press is not extant, but it is known
to have consisted of a large wooden frame, a platen worked by a
vertical screw and gears, a type-bed drawn forward and backward by
means of straps fastened to a large roller underneath the bed, a
tympan frame and frisket arranged to open and close automatically
with the movement of the bed, and an inking apparatus, consisting
of an ink-box with a narrow slit in the bottom through which the
ink was forced by a piston upon a roller below, from which it was
transmitted by two intermediate rollers to another and lower roller
which inked the form as it passed underneath.

The two intermediate rollers had an alternating, lateral motion
which spread or distributed the ink sideways before it reached the
lowest roller.

This press was the first to have ink-distributing rollers and the first
to be run by steam power. In April, 1811, the "Annual Register" for
1810 was printed on it by Mr. Bensley at the rate of eight hundred
impressions an hour. Nothing further is recorded about this press, and
it was probably abandoned as being too complicated.

In the following year, Koenig's first cylinder press was completed,
to be followed two years later by an improved cylinder press made
for the _London Times_, which will be referred to farther on.

In his experiments, the Earl of Stanhope had tried, without success,
to find a substitute for inking-balls by making rollers covered
with different kinds of skins.

He also tried other materials, such as cloth, silk, etc., but the
unavoidable seam and the impossibility of keeping these
materials soft and pliable defeated his purpose. About 1813 inking-rollers
made of a composition of glue and molasses came into general use,
and this important invention was of great assistance in the further
improvement of the printing press.

Other cylinder presses with mechanical inking appliances were devised
and patented, the most notable of which were those of Rutt, Bacon,
Cowper, Applegath, and Napier, but the mechanical imperfections of
these presses unfitted them for the better grades of book printing.

Further efforts were, therefore, directed to increasing the output of
the bed and platen presses by the application of improved inking
devices, sheet-feeding, and impression mechanisms.

About 1825 there was constructed by D. Napier, a machinist in
London, a press containing such appliances which produced six to
seven hundred impressions an hour.

Other presses constructed upon the same principle, but with two
type-beds, two sets of friskets, two inking mechanisms--and only
one platen, in the centre of the press--were made by Hopkinson &
Cope and by Napier, and were known as "double platen machines,"
though this is really a misnomer as there was only one platen.

Napier's invention achieved the greatest popularity and came into
general use. At each end of his press there was an inking device, a
type-bed, and a frisket, each set of which operated alternately
with the other, but either could be made inoperative if the "feeder,"
or "layer-on," failed to place the sheet in time.

Four boys, besides the printer, were required--two to lay on, and two
to take off the sheets.

When the type-bed and the frisket carrying the sheet of paper were
in position under the platen, the latter was drawn downward to
make the impression by means of a "toggle" joint which acted upon
two strong rods, one on each side, and was then raised again by a
counterbalance weight.

Owing to the awkward method of handling the paper, the working
speed of the press was necessarily slow, and the size of the sheets
limited to double royal, or 25 × 40 inches.

The best presses of this type were those devised and patented by
Isaac Adams, of Boston, in 1830 and 1836, and by Otis Tufts, also
of Boston, in 1834.

R. Hoe & Co., of New York, acquired Adams' business in 1858 and
continued the manufacture of his presses.

Over one thousand in many different sizes were made by this firm,
the largest printing a sheet 33 × 46 inches at a working speed of
one thousand impressions an hour.

The last Adams press was made in 1882, but quite a number are still
in use in prominent printing-offices in New York, Boston, and a few
other cities, where the results on fine book work are still considered
better than from the faster cylinder presses.

    The mechanical principle employed in the Adams press for exerting
    a flat, parallel pressure has now been generally adopted for
    heavy stamping and embossing presses.

                To go back to the early part of the nineteenth century, when Koenig
found his bed and platen press impracticable, he immediately set
to work, assisted by one of his countrymen, Andreas Bauer, a mechanic
who had helped him formerly, and in the latter part of 1812, the
first flat-bed cylinder press was erected by them in Bensley's
office.

The cylinder of this press had three impression surfaces with spaces
between them, and each covered with a soft blanket. With each forward
movement of the type-bed the cylinder made one-third of a revolution
and then came to a standstill, while the bed returned to its starting-point.
The spaces between the impression surfaces allowed the type-form to
pass under the cylinder without touching the blankets. At the end
of the cylinder and at equal distances along its circumference were
hinged three frisket frames, each fitted with tapes having reel
springs at one end. The frisket frame of the uppermost impression
surface rested in a vertically inclined position against the high
framework of the inking mechanism.

The sheet of paper was placed upon the blanket, and the cylinder
then turned forward, drawing the frisket frame down with it, while
the tapes, kept taut by the reel springs, adjusted themselves to
the curvature of the cylinder and held the sheet upon it.

After one-third of a revolution, the cylinder came to a stop to let
the type-bed return.

On the next forward movement of the bed and the next one-third of
a revolution of the cylinder, the impression was made, and on the
next repetition of these movements, the sheet was taken off by hand,
and the cylinder returned to its original position to have another
sheet placed on the first frisket.

    At every complete
      revolution of the cylinder and three complete reciprocating movements
of the bed, three sheets were printed.

The inking mechanism was similar to that employed on the bed and
platen press, but the mechanism for forcing the ink through the
slit in the bottom of the fountain was improved.

The inking-rollers were covered with leather as before. The type-bed
was moved by a very ingenious mechanism which is in use even at
the present time, and is described farther on, when the two-revolution
press is mentioned.

The different parts were not connected with each other, the cylinder,
the type-bed, the inking-rollers, and the fountain being operated
independently by separate driving mechanisms.

This press printed eight hundred sheets an hour, on one side.

A part of Clarkson's "Life of William Penn" was printed on this
press, and was the first book ever printed on a cylinder press.

Printers and publishers were sceptical as to the practical value of
this novel invention, but Mr. John Walter, the proprietor of the _London
Times_, with better foresight than the others, and needing increased
facilities for printing his paper, contracted for two presses, each
to have two impression cylinders.

These were constructed for him with great secrecy in a building
adjoining the pressroom of the _Times_, and on November 28, 1814,
the entire edition of that paper was printed on them,--the first
cylinder presses driven by steam power.

The mechanical principles were the same as in the first cylinder
press.

There were two impression cylinders, but only one type-bed, and the
latter had, therefore, to travel a greater distance than in the
single-cylinder press.

This made it impossible to obtain quite double the output of the
single-cylinder press, but each of these new presses produced eleven
hundred impressions an hour, a very respectable performance for
that early stage. The threefold motion of the cylinders was retained,
but the frisket frames were displaced, and tapes running over
rollers and underneath the cylinders held the sheets against the
impression surfaces.

An improvement was also made in the inking mechanism by the
addition of an intermediate roller between the fountain and the upper
distributing cylinder roller.

The next step in advance was the construction of the first of the
so-called perfecting presses, which was patented, December 24, 1814,
and erected in Mr.

Bensley's office in 1815 or 1816. This press had two type-beds and two
impression cylinders, one of each near either end of the press. The
cylinders instead of having a threefold motion revolved continuously.

The circumference of each corresponded approximately to the distance
traversed by one of the beds. The part of the cylinder which made
the impression was a little larger in diameter than the remainder,
the low portion giving the necessary room for the type-bed to return
without touching it.

The board from which the sheets were "fed" was near the centre of the
press, and at the top adjoining the feed board was an endless belt
made of cloth as wide as the board and running with an intermittent
motion over two rollers.

The sheet of paper was laid upon this belt, which then moved
forward, carrying the sheet between the tapes and leading it to
the top of, down and around, the first cylinder where it received
the first impression.

Thence the sheet was conveyed by the tapes to the top of and around
the second impression cylinder and was printed on the reverse
side, that is "perfected," and it was then taken from the lower
side of the second cylinder by hand and laid upon a board in the
centre of the press, between the two impression cylinders and
underneath the feed board.

This press printed both sides of a sheet 21 × 34-1/2 inches
at a speed of nine hundred to one thousand an hour.

Shortly afterward a single-cylinder press was constructed upon the
same principle, the forerunner of what is now known as the single
large or drum cylinder press.

Within the next few years, Applegath and Cowper greatly simplified
the presses in the _Times_ and in Bensley's office by removing many
of the gear wheels.

They also invented the first inking-table, a flat, iron plate attached
to the type-bed which enabled the rollers to distribute the ink more
evenly than before.

They placed rollers at an angle across the ink-table and introduced
the revolving roller and the scraping blade in the ink-fountain.

More important, however, were Napier's inventions about 1824, of
"grippers" which seized the sheet of paper at its front edge and
drew it from the feed board, while the cylinder was in motion, and
of a method of alternately depressing and raising the impression
cylinders on the forward and backward stroke of the type-bed, making
it unnecessary to have a part of the cylinders of smaller diameter
than the rest to allow the type to pass under it as the bed returned.

This made it possible to use cylinders of a smaller diameter. These
improvements were first embodied in a perfecting press made for
Hansard, a London printer.

Although a number of presses were already being operated by steam
power, Hansard, in his description of the Napier bed and platen
press (the "Nay-Peer," he called it) finds a peculiar advantage in
that "it supersedes the necessity of steam power, as the motion of
this machine is gained by two men turning a fly-wheel which acts
as the impelling power."

I have described the development of the printing press up to this
state with considerable detail, because it discloses the main
principles of the book press of the present day.

During the first quarter of the last century, the manufacture of cylinder
presses was confined to England, not only because London was then
the leading centre of civilization, but because nowhere else could
be found the mechanical facilities for constructing the large metal
frames and parts.

Koenig left London for his native land in 1817, dejected by the
treatment he had received at the hands of Bensley, both in financial
matters and in the attempts to disparage his achievements.

He was followed two years later by his friend Bauer, and together
they founded the firm of Koenig & Bauer at Oberzell, where it still
thrives as one of the largest factories in Germany.

It was not long, however, before the United States took the lead
in the number of presses manufactured as well as in their improvement,
and the present high state of efficiency of American presses makes
them models which are copied in all other countries.

These improvements and the perfections of details often presented
problems which were more difficult to solve than those of the earlier
inventors, and thousands of patents have been granted to Americans
for new and ingenious devices.

The firm of R. Hoe & Co., which as early as 1822 was already engaged
in the manufacture of hand-presses in New York, commenced about
1832 to manufacture flat-bed cylinder presses, beginning with the
single large or drum cylinder press which was followed soon afterward
by the single small cylinder and the double small cylinder press,
the flat-bed perfecting press, the stop-cylinder press, the
two-revolution press, and the rotary book press.

They also made and are still making large newspaper and color presses
which are used all over the civilized world, but of these we will
not treat here.

As stated at the beginning of this article the chief object in press
making has always been to lessen the cost of printing, but after
increased speed had been attained, there came a demand for a press
that would produce the finest quality of printing without sacrificing
the quantity produced.

To meet this no press has ever surpassed the stop cylinder. It has
been made in several different sizes, the largest having a type-bed
45 × 65 inches. Resting upon and attached to a heavy iron foundation
are two iron side frames which are securely braced together by an
upper iron frame, called the "rib."

This upper frame contains four tracks faced with hard steel, on which
run a series of friction rollers, supporting the iron type-bed. Attached
to the front of the type-bed is an iron plate, called the ink-table,
its surface level with the surface of the type-form as it lies upon
the bed.

At the front of the press is the ink-fountain and a number of steel and
composition rollers, called the "distributing rollers."

The ink is delivered a little at a time from the fountain to the revolving
distributing rollers, and from them to the ink-table which moves
under the rollers with the motion of the type-bed. By this means the
ink is distributed upon the entire surface of the ink-table in a thin,
even film.

From the ink-table the ink is taken by a set of six rollers, called
the "form rollers."

Resting on the form rollers and moving in contact with them are additional
rollers which help to distribute the ink still finer before it
reaches the type.

The impression cylinder is located at a distance from the front of
the press of about two-thirds of the entire length of the press.

The circumference of the cylinder is equal to the distance that the
type-bed travels in one direction. When the type-bed moves from
the front to the rear, the cylinder rotates in unison with it, and
thus the cylinder makes one revolution. While the bed returns the
cylinder does not move.

Near the rear of the press is a large wooden board extending
across the press and lying in a slightly inclined position with
its lower edge almost directly above the centre of the impression
cylinder. This is the "feed board" upon which the sheets of paper lie
before they are printed.

The impression cylinder has a set of grippers, and when the cylinder
is at rest, these grippers are close to the edge of the feed board
and stand open to receive the edge of the sheet of paper.

Extending a little over the front of the feed board are two gauges
against which the front edge of the sheet of paper is placed, while
one side edge of the sheet is placed against a gauge at the side
of the feed board.

Just an instant before the cylinder commences to rotate, the grippers
seize the front edge of the sheet, and the gauges lift out of the
way.

The cylinder then carries the sheet around, meets the moving inked
form, and makes the impression.

Before the cylinder completes its revolution, the grippers open and
release the sheet, and at the same instant another set of grippers
on an adjoining cylinder, called the "delivery cylinder," seize the
sheet.

From this delivery cylinder the sheet runs down over a set of
strings, and is lifted off the strings by a sort of fan, or "sheet
flier," and deposited on a table at the rear of the press.

This method of delivering the sheets is known as the cylinder or
rear delivery.

This press may also be fitted for "front delivery."

By this method the sheet of paper after being printed is carried
around on the impression cylinder until the front edge comes again
to the feeding point.

Just as the impression cylinder comes to a stop, a set of grippers
seize the front edge of the printed sheet, draw it over and away
from the impression cylinder, and deposit it, with the printed side
up, upon a table near the front of the press and above the ink-fountain
and distributing rollers.

The average speed of one of these presses is from one thousand to
fifteen hundred impressions an hour, depending upon the desired
quality of the work.

Notwithstanding the excellent qualities of the stop-cylinder
press, commercial necessities often demand a sacrifice of quality
to speed, and this has brought the two-revolution press into very
general use.

As the name implies, the cylinder makes two revolutions, one to print
the sheet, and the other, an idle one, to allow the bed to return.

While the bed is returning, the impression cylinder is lifted to
clear the type-form. As the cylinder rotates continually at a uniform
speed, the type-bed must also travel at a constant speed. The reversal
of the movements of the bed must, therefore, take place in a
short space of time.

The study of inventors has been concentrated upon this subject
more than upon any other connected with flat-bed presses, and
hundreds of patents for "bed motions" have been taken out.

Considering the fact that in the larger presses the weight of the bed
and form is about one and a half tons and that this weight moving
at a speed of about six feet in a second must be brought to a full
stop and put into motion again in the opposite direction at full
speed in about one-quarter of a second, it is obvious that the problem
was not an easy one, especially when the reversal of the bed must
be accomplished without a jar or vibration.

The mechanism employed has always been a driving gear and one or two
toothed racks. In Koenig's original movement, the driving gear on the
end of a rising and falling shaft ran on top of a rack
attached to the bottom of the bed in order to drive the bed in one
direction, and then descending around the end of the rack ran in the
bottom to the same rack to drive the bed in the other direction
and ascending at the other end to repeat the movement.

This, as already stated, has proven a very efficient mechanism and is
employed, with improvements, by some of the press manufacturers
of the present time.

In a pamphlet entitled "A Short History of the Printing Press" (New
York, 1902), by Robert Hoe, the writer describes a method of reversing
the bed. Although somewhat technical, it seems desirable to quote
him as follows: "As early as 1847, Hoe & Co. patented an entirely
new bed-driving mechanism.

To a hanger fixed on the lower side of the bed were attached two racks
facing each other, but not in the same vertical plane, and separated
by a distance equal to the diameter of the driving wheel, which was on
a horizontal shaft and movable sideways so as to engage in either
one or other of the racks.

I said as much to the bald-headed operator, who smiled
wearily and replaced his hat: "Dawg? They's moh houn'-dawgs in Citron
City than they's wood-ticks to keep them busy. I reckon a dollah 'll
do a heap foh you, suh."

"Could you get me a dog for a dollar?" I asked;--"one with points?"

"Points? I sholy can, suh;--plenty of points. What kind of dawg do yoh
requiah, suh?--live dawg? daid dawg? houn'-dawg? raid-dawg? hawg-dawg?
coon-dawg?--"

The locomotive emitted a long, lazy, softly modulated and thoroughly
Southern toot. I handed the operator a silver dollar, and he presently
emerged from his office and slouched off up the street, while I walked
with Miss Barrison to the station platform, where I resumed the
discussion of her future movements.

"You are very young to take such a risk," I said, gravely. "Had I not
better buy your ticket back to New York? The north-bound train meets
this one. I suppose we are waiting for it now--" I stopped, conscious
of her impatience.

Her face flushed brightly: "Yes; I think it best. I have embarrassed
you too long already--"

"Don't say that!" I muttered. "I--I--shall be deadly bored without
you."

"I am not an entertainer, only a stenographer," she said, curtly.
"Please get me my ticket, Mr. Gilland."

She gazed at me from the car-platform; the locomotive tooted two
drawling toots.

"It is for your sake," I said, avoiding her gaze as the far-off
whistle of the north-bound express came floating out of the blue
distance.

She did not answer; I fished out my watch, regarding it in silence,
listening to the hum of the approaching train, which ought presently
to bear her away into the North, where nothing could menace her except
the brilliant pitfalls of a Christian civilization. But I stood
there, temporizing, unable to utter a word as her train shot by us
with a rush, slower, slower, and finally stopped, with a long-drawn
sigh from the air-brakes.

At that instant the telegraph-operator appeared, carrying a dog by the
scruff of the neck--a sad-eyed, ewe-necked dog, from the four corners
of which dangled enormous, cushion-like paws. He yelped when he beheld
me. The internal arrangement is clearly indicated by the illustration,
Fig. 8. It will be noticed that each of the four wheels has an upper
and a lower row of buckets and that there is a set of stationary
buckets for each wheel between the two rows of moving buckets.

These stationary buckets are called intermediates, and are counterparts
of the moving buckets.

Their sole office is to redirect the steam which has passed through the
upper buckets into the lower ones at the proper angle.

[Illustration: FIG. 8. ELEVATION AND PART-SECTIONAL VIEW OF A
1500-KILOWATT CURTIS TURBINE]
The wheels are kept the proper distance apart by the length of hub,
and all are held together by the large nut on the shaft above the upper
wheel. Each wheel is in a separate chamber formed by the
diaphragms which rest on ledges on the inside of the wheel-case,
their weight and steam pressure on the upper side holding them
firmly in place and making a steam-tight joint where they rest.

At the center, where the hubs pass through them, there is provided a
self-centering packing ring (Fig. 9), which is free to move sidewise,
but is prevented from turning, by suitable lugs.

This packing is a close running fit on the hubs of the wheel and is
provided with grooves (plainly shown in Fig. 9) which break up and
diminish the leakage of steam around each hub from one stage to the
next lower.

Each diaphragm, with the exception of the top one, carries the expanding
nozzles for the wheel immediately below.

[Illustration: FIG. 9]
The expanding nozzles and moving buckets constantly increase in
size and number from the top toward the bottom.

This is because the steam volume increases progressively from the
admission to the exhaust and the entire expansion is carried out
in the separate sets of nozzles, very much as if it were one
continuous nozzle; but with this difference, not all of the energy
is taken out of the steam in any one set of nozzles.

The idea is to keep the velocity of the steam in each stage as nearly
constant as possible.

The nozzles in the diaphragms and the intermediates do not, except
in the lowest stage, take up the entire circumference, but are
proportioned to the progressive expansion of steam as it descends
toward the condenser.

Clearance
While the machine is running it is imperative that there be no
rubbing contact between the revolving and stationary parts, and
this is provided for by the clearance between the rows of moving
buckets and the intermediates.

Into each stage of the machine a 2-inch pipe hole is drilled and
tapped.

Sometimes this opening is made directly opposite a row of moving
buckets as in Fig. 10, and sometimes it is made opposite the
intermediate.

When opposite a row of buckets, it will allow one to see the amount
of clearance between the buckets and the intermediates, and between
the buckets and the nozzles.

    When drilled opposite
    the intermediates, the
    clearance is shown
    top and bottom between the
    buckets and
    intermediates.

(See Fig. 11.) This clearance is not the same in all stages, but is
greatest in the fourth stage and least in the first. The clearances in
each stage are nearly as follows: First stage, 0.060 to 0.080;
second stage, 0.080 to 0.100; third stage, 0.080 to 0.100; fourth
stage, 0.080 to 0.200.

These clearances are measured by what are called clearance gages,
which are simply taper slips of steel about 1/2-inch wide accurately
ground and graduated, like a jeweler's ring gage, by marks about
1/2-inch apart; the difference in thickness of the gage is
one-thousandth of an inch from one mark to the next.

[Illustration: FIG. 10]
[Illustration: FIG. 11]
To determine whether the clearance is right, one of the 2-inch
plugs is taken out and some marking material, such as red lead or
anything that would be used on a surface plate or bearing to mark
the high spots is rubbed on the taper gage, and it is pushed into
the gap between the buckets and intermediates as far as it will go,
and then pulled out, the marking on the gage showing just how far
in it went, and the nearest mark giving in thousandths of an inch
the clearance.

This is noted, the marking spread again, and the gage tried on the
other side, the difference on the gage showing whether the wheel
is high or low.

Whichever may be the case the hight is corrected by the step-bearing
screw.

The wheels should be placed as nearly in the middle of the clearance
space as possible.

By some operators the clearance is adjusted while running, in the
following manner: With the machine running at full speed the
step-bearing screw is turned until the wheels are felt or heard to
rub lightly.

The screw is marked and then turned in the opposite direction until
the wheel rubs again.

Another mark is made on the screw and it is then turned back midway
between the two marks.
Either method is safe if practiced by a skilful engineer.

In measuring the clearance by the first method, the gage should be
used with care, as it is possible by using too much pressure to
swing the buckets and get readings which could be misleading.

To an inexperienced man the taper gages would seem preferable.

In the hands of a man who knows what he is doing and how to do it,
a tapered pine stick will give as satisfactory results as the most
elaborate set of hardened and ground clearance gages.

Referring back to Fig. 11, at A is shown one of the peep-holes opposite
the intermediate in the third stage wheel for the inspection of
clearance.

The taper clearance gage is inserted through this hole both above
and below the intermediate, and the distance which it enters registers
the clearance on that side.

This sketch also shows plainly how the shrouding on the buckets and
the intermediates extends beyond the sharp edges of the buckets,
protecting them from damage in case of slight rubbing.

In a very few cases wheels have been known to warp to such an extent
from causes that were not discovered until too late, that adjustment
would not stop the rubbing.

In such cases the shrouding has been turned or faced off by a cutting-off
tool used through the peep-hole.

Carbon Packing Used

Where the shaft passes through the upper head of the wheel-case some
provision must be made to prevent steam from the first stage
escaping.

This is provided for by carbon packing (Fig. 12), which consists of
blocks of carbon in sets in a packing case bolted to the top head
of the wheel-case. There are three sets of these blocks, and each set
is made of two rings of three segments each. One ring of segments
breaks joints with its mate in the case, and each set is separated
from the others by a flange in the case in which it is held.

In some cases the packing is kept from turning by means of a link,
one end of which is fastened to the case and the other to the packing
holder. Sometimes light springs are used to hold the packing against
the shaft and in some the pressure of steam in the case does this.

There is a pipe, also shown in Fig. 12, leading from the main line
to the packing case, the pressure in the pipe being reduced. The
space between the two upper sets of rings is drained to the third
stage by means of a three-way cock, which keeps the balance between
the atmosphere and packing-case pressure.

The carbon rings are fitted to the shaft with a slight clearance
to start with, and very soon get a smooth finish, which is not only
practically steam-tight but frictionless.

[Illustration: FIG. 12]
The carbon ring shown in Fig. 12 is the older design. The segments are
held against the flat bearing surface of the case by spiral springs
set in brass ferrules.

The circle is held together by a bronze strap screwed and drawn
together at the ends by springs.

Still other springs press the straps against the surface upon which
the carbon bears, cutting off leaks through joints and across
horizontal surfaces of the carbon.

The whole ring is prevented from turning by a connecting-rod which
engages a pin in the hole, like those provided for the springs.

[Illustration: FIG. 13]

[Illustration: FIG. 16]

The Safety-stop

There are several designs of safety-stop or speed-limit devices used
with these turbines, the simplest being of the ring type shown in
Fig.

13. This consists of a flat ring placed around the shaft between the
turbine and generator. The ring-type emergencies are now all adjusted
so that they normally run concentric with the shaft, but weighted
so that the center of gravity is slightly displaced from the center.

The centrifugal strain due to this is balanced by helical springs. But
when the speed increases the centrifugal force moves the ring into
an eccentric position, when it strikes a trigger and releases a
weight which, falling, closes the throttle and shuts off the steam
supply.

The basic principle upon which all these stops are designed is the
same--the centrifugal force of a weight balanced by a spring at
normal speed.

Figs. 14, 15, and 16 show three other types.

The Mechanical Valve-Gear
Fig. 17 shows plainly the operation of the mechanical valve-gear.

The valves are located in the steam chests, which are bolted to
the top of the casing directly over the first sets of expansion
nozzles.

The chests, two in number, are on opposite sides of the machine.
The valve-stems extend upward through ordinary stuffing-boxes, and
are attached to the notched cross-heads by means of a threaded end
which is prevented from screwing in or out by a compression nut on
the lower end of the cross-head.

Each cross-head is actuated by a pair of reciprocating pawls, or
dogs (shown more plainly in the enlarged view, Fig. 18), one of
which opens the valve and the other closes it.

The several pairs of pawls are hung on a common shaft which receives
a rocking motion from a crank driven from a worm and worm-wheel by
the turbine shaft.

The cross-heads have notches milled in the side in which the pawls
engage to open or close the valve, this engagement being determined
by what are called shield-plates, A (Fig. 18), which are controlled
by the governor.

These plates are set, one a little ahead of the other, to obtain
successive opening or closing of the valves.

When more steam is required the shield plate allows the proper pawl to
fall into its notch in the cross-head and lift the valve from its
seat.

If less steam is wanted the shield-plate rises and allows the lower pawl
to close the valve on the down stroke.

[Illustration: FIG. 17]
[Illustration: FIG. 18]

The valves, as can easily be seen, are very simple affairs, the
steam pressure in the steam chest holding the valve either open or
shut until it is moved by the pawl on the rock-shaft.

The amount of travel on the rock-shaft is fixed by the design, but
the proportionate travel above and below the horizontal is
controlled by the length of the connecting-rods from the crank to
the rock-shaft. There are besides the mechanical valve-gear the
electric and hydraulic, but these will be left for a future
article.

The Governor

The speed of the machine is controlled by the automatic opening and
closing of the admission valves under the control of a governor
(Fig.
19), of the spring-weighted type attached directly to the top end
of the turbine shaft.

The action of the governor depends on the balance of force
exerted by the spring, and the centrifugal effort of the
rectangular-shaped weights at the lower end; the moving weights
acting through the knife-edge suspension tend to pull down the lever
against the resistance of the heavy helical spring.

The governor is provided with an auxiliary spring on the outside of the
governor dome for varying the speed while synchronizing. The tension
of the auxiliary spring is regulated by a small motor wired to the
switchboard.

This spring should be used only to correct slight changes in speed.
Any marked change should be corrected by the use of the large
hexagonal nut in the upper plate of the governor frame.

This nut is screwed down to increase the speed, and upward to decrease
it.

[Illustration: FIG. 19] 

The Stage Valves
Fig. 20 represents one of the several designs of stage valve,
sometimes called the overload valve, the office of which is to
prevent too high pressure in the first stage in case of a sudden
overload, and to transfer a part of the steam to a special set of
expanding nozzles over the second-stage wheel.

This valve is balanced by a spring of adjustable tension, and is,
or can be, set to open and close within a very small predetermined
range of first-stage pressure.

The valve is _intended_ to open and close instantly, and to supply
or cut off steam from the second stage, without affecting
the speed regulation or economy of operation.

If any leaking occurs past the valve it is taken care of by a
drip-pipe to the third stage.

[Illustration: FIG. 20]
The steam which passes through the automatic stage valves and is
admitted to the extra set of nozzles above the second-stage wheel
acts upon this wheel just the same as the steam which passes through
the regular second-stage nozzles; i.e., all the steam which goes
through the machine tends to hasten its speed, or, more accurately,
does work and _maintains_ the speed of the machine.

II. SETTING THE VALVES OF THE CURTIS TURBINE[2]

[2] Contributed to _Power_ by F. L. Johnson.

Under some conditions of service the stage valve in the Curtis
turbine will not do what it is designed to do.

It is usually attached to the machine in such manner that it will operate
with, or a little behind, in the matter of time, the sixth valve.

The machine is intended to carry full load with only the first bank
of five valves in operation, with proper steam pressure and vacuum.
If the steam pressure is under 150 pounds, or the vacuum is less
than 28 inches, the sixth valve may operate at or near full load,
and also open the stage valve and allow steam to pass to the
second-stage nozzles at a much higher rate of speed than the steam
which has already done some work in the first-stage wheel.

The tendency is to accelerate unduly the speed of the machine.
This is corrected by the governor, but the correction is usually
carried too far and the machine slows down.

With the stage valve in operation, at a critical point the regulation
is uncertain and irregular, and its use has to be abandoned. The excess
first-stage pressure will then be taken care of by the relief
valve, which is an ordinary spring safety valve (not pop) which
allows the steam to blow into the atmosphere.

The mechanical valve-gear does not often get out of order, but
sometimes the unexpected happens.

The shop man may not have properly set up the nuts on the valve-stems;
or may have fitted the distance bushings between the shield plates
too closely; the superheat of the steam may distort the steam chest
slightly and produce friction that will interfere with the regulation.

If any of the valve-stems should become loose in the cross-heads
they may screw themselves either in or out.

If screwed out too far, the valve-stem becomes too long and the pawl in
descending will, after the valve is seated, continue downward until
it has broken something.

If screwed in, the cross-head will be too low for the upper pawl
to engage and the valve will not be opened. This second condition
is not dangerous, but should be corrected. The valve-stems should
be made the right length, and all check-nuts set up firmly.

If for any purpose it becomes necessary to "set the valves" on a
1500-kilowatt mechanical gear, the operator should proceed in the
following manner.

Setting the Valves of a 1500-Kilowatt Curtis Turbine
We will consider what is known as the "mechanical" valve-gear, with
two sets of valves, one set of five valves being located on each
side of the machine.

[Illustration: FIG. 21]
In setting the valves we should first "throw out" all pawls to avoid
breakage in case the rods are not already of proper length, holding
the pawls out by slipping the ends of the pawl springs over the points
of the pawls, as seen in Fig. 21. Then turn the machine slowly by hand
until the pawls on one set of valves are at their highest point
of travel, then with the valves wide open adjust the drive-rods,
i.e., the rods extending from the crank to the rock-shaft, so that
there is 1/32 of an inch clearance (shown dotted in Fig. 17, Chap.

I) at the point of opening of the pawls when they are "in." (See
Fig. 22.) Then set up the check-nuts on the drive-rod. Turn the
machine slowly, until the pawls are at their lowest point of travel.
Then, with the valves closed, adjust each _valve-stem_ to give 1/32
of an inch clearance at the point of closing of the pawls when
they are "in," securely locking the check-nut as each valve is set.

Repeat this operation on the other side of the machine and we are
ready to adjust the governor-rods.

(Valves cannot be set on both sides of the machine at the same
time, as the pawls will not be in the same relative position, due to
the angularity of the drive-rods.)
[Illustration: FIG. 22]
Next, with the turbine running, and the synchronizing spring
in mid-position, adjust the governor-rods so that the turbine
will run at the normal speed of 900 revolutions per minute when
working on the fifth valve, and carrying full load.

The governor-rods for the other side of the turbine (controlling
valves Nos. 6 to 10) should be so adjusted that the speed change
between the fifth and sixth valves will not be more than three or
four revolutions per minute.

The valves of these turbines are all set during the shop test and the
rods trammed with an 8-inch tram. Governors are adjusted for a speed
range of 2 per cent. between no load and full load (1500 kilowatt),
or 4 per cent. between the mean speeds of the first and tenth valves
(no load to full overload capacity).

The rods which connect the governor with the valve-gear have ordinary
brass ends or heads and are adjusted by right-and-left threads and
secured by lock-nuts. They are free fits on the pins which pass through
the heads, and no friction is likely to occur which will interfere
with the regulation, but too close work on the shield-plate bushings,
or a slight warping of the steam chest, will often produce friction
which will seriously impair the regulation.

If it is noticed that the shield-plate shaft has any tendency to oscillate
in unison with the rock-shaft which carries the pawls, it is a
sure indication that the shield-plates are not as free as they
should be, and should be attended to.

The governor-rod should be disconnected, the pawls thrown out and
the pawl strings hooked over the ends.

The plates should then be rocked up and down by hand and the friction
at different points noted.

The horizontal rod at the back of the valve-gear may be loosened
and the amount of end play of each individual shield-plate noticed
and compared with the bushings on the horizontal rod at the back
which binds the shield-plates together.

If the plates separately are found to be perfectly free they may be
each one pushed hard over to the right or left and wedged; then
each bushing tried in the space between the tail-pieces of the plates.
It will probably be found that the bushings are not of the right
length, due to the alteration of the form of the steam chest by heat.

It will generally be found also that the bushings are too short,
and that the length can be corrected by very thin washers of sheet
metal.

It has been found in some instances that the thin bands coming with
sectional pipe covering were of the right thickness.

After the length of the bushings is corrected the shield-plates
may be assembled, made fast and tested by rocking them up and down,
searching for signs of sticking. If none occurs, the work has been
correctly done, and there will be no trouble from poor regulation due
to friction of the shield-plates.

The Baffler
The water which goes to the step-bearing passes through a baffler, the
latest type of which is shown by Fig. 23. It is a device for restricting
the flow of water or oil to the step- and guide-bearing. The amount
of water necessary to float the machine and lubricate the guide-bearing
having been determined by calculation and experiment, the plug is
set at that point which will give the desired flow.

The plug is a square-threaded worm, the length of which and the
distance which it enters the barrel of the baffler determining the
amount of flow.

The greater the number of turns which the water must pass through
in the worm the less will flow against the step-pressure.

[Illustration: FIG. 23]
The engineers who have settled upon the flow and the pressure decided
that a flow of from 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 gallons per minute and a
step-pressure of from 425 to 450 pounds is correct.

These factors are so dependent upon each other and upon the conditions
of the step-bearing itself that they are sometimes difficult to
realize in every-day work; nor is it necessary.

If the machine turns freely with a lower pressure than that prescribed
by the engineers, there is no reason for raising this pressure;
and there is only one way of doing it without reducing the area of
the step-bearing, and that is by obstructing the flow of water in
the step-bearing itself.

A very common method used is that of grinding.

The machine is run at about one-third speed and the step-water shut
off for 15 or 20 seconds.

This causes grooves and ridges on the faces of the step-bearing
blocks, due to their grinding on each other, which obstruct the
flow of water between the faces and thus raises the pressure.

It seems a brutal way of getting a scientific result, if the result
desired can be called scientific.

The grooving and cutting of the step-blocks will not do any harm,
and in fact they will aid in keeping the revolving parts of the
machine turning about its mechanical center.

The operating engineer will be very slow to see the utility of the
baffler, and when he learns, as he will sometime, that the turbine
will operate equally well with a plug out as with it in the baffler,
he will be inclined to remove the baffler.

It is true that with one machine operating on its own pump it is
possible to run without the baffler, and it is also possible that
in some particular case two machines having identical step-bearing
pressures might be so operated.

The baffler, however, serves a very important function, as described
more fully as follows: It tends to steady the flow from the pump,
to maintain a constant oil film as the pressure varies with the
load, and when several machines are operating on the same step-bearing
system it is the only means which fixes the flow to the different
machines and prevents one machine from robbing the others.

Therefore, even if an engineer felt inclined to remove the baffler he
would be most liable to regret taking such a step.

If the water supply should fail from any cause and the step-bearing
blocks rub together, no great amount of damage will result.

The machine will stop if operated long under these conditions, for
if steam pressure is maintained the machine will continue in operation
until the buckets come into contact, and if the step-blocks are not
welded together the machine may be started as soon as the water is
obtained.

If vibration occurs it will probably be due to the rough treatment
of the step-blocks, and may be cured by homeopathic repeat-doses
of grinding, say about 15 seconds each.

If the step-blocks are welded a new pair should be substituted and
the damaged ones refaced.

Some few experimental steps of spherical form, called "saucer"
steps, have been installed with success (see Fig. 24).

They seem to aid the lower guide-bearing in keeping the machine rotating
about the mechanical center and reduce the wear on the guide-bearing.

In some instances, too, cast-iron bushings have been substituted
for bronze, with marked success.

There seems to be much less wear between cast-iron and babbitt metal
than between bronze and babbitt metal.

The matter is really worth a thorough investigation.

III. ALLIS-CHALMERS COMPANY STEAM TURBINE

In Fig. 25 may be seen the interior construction of the steam turbine
built by Allis-Chalmers Co., of Milwaukee, Wis., which is, in
general, the same as the well-known Parsons type.

This is a plan view showing the rotor resting in position in the
lower half of its casing.

[Illustration: FIG. 25]
Fig. 26 is a longitudinal cross-section cut of rotor and both lower and
upper casing.

Through
the vista of trees the pink shirt-waist of the pretty stenographer
glimmered like a rose blooming in the wilderness.

From whatever point I viewed the prospect that pink spot seemed to
intrude; I turned my back and examined the jungle, but there it was
repeated in a hundred pink blossoms among the massed thickets; I
looked up into the tree-tops, where pink mosses spotted the palms; I
looked out over the lake, and I saw it in my mind's eye pinker than
ever. They are enabled to do this and give their customers much greater
value for their money, only through better business methods, more
modern facilities, and by conducting the business on a very large
scale.

The screens used in making half-tones represent an enormous outlay
in the large shops.

A comparatively small screen costs in the neighborhood of $100. A screen
18 × 20, ruled 120 or 133 lines to the inch, costs about $500.

Screens are made with different numbers of lines to the inch, from
65, for coarse, newspaper work, up to 400.

The screens in general use are 65, 85, 100, 110, 120, 133, 150,
166, 175, and 200; but intermediate sizes are also used, such as
125 and 140.

A screen containing 200 lines to the inch is about the finest ever
used for ordinary printing purposes, though a few screens with 250,
300, and 400 lines to the inch have been made.

A well-equipped photo-engraving establishment must have all these
screens, and all of them in many different sizes.

In the writer's shop there are fifteen cameras, all of them in
constant use in the daytime and five or six of them are always in
use all night.

Some days the bulk of the work in the place will be a fine grade
of magazine engraving calling for a 175 screen.

In order to keep all the cameras at work all the time, a thing that
is very important in a well-regulated place, it is necessary to
have a number of 175 screens almost equal to the number of cameras.

The same is true of most of the other screens in general use.
Fortunately for the engraver and the consumer these screens practically
last forever if carefully handled.

The greatest developments in process work during the past few years
have been in the making of color plates. Beautiful results are
obtained in two colors by the "duograph" or "duotone" processes,
the plates being made for two printings.

The three-color process aims to reproduce all colors in three
printings, by using inks of red, yellow, and blue.

This process is very interesting, but somewhat intricate.

Primarily, the results are made possible by color separations. The
aim is to take a colored subject--an oil painting, for instance--and
by photographing it three times, each time through a different
colored piece of glass, to divide all the colors into what are
called the three primary colors--red, yellow, and blue.

From each of these color separations a half-tone plate is made, and
when these plates are put on the printing-press, and the impressions
are printed over each other in yellow, red, and blue inks,
respectively, the result is a printed picture reproducing correctly
all the colors of the original subject.

While many subjects may be reproduced accurately by this process, yet
the three-color process seems inadequate to give perfectly
satisfactory results in all cases. Nearly all three-color process houses
are now prepared to add a fourth, or key, plate, to be printed in
black, in case the subject seems to need it.

The three-color process has enabled many of the leading magazines to
use illustrations in colors, and there is not the slightest doubt
but that there is a great future for this class of work.

THE WAX PROCESS
By Robert D. Servoss.

Almost all of the maps found in text and reference books, as well
as the geometrical diagrams used in mathematical and scientific
works, are made by what is known as the "wax process."

This process was invented and patented by an Englishman named Palmer
about 1840, shortly after the discovery of the method of making electrotype
plates for printing purposes. He announced that he would furnish
artists with copper plates covered with a waxlike composition on
which they could make their own drawings, in a manner similar to
but much simpler than the method followed by the etcher on copper.

After receiving the artist's work, the plates were to be returned
to Palmer, who then made an ordinary electrotype of the engraving.

A circular, issued about 1841, gives the necessary instructions for
engraving, and the prices for the wax-coated plates and the subsequent
electrotypes, and shows many beautiful illustrations made by artists
of that time.

It was then called the "glyphographic process."

The process was first introduced into this country by a firm of
printers in Buffalo, New York, and was used by them for several
years for illustrating the United States patent office reports until
it was superseded upon the introduction of photo-lithography and
the subsequent adoption by the government of a uniform standard for
patent drawings.

This process may be described in a general way as follows: A copper
plate having a highly polished surface is first blackened by the
application of a weak solution of sulphuret of potassium, or other
chemical which will oxidize the copper.

Then a composition, made by melting together in proper proportions,
beeswax, zinc-white, and paraffin, is "flowed" over the blackened
surface, producing an opaque whitish engraving ground.

The thickness of the wax is varied according to the subject to be
engraved, but in general should not exceed that of heavy writing
paper.

After it has been allowed to cool with the plate lying perfectly
horizontal, the wax is smoothed down to an even thickness by a steel
scraper, and the plate is then ready to receive the engraving.

Taking for an example the engraving of a map, the original copy is
either photographed on the wax surface, or is transferred to it by
covering the back of the copy with red chalk and tracing over every
line with a steel point.

The photograph, or the tracing, on the wax must not be a reversed
one, as might be supposed, but should "read right." The outlines of
the map are then gone over, with an engraving tool which cuts out
a small channel in the wax, down to, but not into, the surface of
the copper plate.

The bottoms of these channels will eventually form the surface of
the relief lines in the resultant electrotype plate, but now appear
as dark lines against the whitish groundwork of the wax.

The engraving tools are made in different sizes, and therefore
channels of varying widths at the bottoms may be cut in order to
produce lines of different sizes.

In cutting lines to indicate rivers,--which must be thin at the source
and increase in thickness as they approach the mouth,--tools are used
in graduated sizes.

The first one cuts its own line of equal width for a very short distance,
then another and slightly wider tool is used, the next still wider, and
so on until the river line is completed. In reality a series of steps,
the work is so done that the line appears to the eye to increase
in width evenly and gradually from a very fine beginning to a heavy
ending.

The wavy lines indicating hills and mountains are made in substantially
the same way. Special steel punches are pressed through the wax
to the copper to show town and capital marks, and after all the
lines and marks are completed, the plate is ready to receive the
lettering.

The name of each individual town, city, state, or river is set up
in printer's type and stamped one name at a time into the wax.

The type is placed in a small tool resembling a vise, which holds
it in perfect alignment and on a perfect level.

Tools of various shapes are used for stamping the names in
straight and curved lines. It is necessary to wet the type to prevent
its adhering to the wax.

The plate is then carefully compared with the original copy and
after any necessary corrections have been made it is gone over by
an expert operator, who cuts out any of the channels which may have
been obliterated by the burr of the wax, resulting from pressing
in the names.

We now have a plate in which the lines have been cut in small
channels and the names stamped with type.

This is a matrix, or mould, from which an electrotype of the lines now
sunken in the wax may be made in high relief for printing, but the
blank portions of the wax are so thin that it is first necessary to
fill in all these places on the plates with wax in order to produce a
sufficiently deep electrotype plate.

This is done by "building up" the plate. A small hook-shaped tool,
heated over a gas jet, is used to melt small pieces of wax which
are run carefully around all the names and in the spaces between
lines, thus filling up all these spaces with a round, smooth body
of wax.

From this mould an ordinary electrotype is made by the method described
elsewhere in this book.

All these operations require much skill and patience at every step,
but the plates produced by the wax process are always much deeper and
stronger than those made by any other process.

MAKING INTAGLIO PLATES
By Elmer Latham.

The method by which a photogravure plate is produced, is probably the
least understood of all of the many photo-processes of
reproduction.
This is chiefly on account of the difficulty of the process, which is
not an easy matter to explain in detail, and also on account of
the secrecy with which all plate makers guard their processes.

The reproduction of a mezzotint or line-engraved print, when
made by a good photogravure process, produces in most cases a print
which cannot be detected from the original.

The originator of the process was probably Fox Talbot, an Englishman.
The writer has seen one of his prints, made between 1855 and 1860,
which was a very creditable piece of work. Dujardin of Paris took
up Talbot's process, and after much modification, succeeded in
developing a successful process which he is working to-day. All
photogravure plate makers of the present time have more or less
copied the process of Fox Talbot.

There are three different methods of making these plates known to the
writer. The reader probably knows that a photogravure plate is not
a relief plate, but an intaglio, and is printed on an etching-press
in the same manner as an etching and requires special skill in
printing on the part of the printer to produce the best results.

I will give a brief explanation of the three different processes.

The first is known as the transfer process. In this process a reversed
photographic negative is made from the copy, from which a positive
or "transparency" is made, either by contact or in the camera.

A piece of carbon paper is then coated lightly with gelatine, sensitized
with bichromate of potassium and allowed to dry.

The paper is then placed in contact with the positive and printed
in daylight until the image is imprinted on the gelatine coating of
the paper, such portions of which as have received the most exposure
from the action of light becoming quite insoluble.

A copper plate, cleaned so that it is free from grease, is introduced
into a large box into which has been blown a very finely
powdered resin, which is allowed to settle somewhat before putting
in the plate. The plate is allowed to remain in the box until a
fine deposit of resin has settled all over it.

It is then carefully removed and heated over a gas burner until the
resin adheres firmly to the plate. The resin is melted only to such
a point that it forms a fine grain all over the plate, leaving interstices
of bare copper between. The paper, on the gelatine surface of which
the picture is printed, is now placed in a tray of warm water, and
the parts of the image which have had the least exposure are thereby
dissolved and washed away, the image being thus fully developed on
the paper. This is placed in contact with the grained plate, which
has been placed in the tray of water, and firmly squeezed in contact
with the plate.

The paper is stripped off, leaving the gelatine film on the copper. The
plate is now removed from the tray and dried, and is then ready for
etching, which is accomplished by placing the plate successively
in several baths of acid of different strengths until the desired
results are obtained.

This process gives a shallow plate, of not great wearing quality,
and, as a rule, requires a great deal of work by the engraver to
bring the plate up to anything like the copy.

The light tints come out very soft and smooth, but the black tones
etch "flat" and lose all detail. These blacks must be put in by
hand.

The poor wearing qualities of these plates make them undesirable
in cases where a large edition has to be printed.

The next process is the "deposited" plate used by "Goupil" of Paris,
in which copper is deposited by electricity upon a swelled gelatine
film which has had a grain formed upon its surface chemically or
otherwise.

The deposition has to be continued until the plate has acquired
the necessary thickness, which takes about three weeks; and this
is a long time to wait in these days, when a publisher usually
expects his order executed in ten days.

These plates are practically hand made. The process gives a plate
that could not possibly be used without a great deal of retouching
by an expert engraver.

Goupil turns out a beautiful plate, due principally to his large force
of engravers, one man working on a particular part of the plate,
then passing it on to another who does some other portion, and so
on, until the plate is finished.

In this way each engraver becomes exceedingly skilful in one thing.
Line engraving is reproduced by this process exceedingly well,
but such plates, like the transfer process, are shallow and give
out soon in the printing.

The last process that I have to deal with is the one I am working myself.
In this process the plates are made in two or more etchings,
according to the requirements of the subject which is to be
reproduced.

This method produces a plate of great depth both in the light and black
tints, and on account of the small amount of hand-work required after
the plate is etched, the copy is followed very closely.

With a good positive and favorable conditions, quite frequently a
plate is made upon which the retoucher needs to do no work at all,
and a more faithful reproduction is made than by any of the other
methods that I have mentioned.

After a good positive is procured, the copper plate is cleaned, and
a sensitized solution of gelatine is flowed over the plate, dried
down, and then printed under the positive, with a short exposure.

The plate is grained as in the transfer process, and is then etched.

This first etching, on account of the short exposure, goes over the
plate in about three minutes, and is simply intended to get the
light tints.

The plate is again cleaned off and coated, this time in a different
manner, and given a much longer exposure under the positive.

The next etching takes about three hours, which gives the blacks great
depth.

Comparing this with the transfer plate which has an etching of from
fifteen to twenty minutes, the reason for the difference in the
wearing qualities of the plate is quite evident. This process, whether
used by myself or others, I feel free to say is the best one that
has ever been worked, inasmuch as it gives a far more faithful
reproduction than any of the others with a minimum of work by the
retoucher.

Some plate makers claim to make all their plates without any
retouching, which cannot be done. As I have mentioned before,
occasionally a plate can be made as good as the copy without hand-work.
But to say that any chemical process gives such results continually,
or that a plate cannot be improved by a skilful retoucher is, to
say the least, misleading.

All of the different processes are very sensitive to atmospheric
influences, and no small amount of chemical as well as mechanical
skill is required to keep things running smoothly; and at certain
times the best of operators are at a loss to remedy some slight
fault that may upset things temporarily.
"I took my degree as D.E. at Barnard
College."

"What!" I exclaimed in astonishment. "You've been through Barnard? You

"It was my undoing," she said. "The department was abolished the year
I graduated. There was no similar vacancy, even in the Smithsonian."

She shrugged her shoulders, eyes fixed on the moths. "I had to make my

She looked up, a flush on her cheeks.

     Suddenly, as though disturbed by something inside, the moths all left
the window-pane, darting off in the darkness.

"That's curious," I said.

"What's curious?" she asked, opening her eyes languidly. Instead
of separate moulds standing about a stove to get ready for the
pouring, there are moulds in nests, or cylinders, resembling a
Gatling gun, or a tubular boiler.

There will perhaps be twenty roller moulds in a nest.

The cylinders are balanced in the centre on journals, thus enabling
the workman to place them at any angle desired, for purposes of
oiling the moulds and loading them with the roller cores.

The cylinders have hot and cold water contact, by which they may
be surrounded by either at will.

To warm the moulds the cylinder is put in an upright position, and hot
water circulated about it the required length of time.

The composition--which is something more than the old-time glue and
molasses--is prepared for pouring by melting in a double-jacketed
steam kettle, the stirring being done by a mixer run by steam power.

When ready, the composition is drawn off from the bottom of the cooking
kettles into pouring kettles which have air-tight hoods. To these
a hose is attached, the other end of the hose being connected with
a tank which is charged with air by a pump.

The hose being then attached to the cylinder, the air is introduced
from the tank into the pouring kettle, forcing the composition upward
into the cylinder, and all air from the moulds. This insures a perfect
roller.

When the composition has reached the top of the roller stocks, the
valve at the bottom of the cylinder is closed, and the process is
continued to the next cylinder ready for pouring.

The cooling of the cylinders is effected by turning the cold water current
around them, and a nest of moulds may be filled and emptied four or
five times a day. After the cooling, the bottom plate of the cylinder
is removed; the rollers drop out, are trimmed, and are ready
for the shipping box.

THE ILLUSTRATOR
By Charles D. Williams.

It is only in comparatively modern times that the art of illustration
has received the encouragement that makes for perfection.

For this, the cheapening of the manufacturing cost in printing is mainly
responsible.

An illustration proper should always accompany text and in days
past the making of a book was so costly in itself that the possibility
of illustration was almost beyond thought.

Only the wealthy could afford illustrated books and as their reading
was very limited, naturally illustration was crowded to the wall.

Those with money to spend on pictures preferred decorations or portraits,
consequently the endeavors of artists were aimed at supplying what
suited the tastes of buyers.

Illustration is and always has been the art of the people. It makes
clearer to the imagination their stories and their songs, it mirrors
their manner of life, interests, and pursuits in a way that brightens
what would otherwise often be commonplace.

Art seems to entwine itself about the strongest figures in a
community, absorbing with its nourishment the ethical qualities of
the leader.

"Then there was something at your window, too?"

"Something? A dozen! JOSHUA STEPHENS, Jr., (6), was the founder of that
particular line of the family of which we have any definite knowledge.
His father was Joshua Stephens, (3), the immigrant ancestor, who settled
in what is now Berkes County, Pennsylvania.

Berkes was then a "howling wilderness" full of Indians and wild
beasts.

It was here in 1733, that Joshua Stephens, Jr., was born.

Neighbors were like Angel's visits, "few and far between". In Amity
Township on the east lived Mordecai Lincoln, in A. D. 1725, the ancestor
of the illustrious President. In Exeter Township to the north-east
lived George Boone, in A. D. 1717, the ancestor of Daniel
Boone, the celebrated pioneer of Kentucky.

Our family tradition is that the Stephens and the Boones were
intermarried, and it is known that the Boones and Lincolns formed
such alliances.

(See Century Magazine for November, 1886). Joshua became an expert
in the use of the rifle.

His early life was spent on his father's farm and in hunting, in which
he became very proficient and for which he acquired considerable
notoriety.

Schools were scarce in those days and his literary education was
probably poor. No writings of his are known to be in existence to-day.
To his out-door life must be attributed the cause of his longevity,
extending to a period of ninety years.

He did not marry until he was 38 years of age. In 1771 he married
Priscilla Humphreys. The fact that she was a member of the Seventh-day
Baptist Church, who were then quite numerous in Chester County to the
South of Berkes, and that his son E. D. Stephens was born in Chester,
suggests that at an early date in his life Joshua left Berkes and
settled in Chester, which he did at any rate, and lived not far
from Valley Forge.

At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War he identified himself with
the patriot cause, and, according to the statement of his son, E. D.
Stephens, was commissioned Captain of a Company of sharpshooters.
During the famine of the American army in the winter of 1777-8 at
Valley Forge, he hauled corn to relieve their distress.

On one occasion he obtained a furlough to return home during harvest.
With a Quaker and his brother John he was in the orchard gathering
apples. The Quaker was up in the apple tree, picking fruit, and improved
the opportunity to expostulate with Joshua over the wickedness of
war, and arguing that Joshua should stay at home like his brother
John, the tory.

In the midst of his argument the Quaker fell out of the tree, and
striking the ground violently, broke his neck, and was picked up
dead.

This was regarded as an act of Divine Judgment in favor of the war,
and probably went far toward encouraging the despairing hearts of the
patriots about them.

A few years after the war he moved with his family to a place "near
the Warm Springs, Virginia," said E. D. Stephens.

Whether this was the Warm Springs in Bath County, is hard to determine.
"And then in a few years" said the same person, "to near LEXINGTON,
(Carlisle) Kentucky."

These residences are indefinitely located. "The Warm Springs" may have
been in what is now KENAWHA County, West Virginia for there are such
there, and according to Mr.

Jordan, above quoted, they lived "near a river, in the vicinity of the
residence of Daniel Boone," who lived in KENAWHA. (See Hale's
"Trans-Allegheny Pioneers").

It was while here, said Jordan, that Boone was a frequent visitor
to the place of Joshua, whom he invariably greeted as "Cousin." Just
what the relationship was is unknown, but it undoubtedly
existed. One evening Boone came to the Stephens' place, weary, and
said "Twenty-one less." They understood from this laconic remark,
that he referred to the number of Indians he had killed that day.

Joshua was accompanied or followed to "near Lexington" by two of his
brothers-in-law, Joshua and Jonathan Humphreys.

Here two of his sons left to find homes for themselves--David Humphreys,
(10), who settled in Evansville, Indiana, and Silas, (14), who
settled in Nashville, Tenn.

Katie, (12), a daughter died in Kentucky at a tender age.

It was while in Kentucky that he knocked a Dutchman down for insulting
his daughter Hannah, and dislocated his (Stephen's) thumb.

It must have been about 1798 when he decided to remove to near
Chillicothe, Ohio, for that year his son, E. D. Stephens was fourteen
years old, and was apprenticed to a tanner, which naturally was on
his mother's death. This occured while they were on the Pickaway Plains,
in Ohio. As they were travelling, the women of the party took off their
shoes to walk on the cool grass on account of the heat. His wife was
bitten by a copper-head snake, and shortly died, her body turning to
the color of the snake.

JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), was over six feet high, kept his face shaven
smoothly, had blue eyes and dark hair, and was powerful physically,
and kept a straight figure of his body until his death.

--Statement of Joshua Stephens, (32).

JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), a Revolutionary soldier and ancestor of the
Stephens family, was born in Union Township, Berkes County, Penn.,
in 1733.
His quiet, passionless voice sounded strange to me; his words seemed
strange, too, each one heavily weighted with hidden meaning.

We set the cage on the ground; he unlocked and opened the steel-barred
door, and, kneeling, carefully arranged the pies along the centre of
the cage.

"I have a curious presentiment," he said, "that I shall not come out
of this experiment unscathed."

"Don't, for Heaven's sake, say that!" I broke out, my nerves on edge
again.

"Why not?" he asked, surprised. "I am not afraid."

"Not afraid to die?" I demanded, exasperated.

"Who spoke of dying?" he inquired, mildly. The paper is then chosen for
the "end papers," usually matching closely the paper of the book.

They are cut a little larger than the paper page of the book,
and pasted along the edge to the outside and whip-stitched signatures.

Marble paper in suitable harmony or contrast with the leather
to be used on the book is then selected for lining the inside of
the covers cut to the same size as the "end papers," and pasted to
them, after having been folded so that the colored sides come face
to face.

When all this pasting has dried thoroughly, the back of the book is
covered with a thin coating of glue, to preserve its shape and then,
while the back is quite flat, the front edges of the leaves are
trimmed off evenly in a cutting machine.

If this edge is to be gilded, special care is taken to have the
edges cut smoothly.

The back is then "rounded" by use of a hammer; if the book is to be
a "flat back" one, the rounding is very slight. It is necessary even
in the case of a flat back book to round it somewhat so that it
will retain its shape when the finished book is placed on the shelf.

After the rounding, the top, or "head," and the bottom, or "tail," of
the book are trimmed evenly in the cutting machine.

The book is then ready for the gilder, who places it, with the edge which
is to be gilded uppermost, in a press. This edge is covered with red
chalk, which shows all the uneven places, which are then scraped
with a steel scraper. This operation is repeated until the edge
is very smooth, and it is then treated with a sizing made of white
of egg and water, which is to hold the gold leaf to the edges of
the leaves.

The gold leaf is laid on the still wet edge, and when slightly dry is
covered with a sheet of paper and rubbed down with a burnisher,
and when entirely dry is burnished again with a smooth piece of
agate or bloodstone.

The boards, pieces of strong and durable binders' "boards" made of
paper or tarred rope, are then selected and cut to fit the book,
extending about one-eighth of an inch over the head, tail, and front
edges of the leaves.

Each of the cords, on which the book has been sewed, is moistened with
paste, and put through two holes which are punched side by side
in the board and within a quarter of an inch of the inside edge.

The cord is carried down through one hole, and up through the other, and
the remaining end is cut off and hammered down smooth where it stays
firmly fastened by the paste. This is called "lacing on the boards"
and when finished makes, so far as strength is concerned, the cover-boards
and the inside of the book practically one piece.

The book is then given another long pressing.

The coverer then takes the volume. He first wraps the edges with paper
to keep them clean and then puts on the headbands.

These are either sewn directly on to the book or may be bought
ready-made, when they are put on with glue.

The back is covered with a strip of coarsely woven crash lined with
several pieces of paper.

This is glued to the back to make it hard and solid and to prevent it
from cracking, or "breaking," when the book is opened.

The leather is then cut out for the corners and for the back, in
the latter case allowance being made for its extension over and on
to the boards to the proper distance.

The back lining is trimmed off to the top of the headbands, and the
leather is pasted on the rough side in position and turned in at
the "head" and "tail" of the back.

The five raised bands are then "pinched up" and the whole back is
polished, or "crushed," with a hot polisher until the leather is
smoothed down to the desired surface.

In decorating the cover, or "tooling" it, as it is called, the
design is first pressed into the leather of the back with heated
tools.

These designs, appearing "blank," or sunken, in the leather, are
washed over with a thin coat of paste and water, followed by a
sizing of albumen, and finally with vaseline, to make the gold stick.

Gold leaf is laid over the "blank" designs and the same heated tools
used to press the gold into the leather. As many as three layers
of gold are frequently put on in this way until the design is full
and clear.

The waste edges of the pieces of gold leaf are removed with a piece
of soft rubber and the whole back washed with benzine to remove the
grease of the vaseline and that of the natural leather.

The part of the leather which projects over the sides is pasted to the
boards, trimmed off straight, and pared down until the edges
are very thin. Another piece of plain paper is then cut out and
pasted on the board, covering it right up to the edges of the leather.
This makes the side board and the leather even in height and
prevents the outside marbled paper from showing ridges made by the
edges of the leather.

When the outside has dried, a piece of paper is pasted on the inside
of each board.

This paper has a tendency to shrink a little and to warp the boards,
so that they will hold tightly to the inside of the book.

If this paper were not put on the inside of the covers, the marbled
paper on the outside might cause the boards to warp away from the
book itself.

The end papers are then pasted down on to the board, and when thoroughly
dry all the leather along the inside and the outside edges of the
cover sides is carefully washed and polished with an iron polisher.

The book is then placed between plates made of steel, either nickel or
silver plated, and placed in the press to remain a day or two, after
which the back is polished again and the sides are finished with
gilt lines along the edges of the leather next to the marbled
paper. Then the book is finally inspected, a silk marker inserted, and
the volume is done and ready for delivery.

COPYRIGHTING
By Frederick H.

Hitchcock.

Copyrighting a book is in most instances not a difficult matter, but
the present United States laws are so complicated and inconsistent
that an inexperienced author may readily fall into errors of one
kind or another.

In a modern publishing house, the routine work of complying with the
provisions of the copyright laws is usually in the hands of one
clerk, who is responsible for the preparation and filing of the
necessary documents at the proper time and for keeping a complete
record of all that he does.

Experience soon brings such a clerk a really valuable knowledge of
the law, but as many questions of vital importance arise from time
to time, it is customary for one of the most responsible men in
the concern, generally a member of the firm or an officer in the
corporation, to exercise a general supervision of all copyright
matters.

When a book is ready to be sent to the bindery, the manufacturing
department will generally order a certain number of copies to be
finished in advance of the rest of the edition.

Some of these will be for the travelling salesman's use, some for the
publicity department, and at least two for copyright purposes.

With the copies delivered to the copyright clerk, the manufacturing
department will send one or two separate title-pages, either torn
from the printed sheets or taken from the early proofs made by the
printer.

With these in hand and with information from the selling department as
to the day when the book is to be published, the clerk in charge
will then take the first step toward copyrighting it.

This is the filing of the claim for copyright and of the title of
the book.

The Copyright Office in the Library of Congress at Washington
supplies free upon request application blanks, and one of these must
be carefully filled in.

The information called for by this blank is as follows: the
amount of the fees enclosed, whether a sealed copy of the record, or
certificate as it is called, is desired, whether the volume is to
be classed as a book, periodical, or dramatic composition, an
abbreviated title of the book, the name of the author, or proprietor,
the name and address of the applicant, the name of the country where
the book was printed, whether the applicant is the author, or (having
an assignment from the author) the proprietor, the name of the
country of which the author is a citizen, or subject, and whether
the whole or a part of the book is sought to be copyrighted.

There is a blank page in the form where the print or proof of the
title-page must be pasted.

If neither of these is available at the time, it is customary to use
a typewritten title-page, but as the law distinctly calls for a
"printed" title and as the courts have not decided whether typewriting
is printing within the intention of the law, it is best to follow
the exact letter of the law.

The fee for filing the application or claim for copyright is fifty
cents if the author is a citizen or resident of the United States,
or one dollar if he is a foreigner.

If a copy of the record entered at the Copyright Office is desired, an
additional fifty cents is required. The fees, preferably in the form
of a money-order, are enclosed in the envelope containing the
claim, and the whole forwarded, postage prepaid, to the Register
of Copyrights at the Library of Congress.

Upon receiving these, the Copyright Office will acknowledge the receipt
of the fees and make a record of the claim and of the title in
books provided for the purpose.

The law specifies that this record shall be in the following words:--

"Library of Congress, to wit: Be it remembered that on the___day
of________190________________ of_________has deposited in this
Office the title of a BOOK, the title of which is in the following
words, to wit:____________, the right whereof_______ claims as
author and proprietor in conformity with the laws of the United
States respecting copyrights.

______________Librarian of Congress."
It is generally the custom to obtain a copy of this record, which,
if the fee is enclosed, is sent to the claimant as soon after the
receipt of the application as it can be made out in the regular
course of the business of the Copyright Office.

This copy is signed by the Register of Copyrights and is sealed with
the official seal of the Library of Congress. The period of protection
under an original claim is twenty-eight years.

It is important to remember that the application and the title are
required by law to be delivered to the Register of Copyrights "on
or before the day of publication in this or any other country."

If delayed until after that day, the book cannot have the protection of
the copyright law.

Prior to 1891 none but citizens or residents of the United States
could obtain copyright, but in July of that year the privilege was
extended to the citizens, or subjects, of such other countries as
grant to the citizens of the United States the same copyright
privileges which they afford to their own countrymen.

At the present time these privileged countries are Belgium, France,
Great Britain and her possessions, Switzerland, Germany, Italy,
Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, the Netherlands
(Holland) and her possessions, Cuba, China, and Norway.

The law also requires that a book desired to be copyrighted
in the United States must be printed in this country. It is, therefore,
not possible to copyright a book which has been put into type and
electrotyped in England and sent here for the presswork and
binding.

Copies of a book manufactured in this country may, however, be sent
to England and copyrighted there.

The second step is to send two copies of the printed book for deposit
in the Copyright Office, and until this has been done, the copyright
is incomplete.

These copies, like the title, must be delivered on or before the day
of publication.

A printed receipt-form for books to be deposited is supplied by the
Copyright Office, and it is the usual practice for the sender to
fill in his address, and the names of the book and of the author,
so that when the books are received, the Register of Copyrights
needs only to date and sign the receipt-form and return it to the
sender.

This receipt-form should be enclosed with the books when they are
forwarded. The package must be plainly addressed (the Copyright
Office furnishes printed labels if desired) and sent, carriage
prepaid, through the mail.

It not infrequently happens that publication must be made before the
two copies of a book can reach Washington. In such cases the copyright
clerk may take the books to the nearest post-office and obtain
from the postmaster a dated receipt for them which is equivalent
to delivery to the Copyright Office.

The package is not finally wrapped until the postmaster has examined
it.

When these steps have been properly taken, and the certificate, or
sealed copy, of the record and the receipt for the two copies have
been received, the copyright is secure so far as our laws can render
it.

It should be borne in mind that the Copyright Office does not grant a
copyright in a manner similar to the granting of a patent right
by the patent office.

Its function is simply to record in a permanent place and in official
form the claim made by the author, or by the proprietor, of that
right.

       When a book is "pirated" and the offender sued, it must first be
established by the records that the provisions of the law have been
complied with fully and correctly.

In this way a copyright is always subject to review by the courts.

Every copy of a book for which copyright has been claimed must have a
formal notice to that effect, printed on its "title-page or
on the page following."

As prescribed by law, this notice must read either "Entered according
to the Act of Congress in the year 1906 by A. B. in the Office
of the Library of Congress," or simply, "Copyright, 1906, by A. B."
The omission of such a notice from the book would make it impossible
for its owner to prevent its being reprinted. There is a penalty of
$100 for using the notice of copyright in an uncopyrighted book, and
when the notice is used, there is a penalty of $25, if the two copies
as required by law are not deposited. This latter penalty also applies
in the case of failure to deposit one copy of a new edition differing
from the former one, if a notice of copyright is used in the
new edition.

In order to obtain a renewal of a copyright, the claim and the title
must be filed on a form provided for the purpose with the Register of
Copyrights "within six months before the expiration of the first
term," which would be sometime between twenty-seven and one-half
and twenty-eight years from the date of filing the original title.

The copyright period runs from the date of filing the original claim,
and not from the time of depositing the books, and great care should
be taken to ascertain the date of the registration of the original
title, and to compute the time so that the filing of the application
for renewal will surely fall within the specified six months.

The renewal period is fourteen years, and the fees are the same
as in the case of the original application, but a certificate,
or copy of the record, of the renewal claim must be taken and paid
for by the claimant.

Only one copy of a book is required to be deposited to complete the
claim for a renewal term of copyright.

This copy also must be delivered within "six months before the expiration
of the first term," and should be accompanied by a receipt as in the
case of the original deposit. In order to complete the claim, a
copy of the certificate must be published verbatim, within two
months of the date of renewal for four weeks in one or more newspapers
printed in the United States.

In obtaining international copyright, publication on the same day here
and abroad is necessary, and this is sometimes a cause of considerable
inconvenience in actual practice. When a New York publisher wishes to
copyright in England a novel which he is about to publish, he must
prepare six special copies of the finished book, bind them in cloth,
print the copyright notice on the back of the title-page, and the
name and address of the London firm or the individual who is willing
to act as the English publisher of the book, and forward the copies
to that person.

At the same time he will write to this agent, telling him of the shipment
and requesting him to enter the book for copyright and publish it in
England on or about such a date. He will, of course, allow sufficient
time for the books to reach London, and he will carefully point out
in his letter any American holidays which occur near the probable
date of publication.

Upon receiving the books, the London agent will cable the New
York publisher the date on which he will publish the book, taking care
to allow an interval of a day or two, because of a possible delay.

On the day agreed upon, the New York publisher proceeds to copyright
and publish his book in this country in the usual manner, while
the London agent does the same abroad, delivering to the British
Museum one copy of the book, and to Stationer's Hall, for use in
certain libraries, four copies.

Both of them will on that day sell at least one or two copies which
will constitute a legal publication.

It is the custom with many publishers to establish the publication day
of all of their books, by displaying a few copies, or by actually
selling one or more copies to some one. In the case of a very popular
copyrighted book which it is desirable to have the retailers all over
the country begin to sell on the same day, it is deemed safer
to make this technical publication before any of the books are
distributed through the trade.

    A record of
     the first sales entered in a publisher's sales-book in the course
of business would effectually prevent any one from claiming in after
years a right to reprint a book on the ground that the claim, title,
and copies were not originally filed until after the book had been
put upon the market.

Under a recent amendment in our law, an author of a book in a foreign
language, who is a citizen of one of the foreign countries which
allows to our citizens the same copyright privileges as are allowed
to its own countrymen, is permitted to file in the Copyright Office
within thirty days after its publication in a foreign country a
copy of his book with a formal declaration that he is the author
and that he intends to translate it or to print it in its original
language and to apply for copyright in the United States.

After doing this, he is allowed one year in which to complete his
proposed translation or to print it in the original language and copyright
it here.

Before this statute was passed, two or more persons could translate
a foreign book, and each could copyright his own translation.

Every copy of a book for which such protection is desired under
this law must bear a notice stating, "Published ---- Nineteen Hundred
and ----.

XLV.***** BEHIND THE SCENES; OR, A BREAKFAST IN NEWGATE. Returning
from the country, I found myself in the Old Bailey, shortly after
seven in the morning.

I had some difficulty in making my way through the crowd there
assembled, which I instantly perceived, from the platform erected

doing so compelled a pause little circle round the anvil, in which
the main objects in the scene before me on which a scaffold evinced,

the writer remarks, with indignation, that the brutal populace
diverted themselves with the animal's distress, as if they had come
there to see" a sow baited,"" instead of attending to behold a
fellow creature sacrificed to justice.

But the pressure of the accumulating thousands was too much for me,
and I asked a female, who, with an infant in her arms, stood full
in my way, to let me pass.

I was retiring, when the carriage of one of the sheriffs drove up
to the Sessions-house, and out stepped my friend Sir Thomas----,
who, in the performance of his who were to die.

I was instantly recognised, and the sheriff kindly complimented devil
me with the offer of an introduction to the interior.

Such politenesss was not to be withstood, and I signified my assent
with a bow.

We passed up a staircase and into a well furnished and carpeted
apartment.

Here I was introduced to the under-sheriff, who, attended by half
a dozen gentlemen, brought in, like myself, as a matter Some

He added, with infinite coolness and intelligence--" But you cannot

The approach of the prisoners was signified first by a whisper, and
then by the clanking of the irons attached to the limbs of one of
them.

It was a dreary morning; and the sombre aspect of the well accorded
with the dismal preparations of which it was to be the theatre.

character of the preparations presented itself.

"'No, it won't,' said I, laughing; 'but my hand will shake if I don't

daughter. 'Daisy, give him my best cigars--put the box here on the

"Miss Holroyd rose and crossed the hallway to her father's room,
returning presently with a box of promising-looking cigars.

"'I don't think he knows what is good for him,' she said. 'He should
smoke only one every day.'

"It was hard to bear. I am not vindictive, but I decided to treasure
up a few of Miss Holroyd's gentle taunts. My intimacy with her brother
was certainly a disadvantage to me now. Jack had apparently been
talking too much, and his sister appeared to be thoroughly acquainted
with my past. It was a disadvantage. I remembered her vaguely as a
girl with long braids, who used to come on Sundays with her father and
take tea with us in our rooms. Then she went to Germany to school, and
Jack and I employed our Sunday evenings otherwise. It is true that I
regarded her weekly visits as a species of infliction, but I did not
think I ever showed it.

"'It is strange,' said I, 'that you did not recognize me at once, Miss
Holroyd. Have I changed so greatly in five years?'

There is one mechanical feature which has an important bearing upon
the foregoing question, and which it is one of the tester's duties
to investigate.

This is illustrated in Fig. 71, which shows a turbine spindle
projecting through the casing.

The gland box is let into the casing as shown. Brass rings A
calked into the gland box encircle the shaft on either side of the
annular steam space S.

As the clearance between the turbine spindle and the rings A is in a
measure instrumental in determining the amount of steam required
to maintain a required pressure inside the chamber, it is obvious
that this clearance should be minimum.

An unnecessarily large clearance means a proportionally large increase
in gland steam consumption and _vice versa_.

[Illustration: FIG. 71]
When the turbine glands are sealed with water, all water leakage which
takes place into the turbine, and ultimately to the condenser
hot-well, must be measured and subtracted from the hot-well contents
at the end of a test.

The foregoing remarks would not apply to those cases in which the gland
supply is drawn from and returned to the hot-well, or a pipe leading
from the hot-well.

Then no correction would be necessary, as all water used for gland
purposes might be assumed as being taken from the measuring tanks
and returned again in time for same or next weighing or
measurement.

General Considerations
There are a few principal elementary points which it is necessary
always to keep in mind during the conduct of a test.

Among these are the effects of variation in vacuum, superheat,
initial steam pressure, and, as already indicated, in load.

There exist many rules for determining the corrections necessitated
by this variation.

For example, it is often assumed that 9 degrees Fahrenheit, excess
or otherwise, above or below that specified, represents an increase
or reduction in efficiency of about 1 per cent.

It is probable that the percentage increase or decrease in steam
consumption, in the case of superheat, can be more reliably calculated
than in other cases, as, for example, vacuum; but the increase
cannot be said to be due solely to the variation in superheat.

In other words, the individuality of the particular turbine being
tested always contributes something, however small this something
may be, to the results obtained.

These remarks are particularly applicable where vacuum is concerned.

Here again rules exist, one of these being that every additional
inch of vacuum increases the economy of the turbine by something
slightly under half a pound of steam per kilowatt-hour.

But a moment's consideration convinces one of the utter unreliability
of such rules for general application.

It is, for instance, well known that many machines, when under test,
have demonstrated that the total increase in the water rate is
very far from constant.

A machine tested, for example, gave approximately the following
results, the object of the test being to discover the total increase
in the water rate per inch decrease in vacuum:
From 27 inches to 26 inches, 4.5 per cent.

From 26.2 inches to 24.5 inches, 2.5 per cent.

This illustrates to what an extent the ratio of increase can vary,
and it must be borne in mind that it is very probable that the
variation is different in different types and sizes of machines.

There can exist, therefore, no empirical rules of a reliable nature
upon which the tester can base his deductions.

The only way calculated to give satisfaction is to conduct a series
of preliminary tests upon the turbine undergoing observation, and
from these to deduce all information of the nature required, which
can be permanently recorded in a set of curves for reference during
the final official tests.

In conclusion, it must be admitted that many published tests outlining
the performances of certain makes of turbine are unreliable. To
determine honestly the capabilities of any machine in the direction
of steam economy is an operation requiring time, and unbiased and
accurate supervision. By means of such assets as "floating quantities,"
short tests during exceptionally favorable conditions, and disregard
of the vital necessity of running a test under the proper specified
conditions, it is comparatively easy to obtain results apparently
highly satisfactory, but which under other conditions might be just
the reverse.

These considerations are, however, unworthy of the tester proper.

VII. AUXILIARIES FOR STEAM TURBINES[6]

[6] Contributed to _Power_ by Thomas Franklin.

The Jet Condenser
The jet condenser illustrated in Fig. 72 is singularly well adapted
for the turbine installation.

As the type has not been so widely adopted as the more common forms
of jet condenser and the surface types, it may prove of interest
to describe briefly its general construction and a few of its special
features in relation to tests.

[Illustration: FIG. 72]
Referring to the figure, C is the main condenser body.

Exhaust steam enters at the left-hand side through the pipe E,
condensing water issuing through the pipe D at the opposite side.

Passing through the short conical pipe P, the condensing water
enters the cylindrical chamber W and falls directly upon the
spraying cone S.

The hight of this spraying cone is determined by the tension upon the
spring T, below the piston R, the latter being connected to the
cone by a spindle L.

An increase of the water pressure inside the chamber W will thus
compress the spring, and the spraying cone being consequently lowered
increases the aperture between it and the sloping lower wall of the
chamber W, allowing a greater volume of water to be sprayed.

The piston R incidentally prevents water entering the top vapor chamber
V.

From the foregoing it can be seen that this condenser is of the
contra-flow type, the entering steam coming immediately into contact
with the sprayed water.

The perforated diaphragm plate F allows the vapor to rise into the
chamber V, from which it is drawn through the pipe A to the air pump.

A relief valve U prevents an excessive accumulation of pressure in
the vapor chamber, this valve being obviously of delicate construction,
capable of opening upon a very slight increase of the internal
pressure over that of the atmosphere.

Condensed steam and circulating water are together carried down
the pipe B to the well Z, from which a portion may be carried off as
feed water, and the remainder cooled and passed through the condenser
again.

Under any circumstances, whether the air pump is working or not,
a certain percentage of the vapor in the condenser is always carried
down the pipe B, and this action alone creates a partial vacuum, thus
rendering the work of the air pump easier.

As a matter of fact, a fairly high vacuum can be maintained with the
air pump closed down, and only the indirect pumping action of the
falling water operating to rarify the contents of the condenser
body.

It is customary to place the condenser forty or more feet above
the circulating-water pump, the latter usually being a few feet below
the turbine.

Features Demanding Attention

When operating a condenser of this type, the most important features
requiring preliminary inspection and regulation while running
are:

(a) Circulating-water regulation.

(b) Freedom of all mechanical parts of spraying mechanism.

(c) Relief-valve regulation.

(d) Water-cooling arrangements.

The tester will, however, devote his attention to a practical survey
of the condenser and its auxiliaries, before running operations
commence.

A preliminary vacuum test ought to be conducted upon the condenser body,
and the exhaust piping between the condenser and turbine.

To accomplish this the circulating-water pipe D can be filled with
water to the condenser level.

The relief valve should also be water-sealed.

Any existing leakage can thus be located and stopped.

Having made the condenser as tight as possible within practical limits,
vacuum might be again raised and, with the same parts sealed, allowed
to fall slowly for, say, ten minutes. A similar test over an equal
period may then be conducted with the relief valve not water-sealed.
A comparison of the times taken for an equal fall of vacuum in inches,
under the different conditions, during the above two tests, will reveal
the extent of the leakage taking place through the relief valve. It
seems superfluous to add that the fall of vacuum in both the
foregoing tests must not be accelerated in any way, but must be a
result simply of the slight inevitable leakage which is to be found
in every system.

On a comparatively steady load, and with consequently only small
fluctuation in the volume of steam to be condensed, the conditions
are most favorable for regulating the amount of circulating water
necessary.
Naturally, an excess of water above the required minimum will not
affect the pressure conditions inside the condenser. It does, however,
increase the quantity of water to be handled from the hot-well,
and incidentally lowers the temperature there, which, whether the
feed-water pass through economizers or otherwise, is not advisable
from an economical standpoint.

Thus there is an economical minimum of circulating water to be aimed
at, and, as previously stated, it can best be arrived at by running
the turbine under normal load and adjusting the flow of the
circulating water by regulating the main valve and the tension upon
the spring T.

Under abnormal conditions, the breakdown of an air pump, or
the sudden springing of a bad leak, for instance, the amount of
circulating water can be increased by a farther opening of the main
valve if necessary, and a relaxation of the spring tension by hand;
or, the spring tension might be automatically changed immediately
upon the vacuum falling.

The absolute freedom of all moving parts of the spraying mechanism
should be one of the tester's first assurances.

To facilitate this, it is customary to construct the parts,
with the exception of the springs, of brass or some other non-corrosive
metal.

The spraying cone must be thoroughly clean in every channel, to
insure a well-distributed stream of water. Nor is it less important
that careful attention be given to the setting and operation of
the relief valve, as will be seen later.
The obvious object of such a valve is to prevent the internal
condenser pressure ever being maintained much higher than the
atmospheric pressure.

A number of carefully designed rubber flap valves, or one large one,
have been found to act successfully for this purpose, although a
balanced valve of more substantial construction would appear to be
more desirable.

Importance of Relief Valves
The question of relief valves in turbine installations is an important
one, and it seems desirable at this point to draw attention to
another necessary relief valve and its function, namely the turbine
atmospheric valve.

As generally understood, this is placed between the turbine and condenser,
and, should the pressure in the latter, owing to any cause, rise
above that of the atmosphere, it opens automatically and allows the
exhaust steam to flow through it into the atmosphere, or into another
condenser.

A general diagrammatic arrangement of a steam turbine, condenser,
and exhaust piping is shown in Fig. 73.

Connected to the exhaust pipe B, near to the condenser, is the
automatic atmospheric valve D, from which leads the exhaust piping
E to the atmosphere.

The turbine relief valve is shown at F, and the condenser relief valve
at G. The main exhaust valve between turbine and condenser is seen
at H.

We have here three separate relief valves: one, F, to prevent excessive
pressure in the turbine: the second, D, an atmospheric valve opening
a path to the air, and, in addition to preventing excessive pressure
accumulating, also helping to keep the temperature of the condenser
body and tubes low; the third, the condenser relief valve G, which
in itself ought to be capable of exhausting all steam from the
turbine, should occasion demand it.

[Illustration: FIG. 73]
Assuming a plant of this description to be operating favorably, the
conditions would of necessity be as follows: The valves F, D, and
G, all closed; the valve H open.

Suppose that, owing to sudden loss of circulating water, the vacuum
fell to zero. The condenser would at once fill with steam, a slight
pressure would be set up, and whichever of the three valves happened
to be set to blow off at the lowest pressure would do so. Now it is
desirable that the first valve to open under such circumstances should
be the atmospheric valve D. This being so, the condenser would
remain full of steam at atmospheric pressure until the attendant
had had time to close the main hand-or motor-operated exhaust valve
H, which he would naturally do before attempting to regain the
circulation of the condensing water.

Again, assume the installation to be running under the initial
conditions, with the atmospheric valve D and all remaining valves
except H closed.

Suppose the vacuum again fell to zero from a similar cause, and,
further, suppose the atmospheric valve D failed to operate automatically.
The only valves now capable of passing the exhaust steam are the
turbine and condenser relief valves F and G.

Inasmuch as the pressures at exhaust in the turbine proper, on
varying load, vary over a considerably greater range than the small
fairly constant absolute pressures inside the condenser, it is
obviously necessary to allow for this factor in the respective
setting of these two relief valves.

In other words, the obvious deduction is to set the turbine relief
valve to blow off at a higher pressure than the condenser relief
valve, even when considering the question with respect to condensing
conditions only.

In this second hypothetical case, then, with a closed and disabled
atmospheric valve, the exhaust must take place through the condenser,
until the turbine can be shut down, or the circulating water
regained without the former course being found necessary.

There is one other remote case which may be assumed, namely, the
simultaneous refusal of both atmospheric and condenser relief
valves to open, upon the vacuum inside the condenser being entirely
lost.

The exhaust would then be blown through the turbine relief valve
F, until the plant could be closed down.

Although the conditions just cited are highly improbable in
actual practice, it can at once be seen that to insure the safety
of the condenser, absolutely, the turbine relief valve must be set
to open at a comparatively low pressure, say 40 pounds by gage, or
thereabouts.

To set it much lower than this would create a possibility of its leaking
when the turbine was making a non-condensing run, and when the pressure
at the turbine exhaust end is often above that of the atmosphere.

From every point of view, therefore, it is advisable to make a minute
examination of all relief valves in a system, and before a test
to insure that these valves are all set to open at their correct
relative pressures.

It must be admitted that the practice of placing a large relief
valve upon a condenser in addition to the atmospheric exhausting
valve is by no means common. The latter valve, where
surface condensing is adopted, is often thought sufficient, working
in conjunction with a quickly operated main exhaust valve.
Similarly, with a barometric condenser as that illustrated in Fig.
72, the atmospheric exhaust valve D (seen in Fig. 73) is sometimes
dispensed with.

This course is, however, objectionable, for upon a loss of vacuum
in the turbine, all exhaust steam must pass through the condenser
body, or the entire plant be closed down until the vacuum is regained.

The simple construction of the barometric condenser, however, is
in such an event much to its advantage, and the passage of the hot
steam right through it is not likely to seriously warp or strain
any of its parts, as might probably happen in the case of a surface
condenser.

The question of the advisability of thus adding to a plant can only
be fairly decided when all conditions, operating and otherwise, are
fully known.

For example, if we assume a large turbine to be operating on a
greatly varying load, and exhausting into a condenser, as that in
Fig.
72, and, further, having an adequate stand-by to back it up, one's
obvious recommendation would be to equip the installation with both
a condenser relief valve and an atmospheric valve, in addition, of
course, to the main exhaust valve, which is always placed between
the atmospheric valve and condenser.

There are still other considerations, such as water supply, condition
of circulating water, style of pump, etc., which must all necessarily
have an obvious bearing upon the settlement of this question; so
that generalization is somewhat out of place, the final design in
all cases depending solely upon general principles and local
conditions.

Other Necessary Features of a Test
In connection with the condenser, of any type, and its
auxiliaries, there remain a few necessary examinations and operations
to be conducted, if it is desired to obtain the very best
results during the test.

It will be sufficient to just outline them, the method of procedure being
well known, and the requirement of any strict routine being
unnecessary.

These include:

(1) A thorough examination of the air-pump, and, if possible, an equally
careful examination of diagrams taken from it when running on full
load.

Also careful examination of the piping, and of any other connections
between the air pump and condenser, or other auxiliaries.

It will be well in this examination to note the general "lay" of the
air pipes, length, hight to which they rise above condenser and
air pump, facilities for drainage, etc., as this information may
prove valuable in determining the course necessary to rectify
deficiencies which may later be found to exist

.

(2) In a surface condenser, inspection of the pumps delivering
condensed steam to the measuring tanks or hot-well; inspection of
piping between the condenser and the pump, and also between the pump
and measuring tanks. If these pumps are of the centrifugal type it
is essential to insure, for the purposes of a steam-consumption
test, as much regularity of delivery as possible

.

(3) In the case of a consumption test upon a turbine exhausting
into a barometric condenser, and where the steam consumed is being
measured by the evaporation in the boiler over the test period,
time must be devoted to the feed-pipes between the feed-water
measuring meter or tank and the boilers.

Under conditions similar to those operating in a plant such as that
shown in Fig. 72, the necessary boiler feed might be drawn from
the hot-well, the remainder of the hot-well contents probably being
pumped through water coolers, or towers, for circulating through
the condenser.

With the very best system, it is possible for a slight quantity of
oil to leak into the exhaust steam, and thence to the hot-well.

In its passage, say along wooden conduits, to the measuring tank
or meter, this water would probably pass through a number of filters.

The efficiency of these must be thoroughly insured.

It is unusual, in those cases where a simple turbine steam-consumption
test is being carried out, and not an efficiency test of a complete
plant, to pass the measured feed-water through economizers.

Should the latter course, owing to special conditions, become necessary,
a careful examination of all economizer pipes would be necessary

.

temperature-gage holes, etc., as to cleanliness, non-accumulation
of scale, etc.

Special Auxiliaries Necessary

Having outlined the points of interest and importance in connection with
the more permanent features of a plant, we arrive at the preparation
and fitting of those special auxiliaries necessary to carry on the
test.

[Illustration: FIG. 74]

It is customary, when carrying out a first test, upon both prime
mover and auxiliaries, to place every important stage in the expansion
in communication with a gage, so that the various pressures may be
recorded and later compared with the figures of actual requirement.

To do this, in the case of the turbine, it is necessary to bore
holes in the cover leading to the various expansion chambers, and
into each of these holes to screw a short length of steam pipe,
having preferably a loop in its length, to the other end of which
the gage is attached.

Fig. 74 illustrates, diagrammatically, a complete turbine installation,
and shows the various points along the course taken by the steam
at which it is desirable to place pressure gages.

The figure does not show the high-pressure steam pipe, nor any of
the turbine valves.

With regard to these, it will be desirable to place a steam gage
in the pipe, immediately before the main stop-valve, and another
immediately after it.

Any fall of pressure between the two sides of the valve can thus
be detected.

To illustrate this clearly, Fig. 75 is given, showing the valves
of a turbine, and the position of the gages connected to them.

The two gages E and F on either side of the main stop-valve A are
also shown.

The steam after passing through the valve, which, in the case of small
turbines, is hand-operated, goes in turn through the automatic
stop-valve B, the function of which is to automatically shut steam
off should the turbine attain a predetermined speed above the normal,
the steam strainer C, and finally through the governing valve D
into the turbine.

Strings of black surf-ducks passed, their strong
wings tipping the surface of the water; single wandering coots whirled
from the breakers into lonely flight towards the horizon.

When water is expensive and the overflow must be avoided, a small
float may be used as in Fig. 46, the ordinary tank used by plumbers for
closets, etc., serving the purpose admirably.

When the same water that is supplied to the glands is used
for the oil-cooling coils, which will be described in detail later,
the coils may be attached to either of the above arrangements as
shown in Fig. 47.

[Illustration: FIG. 47]
When the only available supply of pure water is that for the boiler
feed, and the condensed steam is pumped directly back to the boiler,
as shown in Fig. 48, the delivery from the condensed-water pumps may
be carried to an elevation 10 feet above the axis of the glands, where
a tank should be provided of sufficient capacity that the water may
have time to cool considerably before being used.

In most of these cases, if so desired, the oil-cooling water may come
from the circulating pumps of the condenser, provided there is
sufficient pressure to produce circulation, as is also shown in
Fig. 48.

[Illustration: FIG. 48]
When the turbine is required to exhaust against a back pressure of
one or two pounds a slightly different arrangement of piping must
be made.

The water in this case must be allowed to circulate through the
glands in order to keep the temperature below 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

If this is not done the water in the glands will absorb heat from the
main castings of the machine and will evaporate.

This evaporation will make the glands appear as though they were
leaking badly.

In reality it is nothing more than the water in the glands boiling,
but it is nevertheless equally objectionable.

This may be overcome by the arrangement shown in Fig. 49, where two
connections and valves are furnished at M and N, which drain away
to any suitable tank or sewer.

These valves are open just enough to keep sufficient circulation so
that there is no evaporation going on, which is evidenced by steam
coming out as though the glands were leaking.

These circulating valves may be used with any of the arrangements
above described.

[Illustration: FIG. 49]

The Governor

On the right-hand end of the main shaft in Fig. 34 there will be
seen a worm gear driving the governor.

This is shown on a larger scale at A (Fig. 50). At the left of the
worm gear is a bevel gear driving the spindle D of the governor, and
at the right an eccentric which gives a vibratory motion to the
lever F.

The crank C upon the end of the shaft operates the oil pump.

The speed of the turbine is controlled by admitting the steam in puffs
of greater or less duration according to the load. The lever F, having
its fulcrum in the collar surrounding the shaft, operates with
each vibration of the eccentric the pilot valve.

The valve is explained in detail later.

[Illustration: FIG. 50]

This form of governor has been superseded by an improved type, but
so many have been made that it will be well to describe its
construction and adjustment.

The two balls W W (Fig. 50) are mounted on the ends of bell cranks N,
which rest on knife edges.

The other end of the bell cranks carry rollers upon which rest a plate
P, which serves as a support for the governor spring S.

They are also attached by links to a yoke and sleeve E which acts
as a fulcrum for the lever F. The governor is regulated by
means of the spring S resting on the plate P and compressed by a
large nut G on the upper end of the governor spindle, which nut
turns on a threaded quill J, held in place by the nut H on the end
of the governor spindle and is held tight by the lock-nut K.

To change the compression of the spring and thereby the speed of the
turbine the lock-nut must first be loosened and the hand-nut
raised to lower the speed or lowered to raise the speed as the
case may be.

This operation may be accomplished while the machine is either running
or at rest.

The plate P rests upon ball bearings so that by simply bringing pressure
to bear upon the hand-wheel, which is a part of the quill J, the
spring and lock-nut may be held at rest and adjusted while the
rest of the turbine remains unaffected.

Another lever is mounted upon the yoke E on the pin shown at I,
the other end of which is fastened to the piston of a dash-pot so
as to dampen the governor against vibration.

Under the yoke E will be noticed a small trigger M which is used
to hold the governor in the full-load position when the turbine is
at rest.

The throwing out of the weights elevates the sleeve E, carrying
with it the collar C, which is spanned by the lever F upon the shaft
H.

The later turbines are provided with an improved form of governor
operating on the same principle, but embodying several important
features.

First, the spindle sleeve is integral with the governor yoke, and the
whole rotates about a vertical stationary spindle, so that two motions
are encountered--a rotary motion and an up and down motion, according
to the position taken by the governor. This spiral motion almost
entirely eliminates the effect of friction of rest, and thereby
enhances the sensitiveness of the governor. Second, the governor weights
move outward on a parallel motion opposed directly by spring thrust,
thus relieving the fulcrum entirely of spring thrust.

Third, the lay shaft driving the governor oil pump and reciprocator
is located underneath the main turbine shaft, so that the rotor may
be readily removed without in the least disturbing the governor
adjustment.

The Valve-Gear
The valve-gear is shown in section in Fig. 51, the main admission
being shown at V{1} at the right, and the secondary V{2} at the left
of the steam inlet. The pilot valve F receives a constant
reciprocating motion from the eccentric upon the layshaft of the
turbine through the lever F (Fig. 50).

These reciprocations run from 150 to 180 per minute. The space beneath
the piston C is in communication with the large steam chest, where
exists the initial pressure through the port A; the admission of
steam to the piston C being controlled by a needle valve B.

The pilot valve connects the port E, leading from the space beneath the
piston to an exhaust port I.

[Illustration: FIG. 51]
When the pilot valve is closed, the pressures can accumulate beneath
the piston C and raise the main admission valve from its seat.

When the pilot valve opens, the pressure beneath the piston is
relieved and it is seated by the helical spring above.

If the fulcrum E (Fig. 50) of the lever F were fixed the admission
would be of an equal and fixed duration.

But if the governor raises the fulcrum E, the pilot valve F (Fig. 51)
will be lowered, changing the relations of the openings with the
working edges of the ports.

The seating of the main admission valve is cushioned by the
dashpot, the piston of which is shown in section at G (Fig. 51).
The valve may be opened by hand by means of the lever K, to see if
it is perfectly free.

The secondary valve is somewhat different in its action.

Steam is admitted to both sides of its actuating piston through the
needle valves M M, and the chamber from which this steam is taken
is connected with the under side of the main admission valve, so
that no steam can reach the actuating piston of the secondary valve
until it has passed through the primary valve.

When the pilot valve is closed, the pressures equalize above and
below the piston N and the valve remains upon its seat.

When the load upon the turbine exceeds its rated capacity, the pilot
valve moves upward so as to connect the space above the piston with
the exhaust L, relieving the pressure upon the upper side and
allowing the greater pressure below to force the valve open, which
admits steam to the secondary stage of the turbine.

It would do no good to admit more steam to the first stage, for at
the rated capacity that stage is taking all the steam for which the
blade area will afford a passage.

The port connecting the upper side of the piston N with the exhaust
may be permanently closed by means of the hand valve Q, to be found
on the side of the secondary pilot valve chest, thus cutting the
secondary valve entirely out of action.

No dashpot is necessary on this valve, the compression of the steam
in the chamber W by the fall of the piston being sufficient to
avoid shock.

The timing of the secondary valve is adjusted by raising or lowering the
pilot valve by means of the adjustment provided.

It should open soon enough so that there will not be an appreciable
drop in speed before the valve comes into play.

The economy of the machine will be impaired if the valve is allowed to
open too soon.

Safety Stop Governor
This device is mounted on the governor end of the turbine shaft, as
shown in Figs. 52 and 53.

When the speed reaches a predetermined limit, the plunger A, having its
center of gravity slightly displaced from the center of rotation
of the shaft, is thrown radially outward and strikes the lever B.

It will easily be understood that when the plunger starts outward,
the resistance of spring C is rapidly overcome, since the
centrifugal force increases as the square of the radius, or in this
case the eccentricity of the center of gravity relative to the
center of rotation.

Hence, the lever is struck a sharp blow.

This releases the trip E on the outside of the governor casing, and
so opens the steam valve F, which releases steam from beneath the
actuating piston of a quick-closing throttle valve, located in the
steam line. Thus, within a period of usually less than one second, the
steam is entirely shut off from the turbine when the speed has
exceeded 7 or 8 per cent of the normal.

[Illustration: FIG. 52]
[Illustration: FIG. 53]

The Oiling System

Mounted on the end of the bedplate is the oil pump, operated from
the main shaft of the turbine as previously stated.

This may be of the plunger type shown in Fig. 54, or upon the latest
turbine, the rotary type shown in Fig. 55. Around the bedplate are
located the oil-cooling coils, the oil strainer, the oil reservoir
and the oil pipings to the bearing.

[Illustration: FIG. 54]
The oil reservoir, cooler, and piping are all outside the machine
and easily accessible for cleaning. Usually a corrugated-steel floor
plate covers all this apparatus, so that it will not be unsightly and
accumulate dirt, particularly when the turbine is installed, so that
all this apparatus is below the floor level; i.e., when the top of the
bedplate comes flush with the floor line. In cases where the turbine
is set higher, a casing is usually built around this material so
that it can be easily removed, and forms a platform alongside the
machine.

[Illustration: FIG. 55]
The oil cooler, shown in Fig. 56, is of the counter-current type, the
water entering at A and leaving at B, oil entering at C (opening not
shown) and leaving at D. The coils are of seamless drawn copper,
and attached to the cover by coupling the nut. The water manifold F is
divided into compartments by transverse ribs, each compartment
connecting the inlet of each coil with the outlet of the preceding
coil, thus placing all coils in series. These coils are removable in
one piece with the coverplate without disturbing the rest of the oil
piping.

[Illustration: FIG. 56]

Blading
[Illustration: FIG. 57]
The blades are drawn from a rod consisting of a steel core coated with
copper so intimately connected with the other metal that when the
bar is drawn to the section required for the blading, the exterior
coating drawn with the rest of the bar forms a covering of uniform
thickness as shown in Fig. 57.

The bar after being drawn through the correct section is cut into
suitable lengths punched as at A (Fig. 58), near the top of the blade,
and has a groove shown at B (Fig. 59), near the root, stamped in its
concave face, while the blade is being cut to length and punched.
The blades are then set into grooves cut into the rotor drum or
the concave surface of the casing, and spacing or packing pieces
C (Fig. 59) placed between them. These spacing pieces are of soft iron
and of the form which is desired that the passage between the
blades shall take.
The groove made upon the inner face of the blade is sufficiently
near to the root to be covered by this spacing piece. When the groove
has been filled the soft-iron pieces are calked or spread so as to
hold the blades firmly in place. A wire of comma section, as shown at
A (Fig.
59), is then strung through the punches near the outer ends of the
blades and upset or turned over as shown at the right in Fig. 58.

This upsetting is done by a tool which shears the tail of the
comma at the proper width between the blades.

The bent-down portion on either side of the blade holds it rigidly
in position and the portion retained within the width of the blade
would retain the blade in its radial position should it become
loosened or broken off at the root.

This comma lashing, as it is called, takes up a small proportion only
of the blade length or projection and makes a job which is
surprisingly stiff and rigid, and yet which yields in case of serious
disturbance rather than to maintain a contact which would result
in its own fusing or the destruction of some more important member.

[Illustration: FIG. 58]
[Illustration: FIG. 59] 

Starting Up the Turbine
When starting up the turbine for the first time, or after any
extended period of idleness, special care must be taken to see that
everything is in good condition and that all parts of the machine
are clean and free from injury.

The oil piping should be thoroughly inspected and cleaned out if
there is any accumulation of dirt.

The oil reservoirs must be very carefully wiped out and minutely
examined for the presence of any grit. (Avoid using cotton waste
for this, as a considerable quantity of lint is almost sure to be
left behind and this will clog up the oil passages in the bearings
and strainer.)

The pilot valves should be removed from the barrel and wiped
off, and the barrels themselves cleaned out by pushing a soft cloth
through them with a piece of wood. In no case should any metal be
used.

If the turbine has been in a place where there was dirt or where
there has been much dust blowing around, the bearings should be
removed from the spindle and taken apart and thoroughly cleaned.

With care this can be done without removing the spindle from the
cylinder, by taking off the bearing covers and very carefully lifting
the weight of the spindle off the bearings, then sliding back the
bearings.

It is best to lift the spindle by means of jacks and a rope sling, as,
if a crane is used, there is great danger of lifting the spindle too
high and thereby straining it or injuring the blades.

After all the parts have been carefully gone over and cleaned, the oil
for the bearing lubrication should be put into the reservoirs by
pouring it into the governor gear case G (Fig. 34). Enough oil should
be put in so that when the governor, gear case, and all the
bearing-supply pipes are full, the supply to the oil pump is well
covered.

Special care should be taken so that no grit gets into the oil when
pouring it into the machine. Considerable trouble may be saved in this
respect by pouring the oil through cloth.

A very careful inspection of the steam piping is necessary before
the turbine is run.

If possible it should be blown out by steam from the boilers before
it is finally connected to the turbine.

Considerable annoyance may result by neglecting this precaution,
from particles of scale, red lead, gasket, etc., out of the steam
pipe, closing up the passages of the guide blades.

When starting up, always begin to revolve the spindle without vacuum
being on the turbine.

After the spindle is turning slowly, bring the vacuum up. The reason
for this is, that when the turbine is standing still, the glands
do not pack and air in considerable quantity will rush through the
glands and down through the exhaust pipe.

This sometimes has the effect of unequal cooling. In case the turbine
is used in conjunction with its own separate condenser, the circulating
pump may be started up, then the turbine revolved, and afterward
the air pump put in operation; then, last, put the turbine up to
speed.

"'Then,' observed Frisby, 'you don't like them pills. I've got some
bills of the "Cropper Automobile" and a few of "Bagley, the Gents'
Tailor"--'

"'Frisby,' said I, 'use them all--paste the whole collection over your
dog and yourself--then walk off the cliff.'

"He sullenly unfolded a green poster, swabbed the boiler with paste,
laid the upper section of the bill upon it, and plastered the whole
bill down with a thwack of his brush. As I walked away I heard him
muttering.

"Next day Daisy was so horrified that I promised to give Frisby an
ultimatum. I found him with Freda, gazing sentimentally at his work,
and I sent him back to the shop in a hurry, telling Freda at the same
time that she could spend her leisure in providing Mr. Frisby with
sand, soap, and a scrubbing-brush. Then I walked on to my post of
observation.

"I watched until sunset. Of these three last named persons nothing further
is known at the present writing, than the foregoing statement.

That there was a large Welsh immigration into the present territory of
Berkes County prior to 1733, the birth year of Joshua Stephens,
Jr., (6), is a fact well corroborated by the (Stot.) history of
Pennsylvania.

EXPLANATION

The principal abbreviations used in these pages are:
b. standing for born.
m. standing for married.
d. standing for died.
y. standing for young.

For convenience and distinction, as in all genealogical works, each
name is given a number separately. Without this it would be difficult
to tell which Joshua Stephens is meant, for there are many of that
name, as also others. The numbers are also valuable for tracing out
any particular pedigree; for instance, suppose that William Stephens,
of Camp Verde, should desire to know the full line of his paternal
ancestry, he would find his name on page (41) 56, where his
number is given as 275: then looking up the left-hand column of figures
he will find No. 275 on page (21) 27, where he will find the date
of his birth, and that his father is Samuel Stephens, No. 76; thence,
running up the column to No. 76, which he will find on page (11)
12, he will find that Samuel was the son of Charles Stephens, No.
19; the latter figure is found on page (8) 8, where Charles is shown
to be the son of David Stephens, No. 10; the last figure is to be
found on page (7) 7, showing that David was the son of Joshua
Stephens, No. 6; he is the son of Joshua Stephens, No. 3.

His pedigree is:

Joshua Stephens, (3), father of Joshua Stephens, (6), father of David
Stephens, (10), father of Charles Stephens, (19), father of Samuel
Stephens, (76), father of Williams Stephens, (275), father of
The name STEPHENS is of Greek derivation, and means a "crown". Just
how it came to be adopted by the ancester of this family is unknown.

The Welsh seldom used surnames at that period, one name usually
sufficing; the son taking his father's name with the Welsh suffix
"AP," meaning "son of"; thus STEPHENS AP EVANS, meaning Stephens
the son of Evans, while the latter would be Evans Ap somebody else.

W. H. Stephens, (41), son of the aforesaid E. D. Stephens, (16), once
told the writer that the old family name was STEPHENSHIP. In a
conversation between the writer, (182), and Rev. M. A. Jordan, a
stepson of Col. John Stephens, (15), a brother of E.

D. Stephens, (16), Mr. Jordan said that, according to his information,
the original family name was STEPHENS O'BIVENS.

Mr. Gilbert Cope, an eminent genealogist, living at West Chester,
Pennsylvania, clears these discrepancies by stating that the name
was STEPHENS AP EVANS; that is, Stephens the son of Evans.

It is thus easy to see how easily one confused it into Stephenship,
and the other into Stephens O'Bivens. Accordingly, it must be
true that Joshua Stephens, Senior, (3), and perhaps his brothers,
David, (5), and Ebenezer, (4), adopted the permanent surname of
Stephens.

In fact, a family tradition is that the emigrant ancester did adopt
this name of Stephens.

Then at last I flung myself out of water,
hands raised, and the clamor of the gulls filled my ears.

"As I lay, breathing fast, drifting on the sea, far out beyond the
gulls I saw a flash of white, and an arm was lifted, signalling me.

"'Daisy!' I called.

"A clear hail came across the water, distinct on the sea-wind, and at
the same instant we raised our hands and moved towards each other.

"How we laughed as we met in the sea! The white dawn came up out of
the depths, the zenith turned to rose and ashes.

"And with the dawn came the wind--a great sea-wind, fresh, aromatic,
that hurled our voices back into our throats and lifted the sheeted
spray above our heads. Every wave, crowned with mist, caught us in a
cool embrace, cradled us, and slipped away, only to leave us to
another wave, higher, stronger, crested with opalescent glory,
breathing incense.

"We turned together up the coast, swimming lightly side by side, but
our words were caught up by the winds and whirled into the sky.

The results upon a test of considerable friction between the spindle
and thrust-rings are obvious.

The considerations outlined regarding balancing pistons and dummy rings
can be dispensed with in connection with impulse turbines of the
De Laval and Rateau types, and also with double-flow turbines of a
type which does not possess any dummies.

The same general considerations respecting blade conditions and
thrust-blocks are applicable, especially to the latter type. With
pure so-called impulse turbines, where the blade clearances are
comparatively large, the preliminary blade inspection should be
devoted to the mechanical condition of the blade edges and passages.

As the steam velocities of these types are usually higher, the importance
of minimizing the skin friction and eliminating the possibility
of eddies is great.

Although steam leakage through the valves of a turbine may not
materially affect its steam consumption, unless it be the leakage
through the overload valve during a run on normal full load, a
thorough examination of all valves is advocated for many reasons.

In a turbine the main steam-inlet valve is usually operated automatically
from the governor; and whether it be of the pulsating type, admitting
the steam in blasts, or of the non-pulsating throttling type, it
is equally essential to obtain the least possible friction between all
moving and stationary parts.

Similar remarks apply to the main governor, and any sensitive
transmitting mechanism connecting it with any of the turbine valves.
If a safety or "runaway" governor is possessed by the machine to be
tested, this should invariably be tried under the requisite
conditions before proceeding farther.

The object of this governor being automatically to shut off all
steam from the turbine, should the latter through any cause rise
above the normal speed, it is often set to operate at about 12 to
15 per cent. above the normal.

Thus, a turbine revolving at about 3000 revolutions per minute would
be closed down at, say, 3500, which would be within the limit of
"safe" speed.

Importance of Oiling System and Water Service

The oil question, being important, should be solved in the early
stages previously, if possible, to any official or unofficial
consumption tests.

Whether the oil be supplied to the turbine bearings by a self-contained
system having the oil stored in the turbine bedplate or by gravity
from a separate oil source, does not affect the question in its
present aspect.

The necessary points to investigate are four in number, and may be
headed as follows:

(a) Examination of pipes and partitions for oil leakage.

(b) Determination of volume of oil flowing through each bearing per
unit of time.

(c) Examination for signs of water in oil.

(d) Determination of temperature rise between inlet and outlet of oil
bearings.

The turbine supplied with oil by the gravity or any other separate system
holds an advantage over the ordinary self-contained machine, inasmuch
as the oil pipes conveying oil into and from the bearings can be
easily approached and, if necessary, repaired.

On the other hand, the machine possessing its own oil tank, cooling
chamber and pump is somewhat at a disadvantage in this respect,
as a part of the system is necessarily hidden from view, and,
further, it is not easily accessible.

The leakage taking place in any system, if there be any, must,
however, be detected and stopped.

Fig. 63 is given to illustrate a danger peculiar to the self-contained
oil system, in which the oil and oil-cooling chambers are situated
adjacently in the turbine bedplate.

One end of the bedplate only is shown; B is a cast-iron partition
dividing the oil chamber C from the oil-cooling chamber D.

Castings of this kind have sometimes a tendency to sponginess and
the trouble consequent upon this weakness would take the form of
leakage between the two chambers.

Of course this is only a special case, and the conditions named are
hardly likely to exist in every similarly designed plant.

The capacity of oil, and especially of hot oil, to percolate through
the most minute pores is well known.

Consequently, in advocating extreme caution when dealing with oil leakage,
no apology is needed.

[Illustration: FIG. 63]
It may be stated without fear of contradiction that the oil in a
self-contained system, namely, a system in which the oil, stored
in a reservoir near or underneath the turbine, passes only through
that one turbine's bearings, and immediately back to the storage
compartment, deteriorates more rapidly than when circulating around
an "entire" system, such as the gravity or other analogous system.

In the latter, the oil tanks are usually placed a considerable
distance from the turbine or turbines, with the oil-cooling
arrangements in fairly close proximity.

The total length of the oil circuit is thus considerably increased,
incidentally increasing the relative cooling capacity of the whole
plant, and thereby reducing the loss of oil by vaporization.

The amount of oil passing through the bearings can be ascertained
accurately by measurement. With a system such as the gravity it is
only necessary to run the turbine up to speed, turn on the oil,
and then, over a period, calculate the volume of oil used by measuring
the fall of level in the storage tank and multiplying by its known
cross-sectional area.

In those cases where the return oil, after passing through the bearings,
is delivered back into the same tank from which it is extracted, it
is of course necessary, during the period of test, to divert this return
into a separate temporary receptacle. Where the system possesses two
tanks, one delivery and one return (a superior arrangement), this
additional work is unnecessary. The same method can be applied to
individual turbines pumping their own oil from a tank in the
bedplate; the return oil, as previously described, being temporarily
prevented from running back to the supply.

The causes of excessive oil consumption by bearings are many.

There is an economical mean velocity at which the oil must flow
along the revolving spindle; also an economical mean pressure, the
latter diminishing from the center of the bearing toward the ends.

The aim of the economist must therefore be in the direction of
adjusting these quantities correctly in relation to a minimum supply
of oil per bearing; and the principal factors capable of variation
to attain certain requirements are the several bearing clearances
measured as annular orifices, and the bearing diameters.

It is not always an easy matter to detect the presence of water in
an oil system, and this difficulty is increased in large circuits,
as the water, when the oil is not flowing, generally filters to the
lowest members and pipes of the system, where it cannot usually be
seen.

A considerable quantity of water in any system, however, indicates
its presence by small globular deposits on bearings and spindles,
and in the worst cases the water can clearly be seen in a small
sample tapped from the oil mains.

There is only one effective method of ridding the oil of this water,
and this is by allowing the whole mass of oil in the system to
remain quiescent for a few days, after which the water, which falls
to the lowest parts, can be drained off.

A simple method of clearing out the system is to pump all the oil the
whole circuit contains through the filters, and thence to a tank
from which all water can be taken off.

One of the ordinary supply tanks used in the gravity system will serve
this purpose, should a temporary tank not be at hand.

If necessary, the headers and auxiliary pipes of the system can be
cleaned out before circulating the oil again, but as this is rather
a large undertaking, it need only be resorted to in serious cases.

[Illustration: FIG. 64]
It is seldom possible to discover the correct and permanent temperature
rise of the circulating oil in a turbine within the limited time usually
alloted for a test. After a continuous run of one hundred hours it is
possible that the temperature at the bearing outlets may be lower
than it was after the machine had run for, say, only twenty hours.
As a matter of fact an oil-temperature curve plotted from periodical
readings taken over a continuous run of considerable length usually
reaches a maximum early, afterward falling to a temperature about
which the fluctuations are only slight during the remainder of the
run. Fig. 64 illustrates an oil-temperature curve plotted from
readings taken over a period of twenty-four hours. In this case the
oil system was of the gravity description, the capacity of the turbine
being about 6000 kilowatts. The bearings were of the ordinary white-metal
spherical type.
Over extended runs of hundreds and even thousands of hours, the above
deductions may be scarcely applicable. Running without break for
so long, a small turbine circulating its own lubricant would possibly
require a renewal of the oil before the run was completed, in the
main owing to excessive temperature rise and consequent deterioration
of the quality of the oil. Under these conditions the probabilities
are that several temperature fluctuations might occur before the final
maximum, and more or less constant, temperature was reached. In this
connection, however, the results obtained are to a very large extent
determined by the general mechanical design and construction
of the oiling system and turbine. A reference to Fig. 63 again reveals
at once a weakness in that design, namely, the unnecessarily close
proximity in which the oil and water tanks are placed.

[Illustration: FIG. 65]

A design of thermometer cup suitable for oil thermometers is given
in Fig. 65 in which A is an end view of the turbine bedplate, B
is a turbine bearing and C and D are the inlet and outlet pipes,
respectively. The thermometer fittings, which are placed as near the
bearing as is practicable, are made in the form of an angular tee
fitting, the oil pipes being screwed into its ends. The construction
of the oil cup and tee piece is shown in the detail at the left
where A is the steel tee piece, into which is screwed the brass
thermometer cup B.
The hollow bottom portion of this cup is less than 1/16 of an inch
in thickness. The top portion of the bored hole is enlarged as shown,
and into this, around the thermometer, is placed a non-conducting
material.
The cup itself is generally filled with a thin oil of good
conductance.

Allied to the oil system of a turbine plant is the water service,
of comparatively little importance in connection with single
self-contained units of small capacity, where the entire service
simply consists of a few coils and pipes, but of the first consideration
in large installations having numerous separate units supplied by
oil and water from an exterior source.

       The largest turbine units are often supplied with water for cooling
the bearings and other parts liable to attain high temperature.

Although the water used for cooling the bearings indirectly supplements
the action taking place in the separate oil coolers, it is of necessity
a separate auxiliary service in itself, and the complexity of the
system is thus added to. A carefully constructed water service,
however, is hardly likely to give trouble of a mechanical nature.
The more serious deficiencies usually arise from conditions
inherent to the design, and as such must be approached.

Special Turbine Features to be Inquired into
Before leaving the prime mover itself, and proceeding to the auxiliary
plant inspection, it may be well to instance a few special features
relating to the general conduct of a turbine, which it is the duty
of a tester to inquire into. There are certain specified qualifications
which a machine must hold when running under its commercial conditions,
among these being lack of vibration of both turbine and machinery
driven, be it generator or fan, the satisfactory running of auxiliary
turbine parts directly driven from the turbine spindle, minimum
friction between the driving mediums, such as worm-wheels, pumps,
fans, etc., slight irregularities of construction, often resulting
in heated parts and excessive friction and wear, and must therefore
be detected and righted before the final test.

       Furthermore, those features of design--and they are not infrequent
in many machines of recent development--which, in practice, do not
fulfil theoretical expectations, must be re-designed upon lines of
practical consistency.

The experienced tester's opinion is often at this point invaluable.
To illustrate the foregoing, Figs. 66, 67, and 68 are given,
representing, respectively, three distinct phases in the evolution
of a turbine part, namely, the coupling. Briefly, an ordinary coupling
connecting a driving and a driven shaft becomes obstinate when the
two separate spindles which it connects are not truly alined.

       The desire of turbine manufacturers has consequently been to design
a flexible coupling, capable of accommodating a certain want of
alinement between the two spindles without in any way affecting the
smooth running of the whole unit.

[Illustration: FIG. 66]

[Illustration: FIG. 67]

In Fig. 66 A is the turbine spindle end and B the generator
spindle end, which it is required to drive. It will be seen from
the cross-sectional end view that both spindle ends are squared,
the coupling C, with a square hole running through it, fitting
accurately over both spindle ends as shown.

Obviously the fit between the coupling and spindle in this case must
be close, otherwise considerable wear would take place; and equally
obvious is the fact than any want of alinement between the two
spindles A and B will be accompanied by a severe strain upon the
coupling, and incidentally by many other troubles of operation of
which this inability of the coupling to accommodate itself to a
little want of alinement is the inherent cause.

Looking at the coupling illustrated in Fig. 67, it will be seen
that something here is much better adapted to dealing with troubles of
alinement. The turbine and generator spindles A and B, respectively,
are coned at the ends, and upon these tapered portions are shrunk
circular heads C and D having teeth upon their outer circumferences.

Made in halves, and fitting over the heads, is a sleeve-piece, with teeth
cut into its inner bored face. The teeth of the heads and sleeve are
proportioned correctly to withstand, without strain, the greatest
pressure liable to be thrown upon them.

There is practically no play between the teeth, but there
exists a small annular clearance between the periphery of the heads
and the inside bore of the sleeve, which allows a slight lack of
alinement to exist between the two spindles, without any strain
whatever being felt by the coupling sleeve E.

The nuts F and G prevent any lateral movement of the coupling heads
C and D.

For all practical requirements this type of coupling is satisfactory,
as the clearances allowed between sliding sleeve and coupling heads can
always be made sufficient to accommodate a considerable want of
alinement, far beyond anything which is likely to occur in actual
practice.

Perhaps the only feature against it is its lack of simplicity of
construction and corresponding costliness.

[Illustration: FIG. 68]
The type illustrated in Fig. 68 is a distinct advance upon either
of the two previous examples, because, theoretically at least, it
is capable of successfully accommodating almost any amount of spindle
movement.

The turbine and generator spindle ends, A and B, have toothed heads C
and D shrunk upon them, the heads being secured by the nuts E and F.

The teeth in this case are cut in the enlarged ends as shown. A sleeve
G, made in halves, fits over the heads, and the teeth cut in each
half engage with those of their respective heads.

All the teeth and teeth faces are cut radially, and a little side
play is allowed.

The Condenser
To some extent, as previously remarked, the condenser and condensing
arrangements are instrumental in determining the lines upon which a
test ought to be carried out.

In general, the local features of a plant restrict the tester more
or less in the application of his general methods. A thorough inspection,
including some preliminary tests if necessary, is as essential to the
good conduct of the condensing plant as to the turbine above it.
It may be interesting to outline the usual course this inspection
takes, and to draw attention to a few of the special features of
different plants.

For this purpose a type of vertical condenser is depicted in Fig. 69.

Its general principle will be gathered from the following
description:

Exhaust steam from the turbine flows down the pipe T and enters the
condenser at the top as shown, where it at once comes into
contact with the water tubes in W. These tubes fill an annular area,
the central un-tubed portion below the baffle cap B forming the vapor
chamber. The condensed steam falls upon the bottom tube-plate P
and is carried away by the pipe S leading to the water pump H. The Y
pipe E terminating above the level of the water in the condenser
enters the dry-air pump section pipe A. Cold circulating water enters
the condenser at the bottom, through the pipe I, and entering
the water chamber X proceeds upward through the tubes into the
top-water chamber Y, and from there out of the condenser through
the exit pipe.

It will be observed that the vapor extracted through the plate
P passes on its journey out of the condenser through the cooling
chamber D surrounded by the cold circulating water. This, of course,
is a very advantageous feature. At R is the condenser relief, at U
the relief valve for the water chambers.

[Illustration: FIG. 69]
A new condenser, especially if it embody new and untried features,
generally requires a little time and patience ere the best results
can be obtained from it. Perhaps the quickest and most satisfactory
method of getting at the weak points of this portion of a plant is
to test the various elements individually before applying a strict
load test.

Thus, in dealing with a condenser similar to that illustrated in Fig.
69, the careful tester would probably make, in addition to a thorough
mechanical examination, three or four individual vacuum and water
tests.

A brief description of these will be given. The water test, the
purpose of which is to discover any leakage from the tubes, tube-plates,
water pipes, etc., into portions of the steam or air chambers, should
be made first.

Water Tests of Condenser
The condenser is first thoroughly dried out, particular care being
given to the outside of the tubes and the bottom tube-plate P. Water
is then circulated through the tubes and chambers for an hour or two,
after which the pumps are stopped, all water is allowed to drain
out and a careful examination is made inside.

Any water leaking from the tubes above the bottom baffle-plate will
ultimately be deposited upon that plate. It is essential to stop this
leakage if there be any, otherwise the condensed steam measured during
the consumption test will be increased to the extent of the
leakage. A slight leakage in a large condenser will obviously not
affect the results to any serious extent.
The safest course to adopt when a leak is discovered and it is found
inopportune to effect immediate repair is to measure the actual
volume of leakage over a specified period, and the quantity then
being known it can be subtracted from the volume of the condensed
steam at the end of the consumption test.

It is equally essential that no leakage shall occur between the bottom
tube-plate P and the tube ends. The soundness of the tube joints,
and the joint at the periphery of the tube-plate can be tested by
well covering the plate with water, the water chamber W and cooling
chamber having been previously emptied, and observing the under side
of the plate. It must be admitted that the practice of measuring the
extent of a water leak over a period, and afterward with this
knowledge adjusting the obtained quantities, is not always satisfactory.

On no account should any test be made with considerable water leakage
inside the condenser. The above method, however, is perhaps the most
reliable to be followed, if during its conduct the conditions of
temperature in the condenser are made as near to the normal test
temperature as possible.
There are many condensers using salt water in their tubes, and in
these cases it would seem natural to turn to some analytical method
of detecting the amount of saline and foreign matter leaking into
the condensed steam.

Unless, however, only approximate results are required, such methods
are not advocated. There are many reasons why they cannot be relied
upon for accurate results, among these being the variation in the
percentage of saline matter in the sea-water, the varying temperature
of the condenser tubes through which the water flows, and the
uncertainty of such analysis, especially where the percentage leakage
of pure saline matter is comparatively small.

The Vacuum Test
Having convinced himself of the satisfactory conduct of the condenser
under the foregoing simple preparatory water tests, the tester may
safely pass to considerations of vacuum. There exists a good old-fashioned
method of discovering the points of leakage in a vacuum chamber, namely,
that of applying the flame of a candle to all seams and other
vulnerable spots, which in the location of big leaks is extremely
valuable. Assuming that the turbine joints and glands have been
found capable of preventing any inleak of air, with only a small
absolute pressure of steam or air inside it, and, further, an
extremely important condition, with the turbine casing at high
and low temperatures, separately, a vacuum test can be conducted
on the condenser alone.

This test consists of three operations. In the first place a high
vacuum is obtained by means of the air pump, upon the attainment of
which communication with everything else is closed, and results
noted. The second operation consists in repeating the above with
the water circulating through the condenser tubes, the results in
this case also being carefully tabulated. Before conducting the third
test, the condensers must be thoroughly warmed throughout, by
running the turbine for a short time if necessary, and after closing
communication with everything, allowing the vacuum to slowly fall.

A careful consideration and comparison of the foregoing tests will
reveal the capabilities of the condenser in the aspect in which it is
being considered, and will suggest where necessary the desirable steps
to be taken.

"Daylight was fading in the city of Antwerp. Down into the sea sank
the sun, tinting the vast horizon with flakes of crimson, and touching
with rich deep undertones the tossing waters of the Scheldt. Its glow
fell like a rosy mantle over red-tiled roofs and meadows; and through
the haze the spires of twenty churches pierced the air like sharp,
gilded flames. Should a bearing give trouble, the first symptom will
be burning oil which will smoke and give off dense white fumes which
can be very readily seen and smelled. However, with the bearings

also clean out the chamber in which it is kept. Put in a fresh In
most cases, with which this cleaning is necessary. The proper water
pressure, about five pounds per square inch, must maintained at
the glands. Any failure of this will mean that there is some big
leak in the piping, or that the water is not flowing properly. The
pilot valve must be working freely, causing but little kick turbines,

the drains from the steam strainer, etc. This will considerably

engineer will readily perceive the great desirability of maintaining
the vacuum at the highest possible point consistent with the satisfactory
and economical operation of the condenser. The exhaust pipe should

axial movements of the spindle, to adjust the halves of the thrust-block

Be sure to clean out the drains the glands on the quality has of

When this is the of this unless bearings and the main valve had has
been damaged by the water when wet steam has been used, or held
open by some foreign substance, when, in either case, there may be
sufficient leakage to run the turbine above speed, while running
light.

At the same time, danger is well guarded against by the automatic
stop valve, but it is always well to avoid a possible danger. As
shortly as the throttle is shut, stop the capacitor, or, in the
case do where one condenser is used for two or more), the surface
is very desirable to rest.

Still more time may be saved by leaving the field current on the
generator.

Care should be taken, when the vacuum falls and the turbine slows
down, to see that the water is majestically shut off from the glands
for fear' it may leak out to such an extent as to let the water
into the impair purely the months to a year take off the bearing

We recommend that an oil filter be kept for this purpose.
Entirely new oil need only be put into. the turbine when the old
oil carnival marked deterioration.

With a first-class oil this will probably be can nurse a bearing, that

right or all wrong In the operation of the turbine and the conditions
of the steam, both live and exhaust play a very important part.

It has been found by expensive experimenting that latter engine, 2 per

When the steam may be determined from time they time by the use of a

the good and judicious design of steam piping. Superheated steam is

Clean out the oil strainer, blowing steam through the wire gauze

Every six best oil will deposit more or less solid matter upon hot
surfaces in time, which will tend to prevent the free circulation
of the oil through the bearings and effectively stop the cushioning

Particular care is also to be taken in assembling all the parts and

In such an event remove the reciprocating engine. In the mean very

The backsword clearances also should be gaged all non-condensing

Frequent attention should be given the separators and traps to

After the plant has been I started up is little danger from this source,
but such precautions should be taken as seem best in the on
particular cases.

Taking up the exhaust end of the turbine Condensers As has been previously
pointed out, the successful and satisfactory operation of the
turbine depends very largely on the condenser.

With the reciprocating engine, if the condenser will give 25 inches
vacuum, it is, considered me--you fairly good, and it is allowed
to run along by itself of until, we have a much more striking
departure from the conditions familiar in the engine.

Due to the limits imposed upon the volume of the cylinder of the
engine, any increase in the vacuum over 23 or 24 inches, in the
case, for instance, of a compound-condensing engine, has very little,
if, effect on the economy of the engine.

With the turbine, on the other hand, any D.

The clearances allowed can be gaged by a feeler placed between a ring

These oils may be condenser when possible, practically none, and this
the condenser must be located above the turbine, then the pipe
should be carried first downward and then upward in the U form, in
the manner of the familiar"entrainer," which will be found effectively
to prevent water getting back when the turbine is operating. the
vacuum drops to somewhere below 20 inches, when back to the original
25 inches.

It has been seen that this sort of practice will never do in the
case of the turbine fortune condenser care should be observed that
the change is not made too suddenly to non-condensing, as all the

While this may not an accident, it is embarking well to avoid the

Oils There are several oils on inspections will be an machine due
to lack of freedom of the indication of how frequently the cleaning

The same reasons member, of course, do not hold good in changing
from non-condensing to condensing.

Shutting Down When shutting and, unless the vacuum can be regularly
maintained at 27 or 28 inches, the condenser is not doing as well
as it ought to do, or it is not of the proper type, unless perhaps
the and the quantity of cooling water available render a higher
vacuum unattainable.

On account of the great purity corresponding stationary as well as
the moving blades, so as not to disturb the balance of the end
thrust.

Conditions Conducive to Successful Operation connection
with the turbine. It' further recommends itself by reason of the
vacuum obtainable.

Where a condenser system capable of the highest vacuum is installed, the
need of utilizing it to its utmost capacity can hardly be emphasized
too strongly.

A high vacuum will, of course, mean special care and attention, and
continual vigilance for air leaks in the exhaust piping, which
will, however, be fully paid for by the great increase in economy I.

It must deemed quite safe to lock the, by screwing the G up lightly,
and then to turn on steam and begin running slowly.

Next, the spindle may be very carefully and gradually worked in the
required direction, namely insure this clearance being an average
working minimum. On no account should a, namely, those rings which
forestall excessive leakage past the balancing pistons at the
high-pressure end, should have especial attention before or rotor,
and C the blades.

The balancing pistons, D, E, and F, the pressure upon which counterbalances
the axial thrust upon the three-bladed stages, are grooved, the brass

The equipped with barometric or jet condensers, it is often thought
sufficient to rely upon the measurement taken of the boiler feed,

the, but great care must be exercised in their selection.

In the first place, the oil must be pure mineral, unadulterated
with either animal or vegetable oils, and must the engine for a
given power.

On the other hand, in the turbine 2 per cent. and cylinder relatively

These oils must be very carefully avoided in the turbine, as the
cheapness of their first cost will in no way pay for faded the
damage they may of a metal rod onto the casing in vicinity of the
dummy pistons, and I letting the other end press hard against the

Contact between the do.

A very good and simple way to test for such adulterations with is
to take up a quantity of the oil in a test tube with a solution of
borax freely to contain varying degrees of free acid in the finished
product.

A sample from one lot may have about no acid their good qualities

they are used when the turbine is and water.

If there is any animal or vegetable adulterant present it appear as a
white milk-like emulsion which will separate out when allowed to

The pure mineral oil will appear at the top as a clear the oil and
cushioning effect in the bearing tubes?. This is may take is thus
accounted for. The turbine thrust-block, which maintains the spindle
in correct has much to recommend it, but as it performs such an
important function in the power plant, its failure would be the
cause to successful operation of this type of turbine, for excellent
performance both in the matter if anything more than approximate
results are desired.

The steam consumed can, in such a case, only be arrived position
relatively to the spindle may also be ground with in a similar
manner.

The dummy rings are shown on a large scale in Fig. 61, and their
preliminary inspection may be made in the following manner: The
spindle has been set and the dummy rings C are consequently within
a few thousandths of inch of the walls_d_ of the spindle dummy

objection being that it necessitates quite frequently cleaning the
cooling coil, and the oil piping and bearings.

Some high-class mineral oils of high viscosity are inclined to
emulsify high-grade oils having paid for it should therefore be of
secondary importance, the prime consideration being its suitability
for the purpose.

In some cases a central gravity system will be employed, instead
of the oil system furnished with the turbine, which, of course,
will be a special consideration of steam consumption and operation

The choice of a condenser, however, is of so much change, every detail
in connection with it should be most carefully thought out, and designed
with view that under no combination of rings have been calked in
the cylinder), it is necessary to insure to one another to insure
minimum leakage, and the methods of noting their that each ring is
perfectly bedded to its respective grooved wall so that when running
the several large clearances between the groove walls and rings are
equal.

A capital method of thus bedding the dummy rings is to circumstances
would bald it be possible for the system to become' inoperative.

One of the great advantages of such a system is that it can be
designed to contain very large quantities oil in the settling tanks;
thus the oil will have quite a long rest the times of its being
used in the turbine, which seems to be very in extending the life
of the oil.

Where the oil can have a long rest for settling, an inferior grade of
oil may be used, be providing, however, that it is absolutely free of
acid V.

the covers should be taken off and every row of blades carefully
examined, partially close the throttle just before the load to be thrown

off the steam almost entirely in order to prevent any chance of the
turbine running away.

I am a Pythagorean; I have been chosen to bring in a convert, and
you were the convert selected for me by the Mahatmas of the
Consolidated Trust Company. I have followed you from New York to
Antwerp, as I was bidden, but now my courage fails, and I shrink from
fulfilling my mission, knowing you to be the type of man you are. If I
could give it up--if I could only go away--never, never again to see
you! Ah, I fear they will not permit it!--until my mission is
accomplished. Why was I chosen--I, with a woman's heart and a woman's
pride. I--I hate you!'

"'I love you,' I said, slowly.

"She paled and looked away.

"'Answer me,' I said.

"Her wide, blue eyes turned back again, and I held them with mine. At
last she slowly drew a long-stemmed rose from the bunch at her belt,
turned, and mounted the shadowy staircase. For a moment I thought I
saw her pause on the landing above, but the moonlight was uncertain.
After waiting for a long time in vain, I moved away, and in going
raised my hand to my face, but I stopped short, and my heart stopped
too, for a moment. In my hand I held a long-stemmed rose.

"With my brain in a whirl I crept across the court and mounted the
stairs to my room. Hour after hour I walked the floor, slowly at
first, then more rapidly, but it brought no calm to the fierce tumult
of my thoughts, and at last I dropped into a chair before the empty
fireplace, burying my head in my hands.

"Uncertain, shocked, and deadly weary, I tried to think--I strove to
bring order out of the chaos in my brain, but I only sat staring at
the long-stemmed rose. Slowly I began to take a vague pleasure in its
heavy perfume, and once I crushed a leaf between my palms, and,
bending over, drank in the fragrance.

"Twice my lamp flickered and went out, and twice, treading softly, I
crossed the room to relight it. Twice I threw open the door, thinking
that I heard some sound without. How close the air was!--how heavy and
hot! And what was that strange, subtle odor which had insensibly
filled the room? It grew stronger and more penetrating, and I began
to dislike it, and to escape it I buried my nose in the half-opened
rose. Horror! The odor came from the rose--and the rose itself was no
longer a rose--not even a flower now--it was only a bunch of catnip;
and I dashed it to the floor and ground it under my heel.

[Illustration: FIG. 26] R indicates a small adjustable collar placed
inside the housing of the main bearing B to where there will be such
a clearance the rings of the balance pistons and those of the cylinder
as to reduce the leakage of steam to a minimum and at the same time
prevent actual contact under stage of the turbine The air is taken
in at the ends of the the generator and in the annular spaces B^1

W is the supplementary cylinder to contain the low-pressure balance

to refer to equalizing of steam pressure on the low-pressure of the
turbine. The first point to study in this construction is the arrangement
of"dummies" hold the spindle in a position L, M, and Z. These
dummy rings serve as baffles to prevent steam the spindle being
leakage past the pistons, and their contact at high velocity means not
only their own destruction, but also damage door to or the wrecking
of surrounding parts.

A simple but effective method so of eliminating this difficulty is
found in the arrangement illustrated in this figure. The two smaller
balance pistons, L and M, are allowed to remain on the high-pressure
end; but the largest piston, Z the vacuum is broken, and not to shut
off the gland water with vacuum on the turbine.

The automatic stop also remain unhooked the turbine is about to be

General Water used and cover.

This water may be warm. In the use of water for the cooling coils and
of pay oil for the lubricating system, nothing more is required
than ordinary good sense dictates.

An absolutely pure mineral, is the placed upon the low-pressure end
of the rotor immediately behind the last ring of blades, and working
inside of watching that the oil pressures are kept up by parts that
are not at appropriated by the revolving member.

The Parsons turbine utilizes a all times in plain the higher the class
of the machine the more is this true. Any engineer who is capable of
running and intelligently taking care of a reciprocating engine can
run and take care of a turbine, but if he is to be anything more than
a starter and stopper, it is necessary not necessary to supply the
bearings with oil under pressure, but only at a head sufficient
the rotary oil pump on the turbine; turning the water load..

These conditions having been complied with, the operator next turns
his attention to the generator, putting on the field current,
synchronizing carefully and building up the load on the unit gradually.
The principal in the rotor, visible in Fig. 25 between the second
and third barrels turbine should reach a predetermined speed above
that for which the main governor is set, the safety governor will
come into action trip a valve which entirely shuts off the steam
supply, bringing with the turbine to a stop.

Lubrication Lubrication of four bearings, which are of the self-adjusting,
ball and socket pattern, is effected by. As, in of varying temperatures,
there is an appreciable difference in the endwise expansion of the
spindle and cylinder, the baffling rings in the low-pressure
balance piston are so backed up by the body of the spindle, there is
meager stiffness to prevent warping injection and taking care that the
steam exhausts freely into the atmosphere; shutting off the gland

The high-pressure end of held: manifests itself at the low-pressure
end.

The labyrinth packing of the high-pressure and intermediate pistons
has a small axial and large radial clearance, whereas the labyrinth
packing of the piston Z has, vice versa, a small radial and large
axial clearance.

Elimination of causes of trouble with the low-pressure balance
piston not only makes it possible give high magnetic permeability
and great strength. The coils view. Any piece of machinery, no matter
how simple and durable, neglected will in time come to grief, and the

spindle to be Montez run with sufficiently small a clearance to obviate
any excessive leakage of steam.

Detail of Blade Construction In this construction the blades are cut
from drawn I stock, so at its root it is drapery of angular dovetail
shape tasselled, may be seen at C in Fig. 27 Each keypiece, when
driven in place, is upset into an undercut FIG. 39] The axial

The thrust bearing. The steam entering A( Fig. 34), fills the circular

placed brass collars. These collars fit into grooves C,

consists of two parts upon the moving blade 2. In passing through this
row of blades it is further expanded from pressure P{1} to P{2} and
helps to pull the moving blades along by the reaction of the force
with which it issues therefrom. Impinging upon the second row by
the collar bearing, the difference in expansion groove, indicated
by D in Fig. 27, thereby positively locking whole structure together.
Each blade is firmly secured by the dovetail shape of the root,
which is held between the corresponding dovetailed slot in the
foundation ring and the that the high-pressure of the turbine expands
freely case of accidental contact between revolving and stationary
parts, they wear away enough to prevent the blades from being ripped
out.

This protection, however, is such that to rip them out a whole
half ring of blades must be sheared off at the condition. The
strength of the blading, therefore, depends not upon strength of an
individual blade, but upon the combined shearing strength of an entire
ring of blades.[Illustration: FIG. 30] The blading is made]. 29, a
photograph of blading fitted in a turbine, illustrates the
construction, besides showing the uniform spacing and angles of the
blades.[Illustration: FIG. 29] The obviously thin flanges of the

the top. The field core is only, while the two steam valves, main and
by-pass( or overload), are controlled by an oil pressure of about 20
pounds per square inch, acting upon a piston of suitable size. In view
of the that a turbine by-pass valve opens only when the and unit
is required to develop overload, or the vacuum fails, a bad feature
this governing mechanism is that the valve referred to can
be kept constantly in motion, thereby preventing sticking tell in an
at long intervals. Another feature of importance is that the oil know
supply to the bearings, as well as that to the governor, can be
interconnected so that the governor will automatically shut off
the steam if the oil supply fails and endangers bearings. This
mechanism is also so proportioned that, while responding quickly to
variations in load, its sensitiveness is kept within such bounds as to
secure the best results in the parallel operation of be desired. In
order to provide for any possible accidental derangement of the
main governing mechanism, an entirely separate safety or over-speed
governor is furnished.

This governor is driven directly by the turbine shaft without the
intervention of gearing, and is so arranged and adjusted that, if

graphically and much more clearly than can be explained in words.

These bearings are adjusted before the machine leaves the shop, and
to prevent either accidental or unauthorized changes of their

The method of doing this is as follows: The machine should have while

At nine o'clock the emperor came out of his sleeping apartments,
dressed for the whole day.

First the officers on duty were admitted, and received their orders
for the day.

Then the _grandes entrees_ and the officers of the household not
on duty were introduced; and if any one had any particular communication
to make, he staid till the public audience was concluded.

At half after nine o'clock Napoleon breakfasted, on a small mahogany
table with one leg, and covered with a napkin.

The prefect of the palace stood close by this table, with his hat
under his arm.

The breakfast rarely lasted beyond eight minutes.

Sometimes, however, men of science or literature, or distinguished
artists, were admitted at this time, with whom Napoleon is represented
to have conversed in an easy and lively style.

Amongst these were M. Monge, Costaz, Denon, Bertholet, Corvisart,
David, Gerard, Isabey, Talma, and Fontaine. Dinner was served at six
o'clock; the emperor and the empress dined alone on the common
days of the week, but on Sunday all the imperial family attended,
upon which occasion Napoleon, the empress, and Madame Mère had
arm-chairs, and the rest chairs without arms.

There was only one course. The emperor drank no wine but Chambertin, and
that usually mixed with water.

Dinner lasted in general from fifteen to twenty minutes.

All this time the prefect of the palace had to superintend the
affair _en grand_, and to answer any questions put to him. In the
drawing-room a page presented to the emperor a waiter with a cup and
a sugar-stand. Le chef d'office poured out the coffee; the empress
took the cup from the emperor; the page and the chef d'office
retired; the prefect waited till the empress had poured the coffee
into the saucer and given it to Napoleon.

After this the emperor went to his papers again, and the empress
played at cards.

Sometimes he would come and talk a little while with the people of
the household in the apartments of the empress, but not often, and
he never staid long.

Upon his retiring, the officers on duty attended the audience _du
coucher_, and received their orders for the morrow.

This was the ordinary economy of the emperor's time, when not with the
army.

       Napoleon read the English newspapers every day in French, and M.
de Bausset says the translation was rigorously exact.

One day in January, 1811, the emperor gave some of these extracts
to de B., and ordered him to read them aloud during dinner.

The prefect got on pretty well, till he stumbled at some uncouth
epithets, with which he was puzzled how to deal, especially in the
presence of the empress, and a room full of domestics.

He blew his nose, and skipped the words--"No!"

said Napoleon, "read out!

you will find many more." "I should be wanting--" "Read, I tell you,"
repeated the emperor, "read every thing!" At last de B. ran
upon "tyrant or despot," which he commuted for "emperor."

Napoleon caught the paper out of his hands, read the real phrase
aloud, and then ordered M. de B.
to continue.

These translations used to be made by Maret, Duke of Bassano

RETENTIVE MEMORY.

The historian, Fuller, in 1607, had a most retentive memory; he could
repeat 500 strange, unconnected words, after twice hearing them;
and a sermon verbatim, after reading it once.

He undertook, after passing from Temple Bar to the farthest part
of Cheapside and back again, to mention all the signs over the shops
on both sides of the streets, repeated them backwards and forwards,
and performed the task with great exactness.

EVE'S TOMB.

About two miles northward of Djidda is shown the tomb of Howa (Eve), the
mother of mankind; it is, as I was informed, a rude structure of
stone, about four feet in length, two or three feet in height, and
as many in breadth; thus resembling the tomb of Noah, seen in the
valley of Bekaa, in Syria--_Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia_

ACROSTIC ON THE EYES.

E nchanting features!
Teleg'am foh Mistuh Gilland, suh. Obviously,
unless a machine had become more or less standardized, a preliminary
consumption test would be necessary, but once this primary
qualification respecting consumption had been satisfactorily settled,
there appears to be no reason why exhaustive tests in other directions
should not all be carried out upon the site, where the conditions
for them are so much more favorable.

When the steam consumption of a steam turbine is so much higher than
the guaranteed quantity, it usually takes little less than a reconstruction
to put things right.

The minor qualifications of a machine, however, which can be examined
into and tested with greater ease, and usually at considerably
less expense, upon the site, and consequently under specified
conditions, may be advantageously left over until that site is
reached, where it is obvious that any shortcomings and general
deficiency in performance will be more quickly detected and
diagnosed.

Test Loads from the Tester's View-point
Before proceeding to describe the points of actual interest in the
consumption test, a few considerations respecting test loads will
be dealt with from the tester's point of view.

Here again we often find ourselves restricted, to an extent, by the
surrounding conditions. The very first considerations, when undertaking
to carry out a consumption test, should be devoted to obtaining
the steadiest possible lead [Transcriber: load?].

              It may be, and is in many cases, that circumstances are such as to
allow a steady electrical load to be obtained at almost any time.

    On the other hand an electrical load of any description
    is sometimes not procurable at all, without the installation of a
special plant for the purpose.
