CHAPTER I. "What Kind of Shoes Are the Shoes You Wear?"

"What makes you wear such funny shoes?"

Linda Strong thrust forward a foot and critically examined the narrow
vamp, the projecting sole, the broad, low heel of her well-worn brown
calfskin shoe. Then her glance lifted to the face of Donald Whiting, one
of the most brilliant and popular seniors of the high school. Her eyes
narrowed in a manner habitual to her when thinking intently.

"Never you mind my shoes," she said deliberately. "Kindly fix your
attention on my head piece. When you see me allowing any Jap in my class
to make higher grades than I do, then I give you leave to say anything
you please concerning my head."

An angry red rushed to the boy's face. It was an irritating fact that in
the senior class of that particular Los Angeles high school a Japanese
boy stood at the head. This was embarrassing to every senior.

"I say," said Donald Whiting, "I call that a mean thrust."

"I have a particular reason," said Linda.

"And I have 'a particular reason'," said Donald, "for being interested
in your shoes."

Linda laughed suddenly. When Linda laughed, which was very seldom, those
within hearing turned to look at her. Hers was not a laugh that can be
achieved. There were a few high places on the peak of Linda's soul, and
on one of them homed a small flock of notes of rapture; notes as sweet
as the voice of the white-banded mockingbird of Argentina.

"How surprising!" exclaimed Linda. "We have been attending the same
school for three years; now, you stop me suddenly to tell me that you
are interested in the shape of my shoes."

"I have been watching them all the time," said Donald. "Can't understand
why any girl wants to be so different. Why don't you dress your hair the
same as the other girls and wear the same kind of clothes and shoes?"

"Now look here," interposed Linda "You are flying the track.I am willing
to justify my shoes, if I can, but here you go including my dress and a
big psychological problem, as well; but I think perhaps the why of the
shoes will explain the remainder. Does the name 'Alexander Strong' mean
anything to you?"

"The great nerve specialist?" asked Donald.

"Yes," said Linda. "The man who was the author of half-dozen books
that have been translated into many foreign tongue' and are used as
authorities all over the world. He happened to be my father There are
two children in our family. I have a sister four years older than I am
who is exactly like Mother, and she and Mother were inseparable. I am
exactly like Father; because we understood each other, and because both
of us always new, although we never mentioned it; that Mother preferred
my sister Eileen to me, Father tried to make it up to me, so from the
time I can remember I was at his heels. It never bothered him to have me
playing around in the library while he was writing his most complicated
treatise. I have waited in his car half a day at a time, playing or
reading, while he watched a patient or delivered a lecture at some
medical college. His mental relaxation was to hike or to motor to the
sea, to the mountains, to the canyons or the desert, and he very seldom
went without me even on long trips when he was fishing or hunting with
other men. There was not much to know concerning a woman's frame or he
psychology that Father did not know, so there were two reason why he
selected my footwear as he did. THE WORLD'S" BEST POETRY[Illustration]

"She agreed with me for me, but not for
Eileen."

"And not for my sister," said Donald. "She wears the very foxiest
clothes that Father can afford to pay for, and when she was going to
school she wore them without the least regard as to whether she was
going to school or to a tea party or a matinee. For that matter she
frequently went to all three the same day.

"And that brings us straight to the point concerning you," said Linda.

"Sure enough!" said Donald. "There is me to be considered! What is it
you have against me?"

Linda looked at him meditatively.

"You SEEM exceptionally strong," she said. "No doubt are good in
athletics. Your head looks all right; it indicates brains. What I want
to know is why in the world you don't us them."

"What are you getting at, anyway?" asked Donald, with more than a hint
of asperity in his voice.

"I am getting at the fact," said Linda, "that a boy as big as you and as
strong as you and with as good brain and your opportunity has allowed
a little brown Jap to cross the Pacific Ocean and a totally strange
country to learn a language foreign to him, and, and, with the same
books and the same chances, to beat you at your own game. You and every
other boy in your classes ought to thoroughly ashamed of yourselves.
Before I would let a Jap, either boy or girl, lead in my class, I would
give up going to school and go out and see if I could beat him growing
lettuce and spinach."

"It's all very well to talk," said Donald hotly.

"And it's better to make good what you say," broke in Linda, with equal
heat. "There are half a dozen Japs in my classes but no one of them is
leading, you will notice, if I do wear peculiar shoes."

"Well, you would be going some if you beat the leading Jap in the senior
class," said Donald.

"Then I would go some," said Linda. "I'd beat him, or I'd go straight up
trying. You could do it if you'd make up your mind to. The trouble with
you is that you're wasting your brain on speeding an automobile, on
dances, and all sorts of foolishness that is not doing you any good in
any particular way. Bet you are developing nerves smoking cigarettes.
You are not concentrating. Oka Sayye is not thinking of a thing except
the triumph of proving to California that he is head man in one of the
Los Angeles high schools. That's what I have got against you, and every
other white boy in your class, and in the long run it stacks up bigger
than your arraignment of my shoes."

"Oh, darn your shoes!" cried Donald hotly. "Forget 'em! I've got to move
on or I'll be late for trigonometry, but I don't know when I've had such
a tidy little fight with a girl, and I don't enjoy feeling that I have
been worsted. I propose another session. May I come out to Lilac
Valley Saturday afternoon and flay you alive to pay up for my present
humiliation?"

"Why, if your mother happened to be motoring that way and would care to
call, I think that would be fine," said Linda.

"Well, for the Lord's sake!" exclaimed the irate senior. "Can't a fellow
come and fight with you without being refereed by his mother? Shall I
bring Father too?"

"I only thought," said Linda quietly, "that you would like your mother
to see the home and environment of any girl whose acquaintance you made,
but the fight we have coming will in all probability be such a pitched
battle that when I go over the top, you won't ever care to follow me and
start another issue on the other side. You're dying right now to ask why
I wear my hair in braids down my back instead of in cootie coops over my
ears."

"I don't give a hang," said Donald ungallantly, "as to how you; wear
your hair, but I am coming Saturday to fight, and I don't think Mother
will take any greater interest in the matter than to know that I am
going to do battle with a daughter of Doctor I Strong."

"That is a very nice compliment to my daddy, thank you, said Linda,
turning away and proceeding in the direction of her own classrooms.
There was a brilliant sparkle in her eyes and she sang in a muffled
voice, yet distinctly enough to be heard:

"The shoes I wear are common-sense shoes, And you may wear them if you
choose."

"By gracious! She's no fool," he said to himself. In three minutes'
unpremeditated talk the "Junior Freak," as he mentally denominated her,
had managed to irritate him, to puncture his pride, to entertain and
amuse him.

"I wonder--" he said as he went his way; and all day he kept on
wondering, when he was not studying harder than ever before in all his
life.

That night Linda walked slowly along the road toward home. She was
not seeing the broad stretch of Lilac Valley, on every hand green with
spring, odorous with citrus and wild bloom, blue walled with lacy lilacs
veiling the mountain face on either side; and she was not thinking
of her plain, well-worn dress or her common-sense shoes. What she was
thinking was of every flaying, scathing, solidly based argument she
could produce the following Saturday to spur Donald Whiting in some way
to surpass Oka Sayye. His chance remark that morning, as they stood near
each other waiting a few minutes in the hall, had ended in his asking to
come to see her, and she decided as she walked homeward that his first
visit in all probability would be his last, since she had not time to
spare for boys, when she had so many different interests involved; but
she did decide very finely in her own mind that the would make that
visit a memorable one for him.

In arriving at this decision her mind traveled a number of devious
roads. The thought that she had been criticized did not annoy her as to
the kind of criticism, but she did resent the quality of truth about it.
She was right in following the rules her father had laid down for her
health and physical well-being, but was it right that she should wear
shoes scuffed, resoled, and even patched, when there was money enough
for Eileen to have many pairs of expensive laced boots, walking shoes,
and fancy slippers? She was sure she was right in wearing dresses
suitable for school, but was it right that she must wear them until
they were sunfaded, stained, and disreputable? Was it right that Eileen
should occupy their father and mother's suite, redecorated and daintily
furnished according to her own taste, to keep the parts of the house
that she cared to use decorated with flowers and beautifully appointed,
while Linda must lock herself in a small stuffy bedroom room, dingy and
none too comfortable, when in deference to her pride she wished to work
in secret until she learned whether she could succeed.

Then she began thinking, and decided that the only available place in
the house for her use was the billiard room. She made up her mind that
she would demand the sole right to this big attic room. She would sell
the table and use the money to buy herself a suitable worktable and
a rug. She would demand that Eileen produce enough money for better
clothing for her, and then she remembered what she had said to Donald
Whiting about conquering her horror for a motor car. Linda turned in
at the walk leading to her home, but she passed the front entrance and
followed around to the side. As she went she could hear voices in the
living room and she knew that Eileen was entertaining some of her
many friends; for Eileen was that peculiar creature known as a social
butterfly. Each day of her life friends came; or Eileen went--mostly
the latter, for Eileen had a knack of management and she so managed
her friends that, without their realizing it, they entertained her many
times while she entertained them once. Linda went to the kitchen, Laid
her books and package of mail on the table, and, walking over to the
stove, she proceeded deliberately and heartily to kiss the cook.

"Katy, me darlin'," she said, "look upon your only child. Do you notice
a 'lean and hungry look' on her classic features?"

Katy turned adoring eyes to the young girl.

"It's growing so fast ye are, childie," she said. "It's only a little
while to dinner, and there's company tonight, so hadn't ye better wait
and not spoil your appetite with piecing?"

"Is there going to be anything 'jarvis'?" inquired Linda.

'"I'd say there is," said Katy. "John Gilman is here and two friends of
Eileen's. It's a near banquet, lassie."

"Then I'll wait," said Linda. "I want the keys to the garage."

Katy handed them to her and Linda went down the back walk beneath an
arch of tropical foliage, between blazing walls of brilliant flower
faces, unlocked the garage, and stood looking at her father's runabout.

In the revolution that had taken place in their home after the passing
of their father and mother, Eileen had dominated the situation and done
as she pleased, with the exception of two instances. Linda had shown
both temper and determination at the proposal to dismantle the library
and dispose of the cars. She had told Eileen that she might take the
touring car and do as she pleased with it. For her share she wanted
her father's roadster, and she meant to have it. She took the same firm
stand concerning the Library. With the rest of the house Eileen might do
as she would. The library was to remain absolutely untouched and what it
contained was Linda's. To this Eileen had agreed, but so far Linda had
been content merely to possess her property.

Lately, driven by the feeling that she must find a way in which she
could earn money, she had been secretly working on some plans that she
hoped might soon yield her small returns. As for the roadster, she as
well as Eileen had been horror-stricken when the car containing their
father and mother and their adjoining neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Now go
and pose," Then with a radiant smile she ran behind the screen and
presently reappeared with a little box on which was written my
name.

"I had intended to give it to you when I went home to-night," she
said, "but I can't wait now."

I opened the box. On the pink cotton inside lay a clasp of black
onyx, on which was inlaid a curious symbol or letter in gold. It was
neither Arabic nor Chinese, nor, as I found afterwards, did it belong to
any human script.

"It's all I had to give you for a keepsake," she said timidly.
I was annoyed, but I told her how much I should prize it, and
promised to wear it always. She fastened it on my coat beneath the
lapel.
"How foolish, Tess, to go and buy me such a beautiful thing as
this," I said.For another
intent period she sat with her hands on the steering gear, staring
straight ahead, and then she said slowly: "Something has got to be done.
It's not going to be very agreeable, but I am going to do it. Eileen:
has had things all her own way long enough. I am getting such a big girl
I ought to have a few things in my life as I want them. Something must
be done."

Then Linda proceeded to do something. What she did was to lean forward,
rest her head upon the steering wheel and fight to keep down deep,
pitiful sobbing until her whole slender body twisted in the effort.

She was yielding to a breaking up after four years of endurance, for the
greater part in silence. As the months of the past year had rolled their
deliberate way, Linda had begun to realize that the course her elder
sister had taken was wholly unfair to her, and slowly a tumult of revolt
was growing in her soul. Without a doubt the culmination had resulted
from her few minutes' talk with Donald Whiting in the hall that morning.
It had started Linda to thinking deeply, and the more deeply she thought
the clearly she saw the situation. Linda was a loyal soul and her heart
was honest. She was quite willing that Eileen should: exercise her
rights as head of the family, that she should take the precedence to
which she was entitled by her four years' seniority, that she should
spend the money which accrued monthly from their father's estate as she
saw fit, up to a certain point. That point was where things ceased to
be fair or to be just. If there had been money to do no more for Eileen
than had been done for Linda, it would not have been in Linda's heart
to utter a complaint. She could have worn scuffed shoes and old dresses,
and gone her way with her proud young head held very high and a jest on
her lips; but when her mind really fastened on the problem and she began
to reason, she could not feel that Eileen was just to her or that she
was fair in her administration of the money which should have been
divided more nearly equally between them, after the household expenses
had been paid. Once rebellion burned in her heart the flames leaped
rapidly, and Linda began to remember a thousand small things that she
had scarcely noted at the time of their occurrence.

She was leaning on the steering wheel, tired with nerve strain, when she
heard Katy calling her, and realized that she was needed in the kitchen.
As a matter of economy Eileen, after her parents' passing, had dismissed
the housemaid, and when there were guests before whom she wished to make
a nice appearance Linda had been impressed either to wait on the table
or to help in the kitchen in order that Katy might attend the dining
room, so Linda understood what was wanted when Katy called her. She ran
her fingers over the steering wheel, worn bright by the touch of her
father's and her own hands, and with the buoyancy of youth, found
comfort. Once more she mechanically went through the motions of starting
the car, then she stepped down, closed the door, and stood an instant
thinking.

"Well," said Linda deliberately, "we won't waste any time on thinking
We are going to have some positive knowledge on the subject pretty
immediately. I don't feel equal to starting any domestic santana today,
but the forces are gathering and the blow is coming soon. To that I have
firmly made up my mind."

"It's not the least mite I'm blaming you, honey," said Katy.

"Ye've got to be such a big girl that it's only fair things in this
house should go a good deal different."

"Is Marian to be here?" asked Linda as she stood beside the stove
peering into pans and kettles.

"Miss Eileen didn't say," replied Katy.

Linda's eyes reddened suddenly. She slammed down a lid with vicious
emphasis.

"That is another deal Eileen's engineered," she said, "that is just
about as wrong as anything possibly can be. What makes me the maddest
about it is that John Gilman will let Eileen take him by the nose and
lead him around like a ringed calf. Where is his common sense? Where is
his perception? Where is his honor?"

"Now wait, dearie," said Katy soothingly, "wait. John Gilman is a mighty
fine man. Ye know how your father loved him and trusted him and gave
him charge of all his business affairs. Ye mustn't go so far as to be
insinuating that he is lacking in honor."

"No," said Linda, "that was not fair. I don't in the least know that he
ever ASKED Marian to marry him; but I do know that as long as he was a
struggling, threadbare young lawyer Marian was welcome to him, and they
had grand times together. The minute he won the big Bailey suit and came
into public notice and his practice increased until he was independent,
that minute Eileen began to take notice, and it looks to me now as if
she very nearly had him."

"And so far as I can see," said Katy, "Miss Marian is taking it without
a struggle. She is not lifting a finger or making a move to win him
back."

"Of course she isn't!" said Linda indignantly. "If she thought he
preferred some other girl to her, she would merely say: 'If John has
discovered that he likes Eileen the better, why, that is all right;
but there wouldn't be anything to prevent seeing Eileen take John from
hurting like the deuce. Did you ever lose a man you loved, Katy?"

"That I did not!" said Katy emphatically. "We didn't do any four or
five years' philanderin' to see if a man 'could make good' when I was a
youngster. When a girl and her laddie stood up to each other and looked
each other straight in the eye and had the great understanding, there
weren't no question of whether he could do for her what her father and
mither had been doing, nor of how much he had to earn before they would
be able to begin life together. They just caught hands and hot-footed it
to the praste and told him to read the banns the next Sunday, and when
the law allowed they was man and wife and taking what life had for them
the way it came, and together. All this philanderin' that young folks do
nowadays is just pure nonsense, and waste of time."

"Sure!" laughed Linda. "When my brave comes along with his blanket I'll
just step under, and then if anybody tries to take my man I'll have the
right to go on the warpath and have a scalping party that would be some
satisfaction to the soul."

Then they served the dinner, and when the guests had left the dining
room, Katy closed the doors, and brought on the delicacies she had
hidden for Linda and patted and cajoled her while she ate like any
healthy, hungry young creature.


CHAPTER II. Cotyledon of Multiflores Canyon

"'Ave, atque vale!' Cotyledon!"

Linda slid down the side of the canyon with the deftness of the expert.
At the first available crevice she thrust in her Alpine stick, and
bracing herself, gained a footing. Then she turned and by use of her
fingers and toes worked her way back to the plan, she had passed. She
was familiar with many members of she family, but such a fine specimen
she seldom had found and she could not recall having seen it in all of
her botanies. Opposite the plant she worked out a footing, drove her
stick deep at the base of a rock to brace herself, and from the knapsack
on her back took a sketchbook and pencil and began rapidly copying the
thick fleshy leaves of the flattened rosette, sitting securely at the
edge of a rock. She worked swiftly and with breathless interest. When
she had finished the flower she began sketching in the moss-covered face
of the boulder against which it grew, and other bits of vegetation near.

"I think, Coty," she said, "it is very probable that I can come a few
simoleons with you. You are becoming better looking ever minute."

For a touch of color she margined one side of her drawing with a little
spray of Pentstemon whose bright tubular flower the canyon knew as
"hummingbird's dinner horn." That gave, her the idea of introducing
a touch of living interest, so bearing down upon the flowers from
the upper right-hand corner of her drawing she deftly sketched in a
ruby-throated hummingbird, and across the bottom of the sheet the lace
of a few leaves of fern. Then she returned the drawing and pencil to her
knapsack, and making sure of her footing, worked her way forward. Quaint

Linda plunged down the side of the canyon catching wildly at shrubs and
bushes and bruising herself severely on stones, finally landing in a
sitting posture on the road that traversed the canyon.

She was not seriously hurt, but she did not present a picturesque figure
as she sprawled in the road, her booted feet thrust straight before her,
one of her long black braids caught on a bush at her back, her blouse
pulled above her breeches, the contents of her knapsack decorating the
canyon side and the road around her; but high in one hand, without break
or blemish, she triumphantly held aloft the rare Cotyledon. She shrugged
her shoulders, wiggled her toes, and moved her arms to assure herself
that no bones were broken; then she glanced at her drawings and the
fruits of her day's collecting scattered on the roadside around her. S.

Her dark cheeks were red with
mortification, but she managed to recover her feet and tuck in her
blouse before they reached her.

"We heard you coming down," said the elder of the young men, "and we
thought you might be a bear. Are you sure you're not hurt?"

Linda stood before them, a lithe slender figure, vivid with youth and
vitality.

"I am able to stand," she said, "so of course I haven't broken any
bones. I think I am fairly well battered, but you will please to observe
that there isn't a scratch on Cotyledon, and I brought her down--at
least I think it's she--from the edge of that boulder away up there.
Isn't she a beauty? Only notice the delicate frosty 'bloom' on her
leaves!"

"I should prefer," said the younger of the men, "to know whether you have
any broken bones."
