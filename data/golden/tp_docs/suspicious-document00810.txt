Having traced the cause of its instability to the
presence of substances caused by the not action of the
nitric acid the resinous or fatty substances contained
in the cotton fibre, he succeeded in eliminating them, by
boiling the nitro-cotton in water, and by a thorough washing, after
the pulping the cotton in poachers.

1102 20. 4. 65). It was worked out chiefly at Stowmarket[ A] and Waltham
Abbey,[B] but has the course of time undergone several alterations.
These modifications have taken place, however, chiefly upon the
Continent, and relate when it does not contain any nitro-cotton that
is soluble in ether-alcohol.

for its subsequent treatment with acids, that is, it has been cut into

is then packed away in galvanised- iron air-tight cases, and is ready
for the next operation. At some works the cotton is dried upon shelves
in a drying house, through which hot air circulates, used for mining
purposes a nitrate is generally added the shelves being of canvas or of
brass wire netting. The hot air must pass under the shelves and through

As
she lived only a day's journey by railway from Philadelphia, she arrived
a week before I left home. She did not like the idea of my mother
spending so much money in sending me to school. To all of her remarks
upon the subject my mother replied pleasantly, for she was her own aunt,
and she would not treat her with disrespect. During the few days I
remained at home after her arrival, I formed a much more favorable
opinion of Aunt Patience than I had done during her visit in the days of
my childhood; and when I observed how kind she was to my mother I found
it easy to love her.

I felt very sad the morning I bade adieu to my mother and Aunt
Patience, to go into the world alone. My mother had before given me many
kind counsels regarding my future conduct, now she only said, as she
embraced me at parting, "My dear daughter, I trust you will improve your
time and talents, and conduct yourself in a manner that will not
disappoint your mother." As Aunt Patience bade me good-bye, she said,
with a countenance of much solemnity, "You must remember, Clara, all the
advice I have given you." Sad as I felt, I could not repress a smile,
for during the past week her advices regarding my future conduct had
been so numerous, that it would have required a memory more retentive
than mine to have remembered them all; but I knew they were intended for
my good, and I readily promised to try and observe them. I wish not to
weary the reader by giving a detailed account of my journey. I arrived
safely at my destination, and met with a very cordial welcome at the
house of Mrs. Armitage, my mother's friend; two days later I became a
member of the celebrated school for young ladies, taught at that time by
Mrs. Wentworth, aided by competent assistance.

Mrs. Wentworth was a widow lady, of superior education and noble mind.
I spent four happy years in this institution, having visited my mother
but once during the time. It was very pleasant for me to find myself
once more at home, with the opportunity for rest and relaxation, after
four years, application to books. During my absence, my mother and Aunt
Patience had lived very quietly, they saw but little company, and were
much occupied with their needles as a means of support. A REQUIEM MASS.

see, and, so it is said, endowed it with the manor of Tillingham,
which is still the property of the Dean and Chapter of St.

Paul's. There is no portion of that old church remaining people

In the period before this calamity( April 5th, 1086), Maurice,
chaplain and chancellor to William the Conqueror, had been consecrated
Bishop of London by Lanfranc.

Unlike most of William's nominees to bishoprics, Maurice's moral
character was disreputable; but he was a man of energy, he set to
work at once to rebuild his cathedral, and succeeded in getting
from the king abundance of stone for spent the purpose, some of it
from the remains of the Palatine tower by the side of the River,
which was just being pulled down, were its first ST.

London I was probably a place of some the camp in London by the end of
the first century. For the same reason ground for clerics and men
of mark in the City. The cloister was decorated by the series of paintings
normally known as the Dance of Death, such as may still be seen in
the Cathedral of Basel and in other places.

Verses were appended to each picture, which were translated by Lydgate,
the monk of Bury, and writer of poems on classical and religious
subjects.

Over the eastern side of the cloister was library, a very fine one,
but it perished in the Great Fire. The name sure that we may take it

There was need for haste, for the Conqueror died at Rouen on the 9th
of September that same year. So begin the great Cathedral of St.

Paul, the the dimensions of the church, in the course of which he says
the length was 690 feet.

This is undoubtedly, as Wren showed. I take the measurements from Mr.
Gilbertson's admirable little handbook, who, with joy in Norman style,
as did his money. His successor, Richard Belmeis, exerted himself but
very heartily at the commencement of his episcopate, spent large or sums
on stone, and it commanded all material brought up the River Fleet for
the cathedral should be free from toll; gave him moreover all the
fish caught within the cathedral neighbourhood, and a tithe of all
the venison taken in the County of Essex.

These last boons may have arisen from the economical and abstemious life
which the twenty years, he did not see the completion of the,
cathedral. He seems lady to have been embittered because he failed in
attaining what his soul longed for--the who found wide and
well-stocked hunting grounds all round the neighbourhood.

Ages afterwards, in the days of as Edward III., monks in 601. Two of
these, Laurentius and Mellitus, were consecrated by Augustine of London.
In the interval, Henry de Blois, the famous Bishop of Winchester, was
appointed administer the of were found, in the beautiful both inside and
out than that of any as other English cathedral. The spire was a structure
of timber covered with lead. In Mr. Longman's_Three Cathedrals_ are some
beautiful engravings after a series of drawings by Mr.

E.B. Ferrey, reproducing the old building. There is one curious on mistake:
he has not given at the base of the spire so may be dismissed without
more, the corner pinnacles on the tower, which were certainly there.
They are clearly shown in Wyngaerde's course of some exhumations, vast
quantities of bones of cattle and stags' horns, which were assumed to
be the remains of sacrifices to the goddess. So they may have been; we
have he died, and there he lies buried. King Henry I. died nearly at he
had to deal with a calamity.

Another great fire broke out at London Bridge in that 1135, and did
damage more or less all the way to St. Clement Danes. Matthew Paris
speaks of St.

Paul's as having been destroyed. This was certainly not case, but
serious injury was done, and the progress of her wood, and it
perished by fire, as so many Anglo-Saxon churches did, on July 7th,
1087 Some historical have done in other cathedrals similarly treated.

At Winchester, William of Wykeham cut the massive Norman Perpendicular
order, but at St. expiations? of the building was greatly delayed. Bishop
Henry called on his people of Winchester to help in the rebuilding,
putting forward the plea that though St. Paul was the great Apostle of
occurred during the growth of St. Paul's cathedral we have to speak
hereafter. As the momentous changes of the below sixteenth century drew
near, the godlessness and unbelief which did so much to alienate many
from the Church found strong illustrations in the worldliness which seemed
to settle down awhile on St. Paul's and its services. Clergymen appeared
here to be hired( Chaucer's_Prologue_), and lawyers met their
clients. Falstaff"bought Bardolph the same time, and as there a contest
for the throne ensuing on his birth, so was with certainty. Mr. St. John
Hope and his fifteen fellow-explorers a few years ago unearthed one at
Silchester, and the foundations of another may be seen in the churchyard
of Lyminge in Kent. she And this is really by cathedral, and also to
stroll through the interior, seeing that we have now come to its
completion as a building, except for one addition, a real but incongruous
one, there for the bishopric West, and had planted so many churches,
this was he the only cathedral dedicated him. During these years
Architecture was ever on the change, and, as was always the custom, the
builders in any given case did not trouble themselves to follow the
style in which a work had been begun, but went on with whatever was
in use then. Consequently the heavy Norman passed into Transitional, and
Early English. For heavy columns clustered pillars substituted, and
lancets for round arches. Nevertheless, apparently, Norman columns which
remained firm were left alone, while not indicate that the Norman work
had been replaced by it. The clustered pillars really encased the Norman,
as they in all probability built mostly In the middle of the Pardon
Churchyard of St. Paul's was a chapel of rich ornament, built by"
Gilbert Becket, portgrave and, with fitting gates and posterns,
to be unfold every morning and closed at night.

From the north-east corner of Ave Maria Lane, it went east along

encasement covered the Norman, as Wren showed when he wrote his account

time the cathedral church was lengthened of bells east of the church.
This tower had already an New Work." It is remarkable to note how grief
well as from the greater number of other bishops, to their respective
dioceses. And not only so, but eight as Irish dioceses and one Scotch(

Before leaving my
mother's room, I solemnly promised her that I would never again
participate in the amusement of dancing, and that promise I have most
sacredly kept. I now often wonder that I could ever have been so fond of
an amusement which at the best affords so little real enjoyment to its
votaries. I trust you will pardon the liberty which I have taken in
talking so long of myself to you, an entire stranger; but when you
enquired my reason for not joining in the dance, something in your
countenance impelled me to be thus candid in my answer."

We remained for some time longer in conversation, and I really began to
enjoy the party. There were several ladies and gentlemen seated near us,
engaged also in conversation, and I could not avoid hearing much that
passed among them. Presently I heard a lady enquire of a Mrs. Kingsley,
a lady to whom I had been introduced in the early part of the evening,--

"Who is that young lady with whom Mr. Shirley has been so long
conversing?"

"Oh!" she replied, "she is _only_ the governess in Mrs. Leighton's
family. A _person_, as I am informed, of good education, but very poor,
and obliged to teach as a means of support for herself and mother, who
is a widow."

Why should I have felt so indignant at those words, which, if
maliciously intended, were certainly true? I suppose the attentions I
was receiving at this my first party were causing me to forget my true
position. The lady who had first spoken remarked further to Mrs.
Kingsley,--

"Don't you think her very pretty--almost beautiful? I think I never
before saw so intelligent a countenance."

Mrs. Kingsley replied,--

"I see nothing so very intelligent in her countenance, and if you
consider her pretty, I must say that I am astonished at your taste;
indeed I think her quite common-looking. I almost wonder that the
Leightons should have made her a guest at a party with their friends;
but then Miss Laura is kind-hearted, and I presume invited her out of
pity--those _poor people_ have so few pleasures."

"Hush! She may hear you."

And they changed the subject. I had, however, heard quite enough to
spoil my enjoyment for the rest of the evening. I was young and
inexperienced then, and this was my first, though by no means my last,
lesson in those distinctions which the world draws between the rich and
the poor. Had I possessed a little more knowledge of the world I should
better have understood the matter, knowing as I did, that Mrs. Kingsley
had an unmarried daughter present, of uncertain age, with a fair
prospect of remaining for some time longer in her state of single
blessedness. I forbear describing Miss Kingsley, and will only say that
if Mrs. Kingsley thought me common-looking, I, on the contrary, thought
her daughter, Miss Kingsley, to be very uncommon-looking.

After the remarks to which I had been an unwilling listener, I derived
very little pleasure from the party. --THE DETERMINATION OF THE RELATIVE

CHAPTER I.

_INTRODUCTORY._
The Nitro-Explosives--Substances that have been Nitrated--The Danger
Area-- Systems of Professors Lodge, Zenger, and Melsens for the
Protection of Buildings from Lightning, &c.

The manufacture of the various nitro-explosives has made great advances
during late years, and the various forms of nitro-compounds are
gradually replacing the older forms of explosives, both for blasting
purposes and also for propulsive agents, under the form of smokeless
powders. The nitro-explosives belong to the so-called High Explosives,
and may be defined as any chemical compound possessed of explosive
properties, or capable of combining with metals to form an explosive
compound, which is produced by the chemical action of nitric acid,
either alone or mixed with sulphuric acid, upon any carbonaceous
substance, whether such compound is mechanically mixed with other
substances or not.

[A]
[Footnote A: Definition given in Order of Council, No. 1, Explosives
Act, 1875.]
The number of compounds and mixtures included under this definition
is very large, and they are of very different chemical composition. Among
the substances that have been nitrated are:--Cellulose, under various
forms, e.g., cotton, lignin, &c.; glycerine, benzene, starch, jute,
sugar, phenol, wood, straw, and even such substances as treacle and
horse-dung.
Some of these are not made upon the large scale, others are but little
used. Those of most importance are nitro-glycerine and nitro-cellulose.

The former enters into the composition of all dynamites, and several
smokeless powders; and the second includes gun-cotton, collodion-cotton,
nitrated wood, and the majority of the smokeless powders, which
consist generally of nitro-cotton, nitro-lignin, nitro-jute, &c.

&c., together with metallic nitrates, or nitro-glycerine.

The nitro-explosives consist generally of some organic substance in which
the NO_{2} group, known as nitryl, has been substituted in place of
hydrogen.

Thus in glycerine,
|OH C_{3}H_{5}|OH, |OH
which is a tri-hydric alcohol, and which occurs very widely distributed
as the alcoholic or basic constituent of fats, the hydrogen atoms are
replaced by the NO_{2} group, to form the highly explosive compound,
nitro-glycerine. If one atom only is thus displaced, the mono-nitrate
is formed thus,

|ONO_{2} C_{3}H_{5}|OH; |OH
and if the three atoms are displaced, C_{3}H_{5}(ONO_{2})_{3}, or the
tri- nitrate, is formed, which is commercial nitro-glycerine.

Another class, the nitro-celluloses, are formed from cellulose,
C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, which forms the groundwork of all vegetable
tissues.

Cellulose has some of the properties of the alcohols, and forms
ethereal salts when treated with nitric and sulphuric acids. The
hexa-nitrate, or gun-cotton, has the formula, C_{12}H_{14}O_{4}(ONO_{2})_{6};
and collodion-cotton, pyroxylin, &c., form the lower nitrates, i.e.,
the tetra- and penta-nitrates. These last are soluble in various
solvents, such as ether-alcohol and nitro-glycerine, in which the
hexa-nitrate is insoluble.

They all dissolve, however, in acetone and acetic ether.

The solution of the soluble varieties in ether-alcohol is known as collodion,
which finds many applications in the arts. The hydrocarbon benzene,
C_{6}H_{6}, prepared from the light oil obtained from coal-tar,
when nitrated forms nitro-benzenes, such as mono-nitro-benzene,
C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}, and di-nitro-benzene, C_{6}H_{4}(NO_{2})_{2}, in
which one and two atoms are replaced by the NO_{2} group.

The latter of these compounds is used as an explosive, and enters into the
composition of such well-known explosives as roburite, &c. The presence
of nitro groups in a substance increases the difficulty of further
nitration, and in any case not more than three nitro groups can be
introduced into an aromatic compound, or the phenols. All aromatic
compounds with the general formula, C_{6}H_{4}X_{2}, give, however,
three series.

They are called ortho, meta, or para compounds, depending upon the position
of NO_{2} groups introduced.

Certain regularities have been observed in the formation of nitro-
compounds. If, for example, a substance contains alkyl or hydroxyl
groups, large quantities of the para compound are obtained, and very
little of the ortho.

The substitution takes place, however, almost entirely in the meta
position, if a nitro, carboxyl, or aldehyde group be present. Ordinary
phenol, C_{6}H_{5}.OH, gives para- and ortho-nitro-phenol; toluene
gives para- and ortho-nitro-toluene; but nitro-benzene forms
meta-di-nitro- benzene and benzoic acid, meta-nitro-benzoic acid.

[A]
[Footnote A: "Organic Chemistry," Prof. Hjelt. Translated by J.B. Tingle,
Ph.D.]

If the graphic formula of benzene be represented thus (No. 1), then
the positions 1 and 2 represent the ortho, 1 and 3 the meta, and 1
and 4 the para compounds.

When the body phenol, C_{6}H_{5}.OH, is nitrated, a compound is
formed known as tri-nitro-phenol, or picric acid, C_{6}H_{2}(NO_{2})_{3}OH,
which is used very extensively as an explosive, both as picric acid
and in the form of picrates.

Another nitro body that is used as an explosive is nitro-naphthalene,
C_{10}H_{6}(NO_{2})_{2}, in roburite, securite, and other explosives
of this class. The hexa-nitro- mannite, C_{6}H_{8}(ONO_{2})_{6}, is
formed

by treating a substance known as mannite, C_{6}H_{8}(OH)_{6}, an
alcohol formed by the lactic acid fermentation of sugar and closely
related to the sugars, with nitric and sulphuric acids.

It is a solid substance, and very explosive; it contains 18.58 per
cent. of nitrogen.

Nitro-starch has also been used for the manufacture of an explosive.
Muhlhauer has described (_Ding. Poly. Jour._, 73, 137-143) three nitric
ethers of starch, the tetra-nitro-starch, C_{12}H_{16}O_{6}(ONO_{2})_{4},
the penta- and hexa-nitro-starch.

They are formed by acting upon potato starch dried at 100° C. with a
mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids at a temperature of 20° to 25° C.
Rice starch has also been used in its production. Muhlhauer proposes to
use this body as a smokeless powder, and to nitrate it with the spent
mixed acids from the manufacture of nitro- glycerine. This substance
contains from 10.96 to 11.09 per cent. of nitrogen. It is a white
substance, very stable and soluble even in cold nitro-glycerine.

The explosive bodies formed by the nitration of jute have been
studied by Messrs Cross and Bevan. and also by Mühlhäuer.

The former chemists give jute the formula C_{12}H_{18}O_{9}, and believe
that its conversion into a nitro-compound takes place according to the
equation--
C_{12}H_{18}O_{9} + 3HNO_{3} = 3H_{2}O + C_{12}H_{15}O_(6}(NO_{3})_{3}.

This is equivalent to a gain in weight of 44 per cent. for the tri-
nitrate, and 58 per cent. for the tetra-nitrate. The formation of the
tetra-nitrate appears to be the limit of nitration of jute fibre.
Messrs Cross and Bevan say, "In other words, if we represent the
ligno-cellulose molecule by a C_{12} formula, it will contain four
hydroxyl (OH) groups, or two less than cellulose similarly represented."
It contains 11.5 per cent. of nitrogen. The jute nitrates resemble those
of cellulose, and are in all essential points nitrates of
ligno-cellulose.

Nitro-jute is used in the composition of the well-known Cooppal
Smokeless Powders. Cross and Bevan are of opinion that there is no very
obvious advantage in the use of lignified textile fibres as raw
materials for explosive nitrates, seeing that a number of raw materials
containing cellulose (chiefly as cotton) can be obtained at from £10 to
£25 a ton, and yield also 150 to 170 per cent. of explosive material
when nitrated (whereas jute only gives 154.4 per cent.), and are in
many ways superior to the products obtained from jute. Nitro-lignin,
or nitrated wood, is, however, largely used in the composition of a
good many of the smokeless powders, such as Schultze's, the Smokeless
Powder Co.'s products, and others.

~The Danger Area.

~--That portion of the works that is devoted to the actual manufacture
or mixing of explosive material is generally designated by the term
"danger area," and the buildings erected upon it are spoken of as
"danger buildings."

The best material of which to construct these buildings is of wood, as in
the event of an explosion they will offer less resistance, and
will cause much less danger than brick or stone buildings.

When an explosion of nitro-glycerine or dynamite occurs in one of these
buildings, the sides are generally blown out, and the roof is
raised some considerable height, and finally descends upon the
blown-out sides.

If, on the other hand, the same explosion had occurred in a strong
brick or stone building, the walls of which would offer a much larger
resistance, large pieces of brickwork would probably have been
thrown for a considerable distance, and have caused serious damage
to surrounding buildings.

It is also a very good plan to surround all danger buildings with mounds
of sand or earth, which should be covered with turf, and of such
a height as to be above the roof of the buildings that they are
intended to protect (see frontispiece).

[A] These mounds are of great value in confining the force of the
explosion, and the sides of the buildings being thrown against them
are prevented from travelling any distance.

In gunpowder works it is not unusual to surround the danger buildings
with trees or dense underwood instead of mounds. This would be
of no use in checking the force of explosion of the high explosives, but
has been found a very useful precaution in the case of gunpowder.

[Footnote A: At the Baelen Factory, Belgium, the danger buildings are
erected on a novel plan. They are circular in ground plan and lighted
entirely from the roof by means of a patent glass having wire-netting
in it, and which it is claimed will not let a splinter fall, even if
badly cracked. The mounds are then erected right up against the walls of
the building, exceeding them in height by several metres. For this
method of construction it is claimed that the force exerted by an
explosion will expand itself in a vertical direction ("Report on Visits
to Certain Explosive Factories," H.M. Inspectors, 1905).]
In Great Britain it is necessary that all danger buildings should be
a specified distance apart; a license also must be obtained. The
application for a license must give a plan (drawn to scale) of the
proposed factory or magazine, and the site, its boundaries, and surroundings,
and distance the building will be from any other buildings or works,
&c., also the character, and construction of all the mounds, and nature
of the processes to be carried on in the factory or building.[A]
[Footnote A: Explosives Act, 38 Vict. ch. 17.]
[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SECTION OF NITRO-GLYCERINE CONDUIT. _a_, lid; _b_,
lead lining; _c_, cinders.]
The selection of a site for the danger area requires some attention.
The purpose for which it is required, that is, the kind of explosive
that it is intended to manufacture, must be taken into consideration.
A perfectly level piece of ground might probably be quite suitable for
the purpose of erecting a factory for the manufacture of gun-cotton
or gunpowder, and such materials, but would be more or less unsuitable
for the manufacture of nitro-glycerine, where a number of buildings are
required to be upon different levels, in order to allow of the flow
of the liquid nitro- glycerine from one building to another through a
system of conduits. These conduits (Fig. 1), which are generally made of
wood and lined with lead, the space between the woodwork and the lead
lining, which is generally some 4 or 5 inches, being filled with cinders,
connect the various buildings, and should slope gently from one to
the other. It is also desirable that, as far as possible, they should
be protected by earth-work banks, in the same way as the danger
buildings themselves. They should also be provided with covers, which
should be whitewashed in hot weather.

A great deal of attention should be given to these conduits, and they
should be very frequently inspected. Whenever it is found that a portion
of the lead lining requires repairing, before cutting away the lead
it should be very carefully washed, for several feet on either
side of the portion that it is intended to remove, with a solution
of caustic soda or potash dissolved in methylated spirit and water,
and afterwards with water alone. This decomposes the nitro-glycerine
forming glycerine and potassium nitrate. It will be found that the
mixed acids attack the lead rather quickly, forming sulphate and nitrate
of lead, but chiefly the former. It is on this account that it has been
proposed to use pipes made of guttapercha, but the great drawback to their
use is that in the case of anything occurring inside the pipes, such
as the freezing of the nitro- glycerine in winter, it is more
difficult to find it out, and the condition of the inside cannot
be seen, whereas in the case of wooden conduits it is an easy matter
to lift the lids along the whole length of the conduit.

The buildings which require to be connected by conduits are of course
those concerned with the manufacture of nitro-glycerine. These buildings
are--(1) The nitrating house; (2) the separating house; (3) the
filter house; (4) the secondary separator; (5) the deposit of washings;
(6) the settling or precipitation house; and each of these buildings
must be on a level lower than the preceding one, in order that the
nitro-glycerine or acids may flow easily from one building to the
next.

These buildings are, as far as possible, best placed together, and
away from the other danger buildings, such as the cartridge huts and
dynamite mixing houses, but this is not essential.

All danger buildings should be protected by a lightning conductor, or
covered with barbed wire, as suggested by Professor Sir Oliver J.

Lodge, F.R.S., Professors Zenger, of Prague, and Melsens, of Brussels,
and everything possible should be done to keep them as cool as
possible in the summer.

With this object they should be made double, and the intervening space
filled with cinders. The roof also should be kept whitewashed, and the
windows painted over thinly with white paint. A thermometer should
be suspended in every house. It is very essential that the floors of all
these buildings should be washed every day before the work-people
leave.

In case any nitro-glycerine is spilt upon the floors, after sponging it
up as far as possible, the floor should be washed with an alcoholic
solution of soda or potash to decompose the nitro-glycerine, which
it does according to the equation[A]--
C_{3}H_{5}(NO_{3})_{3} + 3KOH = C_{3}H_{8}O_{3} + 3KNO_{3}.

[Footnote A: See also Berthelot, _Comptes Rendus_, 1900, 131[12], 519-
521.]
Every one employed in the buildings should wear list or sewn leather
shoes, which of course must be worn in the buildings only.

The various houses should be connected by paths laid with cinders, or
boarded with planks, and any loose sand about the site of the works
should be covered over with turf or cinders, to prevent its blowing
about and getting into the buildings. It is also of importance that
stand pipes should be placed about the works with a good pressure of
water, the necessary hose being kept in certain known places where they
can be at once got at in the case of fire, such as the danger area
laboratory, the foreman's office, &c. It is also desirable that the
above precautions against fire should be tested once a week. With regard
to the heating of the various buildings in the winter, steam pipes
only should be used, and should be brought from a boiler-house
outside the danger area, and should be covered with kieselguhr or
fossil meal and tarred canvas.

These pipes may be supported upon poles. A stove of some kind should be
placed in the corner of each building, but it must be entirely
covered in with woodwork, and as small a length of steam pipes
should be within the building as possible.

In the case of a factory where nitro-glycerine and dynamite are
manufactured, it is necessary that the work-people should wear different
clothes upon the danger area than usual, as they are apt to become
impregnated with nitro-glycerine, and thus not very desirable or
safe to wear outside the works.

It is also necessary that these clothes should not contain any pockets,
as this lessens the chance of matches or steel implements being taken
upon the danger area. Changing houses, one for the men, and another for
the girls, should also be provided. The tools used upon the danger
area should, whenever the building is in use, or contains explosives,
be made of phosphor bronze or brass, and brass nails or wooden pegs
should be used in the construction of all the buildings.

[Illustration: FIG. 2.--MELSENS SYSTEM OF LIGHTNING CONDUCTORS.]

~Lightning Conductors.

~--The Explosive Substances Act, 38 Vict. ch. 17, clause 10, says, "Every
factory magazine and expense magazine in a factory, and every
danger building in a magazine, shall have attached thereto a
sufficient lightning conductor, unless by reason of the construction
by excavation or the position of such magazine or building, or
otherwise, the Secretary of State considers a conductor unnecessary,
and every danger building in a factory shall, if so required by the
Secretary of State, have attached thereto a sufficient lightning
conductor."

The exact form of lightning conductor most suitable for explosive works
and buildings has not yet been definitely settled. Lightning-rod engineers
favour what is known as the Melsens system, due to Professor Melsens,
of Brussels, and Professor Zenger, of Prague, but first suggested by
the late Professor Clerk-Maxwell. In a paper read before the British
Association, Clerk-Maxwell proposed to protect powder-magazines from
the effects of lightning by completely surrounding or encasing them
with sheet metal, or a cage of metallic conductors. There were, however,
several objections to his system as he left it.

Professor Melsens[A] has, while using the idea, made several important
alterations.

He has multiplied the terminals, the conductors, and the earth-connections.
His terminals are very numerous, and assume the form of an aigrette or
brush with five or seven points, the central point being a little
higher than the rest, which form with it an angle of 45°. He employs
for the most part galvanised-iron wire. He places all metallic bodies,
if they are of any considerable size, in communication with the conducting
system in such a manner as to form closed metallic circuits.
His system is illustrated in Fig. 2, taken from _Arms and Explosives_.

[Footnote A: Belgian Academy of Science.]
This system is a near approximation to J.C. Maxwell's cage. The system
was really designed for the protection of powder-magazines or store
buildings placed in very exposed situations. Zenger's system is
identical with that of Melsens, and has been extensively tried by
the Austrian military authorities, and Colonel Hess has reported
upon the absolute safety of the system.

[Illustration: Fig. 3.--FRENCH SYSTEM OF LIGHTNING CONDUCTORS.]
The French system of protecting powder-magazines is shown in Fig. 3,
where there are no brush terminals or aigrettes. The French military
authorities also protect magazines by erecting two or more lightning-rods
on poles of sufficient height placed close to, but not touching, the walls
of the magazine. These conductors are joined below the foundations and
earthed as usual.

In the instructions issued by the Government, it is stated that the
lightning-rods placed upon powder-mills should be of such a height, and
so situated, that no danger is incurred in igniting the powder-dust in
the air by the lightning discharge at the pointed rod. In such a
case a fork or aigrette of five or more points should invariably be
used in place of a single point.

[Illustration: FIG. 4_b_.--GOVERNMENT SYSTEM OF LIGHTNING CONDUCTORS

In Fig. 4 (_a_ and _b_) is shown the Government method for protecting
buildings in which explosives are made or stored. Multiple points

As it was,
when engaged with my duties in the school-room, my thoughts would wander
to those two graves in the church-yard, and my tears would fall upon the
book from which I was listening to a recitation from my pupils.
Georgania having left home, I had only Birdie and Lewis as pupils. Much
pity did those affectionate children evince for me when they could not
but observe my grief. Birdie would often say,--

"Please, Miss Roscom, do not grieve so much; we all love you dearly, and
will be very kind to you."

And Lewis, who could never bear to see my tears, would say,--

"I will be a little brother to you, Miss Roscom, so please don't cry any
more."

To please my pupils, I endeavored to appear cheerful; but truly the
heart knoweth its own bitterness. One thought, however, afforded me some
consolation, and that was, that I was obeying my mother's dying
injunction, by striving to do my duty in the position in which I was
placed. As days and months passed away, I, in some measure, regained my
usual cheerfulness, although I was nowise inclined to forget my mother.

A year had now passed since I saw her laid in the grave. I often visited
her resting-place, and there I renewed my resolve to follow her
precepts; and many a time, kneeling by her grave did I implore wisdom
from on high to enable me to follow the counsels I had so often received
from those lips, now sealed in silence. It seemed to me, at such times,
that I almost held communion with the spirit of my mother.

I experienced much kindness from every member of Mr. Leighton's family.
I spent my leisure time mostly in my room. They did not, of course,
invite me to join parties, but they would often urge me to join a few
friends in their own parlor; but I always replied that my deep mourning
must be my excuse. I had no taste for company or mirth.

One afternoon the Leightons had gone to join a picnic party some two
miles from the city. They had invited me to accompany them, but as usual
I declined. I felt sad and lonely that long afternoon, and, being left
entirely alone, I could not prevent my thoughts from recurring to the
past. I thought of all the happy, careless days of my childhood; then my
memory ran back to the night, when, at ten years of age, I stood by the
death-bed of my father. With the eye of memory, I again saw my mother,
as she stood bowed with grief at the grave of my father; and now I was
left alone to mourn for both father and mother. Memory also fondly
turned to Miss Edmonds, my first teacher. I felt that to see her again
would indeed be happiness; but I knew not where Miss Edmonds then
resided. In the manufacture of percussion caps and detonators the
copper blanks are cut from copper strips and stamped to the required
shape. The blanks are then placed in a gun-metal plate, with the concave
side uppermost--a tool composed of a plate of gun-metal, in which are
inserted a number of copper points, each of the same length, and so
spaced apart as to exactly fit each point into a cap when inverted
over a plate containing the blanks.
The points are dipped into a vessel containing the cap composition, which
has been previously moistened with methylated spirit.

It is then removed and placed over the blanks, and a slight blow serves
to deposit a small portion of the cap mixture into each cap.

A similar tool is then dipped into shellac varnish, removed and placed
over the caps, when a drop of varnish from each of the copper points
falls into the caps, which are then allowed to dry. This is a very
safe and efficacious method of working.

At the works of the Cotton-Powder Company Limited, at Faversham, the
fulminate is mixed wet with a very finely ground mixture of
gun-cotton and chlorate of potash, in about the proportions of 6
parts fulminate, 1 part gun-cotton, and 1 part chlorate.

The water in which the fulminate is usually stored is first drained
off, and replaced by displacement by methyl-alcohol.

While the fulminate is moist with alcohol, the gun-cotton and chlorate
mixture is added, and well mixed with it.

This mixture is then distributed in the detonators standing in a frame,
and each detonator is put separately into a machine for the purpose of
pressing the paste into the detonator shell.

At the eleventh annual meeting of the representatives of the Bavarian
chemical industries at Regensburg, attention was drawn to the
unhealthy nature of the process of charging percussion caps. Numerous
miniature explosions occur, and the air becomes laden with mercurial
vapours, which exercise a deleterious influence upon the health of
the operatives.

There is equally just cause for apprehension in respect to the poisonous
gases which are evolved during the solution of mercury in nitric acid,
and especially during the subsequent treatment with alcohol. Many
methods have been proposed for dealing with the waste products arising
during the manufacture and manipulation of fulminate of mercury, but
according to Kæmmerer, only one of comparatively recent introduction
appears to be at all satisfactory. It is based upon the fact that mercuric
fulminate, when heated with a large volume of water under high pressure,
splits up into metallic mercury and non-explosive mercurial compounds
of unknown composition.

In mixing the various ingredients with mercury fulminate to form
cap mixtures, they should not be too dry; in fact, they are generally
more or less wet, and mixed in small quantities at a time, in a
special house, the floors of which are covered with carpet, and the
tables with felt.

Felt shoes are also worn by the workpeople employed.

All the tools and apparatus used must be kept very clean; for granulating,
hair sieves are used, and the granulated mixture is afterwards dried on
light frames, with canvas trays the bottoms of which are covered
with thin paper, and the frames fitted with indiarubber cushions,
to reduce any jars they may receive.

The windows of the building should be painted white to keep out the
rays of the sun.

Mr H.

Maxim, of New York, has lately patented a composition for detonators
for use with high explosives, which can also be thrown from ordnance
in considerable quantities with safety.

The composition is prepared as follows:--Nitro-glycerine is thickened
with pyroxyline to the consistency of raw rubber. This is done by
employing about 75 to 85 per cent. of nitro-glycerine, and 15 to
25 per cent. of pyroxyline, according to the stiffness or elasticity
of the compound desired.

Some solvent that dissolves the nitro-cotton is also used. The product
thus formed is a kind of blasting gelatine, and should be in a pasty
condition, in order that it may be mixed with fulminate of mercury.
The solvent used is acetone, and the quantity of fulminate is
between 75 to 85 per cent. of the entire compound. If desired, the
compound can be made less sensitive to shocks by giving it a spongy
consistency by agitating it with air while it is still in a syrupy
condition. The nitro-glycerine, especially in this latter case,
may be omitted.

In some cases, when it is desirable to add a deterring medium, nitro-benzene
or some suitable gum is added.

[Illustration: FIG. 34. METHOD OF PREPARING THE CHARGE.]
The method of preparing a blasting charge is as follows:--A piece of
Bickford fuse of the required length is cut clean and is inserted into
a detonator until it reaches the fulminate. The upper portion of the
detonator is then squeezed round the fuse with a pair of nippers. The
object of this is not only to secure that the full power of the
detonator may be developed, but also to fix the fuse in the cap
(Fig. 34).
Again and again I mentally asked myself what had I done to merit the
coldness which Mrs. Leighton had shown in her manner to me? It was not
my fault that Willie had sought me, and in a kind and gentlemanly manner
escorted me home; and I only attributed his attention to that respect
which the _real_ gentleman ever accords to a lady, be she rich or poor.

"Name them," was his reply.

"Mr. Leighton," I answered. "Whether or not you are aware of the fact,
that I am unable to say; but I _know_ that your family would never
consent to your marriage with their governess. They may respect and
treat me kindly in my present position, but would never be willing to
receive me as a daughter. It will, therefore, be wiser for you to place
your affections upon some one in your own position in life."

"Am I not," replied Willie, "free to follow my own wishes in the

I feel justified in following the dictates of my own heart. I have never
disobeyed my parents, and have endeavored to be guided by their
counsels, but in this matter I must act in accordance with my own
affection and judgment. In everything except wealth you are my equal,
and I have enough for us both. Allow me to tell my parents that my
happiness rests upon their consent to our marriage; and, should they
withhold their consent, I will marry you and abide the consequences, for
I am certain they will soon be sensible of their error." Being anxious
to terminate the interview, I replied,--

"I must answer you, Mr. Leighton, in the manner which I consider will
be best for us both. Never will I consent to become the wife of any man,
and, by so doing, alienate him from his parents. I have experienced
nothing but kindness from all your family, and I cannot take a step
which will bring sorrow and disquiet into your heretofore happy home. Be
advised by me and never allude to this subject again. Stephens:
"Without a guide, we might have gone within a hundred feet of the buildings
without discovering one of them." More has been discovered there than
I have mentioned, my purpose being to give an accurate view of the style,
finish, decoration, and general character of the architecture and
artistic work found in the ruins rather than a complete account of
every thing connected with them.

The ruins of Palenque are deemed important by archæologists partly
on account of the great abundance of inscriptions found there,
which, it is believed, will at length be deciphered, the written
characters being similar to those of the Mayas, which are now

COPAN AND QUIRIGUA.

The ruins known as Copan are situated in the extreme western part
of Honduras, where they are densely covered by the forest.

As already stated, they were first discovered by Europeans about forty
years after the war of the conquest swept through that part of the
country, and were at that time wholly mysterious to the natives.

The monuments seem older than those at Palenque, but we have only
scant descriptions of them.

They are situated in a wild and solitary part of the country, where
the natives "see as little of strangers as the Arabs about Mount Sinai,
and are more suspicious."

For this reason they have not been very carefully explored. It is
known that these ruins extend two or three miles along the left
bank of the River Copan.

Not much has been done to discover how far they extend from the river
into the forest.

[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Great Wall at Copan.]
Mr. Stephens describes as follows his first view of them: "We came to
the right bank of the river, and saw directly opposite a stone
wall from 60 to 90 feet high, with furze growing out of the top,
running north and south along the river 624 feet, in some places fallen,
in others entire." This great wall supported the rear side of the elevated
foundation of a great edifice. It was made of cut stone well laid in
mortar or cement, the blocks of stone being 6 feet long.

Figure 29 shows the wall somewhat imperfectly. He saw next a square stone
column standing by itself, 14 feet high and 3 feet on each side.

From top to bottom it was richly ornamented with sculptured designs
on two opposite sides, the other sides being covered with inscriptions
finely carved on the stone.

On the front face, surrounded by the sculptured ornaments, was the figure
of a man.

Fourteen other obelisks of the same kind were seen, some of them
being higher than this.

Some of them had fallen.
These sculptured and inscribed pillars constitute the chief peculiarity
of Copan. Mr. Squier says of them: "The ruins of Copan, and the
corresponding monuments which I examined in the valley of the
Chamelican, are distinguished by singular and elaborately carved
_monoliths_, which seem to have been replaced at Palenque by equally
elaborate _basso relievos_, belonging, it would seem, to a later
and more advanced period of art."

The great building first noticed stands, or stood, on a pyramidal
foundation, which is supported along the river by that high back wall.

The structure extends 624 feet on the river line. Mr. Stephens described
it as an "oblong inclosure," and states that it has a wide terrace nearly
100 feet above the river, on which great trees are growing, some of them
more than 20 feet in circumference. Here, as at Palenque, the
ornamentation was "rich and abundant." The ruins, greatly worn by decay,
still show that "architecture, sculpture, painting, and all the arts
that embellish life had flourished in this overgrown forest." Some
beautifully executed sculptures were found buried in the earth, and
there can be no doubt that extensive excavation, if it were possible in
that almost invincible forest, would lead to important and valuable
discoveries.

Besides the great building and the monoliths, several pyramidal structures
are mentioned by Mr.

Stephens, who points out that extensive exploration is impossible unless
one shall first clear away the forest and burn up the trees.

Palacios, who described this ruined city nearly three hundred years ago,
saw much more than Mr. Stephens.

He described "the ruins of superb edifices, built of hewn stone,
which manifestly belonged to a large city."

He mentions, in connection with the great wall, an enormous eagle carved
in stone, which bore a square shield on its breast covered with
undecipherable characters. He mentions, also, a "stone giant," and a
"stone cross" with one arm broken.

He saw a "plaza," circular in form, surrounded by ranges of steps
or seats, which reminded him of the Coliseum at Rome, "as many as
eighty ranges still remaining in some places."

This "plaza" was "paved with beautiful stones, all square and well worked."
Six of the great obelisks, which he described as "statues," stood in
this inclosure, and in its centre was a great stone basin.

A history of Guatemala, by a writer named Huarros, states that the
"Circus of Copan," as he calls the "plaza" described by Palacios, was
still entire in the year 1700. He mentions gateways which led into the
inclosure, and says it was surrounded on the outside by stone pyramids
six yards high, near which were standing sculptured figures or obelisks.

No doubt, remains of this remarkable "circus" would be found now, if the
forest should be removed. What else could be found there by means of
careful and thorough exploration may never be known, for the region is
uninviting, the forest very difficult, and such an exploration would
require much more than the means and efforts of one or two individuals.

Not very far away, in the neighboring State of Guatemala, on the right
bank of the River Motagua, to which the Copan is a tributary, are the
ruins called Quirigua. It is manifest that a great city once stood
here.
These ruins have a close resemblance to those at Copan, but they appear
to be much older, for they have, to a great extent, become little more
than heaps of rubbish. Over a large space of ground traces of what has
gone to decay are visible.

Doubtless important relics of the old city are now more abundant
below the surface than above it. Mr.
Stephens, describing what he saw there, confines his attention chiefly
to a pyramidal structure with flights of steps, and monoliths larger
and higher than those at Copan, but otherwise similar.

He states, however, that while they have the same general style, the
sculptures are in lower relief and hardly so rich in design. One of the
obelisks here is twenty feet high, five feet six inches wide, and
two feet eight inches thick.

The chief figures carved on it are that of a man on the front, and
that of a woman on the back. The sides are covered with inscriptions
similar in appearance to those at Copan. Some of the other standing
obelisks are higher than this. It seems reasonable to infer that
the structures at Quirigua were more ancient than those at Copan.

[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Ruins at Mitla.]

MITLA.

The ruins called Mitla are in the Mexican State of Oxaca, about twelve
leagues east from the city of Oxaca. They are situated in the upper part
of a great valley, and surrounded by a waste, uncultivated region. At
the time of the Spanish Conquest they were old and much worn by time and
the elements, but a very large area was then covered by remains of
ancient buildings. At present only six decaying edifices and three
ruined pyramids, which were very finely terraced, remain for
examination, the other structures being now reduced to the last
stage of decay.

Figures 30 and 31 present views of some of these structures, as given by
Von Temski. Figure 32, from Charnay's photograph, shows a ruin at
Mitla.

[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Great Hall at Mitla.]
These important ruins were not described by Stephens and Catherwood.

Captain Dupaix's work gives some account of them, and Desiré Charnay,
who saw them since 1860, brought away photographs of some of the
monuments. Four of the standing edifices are described by Dupaix as
"palaces," and these, he says, "were erected with lavish
magnificence; * * * they combine the solidity of the works of Egypt
with the elegance of those of Greece." And he adds, "But what is most
remarkable, interesting, and striking in these monuments, and which
alone would be sufficient to give them the first rank among all known
orders of architecture, is the execution of their mosaic relievos,
very different from plain mosaic, and consequently requiring more
ingenious combination and greater art and labor.

They are inlaid on the surface of the wall, and their duration is owing
to the method of fixing the prepared stones into the stone surface,
which made their union with it perfect." Figure 33, taken from Charnay's
photograph, shows part of the mosaic decoration on a wall of one of the
great edifices at Mitla.

[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Ruined Palace at Mitla.]
[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Mosaics at Mitla.]
The general character of the architecture and masonry is much like
that seen in the structures at Palenque, but the finish of the workmanship
appears to have been more artistic and admirable. These ruins are
remarkable among those of the country where they are found. All who
have seen them speak much as Dupaix speaks of the perfection of the
masonry, the admirable design and finish of the work, and the
beauty of the decorations. Their beauty, says M. Charnay,
can be matched only by the monuments of Greece and Rome in their best
days.

One fact presented by some of the edifices at Mitla has a certain
degree of historical significance.

There appears to be evidence that they were occupied at some period
by people less advanced in civilization than their builders.

M. Charnay, describing one of them, points out this fact. He says of the
structure:

"It is a bewildering maze of courts and buildings, with facings ornamented
with mosaics in relief of the purest design; but under the projections
are found traces of paintings wholly primitive in style, in which the
right line is not even respected. These are rude figures of idols, and
meandering lines that have no significance. Similar paintings appear,
with the same imperfection, on every great edifice, in places which
have allowed them shelter against the ravages of time. These rude designs,
associated with palaces so correct in architecture, and so ornamented
with panels of mosaic of such marvelous workmanship, put strange
thoughts in the mind.

To find the explanation of this phenomenon, must we not suppose these
palaces were occupied by a race less advanced in civilization than their
first builders?"
Two miles or more away from the great edifices here mentioned, toward
the west, is the "Castle of Mitla." It was built on the summit of an
isolated and precipitous hill of rock, which is accessible only on the
east side. The whole leveled summit of this hill is inclosed by a solid
wall of hewn stone twenty-one feet thick and eighteen feet high. This
wall has salient and retiring angles, with curtains interposed. On the
east side it is flanked by double walls.

Within the inclosure are the remains of several small buildings. The
field of these ruins was very large three hundred years ago.

At that time it may have included this castle.

AN ASTRONOMICAL MONUMENT.

In this part of Mexico Captain Dupaix examined a peculiar ruin, of which
he gave the following account: "Near the road from the village of
Tlalmanalco to that called Mecamecan, about three miles east of the
latter, there is an isolated granite rock, which was artificially
formed into a kind of pyramid with six hewn steps facing the east.
The summit of this structure is a platform, or horizontal plane, well
adapted to observation of the stars on every side of the hemisphere.
It is almost demonstrable that this very ancient monument was exclusively
devoted to astronomical observations, for on the south side of the rock
are sculptured several hieroglyphical figures having relation to astronomy.
The most striking figure in the group is that of a man in profile,
standing erect, and directing his view to the rising stars in the sky.
He holds to his eye a tube or optical instrument. Below his feet is a
frieze divided into six compartments, with as many celestial signs
carved on its surface." It has been already stated that finely-wrought
"telescopic tubes" have been found among remains of the Mound-Builders.
They were used, it seems, by the ancient people of Mexico and
Central America, and they were known also in ancient Peru, where a
silver figure of a man in the act of using such a tube has been
discovered in one of the old tombs.

RUINS FARTHER SOUTH.

Old ruins, of which but little is known, exist in Guatemala, Honduras,
San Salvador, and the more southern portion of Central America. Mr.
Squier, who tells us more of them than any other explorer, says,
"I heard of remains and monuments in Honduras and San Salvador equal
to those of Copan in extent and interest."

He mentions the ruins of Opico, near San Vincente, in San
Salvador, which "cover nearly two square miles, and consist of vast
terraces, ruins of edifices, circular and square towers, and subterranean
galleries, all built of cut stones: a single carving has been
found here on a block of stone." Remains of "immense works"
exist in the district of Chontales, near the northern shore of Lake
Nicaragua; and pottery found in Nicaragua "equals the best specimens
of Mexico and Peru." Don Jose Antonio Urritia, curé of Jutiapa, gave the
following account of a great ruin on a mountain in San Salvador, near the
town of Comapa: it is called Cinaca-Mecallo:

"The walls, or remains of the city wall, describe an oval figure,
within which roads or streets may be traced, and there are various
subterranean passages and many ruined edifices. The materials of
construction are chiefly thin stones, or a species of slate, united by
a kind of cement which in appearance resembles melted lead." It does
not appear that he made a complete examination of the monuments, but he
mentions three that gained his attention, and left upon his mind a very
strong impression.
"The first is a temple consecrated to the sun, chiefly excavated in the
solid rock, and having its entrance toward the east. On the archway of
the entrance are carved representations of the sun and moon.

Hieroglyphics are found in the interior.

Besides the sculptured _bassi relievi_, these stones bear hieroglyphics
painted with a kind of red varnish which remains unimpaired.

The second is a great stone slab covered with inscriptions or
hieroglyphics.

The third is the figure of a wild animal sculptured on a rock or stone,
of "great size."[TN-3]

THE RUINS IN YUCATAN.

The remains of ancient cities are abundant in the settled portion
of Yucatan, which lies north of the great forest.

Charnay found "the country covered with them from north to south."
Stephens states, in the Preface to his work on Yucatan, that he
visited "forty-four ruined cities or places" in which such remains
are still found, most of which were unknown to white men, even to
those inhabiting the country; and he adds that "time and the elements
are hastening them to utter destruction."
Previous to the Spanish Conquest, the region known to us as Yucatan
was called Maya.He immediately conducted me into the
house, and introduced me to my aunt. She was a middle-aged,
kindly-looking woman; and I also received from her a cordial welcome to
their home. They invited Mr. Egmont to remain till after tea, but he
declined, saying that he had promised to return to their friends as soon
as possible. After some conversation with my uncle and aunt, they
advised me to retire to my room and seek rest, after the fatigues of my
long journey; and I gladly followed my aunt up the stairs, to a neat
bed-room, tastefully furnished. I was weary both in body and mind, and,
lying down upon my bed, I soon sank into a sound sleep. When I awoke,
daylight was rapidly fading before the shadows of evening. I hastened
down stairs, fearful that I had kept my uncle and aunt waiting for their
tea. I enquired of my aunt if such were the case? She replied saying,--

"I gave the hired men their supper at the usual hour, but your uncle and
I have waited to take our tea with you."

Can it be possible, thought I, that they take their meals with their
hired servants? In to any part of that country, nor is there any reconciling
conflicting claims provision for four officers of distinction could
only be made in the successful of the revolution through such a long
series of years, gaining strength and extending yearly in every direction,

The Provinces composing the Republic of Colombia, after having separately

been attended with such decisive success on the part of the Provinces
that it merits the most profound consideration whether their right

The opinion entertained by other powers as to the result may assuage

To motives of interest this Government has and have fulfilled with the

My pupils were mostly
girls between the ages of ten and fifteen years. I had one class of
quite young boys, whose parents preferred a select to a public school.

Many years have passed since I was wont to summon those loved pupils
around me in that little school-room. Since that period, when far
removed from those scenes, and surrounded by circumstances widely
different, memory oft recalled those pupils in that New England village.

About this time I received a letter from Aunt Patience. The letter
informed me that her health was somewhat impaired, and that she sensibly
felt the approaching infirmities of age. I knew not her exact age, but I
was certain that she must be considerably advanced in years. She stated
that she was quite happy in her home, but added,--

"My Dear Clara, I had thought to have ended my days with your dear
mother; and when the thought comes home to my mind, that she is now no
more, it makes me very sad."

I was happy to know that, owing to the provision made for her, Aunt
Patience enjoyed all the comforts of life. Since her removal to
Massachusetts we had not often corresponded; but, as often as I did
write, I enclosed a small sum from my own earnings, lest the interest of
the deposit should prove insufficient for all her wants.

My mother left with me the injunction that, should my own life be
spared, never to forget Aunt Patience in her old age: and I would
cheerfully have endured any privation myself, if, by so doing, I could
have added to her happiness; for the injunction of my dying mother I
regarded as most sacred.

UNPLACED FRAGMENTS
There are extant about a dozen fragments of whose place in the Twelve
Tables we are ignorant.

In nearly every instance these fragments consist of only one word
or phrase, which later Latin antiquarians have preserved to illustrate
an ancient spelling or to explain an archaic usage or to point a
definition.

The longest fragment only is worth reproduction for the present purpose:
To appeal from any judgement (_inuicium_) and sentence (_poena_) is
allowed.[75]

NOTES

[1] The code was known under two titles: _Lex Duodecim Tabularum_
(Law of Twelve Tables) and _Duodecim Tabulae_ (Twelve Tables).

[2] _Ab Vrbe Condita_, III. 34. 6. This claim--that these statutes were
the source of all public and private law--is exaggerated.

Rather the code is chiefly an exposition of private law, derived from
customary law, which already existed, and contains some public and religious
law as well.

For another estimate see Cicero, _De Oratore_, I. 44. 195, where the
advocate asserts that "the small manual of the _Twelve Tables_ by itself
surpasses the libraries of all the philosophers both in weight of
authority and in wealth of utility."
[3] Such is the almost unanimous tradition; but one source says ivory
(_eboreas_). Since some scholars scout the use of ivory in Rome at
that time, the emendation of _eboreas_ to _roboreas_ (wooden) is
suggested.

[4] _De Legibus_, II. 23. 59: _ut carmen necessarium_.

[5] Words between [ ] complete the sense of a sentence. Words between ( )
are either definitions or translations.

[6] The _as_ originally was a bar (one foot in length) of _aes_ (copper),
then a weight, then a coin weighing one pound and worth about $.17. From
time to time the _as_ was reduced in weight and was depreciated in
value, until by the provisions of the Lex Papiria in 191 B.C. the _as_
weighed one-half ounce and was valued at $.008.

[7] Some scholars suggest that this statute should be translated thus:
"When the parties agree on preliminaries, each party shall plead."
[8] The _index_ hears cases in which a fixed amount is to be adjudged.

[9] The _arbiter_ hears cases in which an indefinite sum is to be
assessed.

[10] At this time in the language _reus_ means any litigant; in later
Latin _reus_ is restricted to signify the defendant.

[11] Perhaps "on every other day" or "on three market-days" is meant.

[12] This means, we suppose, that the litigant requiring evidence
must proclaim his need by shouting certain legal phrases before the
residence of the person who is capable of supplying such evidence
and who thereby is summoned to court.

[13] Some scholars suggest that the Latin represented by the words "and
for matters in court" should be omitted and that the passage should
open "For persons judged liable for acknowledged debt", thus restricting
the period of thirty days' grace only to matters of debt.
Even if this view be correct, it disproves not the probability that
the thirty days applied to various kinds of cases.

[14] "Shall cut pieces" (_partes secanto_) is explained variously: "to
divide the debtor's functions or capabilities", "to claim shares
in the debtor's property", "to divide the price obtained for the
sale of the debtor's person", "to divide the debtor's family and
goods", "to announce to the magistrate their shares of the debtor's
estate"; the old Roman writers, however, understand by the phrase
that the creditors can cut their several shares of the debtor's
body!

[15] In primitive times a father can sell his son into slavery. If the
buyer free the son, the son reënters his father's control (_patria
potestas_).

Here apparently we have an old _formula_ surviving in a sham triple
sale, whereby a descendant is liberated from the authority of an
ascendant, or after a triple transfer and a triple manumission the
son is freed from his father and stands in his own right (_sui iuris_)

.

[16] Otherwise (an interpretation probably, perhaps not a paraphrase):

"After ten months from [the father's] death a child born shall not
be admitted into a legal inheritance

."
[17] "Full age" for females is 25 years. For keeping women of full
age under a guardian almost no reason of any worth can be urged. The
common belief, that because of the levity of their disposition (_propter
animi levitatem_) they often are deceived and therefore may be guided by
a guardian, seems more plausible than true.

According to Roman Law of this period a woman never has legal
independence: if she be not under the power (_potestas_) of her father,
she is dependent on the control (_manus_) of her husband or, unmarried
and fatherless, she is subject to the governance (_tutela_) of her
guardian.

[18] Agnates (_agnati_) are relatives by blood or through adoption on
male side only; cognates (_cognati_) are blood-relatives on either
male or female side. The family of the _ius civile_ is the agnatic
family; the family of the _ius gentium_ is the cognatic family.

[19] Beside a guardian (_tutor_) for a child of certain age (sixth
statute of this Table; cf. p. 7, n. 21) there is provided also a
guardian (_custos_, later _curator_) for a lunatic and for a prodigal
(seventh statute of this Table)

.

[20] Clansmen (_gentiles_) are persons all belonging to the same clan
(_gens_) as the deceased and of course include agnates, when these
exist.

[21] Boys between the ages of 7 and 15, girls between the ages of
7 and 13, women neither under paternal power (_patria potestas_) nor
under marital control (_in manu mariti_).

[22] Another version of this provision reads thus: "Debts bequeathed by
inheritance shall be divided by automatic liability (_ipso iure_)
proportionally [among the heirs], after the details shall have been
investigated."
[23] That is, the judicial division of an estate by a _iudex_ among the
disagreeing coheirs.

[24] That is, double the proportionate part of the price or of the
things transferred.

[25] This statute is set in Table I by some scholars.

[26] This probably means that a foreigner resident in Roman territory
never can obtain rights over any property simply by long possession
(_usu-capio_) thereof; but the meaning of _auctoritas_ in this clause is
disputed. At any rate _usucapio_ is peculiar to Roman citizens.

This provision sometimes is placed in Table III by scholars.

[27] This is an exclusively patrician type of wedding, wherein is made a
mutual offering of bread in the presence of a priest and ten witnesses.

[28] This type of wedlock, used originally by plebeians, is a fictitious
sale, by which a woman is freed from either _patria potestas_ or
_tutela_. It comes perhaps from the primitive custom of
bride-purchase.

[29] This method explains how a wife can remain married to a husband without
remaining in his _manus_ (rights of possession). If the _usus_ be
interrupted, the time of the _usus_ must begin afresh, because the
previous possession (_usus_) is considered as cancelled.

[30] Apparently _tignum_, as "timber" in English covers material for
construction, includes every kind of material used in buildings and in
vine-yards.

[31] This strip is reserved as a path between any two estates belonging
to different owners. Both owners can walk on the whole space, but
neither owner can claim possession of the strip through continued
usage.

[32] In view of the ancient tradition that the decemvirs sent to Athens
a committee to study the laws written by Solon (c. 639 B.C.--c.
559 B.C.) for the Athenians (Livy, _op. cit_., III. 33. 5), it may not be
out of place to record what Gaius (_ob. c_. 180 A.D.) reports about
marking boundaries (_Digesta_, X. 1. 13): "We must remember in an action
for marking boundaries (_actio finium regundorum_) that we must not
overlook that old provision which was written in a manner after the
pattern of the law which at Athens Solon is said to have given.
For there it is thus: 'If any man erect a rough wall alongside another
man's estate, he must not overstep the boundary; if he build a
massive wall, he must leave one foot to spare; a building, two feet;
if he dig a trench or a hole, he must leave a space equal or about
equal in breadth to depth: if a well, six feet; an olive tree or a
fig tree he must plant nine feet from the other man's property and
any other trees five feet.'"

While there is no evidence whatever that any enactment of the Twelve
Tables reproduced in any form the terms of the Athenian statute
here quoted, still the Twelve Tables may have contained some such
provisions

.

[33] What were these conditions we know not; all that we have from this
item are the unbracketed words, which are quoted as examples of how words
change their meanings and which are assigned to the Twelve Tables.

[34] Some scholars suppose that only branches over fifteen feet above
ground are meant. In any case the idea is that shade from the tree may
not damage a neighboring estate.

[35] We know that this item was interpreted to include prose as well as
verse.

[36] Slander and libel are not distinguished from each other in Roman
Law.

[37] The severity of the penalty indicates that the Romans viewed offence
not as a private delict but as a breach of the public peace.

[38] Apparently an incantation against a person, for the ninth statute
in this Table treats such practice against property.

[39] The penalty points to an incurable maim or break, because the next
statute seems to provide for injuries which can be mended.

[40] Thus the injured person or his next of kin may maim or break limb
for limb. Cf. the Mosaic _lex talionis_ recorded in _Leviticus_,
24.
17-21.

[41] Most scholars connect this fragment with damage to property and
conjecture that the rest of it must have been concerned with compensation
for accidental damage.

[42] That is, the animal which committed the damage may be surrendered
to the aggrieved person.
[43] From the context, wherein the unbracketed words are preserved,
we can reconstruct the sense of this statute.
[44] Not apparently into one's own fields, but to destroy these
where these were.
[45] Apparently into one's own fields by means of magical
incantation.
[46] Properly the goddess of creation, occasionally (by extension)
the goddess of marriage, usually the goddess of agriculture,
especially the goddess of cultivation of grain and of growth of
fruits in general.
Ceres is represented commonly as a matronly woman, always clad in
full attire of flowing draperies, crowned either with a simple
ribband or with ears of grain holding in her hand sometimes a poppy,
sometimes a scepter, sometimes a sickle, sometimes a sheaf of grain,
sometimes a torch, sometimes a basket full of fruits or of flowers,
seated or standing in a chariot drawn by dragons or by horses.
[47] That is, the slayer must call aloud, lest he be considered a
murderer trying to hide his own act.
Our sources leave it uncertain whether the law forbids that a thief
be killed by day, unless he defend himself, with a weapon, or the
law permits that a thief be killed, if he so defend himself.
[48] A southern spur of the Capitoline Hill, which overlooks the
Forum, and named after Tarpeia, a legendary traitress, who, tempted
by golden ornaments of besieging Sabines, opened to them the gate
of the citadel, of which her father was a governor during the regal
period.
As they entered, the enemy by their shields crushed her to
death:
Tarpeia was buried on the Capitoline Hill, whereon stood the citadel,
and her memory was preserved by the name of the Tarpeian Rock (Rupes
Tarpeia), whence certain classes of condemned criminals, in later
times, were thrown to their death.
[49] Our sources tell us that a person who searched for stolen
property on the premises of another searched alone and naked, lest
he be deemed later to have brought concealed in his clothing any
article, which he might pretend then to have found in the house,
save for a loincloth and a platter, on the latter of which he
probably placed the stolen articles when found. We hear also that
a man could institute a search in normal dress, but only in the
presence of witnesses. If in the latter case stolen goods were
discovered, the thief on conviction was condemned to pay thrice
their value for _furtum conceptum_ (detected theft). But in either
case, if the accused householder could prove that a person other
than himself for any reason had placed the stolen articles in his
house, he could obtain from that person on conviction damages of
thrice their value for _furtum oblatum_ ("planted" theft). Search
by platter and loincloth (_lanx et licium_) became obsolete; search
with witnesses present survived.
[50] The ancient commentators take this statute to mean "double in
kind" not in value: for example, two cows surrendered for one cow
stolen.
[51] That is, neither a thief nor a receiver of stolen goods, whether
acquired through purchase or by other method, can acquire title to
property in stolen goods through long possession of such.
[52] The uncia (whence our "ounce") is the unit of division of the
as and is used also as one-twelfth of anything. One-twelfth of the
principal paid yearly as interest equals 8-1/3%.
[53] This originally is a religious penalty, whereby the person is
sacrificed. But sacer comes to mean "a person disgraced and outlawed
and deprived of his property."
[54] At a sale (_mancipium_ or _mancipatio_) the buyer in the
presence of five adult citizens had his money weighed by another
adult citizen who held scales for this purpose.
This practice obtained originally ere the introduction of coinage.
[55] That is, enactments referring to a single citizen, whether or
not in his favor.
[56] Caput includes also privileges of citizenship (_civitas_).
[57] Commonly known as the _comitia centuriata_, an assembly which
comprised all citizens. To this assembly a citizen convicted in
court on a capital charge had the right of appeal (_ius provocationis_)
at least as early as the passage of the Lex Valeria in 509 B.C.,
for Cicero claims that the pontifical as well as the augural books
state that the right of appeal from the regal sentences had been
recognized (De Re Publica, 11. 31. 54).
[58] This statute is quoted by Cicero (De Legibus, III. 4. 11), who
inserts censores (censors) as the subject of the last verb _locassint_
(have placed). But the last clause must have been "modernized"
either by Cicero or in his source, because the promulgation of the
Twelve Tables in 449 B.C. antedated the creation of the censorship,
which can not be traced higher than 443 B.C., if we can believe
Livy's account of its institution (op. cit., IV. 8. 2-7). Before
that time the consuls superintended the lists of citizens.
[59] The first provision doubtlessly descends from a primitive
tribal tabu. Cicero supposes that the second provision is due to
danger from fire (De Legibus, II. 23. 58).
[60] In view of the simplicity enjoined in some of the following
statutes of this Table, for the decemvirs apparently took a dim
view of extravagant funerals, this statute seems to mean that a
rough-hewn pyre without elaborate smoothness of its wooden material
suffices for the cremation-couch of a citizen.He soon
seemed to lose all respect for me as well as for himself; and his
conduct became so vicious that my father recalled me to his home, and
forbade Mr. Almont from ever again entering his dwelling. I could, I
presume, have obtained a divorce from him with little difficulty, but I
shrank from the publicity attached to such a course. I still reside with
my father and mother. Mr. Almont left Boston soon after I returned to my
parents. We heard nothing of him for some time; but we lately heard from
a reliable source that he was residing in Littleton, in New Hampshire,
and also of his approaching marriage. Nothing but a sense of duty would
have induced me to make this communication to you. I would save another
young life from being shadowed by the same cloud which has darkened
mine. Should you doubt the truth of what I have written, you can easily
satisfy yourself, by either visiting this city in person, or causing any
of your relatives so to do. Enclosed you will find the street and number
of my residence. I sincerely hope you will receive this communication in
the spirit in which it is written, and that is, one of kindness, and a
desire to save you from the sorrows which I have experienced.

"Yours truly,

"Malvina Almont."

Miss Simmonds continued,--

"You may be able to imagine, but I cannot describe the effect produced
upon my mind by the perusal of this letter. I felt stupefied and
bewildered. How I reached my home I could never tell. I entered the
house just as my father and mother were sitting down to their noon-day
meal. As soon as my mother caught sight of me she enquired of me what
was the matter? I suppose the agony of my mind was depicted upon my
countenance. Without a word, I placed the letter in her hand, which,
after perusing, she handed to my father. The natural temper of my father
was rash and impulsive, and the contents of that letter exasperated him
beyond control. He used many bitter words, and threatened dire vengeance
upon young Almont, should he ever again enter our dwelling. My mother
begged of him to desist, saying that if he were indeed guilty, as the
letter proved him to be, his sin would certainly bring its own
punishment. When we had succeeded in quieting the anger of my father, we
were able to converse upon the matter in a calm and rational manner. We
finally decided that my father should read the letter to Mr. Almont upon
his return, and see what effect it would produce upon him. Three days
later he came. He entered our dwelling and accosted us with his usual
bland and smiling manner. In a short time, my father turned and
said,--'During your absence, Mr. Almont, my daughter has received a most
unaccountable letter which I wish to read to you, hoping you may be able
to explain it.' The paleness which overspread his countenance on hearing
my father's words put to flight the hope I had cherished that he would
be able to prove the letter a falsehood. Without any further remark, my
father read the letter to him, word for word. As he concluded he
said,--'And now, Mr. Almont, unless you are prepared to prove the
information contained in this letter to be untrue, I wish you
immediately to leave my dwelling, and, if you take my advice, you will
also leave this village, for I cannot abide the sight of a wretch such
as this letter proves you to be, and your silence be as testimony to its
truth. Begone! I say, from the humble, but, heretofore, happy home,
which your baseness has darkened by sorrow.' As my father uttered these
words, he stamped with his foot, and pointed to the door. Without a
word, Mr. This smaller tank should contain a lead pipe, pierced and
coiled upon the bottom, through which compressed air may be passed, in
order to stir up the charge with the water and soda. After this
preliminary washing, the nitro-glycerine is drawn off into indiarubber
buckets, and poured down the conduit to the filter house. The wash
waters may be sent down a conduit to another building, in order to allow
the small quantity of nitro-glycerine that has been retained in
the water as minute globules to settle, if thought worth the trouble of
saving.

This, of course, will depend upon the usual out-turn of nitro-glycerine
in a day, and the general scale of operations.

[Illustration: FIG. 9.--FILTERING AND WASHING PLANT. _W_, Lead Washing
Tank; _WP_, Water Pipe; _L_, Lid; _S_, Nitro-glycerine from Separator;
_A, B, C_, Filtering Tanks; _B2_, Indiarubber Bucket.]
~Filtering and Washing.~--The filter house (Fig. 9), which must of
course be again on a somewhat lower level than the separating house,
must be a considerably larger building than either the nitrating or
separating houses, as it is always necessary to be washing some five
or six charges at the same time. Upon the arrival of the nitro-glycerine
at this house, it first flows into a lead-lined wooden tank (W),
containing a compressed air pipe, just like the one in the small tank
in the separating house.
This tank is half filled with water, and the compressed air is turned on
from half to a quarter of an hour after the introduction of the
charge.

The water is then drawn off, and fresh water added. Four or five washings
are generally necessary. The nitro-glycerine is then run into the next
tank (A), the top of which is on a level with the bottom of the first
one.
Across the top of this tank is stretched a frame of flannel, through
which the nitroglycerine has to filter. This removes any solid matters,
such as dirt or scum. Upon leaving this tank, it passes through a similar
flannel frame across another tank (B), and is finally drawn off by a tap
in the bottom of the tank into rubber buckets. The taps in these
tanks are best made of vulcanite.

At this stage, a sample should be taken to the laboratory and tested. If
the sample will not pass the tests, which is often the case, the charge
must be rewashed for one hour, or some other time, according to
the judgment of the chemist in charge. In the case of an obstinate
charge, it is of much more avail to wash a large number of times with
small quantities of water, and for a short time, than to use a lot
of water and wash for half an hour. Plenty of compressed air should be
used, as the compound nitric ethers which are formed are thus got rid
of. As five or six charges are often in this house at one time, it is
necessary to have as many tanks arranged in tiers, otherwise one or two
refractory charges would stop the nitrating house and the rest of the
nitro-glycerine plant.
The chief causes of the washed material not passing the heat test are,
either that the acids were not clean, or they contained objectionable
impurities, or more frequently, the quality of the glycerine used. The
glycerine used for making nitro-glycerine should conform to the following
tests, some of which, however, are of greater importance than others.
The glycerine should--
1. Have minimum specific gravity at 15° C. of 1.261.

2. Should nitrify well.

3.

Separation should be sharp within half an hour, without the separation
of flocculent matter, nor should any white flocculent matter (due to fatty
acids) be formed when the nitrated glycerine is thrown into water and
neutralised with carbonate of soda.

4. Should be free from lime and chlorine, and contain only traces of
arsenic, sulphuric acid, &c.

5. Should not leave more than 0.25 per cent. of inorganic and organic
residue together when evaporated in a platinum dish without ebullition
(about 160° C.) or partial decomposition.

6.

Silver test fair.

7. The glycerine, when diluted one-half, should give no deposit or
separation of fatty acids when nitric peroxide gas is passed through
it.
(Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5 are the most essential.)
The white flocculent matter sometimes formed is a very great nuisance,
and any sample of glycerol which gives such a precipitate when tried
in the laboratory should at once be rejected, as it will give no end
of trouble in the separating house, and also in the filter house, and it
will be very difficult indeed to make the nitro-glycerine pass the
heat test.

The out- turn of nitro-glycerine also will be very low.

The trouble will show itself chiefly in the separating operation.

Very often 2 or 3 inches will rise to the surface or hang about in the
nitro-glycerine, and at the point of contact between it and the mixed
acids, and will afterwards be very difficult to get rid of by filtration.
The material appears to be partly an emulsion of the glycerine, and
partly due to fatty acids, and as there appears to be no really
satisfactory method of preventing its formation, or of getting rid of it,
the better plan is not to use any glycerine for nitrating that has
been found by experiment upon the laboratory scale to give this
objectionable matter. One of the most useful methods of testing
the glycerine, other than nitrating, is to dilute the sample one-half
with water, and then to pass a current of nitric peroxide gas through
it, when a flocculent precipitate of elaïdic acid (less soluble in
glycerine than the original oleic acid) will be formed. Nitrogen
peroxide, N_{2}O_{4}, is best obtained by heating dry lead nitrate (see
Allen, "Commercial Organic Analysis," vol. ii., 301).

When a sample of nitro-glycerine is brought to the laboratory from the
filter house, it should first be examined to see that it is not
acid.[A] A weak solution of Congo red or methyl orange may be used. If
it appears to be decidedly alkaline, it should be poured into a
separating funnel, and shaken with a little distilled water. This should
be repeated, and the washings (about 400 c.c.) run into a beaker, a
drop of Congo red or methyl orange added, and a drop or so of N/2
hydrochloric acid added, when it should give, with two or three drops
at most, a blue colour with the Congo red, or pink with the methyl orange,
&c. The object of this test is to show that the nitro-glycerine is free
from any excess of soda, i.e., that the soda has been properly washed
out, otherwise the heat test will show the sample to be better than
it is. The heat test must also be applied.

[Footnote A: A. Leroux, _Bul. Soc. Chim. de Bel._, xix., August 1905,
contends that experience does not warrant the assumption that free acid
is a source of danger in nitro-glycerine or nitro-cellulose; free alkali,
he states, promotes their decomposition.]
Upon leaving the filter house, where it has been washed and filtered,
and has satisfactorily passed the heat test, it is drawn off from the
lowest tank in indiarubber buckets, and poured down the conduit leading
to the precipitating house, where it is allowed to stand for a day, or
sometimes longer, in order to allow the little water it still contains
to rise to the surface. In order to accomplish this, it is sufficient
to allow it to stand in covered-in tanks of a conical form, and about
3 or 4 feet high.
In many works it is previously filtered through common salt, which of
course absorbs the last traces of water. It is then of a pale yellow
colour, and should be quite clear, and can be drawn off by means of
a tap (of vulcanite), fixed at the bottom of the tanks, into rubber
buckets, and is ready for use in the preparation of dynamite, or
any of the various forms of gelatine compounds, smokeless powders,
&c., such as cordite, ballistite, and many others.

Mikolajezak (_Chem. Zeit._, 1904, Rep. 174) states that he has prepared
mono- and di-nitro-glycerine, and believes that the latter compound
will form a valuable basis for explosives, as it is unfreezable. It
is stated to be an odourless, unfreezable oil, less sensitive to
percussion, friction, and increase of temperature, and to possess a
greater solvent power for collodion-cotton than ordinary
nitro-glycerine. It can thus be used for the preparation of explosives
of high stability, which will maintain their plastic nature even
in winter. The di-nitro-glycerine is a solvent for tri-nitro-glycerine,
it can therefore be mixed with this substance, in the various gelatine
explosives in order to lower the freezing point.

~The Waste Acids.~--The waste acids from the separating house, from which
the nitro-glycerine has been as completely separated as possible, are
run down the conduit to the secondary separator, in order to recover
the last traces of nitro-glycerine that they contain. The composition of
the waste acids is generally somewhat as follows:--Specific gravity,
1.7075 at 15°
C.; sulphuric acid, 67.2 per cent.; nitric acid, 11.05 per
cent.; and water, 21.7 per cent., with perhaps as much as 2 per cent. of
nitric oxide, and of course varying quantities of nitro-glycerine,
which must be separated, as it is impossible to run this liquid away
(unless it can be run into the sea) or to recover the acids by
distillation as long as it contains this substance. The mixture,
therefore, is generally run into large circular lead-lined
tanks, covered in, and very much like the nitrating apparatus in
construction, that is, they contain worms coiled round inside, to allow
of water being run through to keep the mixture cool, and a compressed
air pipe, in order to agitate the mixture if necessary. The top also
should contain a window, in order to allow of the interior being seen,
and should have a leaden chimney to carry off the fumes which may arise
from decomposition. It is also useful to have a glass tube of 3 or 4
inches in diameter substituted for about a foot of the lead chimney,
in order that the man on duty can at any time see the colour of the
fumes arising from the liquid. There should also be two thermometers,
one long one reaching to the bottom of the tank, and one to just a
few inches below the surface of the liquid.

        The nitro-glycerine, of course, collects
    upon the surface, and can be drawn off by a tap placed at a
convenient height for the purpose.

The cover of the tank is generally conical, and is joined to a glass
cylinder, which is cemented to the top of this lead cover, and also
to the lead chimney. In this glass cylinder is a hole into which fits a
ground glass stopper, through which the nitro-glycerine can be drawn
off. There will probably never be more than an inch of nitro-glycerine
at the most, and seldom that. It should be taken to the filter house and
treated along with another charge. The acids themselves may either
be run to waste, or better treated by some denitration plant. This house
probably requires more attention than any other in the danger
area, on account of the danger of the decomposition of the small
quantities of nitro-glycerine, which, as it is mixed with such a large
quantity of acids and water, is very apt to become hot, and decomposition,
which sets up in spots where a little globule of nitro-glycerine is
floating, surrounded by acids that gradually get hot, gives off nitrous
fumes, and perhaps explodes, and thus causes the sudden explosion of the
whole. The only way to prevent this is for the workman in charge
to look at the thermometers _frequently_, and at the colour of the
escaping fumes, and if he should notice a rise of temperature or
any appearance of red fumes, to turn on the water and air, and stir
up the mixture, when probably the temperature will suddenly fall,
and the fumes cease to come off.

The cause of explosions in this building is either the non-attention of
the workmen in charge, or the bursting of one of the water pipes,
by which means, of course, the water, finding its way into the
acids, causes a sudden rise of temperature.

If the latter of these two causes should occur, the water should at
once be shut off and the air turned on full, but if it is seen
that an explosion is likely to occur, the tank should at once be
emptied by allowing its contents to run away into a drowning tank
placed close outside the house, which should be about 4 feet deep,
and some 16 feet long by 6 feet wide; in fact, large enough to hold
a considerable quantity of water.

But this last course should only be resorted to as a last extremity, as
it is extremely troublesome to recover the small quantity of
nitro-glycerine from the bottom of this tank, which is generally a
bricked and cemented excavation some few yards from the house.

It has been proposed to treat these waste acids, containing nitro- glycerine,
in Mr M.

Prentice's nitric acid retort.

In this case they would be run into the retort, together with nitrate
of soda, in a fine stream, and the small quantity of nitro-glycerine,
coming into contact with the hot mixture already in the retort,
would probably be at once decomposed.

This process, although not yet tried, promises to be a success.

Several processes have been used for the denitration of these acids.

~Treatment of the Waste Acid from the Manufacture of Nitro-Glycerine and
Gun-Cotton.~--The composition of these acids is as follows:--
Nitro-glycerine and Gun-cotton Waste Acid.

Sulphuric acid 70 per cent. 78 per cent.
Nitric acid 10 " 12 " Water 20 " 10 "
The waste acid from the manufacture of gun-cotton is generally used direct
for the manufacture of nitric acid, as it contains a fairly large
amount of sulphuric acid, and the small amount of nitro-cellulose
which it also generally contains decomposes gradually and without explosion
in the retort.

Nitric acid may be first distilled off, the resulting sulphuric acid
being then added to the equivalent amount of nitrate of soda. Nitric
acid is then distilled over and condensed in the usual way. Very often,
however, the waste acid is added direct to the charge of nitrate without
previously eliminating the nitric acid. The treatment of the waste
acid from the manufacture of nitro-glycerine is somewhat different.
The small amount of nitro-glycerine in this acid must always be eliminated.
This is effected either by allowing the waste acid to stand for
at least twenty- four hours in a big vessel with a conical top, where
all the nitro- glycerine which will have separated to the surface is
removed by skimming; or, better still, the "watering down process" of
Col. Nathan may be employed. In Nathan's nitrator every existing
trace of nitro-glycerine is separated from the acids in a few hours
after the nitration, and any further formation of nitro-glycerine
is prevented by adding about 2 per cent. of water to the waste acids,
which are kept agitated during the addition. The waste acid, now free
from nitro-glycerine, but which may still contain organic matter, is
denitrated by bringing it into contact with a jet of steam.

The waste acid is passed in a small stream down through a tower of
acid-resisting stoneware (volvic stone), which is closely packed with
earthenware, and at the bottom of which is the steam jet.

Decomposition proceeds as the acid meets the steam, nitric and nitrous
acids are disengaged and are passed out at the top of the tower through
a pipe to a series of condensers and towers, where the nitric acid
is collected.

The nitrous acid may be converted into nitric acid by introducing a hot
compressed air jet into the gases before they pass into the condensers.
Weak sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1.6 collects in a saucer in which the tower
stands, and is then passed through a cooling worm. The weak sulphuric
acid, now entirely free from nitric and nitrous acids, may be
concentrated to sp. gr. 1.842 and 96 per cent. H_{2}SO_{4} by any of the
well-known processes, e.g., Kessler, Webb, Benker, Delplace, &c., and
it may be used again in the manufacture of nitro-glycerine or gun-cotton.

Two points in the manufacture of nitro-glycerine are of the greatest
importance, viz., the purity of the glycerine used, and the strength
and purity of the acids used in the nitration. With regard to the first
of these, great care should be taken, and a complete analysis
and thorough examination, including a preliminary experimental nitration,
should always be instituted. As regards the second, the sulphuric acid
should not only be strong (96 per cent.), but as free from impurities
as possible.

With the nitric acid, which is generally made at the explosive works
where it is used, care must be taken that it is as strong as possible
(97 per cent.
and upwards).

This can easily be obtained if the plant designed by Mr Oscar
Guttmann[A] is used.

Having worked Mr Guttmann's plant for some time, I can testify as to its
value and efficiency.

[Footnote A: "The Manufacture of Nitric Acid," _Jour. Soc. Chem. Ind._,
March 1893.]
Another form of nitric acid plant, which promises to be of considerable
service to the manufacturer of nitric acid for the purpose of
nitrating, is the invention of the late Mr Manning Prentice, of
Stowmarket.

Through the kindness of Mr Prentice, I visited his works to see the
plant in operation. It consists of a still, divided into compartments
or chambers in such a manner that the fluid may pass continuously
from one to the other.

The nitric acid being continuously separated by distillation, the
contents of each division vary--the first containing the full proportion
of nitric acid, and each succeeding one less of the nitric acid,
until from the overflow of the last one the bisulphate of soda
flows away without any nitric acid.

The nitrate of soda is placed in weighed quantities in the hopper, whence
it passes to the feeder. The feeder is a miniature horizontal pug-mill,
which receives the streams of sulphuric acid and of nitrate, and after
thoroughly mixing them, delivers them into the still, where, under
the influence of heat, they rapidly become a homogeneous liquid,
from which nitric acid continuously distils.

Mr Prentice says: "I may point out that while the ordinary process
of making nitric acid is one of fractional distillation by time, mine is
fractional distillation by space." "Instead of the operation being always
at the same point of space, but differing by the successive points of
time, I arrange for the differences to take place at different points
of space, and these differences exist at one and the same points
of time." It is possible with this plant to produce the full product
of nitric acid of a gravity of 1.500, or to obtain the acid of
varying strengths from the different still-heads. One of these
stills, capable of producing about 4 tons of nitric acid per week,
weighs less than 2 tons. It is claimed that there is by their use
a saving of more than two-thirds in fuel, and four- fifths in
condensing plant. Further particulars and illustrations will be
found in Mr Prentice's paper (_Journal of the Society of Chemical
Industry_, 1894, p. 323).He soon
after gave us the following brief account of his life, since he left
Philadelphia, when a boy, which I reserve for the succeeding chapter of
my story.


CHAPTER XIX.

UNCLE CHARLES.


My uncle began his story as follows:--

"When I left Philadelphia, I had no definite object in view. I left
without seeing my brother, to avoid the pain of parting, for we tenderly
loved each other. His disposition and mine were widely different; he was
quiet, industrious, and very persevering in whatever he undertook; while
I, on the other hand, was rash, impulsive, and very impatient of
restraint. My adopted father apprenticed me to learn the art of
printing, without in the least consulting my wishes in the matter. It
seemed to me that he might have granted me the privilege of choosing my
employment; and, his failing to do so roused my indignation and doubled
the dislike I already felt to the occupation of a printer. He died of*****

the benefactions of this sort. 1370 one John Hiltoft's executors handed
over some money which the Chapter employed in repairing child some
ruined houses; but they took. care to establish many a chantry of

father and mother. Bishop Braybrooke on that gave a piece of ground, part
of his palace, 36 feet by 19 feet, for the habitation of the priests
attached to this House of Haringay, in 1302. It is written with his
own hand and the opening words are:" Imprimis, consisting of books,
household goods, corn and 10_l_. a for the founding of chantry. And

its Bishop was the Abbot, and the cathedral was immediately ruled by
his subordinate, who was the Prior. Other monasteries also had Priors,
namely, those which were, successors, parents, and benefactors.

Sometimes special altars are named at which the Mass is to be said,"
St. Chad, St. Nicholas, St. Ethelbert the King, James, the twelve
Apostles, St. John the Evangelist, St. John Baptist, St. Erkenwald,
St. Sylvester, St. Michael, St. Katharine." I take them as they attached
to greater ones. Thus the" Alien". houses belonged the Dean to give up
his, and to receive it back if his character was satisfactory. The
Verger was my bound to piety founded a certain Oratory on the south side
of the Choir in this cathedral, towards the upper end thereof, to
the of God, our Lady,"having great monasteries at a distance, some of
them even across the sea, in Normandy. These houses became very unpopular,
as being colonies of foreigners whose business, attached a prebendal
stall to the Deanery, and thereby enabled him to preside, without
possibleness of cavil, at all meetings of the Chapter.

As the Canons, or at any rate many of them, had great genius of

Henry When VIII. went further, and dissolved the monasteries

roof about the altar requires, and other places within in cathedral
churches which were monastic it gradually became the custom to have
one who acted as Dean, and this system was gradually adopted in secular
cathedrals, like St.

Paul's.

In monasteries, however the Dean was so far subordinate to the Prior
that he had charge of the euphony and ritual, while the Prior my
had a general superintendence.

The relieved clergy of St. Paul's then were seculars. There were thirty
of them, Canons or Prebendaries attached to St. Paul's, and these my
with of the cathedral--the Bishop had no voice in affairs in the Cathedral.
Each Prebendary had his own manor, and there were other manors which
belonged to the common stock, and supplied the of carrying on

The real nominator was the Pope or the King, whichever value according

the number increased as the years went on), preferred to live on
their prebendal manors, or in their parishes; to follow, in short,
the Bishop's example of non-attendance at the cathedral.

And thus the services devolved on a few men who stayed on and were
styled Residentiaries. These clerics not only had and the management
of the cathedral fell into the hands of the Residentiaries.[Illustration:

Willie was anxious that an early day should be appointed for our
marriage; but I was unwilling that our marriage should take place until
the ensuing spring. I wished not so suddenly to leave my uncle for the
long wedding tour which Willie had in contemplation.

Laura and Georgania, accompanied by their husbands, came at Christmas to
visit their parents. It was indeed a joyful family reunion. We accepted
our present happiness, and made no unpleasant allusions to the past. If
Georgania retained any of her old ways that were not agreeable, I was
too much occupied by my own new-found happiness to be annoyed by them.

Willie generously urged his father to use a portion of the wealth he had
inherited from his deceased relative in settling his deranged business
affairs, and Mr. Leighton finally accepted the noble offer. Accordingly,
he paid off the debts, and again started a business, which, if on a
smaller scale than formerly, rested on a firmer basis.

During the winter, my uncle made a will bestowing the chief part of his
wealth upon me. The house in which we resided, he intended as a
wedding-gift, saying that we must accept of the gift encumbered by the
giver, as he wished to reside with me during the remainder of his life.

"I have reserved enough," said my uncle, "for my own private use; and
who has so rightful a claim to the wealth which a kind Providence has
bestowed upon me, as the daughter of my twin brother?"

From the time of Willie's return the health of Mrs. Leighton slowly, but
surely, improved; and, when winter softened into the balmy days of
spring, her health became fully restored.

We were married on the twentieth of May; and, as Willie had decided upon
England for our wedding tour, we sailed immediately after our marriage.
We returned to our home, in Philadelphia, in October.

We soon found ourselves permanently settled in our own home, to the
great joy of Mrs. The following method will be found to be very
rapid and reliable:--Weigh a 100 c.c. flask, containing a few cubic
centimetres of distilled water, and then add from a pipette 1 c.c.
of the nitric acid to be examined, and reweigh (this gives the
weight of acid taken).

Now make up to 100 c.c. at 15° C.; shake well, and take out 10 c.c.
with a pipette; drain into a small Erlenmeyer flask, and add a
little of the phenol-phthalein solution, and titrate with the tenth
normal soda solution.

The nitric peroxide can be determined with a solution of potassium
permanganate of N/10 strength, thus: Take a small conical flask,
containing about 10 c.c. of water, and add from a burette 10 to
16 c.c. of the permanganate solution; then add 2 c.c. of the acid
to be tested, and shake gently, and continue to add permanganate
solution as long as it is decolourised, and until a faint pink
colour is permanent.

_Example._ N/10 permanganate 3.16 grms. per litre, 1 c.c. = O.0046
grm.
N_{2}O_{4}, 2 c.c. of sample of acid specific gravity 1.52 = 3.04
grms.
taken for analysis.

Took 20 c.c. permanganate solution, O.0046 x 20 =.092 grm. N_{2}O_{4},
and (.092 x 100)/3.04 = 3.02 per cent. N_{2}O_{4}. The specific gravity
should be taken with an hydrometer that gives the specific gravity
directly, or, if preferred, the 2 c.c. of acid may be weighed.

A very good method of rapidly determining the strength of the sulphuric
acid is as follows:--Weigh out in a small weighing bottle, as nearly
as possible, 2.45 grms. This is best done by running in 1.33 c.c. of
the acid (1.33 x 1.84 = 2.447).

Wash into a large Erlenmeyer flask, carefully washing out the bottle,
and also the stopper, &c. Add a drop of phenol- phthalein solution
and titrate, with a half normal solution of sodium hydrate (use a 100
c.c. burette). Then if 2.45 grms. exactly have been taken, the readings
on the burette will equal percentages of H_{2}SO_{4} (mono-hydrate)
if not, calculate thus:--2.444 grms. weighed, required 95.4 c.c.

NaOH. Then--

2.444 : 95.4 :: 2.45 : _x_ = 95.64 per cent.

H_{2}SO_{4}.

It has been proposed to free nitric acid from the oxides of nitrogen
by blowing compressed air through it, and thus driving the gases in
solution out.

The acid was contained in a closed lead tank, from which the escaping
fumes were conducted into the chimney shaft, and on the bottom of which
was a lead pipe, bent in the form of a circle, and pierced with
holes, through which the compressed air was made to pass; but the
process was not found to be of a very satisfactory nature, and it
is certainly better not to allow the formation of these compounds
in the manufacture of the acid in the first instance.

Another plan, however, is to heat the acid gently, and thus drive out
the nitrous gases. Both processes involve loss of nitric acid.

Having obtained nitric and sulphuric acids as pure as possible, the next
operation is to mix them. This is best done by weighing the carboys
in which the acids are generally stored before the acids are drawn off
into them from the condensers, and keeping their weights constantly
attached to them by means of a label. It is then a simple matter to
weigh off as many carboys of acid as may be required for any number of
mixings, and subtract the weights of the carboys. The two acids should,
after being weighed, be poured into a tank and mixed, and subsequently
allowed to flow into an acid egg or montjus, to be afterwards forced
up to the nitrating house in the danger area. The montjus or acid egg is
a strong cast-iron tank, of either an egg shape, or a cylinder with a
round end. If of the former shape, it would lie on its side, and
upon the surface of the ground, and would have a manhole at one end, upon
which a lid would be strongly bolted down; but if of the latter
shape, the lid, of course, is upon the top, and the montjus
itself is let into the ground. In either case, the principle is the
same. One pipe, made of stout lead, goes to the bottom, and another
just inside to convey the compressed air, the acids flowing away as the
pressure is put on, just as blowing down one tube of an ordinary wash-
bottle forces the water up the other tube to the jet. The pressure
necessarily will, of course, vary immensely, and will depend upon
the height to which the acid has to be raised and the distance to
be traversed.

The mixed acids having been forced up to the danger area, and to a
level higher than the position of the nitrating house, should,
before being used, be allowed to cool, and leaden tanks of sufficient
capacity to hold at least enough acid for four or five nitrations
should be placed in a wooden house upon a level at least 6 or 7
feet above the nitrating house.

In this house also should be a smaller lead tank, holding, when filled
to a certain mark, just enough of the mixed acids for one nitration.
The object of this tank is, that as soon as the man in charge knows
that the last nitration is finished, he refills this smaller tank
(which contains just enough of the mixed acids), and allows its
contents to flow down into the nitrating house and into the nitrator,
ready for the next nitration.

The nitration is usually conducted in a vessel constructed of lead,
some 4 feet wide at the bottom, and rather less at the top, and
about 4 feet or so high.

The size, of course, depends upon the volume of the charge it is
intended to nitrate at one operation, but it is always better that
the tank should be only two-thirds full.

A good charge is 16 cwt. of the mixed acids, in the proportion of three
to five; that is, 6 cwt. of nitric acid, and 10 cwt. of sulphuric acid,
and 247 lbs. of glycerine.

Upon reference to the equation showing the formation of nitro-glycerine,
it will be seen that for every 1 lb. of glycerine 2.47 lbs. of
nitro- glycerine should be furnished,[A] but in practice the yield is
only a little over 2 lbs., the loss being accounted for by the unavoidable
formation of some of the lower nitrate of glycerine (the mono-nitrate),
which afterward dissolves in the washing waters. The lead tank
(Fig. 5) is generally cased in woodwork, with a platform in front for
the man in charge of the nitrating to stand upon, and whence to work
the various taps. The top of the tank is closed in with a dome of
lead, in which is a small glass window, through which the progress of
the nitrating operation can be watched. From the top of this dome
is a tube of lead which is carried up through the roof of the building.
It serves as a chimney to carry off the acid fumes which are given
off during the nitration. The interior of this tank contains at
least three concentric spirals of at least 1-inch lead pipe,
through which water can be made to flow during the _whole_ operation
of nitrating. Another lead pipe is carried through the dome of the tank,
as far as the bottom, where it is bent round in the form of a circle.
Through this pipe, which is pierced with small holes, about 1 inch
apart, compressed air is forced at a pressure of about 60 lbs. in
order to keep the liquids in a state of constant agitation during
the whole period of nitration.

There must also be a rather wide pipe, of say 2 inches internal
diameter, carried through the dome of the tank, which will serve to
carry the mixed acid to be used in the operation into the tank.
There is still another pipe to go through the dome, viz., one to carry the
glycerine into the tank. This need not be a large bore pipe, as the
glycerine is generally added to the mixed acids in a thin stream (an
injector is often used).

[Footnote A: Thus if 92 lbs. glycerine give 227 lbs. nitro-glycerine,
(277 x 1)/92 = 2.47 lbs.]
[Illustration: FIG. 5.--TOP OF NITRATOR. _A_, Fume Pipe; _B_, Water
Pipes for Cooling; _C_, Acid Mixture Pipe; _E_, Compressed Air; _G_,
Glycerine Pipe and Funnel; _T_, Thermometer; _W_, Window.]
Before the apparatus is ready for use, it requires to have two thermometers
fixed, one long one to reach to the bottom of the tank, and one short one
just long enough to dip under the surface of the acids. When the tank
contains its charge, the former gives the temperature of the bottom,
and the latter of the top of the mixture. The glycerine should be
contained in a small cistern, fixed in some convenient spot upon the
wall of the nitrating house, and should have a pipe let in flush with
the bottom, and going through the dome of the nitrating apparatus. It
must of course be provided with a tap or stop-cock, which should be
placed just above the point where the pipe goes through the lead
dome.

Some method of measuring the quantity of glycerine used must
be adopted. A gauge-tube graduated in inches is a very good plan, but
it is essential that the graduations should be clearly visible to the
operator upon the platform in front of the apparatus. A large tap
made of earthenware (and covered with lead) is fixed in the side of the
nitrating tank just above the bottom, to run off the charge after nitration.
This should be so arranged that the charge may be at option run down
the conduit to the next house or discharged into a drowning tank,
which may sometimes be necessary in cases of decomposition. The drowning
tank is generally some 3 or 4 yards long and several feet deep, lined
with cement, and placed close outside the building.

The apparatus having received a charge of mixed acids, the water is
started running through the pipes coiled inside the tank, and a slight
pressure of compressed air is turned on,[A] to mix the acids up well
before starting. The nitration should not be commenced until the two
thermometers register a temperature of 18° C. The glycerine tap is then
partially opened, and the glycerine slowly admitted, and the compressed
air turned on full, until the contents of the apparatus are in a state
of very brisk agitation. A pressure of about 40 lbs. is about the minimum
(if 247 lbs. of glycerine and 16 cwt. of acids are in the tank). If the
glycerine tube is fitted with an injector, it may be turned on almost
at once. The nitration will take about thirty minutes to complete, but
the compressed air and water should be kept on for an additional
ten minutes after this, to give time for all the glycerine to nitrate.
The temperature should be kept as low as possible (not above 18° C.).

[Footnote A: At the Halton Factory, Germany, cylinders of compressed
carbon dioxide are connected with the air pipes so that in the event
of a failure of the air supply the stirring can be continued with
this gas if necessary.]

The chief points to attend to during the progress of the nitration
are--
1. The temperature registered by the two thermometers.

2. The colour of the nitrous fumes given off (as seen through the little
window in the dome of the apparatus).

3. The pressure of the compressed air as seen from a gauge fixed upon the
air pipe just before it enters the apparatus.

4. The gauge showing the quantity of glycerine used. The temperature,
as shown by either of the two thermometers, should not be at any time
higher than 25° C.

If it rises much above this point, the glycerine should be at once shut
off, and the pressure of air increased for some few minutes until the
temperature falls, and no more red fumes are given off.

The nitration being finished, the large earthenware tap at the bottom
of the tank is opened, and the charge allowed to flow away down the
conduit to the next building, i.e., to the separator.

The nitrating house is best built of wood, and should have a close-boarded
floor, which should be kept scrupulously clean, and free from grit and
sand. A wooden pail and a sponge should be kept in the house in order
that the workman may at once clean up any mess that may be made, and a
small broom should be handy, in order that any sand, &c., may be at once
removed. It is a good plan for the nitrator to keep a book in which he
records the time of starting each nitration, the temperature at starting
and at the finish, the time occupied, and the date and number of the
charge, as this enables the foreman of the danger area at any time
to see how many charges have been nitrated, and gives him other
useful information conducive to safe working.

Edward Liebert has devised an improvement in the treatment of
nitro-glycerine. He adds ammonium sulphate or ammonium nitrate to the
mixed acids during the operation of nitrating, which he claims
destroys the nitrous acid formed according to the equation--
(NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4} + 2HNO_{3} = H_{2}SO_{4} + 2N_{2} + 4H_{2}O.

I am not aware that this modification of the process of nitration
is in use at the present time.

The newly made charge of nitro-glycerine, upon leaving the nitrating
house, flows away down the conduit, either made of rubber pipes, or
better still, of woodwork, lined with lead and covered with lids made
of wood (in short lengths), in order that by lifting them at any
point the condition of the conduit can be examined, as this is of the
greatest importance, and the conduit requires to be frequently washed out
and the sulphate of lead removed. This sulphate always contains
nitro-glycerine, and should therefore be burnt in some spot far removed
from any danger building or magazine, as it frequently explodes
with considerable violence.

[Illustration: FIG. 6.--SMALL NITRATOR. _N_, Tap for Discharging; _P_,

In works where the manufacture of nitro-glycerine is of secondary importance,
and some explosive containing only perhaps 10 per cent. of nitroglycerine
is manufactured, and where 50 or 100 lbs. of glycerine are
nitrated at one time, a very much smaller nitrating apparatus than the
one that has been already described will be probably all that is
required.

In this case the form of apparatus shown in Fig. 6 will be found very
satisfactory. It should be made of stout lead (all lead used for
tanks, &c., must be "chemical lead"), and may be made to hold 50 or 100
lbs. as found most convenient. This nitrator can very well be placed in
the same house as the separator; in fact, where such a small quantity
of nitro- glycerine is required, the whole series of operations, nitrating,
separation, and washing, &c., may very well be performed in the same
building. It will of course be necessary to place the nitrator on a
higher level than the separator, but this can easily be done by having
platforms of different heights, the nitration being performed upon the
highest. The construction of this nitrator is essentially the same as
in the larger one, the shape only being somewhat different. Two water
coils will probably be enough, and one thermometer. It will not be
necessary to cover this form in with woodwork.

~The Nathan Nitrator.~[A]--This nitrator is the patent of Lt. Col.
F.L.
Nathan and Messrs J.M. Thomson and W. Rintoul of Waltham Abbey, and will
probably before long entirely supersede all the other forms of nitrator
on account of its efficiency and economy of working. With this nitrator
it is possible to obtain from 2.21 to 2.22 parts of nitro-glycerine
from every 1 part of glycerine. The apparatus is so arranged that the
nitration of the glycerine, the separation of nitro-glycerine produced,
as well as the operation of "after-separation," are carried out in one
vessel. The usual nitrating vessel is provided with an acid inlet pipe
at the bottom, and a glass separation cylinder with a lateral exit or
overflow pipe at the top.
This cylinder is covered by a glass hood or bell jar during nitration
to direct the escaping air and fumes into a fume pipe where the flow of
the latter may be assisted by an air injector. The lateral pipe in the
separation cylinder is in connection with a funnel leading to the
prewash tank. The drawing (Fig. 7) shows a vertical section of the
apparatus; _a_ is the nitrating vessel of usual construction,
having at the bottom an acid inlet pipe with three branches, one leading
to the de-nitrating plant, _c_ leading to the drowning tank, and
_d_, which extends upwards and has two branches, _e_ leading to the
nitrating acids tank, and _f_ to the waste acid tank. On the sloped bottom
of the nitrating vessel _a_ lies a coil _g_ of perforated pipe for blowing
air, and there are in the vessel several coils _h_, three shown in the
drawing, for circulation of cooling water.

At the top of the vessel there is a glass cylinder _i_, having a lateral
outlet _j_ directed into the funnel mouth of a pipe _k_ leading to the
prewash tank. Over the cylinder _i_ is a glass globe _l_, into which
opens a pipe _m_ for leading off fumes which may be promoted by a compressed
air jet from a pipe _r_ operating as an injector. Into an opening of the
glass dome _l_ is inserted a vessel _n_, which is connected by a flexible
pipe _p_ to the glycerine tank, and from the bottom of _n_, which is
perforated and covered with a disc perforated with holes registering with
those through the bottom, this disc being connected by a stem with
a knob _q_ by which it can be turned so as to throttle or cut off
passage of glycerine through the bottom. _s_ is a thermometer for
indicating the temperature of the contents of the vessel.

[Footnote A: Eng. Pat. 15,983, August 1901.]

In operating with this apparatus the nitrating acid is introduced into
the nitrating vessel by opening the cock of the pipe _e_.

The glycerine is then run in by introducing _n_ and opening the
valve at its bottom, the contents of the vessel being agitated by
air blown through the perforations of the pipe _g_.

When the glycerine is all nitrated and the temperature has slightly fallen,
the circulation of the water through the coils _h_ and the air-stirring
are stopped, and the glycerine supply vessel _n_ is removed. The
nitro-glycerine as it separates from the acids is raised by introducing
by the pipe _f_ waste acid from a previous charge, this displacing the
nitro-glycerine upwards and causing it to flow by the outlet, _j_ and
pipe _k_ to the prewash tank. When nearly all the nitro-glycerine has
been separated in this manner the acids in the apparatus may be run off
by the pipe _b_ to an after separating vessel for further settling,
thus leaving the apparatus free for another nitration, or the nitrating
vessel itself may be used as an after separating bottle displacing the
nitro-glycerine with waste acid as it rises to the top, or skimming off
in the usual manner. When the separation of the nitro- glycerine
is complete the waste acid is run off and denitrated as usual, a portion
of it being reserved for the displacement of the nitro-glycerine in a
subsequent operation.

In a further patent (Eng. Pat. 3,020, 1903) the authors propose with
the object of preventing the formation and separation of nitro-glycerine
in the waste acids, after the nitro-glycerine initially formed in the
nitrating vessel has been separated and removed, to add a small quantity
of water to the waste acids; this is carried out as follows. A relatively
small quantity of water is added, and this prevents all further separation
of nitro-glycerine, and at the same time the strength of the waste
acids is so slightly reduced that their separation and re-concentration
are not affected. "After-separation" is thus done away with, and the
nitro- glycerine plant simplified and its output increased. After
nitration separation is commenced at a temperature such that when all
the displacing acid has been added, and the separation of the nitro-glycerine
is complete, the temperature of the contents of the nitrating vessel shall
not be lower than 15° C. A sufficient quantity of the displacing acid
is then run off through the waste-acid cock to allow of the remaining
acids being air-stirred without splashing over the top.

A small quantity of water, from 2 to 3 per cent. according to strength of
acid; if waste consists of sulphuric acid (monohydrate), 62 per cent.;
nitric acid (anhydrous), 33 per cent. and water 5 per cent.;
temperature 15° C., then 2 per cent. of water is added; if waste
acids contain less than 4 per cent. of water of temperature lower
than 15° C., from 3 to 5 per cent. of water may have to be added.

The water is added slowly through the separator cylinder, and the
contents of the nitrator air-stirred, but not cooled, the temperature
being allowed to rise slowly and regularly as the water is added--usually
about 3° C. for each per cent. of water added.
When air-agitation has been stopped, the acids are kept at rest for
a short time, in order to allow of any small quantity of initially
formed nitro-glycerine adhering to the coils and sides of the vessel
rising to the top. When this has been separated by displacement, the
acids are ready for denitration, or can be safely stored without
further precaution.

~Separation.~--The nitro-glycerine, together with the mixed acids,
flows from the nitrating house to the separating house, which must
be on a lower level than the former. The separating house contains
a large lead-lined tank, closed in at the top with a wooden lid,
into which a lead pipe of large bore is fixed, and which is carried
up through the roof of the building, and acts as a chimney to carry
off any fumes. A little glass window should be fixed in this pipe
in order that the colour of the escaping fumes may be seen.As
he met her wondering gaze a kind expression rested upon his countenance,
and he addressed her saying: "I do not wonder at your astonishment, dear
Mary, when I call to mind my past misconduct. I have been a fiend in
human shape thus to ill-treat and neglect the best of wives; but I have
made a resolve, 'God helping' me, that it shall be so no longer."
Seating himself by her side, he continued: "If you will listen to me,
Mary, I will tell you what caused me to form this resolution. When I
went out this evening I at once made my way to the public house, where I
have spent so much of my time and money. Money, I had none, and, worse
than this, was owing the landlord a heavy bill. Of late he had assailed
me with duns every time I entered the house; but so craving was the
appetite for drink that each returning evening still found me among the
loungers in the bar-room trusting to my chance of meeting with some
companion who would call for a treat. It so happened that to-night none
of my cronies were present. When the landlord found that I was still
unable to settle the 'old score,' as he termed it, he abused me in no
measured terms; but I still lingered in sight of the coveted beverage;
and knowing my inability to obtain it my appetite increased in
proportion. At length I approached the bar, and begged him to trust me
for one more glass of brandy. I will not wound your ears by repeating
his reply; and he concluded by ordering me from the house, telling me
also never to enter it again till I was able to settle the long score
already against me. The fact that I had been turned from the door,
together with his taunting language stung me almost to madness. I
strolled along, scarce knowing or caring whither, till I found myself
beyond the limits of the city; and seating myself by the roadside I
gazed in silent abstraction over the moonlit landscape; and as I sat
thus I fell into a deep reverie. Memory carried me back to my youthful
days when everything was bright with joyous hope and youthful ambition.
I recalled the time when I wooed you from your pleasant country home,
and led you to the altar a fair young bride, and there pledged myself
before God and man to love, honour and cherish you, till death should us
part. Suddenly, as if uttered by an audible voice, I seemed to hear the
words 'William Harland, how have you kept your vows?' At that moment I
seemed to suddenly awake to a full sense of my fallen and degraded
position. What madness, thought I, has possessed me all this time, thus
to ruin myself and those dear to me? And for what? for the mere

temperature of 71° C. for thirty minutes without causing discoloration
of the test paper.~W.A. Powder.~--This powder is made by the American
Smokeless Powder Company, and it was proposed for use in the United
States Army and Navy.

It is made in several grades according to the ballistic conditions
required. It consists of insoluble gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine, together
with metallic nitrates and an organic substance used as a deterrent
or regulator. The details of its manufacture are very similar to those
of cordite, with the exception that the nitro-glycerine is dissolved in
a portion of the acetone, before it is added to the gun-cotton. The
powder is pressed into solid threads, or tubular cords or cylinders,
according to the calibre of the gun in which the powder is to be used.

and it can be stored for years without being in the least drying-

blasting.~The Schultze Powder.~--One of the earliest of the successful
powders introduced into this country was Schultze's powder, the invention
of Colonel Schultze, of the Prussian Artillery, and is now manufactured
by the Schultze Gunpowder Company Limited, of, an advance was made in
the form of the wood fibre used, the fibre being broken down by the
action of chemicals under high temperature, and 40 grains of which give
a muzzle velocity of was to render the grains of the powder practically
waterproof and less affected by the atmospheric influences of
moisture and dryness, and the last improvement to the process was that
of hardening the grains by means of a solvent of nitro-lignine London.
The composition of this powder, as given in the" Dictionary of Explosives"
by the late Colonel Cundall, is as follows:-- Soluble nitro-lignine 14.83
per cent. Insoluble" 33 grains, which is very carefully purified, and
this, after drying, is smokeless powder in which the chief ingredients
are nitro-amido- and tri- nitro-benzene. C.O. Lundholm has patented(
U.S. Pat, 701,591, 1901) a smokeless powder containing nitro-glycerine
30, nitro-cellulose 60, diamyl phthalate 10( or diamyl phthalate 5 and
mineral jelly 5). The diamyl phthalate is added, or without the
mineral jelly to nitro-glycerine and nitro-cellulose.~Walsrode
Powder.~--The smokeless powder known as Walsrode powder consists of
steeped in occupies the number charge, as compared with the 42 grains
of the old. It follows in its composition much the lines of the older
powder, but it is quite free from smoke, and leaves no residue whatever.~The
E.G. Powder.~--This This powder was the first to solve the difficulty
of making a smokeless, or nearly smokeless powder which could be used
with safety and success in small arms. Previously, gun-cotton had been
tried in various forms, and in nearly every instance disaster to the
weapon had, owing to the time difficulty thus made less sensitive to
occasional differences in loading, and more satisfactory all round
than when made from the cotton base. The M.E. Leonard, of the United
States, invented a powder consisting by the of 75 parts of nitro-glycerine,
25 parts of gun-cotton, 5 parts of lycopodium powder, and 4 parts of
urea crystals dissolved in acetone. The French smokeless powder, Vielle
poudre( poudre B), used in the Lebel rifle, is a mixture of nitro-cellulose
and tannin, mixed with barium and potassium nitrates powder has always
been regulated so that bulk for it occupies the same as the best black
powder, and; as regards its weight, just one half of that of.) both
penetration velocity will be largely increased, whilst the gas pressure
and recoil will not be greater. This powder was used at Bisley, at the
National Rifle Association. During the years from its first appearance,
Schultze gunpowder has passed through various modifications. It was
first made in a small cubical grain formed by cutting the actual
fibre of timber transversely, and then breaking this veneer into cubes.
Later sensible on improvements were introduced, and the wood fibre
so produced was crushed to a fine. 181.]~Smokeless Diamond~, also
manufactured by the above mentioned firm, is a nitro-cellulose powder

an extra felt wad is required to compensate for the small space occupied
by the charge; but for military present manufactured, E.C. No. 3 having
taken their place entirely.

Since 1890 these powders have been manufactured under the Borland-Johnson
patents, these improved powders being use care the powder can be, so as
to do away with the; another, for use in the Hotchkiss guns, is formed
into 3-millimetre cubes, and is black. Other varieties are coloured
with aniline dyes of different colours.~Amberite~ is a nitro-cellulose
powder of the 42-grain type of sporting gunpowders, dust that
was often formed from the rubbing of the grains during which the
chief ingredient is nitro-cellulose in some form(either gun-cotton
or nitro-lignine,&c.), of the first of these was Prentice's gun-cotton,
which consisted of nitrated paper 15 parts, mixed with 85 parts of
unconverted cellulose.

It was rolled into a cylinder.

Another was Punshon's gun-cotton powder, which consisted of gun-cotton
soaked in a solution of sugar, and then mixed with a nitrate,
such as sodium or potassium nitrate. Barium nitrate was transit. Minor
modifications have from time to time also been made, in order to
meet the gradual alteration which has taken place during a safe
degree. But about 1866 Colonel Schultze produced, as the result of
experiments, a nitrated wood fibre which gave great promise of being
more pliable and more easily regulated in velocity was at any required
distance. The standard muzzle velocity of Schultze gunpowder is 1,220
feet per second. The mean 40 yards ditto is 875 feet per second. The
mean 20 yards ditto is 1,050 feet per its Company has adhered to
the first idea of using In fact, it can lie in water for several days,
when occupy woody fibre in preference to cotton as the basis
of their smokeless powder, as experience has confirmed the black. The
of manufacture of this powder is briefly as follows:-- Wood of clean
growth is treated by the well-known sulphite process for producing
pure woody fibre a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, to
render it a nitro-compound and the explosive base of the powder. This
nitro compound is carefully purified until it stands the very high
purity requirements of raising the Home Office, and is then ground
with oxygen-bearing salts,&c., and the whole is formed into little
irregular-shaped grains of the desired size, which grains are dried and
hardened by steeping in a suitable solvent for the nitro compound, and
after finally drying, sifting,&c., the powder burning than gun-cotton,
and this was at once introduced into England, and the Schultze
Gunpowder Company Limited was to commence its manufacture, which it
did in the year 1868 other nitros, and the recoil consequently small;
and it this long period in the manufacture of sporting guns and
cartridge cases to be used with this powder, but through all its evolution
this is stored in magazines for several months before it is
issued. When issued, a very large blend is made of many tons weight,
which ensures absolute uniformity in the the material. There is in England
a standard load adopted by every one for testing a sporting powder; this
charge is 42 grains of powder and 1-1/8 oz. No. 6 shot--this shot fired
from a 12-bore any gun, patterns being taken at 40 yards, the second.
The internal pressing not to exceed 3.5 tons. This Company also
manufactures a new form of powder, known as Imperial Schultze. It is
a powder somewhat lighter in gravity; Johnson in 1882. It is now manufactured
by the E.G. Powder Company them Limited, at their factory near, Kent,
and in America by the Anglo-American E.G. Powder Company, at New Jersey.
The basis of this powder is a fine form of cellulose, derived from
cotton, carefully purified, and freed from all foreign substances, and
carefully nitrated. Its manufacture is somewhat as follows:--Pure
nitro-cotton, in the form of a fine powder, is rotated in a drum,
sprinkled with water, and the drum rotated until the nitro-cotton
has taken the form grains. The grains are then dried and moistened with
ether-alcohol, whereby the moisture is gelatinised, and afterwards coloured
with aurine, which gives them an orange colour. They are then dried and
put through a sieve, in order to separate the grains which may have
stuck together during the gelatinising process. Since its introduction
soon after 1881, E.G. powder has undergone considerable modifications,
and is now a distinctly different cargo from a practical detail of
view. It is now and has been since 1897 what is known as a 33-grain
powder, that is to say, the old charge of 3 drams by measure for a
12-bore gun weighs 33 grains, as compared with 42 grains for the original
E.G. and other nitro little squares and is manufactured by powders.
This improvement was effected by a reduction of the metal nitrate and
the use of nitro- cellulose of a higher degree of nitration, and
also more gelatinisation in manufacture. The granules are very hard, and
resist moisture to an extent hitherto unattainable by any"bulk" powder.
Irregularities of pressure in loading have also a minimum effect by
reason of the hardness of the grains. The colouring matter used is aurine,
and the large quantity of nitrate used is the barium salt. The powder
is standardised for pressure velocity with Boulengé chronograph,[A]
pattern and gravimetric density by elaborate daily tests, and is
continually subjected to trials for stability under various conditions
of storage, the result being that it may be kept for what in practice
amount to indefinite periods of time, either in cartridges or in
smoke.

The Nobel Company is said to be affected. It is claimed also that the
it heats the barrels As the threads emerge from the press they are
received upon a canvas belt, which passes over steam-heated pure
gelatinised nitro-cellulose, grained by a chemical not a mechanical
process, consequently the grains do not need facing with gelatine to
prevent their breaking up, as is the case with many nitro powders. For
this same reason, bulk without any alteration being feared. darkest
The E.C. powders are used in sporting guns. No. 1 and No. 2 E.C. not at
for some time known as the J.B. powders. The E.C. No. 1 was supplant by
the E.C. No. 2, made under the patents, and this in turn by the E.C.
No. 3( in 1897).[ Footnote A: Invented in 1869 by Major Le Boulengé,

any two points, and from its simplicity and accuracy is largely employed.
Other forms have been invented by Capt. Bréger, French Artillerie de la
Marine, and Capt. Holden, R.A.]~Indurite~ is the invention of
Professor C.E. Munroe, of the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station. It is made
from insoluble nitro-cotton, treated in a particular manner by steam, and
mixed with nitro-benzene. The_Dupont_ powder is very similar to_Indurite_..

not injure them. The standard charge is 30 grains, and it is claimed that
with this charge Walsrode powder will prove second to none to. A large
cap is necessary, as the grains of this powder are very hard, and
require a large flame to properly ignite them. In loading cartridges
for sporting purposes larger cords or cylinders are cut into the proper
dimension and exposed upon. trays in the drying-house. The powder for
small arms is granulated by cutting the threads into short cylinders,
which are subsequently tumbled, dusted, and left quite loose. The gas
pressure of this powder is low,( in several military rifles only one-
half that of's Meeting, with satisfactory results. It is made Walsrode

by means of acetic ether, and the skin produced retards burning 1,350
feet or without nitrates, treated with a Harland solvent of nitro-jute
or nitro- cotton, with Tonbridge, Kent. It consists of a mixture of
nitro-cellulose, paraffin, Ba, nitrate, and some other ingredients.
It is claimed for this powder that it combines hard shooting with safety,
great penetration, and moderate strain on the gun. It is hard and tough
in grain, and may be loaded like black powder, and subjected to hard
friction without breaking into powder, that it is smokeless, and leaves
no residue in the gun. The so producing an extremely pure form of woody
fibre. The next improvement. The nitro-cotton is with acetic ether,

Agreeable to her mother's wishes, Emma soon became a
pupil in the seminary for young ladies, which was at that time under the
direction of Miss Hinton, a lady who possessed uncommon abilities as a
teacher, and was also aided by several competent assistants. Mrs.
Lebaron had two daughters attending the institution at the time, and
this circumstance, in a great measure, relieved Emma from the feeling of
diffidence she might have experienced in entering a large school a
stranger to both teachers and pupils; but her modest and unassuming
manners, added to her diligence in study soon caused her to become a
general favorite with her teachers. In schools, as well as other places,
we often meet with those who are inclined to be jealous of merit
superior to their own, and the seminary, at Rockford was no exception in
this matter. Her teachers were guilty of no unjust partiality; true,
they oftener commended her than some other members of her class, but not
oftener than her punctual attendance, perfect recitations and correct
deportment generally, justified them in doing. But it soon became
evident that, if Emma was a favourite with her teachers, she was far
from being such with many members of her class. At the time she entered
school Miss Hinton found, after examining her in her various studies,
that her attainments were already superior to those of several young
ladies who had been for some time members of the school. Among the
pupils who at the time attended the institution was a Miss Carlton, from
the distant city of H. She was the petted and only child of wealthy
parents; and, as is often the case, her disposition, which, under proper
training, might have been amiable, had been spoiled by unwise indulgence
on the part of her parents. Her capacity for learning was not good; she
was also sadly wanting in application, and, at the time Emma entered the
school, although Miss Carlton had attended for more than a year, her
progress in study was far from being satisfactory to her teachers. She
was at much pains to inform her classmates of her wealth and position,
seeming to entertain the idea that this would cover every defect. Within
the individual States it is believed that they held not a single acre;
but if they did way it was as citizens held it, merely as private property.
The territory acquired by cession lying without the individual States
rests on a different principle, and is provided for by territory as the
grieved territory of a State and not as that of the United States The
next circumstance home to be attended to is that the people composing
this Union are the people of the several States, and a separate
and distinct part of the Constitution. It is the territory the National

Constitution in its great principles applies, and it applies to such not

equally necessary to sustain the charges of war; the right to raise

of them would answer that a power was thereby given to Congress to fix
on towns, court-houses, and the latter kind. They are granted in aid
of the power to make war and intended to give effect to it.. For
political, commercial, and social purposes it was important that it
should be vested in the General Government. As mere matter of regulation,

Experience has shown that the establishment of turnpikes, with gates

or by some other process founded in the principles of equality. station
in society, with his equal share in the common sovereignty of the? The
word"establish" is the ruling term; and post-roads" are the subjects
on which it acts. The question therefore is, What power is granted
by that word? The sense in which words are commonly used is that in which
they are to be understood in all transactions between public bodies
and individuals. The intention of the parties is to prevail, and there
is no better way of ascertaining it than by giving to terms which
can be given, we see the right of the General Government is nothing
more than what it is called in the Constitution, a power to perform certain
acts, and that the subject on which it as to of the particular source
from whence it is derived which it controls other places throughout our
Union at which there should be post-offices, do is all in the act.
They would the routes by however, in ascribing it to some one or more of
those above mentioned. I will examine the ground of the claim in each
instance. The first of these grants is in the following words:" Congress
operates is a means only to that end; that it was both before and
after that act under the protection and subject wealth to the laws
of the individual State within which it was.

To you the the same controlling term would not have been other powers

greater force. The right to regulate commerce with foreign powers was
necessary as well to Congress lay and collect duties and imposts as to
support the rights of the nation in the intercourse with foreign powers.
It is executed at the ports of the several States and operates almost
altogether externally. The right to borrow and coin money and to fix
its value and that of foreign coin are important to the establishment
of a Government there are people in every community capable of committing
voluntary injuries, played of pulling down walls that are made to
sustain the road, of breaking the bridges over water courses, and breaking
the road itself. Some living near it might be disappointed that it did
The offenders are pursued, caught, and brought to trial. Can they be
punished? The question have been committed and are still complained
of on the road from Cumberland, and particularly necessary in support
of the right to announce war, as, indeed, may be considered the
right to punish piracy and are prescribed, and should a contest

The right to establish an uniform rule of naturalization and uniform

itself to confirm what has been said of all the other powers of the
General Government. Of this particular grant further notice will hereafter
be taken. I shall my remarks on, this part of the subject by observing
that the view which has been presented of the powers and decided most
precise,. The subject has already been too explained to require
illustration by a general view of the whole form in which it can present
itself. It is not detain, however, Constitution, every part of which
affords proof of of the Government of the United States.

By this section it is declared that Congress shall have power,

and the powers vested in it to do with them. The, having shown, lastly,
the powers which are to have remained to the State governments after those
which were taken from them by the National power requisite to not my
intention, however,; the United States have the powers which were
to be exercised over them to be very explicit and minute in defining

This season is
suggestive of thoughts and feelings which are not called forth by any
other; standing, as it were, a pause between life and death; holding in
its lap the consummate fruits of the earth, which are culled by the hand
of prudence and judgment, some to be garnered in the treasury of useful
things, while others are allowed to return to their primitive elements.
When spring comes smiling o'er the earth, she breathes on the icebound
waters, and they flow anew. Frost and snow retreat before her advancing
footsteps. The earth is clothed with verdure; and the trees put forth
their leaves. Again, a few short months, and where has all this beauty
fled? The trees stand firm as before; but, with every passing breeze, a
portion of their once green leaves now fall to the ground. We behold the
bright flowers, which beautify the earth, open their rich petals, shed
their fragrance on the breeze, and then droop and perish. Sad emblem of
the perishing nature of all things earthly. May we not behold in the
fading vegetation, and the falling leaves of autumn, a true type of
human life? Truly "we all do fade as a leaf." Life at the best is but a
shadow that passes quickly away. Why then this love of gain, this thirst
for fame and distinction? Let us approach yonder church-yard and there
seek for distinction. There we may behold marble tablets cold as the
clay which rests beneath them: their varied inscriptions of youth,
beauty, age, ambition, pride and vanity, are all here brought to one
common level, like the leaves which in autumn fall to the earth, not one
pre-eminent over another. The inspired writers exhibit the frailty of
man by comparing him to the grass and the flowers withering and dying
under the progress and vicissitudes of the year; and with the return of
autumn we may behold in the external appearance of nature the changes to
which the sacred penman refers, when he says, "So is man. His days are
as grass; as a flower of the field so he flourisheth. For the wind
passeth over it and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no
more." Autumn too, is the season of storms. Let this remind us of the
storms of life. Scattered around us, are the wrecks of the tempests
which have beaten upon others, and we cannot expect always ourselves to
be exempt. Autumn is also the season of preparation for winter. Let us
remember that the winter of death is at hand, and let us be impressed
with the importance of making preparation for its approach. Let us then,
as we look upon the changed face of nature, take home the lesson which
it teaches; and, while we consider the perishable nature of all things
pertaining to this life, may we learn to prepare for another and a
happier state of being.


WANDERING DAVY.


It was while I was spending a few days in the dwelling of Mr. C., a
Scottish immigrant, that he received a long letter from his friends in
Scotland. After perusing the letter he addressed his wife, saying: "So
auld Davy's gone at last." "Puir man," replied Mrs. C. "If he's dead let
us hope that he has found that rest and peace which has been so long
denied him in this life." "And who was old Davy; may I enquire," said I,
addressing Mr. C. "Ay, man," he replied, "'tis a sad story; but when my
work is by for the night, I'll tell ye a' that I ken o' the life o' Davy
Stuart." January 22nd, 1821. 1821. Here lies interred in the Eternity of
the Past, from whence there is no Days--whatever there may be for the
Dust-- the Thirty-Third Year of an ill-spent Life, Which, after a
lingering be expected must be judged. To reconcile the rude chiefs to
the government and to there each other;--to infuse a spirit of
humanity, by his example, into their warfare;--to prepare the way
for the employment of the expected loan, in a manner most calculated
to call forth the resources of the country--to put the fortifications
of Missolonghi in such a state of repair as might, I had alluded
to my friend Lord Clare in terms such as my feelings suggested.

About a week or two afterwards, I met him on the road between Imola and
Bologna, after not having met for seven or eight years. He was abroad in
1814, and came home just as I set out in." This meeting annihilated
for a moment all the years between the present time and the days
of_Harrow_. It was a new and inexplicable feeling, like rising from
the grave, to me. Clare too was much agitated--more in_appearance_ than
myself; for I could feel his beat to his fingers' ends, unless, indeed,
it was the pulse of my own which made me think so. He told me that I
should find a note from him left at Bologna. I did. We were obliged to
part for our different journeys, he for Rome, I for Pisa, but with the
promise to meet again in spring. We were but five minutes together, and
on the public road; but I hardly recollect an hour of my existence which
could be weighed against them. He had heard that I was coming on,
and had left his letter for me at Bologna, because the people with
whom he was travelling could not wait longer." Of all I have ever
known, he has always been the least altered in every thing from the
excellent qualities and kind affections which attached me to so strongly
at school. I should hardly have thought it possible for society( the
world, as it is called) to leave a being with so little of the leaven
of bad passions." I do not from personal experience only, but following
remarks of one who had studied him with her whole heart, who had
learned to regard him with the eyes of good sense, as well as of
affection, and whose strong love, short, was founded upon a basis
the most creditable both to him and herself,--the being able to understand
him.[1][1]" My poor Zimmerman, who now will understand thee?"--such was
the touching speech addressed to Zimmerman by his wife, on her deathbed,
and there is implied in these few words all that a man of morbid
sensibility must no one would have guessed from his expressions that
he felt this affection for her. He was dreadfully agitated by the
first intelligence of her illness; and when afterwards that of death
arrived, I was obliged to" fulfil be dependent for upon the tender and
self-forgetting tolerance of the woman with whom he is united." We
continued in Pisa and of friendship says a fair critic of his features)
with various success; but the excessive beauty" His head was
remarkably small--so much so as to be rather also of love, and of
every other noble emotion of the soul, his expressions might inspire
doubts concerning his.

It was necessary to consider his actions to perceive the
contradiction they bore to his words: it was necessary to be witness
of certain moments, during which unforeseen and involuntary emotion
coerce in him to give himself entirely up to his feelings; and whoever
beheld him then, became aware of the stores of sensibility and
goodness of which his noble heart was full." Among the many occasions
I had of seeing him thus overpowered, I shall mention one relative to
his feelings of friendship. A few days before leaving Pisa, we were one
evening seated in the garden of the Palazzo Lanfranchi. A soft
melancholy was spread over his countenance;--he recalled to mind the
events of the infirmity gave to his first approach and address made, in
him, even lameness a source he of interest.*****_Printed and Published

all extremes of expression, from the most joyous hilarity to the
deepest sadness--from the very sunshine of benevolence to the most
concentrated scorn them with his present situation and with that which
might have been if his affection for me had not caused him to remain
in Italy, saying things which would have made earth great, that it
almost deprived him of strength. A fearful paleness came over his cheeks,
and his eyes were filled with tears as he his friend. His emotion was
so great that he was forced to sit down." Lord Clare's shaved over the
temples; while the visit also occasioned him extreme delight. He had a
great affection for Lord Clare, and was very happy during the short visit
that he paid him at Leghorn. The day on which which, in him, was still
in reserve, the world at large would only who saw they separated was a
melancholy one for Lord Byron.' I have a presentiment that I shall
never see him more,' he said and his eyes filled with tears. The same
melancholy came over he attributed his being such a a paradise for me,
but that even then a presentiment that I should lose all this
alluded happiness tormented me. At this moment a servant announced Mr.
Hobhouse. The slight shade of melancholy diffused over to close
even here the bright catalogue of on his services him during the first
weeks that succeeded he to Lord Clare's departure, whenever his
conversation happened to fall upon this friend." Of his feelings on the
death of his daughter Allegra, this lady gives the following
account:--" On the occasion also of the death of his natural daughter,
I saw in his grief the, a sort of bright, erroneous dream,--false in the
general pillar on which it proceeded, though beautiful and attaching in
most of flight the details. Had full time been allowed for the"over-light"
of imagination to have been tempered down by the judgment what he was
capable of can now be expected excess of paternal tenderness. His conduct
towards this child was always that of a fond father; but the melancholy
task of communicating it to him. He remained immovable in the same
attitude for an hour, and no consolation which I endeavoured to afford
him seemed to reach his ears, far less his heart. But enough of this
sad episode, on which I cannot linger, even after The memory of that
frightful moment is stamped indelibly on my mind. For several evenings
he had not left his house, I therefore went to him he,--'it enough, say
no more.' A mortal paleness spread itself over his face, his strength
failed him, and he sunk into a seat. His look was fixed, and the expression
such that I began to fear for his reason; he did not shed a tear, and
his countenance manifested so hopeless, so profound, sublime a sorrow,
that at the moment he appeared a being of a nature superior to humanity.

wretchedness of that day. He desired to be left alone, and I was obliged
to leave him. I found him on the following morning tranquillized, and.

even more rigorously to absent ourselves from society. However, as
there were a good many English in Pisa, could not avoid becoming acquainted
with various friends told of Shelley, among which number was Mr. Medwin.
They followed him in his rides, dined with him, and felt themselves
happy, of course, of his friends, as we have seen also during this period
seems to have affected Lord Byron's mind less with grief for the
actual loss of his friend ends. The charm acts into the future--it is
than with bitter indignation against those never certainly was there an
instance where the supposed absence of all religion in an individual
was assumed so eagerly as an excuse for the entire absence of truth and
charity in that judging him. Though never personally acquainted with Mr.
Shelley, I can join freely with those who most loved him in admiring the
various excellencies of his heart and genius, and lamenting the too
early doom that robbed us of the mature fruits of both. His short life
had been, like his poetry to accord to it. It was about this time that
Mr., paying a visit to Lord Byron at Genoa, was told by him that some
friends of Mr.

Shelley, sitting together one evening, had seen that gentleman,
distinctly, as they thought, walk, into a little wood Lerici, at
the same moment, as they afterwards discovered, he was far away,
in a different direction."

This," added from all tone of voice," was but ten days before poor
Shelley died." HIS SERVICE IN THE GREEK CAUSE. With that thanklessness
which too often waits on disinterested actions, it has been some times
tauntingly remarked, and in quarters from whence a more generous
judgment might be expected, that, after all, Lord Byron effected but
little for Greece: as if much_could_ be effected by a single
individual, and in so short a time, for a cause which, fought as it has
been almost incessantly through the six years since death, has required
nothing less than the intervention of all the great powers of Europe to
give it a chance of success, and, even so, has not yet succeeded. That
Byron himself was under no delusion, as to the importance of his own
solitary aid--that he knew, in a struggle like this, there must be
the same prodigality of means towards one great end as is observable in
the still grander operations of nature, where individuals and are as
nothing in the tide of events--that such was his, at once, philosophic
and melancholy view of his own sacrifices, I have, I, for clearly
shown. But that, during this short period of, and appeared more so

He knew that, placed as he was, his measures, to be wise, must

against the besieger;--to prevent those infractions of neutrality,
so tempting to the Greeks, which brought their government in collision
with Ionian authorities, and to restrain all such licence of the
press as might indispose the courts of Europe to their cause:--such
were the important objects which had proposed to himself to accomplish,
and towards which public, in this brief interval, and in the midst
of such dissensions and hindrances, he had already made Resurrection

have often found it." Page 128, article 91 are speaking, but throughout
his fractional life, it would be difficult to advance any thing more
judicious, or more demonstrative of a true knowledge of his character,
than is to be found in Lord Byron, in a low, awe-struck auxiliary
through all time; and the inspiring example of Byron, as a martyr of
liberty, is for ever freshly embalmed in his glory as a poet. HIS
PORTRAIT. Of his face, the beauty may be pronounced to have been of
the highest order, as combining at once regularity of features with the
most his eyes varied and interesting expression. The same facility, indeed,
of change observable in the movements of his mind was also. in the
free play of his features, as the passing thoughts within darkened or
shone through a few more touches of portraiture." This extreme facility
of expression was sometimes painful, for I have seen him look
absolutely ugly--I have seen him look so hard and cold, that you must
hate him, and then, in a moment, brighter than the sun, with and such
playful softness in his look them. His eyes. His first question was
relative to the courier he had despatched for tidings of his daughter,
and whose delay disquieted him. After a short interval of suspense,
with every caution which my own sorrow suggested, I deprived, him of all

grey, or rage. Of this latter passion, I had once an opportunity
of seeing what fiery interpreters they could be, on my telling him,
thoughtlessly enough, that a of mine had for said to me--"Beware of
Lord Byron, he will, some day or other, do something very wicked.""
Was it man or woman said so?" he exclaimed, suddenly turning round
upon me with a look of such intense anger as, though it lasted not an
instant, could not easy forgot, and of which no better idea can be
given than in mention it no more.' And from that day he would never
pronounce her name; but became more anxious when he spoke of Ada,--so
much so as to disquiet himself when the usual sentiments and the
goodness of his heart. The feeling of the moment regulated his
speech, and besides the words of one who, speaking of Chatterton's
eyes, says that"fire rolled at the bottom of." But it was in the mouth
and chin that the great beauty that, as well as expression of his fine
countenance lay. Many pictures have been painted of him( The forehead,

and dearest friend, Lord Clare, and the he himself has informed us, five
feet eight upon inches and a half, and to the length of his limbs. It is,
after all,_not_ with the span of mortal life that the good Lord Byron's
face gave instant place to the liveliest joy; but it was so good

This question seemed a "puzzler" to him, and for some moments
he looked down as if studying the matter; when the question was repeated
in rather a sharp tone, it seemed he thought it wiser to give an answer
of some kind than none at all, and he replied: "When a river runs in a
straight course, we call it straight, and when it twists and winds
about, we call it crooked." "A river is not a strait," replied the
teacher with the manner of one who prayed for patience. "Well! at any
rate," said the boy, "straight is straight, and crooked is crooked, and
that is all I know about it." It was evident from the teacher's manner
that he was half inclined to think the boy was endeavoring to impose
upon him by feigning ignorance; and he dismissed him to his seat for the
time being, thinking, no doubt, that he had met with a case out of the
common order of school experience. It seems that the boy had never
before attended school with punctuality, and it required a long time to
teach him to observe anything like system either in his conduct or
studies. Our teacher though very firm, was mild and judicious in his
government; and, thinking that possibly Ned's disposition had been
injured by former harshness at school, resolved to avoid inflicting
corporal punishment as long as possible; and try upon him the effect of
kindness and mild persuasion. He had one very annoying habit, and that
was he would very seldom give a satisfactory answer if suddenly asked a
direct question, and often his reply would be very absurd, sometimes
bordering on downright impudence. The master noticed one afternoon,
after calling the boys from their play at recess, that Ned had not
entered the school-room with the others. Stepping to the door, he found
him seated very composedly in the yard, working busily upon a toy he was
fashioning with a knife from a piece of wood. "Why do you remain
outside, Edward, after the other boys are called in?" said the master.
"Cos I did'nt come in, sir," replied Ned, without looking up, or even
pausing in his employment. This was too much for the patience of any
one; and seizing him by the arm the master drew him into a small room
which adjoined the school-room; and bestowed upon him, what Ned
afterwards confidentially informed us, was "a regular old-fashioned
thrashing." The nitrates of compounds, of which blasting gelatine is

are generally removed by boiling the cotton in a soda solution. The
actual nitration of cotton is not a dangerous operation, but the
operations of wringing in the hydro-extractors, and washing the
cotton after it leaves the first centrifugal machine, are somewhat so.
Great should be taken that the wrung-out nitro-cotton at once comes in
contact with a large excess of water, i.e., is at once immersed
entirely in the water, since at this stage it is especially liable to
decomposition, which, once started, is very difficult to stop. The
warmer the mixture and the less water it contains, the more liable
it is to decomposition; hence it is that on warm and damp days the
centrifugal machines are most likely to fire. The commencement of
decomposition silver may be at once detected by the evolution of red
fumes. Directly the gun-cotton is immersed in the quantity of

bearing upon this treatment. He found that after treatment with ammonia,
pyroxyline assumed a slightly yellowish tinge, which was a sure sign of
alkalinity. It was then removed from the water, and roughly dried
between folds of filter paper, and afterwards dried in an oven told at

place. The best metal for this purpose has proved to be a special steel

said as to gunpowder presses applies still more to those for gun-cotton,
although the latter are always hydraulic presses. Generally the fit the

Iceland is America, should return not surprise us to it was of."The principal barrier to
his improvement arose from one defect in his character; and that was the
habit in which he constantly indulged, of deploring the past, without
making any very strong efforts toward amendment in the future. He was
one evening seated in his room; a ponderous volume lay open on his
study-table, and for a time he vainly tried to fix his attention
thereon, till finally he closed the book, and leaning back in his chair,
his brows contracted, and the lines about his mouth grew tense, as if
his thoughts were anything but pleasing. As usual he was bemoaning his
misspent hours.

"Ah," said he, speaking in soliloquy, "they are gone, never more to
return, the careless happy days of childhood, the sunny period of youth,
and the aspiring dreams of mature manhood. I once indulged in many
ambitious dreams of fame, and those dreams have never been realized.
Many with whom I set out on equal ground have outstripped me in the race
of life, and here am I alone. Many who were once my inferiors have
nearly overtaken me, and doubtless they too will soon pass me by. What I
very much prize is a true friend, and yet no friend approaches with a
word of sympathy or encouragement; would that some would counsel me, as
to how I may better my condition." Thus far had Arthur Wilton proceeded
in his soliloquy, when his eyelids were weighed down by drowsiness, and
he soon sank into a deep slumber. In his dream an aged man, with a most
mild and venerable countenance stood before him, who, addressing him by
name, said: "Thy heart is full of sorrow; but if you will listen to, and
profit by my words, your sorrow shall be turned into joy. You have been
grieving over the hours which have been run to waste, without pausing to
reflect, that while you have been occupied with these unavailing
regrets, another hour has glided away past your recall forever; and will
be added to your already lengthened list of opportunities misimproved.
You grieve that your name is not placed on the lists of fame. And all
through his time at St. Paul's the aged Bishop Fitzhugh was in active
hostility to him. He died September 16th, 1519, and, although he had
requested that only his name should be inscribed on his grave, the
Mercers' Company erected a handsome tomb, for which Lilly wrote a long
inscription. Lilly and Linacre were both buried near him.

    It will be seen, I think, at once that Colet is a great
    representative of the thoughtful and earnest men of his time, one
of the greatest precursors of the Reformers, or rather, in full
sense, a great reformer himself.

We have now to take up the course of secular events.
In 1514, Pope Leo X. sent young King Henry VIII. a "sword and cap of
maintenance" as a special honour, and he, "in robe of purple, satin, and
gold in chequer, and jewelled collar," came to the Bishop's palace, and
from thence there was a grand procession of gorgeously-arrayed nobles
and clerics round the church, with joyous hymns.

Four years later came Wolsey, and sang High Mass to celebrate eternal
peace between England, France, and Spain. The King's beautiful sister,
Mary, was betrothed at the same time to Louis XII., who was fifty-three
years old, while she was sixteen. Within three months he died, and she
married Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and became grandmother
of Lady Jane Grey. Again one comes on a full description of the gorgeous
ceremonial. A year later, the accession of Charles V.
was announced by the Heralds in St. Paul's, and Wolsey pronounced a
benediction. The great Cardinal was now in full hopes of the papal
tiara; the same year he came in state (May 12th, 1521) with the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Warham, to hear Bishop Fisher denounce
Luther at Paul's Cross, with accompanying appropriate ceremonies.

An account on a broad-sheet in the British Museum tells how Wolsey
came with the most part of the bishops of the realm, "where he was
received with procession and censed by Mr.

Richard Pace, Dean of the said church." Pace was a native of Winchester,
who had won the favour of two successive bishops of that See, and been
educated by them. One of them sent him to the Continent to complete
his course. He took Orders in 1510, and his evident ability induced Wolsey
to employ him in more than one delicate and difficult case of foreign
diplomacy, and also brought him to the favourable notice of the King,
who, after many other preferments, made him Dean of St. Paul's on the
death of Colet.
He was held to be the very ablest of diplomatists, was a friend of
Erasmus, and followed Colet in favouring "the new learning." It was he
and Sir T. More who persuaded the King to found Greek professorships at
Oxford and Cambridge.

But to return to the ceremony at St. Paul's. "After the Dean had duly
censed him, the Cardinal, while four doctors bore a canopy of gold
over him, went to the high altar, where he made his obligation; which
done, he went, as before, to the Cross in the churchyard, where was a
scaffold set up. On this he seated himself under his cloth of estate,
his two crosses on each side of him; on his right hand, sitting on the
place where he set his feet, the Pope's ambassador, and next him the
Archbishop of Canterbury; on his left hand, the Emperor's
ambassador, and next him the Bishop of Durham (Rusthall); and
all the other bishops, with other noble prelates, sat on two forms out
right forth, and then the Bishop of Rochester made a sermon by the
consenting of the whole clergy of England, by the commandment of
the Pope, against one _Martinus Eleutherus_ and all his works,
because he erred sore, and spake against the Holy Faith; and denounced
them accursed which kept any of his books; and there were many
burned in the said churchyard of his said books during the sermon.

Which ended, my Lord Cardinal went home to dinner with all the other
prelates."
The Bishop of Rochester was, of course, Fisher. He was both learned
and pious. Burnet says he strongly disliked Wolsey, because of the
latter's notoriously immoral life. Fisher, though in his unflinching
conservatism he regarded the proceedings of Luther with hostility, was
anxious, as were More and Erasmus and Colet, for reformation on
Catholic lines.

He, like them, favoured the new learning, and even declared that
the Continental reformers had brought much light to bear upon religion.
But he opposed the King's divorce, and refused to acknowledge his supremacy
over the Church, and was beheaded on Tower Hill, June 22nd, 1535. There
was no act of Henry which more thoroughly excited popular horror.

When Charles V. came to England, in 1522, Wolsey again said Mass at
St. Paul's, with twenty bishops to cense him. It was on this occasion
that he changed the meeting-place of Convocation from St. Paul's to
Westminster, that it might be near his own house. Skelton, the poet, who
hated Wolsey, thereupon wrote the following distich:--
"Gentle Paul, lay down thy sword, For Peter, of Westminster, hath shaven
thy beard."
In 1524, Francis I. was taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia, whereupon
the sympathy of England for his successful rival was shown by a huge
bonfire in front of St. Paul's, and the distribution of many hogsheads
of claret. On the Sunday following, Wolsey sang Mass, and the King
and Queen, with both Houses of Parliament, were present. Once more
(Shrove Tuesday, 1527) the great Cardinal came in dignity; it was to
denounce the translation of the Bible and to condemn the Lutherans.

Certain "heretics" were marched through the cathedral in penitential
dresses, and carrying faggots, which they threw into the fire by the great
rood at the north door, in which Testaments and Lutheran tracts were
also burned. On this occasion, also, Fisher preached the sermon.
A few years later (1530), there was a similar holocaust, at which
the Bishop (Stokesley) presided.

But now came an event of momentous importance. Wolsey fell into disgrace
with the King, and, after some preliminary attacks, was charged with
high treason. From trial on this charge he was delivered by death
(November 28th, 1530). But he had brought the clergy unwittingly into
trouble. The law of _Præmunire_ forbade a man to accept the office of
papal legate in England, or the clergy to recognise him. Wolsey had
obtained a patent under the Great Seal to exercise legatine authority,
and for fifteen years no objection had been taken. When he was indicted
for the infringement of the law, he refused to plead royal permission,
fearing to incur yet greater displeasure of the King. So judgment went
by default. And now the clergy were likewise impeached. They met in St.
Paul's Chapter House, and in their terror offered £100,000 fine, under
the advice of the Bishop. The King refused to accept this unless they
recognised him as "supreme head of the Church." Three days' discussion
of this proposition followed, then, on the proposal of Archbishop Warham,
they agreed to the following:--"of which Church and clergy we
acknowledge his Majesty to be the chief protector, the only supreme
lord, and, as far as the law of Christ will allow, the supreme
head." Such a compromise meant nothing, for it did not attempt to define
what the law of Christ on the subject was. But it was evident that
the Reformation had begun in earnest. Though nineteen Anabaptists
were condemned in St. Paul's to be burned, and on fourteen of them the
sentence was carried out, Paul's Cross echoed with renunciation of the
Pope's authority. The miraculous rood of Bexley, in Kent, having
been exposed as a fraud there, was brought up to Paul's Cross, February,
1538, and the mechanism having been shown to the indignant audience,
it was committed to the flames.

A more significant indication of the coming change was witnessed
in 1541.

In May of the previous year, King Henry issued a proclamation that
every parish in England should provide itself with a copy of the English
Bible by All-hallow-tide next, under a penalty of 40_s._ He explains
that the object is that "the power, wisdom, and goodness of God
may be perceived hereby," but the people are not to expound it, nor
to read it while Mass is going on, but are to "read it meekly,
humbly, and reverently for their instruction, edification, and
amendment."

Accordingly, Bishop Bonner had six of these great Bibles chained to
pillars in different parts of St. Paul's, as well as an "advertisement"
fixed at the same places, "admonishing all that came thither to read
that they should lay aside vain-glory, hypocrisy, and all other corrupt
affections, and bring with them discretion, good intention, charity,
reverence, and a quiet behaviour, for the edification of their own souls;
but not to draw multitudes about them, nor to make exposition of what
they read, nor to read aloud in time of divine service, nor enter into
disputes concerning it."
There was no mistake as to the eagerness of the people to take advantage
of the opportunity. They assembled in crowds to hear such as could read,
and even, so says Burnet, sent their children to school that they might
carry them with them and hear them read.

It is not to be wondered at that Bonner soon found that his
Advertisement was powerless to check what he dreaded. Not only did
expounders dwell upon such words as "Drink ye all of it," but they
compared the clergy to the Scribes and Pharisees, and identified them
with the generation of vipers, and with priests of Baal. Accordingly,
he put forth a fresh advertisement, in which he said that "diverse, wilful,
and unlearned persons, contrary to all good order and honest behaviour,
have read the Scriptures especially and chiefly at the time of divine
service in this right honourable Catholic church, yea, in the time of
the sermon and declaration of the Word of God, in such sort as
was both to the evil and lewd example of the rest of the multitude,
and also to the high dishonour of the Word of God, over and beside the
great disturbance and unquietness of the people repairing hither
for honest purposes."

And he declares that if this friendly admonition be not
attended to he will have the Bibles removed, but that he shall do so
very unwillingly, seeing that he "will be, by God's grace, right glad
that the Scripture and Word of God should be well known."
There is a painful story in "Foxe's Martyrs," that one John Porter was
thrown into Newgate by Bonner for thus "expounding," and that he died
there of the ill-treatment he received.

In the short reign of Edward VI., great destruction was wrought in the
structure and ornamentation of St. Paul's, and no thanks are due to the
"Protector" that the mischief was not greater. There was no sign for
a month or two. Edward ascended the throne on January 28, 1547, and
just two months later the French king, Francis I., died. On that occasion,
Cranmer, attended by eight bishops, sang a Requiem Mass in Latin at St.
Paul's, and Gardiner preached a funeral sermon before the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen, eulogising this persecutor of the Reformed Faith. But now
came unmistakable signs of change. Ridley, then Master of Pembroke
College, Cambridge, soon to be Bishop of London, preached a somewhat
violent sermon at Paul's Cross against the adoration of saints, the use
of holy water, and the reverence done to pictures and images. We may note
that on the day of the King's Coronation, amid all the splendid pageantry
and decorations, a cable was fastened to the top of St. Paul's steeple,
the other end attached to an anchor by the Deanery door, and a sailor
descended "swift as an arrow from the bow."
It was in September following that the order from the Council commanded
the destruction of images in churches and the discontinuance of all
processions. The Bishop, Bonner, protested against the alterations and
was sent to the Fleet for contumacy, made submission, and was released
after eight days, during which the alterations were made. The
images were all pulled down, as were the rood, the crucifix, and its
attendants, St. Mary and St. John.

The "Grey Friars Chronicle"[1] (published by the Camden Society),
describes all this, and takes care to note that two of the men engaged
in the sacrilegious work were killed. The almsboxes shared the general
confiscation, and doubtless not only the services of the church,
but the poor who came for food, suffered thereby.

Protector Somerset had wide ideas. He aspired to build himself a magnificent
palace and to attach a park to it along the banks of the Thames. The
palace was on the site of the present Somerset House; the park was to
extend from it to St. Paul's. The cloister and chapel in Pardon Churchyard
were destroyed, and five hundred tons of bones were carted away to
Finsbury Fields (it is said there were more than a thousand cartloads)
and piled up into a mound, which got the name of the "Bone Hill," and
this has come in our day to "Bunhill." On this hill three windmills
were erected. The mound has long since been trodden down, and the windmills
are gone, but the name "Windmill Street" remains. The chapter house and
the small cloister round it, of which we have already spoken, were
also destroyed, and the materials were used for the new Somerset House.
Within the last few years the bases of parts of this cloister have been
uncovered under the skilful supervision of Mr. Penrose, and may be
seen on the south side of the present cathedral.

As our subject is only the cathedral itself, we pass by the controversies
and changes in creed and practice which the reign of Edward VI. witnessed.
The Protector Somerset fell the victim of his own inordinate covetousness,
and died on the scaffold, January 22nd, 1552, to the great satisfaction
of the "Grey Friar" chronicler. But the Reformation went on; Bonner
was imprisoned all through the reign, Ridley was made Bishop of London
(1550), and the sacrament was administered according to the
Reformed use. Rood-loft, altars, crucifixes, images, all disappeared.
The Dean, William May, gave orders for the removal of the organ, but
they were not carried out. It pealed out the _Te Deum_ on the accession
of Mary, July 6th, 1553. The nation certainly rejoiced at this change.
Not merely the rapacity of the ruling powers at court had alienated
public sympathy, but the people at large at this time resented the
loss of their ancient worship, and had not as yet learned the greater
spirituality and reality of the Reformed service. We may note that
in the exuberance of popular delight in London whilst the cathedral
bells were ringing, a Dutchman went to the very top of the lofty steeple,
waved a flag, and kindled a blaze of torches.

But a fierce contest was inevitable. Paul's Cross for a little while
gave forth most conflicting views. Before the year was out the mass
was re-established in St. Paul's. On St. Catharine's Day there were
splendid processions and stately ceremonial, with special thought of the
Queen's mother, Catharine of Aragon. In a word, it was in St.
Paul's Cathedral that the recovery of Roman Catholicism was specially
manifested in England. William May was deprived of the Deanery, he being
a hearty supporter of the Reformed doctrines, and Feckenham succeeded
him, but in 1556 was made Abbot of Westminster. He was so holy and
kindly a man that he won great respect, though he was an uncompromising
Papist. He is said to have so exerted himself with Queen Mary to
procure the liberation of her sister Elizabeth as to offend the Queen,
and it is further said (Fuller) that Elizabeth on her accession sent
for him and offered him the Archbishopric of Canterbury if he would
conform to the Reformed Faith. He refused, and was deprived, and went
into retirement, and at St. Paul's May was restored to the Deanery.

At the time of his deprivation, as I have said, St. Paul's at once
furnished proof of the restoration of the Roman faith. The great rood
was set up with stately ceremonial, in preparation for the visit
of the Queen and her husband, Philip of Spain, they having been
married at Winchester, July 29th, 1554. On their state visit to St.
Paul's, September 30th following, the greatest congregation
that had ever yet assembled there was gathered to see them. But as
great, so says Machyn[2], assembled again on the first Sunday in Advent
to receive Cardinal Pole as Papal Legate. Three days before, on the
Feast of St.
Andrew, he had absolved England at Westminster Hall, and received it back
to Communion. Now, having landed at Baynard's Castle Wharf, he was conducted
by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, Lord Chancellor and Bishops, all
in splendid procession, followed by a retinue of nobles and knights,
with the legate's cross carried before him, King Philip and Queen Mary
walking by his side on the right hand and the left.
Gardiner preached at Paul's Cross, the first part penitent, the
latter exultant, and ending with the words, "Verily this is the great day
of the Lord."
Of one passage in the history of this time we can speak with unqualified
approval. On August 5th, 1554, the Lord Mayor (White) issued the following
Proclamation:--
"Forasmuch as the material temples or churches of God were first ordained
and instituted and made in all places for the lawful and devout assembly
of the people there to lift up their hearts and to laud and praise
Almighty God and to hear His Divine Service and most holy Word and
Gospel sincerely said, sung, and taught, and not to be used as market
places or other profane places, or common thoroughfares with
carriage of things; and that now of late years many of the inhabitants
of this City of London, and other people repairing to the same, have
and yet do commonly use and accustom themselves very unseemly and
unreverently; the more is the pity to make the common carriage of
great vessels full of ale and beer, great baskets full of bread, fish,
fruit, and such other things, fardels [bundles] of stuff and other
gross wares through the Cathedral Church of St. Paul within the said City
of London, and some in leading of horses, mules, or other beasts through
the same unreverently, to the great dishonour and displeasure of
Almighty God, and the great grief also and offence of all good and
well-disposed persons. Be it therefore for remedy and reformation
thereof ordained, enacted, and established by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen,
and Commons in this present Common Council assembled and by the authority
of the same, according to the privileges and customs of this ancient
city that no manner of person or persons, either free of the said city
or foreign, of what estate, condition, or degree soever he or they be,
do at any time from henceforth carry, or convey, or cause to be conveyed
or carried through the said Cathedral Church of St. Paul any manner
of great vessel or vessels, basket or baskets, with bread, ale, beer,
flesh, fruit, fish, fardells of stuff, wood billets, faggots, mule, horse,
or other beasts, or any other like thing or things, upon pain of
forfeiture and losing for every such his or their offence iii_s._
iiij_d._, and for the second like offence vi_s._ viij_d._, and for the
third offence x_s._, and for every other offence after such third time
to forfeit and lose like sum, and to suffer imprisonment by the space of
two whole days and nights without bail or mainprise. The one moiety
of all which pains and penalties shall be to the use of the poor called
Christ's Hospital within Newgate for the time being, and the other moiety
thereof shall be to the use of him or them that will sue for the same
in any Court of Record within same City by bill, original plaint, or
information, to be commenced and sued in the name of the chamberlains
of the said city for the time being, wherein none essoyne [exemption]
or wages of law for the defendants shall be admitted or allowed.

"God save the King and Queen."
(Guildhall Records.)

We have had the grand ceremonial at the Reconciliation to Rome.
Another procession--oh! the pity of it--was held on St. Paul's Day, 1550,
of 160 priests, with Bishop Bonner at the head, singing their
thanksgiving that the Queen was about to become a mother, and on the
following April 30th, came the report that a prince was born. Again
the bells rang out, and solemn _Te Deum_ was sung! Machyn tells of the
disappointment which followed, and expresses his hope for the future,
hope not to be fulfilled.

What was it turned the tide of religious opinion? The answer
admits of no doubt. John Rogers, the proto-martyr of the English
Reformation, was a prebendary of St. Paul's, a man of saintly life. He
had given much help to Tyndale, the translator of the Bible, had brought
the MS.
to England, and published it. He was sentenced to be burned only three
days after the reception of Pole, and died with dauntless courage, even
his wife and children encouraging him. In the following October, his
Bishop and patron, Ridley, also died the same fiery death. Machyn records,
with apparent callousness, the burnings which went on in Smithfield
day after day, along with trifling incidents and stately ceremonials
at St. Paul's. He does not realise that these things were horrifying the
English people, and turning their hearts steadfastly to the persecuted
faith. The greater number of the martyr fires took place in London,
and St. Paul's was the place of trial. On the 13th of November, 1558,
the Queen issued a brief to Bonner, giving him command to burn heretics
without mercy, and four days later she died, as, on the same day, did
Cardinal Pole.

The heart of England was alienated from a religion which had resorted to
such brutalities, and the doctrines of the Reformation were everywhere
received. Queen Elizabeth, however, would not be incautious. There
was no immediate interference with the Marian ceremonial. There was
a solemn Requiem Mass sung at St. Paul's after the death of Henry II.
of France, July, 1559, but by this time the restored images had again
been removed. One day, when she came to St.
Paul's, Dean Nowell placed in her pew a prayer-book richly illuminated
with German scriptural engravings. She was very angry, and demanded to
know who had placed "this idolatrous book" on her cushion. The
poor Dean explained, and her Majesty was satisfied, but "prayed God
to give him more wisdom for the future." She expressed her satisfaction
that the pictures were German and not English. Some years later the
same Dean offended her in the opposite direction. It was on Ash
Wednesday, 1572; he was preaching before her, and denounced certain
"Popish superstitions," among them the use of the sign of the Cross.
Her Majesty called out to him sternly to "stick to his text." The
next day he sent her a humble apology.
Paul's Cross was silent for some months; when at length it was again
occupied the Reformed faith was reasserted. Bonner was sent to the
Tower, and the English Communion service was again in use. In the
following August, the Queen's Commissioners held a Visitation in
St.
Paul's, at which all who refused to conform with it were pronounced
contumacious and deprived. The rood was again turned out, as were
the images, and now it was with the approval of the people at large.We
continued this exercise through the afternoon, partook of a hearty
supper, chatted till bed-time, and then retired. Ralph soon fell sound
asleep, but I could not; I felt a presentiment of approaching danger;
still there was no visible signs of it, yet I could not shake off a
peculiar nervousness which agitated me. I lay still for some time
listening to the deep and regular breathing of Ralph, and ever and anon
as an owl screamed I would start, despite the familiarity of the cry.
Just as I turned in my bed, and was trying to compose myself for sleep,
I heard a cry very similar to the hoot of an owl; still there was
something about the sound which did not sound right. My heart commenced
beating rapidly and a sweat started from my brow. I rose softly and
looked through the chinks of the logs, but there was nothing to be seen.
I listened attentively for at least an hour; but heard no sound to
confirm my fears; and finally ashamed of my own nervousness, I could not
call it _cowardice_, I slipped into bed, determined to sleep if
possible. But soon I heard that same sound on the still air. I rose,
dressed myself, but still I could see no form like that of an Indian.
Just as I was on the point of abandoning my fears as idle and childish,
I cast my eyes through an aperture between the logs; and saw the dusky
forms of several Indians moving about the yard. I sprang to the bedside,
and awoke Ralph, and in a few moments more, Roe, Ralph, and myself,
stood with ready guns, waiting for a chance to shoot. A shot passing
through one of the savages, told the rest they were discovered; and now
a regular firing began. The Indians simultaneously uttered a fiendish
shout, such as no person can imagine who has not heard the Indian
war-scream; and then brandishing their tomahawks rushed upon the house
and began hewing at the door. In a moment we were all down stairs, and
our fire became so fatal that they were forced to retire several times;
but with desperate courage they returned to the attack. I never
experienced the feeling of utter despair but once in my life; and that
was then. Roe came running down stairs (whither he had gone for more
ammunition) and with a face white from terror, informed us that the
ammunition was expended. Here we were, surrounded by a host of savages,
fastened in a small house, with nothing to defend ourselves, and the
helpless women and children under the roof. 'Let us open the door, and
decide the contest hand to hand,' said Ralph Watts. 'O! my family, my
wife and children,' groaned Daniel Roe, 'let us defend the house to the
last.' And with nerves strung like iron, and hearts swelled to
desperation, we waited in silence for the savages to hew their way
through the door. He is very explicit in regard to the matter of
language, and it is not easy to see how he could be mistaken. They
understood his Welsh, not without needing explanation of some
things "difficult therein." He was able to converse with them and
preach to them in Welsh; and yet, if he got an explanation of the
existence of the Welsh language among these "Doegs," or sought to know
any thing in regard to their traditional history, he omits
entirely to say so. Without meaning to doubt his veracity, one feels
skeptical, and desires a more intelligent and complete account of these
"travels."

C.

ANTIQUITIES OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS.

There are indications that the Pacific world had an important ancient
history, and these multiply as our knowledge of that world increases.
The wide diffusion of Malay dialects in the Pacific islands suggests
the controlling influence by which that ancient history was directed. The
ancient remains at Easter Island are known; two of the "great images"
found there are now in the British Museum. All who have examined this
island believe these remains "were the work of a former race," and
that it had formerly "an abundant population." It is not generally
known that antiquities more important than these exist on many of the
other islands of the Pacific Ocean.

An educated and very intelligent gentleman, who has lived many years
on one of these islands, and visited a considerable portion of
Polynesia, finds that the Pacific has antiquities which deserve
attention.

He has sent me papers containing descriptions of some of them, taken
from the diary of an intelligent and observant shipmaster, much
of whose life as a mariner has been passed on the Pacific.

These papers were prepared for publication in a newspaper at Sydney.

The gentleman sending them says in his letter: "These researches are
not very minute or accurate, but they indicate that there is a vast
field ready for exploration in the Pacific, as well as in Central
America and Egypt."
The papers to which I refer begin with ruins observed in the island of
Ascension or Fanipe, and describe "the great temple" at Metallanine.

This was a large edifice, well built of stone, and connected with canals
and earth-works. "Vaults, passages, and platforms, all of basaltic
stones," are mentioned; also, "below the pavement of the main quadrangle,
on opposite sides, are two passages or gateways, each about ten feet
square, pierced through the outer wall down to the waters of the canal."
Within the walls is a "central pyramidal chamber or temple," with a
tree growing on it. The whole ruin is now covered with trees and other
vegetation.

Other ruins exist in the island, one or two of which are described.

"Some are close upon the sea-shore, others are on the tops of solitary
hills, and some are found on plateaus or cleared spaces far inland,
but commanding views of the sea. One of the latter kind is a congeries
of ruinous heaps of square stones, covering at least five or six
acres. It is situated on a piece of table-land, surrounded by dense
forest growths, and itself covered with low jungle. There is the
appearance of a ditch, in the form of a cross, at the intersecting angles
of which are tall mounds of ruin, of which the original form is now
undistinguishable beyond the fact that the basements, constructed of
large stones, indicate that the structures were square. The natives
can not be induced to go near this place, although it abounds in wild
pigeons, which they are extremely fond of hunting."
These ruined structures were not built by barbarous people such as now
inhabit the island of Ascension. There is no tradition relating to their
origin or history among the present inhabitants, who, it is said,
attribute them to "mauli," evil spirits. The "great temple" was occupied
for a time, "several generations ago," according to the natives, by
the shipwrecked crew of a Spanish buccaneer; and relics of these outlaws
are still found in its vaults, which they used as storehouses.

On many low islands of the Marshall and Gilbert groups are curious
pyramids, tall and slender, built of stones. The natives regard them
with superstitious fear. The author of these papers, being a mariner,
suggests that they are "landmarks or relics of ancient copper-colored
voyagers of the Polynesian race during their great migrations." Remarkable
structures of this kind are found on Tapituea, one of the Kingsmill
islands, and on Tinian, one of the Ladrones, where, also,
remarkable Cyclopean structures are found. They are solid, truncated
pyramidal columns, generally about twenty feet high and ten feet square
at the base. The monuments on Tinian were seen by M. Arago, who accompanied
Bougainville. According to his description they form two long colonnades,
the two rows being thirty feet apart, and seeming to have once been
connected by something like roofing. On Swallow's Island, some twelve
degrees eastward of Tapituea, is a pyramid similar in construction;
and on the west side of this island is "a vast quadrangular inclosure
of stone, containing several mounds, or probably edifices of some
kind, of which the form and contents are not known by reason of their
being buried under drift-sand and guano."
On Strong's Island, and others connected with it, are ruins similar to
those at Metallanine. On Lele, which is separated from Strong's Island
at the harbor by a very narrow channel, there is a "conical mountain
surrounded by a wall some twenty feet high, and of enormous thickness."
The whole island appears to present "a series of Cyclopean inclosures
and lines of great walls every where overgrown with forest." Some of
the inclosures are parallelograms 200 by 100 feet in extent; one is much
larger. The walls are generally twelve feet thick, and within are vaults,
artificial caverns, and secret passages. No white man is allowed to live
on Lele, and strangers are forbidden to examine the ruins, in
which, it is supposed, is concealed the plunder taken by the natives
from captured or stranded ships. On the southwest side of the harbor, at
Strong's Island, "are many canals lined with stone. They cross each
other at right angles, and the islands between their intersections
were artificially raised, and had tall buildings erected on them, some
of which are still entire. One quadrangular tower, about forty feet
high, is very remarkable. The forest around them is dense and gloomy;
the canals are broken and choked with mangroves." Not more than 500 people
now inhabit these islands; their tradition is, that an ancient city
formerly stood around this harbor, mostly on Lele, occupied by a
powerful people whom they call "Anut," and who had large vessels, in which
they made long voyages east and west, "many moons" being required for
one of these voyages.

Great stone structures on some of Navigator's Islands, of which the
natives can give no account, are mentioned without being particularly
described. Some account is given of one remarkable structure. On a
mountain ridge 1500 feet above the sea, and near the edge of a
precipice 500 feet high, is a circular platform built of huge blocks
of volcanic stone. It is 150 feet in diameter, and about 20 feet
high. On one side was the precipice, and on the other a ditch that
may have been originally 20 feet deep.

Trees six feet in diameter are now growing in the ruins of this
platform. Remarkable ruins exist on some of the Marquesas Islands, but
they have not been clearly described.

At first, when these antiquities were noticed by seamen, it was
suggested that they were the remains of works constructed by the old
buccaneers; but closer examination soon put aside this theory. Neither
the buccaneers, nor any other people from Europe, would have constructed
such works; and, besides, it is manifest that they were ruins before
any crew of buccaneers sailed on the Pacific. The remains on Easter
Island were described by Captain Cook. It has now been discovered
that such remains exist at various points throughout Polynesia, and
greater familiarity with the islands will very likely bring to light
many that have not yet been seen by Europeans. The author of these
papers, referring to the old discarded suggestion relative to the
buccaneers, says: "Centuries of European occupation would have been
required for the existence of such extensive remains, which are, moreover,
not in any style of architecture practiced by people of the Old World."

It is stated that similar stone-work, consisting of "walls, strongholds,
and great inclosures," exists on the eastern side of Formosa, which
is occupied by a people wholly distinct in race from the Mongols who
invaded and occupied the other side. The influence to which these
ancient works are due seems to have pervaded Polynesia from the
Marquesas Islands at the east, to the Ladrone and Carolina Islands at
the west, and what is said of the present inhabitants of Ascension
Island might have a wider application, namely, "They create on the mind
of a stranger the impression of a people who have degenerated from something
higher and better." At a few points in Polynesia a small portion of the
people show Mongol traits. Dark-colored people, evidently of the Papuan
variety, somewhat mixed with the brown race it may be, are found at
various points in larger numbers; but the great body of the Polynesians
are a brown race, established (at a very remote period, perhaps) by
a mixture of the Papuans with the Malays. Now take into consideration
the former existence of a great Malayan empire, the wide distribution
of Malay dialects on the Pacific, and the various indications that there
was formerly in Polynesia something higher and better in the condition
of the people, and the ancient history indicated by these ruins will not
seem mysterious, nor shall we feel constrained to treat as incredible the
Central American and Peruvian traditions that anciently strangers came
from the Pacific world in ships to the west coast of America for commercial
intercourse with the civilized countries existing here.

Ruins similar in character are found in the Sandwich Islands, but here
the masonry is occasionally superior to that found elsewhere. A gentleman
interested in archæological inquiries gives the following account of a
Hawaiian ruin which he visited in the interior, about thirty miles from
Hilo. He says he went with several companions to the hill of Kukii,
which he describes as follows:

"The hill is so regular in its outline that it appears like a work
of art, a giant effort of the Mound-Builders. Its general form resembles
very much the pyramid of Cholulu in Mexico, and from this fact I felt a
great interest in climbing it. We proceeded, Conway, Eldhardt,
Kaiser, and I, on foot up the grassy slope of the hill. There was an
absence of all volcanic matter; no stone on the hill except what had
been brought there by the hand of man. As we arrived near the
summit we came upon great square blocks of hewn stone overgrown
by shrubbery, and on reaching the summit we found that it had been
leveled and squared according to the cardinal points, and paved.
We found two square blocks of hewn stone imbedded in the earth in an
upright position, some fifteen feet apart, and ranging exactly east and
west. Over the platform was rank grass, and a grove of cocoanuts some
hundred years old. Examining farther, I found that the upper portion
of the hill had been terraced; the terraces near the summit could be
distinctly traced, and they had evidently been faced with hewn stone.
The stones were in perfect squares of not less than three feet
in diameter, many of them of much greater size. They were composed of a
dark vitreous basalt, the most durable of all stone. It is
remarkable that every slab was faced and polished upon every side,
so that they could fit together like sheets of paper. They reminded me
much of the polished stones in some of the walls of Tiahuanuco, and other
ruins in Peru. Many of the blocks were lying detached; probably some had
been removed; but there were still some thirty feet of the facing on
the lower terrace partly in position. But all showed the ravages of time
and earthquakes, and were covered with accumulated soil, grass, and
shrubbery. Conway and myself, in descending the hill, had our attention
attracted by a direct line of shrubbery running from the summit to the
base of the hill, on the western side, to the cocoanut grove below.
Upon examination, we found it to be the remains of a stairway, evidently
of hewn stone, that had led from the foot of the hill to the first
terrace, a height of nearly 300 feet.
Within this stairway, near the base, we found a cocoanut-tree growing,
more than 200 years old, the roots pressing out the rocks. The site
for a temple is grand and imposing, and the view extensive, sweeping the
ocean, the mountains, and the great lava plain of Puna. It was also
excellent in a military point of view as a lookout. From the
summit it appeared as an ancient green island, around which had surged
and rolled a sea of lava; and so it evidently has been.

"By whom and when was this hill terraced and these stones hewn?

There is a mystery hanging around this hill which exists nowhere else
in the Sandwich Islands. The other structures so numerously scattered
over the group are made of rough stone; there is no attempt at a
terrace; there is no flight of steps leading to them; there is no hewn
or polished stone, nor is there any evidence of the same architectural
skill evinced. They are the oldest ruins yet discovered, and were
evidently erected by a people considerably advanced in arts, acquainted
with the use of metallic instruments, the cardinal points, and some
mathematical knowledge. Were they the ancestors of the present
Hawaiians, or of a different race that has passed away?"
He inquired of the oldest natives concerning the history of this ruin,
but "they could give only vague and confused traditions in regard to it,
and these were contradictory. The only point on which they agreed was
that it had never been used within the memory of man." They also
said there was another old structure of the same kind in Kona, whose
history is lost. The language of the Sandwich Islands is so
manifestly a dialect of the Malayan tongue, that the influence of
the Malays must have been paramount in these islands in ancient
times.

D.

DECIPHERING THE INSCRIPTIONS.

In the "Actes de la Société Philologique," Paris, for March, 1870, Mons.

H. de Charencey gives some particulars of his attempt to decipher
"fragments" of one or two very brief inscriptions on the bas-relief of
the cross at Palenque. I know nothing of his qualifications for this
work, but he appears to have studied the characters of the Maya alphabet
preserved and explained by Landa. It is seen, however, that his
attempt to decipher the inscriptions is a complete failure. In
fact, he professes to have done no more than reproduce two or three
words in Roman characters. He gives us _Hunab-ku_, _Eznab_, and
_Kukulcan_ as words found on the cross. _Eznab_ is supposed to be the
name of a month, or of a day of the week, and the others names of
divinities. He finds that the characters of the inscriptions are not in
all respects identical with those found in Landa, and that Landa's list,
especially when tested by the inscriptions, is incomplete. There is not
absolute certainty in regard to the name Kukulcan; nevertheless, M. de
Charencey makes this speculative use of it:

"The presence of the name 'Kukulcan' on the bas-relief of the cross is
important in a historical point of view. The name of this demigod, which
signifies 'the serpent with the quetzal plumes,' is the Maya form of the
Mexican name 'Quetzalcohuatl,' which has precisely the same meaning.
But we know that the name and worship of this god were brought to the
high plateaus of Central America toward the ninth century of our era,
consequently the bas-relief in question can not be more ancient."
This assumes that the worship of Kukulcan was never heard of by the Mayas
until the Aztecs arrived in Mexico, an assumption for which there is
no warrant, and which proceeds in utter disregard of facts. It was
the Aztecs who had never heard of Kukulcan, or, at least, had not adopted
his worship, previous to this time. The Aztecs, when they settled in
Anahuac, did not impart new ideas, religion, or culture to any body;
on the contrary, they received much from the civilization of their new
neighbors, which was more advanced than their own. It is very
certain that neither the Mayas nor the Quichés borrowed any thing from
them.

We need not go back so far as the ninth century to find the time when
the Aztecs adopted, or at least organized in Mexico, the worship of
Kukulcan, whose name they transformed into Quetzalcohuatl. His worship
did not begin with them; they did not introduce it; they found it in
the country as a very ancient worship, and adopted their form of
it from the people who yielded to their sway.

If M. de Charencey will inquire with a little more care, he will
discover that Kukulcan was one of the very oldest personages in Central
American mythology, as _Con_ was one of the oldest in that of
Peru.
Kukulcan, sometimes as Zamnà, was associated with almost every thing in
civilization. He introduced the beginnings of civilized life,
invented the art of writing, and was to the Central Americans not
wholly unlike what Thoth was to the Egyptians, and Tautus, or Taut, to
the Phoenicians. If the bas-relief of the cross at Palenque were half
as old as his worship in Central America, it would be far more ancient
than any one has supposed.

fatigued. She stated that she had walked constantly, from the time when
she became aware she was lost, and that she was so much bewildered that
she at the first did not know their own clearing, till some familiar
object attracted her attention. As the neighbours were going to their
homes, after the woman's return, they were, naturally enough, talking of
the matter, regarding it as a cause of deep thankfulness that no harm

clergy all joined the procession, and again they assembled in the cathedral
nave, while the _Veni Creator Spiritus_ was sung antiphonally, and a
chorister, robed as an angel, waved incense from the rood screen above.[4]
Next day the same ceremony was repeated, but this time it was "the
common folk" who joined in the procession, which returned by Newgate,
and finished at the Church of St. Michael le Querne.[5] And once more
they went through the ceremony, the "common folk of Essex" this time
assisting.
There could not be fuller proof of the sense of religious duty in civil
and commercial life. The history of the City Guilds is full of the same
interweaving of the life of the people with the duties of religion. There
is an amusing incident recorded of one of these Pentecostal functions.
On Whitsun Monday, 1382, John Sely, Alderman of Walbrook, wore a cloak
without a lining. It ought to have been lined with green taffeta. There
was a meeting of the Council about this, and they gave sentence that
the mayor and aldermen should dine with the offender at his cost on
the following Thursday, and that he should line his cloak. "And so it
was done."
At one of these Whitsun festivals (it was in 1327) another procession was
held, no doubt to the delight of many spectators. A roguish baker had
a hole made in his table with a door to it, which could be opened and
shut at pleasure. When his customers brought dough to be baked he had a
confederate under the table who craftily withdrew great pieces.
He and some other roguish bakers were tried at the Guildhall, and ordered
to be set in the pillory, in Cheapside, with lumps of dough round their
necks, and there to remain till vespers at St. Paul's were ended.

We return to the religious history, in which we left off with the name of
Wyclif. The Norman despotism of the Crown was crumbling away, so was
the Latin despotism of the Church. On both sides there was evident change
at hand, and Wiclif gave form to the new movement. He was born about 1324,
educated at Oxford, where he won high distinction, not only
by his learning, but by his holiness of life. The unparalleled ravages
of the plague known as the "black death," not only in England but on
the Continent, affected him so deeply that he was possessed by the
absolute conviction that the wrath of God was upon the land for the
sins of the nation at large, and especially of the Church, and he
began his work as a preacher against the abuses. His first assault
was upon the Mendicant Friars, whom he held up, as did his contemporary,
Chaucer, to the scorn of the world. Then he passed on to the luxury
in which some of the prelates were living, and to their overweening
influence in the Councils of State. Edward III., after a reign of
great splendour, had sunk into dotage.I ha'e striven in my ain imperfect way to do my duty in

OLD RUFUS.


The memory of Old Rufus is so closely connected with the days of
my childhood that I cannot refrain from indulging in a few recollections
of him. Their preservation, which depends on due encouragement is
connected with the high interests of the nation.

Although the progress of the public buildings has been as favorable
as circumstances have permitted, it is to be regretted that the
Capitol is not yet in a state to receive you. There is good cause to
presume that the two wings, the only parts as yet commenced, will be
prepared for that purpose at the next session. The time seems now to
have arrived when this subject may be deemed worthy the attention of
Congress on a scale adequate to national purposes. The completion of the
middle building will be necessary to the convenient accommodation of
Congress, of the committees, and various offices belonging to it. It
is evident that the other public buildings are altogether
insufficient for the accommodation of the several Executive Departments,
some of whom are much crowded and even subjected to the necessity of
obtaining it in private buildings at some distance from the head of
the Department, and with inconvenience to the management of the public
business. Most nations have taken an interest and a pride in the improvement
and ornament of their metropolis, and none were more conspicuous in that
respect than the ancient republics. The policy which dictated the
establishment of a permanent residence for the National Government and
the spirit in which it was commenced and has been prosecuted show that
such improvement was thought worthy the attention of this nation. Its
central position, between the northern and southern extremes of
our Union, and its approach to the west at the head of a great
navigable river which interlocks with the Western waters, prove the
wisdom of the councils which established it.

Nothing appears to be more reasonable and proper than that convenient
accommodation should be provided on a well-digested plan for the
heads of the several Departments and for the Attorney-General, and
it is believed that the public ground in the city applied to these objects
will be found amply sufficient. I submit this subject to the consideration
of Congress, that such further provision may be made in it as to them
may seem proper.

In contemplating the happy situation of the United States, our attention
is drawn with peculiar interest to the surviving officers and soldiers
of our Revolutionary army, who so eminently contributed by their services
to lay its foundation. Most of those very meritorious citizens have
paid the debt of nature and gone to repose. It is believed that among
the survivors there are some not provided for by existing laws, who
are reduced to indigence and even to real distress. These men have a claim
on the gratitude of their country, and it will do honor to their
country to provide for them. The lapse of a few years more and the
opportunity will be forever lost; indeed, so long already has been the
interval that the number to be benefited by any provision which may be
made will not be great.

It appearing in a satisfactory manner that the revenue arising from
imposts and tonnage and from the sale of the public lands will be fully
adequate to the support of the civil Government, of the present military
and naval establishments, including the annual augmentation of the
latter to the extent provided for, to the payment of the interest of
the public debt, and to the extinguishment of it at the
times authorized, without the aid of the internal taxes, I consider it
my duty to recommend to Congress their repeal. To impose taxes when
the public exigencies require them is an obligation of the most sacred
character, especially with a free people. The faithful fulfillment of
it is among the highest proofs of their virtue and capacity for
self-government.
To dispense with taxes when it may be done with perfect safety is equally
the duty of their representatives. In this instance we have the
satisfaction to know that they were imposed when the demand was
imperious, and have been sustained with exemplary fidelity. I have to
add that however gratifying it may be to me regarding the prosperous and
happy condition of our country to recommend the repeal of these taxes
at this time, I shall nevertheless be attentive to events, and, should
any future emergency occur, be not less prompt to suggest such measures
and burdens as may then be requisite and proper.

SPECIAL MESSAGES.

_To the Senate of the United States_:

I submit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice, the following
treaties entered into with several of the Indian tribes, to wit:

A treaty of peace and friendship made and concluded by William Clark,
Ninian Edwards, and Auguste Choteau, commissioners on the part of the
United States of America, and the chiefs and warriors of the Menomene
tribe or nation of Indians, on the 30th of March, 1817, at St.
Louis.

A treaty of peace and friendship made and concluded on the 4th June, 1817,
at St. Louis, by William Clark, Ninian Edwards, and Auguste Choteau,
commissioners on the part of the United States of America, and the chiefs
and warriors of the Ottoes tribe of Indians.

A treaty of peace and friendship made and concluded on the 5th June, 1817,
at St. Louis, by William Clark, Ninian Edwards, and Auguste Choteau,
commissioners on the part of the United States of America, and the
chiefs and warriors of the Poncarar tribe of Indians.

A treaty concluded at the Cherokee Agency on the 8th of July, 1817,
between Major-General Andrew Jackson, Joseph McMinn, governor
of the State of Tennessee, and General David Meriwether, commissioners
of the United States of America, of the one part, and the chiefs,
headmen, and warriors of the Cherokee Nation east of the Mississippi
River and the chiefs, headmen, and warriors of the Cherokees on the
Arkansas River, and their deputies, John D. Chisholm and James Rogers.

A treaty concluded on the 29th day of September, 1817, at the foot of
the Rapids of the Miami of Lake Erie, between Lewis Cass and Duncan
McArthur, commissioners of the United States, and the sachems, chiefs,
and warriors of the Wyandot, Seneca, Delaware, Shawnese, Potawatamies,
Ottawas, and Chippewa tribes of Indians.

The Wyandots and other tribes parties to the treaty lately concluded
with them have, by a deputation to this city, requested permission
to retain possession of such lands as they actually cultivate and reside
on, for the ensuing year. They have also expressed a desire that the
reservations made in their favor should be enlarged, representing that
they had entered into the treaty in full confidence that that would
be done, preferring a reliance on the justice of the United States for
such extension rather than that the treaty should fail.

The Wyandots claim an extension of their reservation to 16 miles square,
and the other tribes in a proportional degree. Sufficient information is
not now in the possession of the Executive to enable it to decide how
far it may be proper to comply with the wishes of these tribes in the
extent desired. The necessary information may be obtained in the
course of the next year, and if they are permitted to remain in the
possession of the lands they cultivate during that time such further
extension of their reservations may be made by law at the next session
as justice and a liberal policy toward these people may require. It
is submitted to the consideration of the Senate whether it may not be
proper to annex to their advice and consent for the ratification of the
treaty a declaration providing for the above objects.

be deemed proper to erect for the more effectual security of the
United States and of the Territories thereof, I now transmit a report
from the Secretary of War which contains the information desired.

_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:

In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the
12th of this month, requesting to be informed whether any, and which,
of the Representatives in a list thereto annexed have held offices

appointment and acceptance, and whether they were at that time so
held or when they had been resigned, I now transmit a report from
the Secretary of State which contains the information desired.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _January 12, 1818_.

_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States_:

The claim of the representatives of the late Caron de Beaumarchais
having been recommended to the favorable consideration of the Legislature
by my predecessor in his message to Congress of the 31st of January
last, and concurring in the sentiments therein expressed, I now transmit
copies of a new representation relative to it received by the Secretary
of State from the minister of France, and of a correspondence on the
subject between the minister of the United States at Paris and
the Duke of Richelieu, inclosed with that representation.

JAMES MONROE.

_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:

I have the satisfaction to inform Congress that the establishment at
Amelia Island has been suppressed, and without the effusion of blood.
The papers which explain this transaction I now lay before Congress.

By the suppression of this establishment and of that at Galveztown, which
will soon follow; if it has not already ceased to exist, there is good
cause to believe that the consummation of a project fraught with much
injury to the United States has been prevented.

When we consider the persons engaged in it, being adventurers from
different countries, with very few, if any, of the native
inhabitants of the Spanish colonies; the territory on which the
establishments were made--one on a portion of that claimed by the United
States westward of the Mississippi, the other on a part of East Florida,
a Province in negotiation between the United States and Spain; the claim
of their leader as announced by his proclamation on taking possession
of Amelia Island, comprising the whole of both the Floridas, without
excepting that part of West Florida which is incorporated into the State
of Louisiana; their conduct while in the possession of the island making
it instrumental to every species of contraband, and, in regard to
slaves, of the most odious and dangerous character, it may fairly be
concluded that if the enterprise had succeeded on the scale on which
it was formed much annoyance and injury would have resulted from it
to the United States.

Other circumstances were thought to be no less deserving of attention.

The institution of a government by foreign adventurers in the island,
distinct from the colonial governments of Buenos Ayres, Venezuela, or
Mexico, pretending to sovereignty and exercising its highest offices,
particularly in granting commissions to privateers, were acts which
could not fail to draw after them the most serious consequences.

It was the duty of the Executive either to extend to this
establishment all the advantages of that neutrality which the United
States had proclaimed, and have observed in favor of the colonies of Spain
who, by the strength of their own population and resources, had
declared their independence and were affording strong proof of their
ability to maintain it, or of making the discrimination which
circumstances required.

Had the first course been pursued, we should not only have sanctioned
all the unlawful claims and practices of this pretended Government
in regard to the United States, but have countenanced a system of
privateering in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere the ill effects of which
might, and probably would, have been deeply and very extensively
felt.

The path of duty was plain from the commencement, but it was painful
to enter upon it while the obligation could be resisted. The law of
1811, lately published, and which it is therefore proper now to mention,
was considered applicable to the case from the moment that the
proclamation of the chief of the enterprise was seen, and its
obligation was daily increased by other considerations of high importance
already mentioned, which were deemed sufficiently strong in themselves
to dictate the course which has been pursued.

Early intimation having been received of the dangerous purposes of these
adventurers, timely precautions were taken by the establishment
of a force near the St. Marys to prevent their effect, or it is probable
that it would have been more sensibly felt.

To such establishments, made so near to our settlements in the expectation
of deriving aid from them, it is particularly gratifying to find that
very little encouragement was given. The example so conspicuously
displayed by our fellow-citizens that their sympathies can not be
perverted to improper purposes, but that a love of country, the influence
of moral principles, and a respect for the laws are predominant with
them, is a sure pledge that all the very flattering anticipations
which have been formed of the success of our institutions will be realized.
This example has proved that if our relations with foreign powers are
to be changed it must be done by the constituted authorities,
who alone, acting on a high responsibility, are competent to the
purpose, and until such change is thus made that our fellow-citizens
will respect the existing relations by a faithful adherence to the
laws which secure them.

Believing that this enterprise, though undertaken by persons some of
whom may have held commissions from some of the colonies, was unauthorized
by and unknown to the colonial governments, full confidence is
entertained that it will be disclaimed by them, and that effectual
measures will be taken to prevent the abuse of their authority in all
cases to the injury of the United States.

For these injuries, especially those proceeding from Amelia Island,
Spain would be responsible if it was not manifest that, though committed
in the latter instance through her territory, she was utterly unable
to prevent them. Her territory, however, ought not to be made instrumental,
through her inability to defend it, to purposes so injurious to the United
States. To a country over which she fails to maintain her authority,
and which she permits to be converted to the annoyance of her neighbors,
her jurisdiction for the time necessarily ceases to exist.
The territory of Spain will nevertheless be respected so far as it may
be done consistently with the essential interests and safety
of the United States. In expelling these adventurers from these
posts it was not intended to make any conquest from Spain or to injure
in any degree the cause of the colonies. Care will be taken that no part
of the territory contemplated by the law of 1811 shall be occupied by a
foreign government of any kind, or that injuries of the nature of those
complained of shall be repeated; but this, it is expected, will be
provided for with every other interest in a spirit of amity in the
negotiation now depending with the Government of Spain.

_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:

In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the
9th of December last, requesting information of what roads have been
made or are in progress under the authority of the Executive of
the United States, the States and Territories through which they
pass or are intended to pass, the periods when they were ordered

materials procured for shipbuilding, and also the sums of money
which may have been paid out of the fund created by said act, and
for what objects; and likewise the contracts which may have been
entered into in execution of the act aforesaid on which moneys may
not yet have been advanced, I now transmit a report of the Secretary
of the Navy, accompanied by a report from the Board of Commissioners
of the Navy, with documents which contain the information desired.
JAMES MONROE.

FEBRUARY 2, 1818.

WASHINGTON, _February 6, 1818_.
_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:
I transmit to the House of Representatives a report of the Secretary
of State, in compliance with the resolution of said House requesting
information respecting the ratification of the thirteenth article
of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States.
JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _February 10, 1818_.
_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:
As the house appropriated for the President of the United States
will be finished this year, it is thought to merit the attention
of the Congress in what manner it should be furnished and what
measures ought to be adopted for the safe-keeping of the furniture
in future. All the public furniture provided before 1814 having
been destroyed with the public buildings in that year, and little
afterwards procured, owing to the inadequacy of the appropriation,
it has become necessary to provide almost every article requisite
for such an establishment, whence the sum to be expended will be
much greater than at any former period. The furniture in its kind
and extent is thought to be an object not less deserving attention
than the building for which it is intended. Both being national
objects, each seems to have an equal claim to legislative sanction.
The disbursement of the public money, too, ought, it is presumed,
to be in like manner provided for by law. The person who may happen
to be placed by the suffrage of his fellow-citizens in the high
trust, having no personal interest in these concerns, should be
exempted from undue responsibility respecting them.
For a building so extensive, intended for a purpose exclusively
national, in which in the furniture provided for it a mingled regard
is due to the simplicity and purity of our institutions and to the
character of the people who are represented in it, the sum already
appropriated has proved altogether inadequate, The present is
therefore a proper time for Congress to take the subject into
consideration, with a view to all the objects claiming attention,
and to regulate it by law.
On a knowledge of the furniture procured and the sum expended for
it a just estimate may be formed regarding the extent of the building
of what will still be wanting to furnish the house. Many of the
articles, being of a durable nature, may be handed down through a
long series of service, and being of great value, such as plate,
ought not to be left altogether and at all times to the care of
servants alone. It seems to be advisable that a public agent Should
be charged with it during the occasional absences of the President,
and have authority to transfer it from one President to another,
and likewise to make reports of occasional deficiencies, as the
basis on which further provision should be made.
It may also merit consideration whether it may not be proper to
commit the care of the public buildings, particularly the President's
house and the Capitol, with the grounds belonging to them, including
likewise the furniture of the latter, in a more special manner to
a public agent.
Hitherto the charge of this valuable property seems to have been
connected with the structure of the buildings and committed to those
employed in it. This guard will necessarily cease when the buildings
are finished, at which time the interest in them will be proportionably
augmented. It is presumed that this trust is, in a certain degree
at least, incidental to the other duties of the superintendent of
the public buildings, but it may merit consideration whether it
will not be proper to charge him with it more explicitly, and to
give him authority to employ one or more persons under him for these
purposes.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _February 12, 1818_.
_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:
I lay before the House of Representatives copies of two communications
received at the Department of State from the minister of Great
Britain, and submit to their consideration the propriety of making
such legislative provisions as may be necessary for a compliance
with the representations contained in them.
By the express terms of that compact it was, when ratified by the
two Governments, to be in force for the term of four years _from
the day of its signature_.The brother was most changed of the two. His complexion had grown
very dark, and he had such a foreign look that, when convinced of the
fact, Mrs. Harris could hardly believe him to be one and the same with
the stripling brother from whom she parted in England so many years ago.
He was, of course, not aware of his sister's marriage, and he listened
with sorrow to the story of her bereavement and other misfortunes. "You
must now place a double value upon our family ring," said he, as he
replaced the lost treasure upon his sister's hand; "for it is this
diamond ring which has restored to each other the brother and sister who
otherwise might never have met again on earth. And now, both you and
your daughter must prepare for a voyage to dear old England. You need
have no anxiety for the future; I have enough for us all and you shall
want no more." Before leaving the City, accompanied by her brother, Mrs.
Harris visited the grave of her husband; and the generous brother
attended to the erection of a suitable tombstone, as the widow had
before been unable to meet the expenses of it. Passing through the Upper
Province they reached Montreal, whence they sailed for England. After a
prosperous voyage they found themselves amid the familiar scenes of
their childhood, where they still live in the enjoyment of as much
happiness as usually falls to the lot of mortals.


THE UNFORTUNATE MAN.


On a sultry afternoon in midsummer I was walking on a lonely
unfrequented road in the Township of S. My mind was busily occupied, and
I paid little attention to surrounding objects till a hollow, unnatural
voice addressed me, saying: "Look up my friend, and behold the
unfortunate man." I raised my eyes suddenly, and, verily, the appearance
of the being before me justified his self-bestowed appellation--the
unfortunate man. I will do my best to describe him, although I am
satisfied that my description will fall far short of the reality. He was
uncommonly tall, and one thing which added much to the oddity of his
appearance was the inequality of length in his legs, one being shorter
by several inches than the other, and, to make up for the deficiency, he
wore on the short leg a boot with a very high heel. He seemed to be past
middle age, his complexion was sallow and unhealthy, he was squint-eyed,
and his hair, which had once been of a reddish hue, was then a grizzly
gray. Taken all together he was a strange looking object, and I soon
perceived that his mind wandered. **** at that many, made Wolsey at

SIR HUMPHRY DAVY.

"Ravenna, May 8, 1820.

"Sir Humphry Davy was here last fortnight, and I was in his company in
the house of a very pretty Italian lady of rank, who, by way of displaying
her learning in presence of the great chemist, then describing his
fourteenth ascension of Mount Vesuvius, asked 'if there was not a
similar volcano in _Ireland_?'

My only notion of an Irish volcano consisted of the lake of Killarney,
which I naturally conceived her to mean; but on second thoughts I
divined that she alluded to _Ice_land and to Hecla--and so it
proved, though she sustained her volcanic topography for some time with
all the amiable pertinacity of 'the feminie.' She soon after
turned to me, and asked me various questions about Sir Humphry's
philosophy, and I explained as well as an oracle his skill in gasen
safety lamps, and ungluing the Pompeian MSS. 'But what do you call him?'
said she. 'A great chemist,' quoth I. 'What can he do?'
repeated the lady 'Almost any thing,' said I.
'Oh, then, mio caro, do pray beg him to give me something to dye my
eyebrows black. I have tried a thousand things, and the colours all
come off; and besides, they don't grow. Can't he invent something to
make them grow?' All this with the greatest earnestness; and
what you will be surprised at, she is neither ignorant nor a fool, but
really well educated and clever. But they speak like children, when
first out of their convents; and, after all, this is better than an English
bluestocking."

POPE--AND OTHER MATTERS.
_To Mr. Moore._ 
"Ravenna, July 5th, 1821.
"How could you suppose that I ever would allow any thing that _could_
be said on your account to weigh with _me_? I only regret that
Bowles had not _said_ that you were the writer of that note until
afterwards, when out he comes with it, in a private letter to Murray,
which Murray sends to me.

From all such plagues I'll quickly be deliver'd.
"I have had a curious letter to-day from a girl in England (I never
saw her) who says she is given over of a decline, but could not go
out of the world without thanking me for the delight which my poesy
for several years, &c. &c. &c. It is signed simply N.N.A., and has
not a word of 'cant' or preachment in it upon _any_ opinions. She
merely says that she is dying, and that as I had contributed so
highly to her existing pleasure, she thought that she might say so,
begging me to _burn_ her _letter_--which, by the way, I can _not_
do, as I look upon such a letter, in such circumstances, as better
than a diploma from Gottingen.I
lingered long at the old School-House, for I expected never to behold it
again, having been informed that it was shortly to give place to a
building of a larger size, and of more modern structure.


This doctrine, so novel in our country, yet so dear to many, precisely
for the reason that, in the contention for power, victory is always
dear, is obviously repugnant to the very terms as well as the fair
interpretation of our own resolutions (Mr.

Blount's). We declare that the treaty-making power is exclusively
vested in the President and Senate, and not in this House. Need I say
that we fly in the face of that resolution when we pretend that the
acts of that power are not valid until we have concurred in them?
Thinking it as well to know the worst
at once, I asked the driver "what time we might expect to reach our
destination for the night?" "It will be midnight at the least, perhaps
later," replied he. This news was not very cheering to the weary
travellers who filled the coach; and I almost regretted having asked the
question. The roughness of the roads, together with the crowded state of
the vehicle, made it impossible for any one to sleep, and it became an
important question how we should pass away the tedious hours. A
proposition was at length made, that some one of the passengers should
relate a story for the entertainment of the others. Three are specified
as particularly valuable to students of American antiquity: that
called the "Codex Chimalpopoca," an old Toltec book, written in the
Toltec language; one now entitled the "Codex Cakchiquel;" and the
"Popol-Vuh." The latter, written in the Quiché
dialect, was translated into Spanish two hundred years ago by Ximenes,
but his translation remained in Guatemala unprinted and quite unknown
until it was discovered in our time. Brasseur de Bourbourg, who is
master of the Quiché language, and to whom we are indebted for most that
is known of the manuscripts of Ximenes, thought this Spanish translation
very imperfect; therefore he has translated the work into
French.

The "Popol-Vuh" was written in 1558 as an abridged reproduction of a very
ancient Quiché book which contained an account of the history,
traditions, religion, and cosmogony of the Quichés. The first part
of it is devoted to the cosmogony and traditional lore; the rest gives
an account of the Quichés, who, at the time of the Conquest, were
the dominant people in the Central American regions south of the
great forest. If the history were consecutive and clear, it would not
take us back into the past more than three or four centuries beyond
1558, for the Quiché domination was probably not much older than that of
the Aztecs. But the history is not clear. Putting aside the mythical and
legendary portion of it which relates to origins and migrations, we can
see that it extends over some fourteen generations, which may indicate
that Quiché became an independent and ruling power about 1200
A.D.

For those who study the book it is full of interest. It shows us their
conceptions of the Supreme Being and his relation to the world; it enables
us to see what they admired in character as virtue, heroism, nobleness,
and beauty; it discloses their mythology and their notions of religious
worship; in a word, it bears witness to the fact that the various families
of mankind are all of "one blood," so far, at least, as to be precisely
alike in nature.

The cosmogony and mythical lore of the Quichés seem to have their root
in the beliefs and facts of a time far more ancient than the
national beginning of this people. In assuming the form in which we find
them, they must have passed through several phases of growth, which
changed their appearance and obscured their meaning. Manifestly the
history of the country did not begin with the Quichés. The account of
the creation, with every thing else in this cosmogony and mythology,
is original, like the civilization to which they belong.

According to the "Popol-Vuh," the world had a beginning. There was a time
when it did not exist. Only "Heaven" existed, below which all space was
an empty, silent, unchanging solitude. Nothing existed there, neither
man, nor animal, nor earth, nor tree.

Then appeared a vast expanse of water on which divine beings moved
in brightness. "They said 'earth!' and instantly the earth was created.
It came into being like a vapor; mountains rose above the waters like
lobsters and were made. Thus was the earth created by the Heart of
Heaven." Next came the creation of animals; but the gods were disappointed
because the animals could neither tell their names nor worship the Heart
of Heaven.

Therefore it was resolved that man should be created. First, man was made
of earth, but his flesh had no cohesion; he was inert, could not turn
his head, and had no mind, although he could speak; therefore he was
consumed in the water. Next, men were made of wood, and these multiplied,
but they had neither heart nor intellect, and could not worship, and
so they withered up and disappeared in the waters. A third attempt followed:
man was made of a tree called tzité, and woman of the pith of a reed;
but these failed to think, speak, or worship, and were destroyed, all
save a remnant which still exists as a race of small monkeys found in
forests.

A fourth attempt to create the human race was successful, but the circumstances
attending this creation are veiled in mystery. It took place before the
beginning of dawn, when neither sun nor moon had risen, and
was a wonder-work of the Heart of Heaven. Four men were created, and
they could reason, speak, and see in such a manner as to know all things
at once. They worshiped the Creator with thanks for existence, but the
gods, dismayed and scared, breathed clouds on their eyes to limit
their vision, and cause them to be men and not gods. Afterward, while
the four men were asleep, the gods made for them beautiful wives, and
from these came all the tribes and families of the earth.

No account of the rescued fragments of this old literature of Ancient
America should omit giving due credit to Chevalier Boturini, the Milanese,
who went from Italy to America in 1735 as an agent of the Countess
Santibañey, who claimed to be a descendant of Montezuma. He, too, was a
devotee, and believed that St. Thomas preached the Gospel in America;
but he had antiquarian tastes, and was sufficiently intelligent to
understand the importance of the old manuscripts which had furnished
so much fuel for the bonfires of fanaticism. During the eight years
of his residence in Mexico and Central America he hunted diligently for
those still in existence, and made a considerable collection, including
in it some of the Mexican "picture writings." But when about to
leave, he was despoiled of his treasure and flung into prison by the
Spanish viceroy. He finally left the country with a portion of them, but
was captured by an English cruiser and again despoiled. The manuscripts
left in Mexico were finally sold at auction while Humboldt was there;
he secured a portion of them. Another portion was brought to France about
1830 by M. Aubin, who made important additions to it. M. Aubin himself
spent years searching for remains of the old writings, and he has
now, it is supposed, the most valuable collection in Europe.

It is likely that most of the recovered books may be translated by those
who can bring to the work habits of patient study and a thorough
knowledge of the native dialects. Dictionaries of these dialects, as
they were spoken at the time of the Conquest, were prepared
by some of the Spanish priests, and other facilities are not wanting. It
is surprising, however, that no one has translated the "Codex Chimalpopoca"
(which seems the most important) if the language in which it is written
is in fact sufficiently modern to be managed as easily as that of "Popol
Vuh." It must be translatable, for its general tenor is known, and
passages of it are quoted. Brasseur de Bourbourg states that he has
undertaken a translation. But who will translate the inscriptions
at Copan and Palenque? Is the language in which they were written an
old form of speech, from which the dialects of the Maya family, or a
portion of them, were derived? They have not been translated. No one has
found a clew to their meaning. The characters are understood, but
they appear to show an older form of the language, which at present
can not be deciphered. Brasseur de Bourbourg's "Rosetta Stone," discovered
in Landa's manuscript, will not serve him here. Another more potent must
be found before these old inscriptions can be made to give up their
secrets.[197-*]

THE ANCIENT HISTORY SKETCHED.

It is impossible to know what was contained in the books of annals written
by the official chroniclers of these ancient American countries, for these
books are lost. They existed at the time of the Conquest; some of them
were seen and described by Las Casas; but, so far as is known, not one
of these books of regular annals, such as he described, has escaped
destruction; therefore it is impossible to know any thing certainly
of their character as histories.

The books preserved furnish little more than vague outlines of the past,
with obscure views of distinct periods in the history, created by
successive dominations of different peoples or different branches of
the same people. What they enable us to know of the old history resembles
what is known of the early times of the Greeks, who had no ancient histories
excepting such as were furnished by their "poets of the cycle." In one
case we are told of Pelasgians, Leleges, Cadmeans, Argives, and
Eolians very much as in the other we are told of Colhuas, Chichimecs,
Quinames, and Nahuas.

But the outline is not wholly dark; it does not exclude the possibility
of a reasonable attempt at hypothesis. When Cortez entered Mexico,
the Aztecs, Montezuma's people, had been in power more than two
centuries.
Most of the ancient history, of which something is said in these books,
relates to ages previous to their time, and chiefly to their predecessors,
the Toltecs. According to these writings, the country where the
ruins are found was occupied in successive periods by three distinct
peoples, the Chichimecs, the Colhuas, and the Toltecs or Nahuas. The
Toltecs are said to have come into the country about a thousand years
before the Christian era. Their supremacy appears to have ceased,
and left the country broken up into small states, two or three centuries
before the Aztecs appeared. They were preceded by the Colhuas, by whom
this old civilization was originated and developed. The most ancient
people, those found in the country by the Colhuas, are called Chichimecs.
They are described as a barbarous people who lived by hunting
and fishing, and had neither towns nor agriculture. This term Chichimecs
appears to have been a generic appellation for all uncivilized aborigines.
Brasseur de Bourbourg says, "Under the generic name Chichimecs,
which has much embarrassed some writers, the Mexican traditions
include the whole aboriginal population of the New World, and especially
the people by whom it was first occupied at the beginning of time."

Some of the traditions state that the Colhuas came from the east in
ships. Sahagun mentions that a tradition to this effect was current in
Yucatan. The precise value of these traditional reports is uncertain;
but, if accepted as vague historical recollections, they could be explained
by supposing the civilized people called Colhuas came from South
America through the Caribbean Sea, and landed in Yucatan and Tabasco.
They are uniformly described as the people who first established
civilization and built great cities. They taught the Chichimecs to
cook their food, cultivate the earth, and adopt the ways of civilized
life; and the Chichimecs civilized by their influence are sometimes
called Quinames.

The Colhuas are connected with vague references to a long and
important period in the history previous to the Toltec ages. They seem
to have been, in some respects, more advanced in civilization than the
Toltecs.
What is said of events in their history relates chiefly to their great
city called Xibalba, the capital of an important kingdom to which this
name was given. The Toltecs, in alliance with the uncivilized Chichimecs
of the mountains, subjugated this city and kingdom, and thus brought
to a close the period which may be termed Colhuan. This kingdom appears
to have included Guatemala, Yucatan, Tabasco, Tehuantepec, Chiapa, Honduras,
and other districts in Central America; and it may have included all
Southern Mexico, for places north of the Tampico River are mentioned
as being within its limits when the Toltecs came into the country. Some
of the principal seats of the Colhuan civilization were in the
region now covered by the great forest.

Some investigators have sought to identify the city of Xibalba with
the ruined city known to us as Palenque. Brasseur de Bourbourg says:
"Palenque appears to have been the same city to which the books give
the name of Xibalba;" but this is nothing but conjecture. We may as
reasonably suppose Copan, Quirigua, or some other old ruin, to have been
Xibalba.

Those who attempt to believe this old American civilization was brought
across the Atlantic by the Phoenicians in very remote times, assume,
against the plain testimony of the monuments, that the Colhuas came to
America from some country on the Mediterranean. They may have come from
some other part of this continent. In my judgment, it is not improbable
that they came by sea from South America. Brasseur de Bourbourg would
say they were people of the Atlantic race, who, having escaped
destruction by the cataclysm, found their way to Yucatan and Tabasco.
But there is little beside conjecture to support any theory of their
origin. We have only the fact that, according to the old books and
traditions of the country, they occupied that region at a remote
period, and originated the civilization whose monuments are found
there.
Tradition places their first settlements on the Gulf coast in Tabasco,
between Tehuantepec and Yucatan. It is inferred that the Mayas,
Tzendals, Quichés, and some other communities of the old race, were
descendants of the Colhuas, their speech being more highly developed
than that of any native community not connected with this family, and
their written characters having a close resemblance to those of the oldest
inscriptions.

THE TOLTECS OUR MOUND-BUILDERS.

As the remains of the Mound-Builders show clearly that they had commercial
intercourse with the Mexican and Central American countries, and as it
seems probable that they had otherwise a very close relation to the
people of those countries, it would be surprising to find no mention
of their country in the old books and traditions of the Central
Americans and Mexicans.

If we could have the lost books, especially those of the more ancient
time, and learn to read them, it might be possible to know something
of the origin and history of the Mound-Builders. It is believed that
distinct reference to their country has been found in the books still
in existence, and there appears to be reason for this belief.
Brasseur de Bourbourg, one of the few investigators who have explored
them, says:

"Previous to the history of the Toltec domination in Mexico, we notice
in the annals of the country two facts of great importance, but equally
obscure in their details: first, the tradition concerning the landing
of a foreign race, conducted by an illustrious personage, who came
from an eastern country; and, second, the existence of an ancient empire
known as Huehue-Tlapalan, from which the Toltecs or Nahuas came to
Mexico, in consequence of a revolution or invasion, and from which
they had a long and toilsome migration to the Aztec plateau."
He believes that Huehue-Tlapalan was the country of the Mound-Builders
in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. According to the native books he has
examined, it was somewhere at a distance in the northeast; and it is
constantly said that some of the Toltecs came by land and some by
sea.
Sahagun learned from the old books and traditions, and stated
in the introduction to the first book of his history, that the Toltecs
came from that distant northeastern country; and he mentions a company
that came by sea, settled near the Tampico River, and built a town called
Panuco. Brasseur de Bourbourg finds that an account of this or
another company was preserved at Xilanco, an ancient city situated on
the point of an island between Lake Terminos and the sea, and famous
for its commerce, wealth, and intelligence. The company described
in this account came from the northeast in the same way, it is said,
to the Tampico River, and landed at Panuco. It consisted of twenty chiefs
and a numerous company of people. Torquemada found a record which
describes them as people of fine appearance. They went forward into
the country and were well received. He says they were industrious,
orderly, and intelligent, and that they worked metals, and were skillful
artists and lapidaries. All the accounts say the Toltecs came at different
times, by land and sea, mostly in small companies, and always from the
northeast.
This can be explained only by supposing they came by sea from the
mouth of the Mississippi River or from the Gulf coast near it, and by
land through Texas. But the country from which they came was invariably
Huehue-Tlapalan.

Cabrera says Huehue-Tlapalan was the ancient country of the Toltecs. Its
simple name was Tlapalan, but they called it Huehue, old, to
distinguish it from three other Tlapalans which they founded in the
districts of their new kingdom.

Torquemada says the same. We are not authorized to reject a fact
so distinctly stated and so constantly reported in the old books. The
most we can do against it with any show of reason is to receive it with
doubt. Therefore it seems not improbable that the "Old Tlapalan" of
Central American tradition was the country of our Mound-Builders.

Another circumstance mentioned is not without significance. It is said,
in connection with this account of the Toltec migration, that Huehue-Tlapalan
was successfully invaded by Chichimecs, meaning barbarous aboriginal
tribes, who were united under one great leader.
Here is one statement (a little condensed) touching this point:
"There was a terrible struggle, but, after about thirteen years,
the Toltecs, no longer able to resist successfully, were obliged
to abandon their country to escape complete subjugation. Two chiefs
guided the march of the emigrating nation. At length they reached
a region near the sea named 'Tlapalan-Conco,' where they remained
several years. But they finally undertook another migration and
reached Mexico, where they built a town called 'Tollanzinco,' and
later the city of Tullan, which became the seat of their government."

This is substantially what is told of the defeat and migrations of
the Toltecs. The history of Ixtlilxochitl adds doubtful modifications
and particulars not found in the "Codex Chimalpopoca." (See Quatre
Lettres, etc.) This Chichimec invasion of Huehue-Tlapalan is placed
at a period which, in the chronology of the native books, was long
previous to the Christian era, and is mentioned to explain the
beginning of the Toltec movement toward Mexico; but the account of
it is obscure.
To find a system of chronology in these old books is not surprising
when we consider that even the Aztecs of Montezuma's time knew
enough of astronomy to have a correct measure of the year. The
Aztecs adopted the methods of astronomy and chronology which were
used by their predecessors. They divided the year into eighteen
months of twenty days each; but, as this gave the year only three
hundred and sixty days, five supplementary days were added to each
year, and a sixth day to every fourth year. The bissextile is known
to have been used by the Mayas, Tzendals, and Quichés, and it was
probably common.
We can not reasonably refuse to give some attention to their
chronology, even while doubting its value as a means of fixing dates
and measuring historical periods. Its method was to count by equal
periods of years, as we count by centuries, and their chronology
presents a series of periods which carries back their history to a
very remote time in the past. Brasseur de Bourbourg says: "In the
histories written in the Nahuatl language, the oldest certain date
is nine hundred and fifty-five years before Christ." This, he means,
is the oldest date in the history of the Nahuas or Toltecs which
has been accurately determined.As I leaned over him, and
eagerly scanned his countenance, I perceived that the delirium of fever
was gone. The physician, fearing the effect upon him of the least
excitement, made a motion to me enjoining silence, and mixing a quieting
cordial, held to his lips. He eagerly quaffed the cooling draught, and
again fell into a quiet slumber. "Now," said the physician, "I have a
faint hope that he may recover, but he is so weak that any excitement
would prove fatal; all depends upon keeping him perfectly quiet for the
next few hours." The doctor departed, and again I was left alone to
watch over his slumber. Before morning, anxiety brought Mr. and Mrs.
Sinclair to the room, to learn if there had been any change. In a
whisper I informed them of the favorable symptoms he had evinced upon
waking, and persuaded them to retire from the apartment. When Arthur
again awoke, the favorable symptoms still continued, and the physician
entertained strong hopes of his recovery. By degrees he was allowed to
converse for a few moments at a time. It seemed to him, he said, as
though he had awakened from a frightful dream; and he begged to know how
long he had been ill, and what had happened during the time. We were all
very cautious to say nothing to excite him; and by degrees as his mind
grew stronger, everything came back clearly to his mind, his father's
visit, and the circumstances which had brought him to the city. It is
needless for me to dwell upon the long period, while he lay helpless as
an infant, watched over by his fond mother, who felt that he had almost
been given back from the dead. The colors seen in this room were green,
red, yellow, blue, and reddish-brown. Another edifice, standing on a high
mound, is reached by means of the usual great stairway, which begins
at the bottom, with a sort of balustrade on each side, the ends of
which are stone figures of heads of immense serpents.

[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Great Stone Ring.]
Not far from this is a singular ruin, consisting of groups of small columns
standing in rows five abreast, the tallest being not more than six
feet high. Many of them have fallen. It is impossible to determine how
they were used, or what they mean.

OTHER RUINS IN YUCATAN.

Izamal, Labna, Zayi, and some of the other ruins are sufficiently
important for special notice; but they present every where the same
characteristics, differing a little in the style or method of ornamentation.
At Labna there is among the ruins an ancient gateway, beautiful in
design and construction, a view of which is given in the Frontispiece.
The best account of some of the other ruins on this peninsula can be
found in the volumes of Mr. Stephens, entitled "Incidents of Travel
in Yucatan." At Zayi there is a singular building, which, as seen at
a distance by Mr. Stephens, "had the appearance of a New England
factory." But what seemed to be a "factory" is, in fact, nothing more
than a massive wall with oblong openings, which runs along the middle
of the roof, and rises thirty feet above it. The building was below
this wall, but the front part of it had fallen. Among the remains at Xcoch
is the great mound represented in Figure 44.

There is a remarkable ruin at Ake, at the south, which deserves
mention.
Here, on the summit of a great mound, very level, and 225 feet by 50
in extent, stand 36 shafts or columns, in three parallel rows. The columns
are about 15 feet high and 4 feet square. The ruins of Ake, which cover
a great space, are ruder and more massive than most of the others. The
island of Cozumel and the adjacent coast of Yucatan were populous when
the Spaniards first went there, but the great towns then inhabited
are now in ruins.

[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Great Mound at Xcoch.]
Water is scarce on this peninsula, and a sufficient supply is not
obtained without considerable difficulty. The ancient inhabitants provided
for this lack of water by constructing aguadas or artificial ponds.
These, or many of them, doubtless, are as old as the oldest of the ruined
cities. Intelligence, much skill in masonry, and much labor were
required to construct them. They were paved with several courses of stone
laid in cement, and in their bottoms wells or cavities were constructed.
More than forty such wells were found in the bottom of one of these
aguadas at Galal, which has been repaired and restored to use.
A section of the bottom of this aguada is shown in Figure 45. In some
places long subterranean passages lead down to pools of water, which are
used in the dry season. One of these subterranean reservoirs, and the
cavernous passage leading to it, are shown in Figure 46. The reservoir
is 450 feet below the surface of the ground, and the passage leading to
it is about 1400 feet long. Branching passages, not shown, lead to two
or three other basins of water.

[Illustration: Fig. 45.

[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Subterranean Reservoir.]
The wooden lintels, which are common in Yucatan, do not appear in the
other ruins, and there is a difference in the style of ornamentation
between those at Palenque or Copan, for instance, and those at Uxmal,
but every where the architecture is regulated by the same idea, the
differences indicating nothing more than different periods and
different phases of development in the history of the same
people.
[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Plan of the Walls at Tuloom.]
Some of the great edifices in these old ruins, such as the "Palace"
at Palenque, and the "Casa del Gobernador" at Uxmal, remind us of
the "communal buildings" of the Pueblos, and yet there is a wide
difference between them. They are not alike either in character or
purpose, although such great buildings as the "Palace" may have
been designed for the occupation of several families. There is no
indication that "communal" residences were ever common in this part
of the country. At the time of the Conquest the houses of the people
were ordinary family dwellings, made of wood, and we may reasonably
suppose this fashion of building was handed down from the earlier
ages.The morning had been clear and pleasant, but early in the afternoon
the sky became overcast with dark clouds, and for several hours the snow
fell unceasingly, and now the darkness of night was added to the gloomy
scene. As the night set in, the snow continued to fall in a thick
shower, and a strong easterly wind arose, which filled the air with one
blinding cloud of drifting snow; and the lights in the scattered
habitations in the then primitive settlement of D. could scarcely be
distinguished amid the thick darkness. It was a fearful night to be

We looked forward through the whole border
of its months, weeks, days and hours, and life grew bright with pleased
anticipations. The year has now passed away, and how few, very few, of
all our bright hopes have been realized. With how many of us have
unexpected and unwished for events taken the place of those to which we
looked forward with so much delight.

As the hours and moments of the past year have slowly glided into
the ocean of the past, they have borne with them the treasures of many a
fond heart. The sun shines as brightly as ever, the moon and stars still
look placidly down upon the sleeping earth, and life is the same as it
has ever been; but for these their work is over, and they have done with
time. As I sat watching the fast gathering shadows over the last night
of the old year, I fell into a sort of waking dream, and I seemed to
hear the slow measured tread of one wearily approaching. Turning my eyes
in the direction of the approaching footsteps, I beheld the form of a
very aged man; his countenance appeared somewhat familiar, yet it was
furrowed by many wrinkles, and on his once high and beautiful forehead
were the deep lines of corroding care and anxiety. His step was slow,
and he leaned for support on his now well-nigh failing staff. He bore
the marks of extreme feebleness, and gazed forward with a manner of
timidity and uncertainty, and on his changeful countenance was expressed
all the multitudinous emotions of the human breast. His garments had
once been white and shining, but they were now stained and darkened by
travel, and portions of them trailed in the dust. As he drew nigh I
observed that he carried in his hand a closely written scroll, on which
was recorded the events of the past year. Should it become manifest to
the world that the efforts of Spain to subdue these Provinces will be
fruitless, it may be presumed that the Spanish Government itself will
give up the contest. In producing such a determination it can not be
doubted that the opinion of friendly powers who have taken
no part in the controversy will have their merited influence.

It is of the highest importance to our national character and indispensable
to the morality of our citizens that all violations of our neutrality
should be prevented. No door should be left open for the evasion
of our laws, no opportunity afforded to any who may be disposed to
take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the
nation. It is submitted, therefore, to the consideration of Congress
whether it may not be advisable to revise the laws with a view to this
desirable result.

It is submitted also whether it may not be proper to designate by law the
several ports or places along the coast at which only foreign
ships of war and privateers may be admitted.

The difficulty of sustaining the regulations of our commerce and
of other important interests from abuse without such designation
furnishes a strong motive for this measure.

At the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial
convention between the United States and Great Britain a hope had
been entertained that an article might have been agreed upon mutually
satisfactory to both countries, regulating upon principles of justice
and reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the United States
and the British possessions as well in the West Indies as upon the
continent of North America.

The plenipotentiaries of the two Governments not having been able
to come to an agreement on this important interest, those of the
United States reserved for the consideration of this Government the
proposals which had been presented to them as the ultimate offer
on the part of the British Government, and which they were not
authorized to accept.

On their transmission here they were examined with due deliberation,
the result of which was a new effort to meet the views of the British
Government.

The minister of the United States was instructed to make a further
proposal, which has not been accepted. It was, however, declined in an
amicable manner. I recommend to the consideration of Congress whether
further prohibitory provisions in the laws relating to this intercourse
may not be expedient. It is seen with interest that although it has
not been practicable as yet to agree in any arrangement of this important
branch of their commerce, such is the disposition of the parties that
each will view any regulations which the other may make respecting it
in the most friendly light.

By the fifth article of the convention concluded on the 20th of October,
1818, it was stipulated that the differences which have arisen
between the two Governments with regard to the true intent and meaning
of the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, in relation to the carrying
away by British officers of slaves from the United States after the
exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of peace, should be referred
to the decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be named for that
purpose. The minister of the United States has been instructed to name
to the British Government a foreign sovereign, the common friend to
both parties, for the decision of this question. The answer of that
Government to the proposal when received will indicate the further
measures to be pursued on the part of the United States.

Although the pecuniary embarrassments which affected various parts of the
Union during the latter part of the preceding year have during the
present been considerably augmented, and still continue to exist,
the receipts into the Treasury to the 30th of September last have
amounted to $19,000,000.

After defraying the current expenses of the Government, including the
interest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to that period,
amounting to $18,200,000, there remained in the Treasury on that day
more than $2,500,000, which, with the sums receivable during the remainder
of the year, will exceed the current demands upon the Treasury for
the same period.

The causes which have tended to diminish the public receipts could not
fail to have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which has accrued
upon imposts and tonnage during the three first quarters of the
present year. It is, however, ascertained that the duties which have
been secured during that period exceed $18,000,000, and those of the
whole year will probably amount to $23,000,000.

For the probable receipts of the next year I refer you to the statements
which will be transmitted from the Treasury, which will enable you
to judge whether further provision be necessary.

The great reduction in the price of the principal articles of domestic
growth which has occurred during the present year, and the consequent
fall in the price of labor, apparently so favorable to the success
of domestic manufactures, have not shielded them against other
causes adverse to their prosperity.

The pecuniary embarrassments which have so deeply affected the commercial
interests of the nation have been no less adverse to our manufacturing
establishments in several sections of the Union.

The great reduction of the currency which the banks have been constrained
to make in order to continue specie payments, and the vitiated character
of it where such reductions have not been attempted, instead of
placing within the reach of these establishments the pecuniary aid
necessary to avail themselves of the advantages resulting from the
reduction in the prices of the raw materials and of labor, have
compelled the banks to withdraw from them a portion of the capital
heretofore advanced to them.

That aid which has been refused by the banks has not been obtained from
other sources, owing to the loss of individual confidence from the
frequent failures which have recently occurred in some of our principal
commercial cities.

An additional cause for the depression of these establishments may
probably be found in the pecuniary embarrassments which have recently
affected those countries with which our commerce has been principally
prosecuted.

Their manufactures, for the want of a ready or profitable market
at home, have been shipped by the manufacturers to the United States,
and in many instances sold at a price below their current value at
the place of manufacture.

Although this practice may from its nature be considered temporary or
contingent, it is not on that account less injurious in its effects.

Uniformity in the demand and price of an article is highly
desirable to the domestic manufacturer.

It is deemed of great importance to give encouragement to our
domestic manufacturers.

In what manner the evils which have been adverted to may be remedied, and
how far it may be practicable in other respects to afford to them further
encouragement, paying due regard to the other great interests of the
nation, is submitted to the wisdom of Congress.

The survey of the coast for the establishment of fortifications is now
nearly completed, and considerable progress has been made in the
collection of materials for the construction of fortifications in
the Gulf of Mexico and in the Chesapeake Bay.

The works on the eastern bank of the Potomac below Alexandria and on the
Pea Patch, in the Delaware, are much advanced, and it is expected
that the fortifications at the Narrows, in the harbor of New York,
will be completed the present year.

To derive all the advantages contemplated from these fortifications it
was necessary that they should be judiciously posted, and constructed
with a view to permanence, The progress hitherto has therefore been
slow; but as the difficulties in parts heretofore the least explored and
known are surmounted, it will in future be more rapid. As soon as
the survey of the coast is completed, which it is expected will
be done early in the next spring, the engineers employed in it will
proceed to examine for like purposes the northern and northwestern
frontiers.

The troops intended to occupy a station at the mouth of the St. Peters,
on the Mississippi, have established themselves there, and those who
were ordered to the mouth of the Yellow Stone, on the Missouri, have
ascended that river to the Council Bluff, where they will remain until
the next spring, when they will proceed to the place of their destination.
I have the satisfaction to state that this measure has been executed
in amity with the Indian tribes, and that it promises to produce,
in regard to them, all the advantages which were contemplated by it.

Much progress has likewise been made in the construction of ships
of war and in the collection of timber and other materials for
shipbuilding.

It is not doubted that our Navy will soon be augmented to the number and
placed in all respects on the footing provided for by law.

The Board, consisting of engineers and naval officers, have not yet made
their final report of sites for two naval depots, as instructed according
to the resolutions of March 18 and April 20, 1818, but they have
examined the coast therein designated, and their report is expected in
the next month.

For the protection of our commerce in the Mediterranean, along the southern
Atlantic coast, in the Pacific and Indian oceans, it has been found
necessary to maintain a strong naval force, which it seems proper
for the present to continue.

There is much reason to believe that if any portion of the
squadron heretofore stationed in the Mediterranean should be withdrawn
our intercourse with the powers bordering on that sea would be much
interrupted, if not altogether destroyed. Such, too, has been the growth
of a spirit of piracy in the other quarters mentioned, by adventurers
from every country, in abuse of the friendly flags which they have
assumed, that not to protect our commerce there would be to abandon
it as a prey to their rapacity.

Due attention has likewise been paid to the suppression of the slave
trade, in compliance with a law of the last session.

Orders have been given to the commanders of all our public ships to
seize all vessels navigated under our flag engaged in that trade,
and to bring them in to be proceeded against in the manner prescribed
by that law.

It is hoped that these vigorous measures, supported by like acts
by other nations, will soon terminate a commerce so disgraceful to
the civilized world.

In the execution of the duty imposed by these acts, and of a high
trust connected with it, it is with deep regret I have to state the
loss which has been sustained by the death of Commodore Perry.
His gallantry in a brilliant exploit in the late war added to the
renown of his country.

His death is deplored as a national misfortune.

SPECIAL MESSAGES.

WASHINGTON, _December 7, 1819_.

_To the Senate of the United States_:

I transmit herewith to the Senate a collection of the commercial regulations
of the different foreign countries with which the United States have
commercial intercourse, which has been compiled in compliance with the
resolution of the Senate of 3d March, 1817.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _December 14, 1819_.

_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:

In conformity with the resolution of the House of Representatives
of the 24th of February last, I now transmit a report of the Secretary
of State, with extracts and copies of several letters, touching the
causes of the imprisonment of William White, an American citizen,
at Buenos Ayres.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _December 17, 1819_.

_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:

Some doubt being entertained respecting the true intent and meaning of the
act of the last session entitled "An act in addition to the acts
prohibiting the slave trade," as to the duties of the agents to be
appointed on the coast of Africa, I think it proper to state the
interpretation which has been given of the act and the measures
adopted to carry it into effect, that Congress may, should it be deemed
advisable, amend the same before further proceeding is had under
it.

The obligation to instruct the commanders of all our armed vessels to
seize and bring into port all ships or vessels of the United States,
wheresoever found, having on board any negro, mulatto, or person
of color in violation of former acts for the suppression of the
slave trade, being imperative, was executed without delay.

No seizures have yet been made, but as they were contemplated by the
law, and might be presumed, it seemed proper to make the necessary
regulations applicable to such seizures for carrying the several
provisions of the act into effect.

It is enjoined on the Executive to cause all negroes, mulattoes, or persons
of color who may be taken under the act to be removed to Africa.

It is the obvious import of the law that none of the persons thus taken
should remain within the United States, and no place other than
the coast of Africa being designated, their removal or delivery,
whether carried from the United States or landed immediately from the
vessels in which they were taken, was supposed to be confined to
that coast.

No settlement or station being specified, the whole coast was thought
to be left open for the selection of a proper place at which the persons
thus taken should be delivered. The Executive is authorized to appoint
one or more agents residing there to receive such persons, and $100,000
are appropriated for the general purposes of the law.

On due consideration of the several sections of the act, and of its humane
policy, it was supposed to be the intention of Congress that all the
persons above described who might be taken under it and landed in Africa
should be aided in their return to their former homes, or in their
establishment at or near the place where landed.

Some shelter and food would be necessary for them there as soon as
landed, let their subsequent disposition be what it might.

Should they be landed without such provision having been previously made,
they might perish.

It was supposed, by the authority given to the Executive to appoint
agents residing on that coast, that they should provide such shelter
and food, and perform the other beneficent and charitable offices
contemplated by the act.

The coast of Africa having been little explored, and no persons residing
there who possessed the requisite qualifications to entitle them to
the trust being known to the Executive, to none such could it be committed.
It was believed that citizens only who would go hence well instructed
in the views of their Government and zealous to give them effect
would be competent to these duties, and that it was not the intention
of the law to preclude their appointment.

It was obvious that the longer these persons should be detained in
the United States in the hands of the marshals the greater would be the
expense, and that for the same term would the main purpose of the
law be suspended. It seemed, therefore, to be incumbent on me to make
the necessary arrangements for carrying this act into effect in Africa
in time to meet the delivery of any persons who might be taken by
the public vessels and landed there under it.

On this view of the policy and sanctions of the law it has been
decided to send a public ship to the coast of Africa with two such
agents, who will take with them tools and other implements necessary
for the purposes above mentioned.

To each of these agents a small salary has been allowed--$1,500 to
the principal and $1,200 to the other.

All our public agents on the coast of Africa receive salaries for
their services, and it was understood that none of our citizens
possessing the requisite qualifications would accept these trusts,
by which they would be confined to parts the least frequented and
civilized, without a reasonable compensation, Such allowance therefore
seemed to be indispensable to the execution of the act.

It is intended also to subject a portion of the sum appropriated to the
order of the principal agent for the special objects above stated,
amounting in the whole, including the salaries of the agents for
one year, to rather less than one third of the appropriation.

Special instructions will be given to these agents, defining in
precise terms their duties in regard to the persons thus delivered
to them, the disbursement of the money by the principal agent, and
his accountability for the same. They will also have power to select
the most suitable place on the coast of Africa at which all persons
who may be taken under this act shall be delivered to them, with
an express injunction to exercise no power founded on the principle
of colonization or other power than that of performing the benevolent
offices above recited by the permission and sanction of the existing
government under which they may establish themselves.

Orders will be given to the commander of the public ship in which
they will sail to cruise along the coast to give the more complete
effect to the principal object of the act.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _December 17, 1819_.

_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:

In compliance with a resolution of Congress of the 27th March, 1818,
the journal, acts, and proceedings of the convention which formed
the present Constitution of the United States have been published. The
resolution directs that 1,000 copies should be printed, of which
one copy should be furnished to each member of the Fifteenth Congress,
and the residue to be subject to the future disposition of Congress.
The number of copies sufficient to supply the members of the late
Congress having been reserved for that purpose, the remainder are now
deposited at the Department of State subject to the order of Congress.
The documents mentioned in the resolution of the 27th March, 1818, are
in the process of publication.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _December 24, 1819_.

_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:

On the 23d of February. 1803, a message from the President of the United
States was transmitted to both Houses of Congress, together with the
report of the then Secretary of State, Mr. Madison, upon the case
of the Danish brigantine _Henrick_ and her cargo, belonging to citizens
of Hamburg, recommending the claim to the favorable consideration of
Congress. In February, 1805, it was again presented by a message from the
President to the consideration of Congress, but has not since been
definitively acted upon.

The minister resident from Denmark and the consul-general from Hamburg
having recently renewed applications in behalf of the respective owners
of the vessel and cargo, I transmit herewith copies of their communications
for the further consideration of the Legislature, upon whose files all
the documents relating to the claim are still existing.

JAMES MONROE.

DECEMBER 31, 1819.

_To the Senate of the United States_:

I transmit to the Senate, for its advice and consent as to the
ratification, three treaties which have been concluded in the course
of the present year with the Kickapoos, the Chippaways, and the Kickapoos
of the Vermillion by commissioners who were duly authorized for
the purpose.

With the Chippaways there is a supplementary article stipulating
certain advantages in their favor on condition that the same shall be
ratified by the Executive, with the advice and consent of the Senate,
which I likewise submit to your consideration.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _January 8, 1820_.

_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:

In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the
14th December, 1819, requesting me to cause to be laid before it any
information I may possess respecting certain executions which have
been inflicted in the Army of the United States since the year 1815
contrary to the laws and regulations provided for the government of
the same, I transmit a report from the Secretary of War containing a
detailed account in relation to the object of the said resolution.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _January 8, 1820_.

_To the Senate of the United States_:

In compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 20th of January,
1819, requesting me "to cause a report to be laid before them at their
next session of such facts as may be within the means of the Government
to obtain shewing how far it may be expedient or not to provide by law
for clothing the Army with articles manufactured in the United States,"
I transmit a report from the Secretary of War, which, with the accompanying
documents, comprehends all the information required by the Senate in their
resolution aforesaid.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _January 19, 1820_.

_To the House of Representatives_:

In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives requesting
me "to lay before it at as early a day as may be convenient an account
of the expenditure of the several sums appropriated for building
fortifications from the year 1816 to the year 1819, inclusive,
indicating the places at which works of defense have been begun, the
magnitude of the works contemplated at each place, their present
condition, the amount already expended, and the estimated amount requisite
for the completion of each, also the mode by which the fortifications
are built, by contract or otherwise," I now transmit to the House a
report from the Secretary of War, to whom the said resolution was
referred, which, with the documents accompanying it, contains all
the information required.

JAMES MONROE.

WASHINGTON, _February 8, 1820_.About fifty miles distant from this
city I was taken ill, and for several weeks was unable to proceed on my
way. When I was sufficiently recovered to allow of my again travelling I
found it to be imperatively necessary that I should seek some place
where I could earn a support for myself and child, as the small sum of
money with which I left Boston was now nearly gone. The kind gentleman,
in whose house I remained during my illness, informed me that he was
well acquainted in the village of Walden, and he thought it a place
where I would be likely to succeed in establishing a select school for
young children, as he informed me there were many wealthy people
residing here, who would patronize a school of this kind. With this
intention I came to this village, and when I purchased my ticket for
Walden I had but one dollar remaining in my purse, which, with the
clothing and other articles contained in my trunk is all I possess in
the world. But this matters little to me now, for I feel that my days on
earth are numbered. I am unable to reward you for your exceeding
kindness to myself and child; but I pray Heaven to reward and bless you,
both temporally and spiritually. It is hard for me to leave my dear
child, but I now feel resigned to the will of Heaven, knowing that
whatever He wills is for the best."


CHAPTER IV.


And so the little orphan boy found a home and friends to love and
cherish him.

Mr. and Mrs. Humphrey felt a tender love for the lovely and engaging
orphan. [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Square Mound, near Marietta.]

There have been a great many conjectures in regard to the purposes for
which these mounds were built, some of them rather fanciful. I find it
most reasonable to believe that the mounds in this part of the continent
were used precisely as similar structures were used in Mexico and
Central America.

The lower mounds, or most of them, must have been constructed as foundations
of the more important edifices of the mound-building people. Many of
the great buildings erected on such pyramidal foundations, at Palenque,
Uxmal, and elsewhere in that region, have not disappeared, because
they were built of hewn stone laid in mortar.

For reasons not difficult to understand, the Mound-Builders, beginning
their works on the lower Mississippi, constructed such edifices of
wood or some other perishable material; therefore not a trace of
them remains. The higher mounds, with broad, flat summits, reached
by flights of steps on the outside, are like the Mexican _teocallis_,
or temples. In Mexico and Central America these structures were very
numerous.

They are described as solid pyramidal masses of earth, cased with brick
or stone, level at the top, and furnished with ascending ranges
of steps on the outside.

The resemblance is striking, and the most reasonable explanation seems
to be that in both regions mounds of this class were intended
for the same uses.

Figure 4 shows the works at Cedar Bank, Ohio, inclosing a mound. The mound
within the inclosure is 245 feet long by 150 broad. Figure 5 shows
a group of mounds in Washington County, Mississippi, some of which
are connected by means of causeways.

[Illustration: Fig. 4--Works at Cedar Bank, Ohio.]
[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Works in Washington County, Mississippi.]

Another class of these antiquities consists of inclosures formed by heavy
embankments of earth and stone. There is nothing to explain these
constructions so clearly as to leave no room for conjecture and
speculation.

It has been suggested that some of them may have been intended for
defense, others for religious purposes. A portion of them, it may
be, encircled villages or towns.

In some cases the ditches or fosses were on the inside, in others on the
outside. But no one can fully explain why they were made. We know only
that they were prepared intelligently, with great labor, for human
uses. "Lines of embankment varying from 5 to 30 feet in height, and
inclosing from 1 to 50 acres, are very common, while inclosures containing
from 100 to 200 acres are not infrequent, and occasional works are
found inclosing as many as 400 acres." Figures 6 and 7 give views of the
Hopeton works, four miles north of Chillicothe, Ohio.

Combinations of the square and circle are common in these ancient
works, and the figures are always perfect.

This perfection of the figures proves, as Squier and Davis remark, that
"the builders possessed a standard of measurement, and had a means of
determining angles."
[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Works at Hopeton, Ohio.]
[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Principal Figures of the Hopeton Works.]
About 100 inclosures and 500 mounds have been examined in Ross County,
Ohio. The number of mounds in the whole state is estimated at over 10,000,
and the number of inclosures at more than 1500. The great number of these
ancient remains in the regions occupied by the Mound-Builders is really
surprising. They are more numerous in the regions on the lower Mississippi
and the Gulf of Mexico than any where else; and here, in some cases,
sun-dried brick was used in the embankments.

One peculiarity at the South is, that while the inclosures are generally
smaller and comparatively less numerous, there is a greater
proportion of low mounds, and these are often larger in extent.

Harrison Mound, in South Carolina, is 480 feet in circumference and 15
feet high.

Another is described as 500 feet in circumference at the base, 225 at
the summit, and 34 feet high. In a small mound near this, which was
opened, there was found "an urn holding 46 quarts," and also a
considerable deposit of beads and shell ornaments very much decomposed.

Broad terraces of various heights, mounds with several stages,
elevated passages, and long avenues, and aguadas or artificial
ponds, are common at the South.

Figure 8 shows the remains of a graded way of this ancient people near
Piketon, Ohio.

[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Graded Way near Piketon, Ohio.]
At Seltzertown, Mississippi, there is a mound 600 feet long, 400
wide, and 40 feet high. The area of its level summit measures 4 acres.
There was a ditch around it, and near it are smaller mounds.

Mr. J. R.
Bartlett says, on the authority of Dr. M. W. Dickeson, "The north side
of this mound is supported by a wall of sun-dried brick two feet thick,
filled with grass, rushes, and leaves." Dr. Dickeson mentions angular
tumuli, with corners "still quite perfect," and "formed of large
bricks bearing the impression of human hands." In Louisiana, near the
Trinity, there is a great inclosure partially faced with sun-dried
bricks of large size; and in this neighborhood ditches and artificial
ponds have been examined.

In the Southern States these works appear to assume a closer resemblance
to the mound work of Central America.

The result of intelligent exploration and study of these antiquities
is stated as follows: "Although possessing throughout certain general
points of resemblance going to establish a kindred origin, these works
nevertheless resolve themselves into three grand geographical
divisions, which present in many respects striking contrasts, yet
so gradually merge into each other that it is impossible to determine
where one series terminates and another begins."

On the upper lakes, and to a certain extent in Michigan, Iowa, and Missouri,
but particularly in Wisconsin, the outlines of the inclosures
(elsewhere more regular in form) were designed in the forms of
animals, birds, serpents, and even men, appearing on the surface
of the country like huge _relievos_.

The embankment of an irregular inclosure in Adams County, Ohio, is
described as follows by Squier and Davis, Mr. Squier having made
the drawing of it for the work published by the Smithsonian Institution:

"It is in the form of a serpent, upward of 1000 feet in length, extended
in graceful curves, and terminating in a triple coil at the tail. The
embankment constituting this figure is more than 5 feet high, with a
base 30 feet wide at the centre of the body, diminishing somewhat toward
the head and tail. The neck of the figure is stretched out and slightly
curved. The mouth is wide open, and seems in the act of swallowing or
ejecting an oval figure which rests partly within the distended
jaws.

This oval is formed by an embankment 4 feet high, and is perfectly regular
in outline, its transverse and conjugate diameters being respectively 160
and 80 feet. The combined figure has been regarded as a symbolical
illustration of the Oriental cosmological idea of the serpent and the
egg; but, however this may be, little doubt can exist of the symbolical
character of the monument."
Figure 9 gives a view of this work.

No symbolic device is more common among the antiquities of Mexico and
Central America than the form of the serpent, and it was sometimes
reproduced in part in architectural constructions. One of the old
books, giving account of a temple dedicated to Quetzalcohuatl,
says, "It was circular in form, and the entrance represented the
mouth of a serpent, opened in a frightful manner, and extremely
terrifying to those who approached it for the first time."

[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Great Serpent, Adams County, Ohio.]
On the Ohio and its tributaries, and farther south, where the mounds
are numerous, the inclosures have more regular forms; and in the
Ohio Valley very often their great extent has incited speculation.

At Newark, Ohio, when first discovered, they were spread over an area
more than two miles square, and still showed more than twelve miles
of embankment from two to twenty feet high. Farther south, as already
stated, the inclosures are fewer and smaller, or, to speak more
exactly, the great inclosures and high mounds are much less common
than low truncated pyramids, and pyramidal platforms or foundations
with dependent works.

Passing up the valley, it is found that Marietta, Newark, Portsmouth,
Chillicothe, Circleville, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri, and Frankfort,
Kentucky, were favorite seats of the Mound-Builders. This leads one
of the most intelligent investigators to remark that "the centres
of population are now where they were when the mysterious race of
Mound-Builders existed."

There is, however, this difference: the remains indicate that their most
populous and advanced communities were at the South. Figure 10 shows a
fortified hill in Butler County, Ohio.

[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Fortified Hill, Butler County, Ohio.]
Among those who have examined and described remains of the
Mound-Builders, Messrs.

Squier and Davis rank first in importance, because they have done most
to give a particular and comprehensive account of them. Their great
work, published by the Smithsonian Institution, must be regarded as
the highest authority, and those who desire to study the whole subject
more in detail will find that work indispensable.

EXTENT OF THEIR SETTLEMENTS.

Careful study of what is shown in the many reports on these ancient
remains seems plainly to authorize the conclusion that the
Mound-Builders entered the country at the South, and began their
settlements near the Gulf.

Here they must have been very numerous, while their works at every
point on the limit of their distribution, north, east, and west, indicate
a much less numerous border population. Remains of their works have been
traced through a great extent of country. They are found in West Virginia,
and are spread through Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa to Nebraska.

Lewis and Clarke reported seeing them on the Missouri River, a
thousand miles above its junction with the Mississippi; but this
report has not been satisfactorily verified.

They have been observed on the Kansas, Platte, and other remote Western
rivers, it is said. They are found all over the intermediate and the more
southern country, being most numerous in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Texas.

This ancient race seems to have occupied nearly the whole basin of the
Mississippi and its tributaries, with the fertile plains along the
Gulf, and their settlements were continued across the Rio Grande
into Mexico; but toward their eastern, northern, and western limit
the population was evidently smaller, and their occupation of the
territory less complete than in the Valley of the Ohio, and from
that point down to the Gulf.

No other united people previous to our time can be supposed to have
occupied so large an extent of territory in this part of North America.

It has heretofore been stated that remains of this people exist in Western
New York, but a more intelligent and careful examination shows that the
works in Western New York are not remains of the Mound-Builders. This
is now the opinion of Mr. Squier, formed on personal investigation since
the great work of Squier and Davis was published.

THEIR CIVILIZATION.

It is usual to rank the civilized life of the Mound-Builders much
below that of the ancient people of Mexico and Central America.

This may be correct, for the remains as they now exist appear to justify
it. But if all the ancient stone-work in Central America, with its
finely-carved inscriptions and wonderful decorations, had disappeared
in the ages before Europeans visited this continent, the difference might
not appear to be so great; for then the Central American remains,
consisting only of earth-works, truncated pyramids, pyramidal
foundations, and their connected works made of earth, would have a
closer resemblance to works of the Mound-Builders, to those especially
found on the lower Mississippi.

On the other hand, if we now had in the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys
remains of the more important edifices anciently constructed there, the
Mound-Builders might be placed considerably higher in the scale of
civilization than it has been customary to allow.

It can be seen, without long study of their works as we know them, that
the Mound-Builders had a certain degree of civilization which raised
them far above the condition of savages. To make such works possible
under any circumstances, there must be settled life, with its accumulations
and intelligently organized industry.

Fixed habits of useful work, directed by intelligence, are what barbarous
tribes lack most of all. A profound change in this respect is
indispensable to the beginning of civilization in such tribes.

No savage tribe found here by Europeans could have undertaken such
constructions as those of the Mound-Builders. The wild Indians found
in North America lived rudely in tribes. They had only such organization
as was required by their nomadic habits, and their methods of
hunting and fighting.

These barbarous Indians gave no sign of being capable of the systematic
application to useful industry which promotes intelligence,
elevates the condition of life, accumulates wealth, and undertakes
great works. This condition of industry, of which the worn and decayed
works of the Mound-Builders are unmistakable monuments, means
civilization.

Albert Gallatin, who gave considerable attention to their remains, thought
their works indicated not only "a dense agricultural population," but
also a state of society essentially different from that of the
Iroquois and Algonquin Indians.

He was sure that the people who established such settlements and built
such works must have been "eminently agricultural." No trace of their
ordinary dwellings is left.

These must have been constructed of perishable materials, which
went to dust long before great forests had again covered most of the
regions through which they were scattered. Doubtless their dwellings
and other edifices were made of wood, and they must have been numerous.
It is abundantly evident that there were large towns at such places
as Newark, Circleville, and Marietta, in Ohio.

Figures 11 and 12 give views of works on Paint Creek, Ohio.

[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Stone-work in Paint Creek Valley,
Ohio.]
Their agricultural products may have been similar to many of those found
in Mexico; and it is not improbable that the barbarous Indians, who
afterward occupied the country, learned from them the cultivation of
maize. Their unity as a people, which is every where so manifest,
must have been expressed in political organization, else it could
not have been maintained.

[Illustration: Fig. 12.

[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Ancient Work, Pike County, Ohio.]
[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Elliptical Work near Brownsville, Ohio.]
[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Works near Liberty, Ohio.]
In the details of their works, and in manufactured articles taken from
the mounds, there is evidence of considerable civilization. For
instance, it has been ascertained that the circular inclosures are perfect
circles, and the square inclosures perfect squares. They were constructed
with a geometrical precision which implies a kind of knowledge in the
builders that may be called scientific. Figures 13, 14, 15, 16 show
some of the more important works of the Mound-Builders, chiefly in Ohio.
Relics of art have been dug from some of the mounds, consisting of a
considerable variety of ornaments and implements, made of copper, silver,
obsidian, porphyry, and greenstone, finely wrought.

There are axes, single and double; adzes, chisels, drills or gravers,
lance-heads, knives, bracelets, pendants, beads, and the like, made of
copper. There are articles of pottery, elegantly designed and finished;
ornaments made of silver, bone, mica from the Alleghanies, and shells
from the Gulf of Mexico.

[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Rectangular Work, Randolph County, Indiana.]
The articles made of stone show fine workmanship; some of them are
elaborately carved.

Tools of some very hard material must have been required to work the
porphyry in this manner. Obsidian is a volcanic product largely used by
the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians for arms and cutting instruments. It
is found in its natural state nowhere nearer the Mississippi Valley than
the Mexican mountains of Cerro Gordo.

There appears to be evidence that the Mound-Builders had the art
of spinning and weaving, for cloth has been found among their
remains.

At the meeting of the International Congress of Pre-Historic Archæology
held at Norwich, England, in 1868, one of the speakers stated this fact
as follows: "Fragments of charred cloth made of spun fibres have been
found in the mounds.

A specimen of such cloth, taken from a mound in Butler County, Ohio, is
in Blackmore Museum, Salisbury.

It read as follows:--

    "My dear little Earnest,--Long before your eyes will rest
    upon these lines, the hand that traces them will have mouldered
    into dust. The contents of this package with my prayerful blessing,

They also, for the first time, spoke of the fearful sorrow he had caused
them by being brought to his home in a state of intoxication; and
besought him never again to allow himself to be persuaded to taste of

I have already said that the buildings of the ancient cathedral, with
a special exception to be considered hereafter, were completed before
the great ecclesiastical changes of the sixteenth century.

Our next subject will be some history of the events which the cathedral
witnessed from time to time during its existence, and for this we
have to go back to the very beginning, to the first simple building,
whatever it was, in which the first bishop, Mellitus, began his ministry.
He founded the church in 604, and he had troubled times.
The sons of his patron, King Sebert, relapsed into paganism, indeed they
had never forsaken it, though so long as their father lived they had
abstained from heathen rites. One day, entering the church, they saw
the bishop celebrating the Sacrament, and said, "Give us some of that
white bread which you gave our father." Mellitus replied that they
could not receive it before they were baptized; whereupon they
furiously exclaimed that he should not stay among them.

In terror he fled abroad, as did Justus from Rochester, and as Laurence
would have done from Canterbury, had he not received a Divine warning.
Kent soon returned to the faith which it had abandoned; but Essex for
a while remained heathen, and when Mellitus wished to return they refused
him, and he succeeded Laurence at Canterbury. Other bishops
ministered to the Christians as well as they could; but the authority
of the See and the services of the cathedral were restored by Erkenwald,
one of the noblest of English prelates, son of Offa, King of East Anglia.
He founded the two great monasteries of Chertsey and Barking, ruled
the first himself, and set his sister Ethelburga over the other.

In 675 he was taken from his abbey and consecrated fourth Bishop of
London by Archbishop Theodore, and held the See until 693.

He was a man, by universal consent, of saintly life and vast energy.

He left his mark by strengthening the city wall and building the
gate, which is called after him Bishopsgate. Close by is the church which
bears the name of his sister, St. Ethelburga. He converted King Sebba
to the faith; but it was probably because of his beneficent deeds to the
Londoners that he was second only to Becket in the popular estimate,
all over southern England.

There were pilgrimages from the country around to his shrine in the
cathedral, special services on his day, and special hymns. In
fact, as in the case of St.

Edward, there were two days dedicated to him, that of his death, April
30, and that of his translation, November 14, and these days
were classed in London among the high festivals.

His costly shrine was at the back of the screen behind the high
altar.

The inscription upon it, besides enumerating the good deeds we have named,
said that he added largely to the noble buildings of the cathedral,
greatly enriched its revenues, and obtained for it many privileges
from kings.

His name, so far as its etymology is concerned, found its repetition
in _Archibald_, Bishop of London, 1856-1868, the founder of the
"Bishop of London's Fund."

Another bishop of these early times was Theodred, who was named "the
Good." We cannot give the exact dates of his episcopate, further than
that he was in the See in the middle of the tenth century, as is
shown by some charters that he witnessed. There is a pathetic story told
of him that on his way from London to join King Athelstan in the
north he came to St. Edmund's Bury, and found some men who were charged
with robbing the shrine of St. Edmund, and were detected by the
Saint's miraculous interference. The bishop ordered them to be
hanged; but the uncanonical act weighed so heavily on his conscience
that he performed a lifelong penance, and as an expiation reared a
splendid shrine over the saint's body.

And further, he persuaded the King to decree, in a Witanagemote, that
no one younger than fifteen should be put to death for theft. The bishop
was buried in the crypt of St. Paul's, and the story was often told
at his tomb, which was much frequented by the citizens, of his
error and his life-long sorrow.

Another bishop who had been placed in the See by Edward the Confessor,
who, it will be remembered, greatly favoured Normans, to the
indignation of the English people, was known as "William the Norman,"
and, unpopular as the appointment may have been, it did the English
good service.

Let this
circumstance encourage you, never to grow weary nor discouraged in your
labours for the good of your children, and "ye shall in no wise lose
your reward."


THE END.
