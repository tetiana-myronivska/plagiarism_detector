     PROFESSOR H.G. SEELEY: In common with you all, I have listened with
     great pleasure to this interesting and wide-reaching address. I
     have not myself been so far afield. My observations were limited to
     Cape Colony; and the things which I saw in that Colony were
     necessarily, to a large extent, different from those recorded by
     Sir Frederick Young. On landing at Cape Town I naturally turned to
     what the people of South Africa were doing for themselves, and
     confess I was amazed when I saw the great docks, by means of which
     the commerce of South Africa is being encouraged, and by which it
     will hereafter be developed. day at the office and employers

     years' time_.)
     Thanks to a gift of piercing sight (Not far removed from that of
     MOSES), Beyond the secular veil of night I see a City crowned
     with light, A London redolent of roses.
     
     I note an air of morning prime, As used by bards for their afflatus,
     Recovered from the spacious time Ere yet a triple coat of grime Had
     blocked our breathing-apparatus.
     
     Swept clean of smuts and chimney-stacks Each roof becomes a
     blooming garden, And there, reclining on its backs, All day the
     jocund public slacks As in the thymy glades of Arden.
     

     On Thames's bosom, crystal-clear, Glad urchins bob about like
     bladders; The fly is cast from Wapping pier, And over the
     Pool's pellucid weir Salmon go leaping up their ladders.
     
     I dream how Covent's gritty bowers (By leave of MALLABY's line)
     shall wear a Fat smile to greet the sunnier hours For joy of battles
     fought with flowers, As it might be in Bordighera.
     
     New Bond Streets on the Surrey side Shall flaunt their gems and
     rare chinchillas To swell the local mummer's pride, And
     every bridge shall span the tide With Arcadies of Aston villas.
     
     I see, in fact, old London rise From smokeless ashes, like a Phoenix,
     To moral planes where Beauty lies And Electricity supplies The motive
     power of pure Hygienics.
     
     But not in _our_ time (hush, my heart!); A score of lustres will have
     fleeted Before the Ministry of Art, Though it should make an early
     start, Can hope to see the thing completed.
     
     Meanwhile this London is my place.
     Sad though her dirt, as I admit, is, I love the dear unconscious grace
     That shines beneath her sooty face Better than all your well-groomed
     cities.

     "A Belgian Princess and Her Creditors.
     
     'Le Soir' (Brussels) announces that the creditors of Princess
     Louise will receive the sum of 4,172 millions of francs, and
     consequently the legal proceedings before the Court of Appeal will
     not take place."
     _Pall Mall Gazette_.
     
     Such a paltry sum to make a fuss about! But, as usual, we hide our
     real feelings behind this flippant mask. Reading between the
     lines we confess to strange apprehensions. Why has the Princess so
     gravely exceeded her dress allowance? Has she, on behalf of
     her beloved country, been collecting war-ships? Has she 50
     or 60 _Dreadnoughts_ up her sleeve to upset the balance of naval
     power on "the day"? We make the German Chancellor a present of
     these disturbing reflections.

HIS SON'S FATHER.
In at least one of our daily newspapers the attention of the public
was recently drawn to a brilliant young orator, ANTHONY ASQUITH by
name, who began a series of lectures at Antibes before influential
audiences. The first two of the series dealt with aviation and music
respectively. We understand that the titles of the remainder of the
series will include "Physical Culture," "The Limitations of Radium,"
"The Place of Theosophy in Metaphysics," and "The Proper Education
of the Child."
We learn from a correspondent that this gifted gentleman (who, by
the way, is still quite young, being, well on the bright side of
his teens) is a member of a highly-respected London family resident
within a stone's throw of Whitehall.
After a career full of promise at Oxford, Master ANTHONY ASQUITH's
father was called to the Bar; and although he no longer follows the
profession of barrister (in which, by the way, he rose to the
distinction of King's Counsel), he is not forgotten by many of his
old colleagues in Lincoln's Inn. It was at one time common knowledge
that he would certainly have been made a judge had he only remained
active in his profession. He has devoted the last few years, however,
to political work, which has always had a particular attraction for
him. As a man of sound judgment and ready acumen, Mr. ANTHONY
ASQUITH's father is much honoured in the councils of his own party;
he is also a very effective speaker, and is sure of a large and
appreciative audience whenever he addresses a meeting, whether it
be in London or elsewhere.After all, there is something which goes to build up a
     country besides material wealth, and I am not sure that gambling in
     gold shares is exactly the thing which is wanted. Of course, there
     have been other countries where these vast increases of material
     wealth have occurred--California and Australia--but there the
     conditions were different. They were new countries, which attracted
     large numbers of white men, and, when they found the gold fields
     did not pay, they made homes for themselves on the land.
     Unfortunately, that state of affairs does not exist at the present
     time in South Africa, and that brings us face to face with the
     great problem on which Sir Frederick Young has touched--the great
     problem which we have always before us--viz., how two races utterly
     alien to each other, the black and the white, are to live and
     increase side by side. South Africa is the only country in the
     world where that problem exists, excepting the Southern States of
     North America. the it Colds their we of a us. Drury Men as head

     and if Sir Frederick Young can give us a receipt for making English
     people settle there he will confer one of the greatest possible
     benefits on South Africa. Sir Frederick Young departed from the
     usual custom on such occasions by touching on politics. I am glad
     he did, because more interest is given to the discussion, and there
     is nothing like good, healthy controversy. Sir Frederick Young is
     greatly concerned that there should be a settled policy for South
     Africa. Thus, uniforms were all very well for dance and restaurant
     bands, but he would not like to see the Queen's Hall Symphony
     Orchestra competing with Blue Bessarabians or Pink
     Alsatians.
Herr KUBELIK declared that a violin _virtuoso_ could never play his

     forthcoming performances of_Parsifal be_ should wear mantillas
     alternatively serious effort to bring the arts of of aigrettes
     is almost the music and dress into a true and fitting relation.I cannot help thinking Sir Frederick
     Young did injustice to some of my friends who have been at the head
     of affairs.
