ALL THE BROTHERS WERE VALIANT


ALL THE BROTHERS WERE VALIANT

I


The fine old house stood on Jumping Tom Hill, above the town. It had
stood there before there was a town, when only a cabin or two fringed the
woods below, nearer the shore. The weather boarding had been brought in
ships from England, ready sawed; likewise the bricks of the chimney.
Indians used to come to the house in the cold of winter, begging shelter.
Given blankets, and food, and drink, they slept upon the kitchen floor;
and when Joel Shore's great-great-grandfather came down in the morning,
he found Indians and blankets gone together. Sometimes the Indians came
back with a venison haunch, or a bear steak ... sometimes not at all.

The house had, now, the air of disuse which old New England houses often
have. It was in perfect repair; its paint was white, and its shutters
hung squarely at the windows. But the grass was uncut in the yard, and
the lack of a veranda, and the tight-closed doors and windows, made the
house seem lifeless and lacking the savor of human presence. There was a
white-painted picket fence around the yard; and a rambler rose draped
these pickets. The buds on the rose were bursting into crimson flower.

The house was four-square, plain, and without any ornamentation. It was
built about a great, square chimney that was like a spine. There were six
flues in this chimney, and a pot atop each flue. These little chimney
pots breaking the severe outlines of the house, gave the only suggestion
of lightness or frivolity about it. They were like the heads of impish
children, peeping over a fence....

Across the front of this house, on the second floor, ran a single, long
room like a corridor. Its windows looked down, across the town, to the
Harbor. A glass hung in brackets on the wall; there was a hog-yoke in its
case upon a little table, and a ship's chronometer, and a compass....
There were charts in a tin tube upon the wall, and one that showed the
Harbor and the channel to the sea hung between the middle windows. In the
north corner, a harpoon, and two lances, and a boat spade leaned. Their
blades were covered with wooden sheaths, painted gray. A fifteen-foot
jawbone, cleaned and polished and with every curving tooth in place, hung
upon the rear wall and gleamed like old and yellow ivory. The chair at
the table was fashioned of whalebone; and on a bracket above the table
rested the model of a whaling ship, not more than eighteen inches long,
fashioned of sperm ivory and perfect in every detail. Even the tiny
harpoons in the boats that hung along the rail were tipped with bits of
steel....

The windows of this place were tight closed; nevertheless, the room was
filled with the harsh, strong smell of the sea.

Joel Shore sat in the whalebone chair, at the table, reading a book. The
book was the Log of the House of Shore. Joel's father had begun it, when
Joel and his four brothers were ranging from babyhood through youth.... A
full half of the book was filled with entries in old Matthew Shore's
small, cramped hand. The last of these entries was very short. It began
with a date, and it read:

"Wind began light, from the south. This day came into Harbor the bark
_Winona_, after a cruise of three years, two months, and four days.
Captain Chase reported that my eldest son, Matthew Shore, was killed by
the fluke of a right whale, at Christmas Island. The whale yielded
seventy barrels of oil. Matthew Shore was second mate."

And below, upon a single line, like an epitaph, the words:

                   "'All the brothers were valiant.'"

Two days after, the old man sickened; and three weeks later, he died. He
had set great store by big Matt....

Joel, turning the leaves of the Log, and scanning their brief entries,
came presently to this--written in the hand of his brother John:

"Wind easterly. This day the _Betty_ was reported lost on the Japan
grounds, with all hands save the boy and the cook. Noah Shore was third
mate. Day ended as it began."

And below, again, that single line:

                   "'All the brothers were valiant.'"

There followed many pages filled with reports of rich cruises, when ships
came home with bursting casks, and the brothers of the House of Shore
played the parts of men. The entries were now in the hand of one, now of
another; John and Mark and Joel.... Joel read phrases here and there....

"This day the _Martin Wilkes_ returned ... two years, eleven months and
twenty-two days ... died on the cruise, and first mate John Shore became
captain. Day ended as it began."

And, a page or two further on:

"... _Martin Wilkes_ ... two years, two months, four days ... tubs on
deck filled with oil, for which there was no more room in the casks ...
Captain John Shore."

Mark Shore's first entry in the Log stood out from the others; for Mark's
hand was bold, and strong, and the letters sprawled blackly along the
lines. Furthermore, Mark used the personal pronoun, while the other
brothers wrote always in the third person. Mark had written:

"This day, I, Mark Shore, at the age of twenty-seven, was given command
of the whaling bark _Nathan Ross_."

Joel read this sentence thrice. There was a bold pride in it, and a
strong and reckless note which seemed to bring his brother before his
very eyes. Mark had always been so, swift of tongue, and strong, and
sure. Joel turned another page, came to where Mark had written:

"This day I returned from my first cruise with full casks in two years,
seven months, fifteen days. I found the _Martin Wilkes_ in the dock. They
report Captain John Shore lost at Vau Vau in an effort to save the ship's
boy, who had fallen overboard. The boy was also lost."

And, below, in bold and defiant letters:

                   "'All the brothers were valiant.'"

There were two more pages of entries, in Mark's hand or in Joel's, before
the end. When he came to the fresh page, Joel dipped his pen, and huddled
his broad shoulders over the book, and slowly wrote that which had to be
written.

"Wind northeast, light," he began, according to the ancient form of the
sea, which makes the state of wind and weather of first and foremost
import. "Wind northeast, light. This day the _Martin Wilkes_ finished a
three year cruise. Found in port the _Nathan Ross_. She reports that
Captain Mark Shore left the ship when she watered at the Gilbert Islands.
He did not return, and could not be found. They searched three weeks.
They encountered hostile islanders. No trace of Mark Shore."

When he had written thus far, he read the record to himself, his lips
moving; then he sat for a space with frowning brows, thinking, thinking,
wondering if there were a chance....

But in the end he cast the hope aside. If Mark lived, they would have
found him, would surely have found him....

And so Joel wrote the ancient line:

                   "'All the brothers were valiant.'"

And below, as an afterthought, he added: "Joel Shore became first mate of
the _Martin Wilkes_ on her cruise."

He blotted this line, and closed the book, and put it away. Then he went
to the windows that looked down upon the Harbor, and stood there for a
long time. His face was serene, but his eyes were faintly troubled. He
did not see the things that lay outspread below him.

Yet they were worth seeing. The town was old, and it had the fragrance of
age about it.

Below Joel, on the hill's slopes, among the trees, stood the square white
houses of the town folk. Beyond them, the white spire of the church with
its weather vane atop. Joel marked that the wind was still northeast. The
vane swung fitfully in the light air. He could see the masts and yards of
the ships along the waterfront. The yards of the _Nathan Ross_ were
canted in mournful tribute to his brother. At the pier end beside her, he
marked the ranks of casks, brown with sweating oil. Beyond, the smooth
water ruffled in the wind, and dark ripple-shadows moved across its
surface with each breeze. But Germany, retaining Bismarck's former impulse,
went straight on and rushed forward along the lines of least resistance
to east and west:
on the one side lay the route to the Orient, on the other the empire
of the sea. But in so doing she virtually declared war on the nations
which Bismarck had managed to keep allied or friendly.

Her ambition looked forward to the domination of the world.

Moreover, there was no moral restraint which could keep this ambition under
control. Intoxicated by victory, by the prestige which victory had given
her, and of which her commerce, her industry, her science even,
had reaped the benefit, Germany plunged into a material prosperity
such as she had never known, such as she would never have dared to
dream of.

She told herself that if force had wrought this miracle, if force had
given her riches and honour, it was because force had within it a hidden
virtue, mysterious--nay, divine. Yes, brute force with its train of
trickery and lies, when it comes with powers of attack sufficient for the
conquest of the world, must needs be in direct line from heaven and a
revelation of the will of God on earth. The people to whom this power of
attack had come were the elect, a chosen race by whose side the others
are races of bondmen. To such a race nothing is forbidden that may
help in establishing its dominion. Let none speak to it of inviolable
right! Right is what is written in a treaty; a treaty is what registers
the will of a conqueror--that is, the direction of his force for the
time being:
force, then, and right are the same thing; and if force is pleased to take
a new direction, the old right becomes ancient history and the treaty,
which backed it with a solemn undertaking, no more than a scrap of paper.
Thus Germany, struck with wonder in presence of her victories, of
the brute force which had been their means, of the material prosperity
which was the outcome, translated her amazement into an idea.

And see how, at the call of this idea, a thousand thoughts, as if
awaked from slumber, and shaking off the dust of libraries, came rushing
in from every side--thoughts which Germany had suffered to sleep among
her poets and philosophers, every one which could lend a seductive
or striking form to a conviction already made!
Henceforth German imperialism had a theory of its own. Taught in schools
and universities, it easily moulded to itself a nation already
broken-in to passive obedience and having no loftier ideal wherewith
to oppose the official doctrine.

"Thank you, Peter," he told the boy. "I'll get my hat and come."

Peter jerked his head. He seemed to be choking. "He's a-a-a-a-at his
office," he blurted.

Joel had found his hat. He closed the door of the house behind him, and
he and Peter went down the shady street together.

Asa Worthen was a small, lean, strong old man, immensely voluble. He must
have been well over sixty years old; and he had grown rich by harvesting
the living treasures of the sea. At thirty-four, he owned his first ship.
She was old, and cranky, and no more seaworthy than a log; but she earned
him more than four hundred thousand dollars, net, before he beached her
on the sand below the town. She lay there still, her upper parts strong
and well preserved. But her bottom was gone, and she was slowly rotting
into the sand.

Asa himself had captained this old craft, until she had served her
appointed time; but when she went to the sand flats, he, too, stayed
ashore, to watch his ships come in. When they were in harbor, they
berthed in his own dock; and from his office at the shoreward end of the
pier, he could look down upon their decks, and watch the casks come out,
so fat with oil, and the stores go aboard for each cruise. The cries of
the men and the wheeling gulls, the rattle of the blocks and gear, and
the rich smell of the oil came up to him.... The _Nathan Ross_ was
loading now; and when Joel climbed the office stairs, he found the old
man at the window watching them sling great shooks of staves into her
hold, and fidgeting at the lubberliness of the men who did the work.

Asa's office was worth seeing; a strange, huge room, windowed on three
sides; against one wall, a whaleboat with all her gear in place; in a
corner, the twisted jaw of a sixty-barrel bull, killed in the Seychelles;
and Asa Worthen's big desk, with a six-foot model of his old ship atop
it, between the forward windows. Beside the desk stood that contrivance
known to the whalemen as a "woman's tub"; a cask, sawed chair-fashion,
with a cross board for seat, and ropes so rigged that the whole might be
easily and safely swung from ship to small boat or back again. Asa had
taken his wife along on more than one of his early voyages ... before she
died....

At Joel's step, the little man swung awkwardly away from the window,
toward the door. Many years ago, a racing whale line had snarled his left
leg and whipped away a gout of muscle; and this leg was now shorter than
its fellow, so that Asa walked with a pegging limp. He hitched across the
big room, and took Joel's arm, and led the young man to the desk.

"Sit down, Joel. Sit down," he said briskly. "I've words to say to you,
my son. Sit down." Asa was smoking; and Joel took a twist of leaf from
his pocket, and cut three slices, and crumbled them and stuffed them into
the bowl of his black pipe. Asa watched the process, and he watched Joel,
puffing without comment. There was something furtive in the scrutiny of
the young man, but Joel did not mark it. When the pipe was ready, Asa
passed across a match, and Joel struck it, and puffed slowly....

Asa began, abruptly, what he had to say. "Joel, the _Nathan Ross_ will be
ready for sea in five days. She's stout, her timbers are good and her
tackle is strong. She's a lucky ship. The oil swims after her across the
broad sea, and begs to be taken. She's my pet ship, Joel, as you know;
and she's uncommon well fitted. Mark had her. Now I want you to take
her."

Joel's calm eyes had met the other's while Asa was speaking; and Asa had
shifted to avoid the encounter. But Joel's heart was pounding so, at the
words of the older man, that he took no heed. He listened, and he waited
thoughtfully until he was sure of what he wished to say. Then he asked
quietly:

"Is not James Finch the mate of her? Did he not fetch her home?"

"Aye," said Asa impatiently. "He brought her home--in the top scurry of
haste. There was no need of such haste; for he had still casks unfilled,
and there was sparm all about him where he lay. He should have filled
those last casks. 'Tis in them the profit lies." He shook his head
sorrowfully. "No, Jim Finch will not do. He is a good man--under another
man. But he has not the spine that stands alone. When Mark Shore was gone
... Jim had no thought but to throw the try works overside and scurry
hitherward as though he feared to be out upon the seas alone."

Joel puffed thrice at his pipe. Then: "You said this morning that for
three weeks he hunted Mark, up and down the Gilbert Islands."

Asa's little eyes whipped toward Joel, and away again. "Oh, aye," he said
harshly. "Three weeks he hunted, when one was plenty. If Mark Shore
lived, and wished to find his ship again, he'd have found her in a week.
If he were dead ... there was no need of the time wasted."

"Nevertheless," said Joel quietly, "James Finch has my thanks for his
search; and I'm no mind to do him a harm, or to step into his shoes."

Asa smiled grimly. "Ye're over considerate," he said. "Jim Finch was your
brother's man, and a very loyal one. As long as he is another's man, he
is content. But he has no want to be his own master and the master of a
ship, and of men. I've askit him."

Joel puffed hard at his pipe; and after a little he asked: "Sir, what
think you it was that came to Mark?"

Asa looked at him sharply, then away; and his accustomed volubility fell
away from him. He lifted his hands. "Ask James Finch. I've no way to
tell," he said curtly.

"Have you no opinion?" Joel insisted.

The ship owner tilted his head, set finger tip to finger tip, assumed the
air of one who delivers judgment. "Islanders, 'tis like," he said.
"There's a many there." He looked sidewise at Joel, looked away. Joel was
nodding.

"Yes, many thereabouts," he agreed. "But there would have been tracks.
Were there none?"

"Mark left his boat's crew," said Asa. "Walked away along the shore. That
was all."

"No tracks?"

"They saw where he'd left the sand." The ship owner shifted in his chair.
"Seems like I'd heard you and Mark wa'n't too good friends, Joel. Your
a'mighty worked up."

Joel looked at the little man with bleak eyes. "He was my brother."

"I've heard tell he forgot you was his, sometimes."

Joel paid no heed. "You think it was Islanders?"

Asa kicked the corner of his desk, watching his foot. "What else was
there?"

"I've nothing in my mind," said Joel, and shook his head. "But it sticks
in me that Mark was no man to die easy. There was a full measure of life
in him."

Asa got up awkwardly, waved his hand. "We're off the course, Joel. What
about the _Nathan Ross_? Ready for sea, come Tuesday. I'm not one to
press her on any man, unwilling. Say your say, man. Do you take her? Or
no?"

Joel drew slowly once more upon his pipe. "If I take her," he said,
"we'll work the Gilberts first of all, and try once again for a sign of
my brother Mark."

Asa jerked his head. "So you pick up any oil that comes your way, I've no
objection," he agreed. "Matter of fact, that's the best thing to do. Mark
may yet live." His eyes snapped up to the others. "You take her, then?"

Joel nodded slowly. "I take her, sir," he said. "With thanks to you."

Asa banged his hand jubilantly on his desk. "That's done. Now ..."

The two men sat down at Asa's big desk again; and for an hour they were
busy with matters that concerned the coming cruise. When a whaleship goes
to sea, she goes for a three-year cruise; and save only the items of food
and water, she carries with her everything she will need for that whole
time, with an ample allowance to spare. She is a department store of the
seas; for she works with iron and wood, with steel and bone, with fire
and water and rope and sail. What would happen, in long, if the moral
effort of humanity should become in its round at the climax of attaining
its end, and if some diabolical gadgetry should cause it to food the
computerization of tone instead of the spiritualization of concern?
Joel said to Finch slowly: "I've no mind to fight a grudge
aboard my ship, sir. If you blame me for stepping into your shoes, Mr.
Worthen will give you another berth."

Finch shook his head. He was a big, laughing man with soft, fat cheeks.
"No, sir," he declared. "It's yours, and welcome. Your brother was a man;
and you've the look of another, sir."

Joel frowned. He was uncomfortable; he had an angry feeling that Finch
was too amiable. But he said no more, and Finch went back to the ship,
and Asa and Joel continued with their task.

While they worked, the afternoon sun drifted down the western sky till
its level rays were flame lances laid across the harbor. A fishing craft
at anchor in mid-stream hoisted her sails with a creak and rattle of
blocks and drifted down the channel with the tide. The wheeling gulls
dropped, one by one, to the water; or they lurched off to some quiet cove
to spend the night. Their harsh cries came less frequently, were less
persistent. The wind had swung around, and it was fetching now from the
water a cold and salty chill. There was a smell of cooking in the air,
and the smoke from the _Nathan Ross_' galley, and the cool smell of the
sea mingled with the strong odor of the oil in the casks ranked at the
end of the pier.

The sun had touched the horizon when Joel at last rose to go. Asa got up
with him, dropped a hand on the young man's shoulder. They passed the
contrivance called a "woman's tub"; and Asa, at sight of it, seemed to be
minded of something. He stopped, and checked Joel, and with eyes
twinkling, pointed to the tub. "Will you be wishful to take that on the
cruise, Joel?" he asked, and looked up sidewise at the younger man, and
chuckled.

Joel's brown cheeks were covered with slow fire; but his voice was steady
enough when he replied. "It's a kind offer, sir," he said. "I know well
what store you set by that tub."

"Will you be wanting it?" Asa still insisted.

"I'll see," said Joel quietly. "I will see."


III


The brothers of the House of Shore had been, on the whole, slow to take
to themselves wives. Matt had never married, nor Noah, nor Mark. John had
a wife for the weeks he was at home before his last cruise; but he did
not take her with him on that voyage, and there was no John Shore to
carry on the name.

John Shore's widow was called Rachel. She had been Rachel Holt; and her
sister's name was Priscilla. Rachel was one of those women who suggest
slumbering fires; she was slow of speech, and quiet, and calm.... For.
a long time it; then it bent; of this young life, which was so then it
broke. Alas! had crushed under it, baby a multitude of our advance
without bruising that which lives, woman a and that great moral
results are purchased children; that spirit must encounter the by
much blood and one by the she over the fate naturally and purely
heroic, our tears will continue to wipeout and.

An implacable law decrees many tears. But this matter, that and life
cannot the sacrifice was in fruit as it had been rich in beauty and to
time resistance Rachel of be rich.
Thus the big boy and the
little girl had always been comrades and allies against the world. Before
Joel first went to sea, as ship's boy, the two had decided they would
some day be married....

Joel went to supper that night at Priscilla's home. He was alone in his
own house; and Mrs. Holt was a person with a mother's heart. Rachel lived
at home. She gave Joel quiet welcome at the door, before Priscilla in the
kitchen heard his voice and came flying to overwhelm him. She had been
making popovers, and there was flour on her fingers--and on Joel's best
black coat, when she was done with him. Rachel brushed it off, when Priss
had run back to her oven.
