_Fiend_.
To dream that you encounter a fiend, forbodes reckless living and
loose morals. For a woman, this dream signifies a blackened
reputation.
To dream of a fiend, warns you of attacks to be made on you by false
friends.The lawn was divided by a narrow middle gravel path, to
which you gained access from the portico of the house. You entered
upon a large flagged hall with a reception room on either hand, and
the staircase, a wide one, facing you; by the side of the staircase you
passed on to the servants' apartments and offices. That place was called
the Grove, and was the property and residence of Richard Hare, Esq.,
commonly called Mr. Justice Hare.

The room to the left hand, as you went in, was the general sitting-room;
the other was very much kept boxed up in lavender and brown Holland, to
be opened on state occasions. Justice and Mrs. Hare had three children,
a son and two daughters. Annie was the elder of the girls, and had
married young; Barbara, the younger was now nineteen, and Richard the
eldest--but we shall come to him hereafter.

In this sitting-room, on a chilly evening, early in May, a few days
subsequent to that which had witnessed the visit of Mr. Carlyle to the
Earl of Mount Severn, sat Mrs. Hare, a pale, delicate woman, buried
in shawls and cushions: but the day had been warm. Former colonial, still

"Well?"

"Would you please let me have tea in now? Would you very much mind
taking it a little earlier this evening? I am feverish again, and my
tongue is so parched I don't know how to speak."

"Oh, it's near seven; you won't have long to wait."

With this exceedingly gracious answer to an invalid's request, Mr. Hare
quitted the room again and banged the door. He had not spoken unkindly
or roughly, simply with indifference. But ere Mrs. Hare's meek sigh
of disappointment was over, the door re-opened, and the flaxen wig was
thrust in again.

"Oh, very well. What made you start off so suddenly? You never said you

"You have just expressed it, Barbara--'suddenly.' A matter of business
suddenly arose, and I suddenly went upon it."

"Cornelia said you were only gone for a day."

"Did she? When in London I find so many things to do! Is Mrs. Hare

"Just the same. I think mamma's ailments are fancies, half of them; if
she would rouse herself she would be better. What is in that parcel?"

"You are not to inquire, Miss Barbara. It does not concern you. It only
concerns Mrs. Hare."

"Is it something you have brought for mamma, Archibald?"

"Of course. A countryman's visit to London entails buying presents for
his friends; at least, it used to be so, in the old-fashioned days."

stayed ten minutes."

"But you forget I have not been at home."

"You were on your road to Beauchamp's, and would not have been at home
for an hour or two in that case," spoke Barbara, in a tone that savored
of resentment.

"That was different; that was upon business. But, Barbara, I think your
mother looks unusually ill."

"You know she suffers a little thing to upset her; and last night she
had what she calls one of her dreams," answered Barbara. "She says that
it is a warning that something bad is going to happen, and she has been
in the most unhappy, feverish state possible all day. Papa has been
quite angry over her being so weak and nervous, declaring that she ought

thing."With Hallijohn," assented Barbara, with a shiver. "He was standing
over him as he lay on the floor; just as he _did_ lay on it. And that
wretched Afy was standing at the end of the kitchen, looking on."

"But Mrs. Hare ought not to suffer dreams to disturb her peace by day,"
remonstrated Mr. Carlyle. "It is not to be surprised at that she dreams
of the murder, because she is always dwelling upon it; but she should
strive and throw the feeling from her with the night."

"You know what mamma is. Of course she ought to do so, but she does not.
Papa wonders what makes her get up so ill and trembling of a morning;
and mamma has to make all sorts of evasive excuses; for not a hint, as
you are aware, must be breathed to him about the murder."

Mr. Carlyle gravely nodded.

"Mamma does so harp about Bethel. And I know that dream arose from
nothing in the world but because she saw him pass the gate yesterday.
Presumably the principal "united we stand" applies to those 140 sovereign
states.

Sovereignty includes the right of self determination--putting the
interests of one particular state above the interests of the entire family
of nations--the part before the whole.

Here is a contradiction and a possible conflict of interest. Britain's
Prime Minister Heath, like many another spokesman in his position,
summed up the issue in the pithy phrase: "British interests come first."

If the French, Italian, Japanese and other prime ministers take a
similar stand, implied by the principle of sovereignty, situations
are bound to arise in which the interests of two or more nations
clash, opening the way for conflicts at many levels: differences
of interpretation, negotiations in the course of which concessions
may be made by both parties.

The differences may be settled by diplomats sitting around conference
tables or by armies on the battlefield.

With 140 sovereign states on the planet, the probability of conflict
would seem to be overwhelming.

As a matter of daily experience such confrontations and conflicts do
occur.

Most of them are handled by negotiation. A few lead to armed
struggle.

Since 140 sovereign states exist on one earth, means must
be found that will enable them to co-exist, if possible, without
conflict, and certainly without military conflict.

The means generally relied upon today for dealing with such problems is
negotiation between representatives of all parties at interest.

At the national level this would mean negotiations between representatives
of the involved governments.

Negotiations between representatives of various governments are
always going on--dealing with political, economic and cultural
issues.

Within each nation such negotiations are conducted between spokesmen
for various government departments.

Internationally they are conducted by representatives of various
governments working through their diplomatic or consular services.
Within each nation and between nations confrontations may be settled
by negotiation.

At each level they may result in armed conflict.

Governments exist to deal with conflicts and, where possible, to resolve
them before they reach the shooting stage. This is notably true in
domestic affairs because there are usually public officials charged
with the duty of dealing with problems.

Internationally, unless there is an international agency such as the
Universal Postal Union of the Organization of American States, the
issue must be settled by special representatives of the parties.

The argument for a world government begins with the assumption that
means should exist to deal with international issues before they
reach an acute stage.

Such means exist within each local government. Similar arrangements
should exist at the international level to deal with issues that
arise between governments.

Carlyle, had alternately teased and petted Anne and Barbara Hare, boy
fashion. Sometimes he quarreled with the pretty little girls, sometimes
he caressed them, as he would have done had they been his sisters; and
he made no scruple of declaring publicly to the pair that Anne was his
favorite. A gentle, yielding girl she was, like her mother; whereas
Barbara displayed her own will, and it sometimes clashed with young
Carlyle's.

The clock struck ten. Mrs. Hare took her customary sup of brandy and
water, a small tumbler three parts full. _Sculptor_. To will prevent
