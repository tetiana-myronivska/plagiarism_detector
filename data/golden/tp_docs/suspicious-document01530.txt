Stephen had a mind to say that he did not see why the meddling monk
should wish to see them at all, and Ambrose looked a little reluctant,
but Father Shoveller said in his good-humoured way, "As you please,
young sirs.  'Tis but an old man's wish to see whether he can do aught
to help you, that you be not as lambs among wolves.  Mayhap ye deem ye
can walk into London town, and that the first man you meet can point you
to your uncle--Randall call ye him?--as readily as I could show you my
brother, Thomas Shoveller of Cranbury.  But you are just as like to meet
with some knave who might cozen you of all you have, or mayhap a beadle
might take you up for vagabonds, and thrust you in the stocks, or ever
you get to London town; so I would fain give you some commendation, an I
knew to whom to make it, and ye be not too proud to take it."

"You are but too good to us, sir," said Ambrose, quite conquered, though
Stephen only half believed in the difficulties.  The Father took them
within the west door of the Minster, and looking up and down the long
arcade of the southern aisle to see that no one was watching, he
inspected the tokens, and cross-examined them on their knowledge of
their uncle.

No; he had never heard of one called Randall, neither in hat
nor cowl, but he knew more of them by face than by name, and more by by
name than surname or christened name.  He was certainly not the archer
who had brought a token for Mistress Birkenholt, and his comrades all
avouched equal ignorance on the subject.  Nothing could be gained there,
and while Father Shoveller rubbed his bald head in consideration,
Stephen rose to take leave.

"Look you here, my fair son," said the monk.  "Starting at this hour,
though the days be long, you will not reach any safe halting place with
daylight, whereas by lying a night in this good city, you might reach
Alton to-morrow, and there is a home where the name of Brother Shoveller
will win you free lodging and entertainment."

"And to-night, good Father?" inquired Ambrose.

"That will I see to, if ye will follow me."

Stephen was devoured with impatience during the farewells in the Castle,
but Ambrose represented that the good man was giving them much of his
time, and that it would be unseemly and ungrateful to break from him.

The convicts destined for this operation were kept in movement round a
post in an adjoining court, and were shouting, rarely in intelligible
language, to their companions.

Joy was the universal tone, and a sniveller ran imminent danger.
One poor fellow I remarked holding down his head, when he was
saluted with a kick from him who followed, and the objurgation, _Tu
es forçat, toi, heim?

_--"You a convict, and durst be sad." These men were all unmanacled.
Methought a general rush on their part both practicable and
formidable.

One half must have perished, and the other half might have escaped.

They were now marched out from the inner court in batches of thirty at
a time, drawn up in rank, stripped, and examined with such rigid scrutiny
as I dare not precise.
"It would be better for Spring to have a little more rest," thought
Stephen, thus mitigating his own longing to escape from the monks and
friars, of whom Winchester seemed to be full.
