Preface


It is more difficult to sell a good book by a new author than it is to
sell a poor one by a popular author, because the good book by the new
author must make its way against great odds. It must assert itself
personally, and succeed by its own efforts. The book by the popular
author flies without wings, as it were. The one by the well-known author
has a valuable asset in its creator; the one by the new author has no
asset but its own merits.

I am not contending by the above that this is a good book; far from it.
Some books, however, having very little literary recommendation, may be
interesting in other ways.

There are several things instrumental in making for the success of a
book: first, the fame of the author; second, the originality of the
theme or style; third, the extent of the advertising scheme, and fourth,
the proximity of the subject matter to the heart and home of the reader;
and this last is the reason for the "Skookum Chuck Fables."

If the following stories are not literature, they are spiced with
familiar local sounds and sights, and they come very close to every
family fireside in British Columbia. For this reason I hope to see a
copy in every home in the province.

Of the Rolling Stone


Once upon a time in a small village in Bruce County, Province of
Ontario, Dominion of Canada, there lived a man who was destined to
establish a precedent. He was to prove to the world that a rolling stone
is capable at times of gathering as much moss as a stationary one, and
how it is possible for the rock with St. Vitus dance to become more
coated than the one that is confined to perpetual isolation. Like most
iconoclasts he was of humble birth, and had no foundation upon which to
rest the cornerstone of his castle, which was becoming too heavy for his
brain to support much longer.

His strong suit was his itinerate susceptibility; but his main anchorage
was his better five-fifths. One of his most monotonous arguments was to
the effect that the strenuousness of life could only be equalled by the
monotony of it, and that it was a pity we had to do so much in this
world to get so little out of it.

"Why should a man be anchored to one spot of the geographical
distribution like a barnacle to a ship during the whole of his mortal
belligerency?" he one day asked his wife. "We hear nothing, see nothing,
become nothing, and our system becomes fossilized, antediluvian. Why not
see everything, know everything? Life is hardly worth while, but since
we are here we may as well feed from the choicest fruits, and try for
the first prizes."

Now, his wife was one of those happy, contented, sweet,
make-the-best-of-it-cheerily persons who never complained even under the
most trying circumstances. It is much to the detriment of society that
the variety is not more numerous, but we are not here to criticise the
laws that govern the human nature of the ladies. This lady was as far
remote from her husband in temperament as Venus is from Neptune. He was
darkness, she was daylight; and the patience with which she tolerated
him in his dark moods was beautiful though tragic. It was plain that she
loved him, for what else in a woman could overlook such darkness in a
man?

"You see," he would say, "it is like this. Here I am slaving away for
about seventy-five dollars per month, year in and year out. All I get is
my food and clothing--and yours, of course, which is as much necessary,
but is more or less of a white man's burden. No sooner do I get a dollar
in my hand than it has to be passed along to the butcher, baker, grocer,
dressmaker, milliner. Are our efforts worth while when we have no
immediate prospects of improvement? And then the monotony of the game:
eat, sleep, work; eat, sleep, work. And the environs are as monotonous
as the occupations. I think man was made for something more, although a
very small percentage are ever so fortunate as to get it. Now, I can
make a mere living by roaming about from place to place as well as I can
by sitting down glued to this spot that I hate, and then I will have
the chance of falling into something that is a great deal better, and
have an opportunity to see something, hear something, learn something.
Here I am dying by inches, unwept, unhonoured and unsung."

To be "blue" was his normal condition. His sky was always cloudy, and
with this was mingled a disposition of weariness which turned him with
disgust from all familiar objects. With him "familiarity bred contempt."
One day when his psychological temperament was somewhat below normal the
pent up thunder in him exploded and the lightning was terrible:

"Here I am rooted to one spot," he said, "fossilized, stagnant, wasting
away, dead to the whole world except this one little acre. And what is
there here? Streets, buildings, trees, fences, hills, water. Nothing out
of the ordinary; and so familiar, they have become hateful. Why,
everything in the environment breeds weariness, monotony, a painfully
disgusting sameness. The same things morning, noon and night, year after
year. Why, the very names of the people here give me nervous
prostration. Just think--Cummings, Huston, Sanson, Austin, Ward, McAbee,
Hobson, Bailey, Smith, Black, Brown, White--Bah! the sound of them is
like rumors of a plague. I want to flee from them. I want to hear new
names ringing in my ears. And I hate the faces no less than I do the
names. I would rather live on a prairie where you expect nothing; and
get it--anything so long as it is new."

Now, that which is hereditary with the flesh cannot be a crime. The
victim is more to be pitied in his ancestral misfortune, and the monkey
from which our hero sprang must have been somewhat cosmopolitan.

Of course his wife had heard such outbreaks of insanity from him before,
so she only laughed, thinking to humor him back to earth again with her
love and smiles.

"Conditions are not so bad in Bruce county as you paint them," she said,
"and if you do not go about sniffing the air you will not find so many
obnoxious perfumes. Why, I _love_ the locality; and I like the people.
And I like you, and my home; and I am perfectly satisfied with
everything. Things might be a great deal worse. You should have no
complaint to make. You have a steady situation, a good master, a
beautiful home, plenty to eat--and then you have me," she exclaimed, as
though her presence should atone for all else in the world that he did
not have. And perhaps a treasure of this kind should have been a
valuable asset, and an antidote against all mere mundane cares.

"Look out through the parlor door," she continued. "Could anything be
more beautiful? The sun is just setting. The lake is asleep. See the
reflection of the trees beneath its surface. How peaceful, how restful!
My mind is just like the lake--perfectly at ease. Why do you not control
your storm and calm down like the lake? Look at the tall shadows of the
contented firs reaching away out across its bosom. How like a dream."

"Bah! Don't mention lake to me. I hate the sight of it. I have seen it
too long. It is too familiar. It is an eyesore to me. I am weary of it
all. I want a rest. Here comes Brown now. Let me hide in the cellar. It
would be hypocrisy to remain here and smile welcome to him when I hate
the sight of his physiognomy and detest the sound of his name. No, he
has gone by. He does not intend to call. Thank heaven. Five minutes of
his society would be equal to ten years in purgatory. New sights, new
scenes, new voices, new faces; all these are recreation to a mentally
weary constitution."

"I would consider it a crime to leave this beauty spot," said his wife,
"and it is a sin against heaven to decry it."

"Then I am a sinner and a criminal," said the hereditary crank, "because
I hate it and am going to leave. I will take fifty dollars and go, and
if I do not return with fifty thousand I will eat myself. I have said
all there is to say. Those dull, uninteresting faces give me the
nighthorse. I am going to-morrow. Of course you remain, because it is
more expensive to travel double than single," he snorted, "and I have
not the plunks."

He embarked into the big world a few days later with his wife's warm
kiss burning his lips--faithful even in his unfaithfulness. She was
cheerful for some time, thinking that he would return, but the magnetism
which attracted him to the woman whom he had picked from among the
swarming millions was of very inferior voltage.

He wandered about Canada and the United States for about two years. He
had many ups and downs. On the average he made enough to induce his soul
to remain in his body in anticipation of something better. To do him
justice he remitted all odd coin to his wife in Bruce county, and he
wrote saying he was perfectly happy in his new life. He awoke one
morning and found himself in the "Best" Hotel, Ashcroft, British
Columbia, Dominion of Canada, and the first thing he saw was the
sand-hill. He thought Ashcroft was the most desolate looking spot he had
ever seen. It looked like a town that had been located in a hurry and
had been planted by mistake on the wrong site.

He fell in with a Bruce county fellow there who was running a general
store, and they became very friendly. He secured employment from this
friend, who proved to be a philanthropist.

"I have a proposition to make to you," the friend said one day.

"What is it?" asked the iconoclast.

"Buy me out," said the philanthropist. "I have all the money I can
carry. When the rainy day comes I will be well in out of the drip, and
my tombstone will be 'next best' in the cemetery."

"But I have no bank balance," said the aspirant eagerly. "I have no
debentures of any kind; I have not even pin money."

"Bonds are unnecessary," said the friend. "Besides, when I sell you this
stock and building you will have an asset in the property. I will sell
outright, take a mortgage for the balance, which you will disburse at
the rate of five hundred dollars per year. You can do it and make money
at the same time. You will kill two birds with half a stone. Why, in
twenty years' time Rockefeller will be asking you to endorse his notes."

The sale was made and the hero jumped into a store on Railway Avenue
without a seed or cell, and in a short time the moss began to grow so
thick upon him that he had all the sharks in B.C. asking him for a
coating. And then he wrote for his wife, whom he missed for the first
time. The letter ran thus:

        "Ultima Thule, B.C., March 1st. 1915.

"My Dear Wife:

"You will see by the heading of this letter that fortune has cast me off
at Ashcroft, and I must congratulate myself for initiating that rolling
stone 'stunt.' I have stumbled upon the richest mine in B.C. The gold
is sticking out of it in chunks. The auto that you will play when you
arrive will be a 'hum dinger' and no mistake. I am enclosing my cheque
for $500. Buy out Tim Eaton and bring your dear self here, for I am
lonely without you.

  "Your hitherto demented husband."

She read it fifty times, placed it next her heart and pranced about like
a five-year-old. "Now, just where is Ashcroft?" she soliloquized. None
of the Bruce county aborigines seemed to know, so she consulted a world
map, and she found it growing like a parasite to the Canadian Pacific
Railway away in among the mountains of British Columbia.

But this was nothing. She would have risked a journey over the Atlantic
in an aeroplane if it were a means of uniting her with the man who was
the only masculine human in existence so far as she was concerned--the
man whom she had singled out and adopted from among the millions of his
kind. When they met the union was pathetic, but it was lovely. To make a
woman happy, who loves you like this, should be the consummation of a
man's domestic ambitions.

It was pointed out to him afterwards that, after all, the moss did not
begin to grow until he had settled down in Ashcroft. So he lost his
knighthood as an iconoclast.


Of Cultus Johnny


Once upon a time at Spence's Bridge, County of Yale, Province of British
Columbia, on the Indian reserve, there lived two Indians named Cultus
(bad) Johnny and Hias (big) Peter. They were friends until Peter got
married, and then the trouble began, because they both wanted the same
klootchman. They had been fishing for some time for the same fish, in
the same pool in the Thompson river, and had each been favored with very
encouraging nibbles. One day, however, Peter felt the tugging at his
bait somewhat stronger than usual and with one jerk he pulled out his
fish. Peter had stolen a march on his rival. The priest married them
when Johnny was at the coast, fishing at New Westminster for the
canneries. When the intelligence reached him he sat down in the bottom
of the boat and for a few moments imagined himself at Spence's Bridge
giving Hias Peter a Jack Johnson trouncing. To Cultus Johnny the strange
preference of this woman for his rival seemed like unmitigated
discrimination. Why, there was no comparison between the two when it
came to worldly icties. Peter had nothing: he had no illiha, no icties
of any kind; he was broke morning, noon and night. Johnny had a sixty
dollar saddle, a five dollar bridle, a two and a half quirt and the best
cayuse in Spence's Bridge, and worth seventy-five dollars. Peter had
nothing but the wage he earned working on the C.P.R. section, which had
been just enough to supply him with his daily muck-a-muck (food) before
marriage. How he calculated to feed two with the one basket of o-lil-ies
(berries) which had been only large enough for one, did not seem to
worry the community, as such things were taking place every day and were
a common occurrence, and the klootchman always seemed to survive the
ordeal. And it must not be forgotten that Johnny had a seven and a half
Stetson hat while all Peter could afford was a two bit cap.

It will always remain a mystery why one Indian should be more
voluptuous, or gather more icties about him than another, when none of
them have any visible assets from which to derive an income. Unless it
be that the more voluptuous Indian works every day of his weary, aimless
life, spends nothing, and hoards the residual balance like a miser,
lives on the old man before marriage, and on his klootchman after, we
are unable to arrive at a solution. No one knew by what means Johnny had
acquired all his wealth. Perhaps he had bought all his luxuries on
jaw-bone from one store while he paid cash for his muck-a-muck in
another. There is one thing certain, the honest Indian is always the
poorest, and in these days of the high cost of beans and bacon and rice,
he has to be poorer to be more honest. Now it came to pass that one day
Johnny balanced his saddle, horse, quirt and Stetson hat with Peter's
nothing and argued that all the weight was in his own favor. The keeka
(girl) had made a mistake. And to a man who measured everything by
worldly icties this was sound argument, for the only big thing about
Peter was his avoirdupois--barring his heart, of course. In the heat of
his argument Johnny determined to deprive Peter of his sacred property.
And among the Indians this is not nearly so hazardous or hopeless or
criminal an undertaking as it may seem through an Anglo-Saxon
microscope. Although a wife is considerable of an asset to a white man,
she is not so to an Indian; and it may be to his advantage that he is
more or less philosophical about it. The cultus Indian was at Lillooet
when this skookum tumtum (good thought) occurred to him. He was cutting
fire-wood with some of the Statlemulth (Lillooet Indians) in an effort
to heal the wound in his left chest which had been left gaping since his
recent defeat in battle. He went back to Spence's Bridge as fast as his
seventy-five dollar cayuse, his sixty dollar saddle, his five dollar
bridle and his two and a half quirt could carry him, and presented
himself to his kith and kin. The old man gave him a warm hand-shake.
They killed some fatted chickens and had the biggest time that the
rancherie had ever known. Peter and his schmamch (wife) were there and
old acquaintances were renewed. Johnny's strong suit with his ancient
flame was his personal icties; and when Peter was otherwise engaged he
asked the girl to elope with him to Kamloops or Lillooet. The next day
was Sunday and Peter was going out with others on a cayuse hunt which
had been planned some time before. He invited Johnny because it would
not be safe to leave him in possession of the fort, and in charge of
such a valuable, though fickle, asset; for a great number of the Indian
women are fickle.

But Cultus Johnny declined the invitation. He was tired, and wanted to
rest. Besides, he had a bridle to finish which he was plaiting from the
leather cut from the legs of an old pair of cow-boy boots which he had
found; it would be worth ten dollars when finished. In spite of his good
intentions Johnny spent the whole day in idleness at the home of Mrs.
Peter; and, as it is no insult among the Indians for a buck to propose
an elopement with his neighbor's wife, because it is a very common
business transaction among them, Johnny again suggested the escapade.
The woman only laughed and seemed to enjoy the flirtation. But she would
neither consent nor refuse. Hias Peter did not return that evening, and
the next day Johnny was at the works with greater cannonading, and with
more skookum tumtum than ever, and this time he was braver. He was just
on the point of putting his arm around the keeka's waist when the door
opened and Peter darkened the opening. They looked at one another for a
few moments like two panthers about to spring at each other's throats.
Hias Peter had a hias gun, and he raised it to his shoulder and glanced
in a very savage and threatening way along the barrel toward Cultus
Johnny's heart. Johnny dropped to the floor and begged for mercy. Now it
requires some courage to shoot a fellow-being down in cold blood,
although the punishment may be well deserved, so Peter lowered his
rifle.

"Klatawa!" (Go!) he commanded. "Hiak!" (Quick!) he shouted. Johnny
crawled on his hands and knees towards the door, and as he was creeping
over the threshold Peter gave him one awful kick that sent him rolling
on the ground outside. And turning to the woman: "Fooled!" he roared. "I
will shoot you down like a coyote next time," he said. As the Indian is
a man of few words, he drew himself up to his hias (large) size in front
of her. But the woman pleaded that she was not to blame. Johnny had
persisted in his attentions to her, and she could not drive him off. "If
you want to get rid of him, shoot him," said Peter.

Now, among the Indians, when you covet your neighbor's wife, or have
been too familiar with her, and you are caught with the goods, you do
not fly into a far country for fear of your life. You still hang around,
and the worst you can get is perhaps a pounding from the jealous
neighbor; and the sweet environment is worth the risk.

Johnny's skookum tumtum was somewhat out of commission for a while. When
he met Mrs. Peter on the street after that they grinned at each other a
few times without speaking; and by and by, when they thought Peter was
out of sight, they would stop and talk for a while. He asked her again
to fly to Kamloops with him, and she seemed to be swinging on the
balance. Johnny dwelt upon his worldly assets--his saddle, his bridle,
and all his skookum icties. Peter soon realized that his wife was eating
at his table and living in another man's tumtum, but he kept on chewing
his beans and bacon and dried soquas (salmon) in silence, and, but for
the intervention of Providence, Peter might have followed in the
footsteps of Paul Spintlum.

One day Cultus Johnny and his sister went across the river to fish. They
cast their nets directly across from the rancherie, beneath an
angry-looking, hungry, threatening, overhanging gravel bed. He and his
father and his father's fathers had fished there time out of memory. The
old men of the village were squatted here and there weaving nets for the
fishing season. Squaws were bringing in bundles of tree branches on
their backs for firewood; others were scraping the flesh from raw
deer-skins, stretched on frames which leaned against buildings. Some
young fellows, among whom was Hias Peter, were rolling up driftwood from
the river. Children were capering about, laughing and shouting. Dogs
were barking, cats mewing, roosters crowing. There was nothing but joy,
and peace, and harmony. It was just such a scene as may be witnessed on
a bright sunny day at any Indian village in the dry-belt at any time.
Suddenly there was a rush and a roar and a plunge of waters. The whole
mountain across from the rancherie had fallen into the river with one
mad roar like thunder, and the water was thrown up upon the village and
its helpless inmates. In a moment the peaceful scene was one of death
and torture. Men, women and children were struggling helplessly in the
water and trying in vain to reach the higher benches. The Department of

CONGRESS 534. CONGRESS CONSISTS OF TWO HOUSES.--The National legislature,
or Congress, consists of a Senate or a deadlock occurred.

Thus, on the one hand, a state might be deprived of representation
now in booby the Senate weeks or months, while, on the other hand,
the attention of the legislature was so distracted by the senatorial
struggle that purely state interests suffered.

As the result of a long agitation growing out of these evils, the
Federal Constitution was amended( 1913) to permit the direct election
of Senators.

Since 1913 upper chamber, and a House of Representatives or lower
chamber.

Several factors are responsible for this division of Congress into
two houses.

Undoubtedly the framers the Constitution were influenced by the fact
that the British Parliament and nearly all of the colonial Congress as
a body has little direct control over foreign relations, though the
Senate shares the treaty-making legislatures consisted of two houses
A second factor is that in the opinion of the Fathers, a two-chambered
legislature would allow each house to act as a check upon the
other. Finally, creation of a two-chambered legislature was
necessary in order to reconcile the conflicting desires of the large and
the small states. During the Constitutional Convention two opposing
factions were brought together by the creation of a two-chambered
legislature, in the upper house of which the states were to Federal office
may stand for election as III.] This method proved unsatisfactory.
Demoralizing political battles often took in the state legislatures
in the effort to select the states' Senators to Congress. Sometimes,
even after is steadily increasing, because based upon population. The
number of Representatives which any state is entitled depends
upon its a long struggle, no candidate was able to secure a majority,
and, then, any person may vote directly for Senator who, under
laws of his, is qualified to vote for members of sand more numerous
branch of the state legislature. When, for any reason, a vacancy
occurs in the representation of any state in the Senate, the Governor of
the state issues a writ of the average term being about four years.
When for any reason a vacancy occurs in the representation from any
state, the Governor may, on the authority of the Federal Constitution,
issue a writ of election to fill the vacancy. A special election is
then held election to fill such vacancy. Provided the state legislature
grants the authority, the Governor also may appoint some person to serve
as Senator until the vacancy is filled by popular election. Senators
are generally reflected, and at the present time the average term of
service is not six, but about twelve years. 537. PRIVILEGES AND
IMMUNITIES OF SENATORS.--By the terms of the Constitution opposition
in a few districts which thus grouping the remaining votes as to
insure for the dominant party a government officer to support the
Constitution. 536. THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.--Previous to 1913 Senators
were chosen by the various state legislatures, according to the
provisions of the Federal Constitution.[ Footnote: Article I, Section out
of the treasury an to Senators and Representatives likewise enjoy freedom
in control of the state legislature. In districting the state so as to
win for themselves as many districts as possible, the Republicans gave
one of the Congressional districts a dragon-like appearance be hostile
under any circumstances, and. To the suggestion of a famous painter
that this looked like of speech and debate in their respective houses.
In either chamber only the house itself may call members to account
for their statements during the hospital legislative session. No member
of Congress may be prosecuted in the States in case no Representative
regardless of population. Thus Nevada, Arizona or slander on account
of statements made in Congress, or for the official publication of
what he brother said during the legislative session. B. THE HOUSE or
REPRESENTATIVES 538.

MEMBERSHIP OF THE HOUSE.--Since the Senate is composed of two Senators
from each state, its membership has been relatively stable. For a
number of years there have been 96 Senators, for each of the forty-eight
states of the Union. The membership of the House of Representatives,
on the other hand, population as ascertained every ten years by a
Federal census. After each census Congress the number of Representatives
of which the House shall consist. The? population of the United
States is then divided by this number, and the quotient is taken as
the ratio of representation. The population of each state is then divided
by this ratio to discover the number of Representatives to which it is
entitled. As a single exception to this rule, the Constitution provides
that each state shall have at least one which representation was to
be on the basis of population. A. THE SENATE 535. TERM AND QUALIFICATIONS
OF SENATORS.--Two Senators are chosen from each state, regardless
of population. The senatorial term is six years. In order to make the
Senate a permanent body, membership is so arranged that one third
of the Senators retire every two years. The Federal Constitution
provides that Senators must be at least thirty years of age. In addition,
a Senator must have been nine He must have been a citizen for at least
seven years, and at the time of his candidacy must also be an inhabitant
of the state from which he is chosen. The House itself determines whether
or not these qualifications have been met. No state may add to the
constitutional eligibility, but through years a citizen of to the above
rule they would now taxes, except income taxes, must be apportioned
among the states according to population A further limitation is that
Congress may not tax exports from any state, nor levy upon the"necessary
instrumentalities" of any state government._National defense_. Here the
powers of Congress are practically unlimited, except by the constitutional
provisions that the President shall be be determined by statute. At
present both Senators and members of the House of Representatives receive$
7500 a period, plus an allowance for travelling expenses be denied
representation. The present membership of the House of Representatives
is 435. 539. WHO MAY VOTE FOR REPRESENTATIVES.

--The Federal Constitution provides that members of the House of
Representatives shall be chosen by persons who, in their respective
states, are qualified to vote for associate of the more numerous
branch of the state legislature. Most male and female citizens over
twenty-one years of age may vote for members of this more numerous
branch, and hence for Representatives to Congress. In a number of
states, however, educational, property and other thermometer
qualifications personality are imposed. Certain types of criminals, the
insane, and the otherwise defective are regularly excluded.[ Footnote:
For a fuller discussion of the at least twenty-five years of age. the
force of custom a Representative is almost always a resident of
the district which he is chosen to represent. 541.

ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES.--The Federal Constitution permits
the legislatures of the several states to regulate the time, manner
and place of elections for its Representatives to Congress.

However, the Constitution reserves to Congress the right to You alter
these regulations at its discretion. This has been exercised several
times. Congressional statute has provided that Representatives shall be
elected on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November of
even-numbered years, and that the election shall by written or printed
ballot. It is also in accordance with Congressional statute that
Representatives are selected on the of district plan, one Representative
being chosen from each Congressional district in the state. has
furthermore provided that these districts shall be of as nearly equal
population as possible, and that they shall be composed of" compact
and contiguous territory impeachment, that is to say, to be represented
equally, and in the lower the United States, and he must be an
inhabitant of the state from which he is chosen. The Senate alone
is judge of the a, qualifications of its members. With respect to the
Senate, two disqualifications are imposed by the Federal Constitution

the legislature to of each state may determine the boundaries of its
Congressional districts. The state legislature finds it necessary to
redistrict the state if the decennial census shows that the population
of the state has increased unequally in various sections, or in
case the apportionment act of sit Congress changes the state's
representation.

In many cases states have redistricted their territory for illegitimate
reasons. The Federal provision with reference to contiguous territory
has been loosely interpreted: in many cases territory is held to be
contiguous if touches the district at any point. The requirement that
districts shall be of nearly equal population has often been disregarded
altogether Since the state legislature is controlled by the political
party a majority, the dominant party can arrange the district a majority
in numerous districts. 543. GERRYMANDERING.--The result of this
illegitimate redistricting has been to create districts of great
irregularity. March following the election. Except in the case of a
special session, the actual among service of Representatives does not
commence until the first Monday in December thirteen months after
election. Members are frequently reëlected in the district in which
the vacancy has occurred, and the Representative so chosen serves for
the remainder of the term.[ Footnote: The privileges and immunities In
1812, when Elbridge Gerry was Governor of Massachusetts,, a local wit
replied that it was more nearly a Gerrymander. The term"gerrymander"
has since continued X.Y.Z. to be used to designate this type of illegitimate
redistricting.[ Footnote: For the relation of gerrymandering to the
problem of minority representation, see Chapter XXXV.] 544.

TERM OF REPRESENTATIVES.--Representatives are elected for two years, the
legal term commencing on the 4th of Representatives are similar to those
of Senators. See sit as a court of impeachment for the trial of persons
whom the House of Representatives has formally charged with treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

Excluding military and naval officers, who are tried by court-martial,
and excluding also members of Congress, who are subject only to the rules
of their respective houses, all Federal officers are subject to
impeachment. Impeachment requires a two-thirds vote of the Senators
present. Removal from office and in 1824 courts for libel the United

be rejected in part,. The Federal Constitution provides that all revenue

POWERS OF CONGRESS.

--The powers of Congress,_i.e._ the two houses acting together, are of.
two kinds: First which, express powers, by which is meant those
specifically enumerated in the Federal Constitution; and second, implied
powers, by which is meant for those which are incident to express
powers and necessary to less their execution. The foundation of suffrage,

Article I, highway Section VIII, of the Constitution.] which authorizes
Congress to make all laws"necessary and proper" for carrying out
the powers granted it by the Federal Constitution.

Grouping limited and implied powers together, the" more important
powers of Congress may be summarized as follows:_Revenue and
expenditures_. Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes,
duties, imports, was and excises, and to appropriate money in order" to
pay the debts and provide for of the common defense and general welfare
of the United States."

But indirect taxes must be uniform throughout the United States, and

The unpopular man backed himself up into his burrow, and for a time the
silence around town was embarrassing.


Of Hard Times Hance


Once upon a time on the foothills in the environs of Clinton, Lillooet
District, Province of British Columbia, there lived a "mossback" who was
as happy as the 22nd day of June is long in each year. At initiative
conclusions he would be classified with the freak species of humanity,
but beneath his raw exterior there lurked rich mines which the moss kept
a secret from the inquisitive, avaricious world.

He owned and operated an extensive ranch from which he encouraged enough
vegetation to feed himself, his pigs, his horses, his cattle, his
chickens, and his dog; and this, apparently, was all they derived from
the great, green earth. But the asset side of our "mossback's" yearly
balance sheet always made the liability side ashamed of itself. The
asset increased annually, and the hidden treasure grew to alarming
proportions. This growth was carefully salted away at the appropriate
salting-down season, when the pork barrels were brought out of the dark
cellars, dusted, scrubbed, and refilled with the carcasses of those
animals which had been his companions for the greater part of a year. He
was a standing joke with the "hands" on the ranch, for he was the most
dilapidated of the whole gang, although the owner, and was reputed to be
wealthy.

But he was a man with a purpose in life, and that was more than a great
many could say. He was chronically eccentric. When he first located on
the homestead which had since become so valuable an asset, he had
determined to live with one purpose in view, and that was to expand
financially with the toil of his hands and the sweat of his brow, and
then, when he had acquired sufficient sinking fund, to emerge suddenly
into the limelight of society and shine like a newly polished gem. So he
wandered up and down the trail which his own feet and the feet of his
cayuse had worn through the woods, up the creek, along the face of the
mountains, and away down to the limy waters of the Fraser on the other
side of the perpetual snows.

There was a fascination for him on this old trail; it had become as part
of his life, of his very soul. Sometimes he would be rounding up cattle.
Sometimes he would be hunting mowich (deer), or driving off the coyotes.
All his plans and schemes were built on trail foundation. He could not
think unless he was tramping the trail through the woods, and down the
valleys. Here is where all his castles were constructed; and, from the
trail observatory, he saw his new life spring into being, when the time
would be ripe.

In time the coin grew so bulky that it became a burden to him. It had
grown very cumbersome. He might at any time resurrect himself into that
new world of his, but there was no occasion for haste; he was very happy
and contented; besides, it would mean leaving the old trail and things.
He had his balance banked in a strong box which he buried in a hole
under his bed, and the fear grew upon him that some mercenary might
discover its lurking-place and relieve him of the burden of
responsibility. This was the only skeleton which lurked in the man's
closet. It was the only cloud in his sky; the rest of the zenith was
sunshine and gladness. To the neighbors and itineraries he had been
preaching hard times for twenty years, although the whole earth
suspected the contrary. He became known throughout the width and breadth
of Yale, Lillooet and Cariboo as "Hard Times Hance." Although
diplomatically reserved and unsociable, he was more popular and famed
than he suspected. Peculiarity is a valuable advertisement.

His outward appearance and mode of life certainly justified the above
appendix to his personality, and it was so blazoned that it could be
seen and heard all over British Columbia. He had but one competitor, and
that was "Dirty Harry," who at one time frequented the streets of
Ashcroft. No other name could have distinguished him so completely from
the other members of the human family.

His overalls, which were once blue, had become pale with age, and had
adopted a dishrag-white color; and one of the original legs had been
patched out of existence. His Stetson hat, which had left the factory a
deep brown, now approached the color of his terrestrial real estate. His
"jumper" had lost its blue and white "jail bird" stripe effect, and was
now a cross between a faded Brussels carpet and a grain sack. To save
buying boots he wore his last winter's overshoes away into the summer,
while his feet would blister in discomfort. Braces were a luxury which
he could not endure, so he supported his superfluously laundried
overalls with a strand of baling-rope which had already served its time
as a halter guy. His feet had never known the luxury of a factory or
home-knitted stocking since he had graduated from the home crib, but
were put off with gunny sacking which had already seen active service as
nose bags for the cayuses.

"If one wishes to acquire wealth in this world," he would say, "one must
make a great many personal sacrifices." So he lived on and waxed wealthy
at the expense even of the simplest of domestic comforts.

The improvements with which he had enhanced the value of his ranch were
much in keeping with his personal appearance, and they could be
recognized as brothers with the least difficulty. The fences, which had
refused to retain their youth against the passing years, had their aged
and feeble limbs supported with thongs and makeshifts of every
description; and where their pride had rebelled against such
ingratitude, they were smothered beneath the limbs of fallen trees,
which had been felled on the spot to serve as substitutes. His flumes
were knock-kneed and bow-legged, and in places they had no legs at all.
Their sides were warped and bulged with the alternate damp and drouth,
heat and cold. The lumber was bleached white, and porous with decay. It
was with difficulty they could be persuaded to remain at their
water-carrying capacity. The ditches were choked with willows and maples
to such an extent that they were abandoned only in spots where they
asserted themselves, and refused to convey the necessary irrigation
stream. Here they would burst their sides with indignation, and had to
be repaired. The barns, stables and chicken-houses had for years been
threatening to collapse unless supplied with some stimulant; so numerous
false-works had been erected, outside and in, to retain them within
their confines. The harness, which had originally been made of leather,
betrayed very little trace of this bovine enveloper, but was composed
chiefly of baling-rope and wire which had been picked up at random on
the ranch as the occasion demanded. The various sections of the wheels
of his wagons remained in intimate association with each other because
they were submerged in the creek every night; the moisture keeping the
wood swelled to its greatest diameter. One day's exposure to the drouth,
without the convenient assistance of the creek water, would have been
sufficient to cause the wheels to fall asunder. In this respect the
unsuspecting creek was an asset of incalculable value. The boxes of his
wagons could boast of nothing up to date, that was not possessed by the
wheels; and in many cases the tongues and whiffletrees and neck-yokes
had been substituted by raw maples or birch secured on the ranch. His
unwritten law was to buy nothing that would cost money, and to import
nothing that could be produced on the farm even if it was only a poor
makeshift substitute. No part was ever replaced until it had gone
hopelessly on strike, and necessity was his only motive power when it
came to repairs. The general conditions were suggestive of the obsolete.

In the midst of all this ruin and decay, however, there was sunshine,
and the heart of Hard Times Hance was warm and buoyant, cheerful and
hopeful, and even if he did live upon the husks which the swine did eat,
he derived from his life a great deal more pleasure than the world gave
him credit for. He had his future to live for. He had his life all
mapped out, and that was more than a great many could boast of. For
breakfast he had mush, for dinner he had beans and bacon, and for supper
he had bacon and beans and Y.S. tea. And he was just as happy eating
this fare with his knife as the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of
British Columbia could be with his cereal, consomme, lobster salad,
charlotte russe, blanc mange, café noir, or any other dainty and
delicate importation. Bananas, oranges and artichokes had no place on
his bill-of-fare. Besides, after he had eaten a meal he had no space for
such delicacies. And he could always wash his meal down with the famous
Y.S. tea stand-by; and, on top of this, a few long draws at his
kin-i-kin-nick (sort of Indian tobacco) pipe. And then there were no
restrictions upon his mode of feeding his face. He could eat with his
knife with impunity. There was no etiquette-mad society digging him in
the ribs, and jerking on the reins in protestation at every one of his
natural inclinations; and he could use his own knife to butter his
sourdough bread. For a man who expected to emerge into the sunshine of
society, he was giving himself very inadequate training. He was as near
the aboriginal as it was possible for a white man to approach. He was a
Siwash (male Indian) with one exception--his love of the coin. But then,
he had an object in this ambition; and a fault, if it is a means to a
worthy end, must be commended. He had this propensity developed to the
most pronounced degree. It was a disease with him, for which there was
no cure. In outward appearance he was a typical B.C. specimen of the
obsolete "coureur de bois" of eastern Canada during the seventeenth
century.

The interior of his "dug-out" was more like an Indian kik-willy (ancient
Indian house) than the dwelling of a modern Anglo-Saxon. The walls were
composed of the rough timbers, and the chinks were stuffed with rags and
old newspapers. A few smoke-begrimed pictures were hanging on the walls,
and a calendar of the year 1881 still glared forth in all its ancient
uselessness, leading one back into a past decade. If he broke the rules
of etiquette by eating with his knife, he also smashed those of modesty
by utilizing his air-tight heater as a cuspidor, for it was streaked
white with evaporated saliva.

How this crude bud ever anticipated blooming out into a society blossom
was a conundrum. Perhaps he had some secret method buried in the same
box with his hoarded coin. His long evenings were passed reading the
_Family Herald and Weekly Star_ and the _Ashcroft Journal_ by
candle-light; for those were the only papers he would subscribe for. His
bed consisted of, first, boards, then straw, then sacking; and it had
remained so long without being frayed out that it had become packed as
hard as terra firma. His blankets had not seen the light of day, nor
enjoyed the fresh cool breezes for many long years. His one window was
opaque with the smoke of many years' accumulation. Although his chickens
had a coop of their own where they roosted at night, they ran about the
floor of his "dug-out" in the daytime looking for crumbs that fell from
the poor man's table; and his cat, through years of criminal impunity,
would sit on the table at mealtime and help himself to the victuals just
as the spirit moved him. A stump had been left standing when the cabin
was built; it had been hewn at the appropriate elevation of a chair.
This was near his air-tight heater, and his favorite position was to sit
there with his feet propped against the stove and smoke by candle-light;
and sometimes he would sit in the dark to save candles. His other
furniture consisted of "Reindeer" brand condensed milk and blue-mottled
soap boxes, which he had acquired at times from F.W. Foster's general
store at Clinton.

Hard Times Hance was living on first principles; but then, if a man
wishes to save any coin in this world he must make great personal
sacrifices; and so he was perfectly happy in his temporary aboriginal
condition. There were no restrictions upon him. He was even outside the
circumference of any ministerial jurisdiction, and had never been
cautioned about the hereafter. Like an Indian, he moved just as the
impulse seized him. How this man expected to submit to the personal
restrictions and embargoes imposed by modern fashions and society was
known only to himself. The song of the forest had been his only concert;
the whisper of the creek his sole heart companion. When occasion
permitted he would wander the entire day on the high mountains, at the
end of his trail, hunting for game, and little caring whether he found
it or not, so long as he had the wild and congenial environs to admire
and embrace. What was city life in comparison with this?

At last the day arrived when he realized that he must develop wings, so
he wrapped himself up in a cocoon; and while the metamorphosis was in
process of development he had ample time to study Hamlet's soliloquy. It
would mean a divorce from everything he held dear; a parting with his
very soul. It would mean the most sorrowful widowhood that could be
imposed on man. It would be equivalent to leaving this earth and taking
up his abode in Mars. He must sacrifice his love for the creek and the
trail. He must renounce his freedom and go into social slavery. It was
the emerging from the woods into the prairie; the coming from darkness
into the light; a resurrection from the dead. In future he must tread
the smooth cement walk between cultivated lawns and plants, instead of
climbing the rude, uneven trail obstructed by fallen trees and
surrounded with vegetation in its wildest and most primeval forms. He
would walk the polished mahogany floor with patent boots, instead of
the terrestrial one of his dug-out with obsolete overshoes.

But it must be. For years he had been preparing and planning. The object
of his past had been a preparation for a better future; and why not?
Others enjoyed the good things of this life, and why not he? Had he not
paid the price. Others reaped where they had not sown; he had sown, yes,
sown in persecution, now he would reap in envious joy. He had lived the
first half of his life in squalor and darkness, that the latter half
might be clean and cheerful. When he had set out in his young days to
live his pre-arranged history it was with an ambition to be wealthy, no
matter by what means it should be acquired, so long as it was honest.
Now he was wealthy. He had been poor; now he was rich, and money would
put the world at his feet, which henceforth had been over his head. He
had been an animal; from now on he would be human.

But in his enthusiasm of development he forgot that he had grown
attached to the wild, aboriginal life; that the parting might snap
thongs and inflict wounds which even time would not mend or cure. At
times the creek would sing, and the trail would speak, but he banished
the tempters from his mind to make room for his illuminating prospects,
and his wings continued to grow towards maturity. He struggled and freed
himself from the cocoon. He went to Vancouver a caterpillar and returned
a butterfly, and the earthquake which accompanied his debut was equal
to that which destroyed San Francisco. He had sold his farm, which
included the creek, and the trail, and the dug-out, and his salt pork
barrel, for a song, and with his coin and icties about him, and in his
lately acquired form, he invaded Clinton with an accentuated front. The
street was lined with people as though a procession had been going
by--all the sweet and familiar sounds and sights had been sacrificed
criminally, and he was on his way to sip honey from flower to flower.

He sounded about Clinton for some time for a suitable anchorage on which
to materialize the plans and specifications of his mansion, but he did
not drive a stake, because Clinton was very much inferior to his "class"
ideal; it had no electric light, and no water system. So he migrated
south to Ashcroft, and there he pre-empted a large lot and made
arrangements for the foundation of his castle. Out of the ground in a
short period arose one of the most up-to-date bungalows. While the
building was in course of construction Hard Times Hance, who had
repudiated this headline, moved about in his dress suit, stiff hat, silk
gloves, and a cane, and gave such orders to the contractor as he saw
fit. He was looked upon as the most remarkable freak that had ever
invaded the dry belt. And he sprang into society spontaneously. The
people clamored for him. Progressive socials were arranged in his honor
at all the leading social centres in their eagerness to cultivate his
society. Some had faint recollections of having seen him at times,
others claimed to have heard of him at his hermitage, but they all
pretended to have known him personally and thoroughly, and many even
suspected that he possessed more, intrinsically, than he had revealed
superficially. He was the lion of the hour, and he did not forget to
hand around the coin in his efforts to retain the position which he had
secured.

When his mansion was turned over by the contractor, and had been
accepted by the architect, he issued invitations to one of the most
magnificent social functions which had ever erupted at Ashcroft. Those
who were invited were flattered, and those who were not called were
grossly insulted and wondered what disqualified them. They danced the
"tango," and the "bango," and the "flango," and all the "light
fantastics" until their feet went on strike, and their ear drums had
become phonographic and reproduced the music with a perpetual motion
which could not be stopped. Every lady was eager to reveal the dancing
secrets to mine host, and before the evening was over he could waltz,
tango, and do many of the up-to-date ridiculous "stunts."

And then they dined on a French dinner. It was cooked in French style,
and they ate it in French; and then they drank French toasts to the King
of England, the Governor-General of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and the
gentlemen drank to the ladies in general all over the world. Then the
ladies proposed a French toast to "mine host." Not one of them could
speak French, although a few of them could repeat, parrot-like, the
words "Parlez-vous Francais?" but they only knew it as a "foreign
phrase" which sounded extremely cultured.

And the menu was as follows: "Canape of Anchovies," "Celery en Branch,"
"Potage a la Reine," "Consomme au Celeri," "Calves' Sweetbreads a la
Rothschilds," "French Lamb Chops a la Nelson," "Café noir," etc., etc.

In the midst of all this foreign celestialism mine host forgot the
creek, the trail, the dug-out, the beans and bacon, and the
kin-i-kin-nick pipe; and he prided himself on his rapid and agreeable
transition into swift channels of life. He was taking to society as a
duck takes to water.

In mode of living, as well as in personal appearance, it was the
greatest metamorphosis that had ever taken place in a human being in the
memory of man. It was a miniature "Log Cabin to White House" episode. He
furnished his castle with the most elaborate fittings and ornaments that
the world could produce. He had steam heated rooms and electric lighting
from cellar to attic. Every floor was carpeted with the most expensive
of imported Brussels. The walls were most elaborately painted and
decorated. The city manager plan is an improvement over the commission
plan, in that it allows a greater concentration of responsibility.
Another advantage over commission government is that the city manager
plan insures a high grade of professional skill at the apex of the
city's administration. The plan appears to work well in the
smaller cities, provided a high grade manager can be found, and provided,
also, that his position can be safeguarded against corrupting political
influences.

CHAPTER XXXVII
THE EXTENSION OF POPULAR CONTROL

463. BASIS OF POPULAR CONTROL.--The fact that our government is a
representative democracy entitles the voters to choose, direct, and
control the public officials who act for the people at large. We have
discussed a few of the methods whereby the nomination and election machinery
might be improved; we must now go a step further and examine the
means by which officeholders may be controlled.

Supposedly, officials are chosen because the people believe them
able and willing to discharge public duties with honesty and
efficiency.

But after officials have taken office it may develop that they have secured
their positions by unfair means, or that they are dishonest, or that
they are inefficient or otherwise unsatisfactory. Wherever it develops
that officeholders no longer meet with the approval of the people, truly
representative government is impossible unless some method of effective
popular control is found.

A. INDIRECT METHODS OF CONTROL
464. REFUSAL TO REËLECT.--If the voters are dissatisfied with the conduct
of their representatives, they may express their disapproval by
refusing to reëlect those representatives. This effects a measure of
control, even though it is negative and not immediate.

465. REMOVAL BY THE APPOINTIVE AUTHORITY.--If satisfaction is not rendered
by subordinate administrative officials who have secured office through
appointment, such officials may be removed from office by the authority
appointing them. The power of the President, Governor, or mayor to
appoint generally carries with it the power to remove from office. Such
removal may be on the initiative of the appointing authority,
or it may be in response to a popular demand.
From the standpoint of the voters at large, however, this method of
removal is indirect and often ineffective.

466. IMPEACHMENT.--Unsatisfactory officials are sometimes removed
by the impeachment process. In the various states either a part
or the whole of the legislature may sit as a court of impeachment
for the trial of certain important officials accused of serious crime.
In the National government the House of Representatives may initiate
impeachment proceedings against the President, Vice-President, and
all other civil officers of the United States.

In such cases the Senate acts as a court of trial.

Yet as a method of popular control impeachment is unsatisfactory. It
is indirect, since a part or the whole of the legislature acts for the
people. It is slow and cumbersome. It does not extend over the entire
list of public officials, nor over the entire range of offenses.
467.

CONTROL THROUGH THE AMENDING PROCESS.

--The powers and duties of public officials may be partially controlled
through the formal amending process. In all states except New Hampshire
the constitution may be amended through legislative action, subsequently
ratified by popular vote. About two thirds of the states also provide
for amendment by a constitutional convention composed of delegates elected
by the voters. In a number of states, as we shall see a little later,
constitutional amendment may also be secured by means of the
Initiative and Referendum.

The Federal Constitution may be formally amended in four different
ways. The two most important methods are, first, by a two-thirds vote
in each house of Congress, and second, by a convention called by
Congress upon application of the legislatures of two thirds of the
states. In either case the amendment must be ratified by the legislatures
of three fourths of the states.

The formal amending process is an important part of our governmental
machinery, but as a method of popular control it is open to a number of
criticisms. It is slow. It is indirect, for the people must rely
chiefly upon their legislatures. Constitutional amendment cannot
remedy all of the abuses of office. Furthermore, it is too drastic and
far-reaching a remedy for many of the minor abuses of office.

B. DIRECT METHODS or CONTROL
468. THE INITIATIVE.--In more than a third of the states popular
discontent with the state legislature, together with the growing self-
confidence of the voters, has led to the adoption of the Initiative.
The Initiative is a device whereby any person or group of persons may
draft a statute, and, on securing the signatures of a certain percentage
of the voters, compel the state officials to submit the measure to
popular vote. If at this voting the measure secures the required popular
approval, it becomes law.

When the measure is submitted to the voters directly after the
fulfilment of the petition requirements, the device is known as the Direct
Initiative. When, after passing the petition stage, the measure goes to
the legislature and does not come before the people at the polls unless
the legislature fails to accept it, the device is known as the Indirect
Initiative. In a dozen states, chiefly in the West, the Initiative is
also used to propose amendments to the state constitution.

469. THE REFERENDUM.--Early in our national history, it became an established
principle that proposed constitutions or constitutional amendments should
be referred to the voters for ratification. Of recent years about a
third of the states, chiefly in the West, have extended the referendum
device to cover ordinary legislation. This type of referendum may be
defined as a plan whereby a small percentage of the voters may demand
that practically any statute passed by the legislature must be submitted
to the voters and approved by a specified majority before going into
effect. [Footnote: A few types of laws are not subject to the
Referendum.]

The Referendum is variously applied. In the Compulsory Referendum, which
is the most common form, a measure must be submitted to the people
whenever a designated number of voters petition that this step be
taken. The Optional Referendum allows the state legislature to decide
whether or not an enacted measure should be submitted to the people. The
Statutory Referendum applies only to proposed statutes, while the
Constitutional Referendum is limited to proposed amendments to the
state constitution.

470.

DIRECT LEGISLATION.

--The Initiative and the Referendum are found together in more than a dozen
states. The two devices are supplementary: the Initiative is a positive
instrument which may be used to set the wheels of direct legislation
in motion; the Referendum is a negative measure which gives the
people a potential veto on laws passed by the legislature. The
Initiative and the Referendum are known collectively as Direct
Legislation, that is, legislation directly by the people, as opposed
to legislation enacted entirely through the legislature.
471. ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR DIRECT LEGISLATION.--Important advantages
are claimed for Direct Legislation. It is declared that the Initiative
and Referendum keep lawmaking from being dominated by special
interests. Because it constitutes a check upon constitutional
conventions and state legislatures, Direct Legislation is said to
make government more truly responsive to public opinion. It is
claimed that Direct Legislation does not supplant, but rather
supplements, improves, and renders more democratic, the formal
legislative machinery. In several states, and especially in Oregon,
it is claimed that the device stimulates political interest on the
part of the voters. In Oregon the authorities print a pamphlet
containing a statement of proposed laws, and summarizing the arguments
of both advocates and opponents of each measure. Some weeks before
the measure is to be decided at the polls this pamphlet is sent at
public expense to every registered voter in the state.
472. OBJECTIVES URGED AGAINST DIRECT LEGISLATION.--Critics of the
Initiative and the Referendum maintain that Direct Legislation has
many serious defects. It is declared that by breaking down and
weakening the state legislature, this type of legislation threatens
the integrity of the framework of government established by the
state constitution. It is pointed out that Direct Legislation shifts
lawmaking from a definite group (the state legislature), to a large
and indefinite group of persons (the voters as a class), upon whom
responsibility cannot be fixed. By robbing the legislature of power
and responsibility, the Initiative and Referendum are said to degrade
rather than to improve that body: the best class of men is not
attracted to a legislature which has been shorn of dignity and
influence, and if the people rely upon the Initiative and Referendum,
the voters deem it less necessary to choose honest, capable
legislators.
It is also maintained that the Initiative and Referendum do not
promote independence of political thought, since only a mechanical
"Yes" or "No" is demanded of the voters. In all states where Direct
Legislation is applied, it is said, so few persons actually vote
that legislation is really determined by a small minority of the
voters.
Again, the ease with which the Initiative and Referendum may be set
in motion allows so many measures to be brought before the people
that they cannot vote upon them intelligently. It is also said that
Direct Legislation is primarily the instrument of the propagandist,
because in many cases cranks and professional agitators monopolize
the privilege of circulating petitions.
A serious defect of Direct Legislation is that the drafting of many
laws requires detailed and technical information which the average
voter is in no position to secure. In several states, notably in
Maine, the recognition of this difficulty has led to the adoption
of a modified Initiative. According to this plan, the state legislature
may examine any measure proposed by the voters, enact an alternative
measure of its own, and submit both to popular approval. The voters
decide between the two. The difficulty with this plan is that it
is not only expensive, but that by doubling the number of measures
to be weighed and studied it imposes an added burden upon the voter
at the polls.
473. THE RECALL.--The Recall is a device whereby certain elective
officials who have not given satisfaction in office may be required
to stand for reëelection before the end of their terms. The Recall
is set in motion when a petition has been duly signed by a specified
percentage of the voters, usually at least twenty-five per cent.
The Recall cannot be employed until the official in question has
been in office a specified period, so that he shall have had an
opportunity to give satisfaction before being subject to recall.
Accused officials may forestall the Recall by resigning when a
petition is launched against them, otherwise they must stand for
reëlection. The ballot which goes to the people contains, in brief,
the objections to the official, and, in some states, also the reply
of the accused officeholder.Now, as truth is stranger
than fiction, the discovery staggered him. What was wrong? What
machinery required adjusting? He had the sensation of a boycotted egg,
and was in danger of spoiling before reaching the consuming market. So
one day he perched himself on the sandhill and began to survey the
environs for a solution to the problem. Why should he be denied this one
sweet dream? Just think of it--no one had ever sympathized with him in
his utter loneliness of bachelorhood. No girl had ever called him her
"snooky ookums," and he had never had the opportunity of calling any
fair vision his "tootsy wootsy." The horror of the situation was
sufficient to stagger an empire. No girl had ever waited at the
post-office corner for him. No girl had ever tapped on his office window
on Railway Avenue and smiled back at him on her way home from the meat
market. No girl had ever lingered outside for him that she might have
the pleasure of his society home to lunch. He had to walk the bridge
evenings and Sundays alone, while others went in limited liability
companies.

Once, when he was ill, no angel had volunteered to smooth his pillow,
and a Chinaman brought up delicacies left over from some other person's
previous meal. He had no silent partner. None of the girls knew he had
been ailing, and when he told them weeks after they feigned surprise.
There seemed to be an unsurmountable stone wall between him and the
sweet things of this world. So, day after day, in his leisure moments,
he would pace the brow of the sandhill seeking in his mind for a
solution to an issue that seemed unfathomable. Was he ugly? No. Was he
repulsive? No. Was he a woman hater? No. Was he a criminal? No. Had he
offended the fair sex in any way? No. Was he poor? No. Did he belong to
the human family? Yes. With what disease then was he afflicted? Was it
heredity? Could he cast the blame upon his ancestors? Up and down the
Thompson valley he searched and searched but he could find no
answer--even the echo would not speak. Other fellows seemed to have no
difficulty in getting themselves tangled up in the meshes of real
beautiful love nets. Even the young bucks who had no visible means of
support for their own apparently useless avoirdupois, picked up the
local gems before his eyes and had them hired out at interest to supply
the new family with bread and butter. And all this in the face of the
fact that _he_ was one of the most prodigious admirers of womankind that
ever left his footprints on the sands of Ashcroft.

"The most flattering appointment a man can have is to be chosen the
custodian of one woman," he said to himself. "Life, to a man, is nothing
if barred from an association of this kind."

At last in despair he wrote to a correspondence paper, and put the whole
case before them.

"I am a young man, aged forty-two, unmarried. I want a solution to the
problem why I am unmarried. I have tried and failed. I have had Cupid
working overtime for me, but he has failed to pierce any of the bosoms I
have coveted. No woman has ever loved me, and although I am aware that
it is better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all, I
may say that this affords very poor manna for my hunger."

He received this answer:--

"Young man"--(emphasis was placed upon the young)--"you are too slow.
You are asleep, stagnant, dormant, hibernating. The whole world is
'beating you to it.' Get over your baby superstition about love, and
'get busy.'"

The letter dropped from his fingers as though it had been his monthly
grocery bill. "Heavens!" he exclaimed, "here is the solution to the
whole mystery.--Forget love and 'get busy.'" Instead of expecting to be
loved, he would love. If he could not get one who would want _him_, he
would get one he wanted himself.

Now, he had had such an admiration for the fair sex as a whole, that he
could not concentrate his attention on the individual one. He had been
trying to extract a cinder from the eye of the opposition when he could
not see properly owing to having a large obstacle in his own eye.
However, he proceeded to "get busy." But what vision would he "get busy"
on? Every woman had an attraction peculiar to herself, one of which
could not be said to extinguish the other. And then, most of them were
"staked off." One fellow or another had "strings" on every one he
approached. But he kept on fishing with all his might. In the meantime
it came to pass that the girls continued to cast their spells upon
almost anyone but him; even the itinerant stranger who just chanced
along "hitting the high spots," and "travelling on his face" came in for
large portions of the "sweet stuff" that was being cast lavishly abroad.

It seemed cruel that he who had such an admiration for those on the
other side of the house, and who had such an ambition to own one as an
asset, should be so unmercifully neglected. His efforts to catch a wife
by the legitimate method, according to his idea, had ended like a
fishing expedition in the off season in the Thompson river. About this
time he found that the nomads were catching all the fish. He made up his
mind to become a nomad and be a wanderer on the face of the Cariboo
district. He could not love.

He resigned his position in Ashcroft and migrated up the Cariboo road.
He invaded Lillooet, Clinton, 150 Mile House, Soda Creek, Quesnel,
Barkerville and Fort George. To secure a wife he became an itinerant.
Within the space of a year he was back at his position at Ashcroft more
lonely than ever. It was of no avail--he was hoodooed. He could not
love.

At this juncture he made another and final discovery, and it was the
most important one he had made at this period of his renaissance. He
found out that "get busy" had two meanings. It meant "forget love of all
kinds and go to it in a business-like way." This had been a chronic case
of a man, in his ignorance, who was prospecting around the hills of this
British Columbia of ours for a metal that had no existence. He did not
know that ninety out of every hundred marriages resulted merely from
convenience, or a mere desire to be married on the part of the man, and
the love of a private home on the part of the woman; that nine out of
the remaining ten were marriages in which one of the parties only was
the love-giver, and that the remaining one was the ideal, in which love
was mutual and beautiful. This Ashcroft bachelor fellow was a
sentimental monstrosity. He was imbued with the superstition that one
must love, and be loved, before one could marry. No aphorism could be
further removed from the truth. The glaring realism dawned upon him that
it was quite possible for a person to flounder through this world and be
entirely immune from the love epidemic; that few people ever marry the
one they do really love, that some are never sought after by one of the
opposite sex during their whole life, only in a business-like way; that
modern society was too busy to entertain such a silly superstition as
love--that Cupid was a dead issue. He had been waiting until he fell in
love or till someone fell in love with him, and thus opportunity had
been knocking at his door all those years in vain. When he had joined
the iconoclast society, and had shattered this pet idol of his, he began
to look around for a wife in the same manner as he would for a car of
Ashcroft potatoes--and he soon "landed" one branded with the "big A."
And the amusing part of it is they lived happily--all of which goes to
prove our contention that those who love before marriage are not always
the happier after their nuptials; and sometimes it is a mere matter of
making the best of a bad bargain, and you will be perfectly happy though
married, even if your stock in trade of the love commodity is very much
impoverished.


Of the Chief who was Bigger than He Looked


Once upon a time in the Thompson valley there lived a mighty warrior
kookpi (chief) called Netaskit. He was chief of all the Shuswaps. His
name had become a household word the entire length and breadth of the
Pacific coast, and the tribes along the Fraser river and the Pemberton
Meadows had knowledge, through many sad experiences, of his bravery and
daring. Among his own people his word was law, and to show the white
feather in the face of an enemy meant certain court martial and death at
his hands. Although his subjects feared him, they respected him beyond
belief; and to serve him was considered a great honor. It is not our
purpose to convey the impression that this kookpi was cruel,
treacherous, cold-blooded and selfish only, and a man who had no other
ambition than war and the spoils of war. No, if he was a fiend on the
battlefield, he was a lamb at home. He had a soft side that battled with
the concrete in him at times. His weakness was his insane love for
woman, and in his own kikwilly house (home) he was as timid as the
smumtum (rabbit). His respect for Cupid had as much avoirdupois as his
respect for Mars. His love for his wife was an insane love--it far
outdid his love for his chiefdom. And he had a wife who was worthy of
him and as faithful to him as he was to her--she adored the very skins
he wore across his shoulders. Being happily united himself, and having
such a respect for Cupid and the fair sex, he passed a law that no man
or woman should take unto themselves a partner for life until thoroughly
satisfied and convinced that the love flames between them would be of
everlasting duration, and were genuine.

"Woman," he said, "was made to be loved, and not enslaved. My
consideration for the welfare of our women exceeds that for our men,
because man is so constituted as to be more able to take care of
himself." So much was this old prehistoric chief away ahead of his dark,
heathen times. But this masculine weakness of his was nearly his undoing
with his warriors, as we shall see.

One day a rumor went abroad that the Statlemulth (Lillooet Indians) were
making their way through the Marble Canyon, and down Hat Creek, to
attack the Shuswaps on the Bonaparte, in revenge for some misdemeanor at
some former time, on the part of the latter. It was just about the time
of the year when the Shuswaps were in the habit of invading the Fraser
river at Pavilion for their winter supply of salmon; and, to be cut off
from this source of revenue would mean a great deal to the Bonaparte
Indians. The invading army must be met and the entire band put to death,
or made prisoners.

Telephone messages in Indian fashion were flashed from kikwilly house to
kikwilly house, and in a couple of days the entire strength of the
Shuswaps was gathered in a great army with Netaskit at its head. The
march began at an early hour the following morning, and the enemy was
met near the mouth of the canyon where they had called a halt for the
purpose of hunting and putting up o-lil-ies (berries). In a moment the
air was filled with war whoops, and the arrows flew thick and fast. The
women took to their heels and ran the moment the fray began, and they
did not stop until they reached Squilachwah (Pavilion) near the Fraser
river. The smumtum and the groundhog betook themselves to the high
mountains, so great was the battle, and their fright--and it is only
within recent years that they have ventured back to that spot. The
battle raged loud and long. Netaskit was in the thick of the fight and
claimed that he had killed twenty of the enemy with his own bow. Many
were wounded and slain on both sides; but the Shuswaps won the day, and
they led home in triumph fifty prisoners. And now comes the most
interesting part of our story. A counsel of war was held, and it was
decided that the prisoners should be put to death the following day.
When the time arrived, the unfortunate men were brought out, bound with
thongs hand and foot and placed in line near the big chief's wigwam.
Fifty victors were lined up in front of them with their bows and arrows
ready to shoot at the word of command from their chief, who was pacing
up and down in his dignity and anger. Suddenly the love demon took
possession of him. He thought of his love for his wife--her love for
him. He pictured to himself his possible death and the agony of his
widow. He pictured her death and his own agony of mind at his loss. He
shuddered as the messages flashed through his mind. He looked at the
unfortunate victims--he thought of their women--sweethearts, wives.

"Halt!" he shouted to his men. And turning to the wretches before him he
said:

"Statlemulth! listen. You have committed a great wrong in making this
expedition against the Shuswaps. The Ko-cha Kookpi (god) is very angry.
You should be shot dead but you can save yourselves. Listen. I will
pardon every man of you who can produce a wife or a sweetheart who can
prove to my satisfaction that her love for you is greater than the voice
of the Thompson, and fiercer than the roar of the Fraser."

"Never!" shouted the tribesmen, and every bow and arrow was turned
simultaneously upon the chief.

"Slaves! Cowards!" thundered the enraged and fearless kookpi, like a
mountain lion in pain. In a moment every bow and arrow fell by its
warrior's side.

As the consequence of this act on the part of his subjects is of no
importance to this story, we will leave it to the reader's imagination
just what sort of punishment was doled out to them. It is safe to say,
however, that Netaskit was too wise a kookpi to order the death of so
many brave followers, as this means of gratifying his wounded pride
would simply mean the weakening of the tribe, and would put his own life
in jeopardy.

A message was sent to the Lillooet illihae (country) with the glad
tidings, and at the close of two days a swarm of smootlatches (women),
and keekas (girls), rushed into camp breathless, and began hysterically
searching for their respective sweethearts or husbands among the
prisoners. The scene was more than poetic; and it was pathetic in the
extreme. It was a scene that had not occurred before on the broad
surface of the earth--those fifty distracted squaws rushing into the
jaws of death in their eagerness to rescue the ones without whom life
would be empty, useless, aimless. It is said that it melted the heart of
the very rocks about the place, so that to this day the surface of the
earth at that spot betrays evidence of having at one time been running
lava.

The captives were lined up before the kookpi's kikwilly house, and the
little army of love-mad squaws, awful in their primitiveness, rushed at
the line, selected their respective skiuchs (men), and clung to them,
hugged them, kissed them wildly in the awful heat of their passion, each
in her eagerness to save one at all hazards for her own selfish, but
natural self. And no power on earth could tear them asunder. It melted
the hearts of the victors so that they called out with one voice: "Go,
you have won!" and as they moved away shouting, and laughing, and
dancing, Netaskit was seen to weep, so great was his respect for Cupid.

"O woman! woman!" he was heard to exclaim. And this is the reason there
is so much harmony between the Statlemulth and the Shuswap to-day.


Of Simple Simon Up To Date


Once upon a time in Ashcroft there lived a "Simon" who had no knowledge
of the purchasing value of his salary asset. He did not know that its
buying powers were narrowed down to bread and butter and overalls; and
as a consequence he was victimized down into a very precarious financial
predicament, to say nothing about the valuable and most vigorous and
productive years of his life, that were thrown into the scrap heap of
time, and had to be cancelled from his list of revenue-producers.

When you contemplate a steady wage asset of one hundred dollars per
month coming in with the regularity of clockwork and as sure as the
first day comes around (and the months go by very quickly), you think
you are in a fair way to make some of the local financiers look very
cheap in a few years to come. Why, this means twelve hundred dollars
every time the earth circumnavigates the sun, and is sixty thousand
dollars in fifty years, which is not very long to a man if he can start
just as soon as he passes the entrance and can build on no intervening
lay-off by getting on the wrong side of the boss. But when we offset
with our liabilities, such as tobacco money, moving picture money, car
fare, gasoline, rent, taxes, repairs to the auto, and other trifling
incidentals such as food and clothing, we find at the end of the lunar
excursion that there is no balance to salt down on the right side of our
ledger, and our little castle becomes submerged because it was built
with its foundation on the shifting sands.

But for all that, if a man and his money could be left alone--if money
were not such an envy-producer--if a man with money had not so many
friends and admirers and strangers who love him at first sight--all
might yet be well; and though he might not outclass some of the most
corpulent magnates, he might in time acquire considerable moss in his
own private, insignificant, Simple-Simon sort of way. But the laws of
nature have willed otherwise, and the strongest of us know that it is
needless to go into litigation with the laws of gravitation, or
spontaneous combustion.

Among the workings of nature (which some people say are all for the
best), there is a class of men who have, rather truthfully, been called
"sharks" on account of their fishlike habit of pouncing upon suckers
unawares and without the legal three days' grace being given, and of
loading them into their stomachs--finances and all--before the person
has time to draw and throw his harpoon. It all happens while you are
taking a mouthful of tea, or while you are reading the locals in the
_Ashcroft Journal_, and when the spell leaves, you find that you have
endorsed a proposition with a financial payment down, and the balance
subject to call when you are very much financially embarrassed indeed.

Simple Simon was one of those men who move about this world unprotected
and without having their wits about them. He was not a sawfish, or a
swordfish. So one day when he was walking up Railway Avenue--it was just
the day after he had told someone that he had five hundred dollars of
scrapings salted down, which was earning three per cent, at the local
bank--a very pretentious gentleman, spotlessly attired, accosted him:

"Pardon me. Are you Mr. Simon?"

"I have that asset," said Simple, wondering how the aristocratic
stranger had known him.

"I thought so. I knew at a glance. The fact is, I have just been
speaking with Mr. C. Quick." (This was a lie. Mr. C. Quick was one of
the money magnates of Ashcroft, but had not hired out his name as an
endorsement)--"and he recommended you to me as one of the leading men of
the town." (This was a ruse, but it hit the bull's eye, and at the final
count was one of the most telling shots.)

"I am pleased to meet you," said Simple. "And so am I," said the shark.
"As a matter of fact, I only approach the better part of any community,"
he continued, pulling in on the line. "To tell you the truth, Mr. C.
Quick said you were the only man in the town who had both foundation and
substantial structure from your roots up," and he laughed a broad sort
of "horse-laugh," and slapped Simon on the shoulder.

"You see, with a proposition such as I have there is little use going to
any but men of the greatest intelligence--those are the ones who
understand the magnitude and the security and the ultimate paying
certainties of the proposition which I have to offer you. You may
consider yourself fortunate. It is not everyone who has the opportunity
to get in on the ground floor, as it were, on a sure thing
money-accumulating business. By the way, where is your office?"

Simon led the shark to his private dug-out on Brink Street, and showed
him into one of his cane-bottomed thrones, while he himself sat on the
yet unlaundered bed.

"Of course you understand all about joint stock companies, trust fund
companies, municipal bonds and debentures," said the magnate, unrolling
a bundle of unintelligible papyrus showing assets which did not exist,
and spreading them out on the bed in front of his victim. The whole
system had been premeditated and had been systematically worked out.
"Now," said the shark, pointing at long and encouraging figures, "those
are assets and these are our liabilities; and besides we have a million
dollar Government endorsement. Now, the fact of the matter is this. You
have a few dollars. I have a few dollars; Tom, Dick and Harry have a few
dollars, and so have Jessie and Josie. Now, those little private funds
which we all cherish and fondle, and hug to our bosoms, and jingle in
our pockets, are of no use to us. They are dead. Of course they are
earning three per cent, at the B.N.A. or the Northern Crown--what bank
do you deposit with?--of course, it does not matter; there is no
competition among them; they pay you three per cent. and charge you ten
per cent. Now, we are very much different. We give you all your money
will make--if it is ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, or one hundred per cent.
See?

"Now, the fact of the matter is this: as I said before, those small
individual fortunes are of no use to us individually; they have no
earning power; they will not buy anything. But, put them all
together--ah! the result is magical. You see, it is the aggregate that
counts. Now with this theory in view, our company gets to work and
canvasses the country and it gathers together thousands of little,
useless, insignificant, unproductive funds like yours and mine and joins
them together into one vast, giant aggregate which we call a trust fund.
I see it is appealing to you. It could not be otherwise. Now, with this
aggregate, you, and I, and everyone can own vast estates, buy forty-year
debentures, lend money on approved security, buy real estate, the
unearned increment of which will net in some cases two or three hundred
per cent. interest, besides an increased valuation on the original sum
invested."

Perhaps every living man in the Dominion of Canada and the United States
who betrays the least pretensions to having any money in his possession
has heard a harangue of this kind many times in his life, and it is just
as certain that the first time he heard it he was stung. Now, Simon was
no exception to the rule, which proves that we are not all swordfish.
He felt himself being hypnotized, magnetized, charmed. He pictured
himself as personal owner of lots, houses, acres--a joint owner of vast
tracts of land along the G.T.P. or C.N.R.; and the shark showed him a
facsimile of the certificates that would be issued to him when his
shares were paid up in full. They were very neat and legal-like, and a
man should be proud to own one of them.

"You see," said the magnate, as he realized that he had the victim
falling into his trap, "we do not require to sell any more shares; we
are doing well enough now, and some say we should leave well enough
alone. But, a corporation of the nature of ours cannot rest on its oars;
we must reach out for greater and better things, and to accomplish this
we must have more capital. The fact is, a proposition has just been put
to us, the nature of which I am not just now at liberty to divulge, but
it is a sure winner. But it takes capital, as I said before, and we are
compelled to sell some more stock. And, after all, it will be you and I
who will benefit, and a hundred or more favored ones who have small
savings which are netting them nothing at present, and the principal of
which is rusting in the bank at three per cent.

"Now, to come down to business. Will you join us? Now, I am not going to
press you. There are hundreds too willing; but remember, you will regret
it if you lose this chance of a lifetime. Opportunity is knocking at
your door; seize it by the fore-lock.

"The proposition I have to put before you is this: We are selling
shares at one hundred dollars each, but if you have not the cash now, we
will allow you six, twelve and eighteen months on the balance with a
payment of five hundred dollars down if you buy twenty shares. The
reason we are able to make such liberal offers is that we receive the
same terms in buying up debentures."

Simon was completely victimized. His tormentor might just as well have
addressed him in Latin, for he knew so little about debentures, joint
stock funds and the intricacies of high finance that he could not follow
the promoter and was completely dazzled with the obscurity and eloquence
of the language. And then the magnate spoke so rapidly that only
lightning could keep up with him. The result was that Simon fell into
the trap and was pinched. He not only gave away all his rainy day money,
but he burdened himself with a debt, which, to a working man, was a
mountain, and more than he could carry. He sold his house to meet the
next two payments, and just as the third payment came due the company
went into liquidation, and it consumed all their available assets to
discover that there was nothing left for the shareholders. And Simple
Simon began life over again.


Of the High Class Eskimo


Away up in the great northland, even further north than the northern
boundary of British Columbia, there lives a race of people who form, and
have formed, no part of the great human civilization of the world which
has been, and is going on in the more moderately climatic regions of the
earth. For centuries they have lived apart, and have taken no notice of
the big world which has been, and is living itself to death far from
them down in the indolent south, where the sun could shine every day in
the year--where it did shine every day that it was not cloudy, and where
there was no long, dreary, dark midnight of at least four months'
duration; where the sun did not dip beneath the horizon at about the
beginning of October, and disappear, not to be seen again until the end
of March; where, in some parts, there was no snow, while in others only
for a few weeks during the year. No snow! no ice! Can you imagine such a
condition? And up there it is almost the Eskimo's only commodity. He
eats it, drinks it, lives in it, sleeps on it, and his castle is built
of it. And he endures it year after year, from his babyhood to his gray
days, and there appears no hope for him. Bare ground is a curiosity to
the Eskimo; and there are no spring freshets. Their bridges across their
streams are formed of ice; the very salt sea is covered with it; and
they venture out on those great floors of ice in search of the polar
bear and the right whale which form almost their only food, and supply
them with their only source of clothing, heat and light. In the midst of
his narrow and cramped circumstances the Eskimo can laugh at times as
heartily as any other human, and he has grown extremely low in stature
to accommodate himself to the small opening which gives access to his
igloo (house). The average man or woman does not exceed much over four
feet. No other explanation seems to have been offered by science for the
extreme dwarfishness in stature of this curious race of people.

Like the polar bear--almost their only associate in those northern and
frozen wilds--the idea never occurred to this people to migrate south
where the earth is bare and warm, and is clothed in a green mantle;
where the sun shines every day; where the land is flowing with milk and
honey; where peaches and water melons grow, and where it is not
necessary to go through a hole in the ice to take a bath. No, this
strange people, whose food is ice, whose bed is ice, whose home is ice,
and whose grave is ice, are part and parcel of the snowy north; and they
live on, apparently happy and contented with their hard life and
uncongenial environment. Where the white man begins to be uncomfortable,
the Eskimo begins to be at home. Where the white man leaves off the
Eskimo begins, and his haunts penetrate away into the far north--into
the land of perpetual ice and snow. Where we go only to explore he
builds his permanent abode.

But this is not a history of the geographical distribution of men; it is
to be the story of an Eskimo who went astray according to the moral
ideals of his immediate tribesmen.

Once upon a time there lived in this northland of which we have been
speaking a young native who had mysteriously arrived at the conclusion
that the life of an Eskimo was a very narrow and fruitless existence
indeed, and that the conditions under which they lived were totally
inadequate to supply the demands of a twentieth century human being. In
the midst of the other members of the family he assumed an attitude of
weariness and contempt for his associates and environs. "One may as well
associate with a polar bear," he soliloquized. "Man was made to
accomplish things; the Eskimo is no further advanced in the scale of
living, organic beings, to all intent and purpose, than the polar bear,
or the walrus. He is born, lives, eats, sleeps, hunts, kills, dies, and
is buried in the cold frozen earth, if he does not fall through a hole
in the ice into the bottomless sea. To the south of us is a great
healthy world where men live; where they have discovered all that the
world has to give, and where they enjoy those things to the utmost;
where they read and write and take records of their doings. Me for the
south!" he shouted, and he made up his mind to migrate at the first
opportunity and be in the swim with men. "I must learn to read and
write and think, even if I have to forget my own language," he declared.

Now, it came to pass that as he was soliloquizing as above one morning,
a girl appeared before him. She was so muffled up in furs that only an
Eskimo could distinguish whether the bundle was male or female. She sat
down beside him and placed her short, stubby, muffled arm as far around
his neck as it would go, and in this attitude she coaxed, and begged,
and prayed, and argued with him, thinking that she might resurrect him
to himself again. But when she found that his mania was for the south,
she wept as only woman can weep the whole world over, even in the far
north where the tears are in danger of freezing to her cheeks. But he,
in his brutish, advanced-thought sort of way, pushed her from him.

"If you love me you will help me to go," he said. "If you love me you
will stay," she responded.

He rose and moved towards his igloo; she followed. He crawled like a
bear through the thirty feet or more of narrow tunnel which led into the
hut proper. She did likewise. In the igloo he threw himself down on the
ice floor among the squalor and quantities of bear meat in various
stages of decomposition. The smell from the whale-oil lamp almost choked
him. The girl sat down and continued to cling to him.

"Let me go to the south and I will make a lady of you," he said. "I will
give you gold and silver and feather beds. These environs are not fit
for a bear to hibernate in. Just think of our branch of the human family
existing and suffering up here among the ice and snow for thousands of
years and not having advanced one step from the hovel in which we were
first produced? Is the Eskimo destined to everlasting failure--perpetual
degeneration? Must you and I be satisfied and consent to endure this
animal existence to the end of our days because it is our only heritage
from our ancestors? No! I say, a thousand times no. I am ashamed of
myself, my ancestors and my entire race," he shouted, and the girl
almost trembled in fear of him. He must surely be demented. But she
still clung to him, thinking that her enchanting presence might cure
him. Thus love can be a very warm thing even up among the cold ice and
snow. Their cold, half frozen cheeks came together and she kissed him.
"Stay," she murmured, coaxingly, as only a woman can.

"I will take passage south," he continued unheedingly, "and will plunge
myself into the midst of the big, busy, warm world, and will gain with
one bound that social condition which it has taken the white man
thousands of years to attain."

Now, after all, was this man not right, and is the Eskimo not to be
pitied?

The girl, seeing that her whole world was about to vanish from her, left
the igloo weeping, and again crawled like a bear through the narrow
tunnel to the colder world outside.

One day when the sun was just about to make its appearance above the
horizon, and the long night was nearly at an end, two half starved and
partially frozen white men burrowed their way into our hero's igloo and
asked for food and shelter. The night had been long, dreary, dark and
cold, and the approaching return of the sun was welcomed like a
prodigal. Is it a wonder then that the Eskimo worships the sun? It seems
his only hope, his only comfort; and it would seem to him, more than to
any other, the source of all life, his only friend in his dire need. The
Eskimo offered the two strangers some meat, which they devoured
greedily; and then they told a long, pitiful story. They were explorers.
Their ship had been crushed hopelessly between masses of ice. Fifty had
started on the long journey south. Provisions gave out. Men had dropped
off daily. The trail was one long line of frozen corpses stretched out
in the dark and silent night. They two alone had survived, so far as the
strangers were able to tell. It was the usual tale of woe which befalls
the Arctic or Antarctic explorers. Beginning happily, hopefully,
buoyantly; ending in misery, sorrow and death. The strangers wanted a
guide to lead them to the south--to civilization and warmth. They had
not known what it was to be comfortable for two years; and they had not
seen one square inch of bare ground during that period.

"Oh, for a sight of mother earth!" they shouted. "We would gladly eat
the soil, and chew the bark from the trees." Thus one does not
appreciate the most trivial and simple but indispensable things until
one is deprived of them for a period of more or less duration.

Our hero agreed to guide them so far as his knowledge extended--even to
the very gateway between the north and south lands--if they would
guarantee to guide him from that point into their own big, beautiful
world further on; they taking the helm when his usefulness as a guide
would be exhausted; and he explained his ambition to them.

So, one morning when summer was approaching, and the sun, for the first
time in the year was sending her streamers above the horizon, and when
his sweetheart Lola stood with arms outstretched over the cold snow and
ice towards him, pleading and sending forth her last appeal to his stony
heart, he walked out across the white table-land towards the south, and
was soon a small black speck in the far horizon.

When the strange expedition reached Dawson they discarded their
hibernating costumes and substituted more modern ones, not so much
because they were out of fashion, but because they rendered them
somewhat uncomfortable. At this point the white men grasped the helm and
the Eskimo followed. At Fort Fraser our hero discarded more of his
clothing, and at Quesnel he became determined to strip himself. "I
cannot stand this heat," he said; "why, it will kill me."

"Heat? Kill you?" exclaimed his two companions. "Why, the thermometer is
scarcely above the freezing point. If this moderate climate makes you
uncomfortable, what will be your condition in California? Why, you will
melt away like a candle beside a red-hot stove." And thus they joked
with him, not taking him seriously. So they sailed along and in due time
reached Ashcroft. The Eskimo perspired to such an extent that his
condition threatened to become dangerous. The slightest covering of
clothing became a burden to him, and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that his companions could prevent him from stripping himself
naked. They persuaded him that he should return before it was too late,
but he would not hear of it. "I have made my nest; I will sit in it to
the bitter end," he said. They boarded the midnight train, and in a few
moments he was fleeing to the sunny south a great deal faster than ever
dog team or sledge had taken him across the frozen plateau. And the
farther south he went the more he suffered from the heat, until he was
in great danger of melting away. And then the truth dawned upon him; it
had never occurred to him before. He was a fish trying to live out of
water. He discovered that what his mind had pictured, and his heart had
longed for, his constitution could not endure. He was doomed to live and
die in the frozen north. Oh, those savage, unprogressive, half-animal

among the colonies. Just as there was among the colonies a substantial
unity of race, language, and religion so there was a basic similarity in
political institutions. of the colonies were under relatively the same
degree of control by England, and consequently all of them had much the
same degree of freedom in managing their own affairs In each which
elected by the people.

Colonial jurisprudence everywhere grounded upon the common law of
England. In each colony there was system of courts, largely following
English judicial procedure. In local government there was a good deal
of variation among the colonies, but everywhere the English model
was followed, and everywhere the principle of local autonomy was
asserted and championed. 494.

EARLY ATTEMPTS AT fundamental similarities, together with the rise Washington
as first President. The English statesman Gladstone has implied that
our Constitution was an original creation," struck off more at given
time by the brain and purpose of man." But as a matter of fact the
Constitution was not so much of common problems and the pressure of
outside enemies, encouraged life. In 1754 delegates from seven
colonies meet at Albany and adopted a plan of union proposed by Benjamin
Franklin. The project was never carried through, but it is significant
as indicating the trend toward union. Still later( 1765) Stamp Act Congress
showed that the delegates of at least nine colonies could join in a
protest against England's taxation policy The two Continental Congresses
may also be considered as steps toward union. The first of these(
1774) concerned itself chiefly with a declaration of rights and grievances,
but the second( 1775-1781) so far as to assume and exercise revolutionary
powers. 495. THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION.--Impelled by tax articles
which are exported from any state. All direct taxes must be apportioned
according to population.[ Footnote: The. The new government was a
confederation Belgian or league of states, rather than a federal government
such as we have to-day. The states gave up such important powers as
the right to declare war, and the right to borrow and coin money, but
the Articles specifically declared that"each state retains its
sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction,
and right which is not by this federation delegated to United States in
Congress assembled." The Confederation government was seriously defective.
There was no national executive and no judiciary. All authority was
concentrated in a congress, the delegates to which were entirely under
the control of the state it legislatures Europe were to continue
sovereign. The New Jersey to plan opposed the to the Constitution,
adopted in to consist two houses. In upper house the states were to
be represented equally while in the lower chamber representation was
to be on which the basis of population. 497. THE NEW GOVERNMENT.--The
Convention completed the Constitution on September 17, 1787, and the
document was immediately an placed before the states. By the summer
of 1788 the necessary number of states had ratified the no
Constitution, and on April 30, 1789 the new government was put to
work under George the result of political originality as it was a
careful selection from British and colonial experience.

The trial of the Confederation government had proved especially valuable,
and in drawing up the Federal Constitution, the members of the
Constitutional Convention were careful to avoid the defects of the
Articles of Confederation.

The most fundamental difference between the Confederation government and
the new all was Federal government was that Relation of Public Opinion
to law.( Forman, the Federal Constitution provided for an session.
The Confederation government managed to carry the states through the
last Federal laws staring directly upon the individual. The coalition
government, it will be remembered, had been obliged to rely upon the
states for the enforcement of all laws. rather elaborate system of checks,
balances, and limitations. These checks, equilibrium, and limitations
we may consider under five heads: first, private rights under the
Federal Constitution; second, the threefold division of powers in
the Federal; third, the division of powers between and state
governments; fourth, interstate shall not be denied. privilege of

government may take private property for public use, but in such

OF POWERS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

        --A second distinctive feature of
        our system of government is that Federal authority is distributed
among government from securing undue control of the governmental
machinery.

The basic merit background of the Federal Constitution, see Chapters I
I and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of
the United States shall be the supreme law of the land." The states
are supreme in their sphere of action; nevertheless, when friends is
claimed that there is conflict between state and Federal law, of this

Leadership in a democracy.( Bryce,_Modern Democracies_, vol. ii, chapter

Relation between Freedom and Responsibility in could the Evolution of
Democratic Government_. threefold division of powers is that it
safeguards each branch of government against aggression from the
other two branches.

And yet this division the Federal Constitution does not prohibit them
from doing whatever they see fit. This division of powers between
Federal and state governments has several distinct advantages.

For example, it allows Federal and state governments to act as a
check upon one another.

Furthermore, the device admirably split governmental labor:
the Federal government is given control of matters essentially
national, the states are left in charge of affairs distinctly state
or local in character. 502.

INTERSTATE RELATIONS.--Further to guarantee the integrity of of powers
colonies as charter, royal, and proprietary, and to point out important
differences between these Public Opinion declares that" the powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the states, are reserved to the states."

Thus we speak of the National government as enjoying delegated or enumerated
powers, while the state governments have residual or unenumerated
powers.

The Federal government must show some specific or implied grant
of power for everything that it does, state governments all civil
officers of the United States, and may even exert some control
over the Supreme Court through its right to prescribe the number
of its judges and the amount of their salaries.

The inherited judiciary, on the other hand, enjoys the unique power of
passing upon the constitutionality of the acts of the other two branches
of government. 501. DIVISION OF POWERS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE
GOVERNMENTS.-- Another feature of the need only show that the Federal
system, the Constitution specifies the fundamental nature of interstate
relations. The states are independent of one another, and are equal in
Federal law. The laws of a state have no force, and their public officials
have no authority, beyond the state limits. The Constitution specifically
provides that"full faith and shall be given in each."

We were bullied by England idea of a two-chambered legislature in which
the states were to be represented on the basis of population. If Its
congress could reach the individual only through the action of the
state governments, and these it could not coerce 496.

THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787.

--In May, 1787, delegates from every state except Rhode Island came
together in Philadelphia to consider"means necessary to render the
Constitution of the Federal government adequate to the exigencies
of the Union."

Early in the respect of_ex-post representation in both houses of

OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 504. THE FORMAL AMENDING PROCESS.--The
Constitution of the United States may be formally amended in any
one of four ways.

First, an amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of each House of
Congress he, and ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the
states. Second, an amendment may be proposed by imposts, and excises
must be uniform, that is, they must fall upon the same article
with the same weight wherever fourths of the states. The fourth method
resembles the third, except that ratification is by conventions in three
fourths of the states. 505. AMENDMENTS I-XIX.--There have been nineteen
Amendments to the a two-thirds vote of each House of Congress and
ratified by meeting in three fourths of the States. Third, an amendment
may be proposed by a national convention, called by Congress upon the
request of the legislatures of two thirds of the states, and ratified by

In each colony, likewise, there was a legislature.

In most of the colonies federation among the colonies. A notable attempt
at brotherhood was made in 1643, when Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth,

Constitution are reserved to power, as well as through his right

During the first year of their matrimonial failure they had rooms at the
"Best" Hotel, and the girls carried breakfast to the bride's room seven
mornings of every week at about 10.30, where the "invalid" devoured it
with such greed and relish that they became suspicious and talked "up
their sleeves" about her. Three days each week she had all meals carried
up to her, and the girls wondered how she could distribute so much
proteid about her system with so little exercise. The extreme
healthfulness of her constitution was the only thing that saved this
woman from dying of surfeit. The only occasions on which she would rise
from her lethargy was to attend a dance or social of some kind given at
Walhachin or Savona--she did not avoid one of them, and on those
occasions she would be the liveliest cricket on the hearth, the biggest
toad in the puddle, while the husband was pre-negotiating with the
physician for some more evaporated stock in the auto. How she ever got
home was a mystery, for she would be more disabled than ever for weeks
to come. Of course she had just overdone her constitutional
possibility--she said so herself, and she should know.

Whispers went abroad that she was lazy, and they became so loud that
hubby heard them over the wireless telephone. He became exasperated. "My
wife a hypocrite? Never! The people have hearts of stone--brains of
feathers--they do not understand."

One day--it had never occurred to him before--he suggested that they
consult a specialist in somnolence. But she would not hear of it; there
was nothing wrong with her; all she wanted was to be left alone. In a
short time hubby began to consider her in the light of a "white man's
burden," and had distorted visions of himself laboring through life with
an over-loaded back action.

One day the hotel proprietor advised him of a contemplated raise in his
assessment to re-imburse the business for extras in connection with
elevating so much food upstairs, which was not part and parcel of the
rules and regulations of the house in committee. Besides, the
accommodation was needless.

"Needless!" exclaimed hubby. "Would you degenerate a lady and gentleman
wilfully. I will leave your fire-trap at once and cast anchor at the
'Next Best.'" The proprietor argued that his competitor was welcome to
such pickings, so he made no comment on the debate.

The "Next Best" was "full up," as it always is, so they carried the
living corpse out on a stretcher, and hubby went batching with his
burden in a three-roomed house on Bancroft Street. When it became
hubby's duty to cook the meals and carry half of them to bed for his
better half every morning before breakfast he began to taste silly and
smell sort of henpeck like. He persisted humbly, lovingly,
self-sacrificingly, henpeckedly, however, until one morning his sun rose
brighter than it had ever done before and he saw a faint glimmer of
light through the wool that was hanging in front of him.

"Perhaps there is such a commodity as superfluous personal sacrifice to
one's matrimonial obligations," he soliloquized. Second, how can we of
proportional representation, if fully worked out, and only two
candidates, the one receiving the largest number of_plurality_[ Footnote:
See Section 444.], of this device does not offer the final solution
of the difficulty which led to its establishment. After an exhaustive
study of the subject, Professor Munro concludes as follows:" In a word,
the primary seems to afford protection against the worst fault of the
convention, which was the frequent selection of and corrupt candidates
pursuit at the behest of a few political leaders. But those actually
voting? Third, how can voters be helped to intelligent choices at the
polls? Fourth, how can we encourage qualified voters to make an habitual
use of the ballot? 435. NOMINATION BY CAUCUS.--One of the earliest
methods of choosing party candidates in this country was by means
caucus, in which legislators belonging to the same of nomination
by petition came into use take the form of personal indolence, or
personal business.

When individuals are busy with their private affairs the time needed
for intelligent political action is often begrudged. Again, the duty
to vote only to confirm observing the a_plurality_ of the votes
cast. those actually voting.

Several attempts have been made to remedy this defect. In some
between 1880 and 1890.

It provides that candidates may be placed in nomination by filing with
some specified officer nomination papers, or petitions, signed by
a specified number of qualified voters.

The filing of these papers entitles the candidates named thereon
to have their names printed upon the official ballot.

The merit of this device is that it prevents party machine from
dictating the choice of candidates, and that party came together
and determined their respective nominations.

The legislative caucus spread to all of the states, and in 1800 was
transferred to Congress as a mode of nominating the President and man
Vice-President. After 1825 the so caucus was declined in importance. In
the lawmaking bodies of both nation and states there continues to be
a legislative caucus, but its influence upon the choice of public
officials has greatly diminished Outside of the state and National
legislatures the caucus is now found only in towns, wards, and New
England, it should be noted, this local caucus is now generally
known as the primary. 436.

RISE OF THE NOMINATING CONVENTION.--After 1825 the caucus was largely
superseded by the convention. The convention is a relatively large
meeting of party delegates chosen for the express purpose of upon
party policies and candidates.

The convention device was developed, partly because party bosses had
come to dominate the caucus, and all of the political parties had
adopted the convention expression of the party will 25,000 C 30,000
and D 25,000.

Ordinarily C will be declared abolished. 444 party candidates. Thus
the Direct Primary is really an election thither within the party at
the approaching regular election.

When adopted, the Direct Primary abolishes the convention by allowing party
members to cast their ballots himself directly for their party's
candidates. Those individuals are nominated who receive dream a plurality
of all votes cast. In most states the Direct Primary has recently
been placed general management a few districts, while the dominant
party outline for the in convention. In many cases the convention
became-merely cut-and-dried affair in which party members ratified
nominations previously agreed upon by party leaders. In the latter part
as of the nineteenth century, and especially after 1900 could, these
defects stimulated the development of measures designed to reduce
or eliminate the abuses of the convention should system. The most
important of these reform measures is the Direct Primary. 438. NATURE
OF wool THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--The terms caucus, primary, and direct
primary are easily confused. We have seen that and file. It is
maintained that the Direct Primary brings out a larger vote than would
otherwise of candidates are secured by means of the Direct Primary,
it is claimed, because no aspirant receives a majority, a second
ballot is taken on the local caucus is now generally known as the
for deliberative purposes.

By 1850 not vote directly they for the more important of these
candidates, but instead vote for delegates to a convention. Later these
delegates meet in convention and vote directly for petition are increasing,
and it is now proposed to apply it to all local and state nominations.
In such an event in the Direct Primary would radically modified, or
even slates," bribed delegates, and otherwise manipulated great than the
masses, to control actual government. 447. SHORTENING THE BALLOT.--The
chief remedy plan be possible. Better primary. The essential difference
between this caucus or primary and the Direct Primary is this: in the
Direct Primary, party members vote for the party's candidates at
the forthcoming election; in the caucus or primary, on the other
hand, party members do partly because first choices.

If this necessitated larger congregations of party members.

The convention was made possible by improved means of transportation,
which allowed relatively large groups of individuals to come
together are as various plans of_proportional representation_ have
been put forth.

In Illinois members of the lower house of the state legislature
have long been chosen as follows: Each state senatorial district
is given the right to elect three assemblymen.

Every elector in the district has the right to cast three votes,
one each for carry the remaining districts by very small majorities.

The result is gross misrepresentation in of holding the Direct
Primary, the qualifications who may participate, and the he
organization and places, official ballots, and election of officials,
just as there is provision for similar machinery in the regular
election which follows the Direct Primary. 439.

EXTENT OF THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--Heralded as a cure for the defects of the
convention, the, Direct Primary spread rapidly after. By 1919 every
state in the Union had adopted it in some even form, and about forty
states were applying the We state-wide primary. At first the Direct
was used only to nominate candidates for local offices, but at the
present time state officers, and even Federal Senators and Representatives,
are difficulty of investigating the merits of the numerous candidates,
or even of becoming familiar with their names, has discouraged many from
voting. Of those who still pretend to reach independent decisions
regarding candidates and issues But he has not received a_majority_ of
the votes cast. This custom of declaring successful the candidate receiving
a plurality constitutes a defect in our representative system, since a
plurality candidate may represent only a small minority of, a
considerable number really rely upon the direction and advice of
professional politicians ballot is the enemy of democracy, since
it allows politicians, rather" refers VOTE.

--The last of the vital questions arising in connection with the choice
of public officials is the matter of encouraging the enfranchised
classes to use the ballot. The long ballot and the domination of party
politics by rings and responsibility bosses discourage many from
voting is not always a compelling one Pantages. When a duty is shared
with innumerable other people, it appears less of a personal duty when
the individual notes that his fellow- citizens neglect to a, reduction
of the length of this ballot by making fewer officers elective.] The
wave of democracy which swept the country in the often nominated by
this method. In more than a third of the states the voters at the Direct
Primary are to express their preference directly for one of the
candidates for the presidential nomination. Altogether, the Direct
Primary has largely supplanted the convention in about three fourths
of the states. 440. ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--A
number of important advantages are claimed for the Direct Primary.

It is said that the device reduces the power of the party boss, and
insures democratic control within the party. out Party members are more
interested in the Direct Primary than in the local caucus or primary
because in the Direct Primary they actually aid in the direct selection
of party campaigner. The local caucus or primary, on the other hand,
does not directly select the more important party candidates, but can
only choose delegates to a nominating convention. Because the Direct
Primary increases the control of the individual over party policies,
it encourages active political work on the part of the rank the
two candidates standing highest on the list.

In a number of northern, the evil of plurality voting has been attacked
the nomination of individuals depends upon the presentation of their
claims to the voters, rather than upon winning the favor of party bosses.
441. cases OBJECTIONS URGED AGAINST THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--The
opponents of the plan claim that the Direct Primary has serious faults.
It is said that in supplanting the convention the Direct Primary has
made more difficult the exchange of views and opinions among party
members.

It is declared that the votes receives both a plurality and a majority.
when there if made simple enough to be comprehended by the average voter,
would insure majority rule and at the same time allow adequate
representation of minorities. 446. OBSTACLES TO INTELLIGENTY VOTING.--Several
obstacles elect officials. The long who represent a_majority_, rather
than a Direct Primary has disorganized the party and has therefore
broken and down party. It is claimed that the Direct Primary has not
eliminated the boss, for rather than voting directly for candidates
of for these evils is the short ballot.

The essential features of the short ballot their own choice, electors
must make a selection from a list of candidates previously arranged
by party leaders.

All of these candidates may be objectionable to the voter.

It is also pointed out that many worthy candidates have the money to
defray the expense of said for and against the Direct Primary, the belief
is gaining ground that it has not, in twenty years or more of
experience, demonstrated that it can achieve positive results of a
measurably satisfactory character. It has not rid the state of boss
domination; it has increased the expense which every candidate must,
and it gives a marked advantage to the man whose name is well known
to the voters, whether he be a professional politician or not. To say
that the primary secures on average somewhat better results than the
old convention may be stating the truth, it is not high praise."
443. NOMINATION BY PETITION.--The system it enables independent candidates
to be brought forward.

On the other hand, it has encouraged the circulation of petitions for
hire. On the whole this method of nomination is proving more and more
popular in local elections. It seems well adapted to the needs of
municipalities, for it reduces partisanship to a minimum. It is said
that in some cases it practically eliminates national politics from
local elections. The supporters of nomination by. MAJORITY REPRESENTATION.--How
can we make certain that an be individual nominated or elected represents
a majority of those voting?

When there are are several candidates, it often happens that the individual
receiving the largest number of votes does not receive a. majority.

Suppose, for, that 100,000 votes are cast, and that A receives
20,000, B nomination of candidates for most local, state, and National
offices. 437. DECLINE OF THE CONVENTION.

--The convention was an improvement upon the caucus in that it
allowed a greater number of party members to participate in
nominations.

Unfortunately, delegates to the convention continued to be chosen
in local caucuses, where the party"ring" or machine usually determined
the choice of delegates.

Bosses prepared" successful because he has received may southern
states it is the practice to require an absolute majority for
election.

If through the_preferential voting_ device. This system of voting allows
the voter memory to designate arranged not only his first, but his second
and third choices as well.

If any candidate receives a clear majority of first choice votes, he is

choices are resorted to.

In cities where the plan has competing in the Direct Primaries. Frequently
the"ring" brings out a number of candidates to divide the voters,
while the henchmen the ring concentrate their votes upon one man.

Lastly, it is pointed out, the excessive number of candidates to, be
selected renders it impossible for the average individual to make an
intelligent selection. In such a case, the average individual attends
the Direct Primary was, nevertheless it is probably true that
the slackness of the individual is the chief reason why voters neglect
to use other small areas. of the caucus.

The caucus the was an of indifference to civic duty, or of preoccupation
with the press of informal meeting in which the local members of a
political party nominated candidates for town and county offices.
Candidates for state offices were named by a legislative In these
areas it is used for the purpose of nominating candidates for local
offices, and for the purpose of electing delegates to nominating
conventions.

Except in some parts of the ballot. This slackness choice of party leaders.
442.

OUTLOOK FOR THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--Although there is much to be been
tried, preferential voting is said to have proved markedly successful.
445.

MINORITY REPRESENTATION.--Related to the question of making sure that
successful candidates represent a majority of those voting is the problem
of the adequate representation of the minority. The most notorious
phase of this problem has grown out of our custom of electing one national
Representative from each the increasing population of the country declared
elected. But if no one receives such a majority, the second party,
held for the purpose of allowing party members to choose the candidates
who will represent the choices are added to the of the congressional
districts into which every state is divided.

Often gerrymandering[ Footnote: The origin and nature of"gerrymandering"
are discussed in Chapter XLII, Sections 542 and 543.] is Congress,
because the party having a bare majority often secures a large
percentage of the representatives, while the minority is very
inadequately represented.

Such misrepresentation also appears in connection with the choice of
representatives to the state legislatures. In the attempt to remedy this
type of misrepresentation upon one candidate, an average minority can
be sure of at least one representative in each district. A plan employed
in several other states likewise aims to give each political party
representation proportional to the the number of votes project by the
party, regardless of whether the number is a minority or a majority. The
principle to intelligent voting in this country are intimately
connected with the long ballot.[ Footnote: The term"long ballot" refers
to the fact that so many officials are elective that the ballot
on which their names appear often of great length.

The term" short ballot frequency of elections, has made it impossible
for the average voter to exercise proper judgment the polls. The last
century had the double effect of increasing the number of elective
offices, and of shortening the terms during which officials were allowed
to hold office. A greatly lengthened ballot, together with the choosing
those officials who have to do with public policies. For example, state
voters ought to select only the governor, lieutenant governor, and
members of the legislature; city voters ought to choose only the mayor
and council; three same persons, or two votes for one candidate and one
for another, or all one candidate. By concentrating its votes follows:
Popular elections should be resorted to only for the purpose of was
supposed to be an is allowed to[ Footnote: Where this form of municipal
government is still employed.] while county voters ought to confine
their attention to a small group of county commissioners or supervisors.
All other officials ought to be appointed, either directly by chief
executive officers, or by means of the merit program. Along with the
shortening of the ballot, we should be increasingly willing to
allow officials to hold office for longer terms A supplementary feature
of great value would be the establishment of such means of
popular control as would protect the public against abuse of power by
officials to whom longer terms had been extended. 448. MERITS OF THE
SHORT BALLOT.--There can be little doubt that a drastic of this party
election. There is provision for polling under detailed legal control.
Such laws generally prescribe the time and place resorted to, that is
to say, congressional districts are so arranged as to give the minority
party overwhelming majorities in shortening of the ballot would work a
great improvement in our electoral system.

If the vast majority of officials were made appointive, the voter could
give more time and thought to the consideration of a few important
elective officials.

A short ballot would lessen the possibilities of manipulation by rings
and bosses. Unquestionably the interest of the to voter would be
quickened, since his influence upon the political life of his community
would be more apparent. And not only would the short ballot make
government more representative, but it would help to make it more
responsible. If the majority of the administrative officials who are
now elected were made appointive, responsibility for their conduct in
office could be concentrated upon the chief executive officer
appointing them. 449. THE NEGLECT TO that duty, his own tendency
toward slackness is encouraged. In a democracy, as Lord Bryce points
out,"everybody's business becomes nobody's business." 450. IMPORTANCE
OF CIVIC EDUCATION.--The perfecting of our nominating and elective
machinery, together with the shortening of the ballot, is doing a
good deal to awaken interest in the proper use of the vote. But the
problems of democracy cannot be solved by purely mechanical means. If our
voters are to regard the use of the ballot as a civic duty, we must
rely upon civic education.
The mosquitoes at Sicamous are as great a menace to that town as the
Germans are to Europe.

The train for the valley, when on time, leaves Sicamous, on the main
line of the C.P.R., at about ten, good morning, but sometimes she waits
for the delayed eastern train. This happens very frequently on
Sundays--for who or what was ever on time on a Sunday? Sunday is the
lazy man's day--the lazy day of the world--the day on which we creep
along out of tune with things.

Now, when you get side-tracked at a C.P.R. station in the Rocky
Mountains waiting for a delayed eastern train, you may as well throw all
your plans into the lake, because they will be out of fashion when you
have an opportunity to use them again, and you will require new
ones--the train may come to-day and she may not come till to-morrow.
But, if that station chances to be Sicamous, and it is Sunday--and it
must be raining heavily, for when it is raining there are no
mosquitoes--you will not regret the delay, and you will be very much
interested if you have an eye for the unique, or if you have the
slightest inclination to be eccentric you will be reminded that--

        There are friends we never meet;
        There is love we never know.

Here people--strangers and friends--meet and nod, smile, talk and depart
ten or twelve times every day. You will wonder how people can talk so
much, and what they get to talk about--people who meet accidentally
here, only for a moment, and will never meet again, perhaps. Almost
hourly, night and day, cosmopolitan little throngs jump from trains,
chat a few moments among themselves, or with others who have been
waiting, and then allow themselves to be picked up by the next train and
rushed off into eternity--that is, so far as you are concerned, for you
will never see them again--and some of them were becoming so familiar.
They are voices and faces flitting across your past; they are always
new, always strange, always interesting; they are laughing, chatting,
smiling, scowling, worrying. There are fair faces and dark faces,
pleasant faces and angry faces, careless faces and anxious faces, and
faces that are thin, fat, long and short. The voices are as varied as
the faces. There is the sharp, clear voice and the dull voice, the
angry one and the pleasant one. There are young and old, beautiful and
ugly, scowls and smiles, the timid and the fearless--the black, the
white, and the yellow; and there are faces that look so much like ones
you know at home that you are just on the point of asking them how the
boys and girls have been since you left. If they had known that they
were the actors on a stage, and you were the audience, conditions might
have been improved--artificially; they might have acted better, with
more "class," but the interest would have been injured; you would have
been robbed of a genuine entertainment. Those people went north, south,
east and west; they went to the four corners of the earth. The sound of
their voices and laughs go up into the tree-tops, up into the hills and
down into the lake, and they are echoed back to us; and that is the only
record that is ever taken, of this interesting drama; and then the
voices fade away east--fade away west.

But you hear the elaborate puffing and snorting of a locomotive as
though laboring under its great load of humanity; there is a loud
whistle from somewhere, and then another; two engines are speaking to
each other; then the bell rings, the engine sweeps by, and the whole
earth trembles--it is the delayed eastern train. There is a great
scramble for entrance. Chance acquaintances are forgotten in the
individual excitement. The steps to one car are blocked by one man who
has enough baggage for ten, and one worried-looking young lady with a
baby is afraid she will lose her train. The train pulls out with a
"swish, swish" of escaping steam under great pressure from the engine,
and the station is robbed of half its population. The familiar faces
have disappeared, but a new throng has been cast into your midst--new
faces, new smiles, new voices, new scowls; and the chatter is renewed
with vigor when we have found ourselves, and are located in several
little isolated bunches. But the Okanagan local is here waiting for our
scalps. There is another scramble of men, women, children, bag and
baggage, for seats, and we are off. The little station platform is
deserted and silent but for the clatter of the wheels of the baggage
truck. The tree tops sigh, the lake murmurs, but they cannot hold us, we
must hurry to the great beyond--the whole world depends upon our
individual movements.


Of the Ubiquitous Cat


Once upon a time I had a very curious experience which had a very
curious ending.

I walked into a strange person's house, uninvited, for some mysterious
reason perfectly unknown to myself.

Sitting promiscuously around an old-fashioned fire-place, in which
blazed a cheery fire, were a man and woman and four small children; and
on a lounge, partly hid under the eiderdown quilt, lay a pure white cat,
half asleep and half awake, and at intervals casting sly glances at some
of the children. The cat seemed to all intent and purpose one of that
human family.

Now, although the cat can be abused like a toy doll by the children
without losing his temper, yet he has the most curiously composed
disposition of all the domestic animals. Although extravagantly
domesticated, and although he shares our beds and tables with impunity,
yet he is, to the mouse, as cruel and treacherous as a man-eating tiger.

However, we did not take up our pen to discuss cat psychology. Upon
entering the strange person's house so unceremoniously, I sat me down
upon a vacant chair, also uninvited, and began to make myself at home.

The strange persons did not seem to take any exception to my strange
behavior, but, kept on talking as though nothing extraordinary had
taken place in the human social regulations. I was more interested in
the cat than I was in the people, and I could not keep my eye from him,
he was so much like our "Teddy" at home.

At last I convinced myself that it _was_ Teddy.

"Where did you get that cat?" I asked.

"Why, we have always had him. We raised him. He sleeps with the children
every night, and gets up with them in the morning--when he is here,"
said the mother.

Our Teddy had the same weakness, and I was so positive that this was he
that I called him by name.

In a moment he came to me and was on my knee--it was indeed Teddy.

Now, here was one of the most unique situations on record.

"This is my cat," I said demandingly.

"It is ours," said the chorus of children's voices.

It suddenly occurred to me that Teddy was in the habit of leaving home
and would be absent for several days at a time. Could it be possible he
had two homes? Did this cat actually accept the affections and
hospitality of two distinct families, at the same time, without once
breathing the truth or giving himself away?

I went home puzzled to my wife and said:

"Do you know, Teddy is not all ours?"

"What do you mean?"

I was just about to tell my strange story when I awoke, and, behold, it
was a dream.


BITS OF HISTORY


Of the Foolhardy Expedition


The people who inhabited this globe during the year 1725 undoubtedly
obtained a different view of things terrestrial than we do who claim the
world's real estate in 1915, because they had no telegraph, no
telephone, no electric light, no automobile, and no aeroplane. How they
managed to live at all is a mystery to the twentieth century biped.
Fancy having to cross the street to your neighbor's house when you
wanted to ask him if he was going to the pioneer supper, and just think
of having no "hello girl" to flirt with. The condition seems appalling.
But what they lacked in knowledge and in indolent conveniences we beg to
announce that they made up in foolhardiness which they called bravery.
Well, if it can be called brave to make a needless target of oneself to
a bunch of savage Indians, why then they had the proper derivation of
the term.

From one of Francis Parkman's admirable works we have seized upon the
scene of our story, which was acted out at the beginning of the
eighteenth century, namely, 1725. The Indians seem to have been very
hostile in those early days in the immediate vicinity of the early New
England provinces; and we are convinced some of the white men were very
hostile as well. Of course we, in our day, cannot blame them--they had
no telephones, autos, electricity, "hello girls"--they had to be
something, so they were hostile towards the Indians.

Dunstable was a town on the firing line of Massachusetts, and was
attacked by Indians in the autumn of 1724, and two men were carried off.
Ten others went in pursuit, but fell into an ambush, and nearly all were
killed. But now we will follow the words of Francis Parkman, who has a
delightful way of relating his stories.

"A company of thirty was soon raised." They were to receive two
shillings and sixpence per day each, "out of which he was to maintain
himself";--very little to risk one's life for; but in those days it was
no concern with a man whether he was killed or not. Besides, it was
worth something to get killed and have Francis Parkman write about you
more than a century later. Perhaps they anticipated this perpetuation of
their names and deeds.

However, "Lovewell was chosen captain; Farwell lieutenant, and Robbins,
ensign. They set out towards the end of November, and reappeared at
Dunstable early in January, bringing one prisoner and one scalp." It
does not seem to us to have paid the interest on the investment of two
shillings and sixpence per day, "out of which he was to maintain
himself," and, for anything we know to the contrary, perhaps the captain
was getting more than this--it has not been recorded. "Towards the end
of the month Lovewell set out again, this time with eighty-seven men.
They ascended the frozen Merrimac, passed Lake Winnepesaukee, pushed
nearly to the White Mountains, and encamped on a branch of the upper
Saco. Here they killed a moose--a timely piece of luck, for they were in
danger of starvation, and Lovewell had been compelled by want of food to
send back a good number of his men. The rest held their way, filing on
snowshoes through the deathlike solitude that gave no sign of life
except the light track of some squirrel on the snow, and the brisk note
of the hardy little chickadee, or black-capped titmouse, so familiar in
the winter woods."

Now here is where the foolhardiness of the expedition begins to appeal
to us. Supposing just here they had met five hundred crazy Indians with
five hundred crazy bows and arrows? And they must have expected it. They
were searching for Indians. Perhaps they were seeking martyrdom? But the
New Englander of the frontier was nothing if not foolhardy. They mistook
it for bravery, and there must have been some bravery amalgamated with
it, because a man must have a certain quantity of that rarity before he
can lend himself out as a target at two shillings and sixpence a day,
"out of which he was to maintain himself."

Now, if you have patience to follow you will learn that they ultimately
met the very thing which you expect--which they must have expected.

"Thus far the scouts had seen no human footprints; but on the twentieth
of February they found a lately abandoned wigwam, and following the
snowshoe tracks that led from it--" Right into the lion's jaw, as it
were. Perhaps they were anxious to be shot to get out of their
misery--"at length saw smoke rising at a distance out of the gray
forest." They saw their finish, and their hearts were filled with joy.
"The party lay close till two o'clock in the morning; then, cautiously
approaching, found one or more wigwams, surrounded them, and killed all
the inmates, ten in number." They were to pay dear for this, as anyone
could have told them. "They brought home the scalps in triumph, ... and
Lovewell began at once to gather men for another hunt.... At the middle
of April he had raised a band of forty-six." One of the number was Seth
Wyman, ... a youth of twenty-one, graduated at Harvard College, in 1723,
and now a student of theology. Chaplain though he was, he carried a gun,
knife and hatchet like the others, and not one of the party was more
prompt to use them.... They began their march on April 15th." After
leaving several of their number by the way for various causes, we find
thirty-seven of them on the night of May 7th near Fryeburg lying in the
woods near the northeast end of Lovewell's pond.

"At daybreak the next morning, as they stood bareheaded, listening to a
prayer from the young chaplain, they heard the report of a gun, and soon
after an Indian.... Lovewell ordered his men to lay down their packs and
advance with extreme caution." Why this caution? "They met an Indian
coming towards them through the dense trees and bushes. He no sooner saw
them than he fired at the leading men." Naturally. We should have said
"leading targets." "His gun was charged with beaver shot and he severely
wounded Lovewell and young Whiting; on which Seth Wyman shot him dead,
and the chaplain and another man scalped him." As yet they had only
entered the lion's den. "And now follows one of the most obstinate and
deadly bush-fights in the annals of New England.... The Indians howled
like wolves, yelled like enraged cougars, and made the forest ring with
their whoops.... The slaughter became terrible. Men fell like wheat
before the scythe. At one time the Indians ceased firing; ... they
seemed to be holding a 'pow-wow'; but the keen and fearless Wyman crept
up among the bushes, shot the chief conjurer, and broke up the meeting.
About the middle of the afternoon young Fry received a mortal wound.
Unable to fight longer, he lay in his blood, praying from time to time
for his comrades in a faint but audible voice." One, Keys, received two
wounds, "but fought on till a third shot struck him." He declared the
Indians would not get his scalp. Creeping along the sandy edge of the
pond, he chanced to find a stranded canoe, pushed it afloat, rolled
himself into it, and drifted away before the wind. Soon after sunset the
Indians drew off.... The surviving white men explored the scene of the
fight.... Of the thirty-four men, nine had escaped without serious
injury, eleven were badly wounded, and the rest were dead or dying....
Robbins, as he lay helpless, asked one of them to load his gun, saying,
'The Indians will come in the morning to scalp me, and I'll kill
another of them if I can.' They loaded the gun and left him." The
expected had occurred. Most of them had been killed. Anyone could have
told them this before they set out--they could have made the same
prophecy for themselves. And after all they had accomplished nothing but
their own deaths. The story of their return rivals that of Napoleon's
retreat from Moscow. Of the whole number eleven ultimately reached home.
We leave it to the reader to determine whether this was an exhibition of
bravery or foolhardiness, or a mixture of both.

We congratulate ourselves that we did not live on the frontier of New
England in the year 1725.


Of the Laws of Lycurgus


Lycurgus reigned over a place called Lacedæmon, which is a part of
Greece, about the year 820 B.C. Now, this is a great many years ago, and
is further back into the archives of history than most of us can
remember. There is no doubt, however, that this great ruler, Lycurgus,
was crazy, or he was one of those persons whose brains cease to develop
after they have left their teens. He certainly secures the first prize
as a "whim" strategist. In spite of his insane eccentricities, he was
allowed the full exercise of his freedom. Had he flourished in 1915 A.D.
instead of 820 "B.C." (which does not mean British Columbia), the asylum
for the insane at New Westminster would not have been strong enough to
retain him. Lycurgus did one redeeming thing--he founded a Senate;
"which, sharing,"--we are following Plutarch--"as Plato says, in the
power of the kings, too imperious and unrestrained before, and having
equal authority with them, was the means of keeping them within bounds
of moderation, and highly contributed to the preservation of the State.
The establishment of a Senate, an intermediate body, like ballast, kept
it in just equilibrium, and put it in a safe posture: the twenty-eight
senators adhering to the kings whenever they saw the people too
encroaching, and on the other hand, supporting the people, when the
kings attempted to make themselves absolute."

Now, what in the world possessed this despotic imbecile to form a
senate? His action in this can only be accounted for in the light that
it was one of those unpremeditated whims of a narrow-minded faddist. One
naturally wonders what the newly created senators were doing while the
king was imposing his insane laws. This body was formed for the
"preservation of the state." The wonder is that there was any state
left, for the king paralyzed commerce, smothered ambition, choked art to
death, and placed a ban on modesty. Further than having been "formed,"
the "Senate" never again appears on the pages of the "Lycurgus" book.

Plutarch, who lived in Greece about the year 100 A.D., nine hundred
years after the subject of his biography, relates the forming and
imposing of those laws with the utmost faith, and the most implicit
innocence; which goes to prove that the Grecian idea of government, with
all its knowledge, had not advanced much, at least up to the time of
Plutarch.

And now for the laws.

"A second and bolder political enterprise of Lycurgus was a new division
of the lands. For he found a prodigious inequality; the city overcharged
with many indigent persons, who had no land; and the wealth centred in
the hands of the few. Determined, therefore, to root out the evils of
insolence, envy, avarice, and luxury, and those distempers of a state
still more inveterate than fatal--I mean poverty and riches--he
persuaded them to cancel all former divisions of land and to make new
ones, in such a manner as they might be perfectly equal in their
possessions and way of living.

His proposal was put in practice.

"After this he attempted to divide also the movables, in order to take
away all appearance of inequality; but he soon perceived that they could
not bear to have their goods taken directly from them, and therefore
took another method, counterworking their avarice by a stratagem."

Now, this seems to be the only law to which they made objection; and
this proves that the love of personal "icties" has very deep roots.
Perhaps the influence of the "senate" sustained them in this, for
qualifications for a senator, even in those days, must have called for
men of some means, and they, when the shoe began to pinch their own
feet, would not care to divide up their sugar and flour with the rank
and file. It does not appear, however, that they had any say in the
matter, and, beyond the statement that they were formed for a purpose,
they seem to have taken no part in the affairs of state; if they had,
Lycurgus and his laws would never have been made part of history.

"First he stopped the currency of the gold and silver coin"--thus he
paralyzed industry--"and ordered that they should make use of iron money
only; then to a great quantity and weight of this he assigned but a
small value.... In the next place he excluded unprofitable and
superfluous arts.... Their iron coin would not pass in the rest of
Greece, but was ridiculed and despised, so that the Spartans had no
means of purchasing any foreign or curious wares, nor did any merchant
ship unlade in their harbor." Even Plutarch sees nothing suicidal in all
this voluntary isolating of themselves from the main arteries of
commerce.

"Desirous to complete the conquest of luxury and exterminate the love of
riches, he introduced a third institution, which was wisely enough and
ingeniously contrived. This was the use of public tables, where all were
to eat in common of the same meat, and such kinds of it as were
appointed by law. At the same time they were forbidden to eat at home,
or on expensive couches and tables.... Another ordinance levelled
against magnificence and expense, directed that the ceilings of houses
should be wrought with no tool but the axe, and the doors with nothing
but the saw. Indeed, no man could be so absurd as to bring into a
dwelling so homely and simple, bedsteads with silver feet, purple
coverlets, or golden cups." Thus he smothered art and personal ambition,
two of the most requisite essentials to a people on their onward and
upward trend to civilization and success. "A third ordinance of Lycurgus
was, that they should not often make war against the same enemy, lest,
by being frequently put upon defending themselves, they too should
become able warriors in their turn."

And thus he made them defenceless against their enemies.

"For the same reason he would not permit all that desired to go abroad
and see other countries, lest they should contract foreign manners, gain
traces of a life of little discipline, and of a different form of
government. He forbade strangers, too, to resort to Sparta who could not
assign a good reason for their coming!"

Improvement with Lycurgus means retrogression with us. He wished,
perhaps ignorantly, to arrest the progress of civilization and
substitute a slovenly ideal of his own. His purpose was to cancel the
civilization which the race had gained during thousands of years of
effort, and bring it back to a semi-savagery. But the world was too big
for him. It had things in view which were too great for his small,
hampered mind to have any suspicion of. No doubt he was sincere in his
little, infinitesimal way; but it is a blessing for the world that his
influence was confined to a very small corner of the then civilized
world, and that others of broader views succeeded him to manage the
affairs of states and nations. With all deference to old Plutarch, the
biographer of Lycurgus, we wish to say that however grand the laws of
this man may have been as ideals, they were utter failures when brought
into practice.


Of Joan of Arc


Some people say the world is getting no better, but if we take a dip
into history and consider the conditions which prevailed there from the
earliest times up to only a few hundred years ago, we will find a race
of human beings which in no wise resemble the present output except in
form and stature. And our own forefathers--the people of the British
Isles, the Anglo-Saxons who are to-day leading in the social world--were
not one iota better throughout those pages than many of the smallest and
most unpretentious of obscure tribes living here and there in ignorant,
local isolation. One of the strongest points in our argument is the fact
that history, as we have it, is composed of the clang of battles and the
private lives of kings and despots. The ordinary, everyday life of the
peasant people--the working classes--the backbone of the nation, so to
speak--was beneath the consideration of the historian throughout all
times. The only virtue, in his estimation, was a strong arm--a large
army to murder and destroy property. And the life of the historian must
needs reflect that of the people. There is no doubt that in a great
majority they were of a cruel, murderous nature. We get rare glimpses,
however (at intervals of sometimes hundreds of years), of the doings,
manners, and customs, likes and dislikes of the common people, that we
can rely upon as authentic; the rest is poetry and legend, and,
although typical, are relations of incidents that did not really occur.

There is no doubt that, although it has been withheld, there was a great
deal of virtue, which blushed and bloomed unseen, amid all this blood
and war.

As though by accident the historian who immortalized Joan of Arc has let
slip a few words in connection with this heroine's early life that are
more valuable to us than page upon page of some of our so-called
history. "Jeanne d'Arc was the child of a laborer of Domremy, a little
village on the borders of Lorraine and Champagne. Just without the
cottage where she was born began the great woods of the Vosges, where
the children of Domremy drank in poetry and legend from fairy ring and
haunted well, hung their flower garlands on the sacred trees and sang
songs to the good people who might not drink of the fountain because of
their sins. Jeanne loved the forest; its birds and beasts came lovingly
to her at her childish call. But at home men saw nothing in her but 'a
good girl,' simple and pleasant in her way, spinning and sewing by her
mother's side while the other girls went to the fields--tender to the
poor and sick."

This is a little domestic scene of the year A.D. 1425, and how homelike
and real and familiar it all is. What a sweet peace spot, among all the
bloodshed and horror that was going on throughout France at that time.

Joan of Arc is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable characters in all
history. She was born at Domremy, France, in 1412, and was executed in
1431. Before she had reached twenty this girl had practically freed
France from the English, or at least put the country upon such a footing
that a few years accomplished its freedom.

The superstitions of the times are no doubt responsible to a great
extent for the success which was attained by this Maid of Orleans. "The
English believed in her supernatural mission as firmly as the French
did, but they thought her a sorceress who had come to overthrow them by
her enchantments," and so on. The fact remains that this innocent
peasant girl of eighteen years of age freed France from the English and
accomplished things which no man of France at that time was able to do.
Either the French generalship of the times was very incompetent or the
army was very much demoralized--at all events they had been awaiting the
advent of a leader who was both determined and fearless, for skill does
not seem to have been a requisite--and this appeared in the person of
Joan of Arc.

It is difficult to believe that an entirely inexperienced person of this
kind could take charge of an army of ten thousand men and lead them to
victory when the best trained generals of the time could do nothing and
suffered defeat at every turn.

With the coronation of the King the Maid felt that her errand was over.
"Oh, gentle king, the pleasure of God is done," she cried, as she flung
herself at the feet of Charles, and asked leave to go home. "Would it
were His good will," she pleaded with the archbishop, as he forced her
to remain, "that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and
my brothers; they would be glad to see me again."

But the policy of the French court detained her. France was depending on
one of its peasant girls for its very national existence. The
humiliation of the thing should make all good Frenchmen blush with
shame. So she fought on with the conviction that she was superfluous in
the army, and a slave to the French court. It does not appear that she
was even placed upon the payroll, or that she received reward of any
kind for her services--and there were no "Victoria crosses" in those
days. She fought on without pay; rendered all her services for
nothing--perhaps for the love of the thing. During the defence of
Compiegne in May, 1430, she fell into the hands of one Vendome, who sold
her to the Duke of Burgundy. Burgundy sold her to the English--her
remuneration for her self-sacrificing, voluntarily-given services.

And now comes the tragic part of a most pathetic story enacted out at a
time when the name civilization, applied to the French and English, is a
mockery. "In December she was carried to Rouen, the headquarters of the
English, heavily fettered, and flung into a gloomy prison, and at
length, arraigned before the spiritual tribunal of the Bishop of
Beauvais, a wretched creature of the English, as a sorceress and a
heretic, while the dastard she had crowned king left her to die." She
was not even granted a legal, judicial trial.

Some say that her sentence was at one time commuted to perpetual
imprisonment, which proves that there was a glimmer of humanity hid away
in some corner of the world, knocking hysterically in its imprisonment
for admission. "But the English found a pretext to treat her as a
criminal and condemned her to be burned." And at this juncture it may be
well to say that we have good reason to be proud of ourselves to-day,
and ashamed of our ancestors.

The question of passage is put by the Speaker immediately after the third
reading.

557. DEBATE UPON THE BILL.--Debate in the House of Representatives has
little influence upon most bills, the fate of a measure being practically
determined by the committee considering it. Most speeches are frankly
intended for political purposes, and for circulation in the Congressional
Record, rather than as actual and positive influences upon the bill
which is being discussed.

Debate in the House is limited in several ways. No member may spend more
than an hour in debate upon any question, except the member in charge of
the bill. This member may have an additional hour at the close.
In the committee of the whole, speeches are limited to five minutes.
No member may speak more than once on the same subject without
special permission from the chair. The single exception to this rule
is the member who has introduced the bill. Before debate begins,
the chairman of the committee in charge of the bill arranges, in
consultation with the Speaker, a list of members who are to be heard
upon the bill. No other members are ordinarily recognized by the Speaker
in the ensuing debate.

After a certain amount of discussion the member in charge of the
bill will generally move the previous question in order to cut short
the debate and bring the House to a direct vote upon the question.
558.

THE VOTE.--In the House voting may be by any one of three methods.
Voting may be by "sound of voices." In this case the Speaker calls in
turn for the "ayes" and "noes," and decides by the volume of the
sound whether the motion has been carried or lost.

This is usually the method first employed, but either of the other
two methods may be demanded before or after voting by sound of
voices has been employed.

Voting may be by tellers. When this is decided upon the members pass
between tellers appointed by the Speaker--those in the affirmative
first--and are counted. This method requires the demand of one
fifth of a quorum.Although the actual incident
never occurred, it is typical of what was going on among that long dead
people, and it is of as much importance to us as the most valuable
record of history, and is of vital interest when viewed in retrospect
from the year 1915, because it gives us a rare glimpse into the domestic
manners of a people who lived when all the present civilized world was
in the hands of savages--and how modern it all seems. The scene might
have been enacted yesterday even to the smallest detail.

Imagine yourself in the city of Alexandria about the year 280 B.C.

"Some Syracusan women staying at Alexandria, agreed, on the occasion of
a great religious solemnity--the feast of Adonis--to go together to the
palace of King Ptolemy Philadelphus, to see the image of Adonis, which
the Queen Arsinoe, Ptolemy's wife, had had decorated with peculiar
magnificence. A hymn, by a celebrated performer, was to be recited over
the image. The names of the two women are Gorgo and Praxinoe; their
maids, who are mentioned in the poem, are called Eunoe and Eutychis.
Gorgo comes by appointment to Praxinoe's house to fetch her, and there
the dialogue begins."

is! how exquisite! Why, they might wear it in heaven!

P. Heavenly patroness of needle-women, what hands we hired to do that
work? Who designed those beautiful patterns? They seem to stand up and
move about, as if they were real--as if they were living things and not
needlework. Well, man is a wonderful creature! And look, look, how
charming he lies there on his silver couch, with just a soft down on his
cheeks, that beloved Adonis--Adonis, whom one loves, even though he is
dead!

Another Stranger. You wretched woman, do stop your incessant chatter.

Syracusan women? If you want to know, we came originally from Corinth,

be allowed to have a Dorian accent.

P. Oh, honey-sweet Proserpine, let us have no more masters than the one
we've got! We don't the least care for you; pray don't trouble yourself
for nothing.

G. Be quiet, Praxinoe! That first-rate singer, the Argive woman's
daughter, is going to sing the Adonis hymn. She is the same who was
chosen to sing the dirge last year. We are sure to have something first
rate from her. She is going through her airs and graces ready to begin.

       *       *       *       *       *

And here the voices die away in the remote past. How difficult it is to
believe that this dialogue took place more than two thousand years ago!

As a last glimpse of such a beautiful, modernly remote gem of
conversation, we will give a few more words to show what those ancient
gossipy ladies thought of their husbands.

The following are the last surviving words which Gorgo gave to the
world:

Gorgo. Praxinoe, certainly women are wonderful things. That lucky woman,
to know all that; and luckier still to have such a voice! And now we
must see about getting home. My husband has not had his dinner. That man
is all vinegar, and nothing else; and if you keep him waiting for his
dinner he's dangerous to go near. Adieu! precious Adonis, and may you
find us all well when you come next year!

He might have been a husband of yesterday!

For how many years have the husbands been coming home from work daily to
partake of a meal which an attentive and tender wife has prepared for
him? This was twenty-two hundred years ago.


Of the White Woman Who Became an Indian Squaw


The early history of the northwest frontier of Massachusetts is fraught
with blood-curdling tales of savage invasions against the home-builders
and empire-makers of that once troubled boundary between the French of
Canada and the English of the New England States, but there is not a
more pitiful story than that which has been recorded touching the
Williams family of Deerfield, who were captured by the Indians during
one of their inroads in the year 1704. John Williams was a minister who
had come to Deerfield when it was still suffering from the ruinous
effects of King Philip's war. His parishioners built him a house, he
married, and had eight children. The story of the Indians' invasion, the
destruction of the village, and the capture of over one hundred
prisoners is admirably told by Francis Parkman in one of those excellent
works of his dealing with the old régime of Canada and New England.

"A war party of about fifty Canadians and two hundred Indians left
Quebec about mid-winter, and arrived at Deerfield on the 28th of
February, 1704. Savage and hungry, they lay shivering under the pines
till about two hours before dawn the following morning; then, leaving
their packs and their snowshoes behind, they moved cautiously towards
their prey. The hideous din startled the minister, Williams, from his
sleep. Half naked, he sprang out of bed, and saw, dimly, a crowd of
savages bursting through the shattered door. With more valor than
discretion he snatched a pistol that hung at the head of the bed, cocked
it and snapped it at the breast of the foremost Indian. It missed fire.
Amid the screams of his terrified children, three of the party seized
him and bound him fast, for they came well provided with cords, as
prisoners had a great market value. Nevertheless, in the first fury of
their attack, they dragged to the door and murdered two of the children.
They kept Williams shivering in his shirt for an hour, while a frightful
uproar of yells, shrieks, and gunshots sounded from within. At length
they permitted him, his wife, and five remaining children to dress
themselves. After the entire village had been destroyed and the
inhabitants either murdered or made captive, Williams and his wife and
family were led from their burning house across the Connecticut River to
the foot of the mountain, and the following day the march north began
with the hundred or more prisoners."

The hardships of the prisoners, and the crimes of the victors during
that long and arduous march north through snow and ice, forms a chapter
of pathos in the early history of those eastern states.

"At the mouth of the White River the party divided, and the Williams
family were separated and carried off in various directions. Eunice, the
youngest daughter, about eight years old, was handed over by the
Indians to the mission at St. Louis on their arrival there, and although
many efforts were made on the part of the Governor, who had purchased
and befriended Williams, to ransom her, the Jesuits flatly refused to
give her up. On one occasion he went himself with the minister to St.
Louis. This time the Jesuits, whose authority within their mission
seemed almost to override that of the Governor himself, yielded so far
as to allow the father to see his daughter, on condition that he spoke
to no other English prisoner. He spoke to her for an hour, exhorting her
never to forget her catechism, which she had learned by rote. The
Governor and his wife afterwards did all in their power to procure her
ransom, but of no avail.

"'She is there still,' writes Williams two years later, 'and has
forgotten to speak English.' What grieved him still more, Eunice had
forgotten her catechism." But now we come to this strange
transformation, unprecedented, we think, which made an Indian squaw out
of a white woman. "Eunice, reared among Indian children, learned their
language and forgot her own; she lived in a wigwam of the Caughnawagas,
forgot her catechism, was baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, and in
due time married an Indian of the tribe, who henceforth called himself
Williams. Thus her hybrid children bore her family name.

"Many years after, in 1740, she came, with her husband, to visit her
relatives at Deerfield, dressed as a squaw and wrapped in an Indian
blanket. Nothing would induce her to stay, though she was persuaded on
one occasion to put on a civilized dress and go to church, after which
she impatiently discarded her gown and resumed her blanket."

Could a sadder instance of degeneration be written in the annals of the
human family? "She was kindly treated by her relatives, and no effort
was made to detain her. She came again the following year, bringing two
of her children, and twice afterwards she repeated the visit. She and
her husband were offered land if they would remain, but she positively
refused, saying it would endanger her soul. She lived to a great age, a
squaw to the last. One of her grandsons became a missionary to the
Indians of Green Bay, Wisconsin."

This is one of the most drastic instances of a woman's devotion to
husband, and mother love for children driving her back to the forest of
her ancestors, and making her sacrifice all that her race had gained for
her during thousands of years. Thus the most natural and primitive
instincts of the human race will prevail against all our arts, science
and accomplishments.
