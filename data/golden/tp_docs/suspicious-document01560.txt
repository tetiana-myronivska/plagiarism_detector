"My dear Constance"--so it ran--"I should like to make your
acquaintance, and I hear that you are at Oxford with your uncle. I would
come and see you but that I never leave home. Oxford, too, depresses me
dreadfully. The young cat seized hold of one, and wanted to play with it,
but it slipped into the hole and she could see no more of it. The
other little mouse was running away as fast as it could, but Puss sprang
at it and gave it a nip which made it quiet enough.

Puss soon became a good hand at killing mice, but her pride received
a severe check, for one day a large rat was running across the barn,
and Puss thinking it was a large mouse ran to seize it, but the
rat turned round and seized Puss by the nose and bit her severely so
that she went away to her mother, mewing very piteously with her face
all swelled and covered with blood.

Puss durst not meddle with rats for a long time after this, but at
length she got stronger and would kill them and many other such vermin.

She had plenty of work, for there were many rats at the farm house.
While pursuing a large rat one day, she set her foot into a trap which had
been set to catch them, and though she was taken out
very carefully by the farmer's daughters who were swinging in an old
tree at the bottom of the orchard, it hurt her very much and she was
lame for many weeks after.

[Illustration]
Puss was now become a fine, healthy, good looking cat, and a smart
looking Tom Cat in the neighbourhood paid his court to Miss Puss, and
asked her by kind looks and gentle actions if she would become his
wife.
Puss scolded and scratched for some time, but at length they made a
match of it, and in due time, Puss became a mother. She however,
notwithstanding all her skill in concealing them, was doomed to see
her small family torn from her, and share the same fate as her
brothers and sisters had experienced on former occasions.

As Puss was rambling in the fields some time after her confinement,
in pursuit of some birds, a number of gentlemen were coursing for
hares, and when the dogs saw Puss, they immediately started after
her.

Puss ran as fast as she could, but the dogs ran much faster than she,
and were just at her heels, when she reached a tree, and saved her life
by climbing up it.

[Illustration]
Puss was now safe from the dogs, and she remained in the tree for
some time before she durst come down again. On her return to the
farm house, three boys who had been to school, were playing in the
fields. Each boy had a large stick on his shoulder, and as soon as
they saw Puss, they ran after her. She again took refuge in a tree,
but the boys threw stones at her and hit her so hard, that she at
length fell senseless to the ground. One of the boys seized poor
Puss; and they were going to have some rare sport as they said, by
fastening the cat on a board, and then launching it on the pond,
after which they would set the dogs at her, and Puss could only
keep them off by scratching their noses.I don't tell any--if I can help.

"Oh, and there is Penfold Rectory not very far off--and a very nice man
there, though too 'broad' for Winifred. He tells me he's going to have
some people staying with him--a Mr. Sorell, and a young musician with a
Polish name--I can't remember it. Mr. Sorell's going to coach the young
man, or something. They're to be paying guests, for a month at least.
Mr. Powell was Mr. Sorell's college tutor--and Mr. Powell's dreadfully
poor--so I'm glad. No wife, mercifully!

"Anyway, you see, there are plenty of people about. Do come.

"I am, dear Constance,

      MARCIA RISBOROUGH."

For a week or more it was evident that going her her usual duties. The
principal events in, and of she was the living of poor Puss, end
was fast approaching, as her strength Scotland was nearly gone

"I know all that," said Constance impatiently. "The question is--do you
see me sitting in lodgings at Ryde with Aunt Ellen for five or six
weeks, doing a little fancy-work, and walking out with Aunt Ellen and
Alice on the pier?"

Her grey dress, and soft grey hat, were, he
supposed, perfect of their kind. But Oxford in the summer term was full
of pretty dresses. No, it must be her ease, her sureness of herself that
banished any awkward self-consciousness both in herself and her
companions, and allowed a man to do himself justice.

He forgot her recent snubs and went off at score about his own affairs,
his college, his prospects of winning a famous mathematical prize given
by the Berlin Academy, his own experience of German Universities, and
the shortcomings of Oxford. On these last he became scornfully voluble.
He was inclined to think he should soon cut it, and go in for public
life. These university towns were really very narrowing!

At the Cherwell
boat-house they found the two boats, with four or five men, and Nora, as
usual, taking charge of everything, at least till Herbert Pryce
should appear.

Connie was just stepping into the foremost boat, assisted by Herbert
Pryce, who was in his shirt-sleeves, while Lord Meyrick and another
Marmion man were already in the boat.

"Sorell, will you stroke the other boat?" said Pryce, "and Miss Nora,
will you have a cushion in the bows? Now I think we're made up. No--we
want another lady. And running his eyes over those still standing on the
bank, he called a plump little woman, the wife of a Llandaff tutor, who
had been walking with Mrs. "Ma!

Please, Ma!"

Munn lifted him up. Dick Roamer helped him, and between them they drew
him to the door, his heart-broken calls and cries piercing every corner
of the room.
They whisked him out of Mrs. Brenner's sight as quickly as they
could.
